B0017I1FO4|5.0|The Sound of Madness is Shinedown's best album yet...and just shows that band continues to grow for the better.  Can't wait to see what they do next.      The album offers heavy songs like \\"Devour\\", \\"Sound of Madness\\", \\"Cry For Help\\" for the times that you need to hear something loud, as well as some songs that are likely to hit you somewhere special like \\"The Crow & The Butterfly\\", \\"What A Shame\\", \\"Breaking Inside\\", \\"If You Only Knew\\" and \\"Call Me.\\"    One of the things that I love about the band is that when Brent writes and sings a song, you feel his emotion behind the lyrics.  It drags you in and makes you understand the meaning of the song, and you appreciate them that much more.  Hats off to Brent and his amazing skills...so glad that he decided to become a musician and grace the world with that voice; such a stunning voice...and for anyone that thinks his voice is fake, all you have to do is see them live to know that it's all him.      Even if you don't own either of Shinedown's first 2 albums, buy this one now!  You won't regret it.  I've been listening to it for 2 weeks straight on shuffle repeat in my car...and I just saw the band in concert last night (for the 3rd time).  They rocked hard!!!!  Can't wait to see them again!
817224164X|5.0|Mein Kampf is exactly like what it is infamous for. It is difficult reading and not because of any supposed complex philosophy. It is merely the rantings of a madman and I would not consider it worth buying since you can read it online.    I rated it 5 star because the book itself is very good, particularly the cover.

1594481717|4.0|\\"A Whole New Mind\\" is a fascinating and well-written book about right (and left) brain thinking. The author has an engaging style and has done meticulous research. Easy to read and clearly presented.
0545128285|4.0|If you keep in mind when you're reading this that \\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" are, infact, wizarding children's fairytales I think you can find the book to be great. I know people who were a bit disappointed in it, but the thing is it's not the Harry Potter books. It's related in the fact that it was mentioned in the final book and exists in the same fantasy world, but that's about it. It amuses me to think what some people had expected of this book.    As for the actual tales, I found them very entertaining and I could absolutely see the moral of them all. And I loved the added touch of Albus Dumbledore's commentary after each tale. To benefit the most out of the tales you simply have to imagine you were a young witch or wizard with magical abilities and they will seem so much better then they already are.
1416550518|1.0|This seemed like it would be a very interesting and intriging story, but I tried really hard and was only able to get about half-way through the book before I finally gave up!  I kept waiting for something to happen!  This was, for the most part, a very dull, daily record of a life of servitude.  I'm just glad I bought it used and didn't pay full price for it!
0316017922|4.0|Let me begin by assuring you that this is a fun, easy, interesting, and somewhat educational book.  It contains lots of little anecdotes that make for good conversation pieces, and challenges you to think about the subject and about life.  It is also well-written in a smooth, easy-to-read prose that will have you in and out of this short book without loosing your attention.  However, the overall argument of OUTLIERS is nothing new, surprising, or revolutionary in any way.  And for the most part it is poorly supported with anything more than small individual examples that were hand-picked to support the theories.<br /><br />The premise that \\"hard work\\" and \\"ability\\" are less important than luck, timing, and circumstance is neither firmly established nor surprising.  Obviously, being in the right place at the right time helps, and obviously having parents that encourage and educate their children helps, and obviously working hard and practicing long are necessary for success.  But none of this is anything new.  The first chapter of the book grabbed my attention and got me excited about the premise because of its honestly surprising and statistically convincing results.  It really is interesting that most hockey players in Canada are born toward the beginning of the year! But from there on the book becomes less and less compelling.<br /><br />Many of the examples Gladwell cites seem to be extremely isolated and unique cases that you'd have a hard time relating your life to in any way.  They might make for good stories, and are fairly interesting, but they really tell you very little about what it takes to be successful.  Pointing out the strange-seeming or unique circumstances that allowed these \\"outliers\\" to become successful (or terrible in the case of the Korean Air pilots) really doesn't lead to a common thesis, it simply highlights what everybody knows to be true: Much of life depends on circumstance and chance.<br /><br />Most regrettably, Gladwell ends the book with a call for action by society.  He believes that if people were given better opportunities, we would have more successful people, and I can't argue against that.  But, him positing that Canada could have twice as many hockey stars if they divided youth hockey leagues into two groups (one for people born during the first half of the year), is fairly preposterous.  I do believe Canada only needs so many hockey stars, and adding more to the current group would by necessity only replace the currently least talented.  Also, we wouldn't have ended up with hundreds of Bill Gates' if more people his age had been given access to computers when he did.. Again, preposterous.<br /><br />Overall though, this is an enjoyable book.  Don't expect it to change your outlook on life, but read it for the interesting tidbits and conversation pieces.y society.

B000JLTRKE|1.0|Oliver Stone being an iconic director, I figured this will be a winner. How wrong could I have been. pretty much the whole film revolves around the rescue of a couple of firemen AFTER the collapse of the towers.     I actually think it insults the firemen that died that day. When you watch real footage of the whole tragedy, police and rescue workers are panicking, running around with equipment to help the injured. Not in this film. They seem rather content, and when walking through the first tower to fetch oxygen tanks, they chat away without a care in the world ie. What you having for tea tonight? And, when they realise the tower is collapsing, they stand still for about 20 seocnds before making way for the rubble. Come on Oliver! What a mess.     The script is terrible. Thats all that has to be said.    As for the highlight of the movie? The shot of the first plane hitting the tower is shown threw a shadow of it upon the streets below. It last for 3 seconds in all. Wow. Oliver stone is a genius.    WATCH UNITED 93. Its much more heart pounding then this caper.
1400136652|5.0|Not all books are better on audio, but I think this one may well be. I don't have the info in front of me at the moment to give proper kudos to the fine narrator, but his fabulous reading of the material gave it much more dimension and nuance than I could have imagined had I read it myself.  Wonderful accents, each character's voice distinct and easily recognized.  I cannot recommend this audiobook highly enough!  See other reviews if you want info about the storyline, etc.
B001PPF12G|5.0|This is done by record company in an attempt to make money off of a band that left them.  But, there are a TON of hard to find b-sides in all of the sets that are worth the money to a true fan of the band.  Hence, I am choking down sending the record company any more money.
B00001OH1S|4.0|Overall pretty decent soundtrack. It is unfortunate as pointed out it is missing Cumenco by Chico Ofarrills Afro Cuban Jazz Orchestra and perhaps one other song. I am happy with what is on it including the long version of Sinnerman by Nina Simone, which is the song used while the men in bowler hats run around the art museum.  A shorter version was used in the movie \\"Cellular\\". Several of Bill Conti's songs are a pleasure as well. Certainly a CD, although short, worth owning. Good quality and plenty of replayability.<br /><br />CA Luster
B0019MLVEM|5.0|Some of the songs are downers/sad but they don't detract from the experience. The do sound a lot like The Fray and to a lesser degree Maroon 5, but this album is much more cohesive and with staying power than what those two bands last put out.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|If you are a James Lee Burke fan you already know this movie fell short of the book/Dave Roubicheaux series. But as a fan you will sit through it anyway. ;) I enjoyed seeing the New Iberia familiars and scenery.    The editing seemed off, like it was a bit choppy. The Elrod character was so much better in the book and I know that Sarsgard is a great actor, it's unclear why it didn't work for Elrod, tho. Levon Helm was awesome, James Gammon was a nice surprise and that racoon that played Tripod was the real star. LMAO. Bootsie and Baby Feet were both way off the mark for me.     I will gladly return to my audiobooks now and wait for the next novel in the series.....    Stacey
031606792X|1.0|The first three books were pleasant but the last book was disappointing. I couldn't see romance between Bella and Edward. I just point out few points:  - Vampire can't impregnate woman, Edward is practically dead at age 17.  - Doesn't Edward have 2 medical degrees? Shouldn't he know about pregnancy? The way he freaked out and shocked was unbelievable.  - The baby and everything around that baby (name, irresistible attraction?!, talent of showing movie instead of talking?, growing super fast?, self-control not to suck Charlie dry?)   - Jacob's imprinting on Nessie. Nature thinks that bringing enemies together is best for the species?  - All the little details rest including non-battle and bunch of new characters.  - Author's explanation of pregnancy: incubus --> Edward is NOT demon.  This is fiction and author can set new rule but I want these rules should have been made clear first or good explanations for loopholes.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|I've had the pleasure of seeing the Phantom of the Opera by the original cast at a live performance.  I didn't think the original could be outdone, or in fact that this wonderful musical would ever be produced in a movie format that could be purchased by the public.  I have long awaited for the movie production of Chess, to no avail.  To say that I was surprised when I accidently ran across this DVD in Amazon.com is one hell of an understatement.  I never thought that it would ever happen.  After reading the previous reviews, I knew that I had to have it.<br /><br />I watched the DVD last evening and was totally blown away.  I agree with one other reviewer in that this production is a hundred times better than the stage production, not only because it \\"connects the dots\\" between the musical pieces, but it gives one a real feel of the dynamics of the story.<br /><br />I am going to purchase several more of these DVD's as gifts.  I suppose there are people who do not like this musical.  My father, for one, would have kicked the ends out of his casket if he would of heard this musical.<br /><br />I can't imagine anyone who watches this movie, not being moved to tears.
0312427646|4.0|I thought this was a charming little story. I could sympathize with the Queen when everyone was giving her a hard time about reading, and with her crankiness when she found herself without a book, and with her struggles to find someone to talk about books with (why do you think I'm so happy I've found a great book club?). And the twist at the end is the cherry on the sundae.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|Coldplay's Viva La Vida is a great release, and this EP is overall a very good expansion of that album. The new version of Life in Technicolor with lyrics is different yet adds a lot to the song. Tracks 2-5 are almost entirely new material, most of it exceptional, especially Glass of Water. However, 6, Lost with Jay Z is ridiculous. Silly. Keep Jay Z far away from Coldplay as possible. The remix of Lovers in Japan is unnecessary as well, as it is so similar. At least it's unoffensive. The last track is original and worth it as well.    This EP is worth buying for the new material, and if you are a Coldplay collector, the other versions of Lost and Lovers in Japan may interest you as well. Now to delete that horrid Lost + track...
1416500294|5.0|I was an adult before I read this book. I am so glad I decided to try it out. It is an adventure in the truest sense. I have yet to see a movie do any justice to this book.

B0013FXWU6|1.0|First the only good thing about this film is Lewis acting. He's one hell of an actor.  After that, the story is so boring that I had to fast forward many times just to move it along.  It's a very dark account about a man who has no redeeming values and shouldn't be shown on film.  What a waste to see a great actor get lost in this terrible story.

0321344758|5.0|This book should be required reading for anyone who is planning to build a web site, as a professional or weekend warrior.

0887307280|4.0|Being in the web business I assumed e-myth had something to do with e-commerce or something web based.<br /><br />When I learned that the \\"e\\" stood for \\"entrepreneur\\" I had an \\"ah ha\\" moment.<br /><br />For several years I struggled with how to evolve from free lancer or hobbist to company.  The key, it turns out, was creating systems and a structure that would ultimately allow my company to run itself.<br /><br />This is not a \\"how-to\\" book, but more of a fable with concreate examples to emmulate.  However, Michael Gerber clearly illustrates the mistakes small businesses make and how to avoid them.  It's a delighful and page-turning read.<br /><br />The E-Myth Revisited has helped me tremendously.  I now keep several copies on hand and give them as \\"thank yous\\" to new clients, who could use a little extra guidance.  The more they know about how to run their business, and can translate their brand to me, the more effective their web site will be in helping to growing their business.
1416914307|3.0|Before I start critiquing, I want to say that I enjoyed this book. I was pretty much glued to it for a day, so it is a page turner. I did have problems with it that prevent me from giving it a higher rating though.<br /><br />Clare was very repetitive, which I partly attribute to bad editing. I got very annoyed with Clary and Jace because of it. One scene of over angst-y declarations of love would have been quite enough, but I lost count of how many were actually in this book. It was hard for me to believe that two people who have only known each other a month could be so deeply in love. It was more like physical attraction mixed with infatuation. I started disliking Clary's character more than ever because of her rash decisions. She always got herself into trouble and had to be rescued. It's a problem when the main characters of your story are annoying.<br /><br />There was no surprise factor for me because I figured out the \\"twist\\" before it was revealed and the ending was just as predictable. But what really ticked me off was one particular death that was absolutely unnecessary. It made me angry that Clare chose this person to die when she could have easily picked someone else less like-able.<br /><br />I don't know if I'm being too hard on this book. I guess I expected more and it's frustrating because it could have been a lot better with a bit of tweaking. I would have liked the ending to be less happily ever after and just a little tragic. I may not agree with Clare's decisions, but parts of the story were great and that redeemed it a bit for me.
0066620996|5.0|This book is a must-read for executives charged with building success and fascinating for anyone interested in business in general.

Its certainly in my top ten list of business books.
B000000IRG|5.0|The CD just came today! -- and I listened to it from beginning to end.  I LOVE IT! -- especially track no. 1, \\"Funeral for a Friend / Love Lies Bleeding\\".  But, I have to say, I love all 17 of them!  I thought it would be another opportunity to preserve my childhood / early adolescence memories in Gold! -- for instance, listening to the 8-track cartridge upstairs in my Mom's bedroom -- I just loved the San Francisco view!<br /><br />The first track was my favorite from the outset -- the music is somewhat depressing at first, but then it quickly picks up!  I then came to like them all -- until the tape quit playing altogether.  :-(  I later got a tape recorder and the cassette for my 14th birthday in 1975, among other things.<br /><br />Great memories and music, literally in 24K Gold!  I tell you -- NOTHING makes you feel as good as GOLD!  o:-)  !!!

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Review of Albert Broccoli's Eon Productions \\"Casino Royale:\\"<br /><br />As a dedicated fan of the entire James Bond franchise in my humble opinion Casino Royale is the finest Bond film made to date.  Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is fresh and realistic as shown through a gritty and hard facet.<br /><br />The storyline is not too complicated and again believable setting itself up for the sequel; in this case Quantum of Solace.  In the beginning of Casino Royale Bond's backstory is revealed as to how he attained his \\"00\\" status and reveals \\"flaws\\" in his character.  Bond's initial interaction with Vesper Lynd reveals even more of his background as an orphan,etc.<br /><br />Reminiscent of a young Connery in \\"Dr. No,\\" Craig in Casino Royale delivers the goods.  Well done.  Five stars + with no hesitation or reservation.<br /><br />Jeffrey Peter Hauck

B001DCQI9G|5.0|Herbert von Karajan was an outstanding conductor of the early to mid period Romantic repertoire, although the notable exceptions are his readings of Richard Strauss and Bruckner, which I consider some of his better performances. It is, however, his Beethoven and Mendelssohn that I find most satisfying.<br /><br />There are many things I find great with his Mendelssohn. First of all, he doesn't treat him like another Classical Era wannabe like Claudio Abbado does, who I consider one of the worst conductors I've heard, and secondly, Karajan's readings project majesty and the pure essence of beauty. Mendelssohn was not a particularly \\"dark\\" composer. His works, in particular, his symphonies, are light on their feet, but they have this regal, romantic, brightness to them that is really hard to put into words. His music is instantly accessible and that is perhaps why he is so well known.<br /><br />In this 3-CD set released on Deutsche Grammophon, we get all classic performances with Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic, which are obviously one of the best orchestras in the world. I find all of these interpretations satisfactory, but I especially enjoyed Symphonies No. 2, 3, & 4 to be outstanding.<br /><br />This set is obviously a symphony set, but I wished they included Karajan's account of \\"The Hebrides (Fingal's Cave),\\" but that's a small gripe for this collection.<br /><br />If you're new to Mendelssohn or a collector of his works, then this is a fine addition to your collection. Highly recommended.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|One of my biggest issue with the Playstation 3, is the controller. The biggest issue with the controller for me is the triggers. I frequently accidentally press the trigger either from my fingers resting on the trigger or it slipping. This is due to the inward curvature of the triggers.     The RealTriggers solves this problem and is well built. However, it is slightly bigger than I expected and causes a slightly longer reaction time due to the further distance the triggers has to travel for the PS3 to recognize the trigger press.     Pros:  - Solves the accidentally trigger press problem  - Well built and even color on the plastic. Color matches the controller's other buttons  - Easy installation, just snap it on. It takes 2-seconds.   - Removal didn't cause any damage or leave any marks on the controller.  - Works on both the DualShock 3 and the Sixaxis controller    Cons:  - High cost for essentially two pieces of small plastic  - Hard to remove, but possible  - Increases reaction time due to increased trigger travel distance  - Minor point and very subjective, but does not aesthetically look pleasing once installed    Overall I highly recommend this product for those experience the accidental trigger press. It has greatly improved the PS3 controller for me. I will buy a few more for backup in case these are no longer sold else where.    The amazon description suggest this product is from Messiah, but I received the GioTeck ones. Hopefully that clears up the confusion for some.

0312360266|4.0|An interesting take on vampires, not totally new, but not totally and completely done too much either. We find Zoey Redbird leading a fairly ordinary teenage girl life in the beginning of the book. She has friends, a not-so-ex-boyfriend and parent troubles. Then her life is turned upside down when she is \\"marked\\" and thus must attend a special school for vampyre fledglings. I found the vampyres-living among us as a known entity interesting as well as the school.<br /><br />So fast-forward ahead and she's at the school, but not until she has more problems with her parents. Being Christian I actually thought I would have problems with the divide created between organized religion and the vampyres as evidenced by Zoey's mom and stepdad. But I really didn't. The world is honestly full of hypocrites and while I didn't smile at the way her parents were portrayed, it is actually accurate of a lot of religious people (note I said religious which is not always the same as Christian - though I am not one to judge on that either) - scared of what you do not know. So while there are pagan rituals and the like in the book, I saw them as a side theme - something that developed the story and the school better. I don't have to participate in the ritual to read the book. Nor do I have to be a vampyre :)<br /><br />Once that was realized I relaxed and really enjoyed the book. A great coming of age story. Zoey is a likable character and I look forward to watching her grow more through the books. She's not perfect but she tries to think about all her decisions and make the best ones for her and for those around her. Something that not many people do anymore.<br /><br />So after all of that - I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys YA paranormal. It's just a good fiction read. The Cast's have created an interesting world with likeable and not-so-likeable people. It let me escape a few hours and the characters have stayed with me after I finished reading it. So to me that was a worthwhile book and I cannot wait to read the rest of the books in this series.ait to read the rest of the books in this series.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I don't have cable & so had to wait for the DVD of the first season -- It is addictive & delicious like a strawberry vanilla ice cream shake melting into perfection -- Especially great is the superb casting -- January Jones is fantastic as are all the other actors -- not least the lead. Having worked in the sixties for Shell Oil Corp. in the Sperry-Rand building on Sixth & 51st -- where the politics, camraderie, martini lunches, humiliations, & male chauvinism -- marvelously evoked by the writers of 'Mad' -- were in evidence. I spent 18 hours (with breathers for coffee & breakfast) watching all 13 episodes of the first season over the course of an all-nighter -- and tonight I am compelled to re-view the last three episodes. It's like a blend of Delillo's first novel 'Americana', Yates' 'Revolutionary Road', with the decor of 'Desk Set' and the bitter comedy of Billy Wilder's 'The Apartment' (which is referenced in an early episode of 'Mad'), with vintage 'Playboy' ambience thrown in for good measure. These were the last years when women wore petticoats, merry widows, stockings, and suspender belts. The only weakness I could detect was the flimsily produced Korean War sequence illuminating Don Draper's secret origins. As far as I can see that part could have been explained in dialogue -- a la Greek tragedy -- without using the cheesy old M.A.S.H. set. All in all it's the best adult soap I've ever seen. I can only hope the season continues for as long as 'Sopranos'. Lastly kudos for the music composer and the animators that created the opening credits sequence -- it's fabulous -- This HBO product is a work in which every participant should derive a lifetime's worth of pride. Great! And writers: withold, withold, withold the easy character explanations. To quote Don Draper: \\"No one knows why people do things.\\"
B000031WBV|5.0|When I first heard the Moravec disk, my first reaction was like everyone else's - wow! But after repeated listenings, I began to realize that Moravec, while playing absolutely beautifully, was bringing out more than what Chopin put in, with sudden and uncalled for changes in tempo which go far beyond rubato. Rubinsten, by contrast, plays what is there, with tasteful and unobtrusive rubato, and produces music which is just as beautiful, but I think more of what Chopin intended.<br /><br />I have the same issue with Claudio Arrau. Every grace note becomes a quarter note. Both of these fine pianists have somehow become composer as well as pianist, and I don't think this is the way to go about it.<br /><br />Stick with Rubinstein. There's a reason why he is considered by most of us to be the best at Chopin - he plays the music the way it should be played, while producing an unmatched silky smooth sound.
0375424474|5.0|Shubin's _Your Inner Fish_ caught my attention as I was browsing for books on paleobiology.  A paleobiologist at the University of Chicago by training (a Professor of Anatomy by accident), and a co-discoverer of a Devonian link between fish and amphibians, Shubin provides a marvelous introduction to both paleology and evolutionary biology.<br /><br />For those with a strong scientific background, I am sure much of what Shubin covers is old news.  For a non-scientist, the information (and its presentation) was brilliant.  _Your Inner Fish is written in langauge that is easy to understand, demonstrating micobiological developments in layman's terms, and lucidly explaining how paleobiologists (and taxonomists) arrive at the conclusions they do regarding nature's distant ancestors and the vast genetic interconnectedness of life.  As an added bonus, a number of Nobel-Prize winning experiments in biology were discussed, with an explaination to their importance to broader science.<br /><br />As with any scientific book written for the masses, there are bones to be picked.  (No pun intended.)  As a member of the scientifically uninitiated, I was fascinated with his presentation of how paleontologists know where to dig (no, its not just guess-work), and how evolutionary biologists structure their experiments in seeking to learn how (and where) our genetic structure branched out and well, evolved.<br /><br />Highly recommended for arm-chair scientists and those with an interest in (and a lack of training in) paleobiology or evolutionary biology.  Those with previous training or exposure (at 200-level course work or above), I suspect this would be repetitive.

I recommend this book to ages 9+ it is a great adventure. My favorite thing about the book is camp half-blood I would love to go to a cool camp like that!

B00197X140|4.0|As a long time Anathema fan, I've enjoyed seeing them move further from their earlier thrash roots to a more moody, ambient style.  This album takes several of the mellower songs from their albums and sees them done in a more acoustic setting.  They chose very well in the pieces they selected for this mood and it makes for a great ambient album.  One of the best things about their last several releases was the contrast of the ambient with the harder edged songs, so in the end it does make this feel like a bit of a \\"filler\\" album to tide us over until they release their next full on album... which is the reason this gets four stars from me instead of five.
B001GMH8SI|5.0|OK, just gotta say, for all of the stupid futility of his death, Chris still lived MORE than ANY of us. His death was sheer idiocy, but his life, his refusal to accept society on society's terms are brilliantly illustrated in this movie, and REALLLY define his existance, both in the real world and in this adaptation.
1594201927|4.0|The Ascent of Money is well written, providing a broad historical view of how money, civilization, and prosperity have evolved together.  Niall Ferguson is a gifted story teller, which made the book an interesting read.  My one criticism is that the author provides a very superficial view of current monetary issues with the expectation that the reader will conclude that his detailed analysis of monetary fiascos throughout history is sufficiently anecdotal.   There are some unique characteristics to our current bubble, petrodollars, globalization, and how financial controls have been neutered that he glosses over or avoids.  The contrast in writing style while he dances around current issues is stark.  It is obvious that he understands the subject thoroughly.  Perhaps such candor about our current situation would step on too many toes.  With that one glaring inconsistency, I would still highly recommend this book.
1416562591|4.0|A young Indian artist recently reminisced that after finishing school, he was confronted with just two choices: To be a terrorist or an artist. The artist had also wryly remarked that he had chosen the \\"middle path\\": To terrorize people with his art.     I am not sure if Arvind Adiga was confronted with similar choices, but reading his debut novel can be a rather frightful experience, especially for someone intimate with his milieu. I should know; I currently live in the same city as the protagonist!    Paradoxically, the very same element that makes The White Tiger a rollickingly Good Read mars it from being a Great Read. The best parts of the book are those that are riveted by Adiga's extreme outrage at some of the self-congratulatory and self-righteous aspects of modern Indian culture - especially the North Indian political and cultural milieu which is still feudal for most part. Yes, the Darkness exists; so does the Rooster Coop and you better believe it. However, when a writer internalizes his moral outrage, it can also result in sophomoric outburst, of which plenty of examples can be found in the book.     All said, The White Tiger is a must read, even if it is just to get a glimpse of the \\"Real India\\", well beyond the allure of the Travel Channel and the gloss of the \\"Incredible India\\" marketing campaigns.
B000P0J0AG|1.0|I am a huge fan of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.  I had heard nothing but great reviews about this film.<br /><br />There are so many characters to keep track of and seemingly so many different stories going on aside from the main story that I wish I had a pad and paper to keep track of it all.<br /><br />A seasoned criminal who becomes lonely and tries to find love.  A cop who can't devote enough time to his wife as she would like.  A recently released ex-con who doesn't like his job at a diner.  That ex-con's woman who tries to keep him motivated.  A daughter who has a hissy-fit because she can't find a pair of hair clippers that match her outfit.  The list goes on and on.  Too many side stories that pointlessly make this film an hour or more longer then it needed to be.<br /><br />A classic example of how an all-star cast does not guarantee an all-star film.

B000WCBMA8|5.0|Every time I put on a Hives album I just want to scream out and start dancing around like an idiot. Theyre music is so explosive, so fun, so great, and it never gets old.

I love these guys and if I ever need to get pumped up for the day, I throw on the Hives...

B001R4MEYI|2.0|I have been listening to Mastodon since Remission came out and  I loved the first two albums. When they released Blood Mountain, I didn't know what to think. It was obvious that they were taking a turn toward their more progressive leanings and that they were ditching some of their heaviness. The change in sound didn't sit well with me. With this album, they take the prog elements even further.     Gone are the heavy, churning monolithic riffs and that signature Mastodon sound. Instead, we get a bunch of parts that go basically nowhere. There are some good ideas on this album, but the execution is lacking. The songs sound forced and drag along. Another thing is that these songs don't sound like they were written for a live environment. The vocals sound doctored and the music is just too bland. The riffs are boring and every time they pick up steam, they throw in some random part that sounds out of place    Some people might find this album interesting or creative. To me, it just sounds like a band trying to hard.
B000CNESU8|5.0|Network is a classic movie about television and ratings and how the news media stopped producing news and only tv ratings.    Howard Beale is a TV anchor for UBS and has been a staple of the network for years. But when his ratings started dropping, and his wife passing away, Beale becomes more of a distant person.    He's fired for low ratings and his best friend, Max Schumacher notifies him that he has 2 weeks left. They go drinking and at the bar, Howard tells Max that he's going to kill himself on TV...Max responds that if that happened, there would be a 50 share rating.    So the next day, Howard comes out on the air and tells everyone that he will be retiring in 2 weeks because of low ratings and plans on killing himself because he no longer has anything to live for (wife died and no more tv anchor job) and tells the audience to tune in next week.    This causes a complete mess in the executive offices and phone calls start rolling in, ratings immediately jump and the story is covered on the front page of the New York Times. Real news or sensationalism?    Beale becomes a sensation and is even awarded his own primetime show where he rants about being mad, and his catch phrase, \\"i'm mad as hell and i'm not going to take it anymore!\\"    After convincing management that he is crazy, he is allowed to appear on television again, and he starts by apologizing before again, going into a \\"mad as hell\\" tirade.    The managers and directors become entrenched with the ratings after at first, being outraged by Beale's foul language sermons, and in particular, Faye Dunaway's character is only interested in ratings, even giving up her personal life to devote to ratings.    In the end, like all things, his show starts to sag and his ratings start to drop, so as usual, the producers and managers have to come up with fresh ideas and they do.    They..........    can't give it away.    check out the movie, great flick.

B001PPGAIK|5.0|When I saw the write ups for Australia movie with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman, I wanted to get the Blu Ray DVD as soon as I could.  I did not want to rely on Netflix.  I know if I order it threw Amazon with Prime Shipping I will get the best deal (price) and as soon as it is available. I notice Amazon prices are usually lower than say Wal-Mart.       The movie 3 hours is fantastic.  So well made and so interesting and probably realistic for when it was to happen around beginning of WWII.  Had no idea Australia was hit harder than Pearl Harbor probably because closer to Japan.  Both Nicole and Hugh were excellent.  It is somewhat like a cowboy western explained in the extra information available with the movie.  I think everyone will enjoy this movie and good deal threw Amazon.
0143039482|4.0|The Hawley family is \\"Discontent\\". Ethan Hawley is working as a grocery clerk in the store he previously owned. The store now belongs to Marullo, an Italian immigrant who tries to teach Ethan what makes a successful businessman. Even Mr. Baker, the banker, has advice for Ethan: he tries to teach him how to be a good investor. It seems that everyone has an opinion on how Ethan Hawley can bring respect back to his family name. His wife is restless and doesn't like the fact that they are poor and living in a town where they were once respected. Ethan's son wants to go on television and get rich quick, his adolescent daughter is too secretive for his liking.<br /><br />Steinbeck's protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, is a moral individual who has always done the right thing. This novel is set in New Baytown, a fictitious town near Long Island, a town that operates within a realm of corruption. Yet things have operated that way for so long that no one remembers that it is corrupt anymore. Ethan's family feels that he is too ethical for his own good. He has to choose between his current morals and adapting the definition of his morality.<br /><br />Steinbeck captures a nation that is growing economically but bankrupt morally. Where this novel differs from other fall from grace novels is that the central character observes himself as a third party and slides down the slippery slope knowing full well the consequences. Steinbeck offers redemption in the form or Marullo, on being deported he gives the grocery store to Ethan Hawley. This happens just when Ethan is about to rob the bank.<br /><br />A short novel worthy of praise addresses moral questions that really make you stop and think; the dialogue is brilliant.The characters are clever and witty, but at times I found the plot was very slow.
B0013TPVXS|5.0|I consider Robin Hobb to be the best fantasy writer going. Her characters are so interesting and complex-- even though maddening and obtuse at times. I come away from a Hobb book feeling as if I lived a life in her world. And I want to go back.    With the second book of Mistborn, I think Sanderson has equalled Hobb. His main characters live interesting emotional lives. They struggle with ethics and self-worth. They live examined lives, and yet they take action, too.    I must say, usually I roll my eyes at female warrior characters. Too often they are written as indistinguishable from men. They might as well *be* men, but one gets the sense that the author has got some sort of literary affirmative action program going (witness George R.R. Martin's inexplicably no-magic-or-anything unbeatable female knight in his Song of Ice and Fire. Give me a break.) I'm old school. I prefer to read about women who nurture and knights who fight over them. Do you find my attitude annoying you oh-so-modern enlightened reader you? Then I have two things to say A) screw you, and B) listen, Sanderson's female assassin, Vin, won me over. She makes sense. She's a warrior, and a believable (at least to me) young woman. Yes, this is me talking.    I want to be on Vin's team. I want to fly her banner. That takes some sensitive and solid writing, pal. So, this is the best thing I've read since since I ran out of Hobb books (get writing Robin!).    (Also, FYI, I read both books on my Kindle. It was very comfortable. I'm going to read all fiction on my Kindle from now on.)
B001N18HOQ|1.0|I bought the Super DeLuxe Edition Box-set and the Legacy Edition CD. I originally bought \\"Ten\\" the day it came out in 1991. It's been one of my all-time favorite records ever since. Pearl Jam released many great songs after this but no collection quite as grand. I've always been in the fan club and I seen them perform at least 10 times. I've been proud when they succeeded and supportive when they went up against the man, but I can not follow them down this path. Eighteen years after the initial release there is no good reason to try and make these classic songs sound better. It's a weakness that all successful bands face but the very best avoid. As an artist I understand the urge but as a fan I'm let down and slightly offended. Please do not do this with the rest of your catalog. Look at your peers, this kinda thing always ends bad. This will be the last re-mixed CD I buy from you but I'll try to forgive.
B000WS4QJG|1.0|I grew up listening to mostly rock and 1970s fusion jazz but this is one of my favorites MJ cd's, I used too thought jackson was crappy as a little boy, I only knew of songs like Beat it, because in 1986-87 cartoon they used too play alot of 1980s songs on the show called KIDD VIDEO where they have characters like Kid, Wizz, Ash, Carla and Tool Bot, bad guys are Copy Cats and Master Blaster, where the cartoon takes place in Flipside.<br /><br />Anyway I'm in mid 30s today and I enjoy listening to almost anything, from old skool jazz, rock and techno, trance music.<br /><br />Apparently Michael Jackson is more popular after his death, but who cares, call me corny but I think he is a good singer, NOT like hip hop and other pop singers.<br /><br />He does the whole singing thing himself, Like when it comes to Jazz, their not generic either, it takes some practice for Miles Davis to blow on the trumpet.<br /><br />I enjoy all of his songs and back as a little kid IK only knew of beat it, etc. one of my parents told me that Michael Jackson isn't as you think as it is, because most of it is love songs.<br /><br />Youtube kidd video, the episode called Old Tyme that rocks and rolls also has Master Blaster singing one of the Joan Jett songs called I love rock n roll.
0307388921|4.0|Once again, I'm more than pleased with a Palahniuk novel :o) It does not cease to amaze me that he can write like people think--imperfect grammar, choppy and/or run-on sentences, etc.--and not only get published, but put out bestseller after bestseller. I certainly appreciate his style of writing for being so human and not pretentious at all.<br /><br />This one still wasn't quite as good as Lullaby, but I liked it a good deal more than Invisible Monsters. I was thankful that while it did include some of those Palahniuk plot twists at the end, they weren't as ridiculously unbelievable as the ones in Invisible Monsters. Of course, they also weren't as well-written as the ones in Lullaby. That said, this book is, like Invisible Monsters, not for the faint of heart. Although not quite as gory as that novel, the sex scenes in this one are a bit over-the-top. Still, I couldn't put it down, so I'm going to go ahead and rate it 4 out of 5 stars.

I would even suggest you if you know the tip, and know why, still -- read the explanation, as you may find something interesting and something you didn't know. Awesome book!
B001C08RHA|1.0|This is basically 'Robocop' updated to 2008. Except it's nowhere as good as that film. The '87 thriller is set in the future with an equally implausible scenario, but far more intruiging: the body of a murdered police officer is used to create a robot who still retains traces of the dead man's memories. The core of Iron Man is plain silly: set in the present time, the iron man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) must prance around with some kind of magnet implanted in his chest cavity, preventing shrapnel from puncturing his heart. Then, he invents an iron suit which enables him to fly at supersonic speeds and kill terrorists without suffering serious injury. Like Robocop, a computer interface is suggested inside the 'mask' of both superheroes; but in Robocop the hero is haunted by the memories of the dead man whose body was used to create him.<br /><br />There is no such internal tension in Iron Man. It's strictly a good guy-bad guy shoot 'em up. Downey plays Stark, the head of a large corporation which manufactures weapons. Stark is depicted as an arrogant playboy who takes no precautions when he travels around in a Humvee in Afghanistan. He ends up being captured by a local warlord and his crew of motley insurgents and realizes that they have been using his company's weapons to fight US troops. Now he suddenly has a change of heart and uses his skills (he's a genius!) to create an iron man outfit to escape the bad guys (they think he's working on a missile).<br /><br />When he returns to the US, he decides to utilize the prototype of the iron man outfit he created in Afghanistan to become a superhero fighting for good. A good part of the film is taken up with Downey designing the new Iron Man outfit; during the 'testing phase' he gets thrown against the walls of his laboratory numerous times (how exciting!). Finally, he starts flying through the air with this metal suit on and almost crashes when he goes too high up in the atmosphere and his suit gets frozen with ice (funny how he wasn't smart enough to invent some kind of deicing device contained on most commercial aircrafts).<br /><br />Terrence Howard (of 'Hustle & Flow' fame) isn't doing much hustling and flowing here in a do-nothing part as an army liaison officer for the munitions company. Similarly Gwyneth Paltrow, Stark's personal assistant, engages in a great deal of pointless banter leading to a non-romantic moment at the film's denouement. Jeff Bridges probably has the best part as Downey's partner in the multinational corporation who ends up betraying him and working with the warlords and terrorists in Afghanistan. But how did he so easily get past the alarm system or other security devices in Downey's home? You would think that breaking into a home like that wouldn't be so easy.<br /><br />In the end, there is the obligatory battle between the two machines (done much better in Teriminator 2). Bridges looks ridiculous when he takes off his metal helmet and all you see is his face inside the metal contraption. I fail to see why so many critics gave this film good marks. It's strictly a film for uneducated teenagers who read comic books all day. It also serves to lull people in this country into a false sense of security vis-a-vis the terrorist threat. By creating an invincible 'Iron Man\\" who can easily mow down terrorists and bad guys, it makes us forget that the bad guys in real life are not so easily defeated. Case in point: 9/11. The only winners here are the actors who collected nice paychecks for participating in such a cheesy and worthless venture.asn't smart enough to invent some kind of deicing device contained on most commercial aircrafts).

B001SAM1TY|5.0|This is a film that tells it EXACTLY as the film makers see it. The warped visuals say more about its subjects than words ever could. The travelling fair is as twisted and ugly as all travelling fairs seem to be, and the expressionist sets and lighting sum up perfectly the sense of urban alienation in a very unnerving way. It's story is simple enough to be accessible, but don't expect a straightforward film - just let it speak to you.

B0014DFCMS|4.0|Jason Reitman's 2007 film Juno became a audience favorite and the little film that could. Juno penned by Diablo Cody ( who incidently took home the Best Screenplay Oscar) tells the story of a pregnant 16 year old detour into adulthood.    Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a normal teenager who finds herself pregnant and faced with life changing choices. With her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) she sets out to find the perfect adoptive parents for her child. What she finds are the Lorings (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). The Lorings are confronted with their own issues as to what it means to be adults and parents.    The film walks the thin line between comedy and drama quite well. The script is pitch perfect and the acting by the strong ensemble cast is a joy to watch. The film attempts to show individuals as humans not just cardboard cut-outs.    The Blu Ray disc that I viewed presented a crystal clear picture and near perfect sound. The disc also features a ton of extras that enhance the viewing experience. Of especial note are the commentary by Reitman and Cody and the featured deleted scenes. This film was one of the sleepers of 2007 and should not be missed.
B00138EXAQ|5.0|1960 was a banner year for Elvis. Regardless of whether you like the sacred or the secular, [[ASIN:B00157LZBA the gospel album he released that year]] was one of his all-time best, blowing away everything else he did in that genre...and then there was \\"Elvis Is Back\\".<br /><br />Tracks 3 through 14 comprise the original \\"Elvis is Back\\" album. No other (non-greatest-hits) album from the first half of Elvis' career can touch this gem. It's almost as though Colonel Parker told Elvis, \\"this rock and roll stuff is a passing fad, you need to reposition yourself as an 'all-round' entertainer, but you can have one last hurrah before turning out parent-friendly singles and tepid film soundtracks.<br /><br />The only disposable number from the original album is the ponderous ballad \\"Soldier Boy\\", presumably included as a reminder of Elvis' recent stint in the military. (This is not the Shirelles tune of the same name). And sure, Elvis' version of \\"Fever\\" is a little sluggish and overlong. But every other song was firing on every cylinder Elvis had.<br /><br />\\"Such a Night\\"...you won't find a better Elvis song. \\"Make Me Know It\\" is a classic \\"uh-huh-huh\\" Elvis rocker. Leiber-Stoller's \\"Dirty Dirty Feeling\\" is a provocative Coasters-like romp (good heavens, was Elvis really going to chain her to the wall?). The stately ballad \\"Thrill of Your Love\\" has echoes of gospel, and \\"It Feels So Right\\" / \\"Like A Baby\\" / \\"Reconsider Baby\\" all see Elvis squarely in the blues.<br /><br />As far as the tracks added to this album go, most are hits from this same year, 1960. The best of the lot would be \\"A Mess of Blues\\", a b-side that shoulda been an a-side that shoulda been included in this album in place of the ill-fitting \\"Soldier Boy\\".<br /><br />If I had to pare down my Elvis collection to just three CDs, it would be the 1969 triumph [[ASIN:B00138H0Z6 From Elvis In Memphis]] (or its CD approximation [[ASIN:B000002W96 The Memphis Record]]), [[ASIN:B002B0EH60 The Sun Sessions]], and this monster, \\"Elvis Is Back\\".monster, \\"Elvis Is Back\\".
0061122416|2.0|I have never before written a review that is anything other than glowing, since I would much rather promote a book than tear one down. That said, this is probably the only book that has ever come highly recommended to me by which I have been painfully disappointed.<br /><br />I have no problem with simplicity: in fact, I think that is precisely what a lot of modern literature is missing. However, there is a distinct difference between simplicity and such directness as to insult your reader's intelligence. To use such lofty-sounding phrases (really just variations on overused sci-fi/fantasy terms like \\"Destiny\\") as \\"Personal Legend,\\" always capitalized, and always stated instead of demonstrated, is really nothing more than lazy writing. It's a basic rule of fiction: show, don't tell, but you're always being told EXACTLY what you're supposed to take from each episode. Yet, even in spite of the flowery language, one is left with only a very vague sense of the purpose of the story. The characters are soulless, aimless, and dull, and there is absolutely no sense of inertia in the book.<br /><br />In short, The Alchemist is probably the most overrated book to ever grace the Bestseller List.
B0012E2HRC|5.0|Clint Eastwood shows a more sensitive side in The Bridges of Madison Country based on the novel by Robert James Waller, Eastwood walks into romantic territory in a love story I enjoyed even more than The Notebook.    The bulk of the story is told in flash-back as two adult children read their recently deceased mother's journal detailing her love affair with a National Geographic photographer.    Francesca (Meryl Streep) is a bored Italian housewife, whose husband and two children leave home for four days. Within minutes of their departure, she meets Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), on assignment from National Geographic to photograph covered bridges in Iowa. The two are almost immediately drawn in by each other and embark upon a four day love affair.    Eastwood proved, once again and not for the last time, that he's one of the best director's Hollywood has no matter what material he's given. Not only that, he broadens his range as an actor here too. It's hard to doubt Eastwood's skill and emotional range as an actor after Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino but he takes a completely different direction with Kincaid. He's very romantic and charming with a big disarming grin.    Streep scored her 10th Oscar nod with this film and deservedly so. I've never paid much attention to Streep, but she's wonderful here and completely disappears into her role, flawlessly hitting all the right notes.     I can't imagine anyone besides Eastwood and Streep in these roles, they both bring something so vivid to them, it is absolute magic.    For me, the weakest (and really sole weak) sections of \\"Bridges\\" are the scenes involving Francesca's grown children. The acting (especially by the actor playing Michael) is really sub-par.    Overall, in my opinion, The Bridges of Madison County is the quintessential American romance story. It's a timeless story that should appeal to a broad audience, young and old. The story is very beautiful, very moving, and packs a whole lot of emotional poignancy. This is required viewing for anyone wanting a love story with both depth and beauty.    GRADE: A
B00005AQE8|5.0|I couldn't say All Eyez on Me is Pac's number 1 best work but it ranks pretty high with Makaveli,me against the world,and 2pacaplypse now. I still think its a classic. The production on these cds were great but Pac lyrics have became a little bit lazy but he redeems himself on Makaveli. Disc 1 has a whole bunch of classics,the only song I wasn't really feeling was How do u want it.Disc 2 had some fillers like Ratha b ya Nigga or Check out time but was still pretty good. I just wish he had more conscious tracks like he did before he joined death row records.But overall a must get for any Pac fan.
030014332X|5.0|Gombrich takes the reader on a pilgrimage from 'before there were any people' up to the end of World War II.<br /><br />But he does it masterfully, in a style written for young readers - and yay! - we adult readers like it. Simple sentences, easy explanations and wit. Chapter titles like \\"An Unlucky King and Lucky King,\\" and \\"Heroes and their Weapons,\\" wrap it all up in digestable morsels with factual information.<br /><br />What's even better is that it covers more than American and British history, which is most of what we were taught in the U.S. China, Turkey, Africa are all included equally.<br /><br />And yes, while Gombrich illustrates that history *does* repeat itself, he doesn't write the same bland comatose-invoking text over and over. It's fresh in each chapter.<br /><br />[...]
B000001Y16|5.0|I think this is Pac's best album even I think Me against the world could contend with this one though. My favorite song by Pac is \\"So many tears\\" that my main reason I think it could. But back to the main subject, the beat production was Pac's best,even better than All eyez on me. Pac gives us all his emotions on this album. Pac really gets lyrical on this album. This album you can play all the way thru. The only weak tracks were Toss it up and Life of an outlaw but they weren't that bad. To me,this album is just as good as: Illmatic,The Diary,Liquid Swords,Soul on ice,Paid in full,etc. This is a must have for any Pac fans.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|We've watched the series on Discovery. It is thrilling, breathtaking, a master piece. We gave our grandson the set for his birthday, then decided to get a set of our own. Our player won't accommodate HD so we are in the market now for a new one. Can't wait to watch it again. It is truly awesome and spectacular.
0525951113|3.0|I read about 10% of the reviews out there before I bought this book.  Even at the midway point, I was questioning those who chimed in negatively, but, as the pages started to run out, I had to agree that it's all downhill after the midway point.  The last 1/3 or so of the book crosses from engrossing to absurd. The body count escalates without advancing the plot for several chapters.  The big twist at the end is predictable and self serving.  Of course the author intends to profit from the sequel.<br /><br />This was my first techno-thriller and I admit that it was quite engaging for quite a while.  Whether or not I'd invest in Freedom (the sequel supposedly coming out in 2010), will depend on reviews available then.<br /><br />To those who are considering buying this book, I'd suggest waiting a year to see if the reviews indicate that the Freedom provides closure to Daemon.  If not, save yourself the expense of both books.
0440244870|5.0|I loved this book! I have not seen the movie that just came out but I can't imagine it will be better than the book. I found myself unable to put it down. After reading this one, I had to order Shopaholic Takes Manhattan and Shopaholic Ties the Knot. For anyone wanting a feel good, amusing read, pick this one up.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|When Amazon sells something directly, you get it on time if not earlier. I originally placed the order with one of their advertised Marketplace vendors who advertised 3-4 days. the order acknowledgement indicated devlivery within 3 weeks (via USPS). I immediately cancelled that order and ordered from Amazon. Got it in 3 days.
B000EXZI0A|5.0|This is a first class \\"greatest hits\\" cd by the Ramones. It contains 20 great songs. Some of the Highlights I liked include: \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\", \\"Beat on the Brat (with a baseball bat)\\", \\"Sheena is a Punk Rocker\\", \\"Rockaway Beach\\" (which is a real beach in New York), THE CLASSIC - \\"I WANT TO BE SEDATED\\", and the \\"KKK Took My Baby Away\\". This greatest hits CD would make a great addition to any Rock & Roll Music collection, and therefore, I recommend it. Afterall, the Ramones are inductees into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. They have this \\"huge\\" guitar on display there that has the Ramones \\"Logo\\" on it. Thanks!!!!!
B00007KWHG|5.0|The only problem with this purchase is that this is the second time that I have been asked to review it.  As with the first time, the CD was just as represented and arrived in a timely fashion in good condition.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  Just don't ask me about it again.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|CLOVERFIELD<br /><br />**** ½ Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- January 18th, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 84-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- PG-13<br /><br />Screenplay- Drew Goddard<br /><br />Director- Matt Reeves<br /><br />Starring- Michael Stahl-David, Odette Yustman, T.J. Miller, Jessica Lucas, Lizzy Caplan, Mike Vogel<br /><br />Cloverfield is a prime example how ratings don't mean anything when it comes to crafting a well made and suspenseful movie. There's a lot of backlash on PG-13 horror flicks and how they suck and while some movies do need an R-rating a horror film can still be effective with a PG-13 rating. Many of my favorite horror films are from the 30s and if released now would only get a PG rating and they are some of the most chilling horror films of all time. The problem these days with PG-13 is they are poorly made and well I can name plenty of poorly made R-rated films. I love splatter flicks and I love seeing hot women naked as well, but you really don't need either to make a great horror movie and Cloverfield is proof of that.<br /><br />I avoided this movie for the longest time and finally gave in and watched it and I didn't expect much of anything out of it, but what I got was one of the best horror films of 2008. There was a lot of hype surrounding Cloverfield and this is one of the few times the hype was legit. Cloverfield is a well crafted and even creepy movie at times and due to the hype there is bound to be a backlash and there is bound to be hate since it's cool to hate anything that makes it big.<br /><br />In 2008 the hand held camera style of filmmaking made a big comeback it was first made famous by The Blair Witch Project (though it owes a bit to Cannibal Holocaust). 2008 saw the theatrical release of George Romero's Diary of the Dead, Quarantine (remake of REC) and of course Cloverfield. I personally didn't like the way it was used in Blair Witch, but if used right it can be really effective and the movies that used in 2008 it worked well and Cloverfield might be the most effective in terms of the hand held camera. The one thing I hate is the shaky cam unless used right and most of the time it isn't. But here in Cloverfield it worked really well and added to the confusion the characters were feeling and the hand held camera adds a bit of realism to the movie.<br /><br />The screenplay by Drew Goddard was well written and the characters are interesting and even likeable. Running at only 84-minutes and the action starts off pretty quickly there's not a lot of time to develop the characters, but due to the way the movie was done it actually works to the advantage of the movie. Due to the way the movie was done giving a lot of depth to the characters wouldn't have worked I think the fact only the first act did a little bit of development worked well here and the characters benefit from not being too developed.<br /><br />Director Matt Reeves does a fantastic job with Cloverfield; the movie only runs at 84-minutes (less with closing credits) and by around the 15-minute mark is when things start to happen and I thought for sure Cloverfield would run out of steam, but to my surprise it never did. Reeves, also manages to create some really great tense moments and is able to sustain it for pretty much the whole movie. The scenes in the subway are highly effective and are actually fairly creepy. There was a moment or two when it felt like Cloverfield was about to run out of steam, but Matt Reeves is able to again elevate the suspense and tension.<br /><br />Some of the scariest scenes happen early in the movie as there are explosions and there's this sense of panic and confusion, which is bound to remind people of 9/11. Living in New York and seeing these scenes really made me think back to that. Seeing people running as a cloud of dust is heading towards them and people take shelter in a store is very reminiscent of 9/11, which I suppose was some of the influence on Cloverfield. These scenes are bound to strike a chord with those living in New York at the time of the terrorist attack.<br /><br />The performances in Cloverfield are solid and they feel like real people rather than actors playing characters, which is always a good thing. My only complaint is one thing a certain character does at the end of the movie is kind of idiotic, but that's the writing and not the acting, but even with a few scenes like that the actors manage to sell it and make it believable.<br /><br />The only complaint I really have is at the end when we see the monster in the daytime. I personally felt that took a little away from the movie, but besides that Cloverfield was surprisingly excellent and in my opinion one of the very best horror movies of 2008.rmances in Cloverfield are solid and they feel like real people rather than actors playing characters, which is always a good thing.

B001NE80P4|5.0|I bought this because I loved High School Musical 1.    Just for some extra info, I HATED HSM2.     Anyway, the movie is good. Not as good as HSM1 by far, but it's still better than HSM2. There are still plenty of lame dancing and singing and ridiculous plot devices for you to make fun of and laugh at.
B001993Y2C|5.0|From the first frakin scene, BSG has provided us with a consistently interesting, well written, superbly acted, and thought provoking Sci Fi TV Show.  Yes, the Battlestar was a huge spaceship however, as a Veteran of the US Navy, I can tell you that every time we were treated to shots inside the Gallactica, I was reminded of my old ship.  I know from listening to interviews, this was what the producers wanted.  They wanted Gallactica to resemble an Aircraft Carrier, in space.  They succeeded.      The writing, was always top notch, as the team on BSG produced one terrific show after another.  I grew to care about the characters.  As I watched the series, I grew more and more interested in the plight of  the last of humanity.  The series began with just under 50000 humans as they searched the galaxy for their new home world.  All the while, they were running from the Cylons.  Cylons were robots built by humans who turned on their masters.  Some resembled walking \\"Toasters\\", and others were nearly perfect copies of human beings.  This group of models were known as \\"Skin-Jobs\\".  A couple of them even looked like cat walking models......  Earth was a planet written about in their scriptures.  Religion was based upon Greek Gods and Goddesses, making this portion a lot of fun for those of us who enjoy the mythology of the past.      Unlike other shows I have seen to their end, BSG left many unanswered plot twists and questions.  This will allow for specials, movies and other BSG dramas as the years fly by.      I am looking forward to buying the final 1/2 season once it's released on DVD. After all, I own seasons 1-4 and REALLY enjoy re-watching the shows.  This is a major point to be considered.  Not every show is written so we actually enjoy seeing it several times, BSG is not one of these.      If this is the first time you will be watching BSG, buying the DVD is a great way to get to know this show.  In fact, it's how I first became acquainted with this show.  I was told about the show by a friend at work, so I bought the first and second seasons in order to ascertain my interest in the show, as I had never watched it on TV.      From the first few minutes watching the DVDs, I was hooked!  I've since purchased every season, and enjoy them still.    If you have even a passing interest in Sci Fi, BSG will rock your world.  Take the plunge!  Learn all about Cylons, Capricans, knuckle-draggers, skin-jobs and Viper Jocks.  I promise you, this is the BEST Frakin show to date and well worth the money.
B00005ASGG|4.0|I will admit first and foremost that I am not a huge fan of the Western.  I know, 2007 brought it back, and three of my favorite films that year were Westerns, but as a general rule they just don't really excite me too much.  Still, I wanted to see this movie since I've recently become a little intrigued at the man that is James Stewart.  I loved `It's a Wonderful Life' and felt that `Anatomy of a Murder' was very well done and so as an actor I wanted to see more of his work.  Besides that, a friend of mine ranted and raved this as his favorite Western of all time.<br /><br />So I gave it a shot.<br /><br />I'll say this; `The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' has a lot going for it.  It has a very tightly woven script that is both intriguing and engaging.  It has the right amount of suspense, romance and even political statements that make it feel weightier than your average genre film.  It also has some beautiful cinematography and delicately handled direction that fleshes out the scenes in a very generous light.  It sports a very energetic as well as commanding performance by James Stewart and features a slew of memorable supporting performances, most notably from Lee Marvin and Edmond O'Brien.<br /><br />But, it also has a sore spot.<br /><br />I know that I am going to get a lot of flak for this, but I find John Wayne to be a total conundrum.  I mean, really, how is this guy considered a good actor?  His delivery is strained, he's not very attractive, and while he puts on this front of being that `tough, macho guy' he looks rather ridiculous in the process.  I know this is not the popular opinion, but seriously, I can't stand him.<br /><br />Sadly, he is the noticeable blotch on an otherwise stellar film.<br /><br />The film revolves around a small town that is oppressed by a thug known as Liberty Valance.  The town is practically scared stiff of the man, all except Tom Doniphon.  The town is met with a strange proposition when young lawyer, Ransom Stoddard, stumbles into their town after a near fatal meeting with Valance.  He proposes statehood, instituting law into the town, which would cause conflict with Valance.  In the meantime he clashes with Tom, who is opposed to Ransom's ideas mostly because they conflict with the way he has grown accustomed; and when you add to that the fact that Ransom is getting cozy with Hallie, Tom's crush; well you can imagine the tensions.<br /><br />Stewart is engaging throughout, and Lee Marvin is effectively skin-crawling as Valance.  I really liked Edmond O'Brien's take on newspaperman Dutton Peabody, the local drunk.  He was funny and poignant at the same time; truly unforgettable.  Vera Miles isn't given a lot to do, but she does very little very well.  You know how I feel about Wayne, so I won't say anymore on that subject.<br /><br />The movie is very good, and I recommend it to anyone fond of the genre, the actors or just looking for a pleasantly told story, complete with fully embraced characters and the right touches of drama and action.  The movie is thoroughly enjoyable, despite my disliking of the films big name.with Valance.  He proposes statehood, instituting law into the town, which would cause conflict with Valance.

2266083082|5.0|Excellent book. I wish the rest of the volumes from the same publisher were available. But if you want all of Les Miserables in French from Amazon you have to mix and match the publishers. I also wish Amazon would sell a complete Les Miserables in hardcover, leather bound.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Ergonomically and functionality the G13 is well designed for the gamer. The G13 gives you an impressive array of options and feels built for long-term use. This game board gives you one hand access to 22 of programmable keys on the main board, two mouse style buttons and a programmable joystick that comfortable can be worked by your thumb. Above the keypad are buttons that allow you to switch between profiles changing the function of your whole board. So in essence you have the ability to have up to eighty-seven macros on the G13 and it is very comfortable to use.     The LED display allows you to choose what is displayed, its color and its brightness and they can be changed in real time. When you plug it in and turn on your computer the G13 lights up but you do have a button that also lets you decide if you wish the LED's on or off. This LED panel is designed to show you your monitors performance, CPU and RAM usage, monitor your e-mail, see what songs your playing, accept an RSS fee, a clock and calendar as well as a timer or stop watch. And of course the ability I use and enjoy the most is its ability to provide game information for games it is compatible with. One more things, all the keys are backlit as well.    I play World of Warcraft and the Logitech G13 comes preprogrammed with a set of keys that seem to work adequately for a character with a pet class. It will take some getting use to the configuration that is why I waited so long to write my review. It is nice too have your character stats on the Led if you wish, but I still use my screen for those functions.    This is the only game I play so I cannot speak to how the G13 works on others. But I can run absolutely any macro from it I want without a problem. You actually have to be careful, for the G13 will accept more complex macros then the game macros can and Blizzard does not want anyone using those extra abilities and have stated so.    It took me over a week to get use to the layout but it seems to give you a better reaction time then using the mouse on the screen for casting spells or pet commands. The only problem I have with it is that I tried t get the joystick to replace my mouse for movement and I cannot get my characters to turn. They sort of just run sideways or sidestep which is not convenient at all plus it is very sensitive to the slightest movement. It would have been nice if the joystick had that flexibility, but it may be great for strafing in firsts person games.    The software installs itself off the CD and takes you through a quick tour of the device. All in all I say Logitech is trying to corner the gaming market and I for one am pleased with their equipment. This experience has made me want to try the G19 now. If you play MMORPH games I think you will definitely get your monies worth out of this device.
045122499X|1.0|This book was good to begin with and then went downhill from there.  There were lots of twist and turns to the plot, but very little depth to the characters. I was totally bored with this about 3/4 of the way thru the book, and ended up tossing it out.  The writing style also seemed to suffer as the book went on, almost like the author was also bored with writing it.  Also too much sex - really did nothing to enhance the plot.
B001FBSMF8|2.0|I'll start with a disclaimer - I utterly loathe the style of music that permeates throughout this album. Looking at this for what it is - a style I hate, over synthed, and drum-machined to death, it's some of the best music of that genre that I've endured - instead of gnawing my own legs off in an attempt to escape this musical equivalent of a bear trap, I merely found myself quelling a slight bout of nausea. I knew it would be a trial to my senses when I bought it and so I guess I wasn't overly disappointed.    Anyway, if hip-hop and/or pop are your things, you'll probably like this. If you don't, it's not for you.    That being said, there is a true gem in the \\"hidden track\\" and it allows me to hope for the future. I've always thought that the blues were a perfect fit for Chris (When I'm Down, Limo Wreck, #1 Zero, etc) and this track is on par with those tracks - I'll even make the bold claim that I like it as much as \\"When I'm Down\\" (my favorite Cornell solo song)... I only wish I hadn't needed to subject myself to the rest of the album to find it.
0743496736|5.0|I had never read anything by this author before, but I heard good things about this book so I borrowed a copy from my 17 year-old niece.    It was very well written with fully-formed characters and a compelling story.  The author's use of varying time frames, bouncing back and forth from events preceding and following the central action, was quite effective whereas it could easily have been distracting.  There was a major plot twist at the end of the story which was completely unexpected and yet totally valid and significant within the context of the plot.  This is not easy to do but the author pulled it off brilliantly.    If I had any quibbles with this book it was with two graphic descriptions of an underage girl having sex.  However, I admit that I do not read much fiction, especially that aimed at a younger audience, so I am not familiar with what is acceptable in this area nowadays.    But quibbles aside, this is a first-rate novel and would be enjoyed by readers over a wide span of ages.  Buy it if you can.  This author deserves the royalties.
0385340990|5.0|What a silly title, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.  I cannot say I discovered this book at random and was somehow drawn to it, as it actually was a required reading for my Book Group.  To my absolute delight I fell in love with this old-fashioned story.  I quickly fell in love with the island and its quaint people.  I came to love the characters--Juliet, Dawsey, even Isola who I can so vividly picture.  Her description of herself is just too wonderful --\\"I do not have a pleasing appearance.  My nose is big...One eyeball skitters up to the top and my hair is wild and will not stay tamped down.\\"  Now there is a character waiting to be met!<br /><br />So often throughout the book I stopped to reflect on the great wisdom reflected by the story's characters.  It didn't matter if I could visualize the German troops landing on Guernsey, plane-load after plane-load of them. Rather it was Eben's most admired part of Shakespeare, \\"The bright day is done, and we are for the dark.\\"  How clearly his words described what life on Guernsey became.  If descriptions such as Eben's doesn't reach to and touch you, consider Amelia's lament:  \\"When my son, Ian, died at El Alamein...visitors offering their condolences, thinking to comfort me, said \\"Life goes on.\\"  What nonsense, I thought, of course it doesn't.  It's death that goes on;  Ian is dead now and will be dead tomorrow and next year and forever.  There's no end to that.\\"<br /><br />I am a book lover and have little patience with those who don't read--for whatever reason.  How marvelous that someone like Eben Ramsey found comfort from reading Shakespeare of all things,  \\"I cannot always make sense of what he says, but it will come.  It seems to me the less he said, the more beauty he made.<br /><br />What a perfectly beautiful experience is The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society!
B001N18HOQ|1.0|I'm not going to buy the CD again, I already own it.  I do want to buy the unplugged DVD, though.  Why should I pay for 2 CD's I don't want just to get the 1 DVD?  Because the record company wants the higher price.  Once the die hards have all bought this 3 disc set, however, the DVD will be released as a single item for $10.99.  On that day, I will buy the DVD!
B000V1MMLI|4.0|I had my doubts before I picked this album up, I was already a fan of System Of A Down and the single \\"Empty Walls\\" sounded too similar to that band's music. I was wrong, the lyrics are great this is a thinking man's music. Serj grooves through track to track with songs about 9/11, perscription drugs, and how money corrupts people. Not only did Serj sing, he also made the music which is filled with more piano and softer instruments than S.O.A.D.'s music contains. The rythim and beats of each song are also very catchy and easy to bob your head to after hearing a few times. So even if your not a fan of S.O.A.D. I would still recommend you sit down and listen to this album.

Maybe a Plastic Jeannie bottle thT OPENS up and has one movie on one aside and the other one on the other side.<br />Of Course the boottle would have hinges so it could open and close.
B001PPLIFU|1.0|The action scenes had a strobe-light effect, so rapid was the cutting.  It was so bad that this movie needs to be redone to reach its full potential.  It's almost not even watchable.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|For all you hardcore metal fans out there, the Lifesblood/Call of the Mastodon material was the heaviest they've done since their inception and they haven't gone back into that territory since.  Their progression into being progressive stoner space metal isn't surprising to me.  If you're expecting to get butchered by metal, that's not going to happen here.    Progressive Metal fans, however, will enjoy this album a whole lot (I know I am!)  Mastodon pulled out all the stops for this one and I'm really, really impressed with the effort.  There's a lot of percussion on the album, the drums are just as driving as ever, the music is intense as always, and I really dig the vocals.  I think Mastodon added a lot of diversity to themselves with this album and I think they should be proud of their effort and vision.     I would say it sounds like the direction they started to take with Blood Mountain but with a lot more attention to detail than they had in that album.  The songs are well crafted, they take a progressive direction without forgetting who the band is, it still sounds like Mastodon (I think they're always going to), but it's far more mysterious sounding than what they've previously done.    I'm hesitant to recommend tracks because I think this is one of those albums that just needs to be listened to from start to finish.  Oblivion was a great opener, with Diviniatons and Quintessence driving the listener further down the core of the album with their fast-style of southern metal.  Once you get to The Czar songs, you start hitting the heart of the album and then find yourself get pulled into the land of space metal songs like Ghost Of Karelia and the title track, Crack the Skye.  The Last Baron starts off there but starts morphing back and forth from that to Mastodon-esque groove metal.    I found this to be a great album.  It could be one the best metal albums of 2009 (if not the best.)  It's also a good metal album to give to people who aren't too familiar withthe genre.  It's aggressive but intelligent and deep at the same time.  I highly recommend it.
0385512058|4.0|Very few (if any) of us have gotten where we are in life solely based on our own effort. We've each gotten some help, advice, guidance or a lucky break from someone else along the way. And that's the core premise of Keith Ferrazzi's book - Never Eat Alone. He states that the key to success professionally and in life, hinge upon on the quality of the positive relationships we have with others. The author cites examples of highly successful people who deftly manage their social and professional networks so that all parties involved mutually benefit from the interactions. This type of approach avoids manipulation and coercion in pursuit of the truly overused \\"win-win\\" cliché/scenario. Soundview likes this book because its based on the premises of intimacy and generosity as well as a genuine willingness to help connect friends with other friends rather than disingenuous glad-handing, which is most often associated with the term \\"networking.\\" Additionally, the book provides specific tips and pointers to stay in touch with your network; handle rejection; engage gatekeepers and promote your personal, individual brand.  Make sure that after you read this book, you share it with a friend because that kind of \\"selfless seeds produce a harvest of success.\\"
B001IPILL6|5.0|I purchased this knife because I wanted an ergonomic survival knife that was both high quality and affordable. I got it delivered to me on a silver platter with this blade. A bolt of excitement will shoot up your spine the moment you grasp the handle and remove the cardboard shipping sheath from it and realize you're holding a tractable survival knife that is thicker than a pry bar. It is a serious hunk of metal at 1/4\\" thick - as thick as a Tom Brown Tracker or a Busse Ash-1 without costing as much as a Playstation 3.     Ethan Becker, the man who designed this knife, is a mountain climber, chef, and survivalist. He designed these same types of blades for the legendary but now defunct Camillus. Ka-bar was wise to ask him on board and he continues his basic approach - bringing people Busse-style ultra-thick high-quality steel fixed blades to those of us who don't want to shell out $450 for a used Ash-1 on Ebay or $275 for a Tom Brown Tracker. The Ka-Bar Becker BK2 Companion is easily in their league.     The Kydex shealth is excellent too - the knife snaps into it without even using the snap on belt and it's much tougher than leather and will not retain moisture. More lanyard holes than you could possibly need too.     I ordered my Becker Companion through Goliath and it came two days ahead of schedule. I cannot emphasize this knife enough. It is the survivalist's survival knife. It is not a short sword or a silly Rambo knife. You can baton through a piece of steel pipe and then go skin a rabbit or fillet fish or whittle an oak spear with this knife if you so choose. I think that sums it up pretty well. Indestructible yet tractable.

B000W91RUG|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is the funniest thing on TV and the first season is hysterical!  We love this DVD collection.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|I love this movie and watch it over and over it is done very well and a great story.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|MGM went all out when it came to picture and sound quality, as both are very good and excellent, respectively. Every Blu-ray title should treat its movie like this!    The exotic and rundown locations were photographed well, and all the shine and the grime come across on this disc. The sound quality actually eclipses the video quality with a lossless audio soundtrack that gets you right in the action and then backs off to let you enjoy the Italian coastline, only to hit you again when the action returns. Well done!    When it comes to deciding whether a release is a purchase candidate or a rental, it comes down to how often I plan to watch the movie and what extra features exist on the disc that would extend my enjoyment of the movie.    Repeat viewings will depend upon your opinion of the movie. I really liked Casino Royale, and Quantum of Solace is an acceptable sequel, but not up to the same level as its predecessor. While I wouldn't mind watching the movie again if guests were interested, I don't see myself sitting down to watch it again for quite a while.    So that brings us to the extras. I'm glad to see two trailers for the movie, in HD and in 5.1 sound. Too many Blu-ray releases omit trailers or present them in stereo only (or shove them into the BD-Live features with limited video and sound quality). The rest of the extras aren't all that interesting, and there isn't a commentary or deleted scene to be found.    This disc also forgoes anything resembling advanced content. No picture-in-picture commentary, no BD-Live functionality. Basically, the extras are high definition versions of what you would expect to see on a DVD release.    Is this disc worth purchasing? That's up to you and priority you place on these aspects. The movie is treated well. If you're a fan and your expectations stop at just the movie, you're set! If you want something more, my guess is we'll see a double-dip special edition in about 18 months or so.

B001N26GFM|4.0|I've read the book upon which this movie is based, and also reviewed it. The book makes for a thoughtful discussion on the Holocaust, though it did have some problems having to do with plot implausibilities. Yet despite all of that, I did think the book added some value to novels dealing with the Holocaust, especially in portraying the story from the 8-year-old German Aryan boy's point of view.<br /><br />Now on to the movie - the story follows the book closely with some adaptations. Set during WW II, 8-year-old German Aryan, Bruno finds his carefree life in Berlin is about to come to an end as his father [David Thelis] has been promoted to the position of Kommandant thus necessitating the family's move to a rural outpost which is nameless. So, Bruno [Asa Butterfield], his 12-year-old sister Gretel [Amber Beattie], mother [Vera Farmiga] and dad make the move. Bruno is initially not impressed with his new surroundings - there are no other houses nearby and the children are not able to attend school, having to be taught by an old tutor who very much subscribes to Nazi ideology, pummeling the children with his ideology of hatred every chance he gets. Young Bruno in the meantime has discovered a 'farm' close by and to his immense delight, meets another 8-year-old boy with the curious name of Schmuel [Jack Scanlon] who seems to have tons of 'friends' and has the luxury of wearing 'pajamas' all day. Though he is forbidden to explore the back of the house, Bruno makes clandestine visits to his friend, who sadly cannot play with him as they are separated by a barbed wire fence, which Bruno thinks is to keep the animals out. The pairs friendship grows every day, and Bruno begins to discover certain things - that Jews are not treated well [he doesn't really buy the \\"Jews are evil\\" idea], and begins to see his father in a different light [the Kommandant keeps silent when a Jewish houseworker is pummeled by a sadistic Nazi underling]. In the meantime, Bruno's mother Ilse [Vera Farmiga] begins to fall apart as she comes to discover what really goes on in the camps [extermination of Jews] and suffers an emotional breakdown. The rest of the story deals with what happens to Bruno and Schmuel and the others.<br /><br />There are some plot implausibilities - the fact that Bruno is so incredibly naive about Jews and the ideology of hatred against them is hard to accept if only because most German Aryan boys of Bruno's age would have been in the Hitler Youth and thus exposed to such teachings. Bruno being a high-ranking Nazi officer's son would most certainly have been in the Hitler Youth as would his sister. Also, Ilse not knowing of what was going on in the camp [extermination] also seems implausible. As for Schmuel, most young children were immediately selected for the gas chambers upon arrival, and it seems almost miraculous that Schmuel survived for as long as he did, and was able to meet Bruno so often without detection.<br /><br />But, implausibilities aside, I still liked this movie - it manages to portray the innocence of children in a depraved world so very credibly, and this is largely due to Asa Butterfield's amazing performance as the naive Bruno whose eyes are slowly 'opened' to the cruelty evident around him. Jack Scanlon's Schmuel is also credible -the chemistry between the two boys is very real, and their friendship is altogether believable, even the part when Bruno 'betrays' his friend and Schmuel's reaction to this. Vera Farmiga's performance as the tormented Ilse is the most powerful adult performance in this movie - she delivers a finely-nuanced performance that makes us believe Ilse was truly horrified by what was being done to the Jews. The other adult male characters delivered rather weak performances - David Thewlis as the Kommandant was stiff in his role and seemed ill at ease for the most part, the sadistic Nazi driver seemed very much a one-dimensional character, and even the Jewish houseworker was not given much character development.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" succeeds in getting under one's skin and doesn't cop out with a happily ever after ending, for the climax is brutal and mind-numbing. The child actors' powerful performances enables the movie to address questions about humanity and man's capacity for evil.cter development.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" succeeds in getting under one's skin and doesn't cop out with a happily ever after ending, for the climax is brutal and mind-numbing.

0061134007|5.0|Actually, Jo Nesbois only the 2nd Norwegin mystery writer I've encoutered, Karin Fossum being the first.  Be that as it may, I am greatly impressed by the atmosphere, the character development, the tragic, the psychological involvement and literary quality of those books I've read.This book was a learning experience as well as a superb entertainment for me.  I hadn't realized the fact that Norway was split during the 2nd world war and that even families were divided between Nazi sympathizers and anti-Nazis.  This book deals educationally and entertainingly with the WWII background.   We also see how this divisiveness influences present day Norway, and I admire how the writer shifts effortlessly between the two time periods.The book while being an engrossing mystery is a notable literary achievement.  I found a seven short chapter sequence in the middle of the book to be one of the most emotionally devstating passages I have ever read.  I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about when you reach that point.Another quite notable aspect of the book is the one thread that remains unresolved at the end and the knowledge that one particular character is undoubtedly going to be in at least one subsequent book.Don't let the book's length deter you from reading it.  You'll hardly notice the length once you get into it
B000AYEL6U|4.0|great movie. so romantic. really sweet story. it is rather sad with several deaths occurring during the course of the movie. that said, the story does not revolve around sadness. very clean too. armatage makes a great main charater as does the actress who play marget. 10 times better than cranford (a movie based on another novel by gaskell).
B001R10BM8|5.0|It might have been the first Bond film. I saw it on a plane and hated it. At home, I enjoyed it more . Michel Legrand's music made more sense and the different Baroque Bond style showed it's charm. The director (The Umpire Srikes Out-kidding; I liked it) said  he hadn't seen the Bond films and gave them a brief glance, so his 'vision' was fresh.  It is; or was and it's fun to see. The BD sound is DD Surround 3.0 and DTS MA 5.1 and the master is an early style' , mild but powerful; which means it's able but not as consistently aggressive nor detailed as modern tracts.  Never Say Never looks and sounds better than ever!

B000PKX2KA|5.0|Tried this unit after I found out the \\"new\\" Garmin eTrex Legend H only outputs proprietary Garmin data (original eTrex Legend will output NMEA data). This makes it useless for software other than Garmin's own overpriced versions. After speaking with the rather rude rep at Garmin, I decided to look elsewhere. I already had and was happy with Streets & Trips and share trip files with friends and family members. I tried another data-conversion software to allow use of the Legend H, but it was simply a hassle. This one hooks up seamlessly and acquires satellites much more quickly than the Legend did. Since I only needed a unit to feed the notebook with S&Ts, this was ideal. It's quite small and has a small suction cup with a cable slot to hold it steady on the dash, if you don't care to use the magnetic back. It uses only a tiny amount of power through the USB port... in fact, I've run it on an old notebook with a PCMCIA USB adapter and Windows 2000 and it works perfectly. The USB cable is longer than the Garmin unit, also.    I ordered a replacement for the original eTrex Legend to use on hikes and to save tracks when not in the truck (still have all the add-ons and adapters for it). The original unit lasted 5 years and the replacement is still that same unit, so it'll work through a serial adapter to USB in a pinch. Too bad Garmin seems to have become so greedy as to force use of its software.    The vendor shipped it quickly and it arrived in perfect condition.

Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman connect well, but it bothers me that Hugh's character only has the name \\"Drover\\" throughout the movie.  Come on!  He has no name?!  The cinematography is excellent, but the storyline is a bit weak and easy to figure out.  On a scale from 1 to 10, I give it a 7-1/2.

To get started.    Started on what, you ask?     Yes! And on how, where, when, why and how much, as well. (You'll have to read it to get it.)    The point is, it really doesn't matter what you draw first. Or how slick it looks. What matters is that you begin, and that you do so with the understanding that \\"the first mark may be the most difficult to make, but it's also among the least important.\\" Why? 'Cause if all goes well you'll be \\"adding to it, altering it, and possibly erasing it entirely.\\"     What you're doing when you put pen to napkin, or marker to white board, is getting the wheels turning: your own wheels, for sure, and usually others' because as Mr. Roam points out, hand-drawn pictures are quick to make, easy to change, and people naturally like looking at them.    The Back of the Napkin teaches you to use your innate ability to \\"think visually\\" to systematically solve problems and make the MOST of drawing - no matter if you see yourself as an artist going in, or not. I'm happy to have it on my shelf.     Thanks to the author for LOOKING, SEEING, IMAGINING, and SHOWING!

0316017922|3.0|The author does a great job at confirming that the two major components of success, are heritage and being in the right place at the right time.  The first component can be extremely difficult to write about in our ultra sensitive society because it looks at the cultural history of our respective ancestors to explain our \\"typical\\" behavior.  Few authors tackle that subject and remain successful.  The second component has been tackled by many authors from Dr. Morris Massey in the 60s (You are What You Were When) to Leonard Mlodinow's recent book on how randomness rules our lives (The Drunkard's Walk).  He reviews the events in the lives of folks from Bill Gates to the Beatles to support his premise, and in the Epilogue he includes the story of his own ancestors, focusing on his \\"mulatto\\" mother.  He concludes that Asians can attribute their expertise in math to their ancestral heritage of precise and tiring work in constructing and maintaining rice paddies, 360 days a year.  But then he takes a leap that all kids can accomplish good math grades by eliminating long summer vacations from school.  He doesn't consider the fact that the US used to lead the world in math when those long summer vacations were the norm. He contends that the \\"feuds\\" of Appalachia or the \\"angry\\", \\"explosive\\", and \\"volatile\\" behavior, and strange sounding \\"accents\\" of \\"Southerners\\" can be traced back to the \\"cultures of honor\\" from the \\"highlands and other marginally fertile areas such as Sicily or the mountainous Basque regions of Spain\\".  But he doesn't tell us how to correct inherited behavior patterns that have a negative impact on society.  Facetiously, I think the author missed an obvious recommendation, tailoring school schedules to the cultural ancestry of the student.  Asian students could start early each day and attend summer classes.  Caucasian students could sleep late.  Hispanic students could get mid-day siestas.  Appalachian students and others who descended from a \\"culture of honor\\" could merely phone it in. It's an interesting book, and a valid premise, but the conclusions are lame.
0790729725|5.0|This is the second greatest mafia movie ever made in my opinion, the greatest being (The Godfather), this movie has great action, great acting, including an unforgetable performance by Joe Pesci, great writing and directing, an american masterpiece.
B00004TJTS|4.0|Here's a bit of an unusual film: a modern-day movie - not animated - made more for adults than kids but could be equally enjoyed by both. There are  very few profanities, and nothing earth-shaking.    It's simply the memoirs of Willie Morris, a southern boy who wound up as a famous writer and editor of Harper's Magazine. Being that magazine is pretty Liberal, you get Liberal slants in the movie but nothing heavy-handed.    As a good story does, it makes you care about the characters, especially the lead one. In here it's \\"Willie\\" and his dog \\"Skip.\\" Early shots of Skip growing up - measured in how he related to the toilet bowl - are funny. You also care about his parents and are glad when the dad (Kevin Bacon) softens his stance on things.     As a guy, I appreciated just looking at Diane Lane. What a gorgeous face!    The cinematography is pure southern charm and looks great on DVD. It's not all sweetness. There are some angry moments and some sad ones, to be sure. In summary, however, a nice film.....pure and simple.
B000002UD7|5.0|IMO, \\"Actually\\" isn't just a great record--it's one of too few post-'60s records to successfully carry on that decade's pop-music archetype: songs (and album projects) simultaneously musically and intellectually challenging; both aesthetically rich (gorgeous! complex! catchy!) and modern in their analytical, de-constructive take on their subjects. On \\"Actually,\\" the subject is the '80s Thatcherite society-as-casino.    In recent years, PSB's work has become somewhat more personal, as they've brought to their songs an emotional vulnerability, a willingness to express loss and simple hurt, while also hanging onto the ambitiousness of their project. (See \\"Fundamental,\\" their brilliantly dark take on the Bush/Blair terrordrome decade.) Along the way, Neil Tennant has steadily become a subtler, more accomplished lyricist. Even so, \\"Actually\\"'s \\"What Have I Done to Deserve This,\\" \\"It's A Sin\\" and \\"Rent\\" could hardly be improved, lyrically, conceptually or musically.     Pet Shop Boys wouldn't make \\"Actually\\" today--they couldn't--but there is no better record of the '80s, double entendre intended. \\"Actually\\" is of that decade, yet at a very smart remove from it that keeps the album fresh and challenging. Still a remarkable achievement, and an awful lot of fun to listen to.

Now, I eagerly await summer vacation so I can tackle Anansi Boys.

B001F0VHEM|4.0|I have to admit I am not a Pink fan. My taste in music is anything but mainstream. I do like a few of her earlier songs from her first two albums but that is about it. I recently decided to check out her latest album FUNHOUSE after I heard a sample of the song \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\". Much to my surprise, I found myself enjoying FUNHOUSE quite a bit.  Pink's brand of pop/rock is energetic and a lot of fun to listen to. There were a few duds on the album. I am not fond of most of the ballads. I didn't particularly care for the bluesy \\"One Foot Wrong\\". I didn't like the melodies. The one ballad that I really dug was \\"I Don't Believe You\\". Alecia Moore's raspy vocals really meshes well with the music and lyrics. My other favorite songs on the album are the uptempo tracks which I think is where Pink's strength lies. I especially love the song \\"Bad Influence\\" which captures Pink's spunky attitude perfectly. The pop hooks quickly got ingrained in my head. The same can be said about \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\". While FUNHOUSE may not be perfect, I still found the album immensely satisfying to listen to for the most part.

0143039881|5.0|The story floating around in the zeitgeist about Eichmann in Jerusalem is that Hannah Arendt established how boring the Nazis were: that the men responsible for the destruction of millions were just paper pushers. This captures part of Arendt's book, but not nearly all of it. Overall, I think it's best to describe Eichmann in Jerusalem as a clear-eyed look at the trial of Adolf Eichmann, a study of guilt, and a dispassionate analysis of war-crimes trials. It's a tremendous book.<br /><br />Many Jews may stop reading when Arendt seems to accuse them of collaborating with the Nazis. I know virtually nothing about how this book was received, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if it offended a lot of people. If the historical record is as clear as Arendt claims, however, then there's nothing to get upset about. Councils of Jewish Elders, says Arendt, were formed in every country that the Nazis took over; those Councils documented the assets of the Jews within their communities, dutifully went around collecting them, turned them over to the Nazis, and only later found themselves herded into cattle cars to Auschwitz. In the death camps, she says, Jews did much of the gruesome work, like removing gold teeth from gas-chamber victims.<br /><br />This is obviously sensitive stuff. Arendt's style is to deliver it as honestly and forthrightly as possible. Her style, indeed, is tightly bound to her subject. She writes of Eichmann,<br /><br />  [H]e apologized, saying, \\"Officialese . . . is my only language.\\" But the point here is that officialese became his language because he was genuinely incapable of uttering a single sentence that was not a clich&eacute; ... To be sure, the judges were right when they finally told the accused that all he had said was \\"empty talk\\" -- except that they thought the emptiness was feigned ...<br /><br />She says elsewhere in Eichmann that the man's inability to speak was a symptom of his inability to think. It is her duty, then, to view Eichmann's trial with the clearest eye and sharpest mind possible.<br /><br />Readers may recall the backstory here: the Israelis kidnapped Eichmann from Argentina in 1960, tried him in Israel, and hanged him in 1962. The trial sought to paint Eichmann as one of the masterminds behind the Holocaust and the vilest sort of monster. Arendt retorts that he was, at best, a high-level functionary, and indeed a paper pusher, and that everyone at the trial could see immediately that this was the case. He never killed anyone, and indeed it seems pretty clear that the merest sight of blood would make the man queasy.<br /><br />None of this lets Eichmann off the hook, though, which is exactly the point: there's a world of difference between passers-by, who allowed the European Jews to be destroyed, and the Eichmanns who filed away the forms to send them to their destruction.<br /><br />Granted, then, that Eichmann deserved to pay in a way that the silent millions did not, why was Israel the proper forum for his punishment? Arendt is skeptical that it was. Eichmann's crime was a crime against humanity, and he should have been punished the same way that other Nazis were punished at Nuremberg. At the same time, no other nation had stepped up to try Eichmann, and Argentina was refusing to turn over the Nazis within its borders, so Israel may have had no choice. Arendt, and the court's decision itself, approvingly quote Grotius's line: \\"punishment is necessary `to defend the honor or authority of him who was hurt by the offence so that the failure to punish may not cause his degradation.'\\"<br /><br />Israel seemed to believe that it had the right to try Eichmann because of his crimes against the Jews, which makes me wonder: does Israel automatically grant itself the right to try crimes against Jews even today? Suppose some other country tried to kill all the Jews within its borders now; would Israel grant itself the right to try the leaders of that country?<br /><br />Arendt says that Israel's trial of Eichmann was much less about Eichmann and much more about the history of anti-Semitism from the time of Pharaoh all the way up to the Germans. There is an element of farce in all of this, and I think it's fair to say that Arendt took offense: a crime as serious as Eichmann's deserves a serious trial, rather than a circus. Fortunately the legal decision that came down at the trial's conclusion was a model of seriousness.<br /><br />Even with Eichmann swinging from the gallows, there's still the matter of Europe's guilt. Arendt, as ever, is only as brutal as she needs to be here: the nations of Europe stand guilty of allowing the slaughter to happen. The French, for instance, allowed foreign Jews within French borders to be shipped off to Germany, but put their foot down when the Nazis demanded French Jews. Their refusal to export their own Jews points out another matter: when nations said no to the Nazis, the Nazis often backed down. They were by no means an immovable wall of violence. The evil that European nations allowed to happen is all the more inexcusable when we know that there were exceptions.<br /><br />At the heart of all of this is the basic principle, which Arendt summarizes so well:<br /><br />  There remains, however, one fundamental problem, which was implicitly present in all these postwar trials and which must be mentioned here because it touches upon one of the central moral questions of all time, namely upon the nature and function of human judgment. What we have demanded in these trials, where the defendants had committed \\"legal\\" crimes, is that human beings be capable of telling right from wrong even when all they have to guide them is their own judgment, which, moreover, happens to be completely at odds with what they must regard as the unanimous opinion of all those around them.<br /><br />This moral question, and the denunciation that necessarily follows it, doesn't go away even if the Nazis mercilessly destroyed those who refused to follow their orders.

B001LRJH0U|5.0|I have not yet seen this film - so my 'score' is notional, based on reviews.  Despite excellent local and international reviews, the 'Dark Lords' of the major distributor houses in Australia have chosen NOT to allow access to this movie on the big screen (and it has still not been released on DVD).  ONE cinema in Sydney (population 4 million) screened this movie once a day (at 10 am) for 7 days - that's it!  Those of us in the 'provinces' (the rest of the country) had no chance at all.  YES, westerns ARE a highly endangered species.  Even good ones do not get release 'south of the equator' (same thing happened to 'Open Range' a few years back).  Disgruntled and disgusted.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|I loved reading McCullough's biography of John Adams. The movie on this DVD demonstrates that the HBO Producers and Director did not really read the book.

B0000CDJPQ|3.0|(Initially I gave this three stars, but then changed it to four. Oddly, when I previewed this review, it showed up as three and evidently I can't change it. So think FOUR stars as you read this.)    Having first found a few overpriced cables ($20-$30) for FW 6 to 9 pin, I was relieved to find this adapter. Most of the time it's fine. Occasionally, though, the 6-pin cable just won't quite set itself fully into the adapter and it takes just a little futzing. Nothing serious.    Another concern lies not in the quality of the item itself, but in keeping up with it IF you intend to take it from one place to the next. In just the first week or so with it, it's come off occasionally in my computer bag. Finding this tiny black adapter in a black bag, full of other equipment, magazines, etc. can be a little annoying. Nothing major -- four stars, remember.    I'll keep it as a backup with my old 400 cables. Meanwhile, to replace it, I've ordered two of the Tripp Lite F017-006 cables -- at $6.99 each.

I'm not sure what cd they are listening to in the Product Description \\"so here we come with a gorgeous, tremendous sounding reissue of the legendary album\\"<br /><br />Yes her voice sounds amazingly clear but the cd suffers from that \\"seashell\\" sound in the background.  I listen to my music with good Audio Technica headphones and its really quite distracting.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Excellent DVDs.  The video and sound quality are great.  The only not so good thing is the case.  It is very difficult to open and does not fit well on a standard shelf with other DVDs.
0060849827|2.0|It is a very comprehensive book, not too much detail, but enough in some places.     My first problem with the book is the size.   At 4.5 x 3.2 x 0.9 inches, I'm guessing it is meant to be taken on a trip with you. It's small. It is painful to read this at home. Seriously, it's not big and the pictures and letters are small. Not very good. And at about 1\\" thick, it is not anything that I would ever throw in my backpack.     There are parts of the book that would be great to take backpacking:   the edible plants section, snares, shelters, and a few others.   But the book is very broad in its topics. It will discuss the arctic and the tropics, plus everything in between.   Nice if the book was full size. But in something to take everywhere?? No. I'm not going to be in all those spots at once.   If it was compartmentalized, sure, I'd rip it apart and take what I need. But it's not.     It's a nice high level survival guide. General things on what to do in most areas. But really, it's not that useful.   If it was full size, with more detail, I'd use it as a reference before heading out.   If it was better sectioned, more thorough, I'd take it apart and take it with me.     Overall, I don't feel like this is a good purchase for me.
0312330537|2.0|I can't deny that Mr Roberts has a story to tell. I just wish it had been written by someone else, someone whose prose style isn't so flowery and cliche-ridden. I can't believe the praise that has been heaped on this book. Have these people ever read a truly well-written novel ? Roberts never uses one word when he can use ten. Everything is described in a cloying, 6th form way, all the characters are one-dimensional. I found it plain unreadable.
159102594X|4.0|Abercrombie does a nice job in this first of three books--laying the groundwork and developing characters.  At times this book can drag a little especially if your an action junkie---but when you get to the second and third books you'll see all the time you and Mr. Abercrombie puts in is well worth it.  Move over George RR Martin, Abercrombie has all your talent, he's younger, and hopefully more ambitious.
B001QB9H10|4.0|And he's even more buffed than before. YES!<br /><br />Ok, for the men out there, it's typical TRANSPORTER. At one point in the movie he is surrounded by the bad guys and he kicks butt and takes names. Just like the two previous TRANSPORTERS. I do wonder sometimes why the baddies aren't a little brighter. Honestly, were I one of the attackers, I'd just wait til his back was turned and pop him. (We're just getting through the James Bond Collection my husband got for Christmas, but the same question applies here: When the villian has the drop on the hero, why does he insist on talking? SHOOT, then have a conversation with a corpse!) We seem to be getting a Jason Statham collection going and in every one of them he takes off the shirt - by popular demand, no doubt -- and he gets surrounded by the villians. sigh  No originality whatsoever in any of the movies but the fact he does most his own stunts is very impressive.<br /><br />Wait. I had to check to see which one I was reviewing. Let's face it: there is no real difference in the three movies. Lots of action, Statham takes off his shirt, and there are rules. (In TRANSPORTER 2 you would think the producers would be aware of the rule that states two blue eyed people cannot have a brown eyed child, but...)  Regardless, I like his rules. I like his French inspector showing up in every movie. I LOVE the black cars. I like knowing he is the one doing the action shots instead of obvious stand-ins (Did you hear that Seagal?) I like the fact he has certain standards and is not willing to compromise them.<br /><br />Plot: cute redhead with a \\"bomb-cuff\\". Cute younger Transporter with a \\"bomb-cuff\\". Enter our Transporter. Cue the \\"bomb-cuff\\". Action, shirt off, romance, action, fast cars, action, ah the shirt is off again, kicking major butt.  Result, this is not an Oscar winner and Statham has already confirmed he knows this too. What this is, like the other two, is just fun.<br /><br />Get all three and have a marathon. That's what we did and a great night was had by all.t was had by all.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Throughout my life, I have been in and out of reasonable shape (exercising somewhat regularly in an ongoing battle with weight).  I did gain a good bit of weight just before getting pregnant with my first child at age 38.  My pregnancy was terrific and I only gained 25 pounds, although due to my starting weight I got very big and the back strain was difficult.  After my son was born (a very difficult delivery), I lost my pregnancy weight fast (within 2 weeks), but was left at my pre-pregnancy weight (plenty to lose) and in a lot of pain.  My son is now 6 months old, and after the initial couple of months of post-partum \\"recovery,\\" I have tried to get back into working out to lose weight.      The extra weight has hijacked my life - stealing enjoyment of my son, wreaking havoc on my self esteem, and affecting all areas of my life.  Most disturbing has been chronic back pain.  Since my 3rd trimester, my back has been screaming in pain from the moment I wake up and throughout the day.  Now, even picking up my son has been difficult, depending on the position, and sitting down with him to nurse in a chair sometimes causes so much pain on the way to sitting position that I have cried out.  My efforts to work out have been sabotaged by my back pain, and although I have been able to get into a walking routine (once I get moving, I'm ok), the aftermath back pain has been horrible.  I had just about come to the conclusion that having a baby has simply ruined my body and that I was doomed to suffer with this back pain indefinitely.     The compelling event was that my husband and I are going on a trip at the end of April with his work colleagues.  Sun and sand, what would have formerly been a dream, is now a dread due to my weight and discomfort.  I had to do something.    Through a stroke of luck more than anything, I landed on your exercise DVDs on Amazon, and I was struck by the overwhelming positive response for your 30-Day Shred DVD - over NINE HUNDRED people are singingyour praises!!!  As a new mom, I don't have a lot of time to fit in exercise during the day, and by evening, I'm too exhausted to even THINK about exercising.  So the 22-minute end-to-end commitment was enticing, too.  I figured that I can do pretty much anything for 22 minutes, right?    I received the DVD on Monday and started the workout on Tuesday morning when my son went down for his morning nap.    That workout kicked my butt.  Which is no surprise because I'm heavy and struggling to get back into shape.  I was SORE SORE SORE by Tuesday afternoon, but Wednesday and Thursday mornings I stuck to it each morning.  Wednesday I was still extremely sore, but by Thursday night I was a little less sore.  Progress!    On Friday morning, I woke up without back pain.  WITHOUT PAIN.  Normally when you have a headache, it often seems to go away without fanfare, but my back pain is no headache.  Believe me, I NOTICED.  I got out of bed without sharp pain, was able to go to the bathroom without wincing in pain on the way to \\"sit\\" (sorry if this is TMI), and carried my son down a flight of stairs with confidence that my back was not going to \\"give out\\" with sharp pain.  I cannot believe it - I am absolutely overwhelmed with the idea that I might actually get my LIFE back.      After only FOUR DAYS of working out, I feel better than I have in MONTHS.  In fact, I told my husband that I honestly can't remember the last time I felt SO GREAT.  My posture is better, I feel better emotionally, and I am SO READY to stick with this program for the remainder of the 30 days (which is when our trip starts) and BEYOND. I already eat very healthfully, so this might just have been the missing link.     I went into this program with the goal of quick weight loss, but no matter what the scale says, I honestly feel that I have already reaped more benefit than \\"just that.\\"  I am stronger already and I feel like I have my life back.  THANK GOD.  This workout is incredible.  I am sooooo thankfulthat I started this program - it is really going to CHANGE MY LIFE.      THANK YOU JILLIAN!
1416914307|5.0|I agree with the poster that said that certain authors should take note, this is the way that you end a series! That is exactly the way I felt when I finished City of Glass. Do not get me wrong, I love the Twilight Saga and there is no question that that saga paved the way for this one, but the writing of this series is on another level. It was everything that I wanted it to be.  All of my questions were answered.  There was actually a battle at the end, not a silly chess game. Jace and Clary are two of my favorite characters. Should Clare decide to return to this series, I will be the first in line! I look forward to reading more novels by Cassandra Clare.
B00005JPY2|5.0|And that, in a nutshell, is what is great and not so great about \\"Watchmen\\".  I must apologize for being esoteric, but if I explain it I would be guilty of spoilers.  It should suffice to say that said \\"Archie\\" scene was both a defining moment of this films wonderful human elements and gratuitous to the point of being tedious.  That said, one scene, or 6 or 7 for that matter, were not enough to spoil my enjoyment of a film by a guy who has made one of my least favorite films (300).  If you haven't realized by now, this is never an easy film, yet I was surprisingly up to the challenge.  Before I really start to ramble on, I'd better chop this up a little.<br /><br />REDEMPTION FOR ZACK SNYDER?<br />It sure sounds like I'm picking a fight (who, ME?) but I have my reasons.  For better or worse, Zack has made a name for himself by bringing comic books to life on screen (excuse me, \\"Graphic Novels\\" puh-lease!).  His first big hit \\"Sin City\\" was pretty successful and highly regarded.  I'll be damned if I'll ever get to see it.  It's been on my list for years.  Yet, I'll take the word of those who liked it.  Next was \\"300\\".  What can I say that my \\"300\\" review didn't; it was a silly cartoon based on one of the greatest last stands in human history.  Though faithful to the equally goofy comic... ...excuse me; GRAPHIC NOVEL (yeesh!) I thought it was highly overrated and translated poorly to the cinema.  So, knowing he directed \\"Watchmen\\" was not working as an endorsement for me.  In fact, I had great trepidation that this would be another nutty \\"300\\" with cartoon violence and gratuitous sex.  I was right.<br /><br />I'M NOT A FAN OF NOIR COMIC BOOKS (or \\"Graphic Novels\\")<br />I almost bought this book.  But as I leafed through it at the book store, I decided I would pass on its meager 1940's style graphics and tiny word bubbles.  This was all done for a great purpose that the comic geeks could tell you about, but it wasn't pulling me in.  I'm not a big fan of the trend towards dark comics with dystopian alternate realities either.  I don't mind troubled characters but I want them to succeed on some level and at least live in a normal, screwed up world.  A world on the brink of self destruction is a bit too heavy for me. Besides, I don't like clouding my judgment of a film by reading the book first.  I work in reverse order.  This book has all the things I don't want in a comic and the film followed suit.<br /><br />GRATUITOUS IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH A WORD<br />There was a point in this movie when I leaned over to my friend (yes, I have a couple) and whispered; \\"is this what they mean by \\"blue movie\\"?\\".  My friend chuckled.  You see, the god-like Dr. Manhattan, who always glows in a blue light, was getting it on with the \\"Silk Specter\\".  So, they were having sex in blue light.  Ok, it's not so funny when you read it, but I thought it was a good one.  Anyway, like 300, sex scenes seem to be sprinkled in just for kicks.  Now I'm not against sex in general, but as the saying goes; been there, done that.  Though sex actually does enhance some moments of the film (the \\"Archie\\" scene I alluded to earlier) it really does nothing to move the plot along.  In fact the \\"Archie\\" scene was more of a comedic moment than the steamy hot moment it was depicted to be.  I guess super heroes with ED require different cures.  It's funny what can float your boat (you'll just have to see it).  Regardless, this might have been the only time in the film where I got a little bored (crazy, I know).  This doesn't sound so bad until you see Dr. Manhattan getting all up in your face with his schlong for extended periods.  I'm not particularly prudish about full frontal nudity when handled properly, but this was a bit much.  This blue god-man was every man's worst locker room nightmare; the naked guy who acts like he's dressed.  You know the one.  He walks around without a towel and insists on carrying on conversations with his wanker hanging in your face.  You can tolerate this for a minute or two, but he insists on walking around like this for 20 minutes or so.  That's how Dr. Manhattan comes across in this movie.  I don't want to get into his god-like mindset (what god needs cloths?), I just don't need to see him, or a woman for that matter, standing there naked ALL THE TIME!  I'm a big believer in sexual teasing in films.  There's nothing more arousing than that.<br /> I haven't even touched on the violence in this film.  Unlike \\"300\\" with its CG blood spraying everywhere, \\"Watchmen\\" holds back a little more.  Yet there is no shortage of dismemberment, face-smashing, bone-popping brutality.  Though the action is limited, I thought it was well staged and not nearly as posed as in \\"300\\".  I kind of enjoyed that part of it.  So, in review; Sex and nudity is too much.  Bone crushing brutal violence is OK.  As twisted as that sounds it was all gratuitous to the nth degree.<br /><br />IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS<br />I wouldn't say \\"Watchmen\\" has a particularly great or original story.  What makes it original are its characters.  You've got a guy who's a lot like Batman on the surface, yet nothing like Batman in demeanor.  You've got a hero who is only a hero based on which side he's on.  Some call these types \\"anti-heroes\\".  I call them A-holes.  You've got slutty vulnerable women heroes who kick butt; very cool.  You've got a guy who is nothing like Batman on the surface, but has an even deeper, demented lack of compromise when it comes to justice.  You've got the genius hero trying to save humanity with big swings and you've got the Goddish Dr. Manhattan who muddies the waters with his fading touch with humanity.  What you end up with is a bunch of gifted people with all their warts and flaws trying, for the most part, to do the right things even if it kills us.  As far as superheroes go, they mostly appear to be highly skilled fighters with mysterious enhanced strength or agility.  Even though you never truly understand how most of the characters came by there special abilities, it never really is that important to know with the exception of Dr. Manhattan.  The biggest bummer of them all is that my favorite character bites the big one in the end.  The great thing is I cared.<br /><br />WHO'S WATCHING THE WATCHMEN?  I AM!!<br />It's no big surprise then that I loved this movie.  Despite never having read the book, despite my disdain for the genre and Zack Snyder, despite what I felt was overwrought sexuality (crazy, I know) and despite a story that wasn't great, I loved this movie.  I was entertained for almost the entire 3+ hours.  For this I can thank the perfectly cast actors (check IMDB for details) portraying incredible characters that drip with humanity (Dr. Manhattan not withstanding).  The story serves well enough as a scaffold for these character to interact and react in.  I also have to give proper respect to Zack Snyder for actually not overdoing MOST of this film.  In fact, most of it was just plain stunning to look at.  I don't care if the book's author was cheesed off about this production.  I don't care if it was true to source material or not (as I haven't read it).  As a Superhero movie \\"Watchmen\\" just bumped down a bunch of other Super-movies on my list, including \\"Dark Knight\\".

B000MRA5NS|5.0|By adding my own review of [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale]] to all these others -- making mine the 1,268th -- I expect to accomplish nothing more than to conjoin my voice to the chorus of praise for the best James Bond movie in years.  Until this came along, I had written the franchise off.  But I enjoyed this so much, I didn't mind buying it twice, first on DVD, then later upgrading to [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale [Blu-ray]]].  The hi-def picture was absolutely phenomenal, and whenever I want to impress upon someone the difference Blu-ray makes, I pull this one out as the demo.  From the retro grainy black-&-white introduction, thru sunny tropical locations, to the darker European countryside and luxurious interiors, a full range of textures and tones is sampled, making this engrossing story beautiful to look at, something to savor over multiple viewings.  Daniel Craig's powerful performance makes it all the sweeter.<br /><br />Selecting the actor to play Fleming's iconic character is Hollywood's equivalent to the Vatican picking a new pope.  In the limbo between films, the people gather and wait.  When the studio finally announced amidst the usual &eacute;clat that Craig had been chosen to fill the tuxedo, the surprising selection was a signal that something major was going down.  It was a ballsy break with tradition, and it paid off.  Craig owned that part, and his Bond will be what future generations will compare his successors to. Of course it helped that he had a topnotch script, which hews closer to the novel than any Bond film since around [[ASIN:B001AQO3WO From Russia with Love]], after which they became increasingly distracted with silly gadgets (excepting [[ASIN:B000LY4J3E On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]).  The stuff about the footrace and the tanker at the airport were added, along with the stuff on the boat with Vesper in the epilogue.  But the salient points of the rest of the story have some basis in the novel.  It distinguishes itself further with its emotional detail, beginning with a pre-credit sequence marked with a psychological gamesmanship that was maintained on some level throughout the rest of the film.  It's tightly crafted, wasting nothing, slamming into Chris Cornell's \\"You Know My Name\\" through the barrel of the trademark gunshot and swirl, then moving through the locales, hewn seamlessly through great editing and strong musical cues of variations of the theme.  The pacing gives the story enough time to breath, but never lingers.  It flows.  Even the card game itself to me was exciting, and I don't play cards.<br /><br />I was prompted to write this review today because I ordered the Blu-ray edition of [[ASIN:B001PPLIFU Quantum of Solace]], and anticipating its arrival has got me appreciating all over again just how good [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale]] was.  At first disappointed that [[ASIN:B001PPLIFU Quantum of Solace]] didn't have the same subtleties as [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale]], I've since come to see it as part two of this one great story.  It should be here Saturday.  In the meantime, I'll refresh the continuity by watching this one again.<br />________________________________________________________ional detail, beginning with a pre-credit sequence marked with a psychological gamesmanship that was maintained on some level throughout the rest of the film.

031606792X|5.0|This book branches out with more characters then the others but with Stephenie Meyer's amazing writing style you don't get lost in a bunch of people you have never heard of. She knows her book so well! I love how through out all of her books she drop subtle reminders of who is who and what they are to the story. That really helps as the story goes on with my things being added I still felt that I had a good grasp on who was who and I still go to know and like or dislike each one. These books are all amazing! So worth reading over and over again! :)
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This movie isn't anything I expected, I thought it would be like a Western movie, but it was way better. It has beautiful scenery, and is well acted, and had a wonderful story attached. This movie stars Nicole Kidman, and Hugh Jackman. It's about a widow raising cattle on her property, and one of her cattlemen tries to steal from her so she decides to take the cattle to Darwin during the start of WW11 in Australia. Along the way, her old cattleman tries to kill off/steal cattle from her. As a side story, she is also raising her friend's Aboriginal son, who also comes along on the cattle drive. He is just a little boy, and she's very protective of him. Back in those days if you're a 'creamy' color, the athorities would take those children away from their families and put them is schools to teach them white ways of living, all along the way Nicole Kidman's character is worried this will happen to her new charge. This movie is really long, but doesn't lose your interest. This is a recommended movie in our family.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Mad Men is one of my favorite shows on TV right now.  John Hamm and January Jones are phenomenal.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|This is my second swivel sweeper. I use it to sweep floors in my restaraunt and have really put it to the test. I love It,  It is so easy to push and picks up dirt very well. The problem is the batteries don't last. The battery only lasts about 10-15 min. before you have to plug it in again.  The first one I bought the battery lasted much longer,  So either I got a dud or the product is inconsistent.
1567184855|5.0|I found this book in 2008. This is my book of the year!<br />It shows the stuff other esoteric authors hint on. If they touched different parts of an elefant - Newton saw it as a whole and tells us. Tells us what is going to be after death and before the new birth.<br />Thanks, Michael!
B00001OH7P|5.0|Whenever I hear a song from this album I need to play all of it. it is one of those albums that makes you want to hear the whole thing from beginning to end. By far his best album in my opinion. From the urgency of \\"5 years\\" to the introspective \\"rock n roll suicide \\" this is a complete perfectly flowing album. If your new to Bowie and are looking for a good offering from this period in his career, this is where to start.
B000RMQH30|5.0|I like the fact that this is just good honest music, not studio retouched. This is the first Ben Harper album I have ever bought and now want to buy more!

B001ER4CNY|5.0|I am very happy to now own this set.I love it.Brings back wonderful memories of watching this when I was younger.Great for anyone who enjoyed this long ago.I will enjoy watching these again and again.Yes,the bottle is cardboard,however,I bought the set for the dvds,not for looks.So,if you like the show,get this set.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I've now caught up on BREAKING BAD by watching all of Season One on DVD and Season Two on DVR.  I've been extremely impressed by what I've seen so far, and consider all that I've seen so far to be first rate.  While I'm not yet convinced that this is going to end up a truly great series, it clearly has enormous potential and is buoyed by several exceptional performances, especially by Bryan Cranston as Walter White.<br /><br />Just about everything that has taken place so far on the show has been beyond criticism.  My hesitation in proclaiming this a masterpiece or even one of the best shows currently on television stems from a lack of sense what the endgame of the show is.  Only time will eliminate my hesitancy.  If it turns out that Vince Gilligan has a clear vision of where this show will eventually end up and if that vision is compelling, then this will indeed go down as a great series.  Does Gilligan have a rough storyboard for the entire series?  Or does he just have a rough idea of where the next season is going?  It is an important distinction.  Although Ron Moore repeatedly hinted that he had only a few ideas of where he was taking BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, the ending and the way it deeply coheres with so much that happened even in the first couple of seasons leads me to believe that he was essentially deceiving us and really knew all along.  Contrast this with a series that was just making it up as it went along, THE X-FILES (a series upon which Gilligan worked extensively).  Although there were many great episodes on that show and a host of memorable aspects, in the end it was a show that was greatly harmed by the ramshackle long story arc, with a host of variant versions of key events (e.g., what precisely happened to Mulder's sister and who his father was, answers to which changed several times over the course of the show).  We simply haven't had enough episodes of BREAKING BAD for us to tell whether there is an end towards which everything is pointing.<br /><br />That being said, there are a number of things I really love about this show.  Sticking with narrative structure for the moment, I like that many of the episodes more or less pick up from the end of the previous episode.  I'm a passionate believer in the superiority of serial narrative.  Almost without exception all the TV series that I have loved over the course of the past twenty years have featured serial narratives; virtually none have been episodic.  I love the complexity of character and story that can result from this.  And BREAKING BAD clearly has embraced the serial format.  This will, in the end, be a series with a definite beginning, middle, and end.<br /><br />I also have been blown away -- along with everyone else -- by Bryan Cranston as Walter White.  He was good in MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, but he is so much better in this it is as if Jerry Seinfeld had gone to sleep and work up Laurence Olivier.  The range and depth of his performance is absolutely astonishing.  I especially love how nuanced he makes Walter.  Although someone engaged in criminal activity, he does so from a sense of moral obligation.  He is pursuing immoral means to achieve a moral end.  Above all he is a man dedicated to caring for his family.  At no point is this illustrated more than in the moment where he compiles a list of the reasons for sparing and the reasons for killing Crazy Eight, a drug dealer being held in his partner's basement.  In the \\"not to kill\\" column he has a long, long list of compelling reasons.  In the \\"kill\\" column, there is only one:  if he lets him go he will kill both him and his family.  That pretty much sums up Walter.  He will do no wrong, unless by so doing he endangers his family.<br /><br />Another thing I love about the show is the wide range of responses it evokes.  Although essentially a drama, I find myself laughing constantly.  His life has been reduced to one long absurdity, and Gilligan does not hesitate to emphasize this by showing how ridiculous things are.  But the show can turn on on a dime to go from humorous or dramatic, to out and out shocking.  There are many, many OMG! moments one the show.<br /><br />This has become one of the shows that I simply won't miss.  No one who cares about quality television should neglect catching up on this one ASAP.show can turn on on a dime to go from humorous or dramatic, to out and out shocking.

B000WD7CCO|5.0|I love this show very much and I miss watching it. It gets you excited as when the  'end' of the series will come, but it seems like it never does. Makes you jump into the wrong conclusions and laugh about it. Fun to watch at a late Friday night ;D
B00004XPPB|5.0|WOW!!! To these two actors!! This movie really brings out Johnny Depps acting ability.  If you like Goodfellows you will absolutely love this movie.  Grab a bowl of popcorn, a soda, and get ready for the adventure it takes you one.  Mafia at it's best.

This inspires creativity and encourages writing and reading both.  Well worth every penny we paid for it.  Not to mention that it will be a treasure to look back on in future years at what our child was thinking and doing at this point in his life.  EXCELLENT!  Wish we could find more items like this.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|I am a fan of Jason Statham's work and this was pretty good. Whilst the original Death Race 2000 still had some elements that was hard to top the re-make was flashier, had better special effects and was grittier than the original. Definitely worth adding to your collection.

B0018CMJSU|5.0|The Godfather and Part II are my favorite movies ever. Part III, while not like the others is also an excellent movie. This Gifset is the best thing we fans can ask for. With the sharp restoration and bonus material that is a true treasure, this is a no-brainer purchase. These movies are, in my opinion, the finest that Hollywood had ever created and films nowadays should learn a little from this in order to deliver better products instead of the crap that most of them are.
B001P3OMY6|5.0|I was really surprised when I read this book. It is very funny with lots of allusions to Jane Austen's books and characters. It is also very Bridget Jonesy and tongue in cheek. I thought is was a delightful book! Thanks for the chuckles Ms. Hale.
0141439513|5.0|Prior to reading Pride and Prejudice, I had seen excerpts designed to paint Jane Austen's writing as stuffy, obtuse, and generally boring. One joke says that Ms. Austen's novels are like active mysteries that engage the reader in trying to find the hidden verb in each sentence. But these criticisms are not only unfair, they're entirely inaccurate: just a few pages into Pride and Prejudice, Austen's writing style ceased being an obstacle to my enjoyment and began being a central part thereof. The manner in which she builds sentences and paragraphs is pure a delight to the modern reader, even 200 years after the fact.<br /><br />Austen's true accomplishment here is that she makes a novel in which \\"so little\\" happens, by modern standards at least, so darn interesting! As one critic put it, this is a 367-page story in which the central events are a man changing his manners and a lady changing her mind. But oh how the web of intrigue is weaved! The subtleties of character development and plot construction are never forced and always as natural as they are glorious. This truly is a literary triumph, and the first great novel that places women and their happiness at the center; that focuses on dialog and feelings more than swordplay and seafaring. Its interlocking characters are so rich and well-defined, unlike anything in the preceding novels on [[ASIN:0393050947 The Well-Educated Mind]]'s reading list. And even though the story ends up exactly as you know it will from Page 1, it's still all so satisfying!<br /><br />Is the book pretentious? Elitist? Maybe. But consider it a study of a particular class of people during a particular point in history. That's what it is. The heroine, with whom I agree with the author when she described her to be \\"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print,\\" is bucking social conventions, but she can only do so much. She can't emancipate Woman in one fell swoop, nor is that her motivation. But Elizabeth's actions and this novel in general were one small step for Woman, at least, and an incredibly enjoyable read if nothing else. Five stars all the way!eral were one small step for Woman, at least, and an incredibly enjoyable read if nothing else. Five stars all the way!
B001N18HO6|5.0|Back in the early 90s I personally had no specific tastes in music. highschool was just over, I was doing my national service in the army, 80s were over, things seemed a bit bland as far as I remember. I guess I was still sort of a lapsed Depeche Mode, The Cure, Echo kind of fan... I hadn't listened to Heavy Metal properly for 5 years or so. Biggest album for me in 1990-91 was The La's debute.<br /><br />Then this mamoth of an album broke on the World.<br /><br />I had heard Smells Like Teen Spirit and all that, but I tend to avoid whatever everyone suddenly likes, but then came Pearl Jam. And I was hooked line and sinker.<br /><br />To this day I remember falling in love with Grunge. The whole Seattle scene, the people, the style, or lack there of. I didn't mind people calling music like this Grunge. I still don't. The bands might not have liked it then, or now, but I don't care, to me Grunge was and is a period in musical history that had an effect on me and my tastes.<br /><br />Ok, so I didn't have the internet then, and some bands never caught my attention. Back then we had to rely on MTV (even in Norway) to tell us what was what (I never was a big radio listener, and what would that have mattered anyhow?), so I thought Stome Temple Pilots were part of it all (I suppose they were sort of, but from San Diego, who knew?), loved them, and I thought Alice in Chains were the same band as Soul Asylum (So, I hated them). Now I know better. Now I even think Nirvana was great, but that's Dave's doing, with his Foo Fighters.<br /><br />Now I listen to Soundgarden, Alice, Sreaming Trees, Mother Love Bone, Mudhoney, Stone Temple Pilots and even L7. And yes, I keep them all on my ipod under my Grunge Playlist. So, maybe they don't agree, I don't know, I don't care, because Pearl Jam and their fantastic album Ten (and subsequent masterpiece VS.) caught me on my jaw with their sublime music, great lyrics and of course the otherworldly voice of Eddie Vedder.<br /><br />This is where it all began to me, my musical moment of being young and defining my music. Even watching Singles on videotape a half million times.<br /><br />This set it sublime. It holds such treasures to a Pearl Jam fan, it really needs to be seen. And heard. My biggest love in here so far is the MTV unplugged DVD. I have wanted to see this for years. Having seen Alice in Chains and Nirvanas set pieces out on DVD for quite a while now, it was about time.<br /><br />The photo's are really fun to look through, some of the stuff is, well, fluff I suppose, but this isn't for the casual Pearl Jam listener, this is for the fans out there who absolutely adore them. And since I do, I can tell you, if you too adore them, this is well worth the wait and the cost.<br /><br />A monumental piece of rock history this, the set itself of course, but I also remember what Henry Rollins said about the album Ten. He said something along the lines that; 'Nirvana may have been the band everyone talked about as being the second comming, but Pearl Jams Ten was the album that sold. Everyone heard it', he was sure, 'if you were dropped in the middle of the Amazonas jungle, you would never be more than 10 minutes away from a copy of Pearl Jams Ten'.nt of being young and defining my music.

B001N26GFM|4.0|I found the film The Boy in the Striped Pajamas a very good and moving film.  It is every bit as good as the novella and it really puts faces on the characters, especially the particularly brutal ones.  The heavy British accents of the actors, however, hinder the portrayals of the performers as being not only Nazis, but also as Germans.  Perhaps actual German dialog with English subtitles would have been more effective as has been provided in many other powerful films involving the war.  It is, however, a powerful example of how hate is taught and learned, and that a righteous might can be assumed for virtually any cause or philosophy regardless of how many have to die to justify it.  It is still well worth watching, and the ending is totally numbing.  The ending was not foreshadowed throughout the film.  I would highly recommend this film as an educational tool, especially for middle-school age children and as an introduction to the Holocaust.  In this age of neo-nazism and holocaust denial it can really define hate movements and intolerance for what they can become and are, and the unexpected consequences of such choices.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is alot of fun is isn't very hard to learn. It's kind of a cult favorite at my college. Strategy is an important aspect, but young players enjoy it just as much as older players. Its a unique game in that aspect. Highly recommended. The guy who invented this games is probably almost a genius.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|For those of you who enjoy a good zombie novel but just can't find that perfect zombie book, this is the one for you! The book is realistic and with all of the different stories you read from all of the different characters you could truly see this happening. It makes you want to go out and prepare for when zombie war starts. Even if you are not into zombies, this book will still engage you and make you want to read more and more zombie novels. I would recommend this book to anyone who just want to sit down and read a good zombie book. Max Brooks is one of the great writers who understands zombies. If you read one zombie book this should be the one.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|This is the first review that I've ever put on Amazon, or any other online retailer for that matter.  That just speaks how highly I think of this album.      Yes, it is somewhat close to pop... Its certainly radio-friendly and yes, I could see how this music could be associated with teeny-boppers.    But I'm a 28 year old successful stockbroker (kind of an oxymoron in this economy), and I cannot speak highly enough of this album.      The tracks flow beautifully, each has a clever hook; and the band is amazing.  The drums are tight, yet not overpowering; the guitar work is clever - being subtle when it needs to be, yet can turn on a dime and become the centerpiece of the song.  The lead singer of this band, amazingly enough, is 18 years old.  Her vocal range is nothing short of astounding... this girl really has a set of pipes on her.     So yes, call it pop or whatever else you may want.  But in my opinion...    Best Album in the last 5 years.
1400032717|1.0|I can only say thank you to the author for encouraging me to learn on my own how to speed read my way through this.  Having paid money for this, I didn't want to just throw it away, but wanted to somehow get through it.  Poorly done.  Don't waste your time.
0060254920|1.0|This is a fine example of how following the crowd will get you no where. Especially if the leader of that crowd has no idea where he is going. Many years ago it was decided that this was an exceptional book. It received a very prestigious award. And like the Emperor's new clothes many gather around to praise it. But was it truly deserved or could it be that the author, whom had been nominated various times before was thrown a bone. Like Whoopi Goldberg performance in \\"The Color Purple\\" but winning for \\"Ghost\\" Who's to say. When I read this story all I thought was \\"nice drawings\\" . Yes those drawings stand out more than a single line in this story. Can anyone quote a verse from this story. If I read it to you would you recall it. Yet flash a picture and the memories flood back of library cards and book reports. If your looking for a classic story to read your children or grandkids. Keep searching because this tale does't qualify.
B001437DMA|5.0|Joe is simply the best. I have almost everthing he has evey recorded. At first, I thought it was too much like all the rest. Just I thought...after two or three listening sessions, it became my favorite! If you are a Satch fan, buy it!
B000003GMQ|3.0|3 1/2    These hard-progers rarely fail at delivering large space-rock excursions for the fanbase. Few modern neo-Floyd acts do it as consistently, albeit in watered down fashion. There just is a bit too much lifeless downtime to cover over an hours worth of compelling material on most of their good-not-great discs, and Signify does not signify much of a difference.
B00064ADR0|3.0|Second Winter is an excellent studio disc, and if I were just reviewing that, I'd give it five stars.  The Albert Hall concert has its moments, but to compare it to the Allman Bros. \\"Live at the Fillmore\\" as a previous reviewer did is blasphemous.  Johnny's guitar playing and singing are first rate as always, and Tommy Shannon was a rock solid bass player, but I'm subtracting two full stars for the presence of Brother Edgar on this record.  If I never hear him sing \\"Tobacco Road\\" again, it will be too soon, let me tell you.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This is a favorite video of my teenage daughter. She has wanted it for quite some time, and was happy to find it here at an affordable price.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Awesome flick! If you like movies such as (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill 1 & 2, From Dusk Till Dawn, Natural Born Killers etc...) YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE! With its amazing cast, the look of it remains exceptional, a high-contrast monochrome showcase of sheeting rain, shattering glass and white-on-black silhouettes, with occasional motifs picked out in vivid color. Entertaining, Sexy, comic and ultra-violent. A stunning explosion of black & white with splashes of red.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday. We just got a blu-ray player and the picture quality is amazing! This is a definite buy! We are still waiting for Amazon to send season 2 and 3 on blu-ray but can't wait.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I was reluctant to buy this since I already own Lilo & Stitch on DVD and the posted special features didn't look all that different from the previous DVD release. But since this is one of my favorite Disney films I went and got it anyway.    I'm so glad I decided to buy this.    The biggest thing missing on the other DVD release was a commentary and I was legitimately surprised to find one here after Chris Sanders' recent turmoil with Disney.    The entire second disc is a documentary on the making of the film. Whereas most \\"making of\\" featurettes for animated films last about 10 minutes and focus on the voice talent, this one is 2 hours long (more than 30 minutes longer than the actual film) and covers almost every step of the production you could think of. From the origins of the story, though major plot changes, on down to playing with the Happy Meal toys.    Even better than the actual documentary are the \\"footnotes,\\" clips that support the main piece. These include earlier versions of scenes, drawing sessions with the lead animators, and interviews with animation legends Joe Grant & Maurice Noble. My personal favorite is the production style guide that defines basic rules of the Lilo & Stitch look.    This is right up there with Disney's 2 disc version of Atlantis for the sheer amount of extras. If you're an animation fan, you have to get this.
B000YAA68C|5.0|Hilary Swank is such a versatile actress.  Is there a role she can't play well?  In PS - I Love You, she plays Holly, a young widow who's lost the love of her life to cancer.  Gerry, her husband, knows his death is going to be hard on her and arranges a year's worth of letters and gifts to be delivered to Holly at specific occasions.      The year sees Holly take an emotional roller coaster ride.  At time she completely withdraws and friends and family go from concern to just having enough of it and moving on without her.  In the end, with the last letter from Gerry telling her get on with it, and a heart to heart with her mom, Holly rejoins the world, reconnects with her friends and finds a new path for herself.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This DVD rocks! Level 1 is not hard at all, but a great place to start. I advanced to Level 2 within a week, but Level 3 kicks butt! I am sore everytime I do Level 3. I ended up buying the longer work-out videos because these segments were too short for me. However, it is a great and short work-out before heading out to work. I am not sure how shredded it would make me or if I would even lose weight using it.
B0010X745K|1.0|This refers to Marcia Gay Harden's character. It is interesting to note that Hollywood often misrepresents Christians as either Bible quoting psychos or knife wielding schizophrenics (\\"There Will be Blood\\"). It's politically incorrect of vilify Muslims, Buddhists, Wiccans, Satanists, New Agers and athiests. But hey, in Hollywood, Christians are fair game. Such misrepresentation reminds of a subtle version of Hitler's anti-semitic propaganda just before the Nazis hauled the Jewish people into the concentration camps.
9562913686|2.0|Some time ago, a friend shared with me a copy of Dr. Joseph Murphy's \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\", Revised and Expanded Edition, which I found insightful, and wanted to purchase to keep around.  I buy my books primarily through Amazon, and prefer hardcover editions, which tend to last longer.  So, when I found the edition I am reviewing, ISBN 956-291-368-6, I was thrilled and ordered it immediately.  Imagine my unpleasant surprise when I received the book and found that its text was substantially different from the original I've read, not to say that the layout of the text represented a true \\"hack job\\" - no space between the paragraphs, no italics or different fonts used in Dr. Murphy's original, and so important for laying out and emphasizing his ideas.  It turned out that although the book I purchased was listed on Amazon as a \\"Revised Edition\\", it represented some strange creation by a little-known publishing house \\"BN Publishing\\", which copyrighted the text in 2006.  Now, the original book by Dr. Murphy was copyrighted first in 1963, with further copyrights following in 1988 and 1997.  May be for some reason the copyright collapsed and vultures moved in? Who knows!  At any rate, for those who are interested in Dr. Murphy's real text, the book to get is either ISBN 978-0-7352-0168-2 or ISBN 978-0-7352-0431-7, the latter inscribed on the front page as \\"The only edition authorized by Dr. Joseph Murphy Trust\\". As for the hardcover edition I bought - I am returning it.  And Amazon should be ashamed of carrying this product, which, in my humble opinion, represents an infringement on Dr. Murphy's copyright.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|This is one of those films that grows better with time - just like a good wine.  Firstly I wasn't sure about whether I liked it or not, but in the end I think of it as a sweet and cozy film that I enjoyed and would like to view more than once. It is a feel-good movie and I think that Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard are doing an excellent performance.
B001TOD92C|5.0|In a blazing triumph of American film making, The Wrestler is exactly what the bulk of films can never achieve; realism, intensity, sensitivity, regret, love, lust, redemption, and glory all in the same dazzling effort. All the while accomplishing what it sets out to be, and perhaps more, it is also the best character study that I have seen in years.<br /><br />The director is wise to waste no time in throwing you into the violence. If that's something that is going to put you off from the film then it's just as well that it's done at the first. That said, I didn't see this film as being overly violent. The violence is a necessary device used in the right moments to let the viewer know what the life of a wrestler, and this particular wrestler, is all about. The aftereffects are shown so it is not for the sake of gratuity.<br />As I mentioned, the violence is limited. It only occurs in a few scenes that are very integral to the plot and it isn't lingered on, glorified, or depicted without realistic consequences.<br /><br />This film would not be half of what it is without the commanding, captivating, and soul rendering performances of the brilliant Mickey Rourke and always engaging and fascinating Marisa Tomei. Each one had their character in their guts and it shows on the screen.<br /><br />Rourke, in his true form and element, plays Ram. He's the battle scarred, drug and steroid-taking, estranged from his daughter wrestler who has seen better days years earlier when he was at the top of the card as a major star for larger promotions. He now finds himself on the wrestling slagheap and is working independent shows on the weekends for a wad of cash while living in a trailer and having to work at lowly jobs in a store through the week. Rourke runs the emotional marathon between extreme pride and respect on the weekends to the forced humility and the poverty of a working stiff at an entry level job during the week. To make matters less pleasant, his bosses seem less than sympathetic about having him around. Through this all, one can't help but feel the isolation, loneliness and pain of the character of Ram. The most affecting scene for me in this regard is when Ram is at an autograph signing with a bunch of obviously broken down wrestlers and there are very few fans and he just looks around and contemplates the desolation. It is one of the saddest moments in the any film. Mickey Rourke deserves every award that he was nominated for, including the Academy Award.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei plays a stripper at a club that Ram frequents and they have an obvious attraction for each other. Tomei's character is supposed to be past her prime and not one of the strippers who are in high demand due to her advancing age. The idea of men not being attracted to her was the only unbelievability about this movie. She plays the stripper with all of the charm that she can deliver with gusto but one can see the weariness in her eyes and a longing to be somewhere else. Ram is on friendly terms with her as he is a frequent patron of the club and he gets to go slightly beyond the \\"don't socialize with the customers\\" line that she has set up for herself. She is raising a son and does not want anything to detract from her focus to make a better life for herself. It is demonstrated that she certainly has an exception for Ram in her heart, if not physically.<br /><br />Evan Rachel Wood is the estranged daughter with which Ram is desperately trying to regain contact with and she wants nothing to do with him. He was never there for her as is the life of a traveling wrestler. Ram has a heart attack at one of the shows and is told that if he wrestles again that he may die and now his need to mend fences with his daughter is more palpable than ever and produces one of the most emotional scenes in the film.<br /><br />Despite the specter of death, Ram is offered one last big match. It is a 20th anniversary match with an old nemesis of his played by Ernest Miller.Ram briefly retires as he tries to get his life back together and after being rebuffed by his daughter and Tomei he decides that the people are his family and he's willing to risk death (shortly after heart surgery) to get back in the ring. It's less about the occasion and more about the pride.<br /><br />I'll let the reader watch the movie for the rest of the plot. I will not give away the resolution in a review.<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky expertly directed this film in a documentary style which makes it feel more like a documentary about pro wrestling than any actual documentary on pro wrestling to date. The lighting, mood, pacing, and performances are first rate. It's directed and edited in such a way that there is no wasted moment or emotion, and the viewer feels it.<br /><br />For this reviewer a further compelling aspect of this film is what it is like when two people, a wrestler and a stripper, who are each someone different at their work than they are in real life, get to know each other outside of those settings. This dynamic produces the Aurora Borealis of character acting by Rourke and Tomei that ultimately make this picture the masterpiece that it is.<br /><br />I give this all five stars and will probably watch it repeatedly.<br />Kevin W.

0446401307|4.0|THE OVERLOOK may not be a great book but it is a great book for commuting which is where and how I read it, on my way to and from work. Connelly knows how to tell a good story and, let's face it, the guy can write. Because it is part of a popular series you're bound to find those who liked it better than others or conversely, didn't. Hey, we all have our favorites which is why Baskin & Robbins has more flavors than vanilla.<br />  I'm a Harry Bosch fan so I won't bad mouth the book especially when it is a well written piece of work with a good storyline. And come on! The Title, The Overlook? How fitting for a whodunnit where the evidence is there but overlooked.<br />  Got a plane trip coming or just taking the bus or train to and from work? Then pick up THE OVERLOOK and see if you can figure it out before you get to the final chapters or say, before the fat guy next to you falls asleep on your shoulder.
B00006IU73|5.0|on this piece of art. Excellent overall is all I can say. may even be better than 'Deadwing', which I didn't think was possible. This band is really special. I love this more rocked-out phase of their career over the more prog-ambient stuff of old. There is a real fresh vibe and the production is spectacular. Not to mention the musicianship.<br /><br />I will break this one down, which I don't do often. but each track has its own unique quality.<br /><br />Blackest Eyes - Great opener! Heavy, melodic and just gets it going perfect. 5/5<br /><br />Trains - Great acoustic vibe in this poppishly light yet very good track. 4/5<br /><br />Lips of Ashes - Nice vocal harmonies in this Floyd-ish styled piece. 4/5<br /><br />Sound of Muzak - One of the bands best out-right 'song' styled songs. Great drumming, toe tapping pace and harmonies galore. Perfect song. 5+/5<br /><br />Gravity Eyelids - Absolutely superb track. Hauntingly melodic and then increases to a Heavy as hell mid section. This track may annoy you at first, but give it time and it may become one of your all time favorite PT tracks. Super. 5+/5<br /><br />Weddding Nails - Kicks as* and fits well in the flow of the disc. Good riffs abound. Guitars galore. Instrumental. 4/5<br /><br />Prodigal - Again, very PT/Floyd-sh. Great, mesmerizing track that has excellent vocal harmonies. 4/5<br /><br />3 - Decent track. Ambient with a relaxing bass vibe. Like it, dont love it. Earlier fans may like it more. But again, helps the whole CD to gel. 3/5<br /><br />The Creator Has... - Awesome song. Great bass, vocal delivery and drumming on this super heavy track for PT. I would love to hear more from the band in this vein. Heavy and experimental. - 5+/5<br /><br />Heartattack in a lay by - Probably the least appealing track to me. Ok, but kind of drags in my opinion. Slow and a bit draggy. OK, but far from essential. - 3/5<br /><br />Strip the Soul - Decent track. Good bass line again lays the foundation. Somewhat prog yet straight forward. Sounds like they wanted to do a jam, but didn't quite make it. 3/5<br /><br />Collapse the Light into Earth - Ambient, orchestrated piece. Kind of slow and doesn't go too far. Not the best way to finish, older PT fans may like this sort of thing, but has a haunting keyboard sound I like and brings everything to a quiet halt. 3/5<br /><br />This disc takes more listens that 'Deadwing' but it excels at some points. Give it time and realize it does slow down a bit late.. But some of the tracks are downright awesome and must be heard a few times to appreciate, and they don't let go. They stick with you. The better tracks make up for some of the avg. tracks.<br /><br />Pick it up because it is essential for all Rock collections. Another musical journey worthy of attention.the Light into Earth - Ambient, orchestrated piece. Kind of slow and doesn't go too far.

1416905014|5.0|These intricate pop-ups are sure to delight anyone who still loves the Cinderella story, whether child or adult. In addition to the clever and meticulously engineered pop-ups (yes, the pumpkin actually turns into a 3-D coach), there are little pull-outs and other gadgets on the pages. It's not for little kids, who would not be able to treat it gently, but a lot of fun for everyone else.
B001JNND9W|3.0|I saw this film in the theater when it originally came out.  I've since seen it once on one of the movie channels.  I was enthused at the prospect of watching this intrigueing film on Blu-Ray with my new 52\\" HDTV and Blu-ray home theater system.  When it arrived, I open the box to watch it immediately!!!  Inside the box, there was an insert mentioning that the DVD was made to todays' best, exacting industry standards. It also mentioned it might not be compatible with my new Blu-Ray player.  I ignored the insert, popped it in the player only to find out that the insert was correct.  My player alerted me with a new (to me) \\"red screen of death\\"!!!  I learned a new term that day; \\"firmware upgrade\\".  Following the guidance on the insert I went to the information site on the web, found my players' manufacturers' site and followed their instructions for burning a CD to upgrade my players' firmware.  It didn't work!!!!!  So, having bought the player just three months earlier, I took it to the store associated with the \\"Geek Squad\\".  After two hours of trying, they determined that my player needed to go to the service center to be fixed so it WOULD be able to accept this and any future \\"firmware upgrades\\".  As the player is also the home theater portion of my entire system, I declined their offer to send ot to the service center for, oh, TWO TO THREE WEEKS!!!!  I'll wait until I have several movies that can't be played before I dismantle my home theater system for three weeks just to watch a movie I had anticipated enjoying.  Until then it can sit on the shelf and age.  Why three stars???  Even if the Blu-Ray version isn't all that I expected, it's still an interesting movie!!! JRB
B000777J2S|4.0|I purchased this CD because it reviewed well in Great Britain and because of the appearance of Antony and the Johnsons on David Letterman.  Their music is different and I enjoy that difference.  They all seem to be accomplished musicians, but I have mixed feelings about Antony's voice.  Some songs come across better than others.
1932907009|4.0|I liked this book. I think it's very helpful and a lot of the information is to the point. I've read and/or looked at other screen writing books and a lot of them are just so.... well... \\"wordy\\". I enjoy reading words (!!) but if I want to reference anything later, I want it to be quick. This book does just that, and I've found it really useful in writing my own screenplay.     Sure, Mr. Snyder seems a bit arrogant about his big sell, \\"Blank Check\\", and some might think he is under-qualified but he has to be making some money or else he couldn't be writing this book.     I've read some reviews that state he is only interested in films that made money and not about the arthouse films... Well.. I don't think he states that Arthouse films don't have artistic merit - but they don't make as much money. I think he's pretty clear that he's teaching the format for selling a screenplay, not art.     If that's what you're interested in, or curious about, this is a great book.

B001F9Y2CM|5.0|This boxed set was a treasure to find. Sure there was the drawback of the 10 discs having sleeves. But this is a \\"must have\\" for any ABBA fan, the sleeves are from Europe and have the songs listed for the European audience. The set covers all 9 albums (CDs) from ABBA's decade of stardom, along with a 10th disc that has some great songs (of which some of them were made for ABBA's 10th studio album, which never came to be). The 10th also has some of their songs in Swedish, which were actually part of the European albums, but not released in the US.  It was so much fun going back and listening (and remembering) the songs that ABBA so wonderfully done and very few have even tried to duplicate to any degree of success in the studios.
0312427999|4.0|Naomi Klein has written a 'must read' book. If you want to understand the last thirty years, DIGEST this book. As far as she goes, she deserves an 8 out of 5 stars. It is that good. (Though, I wanted to throw something about every five paragraphs. Be prepared to get angry at what you read.)     However, I am giving her work 4 stars because she refuses to go far enough. If you think of a squid or octopus, she has gone as far as identifying the tentacles (Milton Friedman's Chicago School policies, the World Bank and the IMF) and moving up to their attachment muscles (revolving-door political/corporate interests and intelligence agencies). She refuses to move into the central body. I am glad that I had already evaluated various levels of 'conspiracy theories' beyond her limits, in order to connect the dots as I read. I have not visited any website of hers, so I have no idea 'why' this limitation.    On the most basic 'semi-public' level, Ms. Klein never mentions the Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA), the  Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) [actually once in passing, about a paper], the Bilderbergers, Trilaterals, and all of the spin offs of these groups.     Next level up (beyond the public face above) are (upper level) Freemasonry, the Zionists, Illuminati-descendants, international banker families/groups, and other controllers. Beyond that, you get into David Icke territory.    ---    This book went to press in 2007. As such, it just missed the U.S. financial meltdown. Reading the following quote (remember, 2007 at the latest), I ask the Gentle Reader to ponder the U.S. situation as of the time I write, including the bankster bailouts. Phenomenally prescient, or maybe she is 'on' to the next scam...    p.87    \\"What [Orlando Letelier, Allende's former defense minister] could not know at the time [1976] was that Chile under Chicago School rule was offering a glimpse of the future of the global economy, a pattern that would repeat again and again, from Russia to South Africa to Argentina: an urban bubble of frenetic speculation and dubious accounting fueling superprofits and frantic consumerism, ringed by the ghostly factories and rotting infrastructure of a development past; roughly half the population excluded from the economy altogether; out-of-control corruption and cronyism; decimation of nationally owned small and medium-sized businesses; a huge transfer of wealth from public to private hands, followed by a huge transfer of private debts into public hands.\\"    ---    In the following quotes, I tried to give a flavor of the book. Believe me, I could have easily made it ten times longer. So many 'aha's' and new info. If you read it all (sorry), you will begin to understand what has been done to the world. (Remedies at the end...) Kudos to Ms. Klein for outstanding work!    (Bracketed info [ ] is for clarity.)    p.9    \\"I [N.K.] discovered that the idea of exploiting crisis and disaster has been the modus operandi of Milton Friedman's movement from the very beginning -- this fundamentalist form of capitalism has always needed disasters to advance.\\" Then, \\"Seen through the lens of this doctrine, the past thirty-five years look very different.\\"    \\"The three trademark demands -- privatization, government deregulation, and deep cuts to social spending -- tended to be extremely unpopular with citizens...\\"    p.11    \\"The bottom line is that while Friedman's economic model is capable of being partially imposed under democracy, authoritarian conditions are required for the implementation of its true vision. For economic shock therapy to be applied without restraint -- as it was in Chile in the seventies, China in the late eighties, Russia in the nineties and the U.S. after September 11, 2001 -- some sort of additional major collective trauma has always been required, one that either temporarily suspended democratic practices or blocked them entirely. This ideological crusade was born in the authoritarian regimes of South America, and in its largest newly conquered territories -- Russia and China -- it coexists most comfortably, and most profitably, with an iron-fisted leadership to this day.\\"    \\"When the September 11 attacks hit, the White House was packed with Friedman's disciples, including his close friend Donald Rumsfeld.\\"    p.14    \\"In the attempt to relate the history of the ideological crusade that has culminated in the radical privatization of war and disaster, one problem recurs: the ideology is a shape-shifter, forever changing its name and switching identities. Friedman called himself a 'liberal', but his U.S. followers, who associated liberals with high taxes and hippies, tended to identify as 'conservatives', 'classical economists', 'free marketers', and, later, as believers in 'Reaganomics' or 'laissez-faire'. In most of the world, their orthodoxy is known as 'neoliberalism', but it is often called 'free trade' or simply 'globalization'. Only since the mid-nineties has the intellectual movement, led by the right-wing think tanks with which Friedman had long associations -- Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, and the American Enterprise Institute -- called itself 'neoconservative', a worldview that has harnessed the full force of the U.S. military machine in the service of a corporate agenda.\\"    p.15    \\"All these incarnations share a commitment to the policy trinity -- the elimination of the public sphere, total liberation for corporations, and skeletal social spending -- but none of the various names for the ideology seem quite adequate. Friedman framed his movement as an attempt to free the market from the state, but the real-world track record of what happens when his purist vision is realized is rather different. In every country where Chicago School policies have been applied over the past three decades, what has emerged is a powerful ruling alliance between a few very large corporations and a class of mostly wealthy politicians -- with hazy and ever-shifting lines between the two groups. In Russia the billionaire private players in the alliance are called 'the oligarchs'; in China, 'the princelings'; in Chile, 'the piranhas'; in the U.S., the Bush-Cheney campaign 'Pioneers'. Far from freeing the market from the state, these political and corporate elites have simply merged, trading favors to secure the right to appropriate precious resources previously held in the public domain -- from Russia's oil fields, to China's collective lands, to the no-bid reconstruction contracts for work in Iraq.    \\"A more accurate term for a system that erases the boundaries between Big Government and Big Business is not liberal, conservative or capitalist but corporatist. Its main characteristics are huge transfers of public wealth to private hands, often accompanied by exploding debt, an ever-widening chasm between the dazzling rich and the disposable poor, and an aggressive nationalism that justifies bottomless spending on security. For those inside the bubble of extreme wealth created by such an arrangement, there can be no more profitable way to organize a society. But because of the obvious drawbacks for the vast majority of the population left outside the bubble, other features of the corporatist state tend to include aggressive surveillance (once again, with government and large corporations trading favors and contracts), mass incarceration, shrinking civil liberties, and often, though not always, torture.\\"    p.17    \\"In the torrent of words written in eulogy to Milton Friedman, the role of shocks and crises to advance his worldview received barely a mention. Instead, the economist's passing provided an occasion for a retelling of the official story of how his brand of radical capitalism became government orthodoxy in almost every corner of the globe. It is a fairy-tale version of history, scrubbed clean of all the violence and coercion so intimately entwined with this crusade, and it represents the single most successful propaganda coup of the past three decades.\\"    p.18    \\"This book is a challenge to the central and most cherished claim in the official story -- that the triumph of deregulated capitalism has been born of freedom, that unfettered free markets go hand in hand with democracy. Instead, I will show that this fundamentalist form of capitalism has consistently been midwifed by the most brutal forms of coercion, inflicted on the collective body politic as well as on countless individual bodies. The history of the contemporary free market -- better understood as the rise of corporatism -- was written in shocks.\\"    p.20    \\"But what of the contemporary crusade to liberate world markets? The coups, wars, and slaughters to install and maintain pro-corporate regimes have never been treated as capitalist crimes but have instead been written off as the excesses of overzealous dictators, as hot fronts of the Cold War, and now of the War on Terror. If the most committed opponents of the corporatist economic model are systematically eliminated, whether in Argentina in the seventies or in Iraq today, that suppression is explained as part of the dirty tight against Communism or terrorism -- almost never as the fight for the advancement of pure capitalism.\\"    \\"I am not arguing that all forms of market systems are inherently violent. It is eminently possible to have a market-based economy that requires no such brutality and demands no such ideological purity. A free market in consumer products can coexist with free public health care, with public schools, with a large segment of the economy -- like a national oil company -- held in state hands. It's equally possible to require corporations to pay decent wages, to respect the right of workers to form unions, and for governments to tax and redistribute wealth so that the sharp inequalities that mark the corporatist state are reduced. Markets need not he fundamentalist.\\"    \\"Keynes proposed exactly that kind of mixed, regulated economy after the Great Depression, a revolution in public policy that created the New Deal and transformations like it around the world. It was exactly that system of compromises, checks and balances that Friedman's counterrevolution was launched to methodically dismantle in country after country. Seen in that light, the Chicago School strain of capitalism does indeed have something in common with other dangerous ideologies: the signature desire for unattainable purity, for a clean slate on which to build a reengineered model society.\\"    p.80    'In that year and a half, many of [Chile]'s business elite had had their fill of the Chicago Boys' adventures in extreme capitalism. The only people benefiting were foreign companies and a small clique of financiers known as the 'piranhas', who were making a killing on speculation. The nuts-and-bolts manufacturers who had strongly supported the coup were getting wiped out.\\"    p.86    \\"It's clear that Chile never was the laboratory of 'pure' free markets that its cheerleaders claimed. Instead, it was a country where a small elite leapt from wealthy to super-rich in extremely short order -- a highly profitable formula bankrolled by debt and heavily subsidized (then bailed out) with public funds. When the hype and salesmanship behind the miracle are stripped away, Chile under Pinochet and the Chicago Boys was not a capitalist state featuring a liberated market but a corporatist one.\\"    \\"What Chile pioneered under Pinochet was an evolution of corporatism: a mutually supporting alliance between a police state and large corporations, joining forces to wage all-out war on the third power sector -- the workers -- thereby drastically increasing the alliance's share of the national wealth. That war -- what many Chileans understandably see as a war of the rich against the poor and middle class -- is the real story of Chile's economic 'miracle'.\\"    \\"By 1988, when the economy had stabilized and was growing rapidly, 45 percent of the populationhad fallen below the poverty line. The richest 10 percent of Chileans, however, had seen their incomes increase by 83 percent. Even in 2007, Chile remained one of the most unequal societies in the world -- out of 123 countries in which the United Nations tracks inequality Chile ranked 116th, making it the 8th most unequal country on the list.\\"    p.87    \\"In Chile, if you were outside the wealth bubble, the miracle looked like the Great Depression, but inside its airtight cocoon the profits flowed so free and fast that the easy wealth made possible by shock therapy-style \\"reforms\\" have been the crack cocaine of financial markets ever since.\\"    p.117    \\"Both [Milton] Friedman and Arnold Harberger gladly took credit for the economic miracles performed by their Latin American Chicago Boys. ... When it came to considering the human costs of the 'miracles' their students performed, however, both men suddenly saw no relationship.\\"    \\"[Milton Friedman] conveniently ignored the fact that the central hypothesis for which he was receiving the [1976 Nobel for Economics] prize was being graphically proven false by the breadlines, typhoid outbreaks and shuttered factories in Chile, the one regime ruthless enough to put his ideas into practice.\\"    p.118    \\"...it seemed as if, with the two Nobel prizes [Amnesty International won the Nobel Peace Prize], the most prestigious jury in the world had issued its verdict: the shock of the torture chamber was to be forcefully condemned, but economic shock treatments were to be applauded--and the two forms of shock were, as Lacher had written with dripping irony, 'entirely unrelated'. This intellectual firewall went up not only because Chicago School economists refused to acknowledge any connection between their policies and the use of terror. Contributing to the problem was the particular way that these acts of terror were hauled as narrow 'human rights abuses' rather than as tools that served clear political and economic ends.\\"    p.161    \\"Understandably unwilling to go to war with the Washington institutions that owned their debts, crisis-struck new democracies had little choice but to play by Washington's rules. And then, in the early eighties, Washington's rules got a great deal stricter. That's because the debt shock coincided precisely, and not coincidentally, with a new era in North-South relations, one that would make military dictatorships largely unnecessary. It was the dawn of the era of 'structural adjustment' -- otherwise known as the dictatorship of debt.\\"    p.162    \\"When countries were sent spiraling into crisis in the eighties, they had nowhere else to turn but the World Bank and the IMF. When they did, they hit a wall of orthodox Chicago Boys, trained to see their economic catastrophes not as problems to solve but as precious opportunities to leverage in order to secure a new free-market frontier. Crisis opportunism was now the guiding logic of the world's most powerful financial institutions. It was also a fundamental betrayal of their founding principles.\\"    \\"The World Bank and the IMF...were given the explicit mandate to prevent future economic shocks and crashes like the ones that had so destabilized Weimar Germany. The World Bank would make long-term investments in development to pull countries out of poverty, while the IMF would act as a kind of global shock absorber, promoting economic policies that reduced financial speculation and market volatility. When a country looked as though it was falling into crisis, the IMF would leap in with stabilizing grants and loans, thereby preventing crises before they occurred. The two institutions... would coordinate their responses. John Maynard Keynes, who headed the U.K. delegation, was convinced that the world had finally recognized the political perils of leaving the market to regulate itself.\\"    p.163    \\"The IMF and the World Bank ... allocated power ... on the size of each country's economy--an arrangement that gives the United States an effective veto over all major decisions, with Europe and Japan controlling most of the rest. That meant that when Reagan and Thatcher came to power in the eighties, their highly ideological administrations were essentially able to harness the two institutions for their own ends, rapidly increasing their power and turning them into the primary vehicles for the advancement of the corporatist crusade.\\"    \\"Officials with the World Bank and the IMF had always made policy recommendations when they handed out loans, but in the early eighties, emboldened by the desperation of developing countries, those recommendations morphed into radical free-market demands. When crisis-struck countries came to the IMF seeking debt relief and emergency loans, the fund responded with sweeping shock therapy programs, equivalent in scope to `The Brick\\" drafted by the Chicago Boys for Pinochet and the 220-law decree cooked up in Goth's living room in Bolivia. The IMF issued its first full-fledged 'structural adjustment' program in 1983. For the next two decades, every country that came to the fund for a major loan was informed that it needed to revamp its economy from top to bottom.\\"    p.164    \\"The principle was simple: countries in crisis desperately need emergency aid to stabilize their currencies. When privatization and free-trade policies are packaged together with a financial bailout, countries have little choice but to accept the whole package. The really clever part was that the economists themselves knew that free trade had nothing to do with ending a crisis, but that information was expertly 'obfuscated'.\\"    p.185    \\"The [Chinese Politburo] party wanted to open the economy to private ownership and consumerism while maintaining its own grip on power -- a plan that ensured that once the assets of the state were auctioned off, party officials and their relatives would snap up the best deals and be first in line for the biggest profits.\\"    p.224    \\"Like the Polishsupporters of Solidarity, 67 percent of Russians told pollsters in 1992 they believed workers' cooperatives were the most equitable way to privatize the assets of the Communist state, and 79 percent said they considered maintaining full employment to be a core function of government.\\"    \\"After only one year, shock therapy had taken a devastating toll: millions of middle-class Russians had lost their life savings when money lost its value, and abrupt cuts to subsidies meant millions of workers had not been paid in months. The average Russian consumed 40 percent less in 1992 than in 1991, and a third of the population fell below the poverty line.\\"    p.225    \\"Under pressure from voters, the country's elected parliament -- the same body that had supported Yeltsin's rise to power -- decided it was time to rein in the president and his ersatz Chicago Boys. In December 1992, they voted to unseat Yegor Gaidar, and three months later, in March 1993, the parliamentarians voted to repeal the special powers they had given to Yeltsin to impose his economic laws by decree. The grace period had expired, and the results were abysmal; from now on, laws had to go through parliament, a standard measure in any liberal democracy and following the procedures set out in Russia's constitution.\\"    \\"[Yeltsin] retaliated against the parliament's 'mutiny' by going on television and declaring a state of emergency, which conveniently restored his imperial powers. Three days later, Russia's independent Constitutional Court (the creation of which was one of Gorbachev's most significant democratic breakthroughs) ruled 9-3 that Yeltsin's power grab violated, on eight different counts, the constitution he had sworn to uphold.\\"    \\"Until this point, it had still been possible to present 'economic reform' and democratic reform as part of the same project in Russia. But once Yeltsin declared a state of emergency, the two projects were on a collision course, with Yeltsin and his shock therapists in direct opposition to the elected parliament and the constitution. Nevertheless, the West threw its weight behind Yeltsin...\\"    p.226    \\"In the spring of 1993, the collision drew closer when parliament brought forward a budget bill that did not follow IMF demands for strict austerity. Yeltsin responded by trying to eliminate the parliament.\\"    \\"...Yeltsin, confident that he had the West's support, took his first irreversible step toward what was now being openly referred to as the 'Pinochet option': he issued decree 1400, announcing that the constitution was abolished and parliament dissolved. Two days later, a special session of parliament voted 636-2 to impeach Yeltsin for this outrageous act (the equivalent of the U.S. president unilaterally dissolving Congress)... Some kind of armed conflict between Yeltsin and the parliament was now inevitable.\\"    p.227    \\"After they witnessed Solidarity get pounded at the polls, it was obvious to Yeltsin and his Western advisers that early elections were far too risky. In Russia, too much wealth hung in the balance: huge oil fields, about 30 percent of the world's natural gas reserves, 20 percent of its nickel, not to mention weapons factories and the state media apparatus with which the Communist Party had controlled the vast population. Yeltsin abandoned negotiations and moved into war posture.\\"    p.228    \\"A clear signal from Washington or the EU could have forced Yeltsin to engage in serious negotiations with the parliamentarians, but he received only encouragement. Finally, on the morning of October 4, 1993, Yeltsin fulfilled his long-prescribed destiny and became Russia's very own Pinochet...\\"    p.229    \\"But Russia wasn't a repeat of Chile -- it was Chile in reverse order: Pinochet staged a coup, dissolved the institutions of democracy and then imposed shock therapy; Yeltsin imposed shock therapy in a democracy, then could defend it only by dissolving democracy and staging a coup. Both scenarios earned enthusiasticsupport from the West.\\"    p.230    \\"Following the coup, Russia was under unchecked dictatorial rule: its elected bodies were dissolved, the Constitutional Court was suspended, as was the constitution; tanks patrolled the streets, a curfew was in effect, and the press faced pervasive censorship, though civil liberties were soon restored. So what did the Chicago Boys and their Western advisers do at this critical moment: ...liberated from the meddling of democracy, they went on a law-making binge.\\"    \\"With the country reeling from the attack, Yeltsin's own Chicago Boys rammed through the most contentious measures in their program: huge budget cuts, the removal of price controls on basic food items, including bread, and even more and faster privatizations -- the standard policies that cause so much instant misery that they seem to require a police state to stave off rebellion.\\"    p.231    \\"In theory, all this wheeling and dealing was supposed to create the economic boom that would lift Russia out of desperation; in practice, the Communist state was simply replaced with a corporatist one: the beneficiaries of the boom were confined to a small club of Russians, many of them former Communist Party apparatchiks, and a handful of Western mutual fund managers who made dizzying returns investing in newly privatized Russian companies. A clique of nouveaux billionaires, many of whom were to become part of the group universally known as 'the oligarchs\\" for their imperial levels of wealth and power, teamed up with Yeltsin's Chicago Boys and stripped the country of nearly everything of value, moving the enormous profits offshore at a rate of $2 billion a month.\\"    p.233    \\"The scandal wasn't just that Russia's public riches were auctioned off for a fraction of their worth -- it was also that, in true corporatist style, they were purchased with public money. As the Moscow Times journalists Matt Bivens and Joitas Bernstein put it, 'a few hand-picked men took over Russia's state-developed oil fields for free, as part of a giant shell game in which one arm of government paid another arm.' In a bold act of cooperation between the politicians selling the public companies and the businessmen buying them, several of Yeltsin's ministers transferred large sums of public money, which should have gone into the national bank or treasury, into private banks that had been hastily incorporated by oligarchs. (The two major oligarch-connected banks were Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Bank Menatep and Vladimir Potanin's Uneximbank.) The state then contracted with the same banks to run the privatization auctions for the oil fields and mines. The banks ran the auctions, but they also bid in them -- and sure enough, the oligarch-owned banks decided to make themselves the proud new owners of the previously public assets. The money that they put up to buy the shares in these public companies was likely the same public money that Yeltsin's ministers had deposited with them earlier. In other words, the Russian people fronted the money for the looting of their own country.\\"    p.441    \\"...as a business prospectus to the nascent disaster capitalism complex...winning [a war] is not the point. The point is to create 'security' inside fortress states bolstered by endless low-level conflict outside their walls. In a way, it is the same goal that the private security companies have in Iraq: secure the perimeter, protect the principal. Baghdad, New Orleans and Sandy Springs provide glimpses of a kind of gated future built and run by the disaster capitalism complex.\\"    \\"It is in Israel, however, that this process is most advanced: an entire country has turned itself into a fortified gated community, surrounded by locked-out people living in permanently excluded red zones. This is what a society looks like when it has lost its economic incentive for peace and is heavily invested in fighting and profiting from an endless and unwinnable War on Terror. One part looks like Israel;the other part looks like Gaza.\\"    \\"Israel's case is extreme, but the kind of society it is creating may not be unique. The disaster capitalism complex thrives in conditions of low-intensity grinding conflict...\\"    p.442    \\"This discarding of 25 to 60 percent of the population has been the hallmark of the Chicago School crusade since the 'misery villages' began mushrooming throughout the Southern Cone [southern South America] in the seventies. In South Africa, Russia, and New Orleans the rich build walls around themselves. Israel has taken this disposal process a step further: it has built walls around the dangerous poor.\\"    p.448    \\"The powerful rejection of what the French call 'savage capitalism'...\\"    p.450    \\"Despite the Bush administration's claim that the twentieth century ended with a 'decisive victory' for free markets over all forms of socialism, many Latin Americans understand perfectly well that it was authoritarian communism that failed in Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. Democratic socialism, meaning not only socialist parties brought to power through elections but also democratically run workplaces and land holdings, has worked in many regions, from Scandinavia to the thriving and historic cooperative economy in Italy's Emilia-Romagna region.\\"    \\"The dirty secret of the neoliberal [in U.S. lingo, neoconservative] era is that these ideas were never defeated in a great battle of ideas, nor were they voted down in elections. They were shocked out of the way at key political junctures. When resistance was fierce, they were defeated with overt violence...\\"    p.451    \\"It is precisely because the dream of economic equality is so popular, and so difficult to defeat in a fair fight, that the shock doctrine was embraced in the first place.\\"    p.453    \\"...Latin America's contemporary movements are not direct replicas of their predecessors. Of all the differences, the most striking is an acute awareness of the need for protection from the shocks ofthe past -- the coups, the foreign shock therapists, the U.S.-trained torturers, as well as the debt shocks and currency collapses of the eighties and nineties. Latin America's mass movements, which have powered the wave of election victories for left-wing candidates, are learning how to build shock absorbers into their organizing models. They are, for example, less centralized than in the sixties, making it harder to demobilize whole movements by eliminating a few leaders.\\"    p.454    \\"Latin America's new leaders are also taking bold measures to block any future U.S.-backed coups that could attempt to undermine their democratic victories.\\"    \\"The new leaders in Latin America are also becoming better prepared for the kinds of shocks inflicted by volatile markets. One of the most destabilizing forces of recent decades has been the speed with which capital can pick up and move, or how a sudden drop in commodity prices can devastate an entire agricultural sector. But in much of Latin America these shocks have already happened, leaving behind ghostly industrial suburbs and huge stretches of fallow farmland. The task of the region's new left, therefore, has become a matter of taking the detritus of globalization and putting it back to work. For the [democratically-run Argentina business] cooperatives, there is no fear of facing an economic shock of investors leaving, because the investors have already left.\\"    p.455    \\"...rather than auctioning off pieces of the state to large corporations and losing democratic control, the people who use the resources are given the power to manage them, creating, at least in theory, both jobs and more responsive public services.\\"    p.456    \\"Latin America's most significant protection from future shocks (and therefore from the shock doctrine) flows from the continent's emerging independence from Washington's financial institutions, the result of greater integration among regional governments. The Bolivian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) is the continent's retort to the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the now buried corporatist dream of a free-trade zone stretching from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Though ALBA is still in its early stages, Emir Sader, the Brazil-based sociologist, describes its promise as 'a perfect example of genuinely fair trade: each country provides what it is best placed to produce, in return for what it most needs, independent of global market prices.' So Bolivia provides gas at stable discounted prices; Venezuela offers heavily subsidized oil to poorer countries and shares expertise in developing reserves; and Cuba sends thousands of doctors to deliver free health care all over the Continent, while training students from other countries at its medical schools.     \\"...the major benefit is that ALBA is essentially a barter system, in which countries decide for themselves what any given commodity or service is worth, rather than letting traders in New York, Chicago or London set the prices for them. That makes trade far less vulnerable to the kind of sudden price fluctuations that devastated Latin American economies in the recent past. Surrounded by turbulent financial waters, Latin America is creating a zone of relative economic calm and predictability, a feat presumed impossible in the globalization era.\\"    \\"When one country does face a financial shortfall, this increased integration means that it does not need to turn to the IMF or the U.S. Treasury for a bailout. That's fortunate because the 2006 U.S. National Security Strategy makes it clear that for Washington, the shock doctrine is still very much alive...\\"    p.457    \\"...Venezuela has emerged as a major lender to other developing countries, allowing them to do an end run around Washington. The results have been dramatic. Brazil, so long shackled to Washington by its enormous debt, is refusing to enter into a new agreement with the IMF, Nicaragua is negotiating to quit the fund, Venezuela has withdrawn from both the IMF and the World Bank, and even Argentina, Washington's former \\"model pupil,\\" has been part of the trend.\\"    \\"'There is life after the IMF,' [Argentina President Nestor] Kirchner declared, 'and it's a good life.'\\"    \\"The IMF, a pariah in so many countries where it has treated crises as profit-making opportunities, is starting to wither away. The World Bank faces an equally grim future.\\"
0316017922|2.0|I really enjoyed Mr. Gladwell's other books and I had that level of expectation for this one.  There is some very interesting information and different ways of interpreting what his really behind success.  However, the chapters seem very disjointed.  Different viewpoints are expressed in each chapter but they are not brought together for a final overview of what we should learn.  The last few paragraphs in the next-to-last chapter (Marita's Bargain) does take a \\"The lesson here is very simple\\" approach, but it is only two paragraphs.  The editor should have insisted on a much more thorough conclusion.
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|Wanted isn't going to inspire you like Spider-man, or blow your mind like Watchmen or The Dark Knight, but its a whole lot of fun.  James McAvoy is an amazing actor through his expressions.  He makes a believable character for all of us and most of us in the theater really related to Wesley.  With this great character, whom the audience connects with, and a new stylist action tone, you come together at a very entertaining film.<br /><br />I reccomend at least seeing this, however owning it gave me great satisfaction.  The special features were entertaining for the most part, and I'm enjoying watching the film on Blu-ray more than one time.  The U-control feature that I utilized earlier on The Incredible Hulk disc, needs a little revising, In my opinion, because I don't want to have to rewind and select another button to see my behind-the-scenes clips.  Other than that the Blu-ray version seems to be very purchasable.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this movie for: Jolie, Freeman, McAvoy, the action, the less-CGI stunts, the bullet curving, and much more....
B001NOMNZW|5.0|I love this movie--as I do all of them--but I think this is the best one.  The songs are really good!!
B001ED7C5I|4.0|I am a Tracy Chapman fan.  I have every cd she has released and I read the reviews before purchasing this cd.  i didn't know what to expect.  I have to say, the second song, \\"I Did It All\\" is probably, for me, the most annoying song she has ever written- I must fast forward through it every time.  I definitely do agree it's very melodic without much shift in tempo throughout the cd.  I played it several times in my car just to see if some songs stuck.  There are definitely some good songs and some great choruses in the cd.  It definitely does not compare to some of her cds from the past but this is a good cd.  There are reviews that say it's too religious.  Tracy has always put religion and respect for the Earth and our surroundings in every cd but i wouldn't say it's more than \\"Before Easter\\" for example.  So in the end I just recommend having it in your collection if you are a true Tracy Chapman fan.
B000063DI8|2.0|The worst Iron Maiden album in my opinion but there are a few fantastic tracks amongst the anguish. Tailgunner, Prayer, Run Silent., Mother Russia are all very good but the band lost its focus after the huge tours for all those years. Adrian had left and Bruce would also leave after Fear of the Dark. Still its a must to own for those tracks I mentioned above but clearly the guys were not entirely focused on this album.
B001N26GHU|5.0|Long time Bruce fan, and I love this album.  Beautiful sounds in Bruce's voice, and he's trying some newer styles of music in some songs.    Fave songs:  My Lucky Day, The Last Carnival, Surprise Surprise, and Working on a Dream.
B001UOVP1S|1.0|Bluuuuch!  Baaaaarf!  Gaaaaaack!  If you are into synths, drum machines and click tracks, this disc is 4 U.  No acoustic instruments or Fender Stratocasters were harmed during the recording of this record.  This is a total 180 from Soundgarden or Audioslave.  If you liked those discs, U wont like this 1.
B001LRJH0U|3.0|Ed Harris, Viggo Mortenson, and Jeremy Irons ... all struck me as ideal types to play Western characters, and each does a good job here.  The story is classic Western: Bragg, a ruthless and lawless gang leader terrorizes the town of Appaloosa, making it impossible for the locals to mine the local copper.  After Bragg brazenly kills the local sherrif, the town leaders decide to hire a couple of gunslingers and put them in charge of the law.  The only problem was a fickle woman, who threatened to come between them, but more importantly weakened the resolve of the more experienced of the two by giving him something to care about.<br /><br />The elements are all there ... I just didn't feel this Western went anywhere further than telling a fairly engaging story.  The voiceover by Viggo Mortenson felt unnecessary to me, and merely established that his was the point of view from which the story would be told, but I never felt a strong sense of what made him tick, other than a sense of loyalty to his partner.  The story looks good, but it felt to me too much like a Hollywood film, the town too much like a set, the children too much like modern kids dressed up to look like kids from the olden days, Zellwegger's character felt too much like Rene Zellwegger playing a fickle lady from the past, whose tendency to happilly cling to whatever man happened to be in charge struck me as overly pronounced, and Harris's tendency to stumble on big words and ask his younger partner for clarification felt like it was just one of those ticks written into a character to give him \\"salt\\" rather than something that felt real and as if it flowed organically from his character.  In short, this is a passable Western, and like a lot of old Westerns it creates an imperfect illusion of frontier life that is good enough for a couple of hours but doesn't have a timeless feel and doesn't feel like something that needed to be made.  Entertaining enough, but not even really comparable with the truly great Westerns like [[ASIN:6304696566 The Searchers]] or [[ASIN:0792163710 Shane]] or [[ASIN:B0000AUHPG Once Upon a Time in the West]] or even much more recent Western classics such as [[ASIN:B000GIW9I2 The Proposition]] or [[ASIN:B0010DR4BO The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]].  If you haven't seen those, definitely see them first.  If you've seen 'em all and can't get enough (like me), you should like this one well enough.erns like [[ASIN:6304696566 The Searchers]] or [[ASIN:0792163710 Shane]] or [[ASIN:B0000AUHPG Once Upon a Time in the West]] or even much more recent Western classics such as [[ASIN:B000GIW9I2 The Proposition]] or [[ASIN:B0010DR4BO The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]].

B001PPGAIA|4.0|Wow. This movie was great but took way too long. If you go into this movie expecting a two hour and fourty five minute movie then you will enjoy this thoroughly. When I saw this movie in theatres, I was not expecting this long of a movie. So, I found the movie at first to be terribly boring and long. But, after I got a chance to think about it, I realized how great this movie is. One of the things you have to realize is this really is Australia part one and two. Just when you think the movie is going to end it continues with the next story. The character development is great. I thought that the actors interactions with each other during the film were excellent also. Overall this movie was interesting, but probably needed to be two movies.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|This reunion yields one of the most emotive moments in rock'n'roll history.<br />Almost forty years after their Blind Faith gig at Hyde Park, this shows made sigh lots of souls over the world. It's a must for anyone who love classic rock.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|I love, love, love this movie and especially the lead character. Everything is perfect. Flawlessly beautiful setting, real characters, crisp acting. Best of all is Robin Hood, of course. A fascinating fighter, friend, lover, and man. Why can't they make movies like this anymore?
B000069HZP|1.0|First of all, \\"The Game\\" is an awesome and exciting thriller of a movie. I highly recommend checking it out.     However..I purchased this movie for a hearing impaired relative of mine based on the fact that Amazon's Product Details description CLEARLY states..    Subtitles: English, Spanish.     There are in fact NO English subtitles, but only Spanish. And my relative now has a movie that is totally useless to her!    I think Amazon needs to print their product details based on correct facts so that other buyers won't make the same misinformed mistake.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I think this is one of the best animated films ever made. Considering when it was made it may be one of films greatest achievements. Not even Snow White has the detail, texture and range that this one does. Maybe none of them do. To me this is the one that Disney himself had his fingerprints all over in every way. It comes right after Snow White which changed the game and gave the confidence to go further. And it comes before thing like the war, television projects and the theme park got more and more of his time.
B001P1FZDK|1.0|WAY over-hyped... If you like REPETITIVE noise over and over or maybe if you live in TETRIS world this album is awesome, otherwise, check out Strawberry Jam a much better album in my opinion with a little more to it
B001IAOEXU|3.0|I read the rave reviews on these before I purchased and was very excited to modify my old controllers.  They do feel nice, but I am a little harder on my controllers while playing NHL 09 and these will pop off.  The hook underneath and snap over the top of the L2 and R2 buttons, so if you are playing a game where you press these buttons harder than normal then they will pop off.  If not, get them, you will like 'em!
1433502437|5.0|I have used at least four other  study bibles. The ESV is far and away the most jam-packed with notes and full color supplements of them all. If you are going to pick just one, this is it.  The premium calf skin leather makes it an extra treat to enjoy. The soft supple leather hearkens back to the lovely bibles I can recall my grandparents using.  Highly recommended.
B00005JPNY|4.0|I think the only reason that this film was not more successful in the U.S. is because the books were not as well known as in England. The movie is exciting and well made on every level. The 2 disc set is the only way to go because the special features are exactly what real movie buffs have grown to expect. Hope they make the sequel.
B000007U6V|5.0|Maybe it's because I'd come back to the states from Germany, being an army brat, back in the mid-70's but to hear Autobahn being played in Kentucky pool halls was just a bit surreal.  I've always enjoyed this album, even here in 2009; so for an album to be listened to for over 30 years there really is something to it.  Some will say the title track is the whole album and the other songs aren't worth listening to - but I differ on that opinion in that each track has something to offer and as is so true in life, sometimes the best things come in small packages - sometimes the best music is the smaller tracks.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Nobody I know gets really excited about Bond films nowadays. Quantum of Solace is like most bond films: technically very good, halfway decent plot, decent acting and a slm-bang ending. This film meets all the expected Bond film requirements.      I like Daniel Craig - he is a very good actor that brings a level of maturity to the role. The clever title (read: \\"Small Comfort\\") refers to Bond's quest to avenge the death of his lover in the first film. He's after the people who gave the orders, not just the people directly responsible. This leads him to bust up a scheme by an Illuminati-esque group of businessmen to control a major natural resource.     There is alot to like about this film, the cinematography is great, there are some interesting action sequences and car chases. But where are the gadgets? No car gadgets, no watch/lighter/gun gadgets. There is one tricked-out phone in the movie, but it is not that spectacular; I guess the producerrs are moving away from that Bond movie staple.     Quantum of Solace is a pretty good film, better than most, but there is nothing really special about it.
B001PPF11M|4.0|First off- when it was announced that EMI was going to be repackaging more Radiohead, presumably only to profit off a former artist with a rich back catalog, I decided I would not be purchasing anything.  Once the track listing came out and all b-sides and demos from the respective era would be included, I was sold.    That said, in my mind, \\"Pablo Honey\\" was always the weakest album by the band.  I may have grown up with it, and taken on it's own is quite good, but pales in comparison to later Radiohead output notably \\"Ok Computer\\" or \\"Kid A\\".  Listening to this colleciton has certainly changed my opinion.  The album itself is on disc one.  I have noticed some people saying these reissues aren't remastered, but they are.  (Again, it doesn't say it anywhere on the packaging about remastering, but trust me- when played next to the 1993 issue of the CD, it is night and day).  You will notice things that were never clear before (particularly, for me, at the end of \\"Blow Out\\" when the feedback guitar fades in and up over the band- it has never been more intense!) brought to the forefront.  Of course, the negative to this is, having gotten used to the original mixes and sound, it isn't how it's \\"supposed\\" to sound, but alas, that is what happens with remasters.    Disc 2 is great because it collects everything else from the 1992-93 era of the band that had appeared on import CD's and demos, as well as a few BBC live cuts.  Nothing here will blow you away, but it fills in Radiohead's history quite nicely (the demo version of \\"Thinking About You\\" is punk-ish, a far cry from what it would develop into).  For a completist, just tracking down these songs would cost way more than what this 2CD set is going for, so kudos there.  And it comes in a nice digipack case that is pretty faithful to the original art.    I have 2 problems with the set though- 1. on disc 1, it doesn't have the \\"hidden\\" track of \\"Creep (Radio Edit)\\" that appeared on the 1993 version.  Small gripe, yes, Iknow considering the better version is already there, but, when you are used to it, why remove it?  The song obviously fits on the CD time-wise.  Makes no sense. And 2. The booklet is just a reprint of the original, but on flimsy paper- not the heavier cardstock like the original (they really skimped for the whole series in this regard).  The information on the b-sides is kind of lacking and more pictures or a summary would have been nice, but that's getting too greedy.    Overall, this is a worthwhile purchase if you are a Radiohead freak like myself who didn't have all of these B-sides and wants them all in one place and you want to hear a sonically superior version of the proper record.  If you are new to the band, this is a neat little collection, but not necessary- you can save ten bucks and get the original version.  EMI, in general, did a good job repackaging the material, and helped me appreciate the early days of Radiohead a bit more than before.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|We all know the movie, but it is still a must have for any Disney or movie fan. I live for commentary on the DVD. This by far is one of the best because it is provided by Walt Disney himself. Taken from interviews over a 25 year period we listen to one of the most influential producers and businessmen that ever lived. The second DVD has some of the best background info ever compiled about a film. The only DVD product that has more information on the man himself is called Walt:The Man behind the Myth.

B001N18HP0|5.0|This review is in reference to the VINYL set ONLY!    Where do I start? WOW. An amazing pressing.  Two heavy-duty 180 gram records. A heavy gatefold cardstock sleeve.  New pictures to dress up the inside, accompanied by the lyrics and detailed liner notes.    As for the music- record 1- you know what you're getting- the classic record, remastered for it's 20th anniversary.  Nothing else needs to be said.  The second disc (aka Ten Redux) is quite astonishing.  The recordings are stripped of the layers of reverb and cheesy early 90's sounds to reveal the power of the songs.  Guitars are panned and spaced out, so you can distinctly hear the parts (Mike is a god), the drums have more presence instead of being lost in reverb, and the bass punches through to reveal Jeff Ament's highly underrated playing.  Eddie's vocals are so intimate- it feels he's in the room singing to you. The mixes also reveal alot of secondary vocal tracks that are now brought to the forefront for added effect.    Honestly, the new mixes are likely to be the new way I listen to \\"Ten\\"- they are that good! (and this is coming from someone who has heard the original pressing a few hundred times, dating back to '92 when I first bought it on cassette!) Seriously, this is the way to go- if you're on the fence, get this, it will NOT dissapoint (besides- whatever your opinion on the remixes, you'll be owning Ten, the original version, on vinyl)     And to anyone who is complaining in these reviews about the \\"Redux\\" version- this isn't some money making scheme to push the same product on us- this is a band who HATED the original mixes (see Jeff's recent interview in Rolling Stone for full details) and commisioned their producer to fix the record- to give it a more immediate, less polished feel.  No, it's not what you grew up with, but that's the point.  And that's why you get BOTH versions here.    Viva la vinyl!
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Great Movie at a great price.  This is an epic story and Amazon got it to me without any loose or scratched discs.  Movies were in Perfect condition!
2352500796|5.0|More of an addendum to the first book by the author, it contains everything the author forgot to put in the first along with some new stuff found.

This is also my favorite Yes lineup:  Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Rick Wakeman, Steve Howe, and Alan White.

B001N18HOQ|5.0|Pearl Jam are fans fans. They really know what they are doing. Their packaging is always impressive. I'm looking forward to Vitalogy and Yield being re-issued. Not too sure about Binaural because it doesn't need it. Yield does and No code. Anyway, love this band.
B001PPLIFU|1.0|It is tragic to see bond turned into just another Jason Straham movie. While I loved transporter I would never consider it a Bond. Long gone are the days were bond was classy, classically handsome, smooth, and able to maintain it all while being deadly. Hopefully in a few years they will have a good actor playing bond, and hopefully some better writers too.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Let's take some Rush, some Yes and add in a little Zeppelin,then let's add a  little Iron maiden, Mettallica and some Sabbath. Then add in a pound of great musical talent and a pound of creativity. Let's stir it all together and give it  a nice 70s progressive concept albumn feel. And what do get? You get the brilliant work of art Crack the Skye by the great Mastodon. Having grown up in the 70s I thought this kind of great music was long gone. This albumn is truly a work of art. Call it metal or prog rock whatever. I call it some of the best Rock music I have ever heard and I've been a die hard Rush fan for 30 years.It's great to see bands like Mastodon emerging that have the guts and the awesome talent to make music of this caliber. I hope it's a trend thats here to stay. MASTODON ROCKS!
0553278223|5.0|The shipping was a little slow, more than 5 days. So you should order well in advance if you need this or another book for a class. They apologized for the being late though. The book looks great, no markings, I'm happy with it.I would order from them again.
B000ADWDF2|1.0|Have purchased two separate dvds of this movie from two different Amazon sellers. There are 3 language subtitle choices, English (of course) is one of them. My remote will underline French & Spanish - and the subtitles will operate. The 'English' choice - this choice 'cannot be underlined' = therefore does not operate. It is not my player ! I have two German movies, the English subtitles work for them. Just mentioning this fact in case anyone is interested ? And, I'm scratching my head because - none of the above 18 reviewers have had this problem. My dvd player is a TOSHIBA HD ... less than a year old, works fine on every other dvd I own.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I used to watch this movie on VHS and now my daughter watches it; it is funny to watch her expressions; She scratched it up from her and her best friend Karen watching it over and over.

0385339682|4.0|This was the first Grisham book I ever read, and I have since read two others, The Firm and The Street Lawyer. The Last Juror has really engaging characters, a likable narrative voice, and a meaningful story that seems realistic and held my interest all the way. This is very good, carefully crafted writing throughout. Unfortunately, The Grisham books I read afterwards are linear, one-dimensional, boring, and give the impression of being carelessly written.  The Last Juror is several cuts above the usual Grisham fare, if Street Lawyer and The Firm are any indication.
1586217194|4.0|I got this as a gift for my husband.  He likes listening to the CD's while driving to work. He really liked the information given in the audio book, which is word for word with what the book says.
B001DJLCPO|3.0|I like all things Neil Gaiman, but didn't read this one before seeing the movie. Usually movies never live up to the book. This was not a bad movie, I just think it could have been better with a different Director or Actors, or maybe a bigger budget? the story is great.
B001KEGRCA|5.0|I originally saw this movie in an IMAX Theater and was blown away by the entire production.  The views, the sound, and the narrative are truly fantastic.  This is still true for the BRD version.  I watch this disc almost daily and I can't get enough of it.  If you like the BBC Planet Earth discs, you'll surely love the Grand Canyon Adventure.  The Dave Matthews Band soundtrack rocks too!

B001PPLIEG|4.0|\\"Quantum of Solace\\" was a Bond movie in the traditional mould, but with a twist; gestures to social conscience.<br /><br />As a Bond movie, it was good, but not likely to be mentioned in the same breath as [[ASIN:B000NIBUR6 The Man With The Golden Gun]], [[ASIN:B001EDVNNU Die Another Day]], or even [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]].  Bond follows a series of leads to a previously unknown organization, and collaborates with a beautiful lady who has infiltrated the organization to pursue her own agenda.  Chases in cars, motorcycles, planes, and boats, gunfights, explosions, the usual, but executed to a high standard.<br /><br />The twist; a lot more of footage clearly intended to portray the uglier side of the third world rather than the glamorous locations featured in earlier Bond flicks.  Consistent with this theme, references were made to sleazier dealings by Bond's bosses and allies, along with a human scaled villain who was building a cabal to inflict suffering (for a profit) on the prolitariat rather than the bourgousie.<br /><br />I'm sure much will be made of this attempt to place a social message in a Bond movie along side the usual product placement for Omega and Aston Martin.  It didn't do much for me.  If anything, it was slightly distracting from an otherwise passable story and excellent action.<br /><br />I liked it, but didn't love it.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court
6305882592|5.0|The screenplay (get it online) includes essential scenes which were unforgivably expunged from the film, which will salve the ire of the more critical viewer who will construe much of Maude's irresponsible, selfish, childish conduct as an affront to her age and situation, eg. if you've ever had anything stolen from you, you know that Maude's stealing people's cars is the epitome of anti-life for the ordinary citizen. However, the existential element required to make sense of this behaviour is provided by the Sisyphean character, Glaucus (only fleetingly seen in the film), who every day starts carving an ice statue of Venus, which melts when he falls asleep, and every day he starts anew with the same unbounded joy. In my view, Glaucus is the binding agent for the story. Watch the film, read the screenplay, and prepare to be dazzled.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|WARNING:  Contains spoilers, most of which are mild.     This movie continues directly after \\"Casino Royale\\" (2006).      \\"Casino Royale\\" was near perfection, in revitalizing a series made ultra-campy by Daniel Craig's predecessor.  Highly recommended...    Then comes \\"Quantum of Solace\\" (QoS).    It starts with a big, exciting car chase.  Until you know which car Bond is in do you not know who's doing what and why.  Fortunately, we get to see Bond's face before it's all over...    Then comes the title song for the opening credits.  It was awkward on initial viewing, but has grown on me since.  Still, the tone of the music is a little off-kilter.    Then we get a set-up for what is the best action scene in the movie.  I won't spoil it, except this parallels \\"Casino Royale\\"'s post-opening credits in terms of intensity.  It works.  Unfortunately, that's when the movie starts to lose focus...    The movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to do.  Is it going to address Bond's wild emotional state and desire for revenge?  Is it going to address fighting a secret terrorist organization?  Is it going to give us big reasons to loathe the villain?  No.  It meanders around these things, but with varied direction that clearly has a bias toward the action scenes when compared to the plot exposition, which suffers greatly.    The terrorist organization has ensured a bunch of people are constantly dying of thirst.  The problem is, this isn't adequately conveyed to the audience.  As is Bond's vengeance for Vesper, as is the villain's lack of presence, et cetera, et cetera.    The terrorist organization, and even the good guys, do things when not saying dialogue that what's going on isn't about \\"good or evil\\", but \\"out of necessity\\".  It's amoral, if not devolved in scope.  The point of \\"Bond\\" is that he himself will do some not-so-good things from time to time to save the day... or himself.  The movie seems more preoccupied with topical issues such as \\"green technology\\" and \\"peak oil\\" than it is trying to BE a Bond movie.    In the movie's defence, people say the new Bond is a copy of the Bourne series.  At the time, people were saying Bourne was copying Bond.  Given that the Craig era is trying to be more like the original Bond books, Bourne is still the bigger copycat.    And some people say \\"Quantum\\" had a lot of comedic elements.  Not true.  There's a lot of black comedy or macabre wit (e.g. Bond making a stinging comment toward the guy he had stashed in the car boot when opening it to let him out), but any real ha-ha moments?  Don't look for them here.  Fortunately.  The more serious aspect, laced with dark humor, is great to have and it sets Craig's era amongst the best in the Bond series.    But I do miss Money Penny, and I do miss Q.    And as \\"Casino Royale\\" proved, I also miss a coherent storyline to make the action scenes that much more poignant even more.    Ultimately, the action scenes kept my attention and are truly wonderful.  The actual plot...  unfocused and ultimately inconsequential...  so many missed opportunities.    I hope the next Bond movie is along the lines of \\"Casino Royale\\" for its writing, with the level of wit in \\"Quantum\\", and done by a more seasoned director.  What was made was excellent... as a first draft.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've tried one other gameboard (Belkin n52te), and thought that it was great. The one thing I didn't like about it was the digital thumbstick and the fact that it didn't depress to act as a button. Enter the Logitech G13. This thing pretty much saved the day, once I got my hand(s) on it.<br /><br />To start off with, it's a lot bigger than the n53te, so make sure you have enough room for it. With my mouse, keyboard, and the G13 all taking up space on the slide-out keyboard shelf of my computer desk, I find that the G13 and keyboard have to fight for their turn to have focus. There's simply not enough room to have them all laid out next to one another. The nice thing about this, though, is that other than typing out text, the G13 replaces every single keystroke I'd ever use on the keyboard for controlling games.<br /><br />Speaking of games, I am an avid MMORPG junkie. I play Warhammer Online (my MMORPG de jour for now) every chance I get and for many hours at a time. That's what lead me on my journey to find a better way of rapidly executing the various abilities my characters have. A simple game controller wouldn't suffice, since there are simply way too many abilities that need to be mapped to buttons. I found out about these gamepads almost a year ago and bought the n52te after a little research. After reading a thread in a forum that discussed the G13, it sounded like it had all the features I felt were missing from the n52te, so I bought it.<br /><br />The packaging it arrived in was secure, so nobody should have to worry about damage during transit. As I unboxed it the reality of how monstrous this thing is really hit home. It was huge, and I was unsure whether it would fit on my slide-out tray with the keyboard & mouse. I was able to squeeze it in after pushing the keyboard back a bit (keyboard is a Saitek Gamer's keyboard, mouse is a Razer Death Adder.) As usual I didn't bother installing the software from the box, and went to the website instead. Finding a driver was a snap, and I downloaded and installed the latest drivers.<br /><br />There are, oddly enough, two separate programs that run in the tray for the G13. One is the LCD screen management app, and the other is the gameboard programming app. I'm not quite sure why these couldn't be integrated with one another. I'll get into the programming app later in the review.<br /><br />Hand placement felt good. The buttons are nice and large, and their surface is concave, allowing the user to feel where their fingers are at without any danger of them sliding off and losing track of which keys they're on. It sounds silly, but after you have a gameboard with flat buttons you'll really appreciate this. The gameboard keys are also laid out on a surface that curves in towards the center, allowing for more comfortable operation as opposed to a flat surface which forces the user to rotate their fingers in ways they really aren't meant to. The only drawback is there is no way to adjust for larger or smaller hands. One size fits all. The n52te was somewhat adjustable.<br /><br />Keys? Wow are there a lot of them! There's so many that unfortunately my fingers can't stretch far enough to hit them all comfortably. However, I don't think of this as a problem. I would MUCH rather have too many keys than too little. I still use the fringe keys infrequently for character abilities that don't need to be accessed very often. Also, the only keys that are really able to be accessed rapidly without having to curl your fingers up are the top two rows. I occasionally press one of the third row buttons, but it's rare. Maybe I just need to adapt more? Only time will tell I suppose.<br /><br />The analog thumbstick is both a blessing and a curse, and really the only thing I have a problem with. I say it's a blessing because a digital thumbstick (like the one on the n52te) is just horrible. I found myself stuck in limbo frequently with the n52te because I was moving the thumbstick from the North to West position, and the thumbstick would stop sending a signal as I moved it between these states. Also, one of the big things I wished for on the n52te was that the thumbstick act as a button if you push down on it. This was all solved with the G13. The thumbstick is analog, allowing for a full range of motion without that \\"clicky\\" feel as you maneuver it. The thumbstick also acts as an additional button when you depress it. The curse is that the thumbstick itself feels awful. The hat on it is way too small, leaving the user to feel like they're trying to use the eraser end of a pencil to move around. It's a real shame too, because everything else about this gameboard is absolutely terrific.<br /><br />The gameboard lighting is also really cool. There are 3 modes that can be cycled through, so all of the keys you see are effectively TRIPLED. Yeah. This thing is *insane* with the coverage it has when it comes to duplicating everything you can assign to a standard keyboard. Anyway, each mode has its own color of light, and the color can be selected using the gameboard editor. There are a lot of different colors to choose from also, so you're not pigeon-holed into only a handful of choices.<br /><br />The LCD screen is a very nice touch. It can report all sorts of in-game statistics, and can be set to receive RSS feeds from the news, display computer info such as CPU load, the time & date, and all sorts of other statistics. The LCD screen can apparently be programmed by anyone, so you can write your own custom G13 LCD screen plug-in to display literally anything you want. Unfortunately as of this writing Warhammer Online only displays its icon, and I've seen it sometimes display a message stating that I'm not queued for any scenarios (you have to play Warhammer Online to know what I'm talking about here.)<br /><br />The gameboard programming software is simple and easy to use. Making macros is a breeze. One of the other big gripes I had about the n52te was with programming simple keyboard combinations. You want to assign a button on the gameboard to Ctrl+1? Sorry, the n52te software will only recognize the first button you press, so you only get Ctrl. To assign combinations you have to create a macro. Ugh! Not with the G13. It easily recognizes Ctrl/Alt/Shift modifiers, and even goes so far as to recognize *which* one you've pressed, whether it's right or left. Making a macro is nice and easy too, and you can copy & paste them between different modes to set up the device fairly rapidly.<br /><br />So to sum up...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- LCD screen is fantastic and provides a great means to display information<br />- TONS of keys that are tripled via mode switching<br />- Concave keys and surface which creates a comfortable surface for the hand<br />- Analog thumbstick as opposed to digital<br />- Many lighting color schemes to choose from<br />- Easy to use programming software<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's HUGE<br />- The analog thumbstick's surface is too small<br />- Not adjustable to accommodate small or large hands<br />- Since there are so many keys, some are simply impractical for frequent use since they're so far apart<br /><br />The pros so overwhelmingly make up for the trivial cons that I cannot emphasize enough how great this gameboard is. It's just one of those things you must try to truly appreciate. I will also give a disclaimer that there is *always* a learning curve when it comes to these devices. If you have never used a gameboard before, you will find yourself lost until your hand can seek out the buttons and operate the thumbstick without having to think about it. Once it becomes natural for you to use it, that's when the lightbulb will come on over your head and you'll wonder how you ever played games without one.a signal as I moved it between these states.

B001N18HOQ|3.0|Ok, I love PEARL JAM but this set is for Die hard fans only!!!!!!! because if you already own \\" TEN \\" then there is no reason to spend $27.00 bucks on this set. I bought this set for 2 reasons, 1. I have always wanted the Unplugged show on dvd since I first show it on MTV years ago and 2. I thought the so called re-mix cd was like oh ya know re-mixed songs! If you play the old version of \\"TEN\\" and then the new re-mastered version and then the \\" re-mixed\\" version there is no real differnce. maybe if you sat in your livingroom with Eddie Vedder and asked him he might be able to tell you.lol. really. I guess the re-mixed version sounds maybe a little tiny bit different but if you didn't know you would simply think it's the same cd. Like I said FOR DIEHARD FANS ONLY.!! The packaging is really nice, but that's about it. So, now i have 3 copies of \\"TEN\\". The dvd is awesome BTW.
0374139563|5.0|Wow, what a breath of fresh air this woman is. Sure, some of the arguments that have been made in this book have been made before, but Ms. Moyo presents them in a startlingly fresh and direct way. Like many brilliant minds, Ms. Moyo can say a lot with a little and the brevity of this book only serves to aid its piercing--yet reasoned--arguments. This book is, quite simply, a frank assessment of where Africa is, how they got there, and a road map for the rise of Africa going forward--all in a little over 200 pages. I for one hope that the world follows her advice sooner rather than later. Africa is a beautiful place with beautiful people and I wish they could be allowed to rise without the constant tinkering of colonial powers, well-intentioned (yet misguided) liberals and celebrities. An unqualified 5/5 stars and I am a huge new-found fan of this woman.
044024367X|1.0|The previous 11 Jack Reacher have all been first rate.  There's no reason author Lee Child has lost his mojo, so let's just pretend this one never happened.    No end of problems with it...    OVERBLOWN:  Easily 100 pages too long.  Lots of padding.  It just kept going and going and going...    LITTLE ACTION:  Reacher punches a guy.  He grabs a gun from a cop.  He wrecks a police car.  He beats up six guys in a bar.  He beats up two guys, one of whom is bigger than he is.  Oh, there's a lot of vague sneaking around at night, but that's all the action in the book.    BELIEVABILITY:  Child is a Brit who usually \\"gets\\" America, or at least offers a unique outsiders take on things.  But this time, all we get is an elitist's cartoon version of middle America.    AUTHENTICITY:  Usually good, but often hit-or-miss with Child.  Sometimes he is totally accurate; sometimes he just makes stuff up.  This book falls disproportionately into the latter category.  He veers quickly from the usual, \\"Jeez, this could actually happen,\\" into, \\"Man, this is ridiculous!\\"    POLITICS:  Just a bad idea.  Politics don't belong with Jack Reacher; Reacher is a funhouse mirror upon which we project ourselves.    PLOT:  I thought the extra length of the book was to tie up all the loose ends.  Wrong.  Most of what we get for plot resolution is just Reacher stating what he guesses things to be.  Multiple plots, which are never tied together or explained.    CLIMAX:  Without giving away a spoiler, if you make it though to the bitter end you're going to be shocked -- by the stupdity or irresponisibility or lack of believability or authenticy with which Child chooses to end his novel.    Hopefully, this was just a step off the path, and we'll return to the usual with the next adventure.
0670020745|3.0|I thought the subject matter and her story were very interesting.  However the whole book is a little \\"light\\"-- kind of like a camp counselor telling her story rather than a neuroscientist.  While this makes the book very accessible to a wider audience, I did find the repetitive cheerleadery narrative style a little tedious.  I read this book looking for knowledge on the left and right brains and figured information from someone whose left brain had \\"gone offline\\" and then recovered would be fascinating.  It was, but I wanted a little more.  I am sure, however, if I had come to this book as a guide while helping someone recover from a stroke, I would have appreciated the lighter encouraging tone a lot more.  I commend Dr. Jill for the incredible hard work she must have done to recover and would recommend her book to anyone dealing with stroke recovery.

B001PPGAIA|3.0|To 20the Century Fox, \\"Australia\\" is a bomb as big as the ones the Japanese dropped in Darwin during the Second World War. To Australia, \\"Australia\\" is still the second highest grossing movie in Australian film industry. To the audience, mixed reviews are the norm for this $190 million epic that burns a hole nearly in every part of the world.<br /><br />Australia is not half bad. Seriously. It's Baz Luhrmann, the entertaining director who gave us \\"Strictly Ballroom\\", \\"Romeo+Juliet\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge\\". However, it is because of that that makes \\"Australia\\" failed to please anyone who likes the above films. The thing is, Baz has his own directing style, which worked perfectly with his previous films, but trying to keep his own style while trying to tell a real, serious epic story that involved one of the biggest wars in human history just didn't make it right for him. The product was a mix of style and scenes that actually failed to deliver the required chemistry that the audience was expecting.<br /><br />\\"Australia\\" started off dealing with the topic of the Stolen Generation, but then apart from having an aboriginal boy (who was excellent) and his family to represent the stolen generation and what impact it is having on them, there was virtually nothing really that could touch the audience's heart. It lacks the raw impact of \\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\" (See my review on this) and \\"The Tracker\\" when dealing with the Stolen Generation. Although one thing I must say was that I was impressed about the blatant dialogue about \\"Breeding out the blacks\\" which I don't think we see a lot in international cinemas.<br /><br />The opening of the film looked very Baz and \\"Moulin Rogue\\" and \\"Romeo+Juliet\\", you certainly know that it is a Baz movie. But does that kind of entertaining and funny shots actually fit right into the serious notion of \\"We are telling the world about Australia's Stolen Generation\\" is something else. This inevitably weakened the opening of the film. To be honest, the first half an hour, which was supposed to be used for capturing audience's attention, was so weak that several times I thought switching the terminal (I saw it on a flight) to another channel. It's only my persistent to finish the movie to give it a fair review that I finish this 3 hour ordeal. After the first hour, the movie seems to get its act together again and then it becomes more interesting. However, how many people could be graceful enough to give a 3 hour sit an hour of credit without judging it immediately?<br /><br />A lot of people were complaining Nicole Kidman as the ice queen and the wooden actress but I must say she is not half bad. The thing is Baz unique direction of trying to make her look too much alike to Satine in \\"Moulin Rouge\\" to distinguish the character's growth into a serious business woman later just really didn't work. Satine gave Nic her first Oscar nomination, but it was such an impressive character that anything trying to play homage or imitate that character will completely destroy it. And that's the main problem with Nic's performance in \\"Australia\\". Hugh Jackman's character lacks depth until after half way through, and David Wenham's villain is just they need a villain for the movie and there he went. It is surprising that a 3 hour movie could be failing so badly in character development and at the end of the day, you don't seem to understand most of them except for the drastic change of Sarah (Nic) from a aristocrat to a ranch station owner. Nullah was great but suffers a similar fate. However I really enjoyed his relationship with his grandfather King George - and this is the most interesting aspect of the movie. There are other characters throughout but surprisingly some of them are quite memorable - Essie Davis and Jack Thompson, they are both brief characters but very memorable. Yuen Wah as the ranch cook just feels very out of place and one thing I can't understand is why Chinese actors always have to be the one to delivercomic moments in western movies? It is because of the forced comic moments that he has to deliver that I found him very irritating throughout.<br /><br />At the end of the day, \\"Australia\\" is not that bad. But Baz should know by now that piecing a montage of his previous successful styles won't work on serious movie with a serious topic (if that's what he wants to deliver). Also, naming a movie after Australia itself will not help to promote Australia either, and may in fact have a backlash of killing potential audience's interests. Lastly, avoid hyping a movie too much cause as we all know, the greater the hype the bigger the fall. \\"Australia\\" was killed by a number of unsuccessful elements embedded in the production itself, but if I want to be honest about it, it is not as bad as the media said. It certainly did not live up to Baz's standards (I mean the one we, the audience set for him) but the bad press is more about the media going in for a kill instead of looking at the movie objectively. I would still recommend it when you have 3 hours to kill (such as on a flight) but don't bring too much expectation to it and you will enjoy it.ies?

0812979656|4.0|I read this book for a college class based in India lit. Out of all the books we read this would have to be my fav. Its a easy read. The books flows nicely from one place to the next. We are told the story of the childrens mother in the eyes of a young girl as she comes back to see her brother. The whole background story was really well written, but the only problem I did have with it was that we are left at the end not really knowing what will happen to her brother at this older age. Otherwise its a great read to get a feel of India of the lifestyles of the people.
0316067601|5.0|I am not an avid reader, however I quickly found myself unable to part from the pages of this book for any length of time. Marcus's story of survival and heroism is unbelievable, a true testimony to the great Americans among us, who willingly sacrifice themselves to protect the very freedom most Americans take for granted. I hope that Marcus will see this review and know that tears filled my eyes as I read the final pages. God Bless Marcus Lattrell, the members of the US military and their families. This book is a must read for all Americans!
0783228457|2.0|Max Renn (James Woods), the head programmer for a cable TV station that specializes in sleaze, thinks he is on to the next big thing when he discovers \\"Videodrome\\", a show containing no plot and non-stop violence. However, Renn soon discovers that \\"Videodrome\\" was created by a group of right-wing extremists who wish to kill \\"the sort of scum who would watch something like that\\" and gains first-hand knowledge of the consequences of watching \\"Videodrome\\", including frightening hallucinations and death.    Given the popularity of movies such as \\"Saw\\" and \\"Hostel\\", the central idea of \\"Videodrome\\", that of someone wanting to kill the sort of people who would watch \\"gore porn\\", is still very relevant, in spite of the fact that over 25 years have passed since its release. Watching this film in the context of our modern reality brings a whole new dimension to this film, above that which writer/director David Cronenberg probably originally intended, and because of that, I did find myself appreciating aspects of this film. However, overall, I was disappointed by \\"Videodrome\\". As the film progresses (and Woods hallucinates more and more), in becomes increasingly incoherent; the supposedly \\"disturbing\\" special effects seem unimpressive compared with what modern audiences would be used to; and although the subject matter was original when this film was made, subsequent movies (such as the Spanish movie \\"Tesis\\") have better dealt with it. I am glad that I watched this movie, but its short-comings make it unlikely that I will ever watch it again.
0805066691|3.0|The strength of \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" is also its weakness: Its commitment to telling an ugly truth about American history so searing as to become numbing after a while.<br /><br />It's impossible to consider fairly this, Dee Brown's 1971 examination of the Indian Wars of the American West, without remembering how much it cut against what was then still the mainstream thinking and literature regarding just what happened. The Indians were often bloodthirsty, it was alleged, and our American forefathers imbued themselves in the pioneer spirit by bringing the red man to heel. Brown took an entirely different course.<br /><br />\\"Americans who have always looked westward when reading about this period should read this book facing eastward,\\" Brown writes in his preface.<br /><br />And that's how he writes it, from the perspective of displaced Navajos, Utes, Sioux, Apaches, and more than a dozen other American Indian tribes who were the victims of Manifest Destiny. As Brown tells it, their story is one of being washed away by the greed and savagery of white Americans.<br /><br />The book is often strongest when that savagery is at its ugliest. At Sand Creek in 1864, a regiment of Colorado volunteers under the command of an American Eichmann, one Col. John Chivington, rode into a peaceful village of treaty-abiding Cheyennes and gunned down more than a hundred men, women, and children. Asked about the children, Chivington replied: \\"Nits make lice!\\"<br /><br />It's a raw tale that sits like lead in the stomach of any decent-minded American. But for Brown, that's all you need to hear. The fact that Chivington was cashiered for his murdering, and Colorado's governor cast from office for his part in the massacre by President Andrew Johnson, is not mentioned here. Instead, Brown says the Chivington slaughter was received with satisfaction by whites in toto, as a way of getting Indians out of Colorado.<br /><br />Brown's storytelling is often one-way like that. His exactitude regarding white atrocities is impressive, but when he notes the Apaches' attacks on Mexicans, he claims imprecise records make blame hard to apportion. When young \\"dog soldiers\\" leave the reservation to steal cattle and attack settlers, then run back home to be covered for by their elders, their actions are excused as an understandable response to being cooped up in a plot of land just a few hundred square miles in size. The fact this might have made whites less respectful of treaty conditions is not explored.<br /><br />Brown isn't entirely dogmatic like this; he understands the history well enough to allow for the occasional humane impulse by a white man, or an Indian who goes too far, like Captain Jack of the Modocs, a normally peaceful chief goaded by his juniors into killing whites around a peace table. He doesn't use the politically correct term \\"Native American\\", though that is probably because the book was written long before it came into vogue.<br /><br />The narrative echoes the terse stylings commonly associated with the voice of the Indian, but it becomes colorless and drab reading after a time. None of the Indians really come alive as characters, or as people. They speak to the white man's greed, and exit stage left. Occasionally we learn that this one had a pendant mustache, and that one wore a plugged hat. But they lack vibrancy. Even Sitting Bull, one ornery cuss in life, is here reduced to a stoic sufferer.<br /><br />Brown's book is real history, powerfully told, and you will not forget, nor should forget, the gist of what you read. But it reads too much like history in service of a cause.<br /><br />\\"There are bad white men and bad Indians,\\" the Cheyenne chief Black Kettle is quoted observing in one early chapter. \\"The bad men on both sides brought about this trouble.\\" It's a point that speaks both to Black Kettle's noble perspicacity and the truth of the matter, but one Brown prefers to ignore, to the detriment of this solid if skewed book.itude regarding white atrocities is impressive, but when he notes the Apaches' attacks on Mexicans, he claims imprecise records make blame hard to apportion.

None of the Indians really come alive as characters, or as people. They speak to the white man's greed, and exit stage left. Occasionally we learn that this one had a pendant mustache, and that one wore a plugged hat. But they lack vibrancy. Even Sitting Bull, one ornery cuss in life, is here reduced to a stoic sufferer.<br /><br />Brown's book is real history, powerfully told, and you will not forget, nor should forget, the gist of what you read. But it reads too much like history in service of a cause.<br /><br />\\"There are bad white men and bad Indians,\\" the Cheyenne chief Black Kettle is quoted observing in one early chapter. \\"The bad men on both sides brought about this trouble.\\" It's a point that speaks both to Black Kettle's noble perspicacity and the truth of the matter, but one Brown prefers to ignore, to the detriment of this solid if skewed book.
B00004TR2G|5.0|This IS the FILM VERSION of John Williams' primordially terrifying, Oscar-winning score to Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece, Jaws!<br /><br />The conducting and performance here are more fast and furious than in the previous MCA re-conducted \\"concert suites\\" \\"Music From the Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" version.  Some cues are actually SHORTER here than they were on that previous MCA version, as they rightly should be; these are the cues exactly as they were presented in the film.<br /><br />For fans of those suites, never fear, film music afficionados; the old MCA version, \\"Music From the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" is also available here on CD from Amazon!<br /><br />I was absolutely delighted to finally hear, for the first time in this \\"Anniversary Collector's Edition\\" release, the soundtrack debut of \\"The Empty Raft\\" (Alex Kintner's Death), because it is the seminal, perhaps most distilled version of the shark's theme in the whole film!  For anyone who hasn't seen the film, the piece starts out with chops of the low strings as we are the underwater POV of the shark.  There is a harp flourish, as we as the shark SEE our next tasty prey, the boy on the raft, the harp strings plucking ever-frantically, the high strings joining, as we close in on the boy's kicking legs until the boy is chomped!  It is the version of the shark theme that Williams no doubt played for Spielberg on a piano that got the director to laugh, because it is so simple...and yet terrifying in its simplicity!<br /><br />This track, right up there with Bernard Hermann's screeching strings for the shower murder scene in Hitchcock's Psycho, along with Spielberg's visuals, struck dread and sheer terror into the hearts, minds and psyches of moviegoers and swimmers everywhere!  It kept everyone out of the water in the summer of 1975.  I'm quite certain that it was primarily this cue that struck a chord in the members of the Academy and deservedly won John Williams his firstOscar for Best Original Score.<br /><br />Several cues on this CD even include MORE notes than were heard in the film, and it's good that Spielberg and Williams elected to fade out the music in the film before the additional notes occurred.  As they explain in the liner notes from the 20th Anniversary laserdisc interview behind-the-scenes documentary filmmaker Laurent Bouzreau used to compile excerpts of those liner notes for this CD, John and Steven did NOT want the music to celebrate a red herring; they only wanted the music to signal the actual arrival of the shark.  In the film, when the shark is gone, the shark music is gone too, fades out with it.<br /><br />There are only two tracks on this CD that keep this \\"Anniversary Collector's Edition\\" from being an otherwise perfect note-for-note presentation of the score:<br /><br />Near the end of \\"The Pier Incident\\", during which two locals, Dennherder and Charlie, have attached Charlie's wife's holiday roast to the pier, and the shark has easily taken the roast, the pier and dragged poor Charlie off a few yards into the drink, at which time the shark realizes that it is not satisfied with its mere appetizer and turns around, the pier swinging with it, to come back and devour the main course, poor Charlie, who is frantically trying to swim for his dear life back to the shore!  When the shark turns around, the pier with it, low strings suddenly give way to high strings, short and loud chops, to indicate that the shark is cruising in straight for poor Charlie, who, overweight and out of shape, can't quite seem to get a foothold on the remaining section of the pier!  On this CD, the high strings continue and the music begins to wind down, deflate, with some high-end clunks of percussion, as Charlie is attempting to climb up on the broken section of the pier and grab his friend's hand, his tennis shoe slipping on the wet wood.  IN THE FILM, the high strings completely give way to low bass strings playing the shark theme in full primordial bore, quickly, frenetically, as if there is no escape from imminent death of being eaten by the shark.  Pure primal terror!  In the film, when Charlie grabs the hand of Dennherder and Dennherder finally pulls Charlie up to safety, we are genuinely, exhaustingly relieved!<br /><br />The other cue that ends a bit too quickly on this CD compared to how the music is presented in the film is at the end of \\"Barrel Off Starboard\\", the first time we see the first barrel emerge in daylight after a rather sleepless night when the shark has terrorized our guys, Brody, Quint and Hooper, on the Orca.  After Quint informs Hooper \\"When he runs, you drop that rope or you'll lose your hands\\", and the shark rears its ugly head to rip the rope from Quint's hands, Brody climbs down off the Orca's engine deck, and Quint asks him, \\"Where you goin'?\\", to which Brody replies, \\"I'm gonna make a phone call\\" and proceeds to the radio inside the Orca's deck to send a May-day message.  Quint disagrees.  Quint grabs a piece of wood resembling a baseball bat, his other hand bleeding from the rope rip, and proceeds to smash the radio to smithereens!  In the film, the thump thump bass viol notes for the shark theme continue all through this interchange, with a bit of solid bass viol, \\"mmmmmmm\\", to indicate that Quint disagrees, and again, \\"mmmmmmm\\", when Quint has grabbed the piece of wood.  On this CD, the thump thump shark theme simply fades out before this interchange between Brody and Quint.<br /><br />These are minor ommissions from an otherwise note-perfect film version of the score, and do not in any way detract from my 5-star rating.  Top marks!<br /><br />Enjoy, preferrably as a late-night symphony...just not on a boat, in the open ocean!der and Charlie, have attached Charlie's wife's holiday roast to the pier, and the shark has easily taken the roast, the pier and dragged poor Charlie off a few yards into the drink, at which time the shark realizes that it is not satisfied with its mere appetizer and turns around, the pier swinging with it, to come back and devour the main course, poor Charlie, who is frantically trying to swim for his dear life back to the shore!

Top marks!<br /><br />It should be noted that, even though the bonus track, \\"Shark Attack\\", was NOT used in the film, its latter strains WERE used in the theatrical trailer FOR the film (available on the 25th and 30th Anniversary DVDs and on the blu-ray).  It's a great little piece that stimulates the visual imagination...begins with a quiet rumble of low strings and bassoons as we picture a slight displacement of the water, then a burst of high woodwinds as the shark's dorsel fin appears, and the strings begin to dredge with fury as the shark seems to be closing in on us as we are frantically swimming toward the shore before we are devoured, trying to get out of the water, which we just barely do, just in time to see the dorsel fin recede beneath the foam of the ocean again...<br /><br />Enjoy, preferrably as a late-night symphony...just don't play this on a boat, at night, in the open ocean!

B000KGGLCU|5.0|The Confessions World Tour CD/DVD is not a concert, its more like an incredible event, it blew me away from the word go, and kept me glued to the screen all the way, not a single dull moment, and I sincerely mean that. Theirs the amazing stage set, incredible lighting, dancers that defy gravity, modern sheek coustumes, incredible sound and of course the unstopable amazingly fit and beautiful MADONNA. I am unfortunate though, I live in South Africa a place Madonna has never visited in her life, so I decided to save up to see her London concert on her birthday. Bought the ticket with half my salary, but never made it, the whole flights and accommodation made it impossible, very depressing to say the least. Anyway the following year the CD/DVD came out and boy was that a consolation price to say the least, I told myself I am going to blast this concert using my projector and pretend I was there, after all the empty seat in the front row was supposed to be mine.     The show begins Madonna makes her grand entrance in a huge disco ball, \\"Future Lovers\\" the perfect song to open with amazing images on screen taken from her photoshoot, \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Jump\\" follows after the first section one could litterally walk satisfied, its that good. The second section is more spiritual she sing one of my most favourite ballads in her career \\"Live to tell\\" the amazing \\"Isaac\\" a visual splendour to say the least, a moment that stands out is her closing song of the second section \\"Like it or not\\" amazing solo performance. The Sorry remix rocks and her two dancers paradoxed against the disturbing visuals do an amazing job. The next section is the the a rocker, songs like \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\" I love New York\\" done with insane intensity. Madonna uses every ounce of her energy on yet another amazing solo performance \\"Let it will be\\", things slow down a bit as she sits with her vocalist \\"Isaac\\" and strums her guitar to the beautiful \\"Paradise Not For Me\\", the next and final section willtake you into orbit, starting off with \\"Music\\" her dancers do an amazing rollerskate routine after which Madonna appears in a white \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" inspired suit to two other female dancers and rocks the stage, her Travolta dance solo is the only part that made me giggle at her attempt, it was good though. Then comes for me the most amazing version of Erotica, I remember thinking how does the song \\"Erotica\\" fit in the scheme of things, boy does it. She reinvents the song beautifully and dances with her troop of dancers, a beautiful routine, this was the track I had to repeat, even though I told my self I would play it through without stopping, \\"Erotica\\" suprised me, I loved everything about it, and her body in that black leotard and white high leather boots, Madonna body is amazing. Then came \\"Lucky Star\\" the first single in Madonnas career, so nice to go back that far. It swiftly fuses into her worldwide #1 Hung up the finale of all finale.    I don't care whether you love or hate her, this show is one of the most amazing, creative events I have ever seen. Madonna never fails to amaze, she trully is the Queen of Pop.
0712676090|5.0|I find the message of this 8 year old book still very unique and useful. The creative and rigorous research design produced powerful and lasting results.  Should be read by all, middle and upper managers.
0143038419|3.0|I liked parts of this memoir and was disappointed by other parts. I liked the author's narrative voice. There are lots of interesting bits of trivia - the bit about prayer beads, for example. In the section on India, I thought there was too much fluff about her Texan friend and his nickname for her \\"Groceries\\". It would have been more effective to have just one anecdote about that. As for Bali, I really enjoyed the unfolding of her relationship with Wayan and Tutti. I thought the road trip section could have been omitted. I have read some other reviews and I think I will try \\"A Thousand Days in Venice\\".
1596680296|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  It has great patterns for beginning and experienced knitters alike. All illustrations and instructions are easy to understand even for someone who has never knitted a sock in her life.  There are instructions for knitting with 4 & 5 DPNs, very short, 2, and long circular needles. There are instructions on best ways to cast on.  There are great illustrations and instructions for many types of stitches when making socks and for knitting all difficult parts of the sock. I've read through the book and feel I can even attempt to start making socks with Ann Budd's help. I'm looking forward to trying.

B00005JPY2|5.0|This is one of those rare films that comes along in a time when most fantasy films are just demo reels for stuntmen and effects men.  This film is thoughtful, dark, extremely cynical, and totally thought provoking.  It's one of those films that may have you disagreeing with its outcome or it's characters' motives, but you will be interested in them nonetheless.  This is like a comic book movie done through the lense of the brilliant auteur filmmakers of the late 60's and throughout the 70's.  I a high mark for filmmaking.  A high mark for adapting a previously published work.  A high mark of impactful visuals.  A high mark for actors, mostly unknown, making the unbelievable and fantastic real and relatable.  A high mark for art.  A high mark for writing.  It's that good, I swear.  And you don't have to be a Watchmen fan-boy to like it.  You just have to be an adult.  An intelligent, and always thinking pre-teen to teen.  Someone who loves what films can do for our mind and our eyes.  Someone who misses the days when films were made for more than the simple vegatation.  A time when every film wasn't polled and geared and marketed for 13 year olds.  Us adults do like some fantasy in our life, whether it be dark or not.<br /><br />***No plot synopsis here.  My bad folks***<br /><br />Lets start with the adaption.  It's been a while since I've seen something adapted so seamlessly to the screen.  I first picked up the Watchmen in graphic novel form back in the early 90's, I was about 12 years old.  I'd always heard that this film project was brewing for years.  I'd also heard that it was unfilmmable material.  Alan Moore himself, I believe, said it was unfilmmable.  I never understood this.  I read the thing at 12 and was imagining it as a film.  Hell, if you look at the panels and the way the book is structured, it's already very film-like.  Is it marketable, and does it hold mass appeal for the price tag it would cost, may have been the real question.  For about the first two hours the film is a direct adaption of the book.  Hell, even some of the visuals, and intercutting is taken from the novel.  The only thing I noticed omitted early on was the whole comic-within-the comic The Black Freighter.  That was one thing I guessed would be removed.  Where would it go, and how would it work in the context of a film narrative?  Well, guess what?  It was only omitted for the initial theatrical release.  Zach Snyder felt the Watchmen is incomplete without The Black Freighter, and he will be editing animated footage of the short story back into the film for a director's cut.  Can't wait to see how it plays out in the film form.  The third act is where things really start to change in adaption.<br />****SPOILERS****<br />Sorry, can't avoid them when talking about this and how much it helps the film version.  We lose the subplot involving the prison psychiatrist.  This I don't mind.  With the story itself, and the Black Freighter, I felt the novel was hammering its point home a little too hard with the inclusion of what the psychiatrist was going through when examing the imprisoned Rorshach.  Good omission.  Finally, the big change in plot has the same outcome but takes a short cut to get there.  In the novel the 'villain' cooks up a scheme involving a fake alien invasion that leads to New York's destruction.  The whole world unites to fight a common evil, forgets about their differences.  In the film the plot is less convoluted.  The 'Villain' no longer cooks up an alien invasion, but instead uses an already available resource in the body of Dr. Manhattan to derail nuclear destruction.  It makes the story tighter and further implicates one of the main characters into the action, makes him very important to the plot's outcome, and makes him less of a philosphical figure.  Sure, he's still expousing the meaning of life, but now he plays a part in it's course.  I never thought the idea of artists, scientists, and filmmakers being tricked intocreating a genetic creature from scratch was that important.  It's interesting and wild, but way too convoluted in a story that's already fairly convoluted.  The film's solution to this problem is clever and simple.<br />***SPOILERS END***<br />The acting is all on spot on.  The relationship between the second Nite Owl and Silk Spectre II is done much better in the film.  It comes off more natural and believable here.  It's done with more visuals and less bloated exchanges.  Jackie Earle Haley(best known for his part in the original Bad News Bears, and his Oscar nominated performance in Little Children) lives and breaths Rorshach, arguably the most popular right wing vigilante this side of Rush Limbaugh.  He brings an already lively character to true life.  His performance is complex, playing a man who may be a lone nut, but never compromises his beliefs and suffers no one who doesn't fit into his own moral code.  Special attention must also be given to Billy Crudup and the special effects technicians behind Dr. Manhattan.  Crupdup's voice gives hints of a longing, a lost humanity trying to resurface.  Plus, the animation is subtle and effective on this character, to the degree of Gollum.  Sure, it's not as broadly animated, but it would be wrong for the character if he was.  Carla Gugino also stands out as Silk Spectre I.  Her performance and character is very complicated and not easily understood, especially by those who like to morally grandstand and brow beat others.  She brings a longing and tragedy to her small part.  Plus, is it just me, or does anyone else have the hugest crush on this actress?  She has that rare characteristic of combing cute and comfortable with totally hot and sexy.  Sorry, can't help, but after Sin City she gives me much joy-joy feelings.<br /><br />Like I mentioned before, some of the visuals are directly taken from the comic, and all are fairly breathtaking.  It reminds me of Blade Runner.  The visuals are striking but don't overpower the narrative, and they don't feel like effects for effects sake.  Though, I do tire of the slow to fast ramping of speed in action sequences.  I think this effect stopped awing me right after The Matrix came out.  Zach Snyder has outdone himself with this one.  He has finally made a film that he will be expected to top in every future project.  I heard of him, directing music videos and commercials, as a contender for the remake of Dawn of the Dead.  I didn't feel that film should be remade, it's a horror classic, and his resume just made me guess for the worst.  Low and behold, the film worked.  Sure, it was more a straigh action piece, but the characters, visuals and acting was all top notch.  It was a fun, fast paced piece of fluff of the highest caliber.  Then came 300.  Wasn't as enthralled with this one as much as everyone else was.  I found it striking and mostly entertaing.  I didn't really care about any human body in that film.  They all just seemed like cyphers.  They fought and killed and died, and I didn't really care outside the visuals.  I found it to be an example of something that jumped off the page but sunk on the screen.  He has 100% redeemed himself with Watchmen.  It's fast paced, despite its almost three hour running time, spritely, and visually beautiful and horrifying all in one stroke.<br /><br />This flick is almost fan-boy proof.  Sure, there will always be that small purist contigent that take Alan Moore's word as gospel, and they will openly loathe the film whether they secretly like it or not.  Moore himself should be open to this film and take a load off.  Hollywood did right by him for once.  Though, after League of Extraodinary Gentlemen, I understand where the dude is coming from.<br /><br />PEOPLE WHO SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM:<br /><br />1. If graphic violence bothers you, even though it's brief and not often, just stay away.  Nobody wants to hear your empty tiatribes about how violent films are and how they are destroyingthe fabric of America, a country itself which is considered one of the most violent in the West.<br />2.  Purist, uncompromising fan-boys.  Save it.  Nobody is interested in whether you're a bigger fan of Watchmen, or a more devoted deciple.  We get it.  You read it.  You loved it.  You paste the faces of your favorite Watchmen character on the bodies of silicon enhanced Playboy Bunnies in your room.  Move on...please.<br />3. Action junkies aka vegatables use films as something to pass the time between the next video game.  This film has action, and excitement but it's besides the point and not the reason for its existance.  I hear the Rock just released a remake of Escape to Wich Mountain.  Check that out instead.  Instantly satisfying.  Hyperactive.  Speical effects and star personality driven.  Instantly forgettable and undemanding.<br />4.Folks who can't remove their politics from their movie going experiences.  People who actually believe Hollywood is involved in some mass conspiracy to warp your children's morals, and to turn them into extreme lefty socialists.  Please, stop.  Just stay home.  It's just a fantasy parable about super heroes, and what their existance would do to our past history in the 20th century.  Nixon sucked.  It's a fact.  There will never be a 6 dollar bill with Reagans face on it, and he certainly won't get a spot on Mount Rushmore.  You guys had your shot.  The extreme religous disease that invaded your party has corrupted your principles and core ideals.  Deal with them, and let the rest of us risk our brains with this piece of thoughtful pulp fiction.<br />5. Finally, all those who fear change, or the fact taht writers like to transcend and disect material as Americana as apple pie.  This is not a kid's movie.  It's rated accordingly.  The definitions of right and wrong, and what makes a hero is turned on its head and hypothesised in situations that most super hero fims don't dare venture into.  It's not Superman.  It's not Spider-Man.  It's not just visceral pop entertainment, even though it's that too, it's got ideas.  It will make you think.  It might make you angry.  It might make you feel justified.  The bottom line is it will make you think and maybe even start some involved discussions.  Ones that moves beyond how 'Kewl' the special effects were.  Then, you'll stop and say, \\"Hey, are we really talking in this much depth about a flick involving rubber clad super heroes, and a glowing blue guy who chills on Mars?\\"  Yup, you are.<br /><br />See it.  Don't see it.  Like Blade Runner and other films of this type, it won't matter how much dough the flick makes or how much everyone and their grandma likes it.  This will live on while films like Spider-Man 3 and Iron-Man just end up being time filler on TNT.<br /><br />2-DISC DIRECTOR'S CUT DVD UPDATE 7/12/2009<br />Well, any internet Watchment fanboy could tell you, but this isn't quite the director's cut released next week.  It's got an additional 24 minutes of footage that adds some more texture and reinstates Hollis' death scene and Night Owl's bloody revenge.  Plus, some of the action scenes have been beefed up, especially the jail break scene.  It's basically the entire novel minus the Black Freighter.  Fret not, this version will be released again on Dec. 9th, 2009 with the Black Freighter animated short  woven into the film just like the novel in a five disc Ultimate Edition set.  The Ultimate set will have a new commentary by the director on the first two discs, the entire partially animated graphic novel on the next two discs, and on the fifth will be all new unreleased behind the scenes stuff including the mockumentary Under the Hood, which was previously released on the Black Freighter dvd.  Hell, this month's release comes with a ten dollar rebate towards the Ultimate Edition.  I'm most certainly going to be going in for the 'ol double dip.<br /><br />This director's cut has a second disc with some special features on it, even a couple more on the Blu-Ray, three to be exact, four if you include the useless digital copy.  We get a My Chemical Romance music video that is in step with the film's tone but will most likely only be viewed once.  We also get a half hour doc concerning the novel's creation and genesis that goes all the way up to the film's creation.  Oddly, the film's screenwriters aren't interviewed regarding the novel's adaption.  There are extenssive interviews with the filmmakers, DC artists and publishers, and Dave Gibbons, of course.  Then you get several short but informative webisodes regarding the costumes, vehicles, design, story, and costumes.  The webisodes go more into the hows and less into the why's, but they are quite satisfying.  And that's it.<br /><br />A bunch of folks are going to piss and moan regarding the double dip, a double dip that has been old news since the film's original theatrical release, but not me.  I'm happy to have a version with the Black Freighter and one without.  I'm also happy to have the Black Freighter seperately.  Sure, I already bought the moving comic, but I think I know some folks who can take it off my hands happily.  I can't wait to hear director Zack Snyder's commentary in December.  The only thing I can live without is the theatrical cut, and I don't have to have it this way.  Listen, gripey fanboys, don't buy this version or do.  Just rent it if you don't want to double dip.  Buy it and ask for the Ultimate Edition for a Christmas present.  See?  I just solved all the major problems in your life.  Thank me.<br /><br />PS:  Yes, that's a man's penis!  Grow up.  No, these aren't your mom and pops' super heroes.  No, there still isn't a giant alien squid thingy.  THERE WILL NEVER BE A GIANT ALIEN SQUID!  Deal.  The movie is better for this change from the novel.  Trust me.  And finally, the soundtrack and source music placement is PERFECTION!  Especially, \\"Unforgettable\\" for the opening scene and \\"99 Red Balloons\\" for Night Owl's and Silk Spectre's reunion date.  Stop being so narrow and simple.  Think about the whys and the placemnt and it will all become clear and way more fun.  Try thinking in a more gutteral manner, how the songs feel and not their literal meaning.  Again, trust me, they work.  If not, and you still don't see it or agree, well, um, then well........ then keep being boring????ne of the most violent in the West.  2.

Finally, all those who fear change, or the fact taht writers like to transcend and disect material as Americana as apple pie.  This is not a kid's movie.  It's rated accordingly.  The definitions of right and wrong, and what makes a hero is turned on its head and hypothesised in situations that most super hero fims don't dare venture into.  It's not Superman.  It's not Spider-Man.  It's not just visceral pop entertainment, even though it's that too, it's got ideas.  It will make you think.  It might make you angry.  It might make you feel justified.  The bottom line is it will make you think and maybe even start some involved discussions.  Ones that moves beyond how 'Kewl' the special effects were.  Then, you'll stop and say, \\"Hey, are we really talking in this much depth about a flick involving rubber clad super heroes, and a glowing blue guy who chills on Mars?\\"  Yup, you are.    See it.  Don't see it.  Like Blade Runner and other films of this type, it won't matter how much dough the flick makes or how much everyone and their grandma likes it.  This will live on while films like Spider-Man 3 and Iron-Man just end up being time filler on TNT.    2-DISC DIRECTOR'S CUT DVD UPDATE 7/12/2009  Well, any internet Watchment fanboy could tell you, but this isn't quite the director's cut released next week.  It's got an additional 24 minutes of footage that adds some more texture and reinstates Hollis' death scene and Night Owl's bloody revenge.  Plus, some of the action scenes have been beefed up, especially the jail break scene.  It's basically the entire novel minus the Black Freighter.  Fret not, this version will be released again on Dec. 9th, 2009 with the Black Freighter animated short  woven into the film just like the novel in a five disc Ultimate Edition set.  The Ultimate set will have a new commentary by the director on the first two discs, the entire partially animated graphic novel on the next two discs, and on the fifth will be all new unreleased behind the scenes stuff including the mockumentary Under the Hood, which was previously released on the Black Freighter dvd.  Hell, this month's release comes with a ten dollar rebate towards the Ultimate Edition.  I'm most certainly going to be going in for the 'ol double dip.    This director's cut has a second disc with some special features on it, even a couple more on the Blu-Ray, three to be exact, four if you include the useless digital copy.  We get a MyChemical Romance music video that is in step with the film's tone but will most likely only be viewed once.  We also get a half hour doc concerning the novel's creation and genesis that goes all the way up to the film's creation.  Oddly, the film's screenwriters aren't interviewed regarding the novel's adaption.  There are extenssive interviews with the filmmakers, DC artists and publishers, and Dave Gibbons, of course.  Then you get several short but informative webisodes regarding the costumes, vehicles, design, story, and costumes.  The webisodes go more into the hows and less into the why's, but they are quite satisfying.  And that's it.    A bunch of folks are going to piss and moan regarding the double dip, a double dip that has been old news since the film's original theatrical release, but not me.  I'm happy to have a version with the Black Freighter and one without.  I'm also happy to have the Black Freighter seperately.  Sure, I already bought the moving comic, but I think I know some folks who can take it off my hands happily.  I can't wait to hear director Zack Snyder's commentary in December.  The only thing I can live without is the theatrical cut, and I don't have to have it this way.  Listen, gripey fanboys, don't buy this version or do.  Just rent it if you don't want to double dip.  Buy it and ask for the Ultimate Edition for a Christmas present.  See?  I just solved all the major problems in your life.  Thank me.    PS:  Yes, that's a man's penis!  Grow up.  No, these aren't your mom and pops' super heroes.  No, there still isn't a giant alien squid thingy.  THERE WILL NEVER BE A GIANT ALIEN SQUID!  Deal.  The movie is better for this change from the novel.  Trust me.  And finally, the soundtrack and source music placement is PERFECTION!  Especially, \\"Unforgettable\\" for the opening scene and \\"99 Red Balloons\\" for Night Owl's and Silk Spectre's reunion date.  Stop being so narrow and simple.  Think about the whys and the placemnt and it will all become clear and way more fun.  Try thinking in a more gutteral manner, how the songs feel and not their literal meaning.  Again, trust me, they work.  If not, and you still don't see it or agree, well, um, then well........ then keep being boring????

B001EOOQEM|5.0|I became a Sabbath fan in 1977.  When Heaven and Hell came out three years later, I bought it immediately.  It blew me away, and still does to this day.  I own a couple of thousand albums, and this is number one on the list.     At the time, both this record and AC/DC's Back in Black, which came out only months apart, were absolutely IGNORED by the Rock 'n' Roll press and the radio.  No one played either one, and you had to pick up a hard rock-specific magazine like Hit Parader to even read about them. But great music will endure, and both have become revered by metal fans over the years.  If you haven't heard this, get it.  It will not disappoint.

Flat but shiny.<br /><br />A nice cast of some people seldom seen outside the UK was refreshing.<br /><br />You can see the comic has been replaced with the efficient holywood-esque. It's still good, has the trade mark plot twists, be thy less twisted, the action, toned down, and the characters, sanitized some what.. perhaps to appeal to a wider market ?<br /><br />I did buy the disc, so I'll watch it again a few times, but it won't see the use that the likes of his prior oeuvres will.
B000GUJZ4G|5.0|One of my favorite lines from one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't know what it is, but there's something about the whole atmosphere in this picture that's impossible not to love IMO. A movie about feeling alive. FBI agent Johnny Utah (K. Reeves) goes undercover to infiltrate a bank-robbing surfing clique (led by Bodhi (P. Swayze)) and finds himself questioning whose side he is on. Fantastic score by Mark Isham as well. Highly recommended. *****

B001PPLIEG|4.0|\\"Quantum of Solace\\" is the 22nd James Bond film, the second starring Daniel Craig, who continues his characterization of James Bond as an emotionally damaged, nearly sociopathic killer in the employ of MI6. The plotline follows through from \\"Casino Royale\\". Bond has kidnapped the infamous \\"Mr. White\\" of the mysterious \\"Quantum\\" organization, only to find that it is more ubiquitous and dangerous than MI6 imagined. Following a lead to Haiti, Bond finds himself in the company of Bolivian beauty Camille Montes (Olga Kurylenko), a former intimate, now enemy, of a Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric). Mr. Greene is president of an environmental organization that purchases or extorts land to exploit for profit or power. Now he is funding a coup in Bolivia in order to secure oil drilling rights for the CIA, whom he intends to double-cross. Bond's stoic exterior conceals an \\"inconsolable rage\\" at the death of his lover Vesper Lynd, making him even more a loose cannon than ever.<br /><br />The film takes its title from an otherwise unrelated short story by Ian Fleming. Just what \\"Quantum\\" is is still obscure, but at least \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is shorter and without the gaping holes in its plot that afflicted \\"Casino Royale\\". There is still an overly long, tedious foot chase near the beginning of the film, but the other action sequences are more compelling -if chaotic- than those in the previous film. What I find interesting is that the characterization of both Bond and the entire intelligence community is a radical departure from the first 20 Bond films. Bond is no longer the good guy. He is morally adrift, a licensed killer absorbed by grief, who cannot always tell his friends from his enemies. He's more of an anti-hero than a hero. Far from being fun or glamorous, sex now equals death. Every woman Bond beds meets a tragic, often gruesome, end at the hands of his enemies.<br /><br />We know very little about \\"Quantum\\", except that it does bad things, so it must be bad. The intelligence community is engulfed in moral chaos. The CIA occupies itself with securing oil reserves without so much as a nod to freedom or justice. Vengeance is the most common motivator. It almost makes Greene, who is motivated purely by profit, seem like a welcome relief. MI6's methodologies and trail of corpses leave much to be desired in the way of restraint and ethics. MI6 lacks any moral compass or even a clear objective. The enemy is nebulous, and it isn't clear what anyone is fighting for or what they hope to achieve. Even an environmental organization is just a front for a utility monopoly. It's like global gang warfare. Bond is both the agent of the chaos and its victim. In this world, when people don't have a clear enemy, they make one up, but it is never actually clear, and they are left with nothing to measure their own behavior by.<br /><br />The DVD (MGM 2009 single disc): The bonus features on the single disc edition are a music video (4 1/2 min) for \\"Another Way to Die\\" by Alicia Keys and Jack White, a theatrical teaser (2 min), and a theatrical trailer (2 min).

0553582461|4.0|Well, first I have to say that this was one of the top 10 series I have read in years. All the characters were real, in depth, people you know well and feel for. My biggest complaint is never really getting to know just who, and what the Fool really was. Poor Fitz was always just one step behind at life. I still can't understand why he went back to a woman who knew nothing about the real person Fitz, and had been married to another man for years and years with scads of children. Ah Well. The story was grippingly interesting right up to the end.(wich was 23rds of the way through the book, then it plods on with tying up loose ends that never really satisfied me. I can't imagine how afer all they had been through, the Fool and Fitz could just pull the plug and split. Huh! Secretly I hope there may be another trilogy to follow that picks up where their relationship left off. And, I was expecting Fitz to bond with one of the Dragons, that would have been a kick. ummm another idea for a sequal? Still, this is Hobb at her best, get it you will enjoy.

0375703764|5.0|My kids and I can't wait to share books we love with one another.  I count this one of the advantages of having kids!  This book was passed on to me by my son and I absolutely loved it.  I couldn't put it down and I didn't want it to end.  He and I were frequently on the phone with each other discussing the book. It isn't an easy read and  while I do enjoy easy reads too, for me there's nothing as satisfying as a book that makes me think, totally engulfs me in its world, and yes, forces me to look up words and terms and learn about a topic or topics I'm not familiar with--in this case, architecture.  I was enthralled from start to finish.  There are many reviews here that go into the details of the actual story so I don't feel it's necessary for me to do that.  It's enough to say what I've said and to hope like-minded people will be intrigued enough to pick it up.

B001TODCII|4.0|Liam Neeson plays the lean hard guy surprisingly well in this efficient if brutal thriller.  He is divorced and has given up his career as a government agent of some description, to be near his 17 year old daughter, who lives with his ex-wife and her new rich husband.  When she is kidnapped on a trip to Paris, all his expertise kicks in to get her back.  And really, that is about it - in an era of sophisticated thrillers with labyrinthine plots, the narrative here seems very simple and told in straightforward linear fashion, with few if any surprises.  And yet, it works - because it is lean and fast - the action is brutal and frenetic in close up Bourne style, and once events kick off it really does not let up until the unsurprising conclusion.  Neeson is lithe and believable as a trained killing machine, giving the film a huge boost of credibility.  There is it has to be said a mean streak in Neeson's character at odds with the family man, as he mercilessly kills off any and everything that gets in his way.  In fact, it becomes almost unpleasant that the film is purporting an American has a right to do whatever he likes in Europe to protect `his own', including torture, on the spot assassinations, and untold collateral damage.  However, watched as a straight action flick, this is entertaining enough, as long as you have a strong stomach for the unpleasant underbelly of Paris dying as faces are smashed into hard objects, bullets shatter limbs, and others die in... well, let's say shocking ways.  It's like an urban Rambo invented for a new generation!

1416914307|5.0|this book is phenomenal.    cclare is one of the most inventive authors with her plot twists and ever evolving characters.  Though this book is somewhat more predictable than the last two but it ties everything up as it should be.    Her ending was perfect.  She made it complete without making it too...twilight-y.  By the way, much better series than the Twilight series, my only disappointment is that this book is not more popular.    You would have to have read the other two books before this one to have a clue what was going on but believe me, they are worth the read.  Again, great read and very creative story.    Six stars.  I only wish we had more scenes with Clary and Jace!  Team Jace.  =]]    I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read fiction.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|The Robert P. Parker novel of the same name is a story of late 19th Century friendship. If you've read Kipling or any of several 19th Century novelists, you'll recognize the kind of relationship. It is far more intimate on one level than anything most men would feel comfortable with today and, at the same time, more distant and respectful of boundaries.<br /><br />  Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch have been lawmen roving the west for a dozen years. If a town needs a sheriff or town marshall, they're for hire. Cole, in particular, is quick to resolve things with violence. Neither man is hesitant to be judge., jury and executioner when they think what they believe is the law has been violated.<br /><br />  They come to the town of Appaloosa where Town Marshall Jack Bell has recently gone missing. The audience knows he has been murdered by local evil doer Randall Bragg. Aside from the obviousness of his evil, not much is ever know about Bragg except that he has 20 or more men working for him who apparently are willing to kill on command. Or or the fun of it.<br /><br />  Obviously Cole and Everett, the newly minted Town Marshall and Deputy, will have to tke control of this situation - and through a mixture of very tough diplomacy and some shooting they do. One of Bragg's men offers to become a witness and Bragg is seized.<br /><br />  Perking along in the background is the mysterious Mrs. Allison French who gets off alone from the train one day, pronounces herself a widow and immediately makes a move on Cole. Everett is disconcerted by this and even more so when Allison (Allie) makes a move on him.<br /><br />  The tension between Cole, Everett and Allie doesn't come across as effectively in the movie as in the novel, but it is there.<br /><br />  While Bragg awaits trial, two gunfighters come to town. Cole says they are perhaps as good as he is.<br /><br />  At this point, anything else I say would be a spoiler.<br /><br />  Suffice it to say, that the rest of the movie is a well done 19th Century \\"buddy\\" film, not at all like \\"Butch Cassidy\\", but more like the 1930s \\"Beau Geste\\" and others.<br /><br />  Ed Harris, Viggo Mortenson and Jeremy Irons turn in fine performances. Renee Zellwegger is never quit believable. The story is slow, as is befitting, the setting. The relatively few action scenes are well done.<br /><br />  Above all, this is a film about friendship - and it is well done. Those expecting endless gunplay and violence will be disappointed.<br /><br />Jerrytch Cassidy\\", but more like the 1930s \\"Beau Geste\\" and others.

B001M5UDGS|3.0|I thought this was just so-so - I'm being generous in giving it 3 stars.  I didn't think it was terribly funny - I only smiled a couple of times, no laughs.  The musical numbers seemed like retreads of stuff I've heard before without any special wit added.  The plot, as such, didn't make any sense, although I suppose plot is never a strong feature of musicals.  I guess I just don't get Whedon's sense of humor (or much of anything else he has ever done).

B00009Y3L4|4.0|I have heard of this film for ages but never got around to watching it. I'm glad I did though, if for no other reason that the music, which I enjoyed immensely. While capturing the decadence of Weimar Germany the director also, perhaps unwittingly, captured the backlash against such decadence of ordinary Germans when a Hitler Youth member begins to sing a patriotic song, \\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me,\\" which brings everyone to their feet singing. People were tired of negativity and moral decay and wanted their country to be strong again. The Nazis took advantage of these feelings to rouse the population behind them, a population which never imagined what the ultimate price would be.<br /><br />But aside from the Big Picture, this was a great performance by everyone involved.
B000002LQR|4.0|Really delivering a smash hit for the band this album captured that California funk rock persona so perfectly it's hit singles are probably forever etched into the memory banks of everyone who was 13-25 years old at the time. Playing it again after all these years is a fun but slightly confusing experience. After all the non single like Mellowship Slinky in B Major, Naked in the Rain, My Lovely Man, The Greeting Song....who on earth was listening to this stuff. Well nobody I know that's for sure. Silly, juvenile, drug addled and overly self conscious (look ma, no brains!).Who was listening to the singles like Suck My Kiss, Under the Bridge, Give It Away etc? Well darn near everybody!! Some of these songs have become radio staples and have entered into popular culture in a multi generational manner.<br /><br />Ultimately this album was so successful it's hard to review objectively and besides just how many uninitiated people are out there who haven't already heard it? However my two cents worth can be somewhat summed up by a quote from my girlfriend of the time who after hearing Give It Away said `Wow, it sounds like RHCP have finally written an almost normal song.' To expand, what the band had achieved here was to bridge the gap between their more nonsensical slacker/drug loser persona and the mainstream culture that demanded musical signatures that could be used as something to hold onto.<br /><br />The band achieved this with whimsical lyrics married to a rollicking rhythm section that after a few earlier albums had really hit it's communicative stride. This new found synergy and discipline allowed rockers such as Suck My Kiss to really cut through with identifiable riffs and melodies. It also allowed the more alternative/weird chorus section of Breaking the Girl to be centred in a coherent setting and therefore be even more striking. Not to mention the beautiful Under the Bridge which many probably consider to be the bands best 4:24 even after all these years.<br /><br />A band that had the surfies fired up, the teenage girls squealing and even the heavy rocker fans on board. What's not to love? Oh year, all those non single songs....well I guess it all still equates to a score of four stars.the surfies fired up, the teenage girls squealing and even the heavy rocker fans on board.

It was completely worth the money. Lots of programmable keys and perfect for the guy who plays in the dark (lighted keys). I play while laying around in the bed and because of the tilt or arch of the pad it works perfect for keeping stress and fatigue from happening to my hand. Aside from the lighted keys and the arch I can zoom in with my scope (first person shooter) programable key that is in perfect position of my left thumb, the bad guys are dead. Ha! ha!<br /><br />I really recommend this for anybody who wants to play a heck of a lot better game.<br /><br />I Love it.
0451450523|3.0|I bought The Last Unicorn because I had heard people rave about it and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I'll give Peter Beagle this much: it is a quick read and, at times, quite entertaining. That said, I'm not sure that it deserves the \\"landmark achievement of fantasy literature\\" designation that so many of its readers seem to want to give it. Here are my main reasons why:<br /><br />Plot. Granted, it's a short book. I think, though, that this exacerbates, rather than excuses, what I take to be an interest-deadening disjunction between the first and second halves of the book. Whereas the first half features rapid-fire character introductions and location changes, the second half takes place in a single location with a limited number of characters, some of whom are hardly developed. The author essentially hits the brakes on what was a page turner. To be honest, I'm not sure if the ending (though it does make a return to the faster action of the first half) justifies making it through this \\"flat\\" stretch.<br /><br />Style. Beagle, like too many fantasy authors, overuses the device of paradox, which seems to me to be a rather trite shortcut towards intellectual depth. First, this is a children's book, and I can't imagine that many of his paradoxical (read: nonsensical) turns of phrase would make much sense to his target audience. Second, his paradoxical formulations are predictable, generally meaningless, and full of bathos rather than pathos.<br /><br />If you have a couple of days and want to read, for the sake of being well-rounded, a book many others have read and loved, I wouldn't discourage you from picking up The Last Unicorn. But if your reading time is limited and you are looking for thoroughgoing quality in a book, I would keep looking.

I enjoyed Keri Russell and Guy Pearce in this movie, even though it was weird to see Pearce in a role like this.  He was a hoot! Chuckles and out-and-out belly-laughs abound in this silly (but fun) movie
0439023483|5.0|There is so much in this book to make you say \\"Wow\\". Sure, there's a lot here that's been done before... a post-apocalyptic world where the people are oppressed and forced to take part in some winner-takes-all contest to the death is nothing new, but here it is done so well. Katniss is everything you would expect from a girl that's had to take care of herself and her family most of her life.  She's simple, straight to the point, does what needs to be done however she has to, and yes, a little cold. But she's also stunted.  She's so busy being a grown-up that she's never had time to be a teenage girl, and her people skills are certainly lacking.  When she throws herself into the Games in order to save her much younger sister, she's forced to come to terms with her weaknesses.<br /><br />The Games themselves are a horrifying construction.  24 children (yes, children -- they're all 18 or younger) are forced into an arena of unknown makeup (will it be a forest? a desert? a frozen wasteland? will there be water? wildlife? edible plants?) and are left there to kill or be killed until there is one victor. As if that alone isn't enough, the games makers are there to shake things up and encourage battle, and the entire thing is televised, 24 hours a day.  Katniss's fight for survival is not only a physical one, but an emotional one, as she struggles with her feelings for fellow tribute, Peeta.<br /><br />Since there is a second book (and supposedly a third), I'm going to assume that you realize that Katniss makes it through this alive.  However, all is not necessarily well, and the way the book ends makes you wish there was just one more chapter. The abruptness of the ending has upset some people, but I think it's appropriate.  It leaves you wondering and a little bit confused, much like Katniss is herself.  Because remember, despite what she's done and what she's been through, she's still just a 16 year old girl.<br /><br />As a side note, if you're considering this for your young adult reader, there's no sex or bad language here, but there is a *lot* of violence, some of it quite gruesome.<br /><br />Can't wait for book 2.ere's no sex or bad language here, but there is a *lot* of violence, some of it quite gruesome.    Can't wait for book 2.
B000TGCR3S|3.0|From a technical standpoint I think TK sets a very high standard, however the story and directing dips dangerously close to \\"Animu\\" in a few areas; unnecessary scenes that feel spliced in just to explain the story, too much time spent developing characters we don't really care about, and characters who occasionally \\"overact\\".  In short, it feels too formulamatic.  I blame this largely on the director, Michael Arias; for the life of me I'll never understand how he came to head a project like this.      Studio4C has, in my opinion, the most talented collection of animators on the planet at it's disposal.  Koji Morimoto, Masaaki Yuasa, Shinichiro Watanabe, all fantastic artists with unique visions and talents.  This film is definitely worth watching, even owning, if only for the masterful compositing and design.  However, I'm disappointed in the way the movie flows and how the story is told; I expected something more unique from Studio4C.    Though it hasn't been released in the west, try to find Mind Game (or to a lesser extent Genius Party) if you want to see what Studio4C is capable of.  The beauty of the message of Mind Game moved me to tears, and similarly Yuasa's short in Genius Party said more about human life and death in 15 minutes than most movies accomplish in hours.

[[ASIN:B000YAG00A Full Metal Jacket (Deluxe Widescreen Edition)]] This is only available new or used from amazon marketplace sellers, but it is readily available. This version will fill the screen of your widescreen television. It is the theatrical aspect ratio.    Your money, your choice. Yes, Kubrick did approve the full screen version for home video, but that was in the days of standard definition television, VHS video, etc. We have better options now. Again, your choice.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|This is an amazing movie and I think it may take some people more than one viewing to truly understand how unique this film is. I think Eli truly let the right one in with Oskar.

Don't wait for the American version, see this one and enjoy the magic.

B00009RDGA|5.0|This is a classic movie for many reasons. This movie will be studied by film students for many decades to come. For the art of filming in Black and White,the total in focus both foreground and background, that helps tell many facets of the story. A 9 year old girl or boy would not be allowed to do their own stunts in this day and age. Tatum O'Neal was there from opening shot to the final shot of her running for the car. Tatum O'Neal is the movie. The Academy gave her an Oscar, and for good reason.
6305736650|5.0|The really don't make 'em like they used to. The acting is top notch (take a special look at Bogart & Claude Rains, very unlike the intricate nuances of a fine Keanu Reeves thespian performance), the direction is superb, the dialog is truly memorable (just notice how many lines from this movie made it to pop culture), and the story is simply unforgettable. This is one of the best movies of all time and if you haven't had the chance to see it, do give it a try.

0385334176|4.0|Sadly, Kurt Vonnegut's peephole closed in 2007, 84 years after it opened in 1922. No more Kurt. Or, to borrow yet another phrase from \\"Deadeye Dick,\\" his 10th novel, he became an \\"innocent undifferentiated wisp of nothingness.\\" Whether that actually happened, only he can say. In any case, these and other famous Vonnegut euphemisms (\\"so it goes,\\" \\"the Big Black,\\" etc.) somehow help take the sting out of our ordinary notions of death without removing any of its angst-ridden implications. Perhaps one of his greatest contributions was helping to make non-existence palatable to the masses. If so, what an ineffable gift. But maybe non-existence is funny? Or, to quote the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzu, who sometimes sounds Vonnegetian, \\"Maybe death will be so great we'll regret having ever lived?\\"<br /><br />Rudolph, or Rudy, Walz, also known as \\"Deadeye Dick,\\" the novel's narrator, regrets living. He regrets it so much he forswears physical pleasure as a \\"neuter.\\" After accidentally killing a pregnant woman by firing a rifle from the cupola of his house, his guilt overwhelms him. Particularly when his eccentric father, a once friend of Hitler, takes all of the blame. The two become immediate outcasts in the small town of Midland City, Ohio, succumb to a fair amount of police brutality, and then lose everything in litigation. Along the way Rudy writes a play, \\"Katmandu,\\" so appallingly bad that he's barred from the theater. In response to his father's insistence that the family has not one nanoparticle of artistic talent, Rudy abandons his dream of the writing life and becomes a pharmacist. His overachieving brother becomes the head of NBC and marches through a litany of wives, the first of which he marries because he accidentally throws her through a windshield. Eventually he falls from grace and dignity. Meanwhile, the most beautiful girl in town, Celia Hoover, destroys her sanity with pharmaceuticals, which leads Rudy to muse that \\"the late twentieth century will go down in history, I'm sure, as an era of pharmaceutical buffoonery.\\" Not only that, his mother dies from overexposure to a radioactive fireplace, and the population of Midland City gets decimated by a neutron bomb, though this doesn't affect the buildings. In essence, it's depopulated. Rudy and his now somewhat more sedate brother relocate to the Hotel Oloffson in Haiti, from which Rudy narrates his desultory tale. The book then closed in an open ended manner. No gestalt. Still, it does contain one of his most memorable closers, in spite of it seeming a little tacked on: \\"The Dark Ages - they haven't ended yet.\\"<br /><br />Vonnegut's novels are usually hard to summarize, but \\"Deadeye Dick\\" defies any attempt whatsoever. From ten thousand feet, it looks as though the novel's facile storyline exists merely as a framework for Vonnegut's observations on life and society. Calling it a first person character study does it more justice, as plot seems a mere tertiary concern throughout. Rudy's character, his upbringing, and his life's mistakes stay center stage. This does provide Vonnegut with a good vehicle to muse about confusing aspects of modern existence. The book is absolutely packed with these. As such, those who prefer Vonnegut's commentary over his storytelling will revel in Rudy's ruminations. Perhaps \\"Deadeye Dick\\" was an experiment of sorts, which may help explain why some readers love it while others loathe it. It does not stand amongst his absolute best work, but Vonnegut fans will bask in every page nonetheless.

1596912855|5.0|This book has all the things I love from Jane Austen's books, but with a modern touch. A modern woman living in New York is in love with Mr Darcy (who isn't, right?). She reads Pride and Prejudice and watches the movie religiously. She's single because no man of today seems to measure up. Her great aunt leaves her a trip to an \\"Austenland\\" in England. Everyone there pretends it's the 1800s and there is even a Darcy-esque character. After falling for the wrong guy, and realizing that she can love Austen's Mr. Darcy without sabotaging her real love life, she goes home. On the plane ride home she finds true love, and it leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy. These are my kinds of books. Love stories with good endings. :o)  As an Austen lover myself, I feel Shannon Hale does a terrific job of blending the struggles of today and those of Jane Austen's time. A classic love story. LOVE IT!

0385340990|5.0|This was a wonderful story---I forgot it was fiction.  Poignant and informative.  I highly recommend it for everyone.
0316067601|4.0|As a fellow Sailor having served (and currently serving) in the Middle East I greatly admire Luttrell and his fellow SEALs.  There is no question these guys are true warriors, period.  Luttrell provides tremendous inisight into SEAL training, brotherhood, and operations; which if you choose to cross-reference with other material, you'll find he's spot-on.    This is still one of the best novels on SEALs and what they do, along with how they do it.  Luttrell gives excellent detail and anecdotes.  What kept this from being the best novel on Navy SEALs, hands down, is the political ramblings and 'liberal media bashings' he throws into the story.  I believe he is right in what he says, and most who have seen combat recently should somewhat agree with him, especially concerning the Rules Of Engagement (ROE), as I have found difficulty into determining what exactly it means at times, and the amount of 'gray areas' that lie within.  I empathize with him, the decision he and his Brothers had to face, and in the short time in which they had to make up their mind.  I understand his desire to vent, and get things off his chest; I just hate to see it put a 'black mark' on an otherwise excellent piece of work.  If he had chose to separate the story from his political opinions, ie maybe put them in the epilogue, this would have easily been one of the best SEAL, or military novels on combat operations, no questions asked.      This was an easy book to read, and addicting, to put it bluntly.  There are some with varying political opinions who may be hesitant to pick up this novel up based upon beliefs and ideals.  I encourage anyone to sit down, and give this book a fair shot...worst that could happen is you might learn something about courage, adveristy in the most extreme form, and what our Servicemen and Women deal with on a daily basis.  As I did, you can choose to skim over the parts where he goes on about being a Texan and all that, definitely understandable.    Solid book, well-written...just leave the politics to the guys in DC who sit behind mahogany desks and come up with rules and laws without having seen combat.
B000P0J024|5.0|These two CD's and one DVD showed Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne having fun and making music. What a treat! I'd forgotten how wonderful Roy Orbison's voice was - It soars on the first CD, made just before his death. I missed this on its release, but it's a daily play today.
B001BNFR6W|2.0|I would recommend NOT buying this set from anywhere, because my original purchase had multiple discs issues of not even loading the material at all. When I received my replacement set, many of the same discs still did not work, so it is clearly a production issue that NBC Studios should look into but as far as I know, nothing has been done. In addition these aren't the complete episodes, they are syndicated versions. I rated it 2 stars because the box itself is pretty awesome. Hopefully they'll re-issue this set or at least fix the disc problems.
B0010ZR160|4.0|I think that the movie while strong with good performances by all especially Ed Harris is best when #1 the plot is dealing with the actual mystery of the abduction itself and not as in the last 25 minutes when everyone has to deal with the implications of why one action is moral and another action is immoral and who is better off with whom and #2 when we actually see the tough neighborhood in which these people live even if intellectually we know that such idealized neighborhoods populated by cliques although extremely likeable ones exist only in the imaginations of Hollywood executives.  This is basically the same neighborhood brought to life in The Departed, Mystic River, Sleepers and a host of other films.  I like all those films so I don't have a problem with it but those of you watching this for the first time should know what you're getting into.       Overall-While I liked the movie the plot twist when it comes seems completely arbitrary and the action from that point steams from what decision would Casey Affleck's character the most comfortable.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started doing the 30 Day shred about 2 weeks ago. I'm a 5'9\\" female and started out weighing 144 pounds. Now I am averaging 137-139 pounds.    I first started Level 1 with 8 pound weights because that was all I had but it was way to hard! I actually went all the way down to 3 pound weights.  I did Level 1 for about 8 days and then moved on to Level 2 because I was getting bored with Level 1.  Level 2 is so much more difficult.  I sweat like crazy and I need to modify some of the circuits.    I would absolutely recommend this workout DVD.  I have lost about 5-7 pounds in almost 2 weeks (I'm trying not to weigh myself every day).  Its easy to just do a 20 minute video and I saw results almost immediately!
630471193X|5.0|John Travolta as George Malley in \\"the Phenomenon\\" plays a very likable average Joe who has a burst of genius and insight which gives him unique powers.<br /> Travolta and the other actors are very effective. Robert Duvall as the town doctor and Forest Whitaker as the buddy are extremely affecting. Travolta's infectious smile makes the movie worth watching. He wins you over with his wonderful smile and bubbly personality. He's a nice guy amid nice people living in a nice town. The movie at times seems to be in danger of collapsing from its huge weight of niceness. It's a flick that some will find insufferable because of its chronic cuteness and terminal niceness. Some may find the movie subversive.<br /> There's a core of simplicity that could have drowned it, but somehow you surrender to its good nature. Toward the end of the movie we realize that George could eventually be in danger from the mob (the public) because he has become a unique individual, hence a freak, someone different who may pose dangers to others. He could become threatening.<br /> A movie worth watching. Inspirational, touching, and enlightening.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good remake of the movie.  I enjoyed some of the actors more than the previous version (handsome Penry-Jones), and the different settings.  I think that Adm. Croft was Elizabeth's uncle in the 2005 version of Pride & Prejudice.  It didn't get everything right, but, at least it hit the main points.  The 1995 adaptation was more like the book, however, I thought this one made me feel more for Anne's plight, and explained some of the details left out before, in her case, and, in his.  I especially liked the conversations with him & Harville.  It showed how good of friends they were, and explained the situation between Captain Wentworth & Louisa more from his perspective, and I found that to be refreshing.  The music is beautiful, too.  Yes, I missed the true conversation between Anne & Harville!  That was a mistake to change that, and Anne running all over Bath didn't really make any sense.  Maybe the writers wanted us to feel for her love, and urgency not to lose him again?  Also, did anyone else think that Anne's clothes weren't as pretty as Elizabeth's or Mrs. Clay?  I would've liked to see her a little more dressed up sometimes.  And, as for Mrs. Smith, well, at least, they didn't have her confess that she was lame, then, to see her walking so well.  I love the 1995 movie version more, but, I enjoyed this one for a fresh view of the characters, and some of the little details that I missed out on before.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|Well, this is something people I know agree. This has become the album of the year for 2008.  Amazing how great an album can be with so many few arrangements.  Intense, thru the music you can feel the loneliness, the sadness, the cold felt during the creation of For Emma, Forever Ago.  If I had to choose an only album from last year, I'm afraid this would be the lucky one to survive the choice.  SUPERB.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|I know I'm not alone when I say that I can not begin to imagine the courage, soul, seeming fearlessness(although he does admit to being fearful and acknowledges how potentially close death was), bravery, daring, etc. etc. of a man like Philippe Petit. The relative ease with which he deals with heights, I'm sure, will make many viewers cringe a few times during the film. I have never written a review before, but if you are a fan of the extraordinary, this film is for you. It is an inspiring glimpse into what greatness human beings are capable of when we dream, are blessed with a singular determination and daring and when we take care of ourselves(body and mind). Can you imagine after everything Mr. Petit had to do to set the stage for his dance on the wire that he was physically and mentally at ease enough to accomplish the actual act. No twitches or spasms or mental demons that tortured him into a mistake at a time when a mistake might be lethal. Mr. Petit is not a man as I am a man. He is a Superman! In a crazy world where most are dedicating huge portions of their lives to a suspect preperation for some far-fetched after-life... Philippe Petit has surly found his own answers from among his several opportunities to sit amongst the clouds on his wire.
0803730470|5.0|This book is spectacular! A family favorite that we read over and over. Very witty, even for adults.
0525951113|4.0|I haven't written a review recently but thought that this book warranted some commenting due to its nature. First, if you are not technically oriented, some of this book may be too deep. It gets very technical in places. Myself, I am technically oriented, so, naturally I enjoyed it. I thought the story was well written. I found the characters compelling. I thought the motivation for one character was going in one direction when I discovered the motivation was different than my assumption. Fascinating. Without giving too much away, I was pulling for one of the characters in the book that ultimately didn't make it - I was disappointed because clearly this was an interesting character and would have liked to find out more about the character in the next book. It's a story that grabs you - stayed up past my bedtime numerous times to finish more than a few chapters. I've read the \\"Adolescence of P1\\" which was written in the 70s. This book is similar to that but grown-up and on steroids. Thank you Mr. Suarez for a great story. Looking forward to the sequel.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|I am hardly fond of series that last forever, but the trilogy setup by Scalzi has so far been one of the most enjoyable series I have read in years.  The characters are believable AND enjoyable and this \\"last\\" title does not disappoint.<br /><br />The entire book deals with several of the plots setup in the previous series... plots that were never \\"dropped\\" but you always knew they would be dealt with in the future.<br /><br />While I liked the overall nature of the book, it seems to fail in several ways. It introduces us to a new species as a major plot-line, but them drops them without mentioning them again.  The entire relationship of the two major characters is under developed and the final Earth plot-line seems rushed...<br /><br />With these negative things aside, I really did enjoy the book and would suggest it to anyone who read the first two... and while JS has said it is the final book with these main characters, I am hoping that he will reconsider.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I started watching the Firefly series because I love Buffy and Angel and I figured if Joss Whedon is behind it, it must be good.  I would not call myself a sci-fi fan exactly, although I do enjoy the genre.  After watching the amazing TV series and being baffled as to how the heck it could have been canceled, I watched the movie, Serenity, and it did not at all disappoint.  The characters and dialogue are the heart of this movie, and you really care what happens.  I was satisfied with the River story as that was the burning question after the series.  I don't think you have to be a huge sci-fi fan to love this movie or series.  You just have to love a great story.
B001N18HOQ|4.0|\\"Ten\\" is my favorite PJ album, and is probably my favorite grunge-era album, period. I gave this 4 stars, because I would give the original 5 stars... and the remixes don't outdo the original. I did enjoy the bonus tracks... none of which I'd heard before.    I listened to the entire remix album twice through, and didn't find one song I thought, \\"Finally, they fixed this up!\\" The original was a more raw and underpolished gem. Instead with the remixes, I heard all the nuanced differences like the extra grunts and moans, modified vocals, changes in speed, modified riffs, and what I swear to god sounds like a  screwup in Alive at the end of the first chorus (seriously, what the hell is that?), etc., and it just sounded like a new vision of something that really didn't need fixing to begin with.    It's sort of the difference between owning a classic car that has all original specs or owning a classic car that instead has a modern engine, custom paint, 22\\" wheels, and a kickass stereo added to it... it may be 'updated', but why? *shrug*    I still have my beat to hell 1991 CD with a cracked cover, torn liner, and scratched disc which I'll keep, and I'll give the reissue away.
B00011KHTM|2.0|I bought the adapter to use at home (Weekends Mostly) and within 3 months I started having issues with the adapter, Yesterday the unit went dead. I also own the Mini-DVI to DVI adapter which I have owned for over a year and have had no issues (With DAILY USE).    Since I got the Mini-DVI to VGA adapter I noticed the Mini DVI side to be quite a tight fit, but expected it to last at least 6 months. Truly disappointing.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Just like the customer above me, I have a fairly early model (serial 2211). I don't imagine them having any revisions or anything, because this unit is really solid. Let me start by saying that this device should not be considered a Mic in its own right. Sure, it has two condenser microphones stuck on top to record in stereo, but I wouldn't use these mics in any studio unless I had nothing better. This unit is for those people who want to record in the field, and be able to capture 4 tracks of audio in a handheld device.     First, the build quality. Obviously Zoom took a lot of criticism to heart from their first H2 and H4 models. The H4n sports a \\"rubberized\\" hardshell design that's easy to grip, and seems to stand up well to surface scratches. (Mind you, the rubber texture can attract greasy fingerprints which can get annoying if you're a gadget freak like me). The top of the unit where the mics are is metal. There is some plastic on the unit, but definitely better designed than the previous two recorders from zoom. The buttons are easy to press, and the screen is large, allowing you to see everything you need to very easily.    The poster above me wondered why there was no metal cage protecting the microphones (like the previous H4 had). The answer to this is the switchable pattern on the microphones. Each mic can be twisted and swiveled to change the directionality that the mic pics up. In its native position the mics pic up at a 90 degree angle, giving a pretty good stereo image. But when you twist them, the mics are then a 120 degree angle. This is good for picking up sources that are farther away, or even ambient sounds for a wider stereo image. If there was a metal cage over the mics, you couldn't reach your fingers in to twist them. Overall, I would rather have a switchable pickup pattern, than a protective cage. Just don't drop a $350 recorder.     Second, the packaging. Inside the box, the unit came with a hardshell plastic carrying case, usb cable, foamwindscreen, ac adapter, mic stand adapter, manuals and cubase le software, and a 1gb memory card. This is leaps and bounds above the competition. Most other recorders won't come with any of this. Other companies will even make you buy your own ac adapter and memory card. And Zoom went even further and added a plastic carrying case (for those of you worried about dropping it). They were definitely thinking about the customers on this one.     Third, and most importantly, the sound quality. This is why you buy the unit right? The sound quality has to be good or nothing else matters. Overall I was surprisingly impressed with the sound quality. I am an audio engineering student, going to school for sound reproduction, and sound reinforcement. Needless to say, I know my way around a microphone. I was expecting this unit to sound average, just like a pocket (or handheld) recorder usually sounds. But in fact, the H4n sounds pretty decent. The high end is nice and defined, the microphones built into the unit sound really clear. The one thing I can say about the sound is that it is accurate. I have recorded a few tests using my voice, a guitar, and some other misc. elements. I did notice that the microphones gave off a little bit of condenser hiss when the input gain was turned up. This could probably be solved or lessened if you were to get closer to the object and turn down the recording level. But still, it worries me to have a little bit of noise floor coming from the mics, especially if I were to use the recordings for post production video work.     The other thing I noticed was a lack of bass response. This could have been because I was a foot or two away from the microphones, but the bass on the microphones was a little lacking. My voice sounded a little thin. My guitar sounded fine, but guitars don't really have a lot of low end in the first place. Also watch out for handling noise. If you think that you're going to carry the unit around and do interviews while holding it, forget it. All handheld recorders suffer from this (I've read), but its true for this unit as well. Anytime you hold the H4n and move it around, you can hear low end rumbling and handling noise. Just use a tripod, or the included hand/mic clip adapter and you should be fine. (Also get a better windscreen if you're going to use it outside, the one included doesn't do anything outdoors for wind noise. You should buy a fuzzy or \\"hairy\\" windscreen if you want to use it outside)    Overall I think this recorder is the best on the market right now. Although there are a few units that have better sounding built in microphones (sony), it's only marginally better. Plus the H4 is cheaper (by about $150) and has more build in features/functionality. Like the fact that the H4n can record with two built in mics, and two XLR mics simultaneously (4 tracks at once). This means that you can record with the built in mics, but also use your own microphones if you want to add variety, redundancy, etc. You can also just use the unit for a preamp if you only want to use your own microphones to record in the field. I won't name off all of the features, but some included features weren't even necessary and Zoom was nice enough to add them in anyway (guitar tuner, audio interface, stamina mode, MTR mode, 96k recording, etc).     Needless to say, if you need a recorder for any reason, even if it's just for a school project, or for recreation, don't buy the cheapest recorder you can find. Spend a little extra money and get the H4n, it's seriously worth the extra cash for something that will last you much longer. It's simply the best value for a handheld recorder on the market right now.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|I'll add on to the excellent reviews posted on this DVD.    Possibly like those who appreciate TE's skills, I play finger-pick guitar and have watched TE's concerts live.    There's one distinct benefit of this DVD vs watching live: it provides close-ups from different angles of TE performing, heightening the audio-visual experience not possible even from a front-row seat (which I was lucky to get on my first TE concert).    That said, I'm going with the opinion that leaving in TE's between-song interaction with the audience would be good.  It'll provide an opportunity for folks to have the full \\"TE experience\\" which, to me, is genuine human goodness expressed through guitar.    Get the DVD, nevertheless.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. if you are a sex and the city fan you will be blown away by this movie. if you have never seen sex and the city you will still love it, the begining of the movie summerises everything you missed during the series and you will not be lost. it is amazing.
B001MW0J2O|4.0|I confess....I had never heard of Animal Collective until now. I know, I know, a total crime since I consider myself a music collector of all things musical. So \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\", or MPP for short, is my first AC experience. I can't compare it to their other seven albums. I can only take it as it stands and compare it to other artists.<br /><br />On first listen, it was white noise with some hooks here and there, and it reminded me of \\"Smiley Smile\\"-era Beach Boys meets Talking Heads meets Bjork. On repeated listens, my appreciation deepened as the melodies and hooks began to take shape, much like AC's organic approach to making their music here.<br /><br />\\"MPP\\", in the end, was a good listen. I listened to it over and over until I felt I found what I consider the four best tracks. Namely, \\"My Girls\\", \\"Summertime Clothes\\", \\"Lion In A Coma\\" and \\"Brother Sport\\". The rest of the tracks being just good, with the worst track being \\"Taste\\".<br /><br />AC will not win pop album of the year, but it sure is good alternative music to just lose yourself in. I can see Grateful Dead and Phish tours right now! AC must have a trippy, hippie following of loyal fans who call themselves animal names.<br /><br />As a fresh listener who has not been there all along, I give \\"MPP\\" four stars, not five, since I can think of many other albums I'd give five to. Is this five stars compared to the bands previous works? I don't know. I think it's a good alternative release for 2009, in that genre.<br /><br />Of course, if you're a long time fan you'll just want to skip right over this review, but if you are new to the band like me, I give this a thumbs up, and green light it for your music listening pleasure.
B001NFNFF8|3.0|Tommy Lee Jones is the perfect choice to play James Lee Burke's conflicted Louisiana Cajun cop Dave Robicheaux, a recovering alcoholic striving mightily to suppress his sometimes recurring thirst and his always seething penchant for explosive violence.  Dave is a man of honor who lives by his own code giving fits to his superiors and absolute grief to the hucksters, thieves, murderers and criminals he has no compunction about hunting down and kicking the living daylights of or dispatching to eternity when appropriate.      As to the movie, it is well done by an old master, Travenier, but I probably enjoyed it more than some would, having read all of Burke's Robicheaux books and therefore fully versed on all the backstories of the supporting characters.  Native of New Orleans, John Goodman fits in here perfectly, and the rest of the cast is fine.  The only character missing in this story is Dave's partner Clete, who is even more prone to unexpected violence and trouble-making than Dave.    At any rate, as a fan of the books and the characters and having followed the arcs of their lives I thoroughly enjoyed seeing them fleshed out in film.  For neophytes to the Robichueax saga, the movie would probably be confusing and thin.  I would love to see another one, with Tommy Lee in the lead as Dave Robicheaux.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|What happened here?  Audioslave is my favorite band, and I follow almost all of Chris Cornell's work.  From Euphoria Morning to Carry On, I love it all.  But this, I do not know what this is.  It's as if Timberlake took a crap on a CD-R and Cornell was forced to write lyrics to it.  I made this purchase before the CD came out, assuming I would like it no matter what.  I mean, how much could one musicians work change from 1 CD to the next?  WOW.  It's a cross between techno-pop and garbage.  Unlistenable.  Never before have I returned a CD before even opening it.  I heard previews of a few songs, and my mind was made up.    For those who are Cornell fans (temple of the dog, audioslave, etc) DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CD.  Do not even pirate it, turn the radio off when a song comes on (unlikely that it ever will).  Go back to itunes and turn on I Am The Highway.  :-(
0375836675|4.0|This book is gripping, funny, sentimental, and raw.  It's a story of a young cab driver's life containing a ticked off mom, a stinky dog, three really good friends, and a series of mysterious challenges.<br /><br />I made the mistake of picking this book up in the middle of several projects.  Once I started it, I didn't want to set it down for anything.

B001PPLIEQ|1.0|`Quantum of Solace' is undoubtedly the very worst James Bond film I had ever watched, and was ever produced.     First, for those that haven't seen `Casino Royale', don't even bother watching `Quantum of Solace'. There are characters in `Quantum of Solace', and references to characters left over from `Casino Royale' that will leave you lost in the extremely confusing plot and story line of  `Quantum of Solace'.    As far as I can remember, through all the James Bond films, this I believe is a first... continuing some of the plot and story line from the previous film produced.    Then you have what I would say is extremely poor directing, cinematography, and editing, especially in the action scenes. Everybody loves intense action scenes, but through this one, don't even blink, as you'll miss `something', that will have you scrolling back to see what you missed. In fact, one might be better off viewing the action scenes in a slow motion mode on your DVD player, if it has one.    Many of the action scenes were filmed at very extreme close up levels, making you wonder what's really going on in the scene. And a very bad `cut and paste', or editing, of those actions that cuts back and forth from one angle to another, still leaving you wonder what is really happening with the scene. Often seeing maybe one second of a view before changing to another.    The sound editing was also lacking in what I would consider an ideal mixing of the sound. Running through my Denon receiver in the DTS mode, I found balancing the channels through my surround sound speakers, I couldn't clearly hear conversations. Turning up the volume on my center channel so that conversations could be clearly heard, and that overpowered the entire surround sound to the rest of the speakers to where I had just about everything coming out of my center channel.    What is stated as, `The Perfect Bond Film' (-Premiere) on the box, clearly leaves a lot to be desired in a James Bond film. There wasn't even that little bit of humor between James Bond and `Q' in this film. There was no appearance of any `Q' in this film presenting James Bond with any new `gadgets'.      And the opening music and video will certainly `not' be one of those typical memorable famous openings that made so many previous James Bond films exciting before they even started. I was so disappointed in this film that I didn't even bother watching the special features on the second bonus disk that I paid extra for.    It would appear that the current producers of James Bond films were possibly in some sort of rush to produce another James Bond film with Daniel Craig as James Bond, possibly to gain some sort of acceptance of Daniel Craig as James Bond, accepting the first script for a movie that came along.    In my eyes, being a long time James Bond fan, Daniel Craig, although a good actor in other roles, just doesn't make for the right `James Bond'. And will go down as those temporary, short-lived James Bond characters from the past, such as, George Lazenby and Timothy Dalton.     As much as Sean Connery will always be `the' James Bond, certainly Roger Moore has a high rating in my book as well, being an all around great actor that has performed very well various roles and movies. When Pierce Brosnan gained a big audience and acceptance in the James Bond role, after 4 movies he was no more. From what I hear, partly due to the desire to remake the original Casino Royale, after years of negotiations for the rights for the remake, and when James Bond was first beginning his career as the famous `007', so a much younger actor was needed for that role.    Even though it was impossible to include the original `M', (Bernard Lee) in Casino Royale due to his passing in 1981 while preparing for `For Your Eyes Only'. Out of respect, no new actor was hired to take over the role of M. In the film, M's lines were transferred to the Minister of Defence and Bill Tanner, M's Chief of Staff.    Later, the new `M' was announced to be a female, Judi Dench beginning with Pierce Brosnan as the new James Bond in the newest James Bond film, `GoldenEye'. Personally I liked Judi Dench taking over the role of `M' after Bernard Lee. The writers at that time had seemed to give her a `personality', as well as a more active role other than just sitting behind a desk, which was refreshing, and complimented Pierce Brosnan in his new role as James Bond.    As much as the writers and producers wanted to remake the very first James Bond film, Casino Royale, Bernard Lee couldn't have been the original `M' after his passing in 1981, so the role was given to the current `M', Judi Dench, which although being a good `M', didn't match the time line of the James Bond series. Judi Dench continues her role as `M' in `Quantum of Solace'.    So okay now, the producers of the James Bond films, after years of negotiations got to remake Casino Royale with a younger actor to coincide with the time line of the era. Time to move on... bring back the previous writers, directors, and most of all Pierce Brosnan, as `James Bond'.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I loved this movie.  I laughed, at times I teared up. I have enjoyed watching it over and over. Great Job Disney, and Actors.
1878424602|5.0|A great book that reminds us that the forces that drive happiness and success aren't measurable in every day terms. It's measurable in the way we conduct our lives in every day decisions.    Trusting in the Universe is the hard part, surrender and truly trust despite circumstances. Running back to old habits is the only reason why this book won't adjust your life in ways you didn't think possible.    Take a deep breath, apply the concepts in every area in your life and see what sticks. Your world will be transformed as you unlock the potential of yourself and those around you.    You'll get what you put into it.
0316010669|5.0|I had to read this for an MBA course, strange as it may sound for someone going for an advanced degree in business, I've always been into philosophy and religion.  Though it has a ting of new-age-iness to it,  it really is both an informative and fun read.  I really did get alot out of it, I don't know that it caused any sea change in my belief system, but it made me think and more open..
6304698682|5.0|First of all, let me say that this is a superb movie.  The acting is spot-on from top to bottom and the cinematography is wonderful.  The story is simple enough: Eastwood plays a drifter who takes up with some miners in their battle with a gold-grubbing robber baron, played very well by Richard Dysart. As things heat up, Eastwood's \\"Preacher\\" character (both in name and dress) is forced to re-embrace his gunslinging past.  The actions scenes are well-choreographed, but -- for me, anyway -- the end represented a very slight disappointment in that it resorted to the \\"invincible gunslinger\\" finale.  Yes, satisfying, but ringing a little hollow considering the legitimate grittiness of the rest of the movie.    Quite a few people have paralleled this story to that of \\"High Noon.\\"  I tend to take another perspective.  I see him simply as an older version of \\"the man with no name.\\"  When Eastwood made this movie, he was 55 years old.  Think about the younger version and then age that character another 20 years (the time between Pale Rider and his spaghetti westerns). What would he be like?  Would he have settled down and bought himself a place -- as he told Mortimer in \\"For a Few Dollars More\\"?  Would he have become another Mortimer twenty years hence (although Mortimer obviously had some breeding and book intelligence -- something Eastwood's \\"street smart\\" gunslinger lacked)?  Another Sentenza?    Or would he simply have ended up a man who failed in everything except killing other men?  What would his character be like after killing for another 20 years?  An aging man who never found love, never found family, never found peace -- doomed to ride the plains endlessly, running from his past and not knowing where he will end up?  Keep in mind that a 55-year old person back then was considered elderly.  And Eastwood looks the 55...weary of killing, but unable to stop the cycle.    In the end his character rides off, perhaps for the last time.  Will there be any pallbearers athis funeral?  Will he even have a funeral?  Or will he end up buried in a \\"potter's grave\\" -- like so many of the men he shot?  A victim when his speed with a gun finally fails him...    Ladd's \\"High Noon\\" character could have, and might actually have, settled down to a normal life.  But Eastwood's \\"lone wolf\\" character couldn't have.  He truly would have been alone at the end.
031606792X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't wait to see how the story ends. I read it quickly. However, I lingered on the last few chapters due to the fact that I didn't want it to end. I am about go to back to book 1 and read them all over again. I cannot wait for all the movies to be made. I would recommend this to anyone who loved Twilight. The only bad thing is that now I'm left wanting more.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Never had I experienced a book and wonder where the point of the story becomes clear. Yet, I read the entire book and enjoyed the author's view by looking at people and patterns that influence their success/failure. I'm 50, and keep trying to look at the world differently. This helps me keep up with our fast changing world. A nice read for someone that rarely finishes a book. Recommended.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|Oskar is a lonely, bullied 12-year-old boy, waif-thin, who lives with his single mother in a run-down apartment in 1982 Sweden.  One night while playing out in the snow, he encounters his new neighbor, Eli, a pale young girl who lives with a mysterious old man who goes out late at night.  The two kids become fast friends, but little does Oskar know that Eli has been twelve years old for quite some time now...<br /><br />\\"Let the Right One In\\" is a spectacular horror movie.  It's not your typical Hollywood fair; there's quite a bit of gore, yes, and it's definitely disgusting, but blood is never used gratuitously--it's all to enhance the atmosphere, which is what propels the film forward.  Granted, an emphasis upon atmosphere means a slower plot.  Viewers used to more standard horror movies will become bored; even hardened viewers of atmospheric films might shuffle in their seat on occasion.<br /><br />The wait is well-worth it, however.  \\"Let the Right One In\\" isn't scary so much as it is deeply disturbing; it's as much a psychological horror movie, which is usually the best kind of horror.  It seeps under your skin, letting the real horror of this budding friendship sneak up on you, until you suddenly realize: \\"Holy crap, he's best friends with a blood-thirsty creature!\\"  The center of the film is the friendship between the two children, a relationship that is as creepy as it is touching.  It won't be long until Hollywood gets its hands on this film and completely ruins it; thus, I highly recommend you see the movie as it is, and be prepared to spend a few hours afterwards wondering if you should be touched or terrified by this compelling, elegant, intelligent horror film.
031606792X|4.0|I thought this book was VERY interesting. I was disappointed by the abrupt, boring ending though.
B001QC7DY2|3.0|This movie was fair, definitely not great. Once you see the previews, you basically know all there is to know (especially if you read any of the newspaper articles about the real-life story) and you've also seen the best acting in the entire movie. Angelina goes through the picture with a dazed look most of the time and never quite rises to the level of indignation that you would expect.    I'm glad I only paid $3.99 to rent it online versus paying $10 in the movie theater. Thank goodness Jolie did not win an oscar. Her role just didn't live up to the hype.

0786838655|5.0|This is an exciting and entertaining book!  It was really hard for me to put it down.  I also had to go and get the rest of the series right away.  I would recommend it for adults and kids!  If you are a conscientious parent that likes to know what your kids are reading (kudos to you!): This book is about the illegitimate, half human/half god children of Greek gods and the interactions they have with the normal world, the gods, and numerous mythological monsters.  This brings up a few interesting topics for discussion that you might want to have with your child before or while they read the book: 1) Pros and cons of having children out of wedlock 2) What you believe about the afterlife 3) The fact that characters in the book offer the gods food offerings and talk to the gods (it doesn't seem like worship to me, but it might to some).  I've only read the first book in the series so far and I am just starting the second.  There is a boy/girl friendship started in the first book that carries through to the second.  It is not romantic in nature so far, but you never know where that will go.  Over all, being a teacher, I am touched that the lead character, due to his parentage, was marked as a troubled child with ADHD but discovered his talents, intrinsic worth, and real friendship through his adventures.  Also, as I always like to say, it is always best for parents to read books before their kids do!  You just can't trust books anymore just because they are marketed to teens or young adults!
630471193X|5.0|I hadn't seen Phenomenon in several years. I always liked it, but the most recent viewing was the most satisfying. The mental powers thing was what made it interesting the first time I saw it, but now I take that aspect as a device for getting to the central theme (at least for me) of how to be gentle with people even in circumstances where one might become angry, bitter, vindictive, or even \\"superior\\".
B001UOVP1S|5.0|Chris Cornell delivers another fantastic album which is by far the best release 2009 has seen so far.  This is not Soundgarden, Audioslave, Temple of the Dog, or the traditional Cornell solo material...  This is a new sound from the grunge god that absolutely works in his favor.  The album art says it all!  Buy this album and keep an open mind, you will love it.
0805066691|5.0|There are things that happen during ones life that can have a profound impact on the way you think and how you treat other living beings.  This book had that impact with me.  I am a 54 year old Black Man with a small amount of Cherokee mixed in.  While growing up in this country I was taught that Indians were/are savages and they got everything that they deserved.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  After having lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico for three years I have found the Indian to be the most noble of people.  I have read this book two times now and I hope I read it a few more times before my time is up.  This book taught me how to be a much more giving person than I was before I read it.  It showed me that all living creatures are important and that we are all here for a reason.  Last but not least it showed me that America still has a lot to learn about treating people that think and act differently than we do.  I urge everyone to read this book, but be prepared for sleepless nights.
0321525655|5.0|This book seems to present a bit of a paradox. It is a book about slides. Reynolds admires Tufte. Tufte has written scathing words about Power Point. [[ASIN:0961392150 The Cognitive Style of Power Point]] & [[ASIN:0961392142 The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd edition]] How can this be? In short, they agree on a critical point. Don't let your slides try to be documents, and if you have to write a document, do so, and don't make slides. The two authors differ in style and emphasis, and their topics are entirely different, but essentially they agree. Tufte suggests that short \\"pitches\\" are trivial in content, and therefore not worth his commentary or time. He thinks that a presentation rich in details, rich in content, should be accompanied with technical reports. Reynolds would agree. So if you that is your goal, seek out Tufte. Reynolds would argue you should be doing a report, not slides. If, on the other hand, you need to make a \\"pitch\\", or need to do a high level overview, or need to present at a corporate meeting, you need this book. It is a tough competition between this book and Duarte's. [[ASIN:0596522347 slide:ology: The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations]] I prefer this one. It is highly visual and reads like a extended series of magazine articles, while keep you thinking. In a couple of sections, it feels like a bunch of blogs posts, strung together. This is not endemic, so it never became too distracting. Another reviewer's critique that it is \\"light\\" is fair, but in my case it made it more effective. It is not as detailed as Duarte's, but if you are looking for inspiration more than instruction, an interlocutor of sorts, this delivers. Compared to this, Duarte's feel like a text book, albeit a very good one. The two authors know each other, and have presented together. Presentation Zen will convince you to be a little brave, and try a few new things. I experimented with stock photos as a result of reading this book. It will also talk you out of doing what you know will fail, but find yourself doing anyway, in an attempt to be like everyone else. Finally, upon completing this book, I became utterly persuaded on one key point: never, ever print a slide deck. It never works. Instead, produce a document that is designed to be read (not projected on a screen) to accompany the slides, and to be given after the talk.<br /><br />Read Presentation Zen.

B001FBSMF8|2.0|I tried to keep an open mind after all the harsh reviews and grades from other Cornell fans, but frankly it didn't really work. There are bits and pieces of Scream that I might be able to like in another reality, but I live in THIS reality and Timbaland's production is just too monotonous for my tastes. I've thought that Cornell's been in something of a rut of late and this album hasn't done anything to alter that opinion.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a bitch getting older, Chris. Shame you couldn't have just stuck with the dirty blues played out with the second half of 'Watch Out'...you could've had a hell of an album as a result. Instead what we have is a milquetoast, forgettable and monotone drone for vast majority of the material, and little sense of any redeeming value or worth for repeat listening.

Neither on the organ nor on the clavier could he have worked out the architecture of a movement with such vitality; the orchestra alone permits him absolute freedom in the leading and grouping of the obbligato voices.\\"<br /><br />The above quotation (by Albert Schweitzer) is found on the inner case containing this DVD that has not only the music of Johann Sebastian Bach's (1685 to 1750) six Brandenburg concertos or concerti but also shows the musicians creating this music.<br /><br />These concertos are considered by many the most beautiful and best known from the Baroque period (1600 to 1750). Baroque composers produced two types of concerto: the solo concerto and the concerto grosso.  The concerto grosso was based on the opposition between a small group of instruments (the concertino), and a larger group (the tutti or ripieno).<br /><br />Bach captured the spirit of the concerto grosso, in which two groups vie with each other in what might be described as \\"sonorous flights of fancy,\\" in his six Brandenburg Concertos.

0783226837|5.0|Sure, this film isn't Citizen Kane or Gone with the Wind, but it's one hell of a wild ride! This horror/comedy isn't very satirical or symbolic: the residents of Perfection, Nevada, are being attacked by \\"Graboids,\\" which are humongous meat-eating worms that live underground, and everyone including Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward must destroy these beasts before they digest every single person in the town. I was very amused with this film: the special effects and the distinctive characters are what drives this one. Lots of high tension and black humor all around. It's a definite cult classic.<br /><br />Grade: A
1932100660|3.0|This book is an informative read that has helped encourage me to move towards healthier eating due to it's strong arguments and research-based advice. The problem is simple: The author wants you to be vegan. I have no problem with vegan or vegetarian lifestyles. On average, I am a vegetarian six or seven days a week (I rarely eat meat, whereas I used to eat meat daily). So I am not taking issue with the idea of veganism or vegetarianism. They are personal choices and I support anyone who chooses such a diet (or who chooses to not have such a diet). So what's my problem?    Simply, this book demands near veganism. Despite the evidence saying that those who primarily eat fish live the longest, Campbell still encourages veganism, *not* fished-based diets. I hate fish and I am allergic to many kinds of seafood, so it's not even an option for me. Campbell begrudgingly allows the suggestion that eating some fish is okay, but that you shouldn't have it often... and that if you can live without fish, you absolutely should (despite Campbell pointing out that people who eat fish-based diets live the longest--where is the logic?).    The evidence is clear that meat-based diets are not healthy and meat eaters have the highest mortality rates (and cancer rates and coronary heart disease rates). But I find it hard to follow the advice of someone who so clearly wants me to be a vegan. If Campbell wanted the reader to cut back on meat as much as possible, that's fine. But to completely remove it from the diet is a drastic measure that is not supported by fact. The group of people who live the second longest includes vegetarians and \\"flexitarians\\" (people who eat meat occasionally). Vegans live even less time (although still more than meat eaters).    It is absolutely puzzling to me how Campbell can recommend veganism despite the fact that his own book rates vegans as the second-highest mortality rate.    I have trashed the main position of the book quite a bit, but there is still alot of useful information on nutrition and scientific reductionism to be found within it. But as a book, it's hard to read when the author clearly has a bias based on personal values, not facts.
B000002A3T|4.0|The Division Bell being Pink Floyd's 1994 release and their last studio album to date and was a massive hit peaking at #1 in the UK, USA, Norway and Australia. Songs that I especially like are \\"Keep Talking\\", \\"High Hopes\\", \\"Lost for Words\\" and \\"What Do You Want from Me\\". I am not a fan of modern art so I do not understand the booklet. But the lyrics are easy to read and we get a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5.
B000654YRY|5.0|There are too few Dire Straits DVD's out their. This one i've seen maybe 50 times. The songs, quality, and camera location are outstanding. Could have been longer though.
B000002U8G|4.0|Meddle being the progressive rock band Pink Floyd's 1971 release and was a major hit peaking at #3 in the UK album charts. \\"One of These Days\\"/\\"Fearless\\" was the single in the US/Italy. In Japan the track Fearless was replaced with Seamus. The booklet sure is a mixed bag. Very nice photos are mixed with confounding art. The lyrics are very easy to read and in the beginning we get a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5.
B00021R7CG|5.0|I worked with Charlie Mullen (DP for Lucasfilm and Boeing) and I've been in lust -- er, love -- with the delicious Rebecca De Mornay forEVER, and visually speaking this was a spectacular bit of work. It's not as deep as \\"Fail-Safe\\" nor quite as action-packed (or silly) as \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" but having worked with Charlie (see \\"Cocoon\\", \\"*batteries not included\\", etc.) and knowing how seriously he takes his work, I know that this was a GREAT film, for technical artists and others to appreciate, for the work that he and Craig Barron and everyone else at MatteWorld contributed. This deserved the Emmies they won, it's a bad script and dumb story, but EXCEPTIONAL visual effects. And I'd love to have Ms. De Mornay in my right-seat ANY DAY! (At least the B52s in this film didn't cast a shadow of a B-17 on the landscape!)
B000T05R90|4.0|The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (40th Anniversary Edition) being Pink Floyd's 1967 release and their debut album is a classic example of psychadelic rock and sounds as experimental as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys. The album did quite well in the UK album charts and peaked at #6. The booklet is typical 60's psychadelia and the lyrics are quite strange but easy to read. 4/5.
B001RMMM2O|5.0|If you think post modern music has lost subtly and brevity, this is worth a listen. Large washes of guitar and piano melody surround an honest vocal that sings tasteful reserved lyrics. Tastefully mixed. It seems as though lots of attention was put into simple musical ideas rather then large inflated, often risky, aesthetic details. I won't call it rock, but I also won't stamp it vaguely with the stigma of \\"indie.\\" Great Album.
B0000026NC|4.0|Delicate Sound of Thunder being a live album by Pink Floyd and was recorded over 5 nights at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, New York in August 1988 and mixed at Abbey Road Studios in September 1988. The album was a massive success and peaked at #11 both in the UK album charts and on the billboard 200. In Norway it did even better and peaked at #2 in the album charts. Here we get classic tracks such \\"Shine on you crazy diamond\\", \\"Another brick in the wall (Part II)\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\". 4/5.
031606792X|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to read the Twilight series simply due to the fact that I'm not always comfortable reading a book in 1st person format. However, I shouldn't have concerned myself. I truly enjoyed the Twilight series, as they were written incredibly well. And this book was easily the best in the series, although Twilight (book 1) comes pretty close.     It's also surprising that I liked them, as I absolutely HATE Romeo and Juliet, Wuthering Heights, Pride and Prejudice, etc. However, the auther did an excellent job of not allowing any silly tragic love story to get out of hand. Just enough to keep it interesting, but not so much that it took over an otherwise excellent story.     As for the specifics of the story, I won't give anything away, but I'll try to break it down a bit: The book is essentially in three parts.     # Book one is still in Bella's point of view, and she's still human. It talks of her marriage, honeymoon and pregnancy.     # Book two was in Jacob's view and talks about Bella's pregnancy, the rift between the wolves, the birth of Bella and Edwards child, and describes how Edward turns her. Personally, I could have done without this section (other than the turning section).     # Book three begins with Bella in the process of turning, and go on to talk about her first couple of months as a Vampire. This section is easily the best part of the entire series, and the first few chapters of this section were actually some of the best reading I've ever encountered, and that's saying something. It shows how absolutely happy she is and how extraordinarily powerful she becomes.     All in all, a fantastic series with an even better ending. Yes, I know how so many people are upset in how everyone got what they wanted. So what! It may not be practical, but we're talking supernatural here, anyway, so so what - don't be a masochist :-). This is the way a series should end!     Here's a couple of other notes that I thought about that might make some people understand why there's so much differnce between the views of this book:     1. This series transcended two very distinct genres: Science Fiction/Fantasy and Romance. Not easy to do well, but the author did do it well. However, here's the catch - the first three books were pretty much romance novels with a bith of Vampire/Werewolf fantasy thrown in. The fourth book, however, was the complete opposite. It was essentially a fantasy book with a bit of romance thrown in. Now for those sci-fi readers like me, it was an excellent happenstance, as we got through the first three books however we may, the fourth one was a nice desert. However, for the romancer readers who read the first three books with adoration, the fourth one might just seem as a pretty big comedown.     2. Soem numskull came out and gloatingly stated that the author'll never make another book in Bella's view because it's sales did terrible and the publishers would never allow it. The only thing I really need to ask about that person is exactly which drugs they're taking. The book sold over 2.4 million copies, and is currently #4 on Amazon even with all the negative reviews. (yes, I know, Midnight Sun is on the way)     3. There are over 4000 reviews on Amazon, and while there are many negative, it is still almost 4 stars. That means that, regardless of what some people feel, the majority of people, like me, truly did enjoy the book, and that means that hopefully the author will make a sequel to it, although I'd probably guess that it's in Renesmee's point of view.
B000002C1W|5.0|A Momentary Lapse of Reason being Pin Floyds 1987 release and their first album after Roger Waters left the band is a real dandy of album. It was a huge smash hit and reached #3 on the UK album charts and the billboard 200. Tracks such as \\"Learning to Fly\\", \\"On the Turning Away\\", \\"The Dogs of War\\" and \\"One Slip\\" make for one stupendous album. The cd booklet has some strange photos but the lyrics are easy to read and at the beginning we get a nice list of whom plays what on the album. 5/5.
B00009ATKS|5.0|An album of savage beauty, incredible dissonances and buildups that peak with the utterly staggering 'Ratts of the Capital.'   This is the album that made me forever a fan of Mogwai. It's the most complete work they've ever come out with and an album I'd consider to be one of my absolute favorites. Very, very highly recommended.
B000002UA5|4.0|Ummagumma being Pink Floyd's 1969 release is a 2 disc progressive album with the first one being a live album and the second one contains individual compositions by the members of the band. The album did really well in the UK Album charts and peaked at #5. The booklet is quite strange and looks like they threw this together in a couple of hours. The photos are grainy, and on the whole it informs not much information that is usefull nor interesting which is a shame. 4/5.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|\\"I Will Be\\" is not on this version of this CD.  It's not on the CD nor the DVD, which has just an interview and a photo gallery.  Someone else reviewed that it was here, and I read that it was supposed to be this edition.  It seems to be on the Special Edition.    So I want to make clear if there's a confusion for other readers.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|For a man in his mid 70's to perform a show as excellent as this is astounding.    Great songs, great band, great show.    A legend demonstrating why he is one.
B000TXG3YA|4.0|These guys get compared a lot to Mastodon and Isis and for good reason.  Similar to Mastodon, these guys trace their roots to both Georgia and New York.  Similar to Isis, the band's frontman, John Dyer Baizley, is a budding entrepreneur in the independent music scene.  Similar to both bands, Baroness explores that post metal/sludge rock sound pioneered by Neurosis and later enhanced upon by many contemporary indie metal acts.    That's however, where the comparisons should rightfully stop.    Unlike Mastodon, Baroness doesn't throw an entire assault of musicianship down your throat.  Unlike Isis, Baroness doesn't venture into droning metal for 9 minutes.  Instead, Baroness takes a simpler approach, blending in anthemic hard rock with sludge metal while keeping the songs at a moderate length.  It goes back and forth from some very light and nature-esque moments to overdriven fury in an almost seamless fashion.  The whole album is great; my personal favorites are \\"The Birthing\\", \\"Wailing Wintry Wind\\",  \\"Cockroach en Fleur\\", and \\"O'Appalachia\\".    This is one of the most rockin' albums put out in a while and I see why everyone's big on it.  That said, I definitely say it's one of the better rock albums to have come out in some time and strongly recommend it to fans of rock, metal, and punk music.
0553573411|5.0|Ever since I first read Lord of the Rings, I was hooked on fantasy. Since that fateful day many years ago I have read many of the conventional fantasy series most notably the Wheel of Time series. This trilogy really breaks all bonds of convention and makes way for innovation, creativity, and a strong dose of realism. The characters in these stories feel so real it will take your breath away. Never have I ever been so emotionally involved in a character as I was with Fitz. I literally could not wait to pick up the book again after putting it down to find out what direction he would be thrust in next, and whether or not he would get out of it.    At first, I did not think I would enjoy reading the first-person narrative style of Hobb's writing, but now I actually find it quite enjoyable and adds a whole dimension to the story and further connection to the character. Her structure is fantastic. Even when things may seem a bit slow, it is done for a reason, usually because you begin to feel anxious and impatient just as the narrator is.    These books are definitely page turners that are well worth a read.  One of my favorite fantasy series to date. I look forward to reading the rest of the adventures of Fitzchivalry Farseer.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|After a shaky first episode this series just kept getting better and better. You don't have to have read or be a fan of the books to enjoy this, though, of course, it helps to already have a background on characters, even if you know what's to come. It doesn't follow the books exactly and the first season didn't just follow the first book if that is what people are thinking. I found myself getting addicted very fast and quite easily. I couldn't get enough and couldn't wait for the next episode. It is funny, suspenseful, sexy and sad, sometimes all in one episode. Sookie is not always the most likable of main characters, but overall you care for her and her welfare. Acting is actually very good too, which is a relief. Each character is interesting and unique and gets a lot more attention than they do in the books since it is centered around Sookie and told in first person. Has VERY strong language and even worse for sex, but I recommend to any vampire fan and a fan of the books.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Well, first off a brief explanation of the video itselt.  There are three levels: 1,2,3.  One is the easiest and each one gets harder.  They are said to be 20 minutes each, but when you add in her little bit of talking, warm-up and cool-down you are actually looking at about 27-28 minutes.  That was a bit of a let down for my time-crunch life, but no biggie.  You do 2 minutes of warm-up, then the work... 3 minutes of strength training (using dumbells), 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of ab work.  Repeat that 3 times and add a 2 minute cool down.  That may not seem like it's going to be  much of a challenge, but trust me, after you do one level you will know it is tough!  One of the biggest differences I've noticed between this and a lot of other workout videos is that there is NO REST.  You better hope you don't need a drink or your shoelaces come untied because you barely have time to get into position before she gets you going.  I noticed some people have made Jillian sound like a really hard person, but believe me, she is not without heart.  Yes, she moves you along and takes no excuses, but she encourages you at the same time.  I, personally, like her style.  I don't want someone to baby me through a workout.  And I agree with a lot of the philosophy she spurns out as you are working.  I've been working out steadily for 7 years now, and trust me, she is right.  If you ain't panting and feeling some burn in your muscles, you ain't going to see much difference.      Just so everyone knows, I'm not really doing this to lose weight.  My weight teeters between 110-115.  I workout to stay toned and healthy.  And also because my diet is not the best, so I need a little extra boost to help me maintain my weight.  This video has been a big help.  I've been doing it for about 2 weeks and I can feel myself getting stronger.  My abs actually look a little more defined too, and who doesn't want that?!      It's nice to have 3 levels to choose from because some days... after work... I'm not really feeling like a level 3, but some days I can handle it.    I have been combining this with other video, it's true because my body is used to working out for at least an hour each day.  I do everything from Taebo, to Pilates, to Yoga, to this.  Variety really is a key to keep from hitting plateaus and from getting bored.  Let's face it, if you are bored with a video or exercise routine, you aren't going to feel like doing it.  This video gives you 3 workouts to mix it up.  It's been a great addition to my collection.  Thank you Jillian.  I will be looking into more videos created by her.  I like her style!  Good luck to all.  I truly believe if your goal is to lose weight from doing this, it will help as long as you are watching what you eat too.
0143038419|4.0|The premise of the book seemed contrived - young woman recovering from divorce and heartbreak goes on pre-planned odyssey around the world and finds herself.  I didn't expect to like it, but I was surprised to find that Gilbert's writing was enjoyable, intelligent, and absorbing, and she offers some useful insights into the eternal struggle for self-acceptance and serenity.    Whether you love or hate this book will probably depend on how you react to Gilbert's personality, which comes through vividly. She's like an enthusiastic, emotional puppy - impulsive, ebullient, people-person, loving everyone and everything, curling up and whimpering when she's hurt.  I had to admit while reading the book I kept thinking: this woman is very different from me.  But nonetheless I enjoyed the ride - travel fantasy through three wonderful locations; getting into Gilbert's head and experiencing the world through her own unique vision.     This type of book is all about putting yourself in the shoes of the author and imagining yourself having the experiences that she writes about. Along with Gilbert's prose - in turns reflective, enthusiastic, and ironic - what's not to like about studying Italian and eating great food in Rome, meditating at an Ashram in India, and finding friendship and love in Bali?      That she's able to tie it up neatly like a bow at the end of the story - well, maybe there's some contrivance - real life is usually messier and leaves unfinished business.  But an author also has the right to choose the details that will make for a good narrative.  Overall, I'd recommend this to most women; not sure if it would appeal as much to men.
0312383320|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Laughed out loud.  I was a little hesitant to buy the book given the reviews I read, but am glad I did.

B001N18HOQ|5.0|Remaster the original 1991 album to perfection,add a second disc which features a great 2008 Brendan O'Brein remix that strips away the dated reverb of the original mix and makes Eddie Vedder's vocals clearer and more upfront,gives the guitars additional bite and edge and adds kick and punch to the bass and drums.Include outtakes and demos,\\"Brother\\" being the standout with the slowed-down \\"State Of Love And Trust\\" being a close second.Contain all of the 1992 \\"MTV Unplugged\\" performance (availble for the first time on DVD)and compliment it with stellar picture and sound quality.(BTW, all discs were mastered by the talented Bob Ludwig.)Finish off with a nostalgic,colorful booklet and you've got a great,entertaining package worth its high price.Bravo!
B0017I1FNK|5.0|All I intended to Be is no doubt one of Emmylou's finest gifts- to herself, to you, to me.  This is a redemptive work, I sit in awe and admiration as I listen, as I sing along.  Not many in our wake can move one's spirit from up so high to down so low, to burn but not break us- this dear lady, the Mother of Redemption- teaches well the beauty of brokenness.    White Sands breaks(open) my heart.  Five stars truly is not fortune enough to bestow on All I Intended to Be.
B00009RDGA|4.0|When Addie Loggins (Tatum O'Neal) is orphaned, she is sent away with a traveling swindler named Moses who could possibly be her father (Ryan O'Neal) to find her aunt and uncle in St. Jo. At the start of their journey, Moses cons $200 out of a local resident, but Addie is convinced the money is rightfully hers. In order to earn back the money he already spent, Moses takes Addie with him on a quest to get money, a quest that lasts many months. Along the way, they meet some very interesting people, including a showgirl named Trixie Delight (Madeline Kahn).<br /><br />As a fan of black and white movies, I was surprised to find how stifling the use of black and white is in this movie, perhaps an allusion to the desperation of the Great Depression era. We see evidence of how poor people are, like the travelling migrants looking for new homes out west. The use of music is in direct contrast to this sentiment; it is peppy and fun. Entertainment is escapism, like Jack Benny's radio program or the games at the carnival.<br /><br />The possible paternal relationship between Moses and Addie is supported by their similar jawline; this is because Ryan and Tatum are father and daughter in life. This casting choice turned out to be a stroke of genius and Tatum won the best supporting actress Oscar at the age of ten.

B001R4MEYI|5.0|Omg, Where do I begin? I have always loved Mastodon..Leviathan and Blood Mountain are 2 great pieces of Metal/Rock and I always knew they had something extra in there sick twisted brains of theres, It was MELODY. This album is vintage Mastodon with a new Twist..Songs are all diff ranging from 4 min - 13 min, everything from Classic rock to Heavy Metal and everything inbetween. Sit down, listen to this album straight through. Huge contender for album of 2009 and I have a feeling it'll be an All-Time Favorite of mine. It grows on me with each listen and it's simply impossible to get sick of, not to mention the Trippy album cover...Buy It
B0013FNC38|5.0|This young talent is one of the very best artists I have heard in my sixty-two years on this earth.  His singing style is unique and his song writing is well thought out.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|There are many reviews on here that say that whichever you are exposed to first, the book or the movie, is the one that you prefer in the end. As someone who read the book first, I have to say that they both have their strong merits. The book is rich in detail, and the writing itself is outstanding, and worth reading out of context just for its style. However, I must say that the music and visuals of the BBC film bump it past the book on my list. This is easily one of the best films I have ever seen. I would recommend reading the book first, just so you have an idea where some things come from (ie the sudden move to Milton, which isn't immediately clear in the film), but the film is definitely worth seeing over and over again. What a timeless tale! My thanks to Elizabeth Gaskell and BBC!
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Gran Torino begins and ends in a church. In between is a tale of bitterness, reawakening, revenge, and ultimately redemption. In other words, this is a Clint Eastwood film.     Gran Torino is a very well done movie, made by one of the most effective directors in Hollywood; if it covers some familiar ground, it is also a departure from this turf. In control on both sides of the camera, Eastwood plays an embittered Korean war veteran, Walt Kowalski, whose wife has just died as the film begins.     Even without his wife's death, Walt could never be accused of being a happy man. He resents his changing Detroit neighborhood and the influx of minorities, personified by the Hmong immigrants who live next door to him. He resents his two sons and their families, especially his spoiled, shallow grandchildren (to Walt's credit I resented them a bit myself; the movie is not interested in making them exactly multifaceted, unless you define multifaceted as managing to be unpleasant, vulgar, and insensitive all at the same time).     If Walt was a more articulate person, there is no doubt he would voice his resentment of America's decline in general, embodied by the decline of the once-great Motor City. He spends his days sitting on his porch, sipping an endless succession of Pabst Blue Ribbon cans, and offering a running commentary, to no one in particular, on the sorry state of affairs.     Meantime, Thao Vang Lor, the teenager who lives next door, finds himself facing his own troubles, as he is pressured by his gang-leader cousin to abandon his books in favor of automatic weapons, aimless driving, and other trappings of gang life. Peer-pressured into attempting to steal his reclusive next-door neighbor's prized Gran Torino, Thao predictably flubs the robbery and is nearly shot by Walt in the process.     The event causes Walt to sit up and take a sharper look at the troubles around him. And little by little - and yet somehow overnight - he becomes a not-especially reluctant protector of the very family whose presence he complained about so lengthily. Sounds familiar? Sure. This is Eastwood territory, and we delight to see him enter it, for no one does it better. Perhaps more than any other actor, Eastwood carries his iconic status with him, in every role he plays. It is unavoidably a part of him - every jaded, raspy word, the grizzled, seen-it-all features, the corded arms and piercing eyes and the slouching confidence he feels for his own two hands and not much else. He could not abandon this if he tried, and we do not want him to.     Seeing three teenage bullies harassing the daughter of the family on her way home from school, Walt watches from his truck, growing increasingly incensed. What follows is no less delightful for the predictability of the track it follows. The truck pulls up, a man gets out. The teenagers bluster and advise him to move on. \\"Every now and then,\\" Walt replies, \\"you run into a guy you shouldn't have f--ked with. I'm that guy.\\"     Yup, we're in Eastwood Country, all right. And it's good to be there.     As the film goes on, the violence increases as Walt's heart opens slowly, reluctantly, once again, and he is drawn into the life of his neighbors, who hail him as a savior. There are many nice moments here, and these are made more poignant by the shadow which Walt oh-so-willingly moves under. Eastwood can be wonderfully grouchy when he wishes, and the scenes where the two Hmong children try to draw him out of his shell have a light, pleasant feel to them, even if occasionally a gesture or line ring slightly false.     But the good times are not here to stay. This is an Eastwood film, and Eastwood doesn't believe in happy endings. Or, for that matter, peaceful ones. And soon enough an act of loathsome brutality on the part of the gang members spurs Walt into a savage, guilt-ridden consciousness that the semi-playful violence he has so enjoyed flirting with has produced real and insufferable consequences for thoseclosest to him. And with that realization, he heads off to a climax as unavoidable as that in any Western.      Eastwood is older, now, and his body, although still strong, is less vital than in some of his past iconic roles. And so we can only hope that there is enough of Harry Callahan or William Munny left in him to succeed. Does he? Yes, and no. And the ending is a strikingly un-Eastwoodesque ending - until one considers for a moment, and decides that maybe it is a quintessential Eastwood ending after all.     On the other side of the camera, Eastwood turns in a strong performance (does he know any other kind?) but not a true tour de force. In his defense, the script doesn't allow him this chance - while strong, it does not seem particularly inclined to take him into challenging or uncharted waters. Nonetheless, the machine called Clint Eastwood is going strong, and unlike the Motor City itself, he shows no signs of slowing down.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This is truly a remarkable horror experience. A very rare catch that could only be made in Europe.<br /><br />Young Lucie escapes from captivity and grows up tormented by her experiences. She is continuously haunted by a creature that preys on her. At the institution where she lives, she befriends another girl, Anna. Fast forward 15 years and Lucie discovers the people who tortured her as a child. She gets her revenge with the help of Anna... who's in for the discovery/experience of a lifetime.<br /><br />It all seems pretty vague, I know, but I do not want to spoil the ending - which is by far one of the most fascinating endings I've ever seen - because it is, perhaps, the most ironic ending ever for a horror film!<br /><br />The philosophical nature of the plot - that becomes clear halfway through is beautifully written and calculated and the Mademoiselle character is truly frightening! Contrary to what people may say, the violence and gore presented here - although over the top - is NOT gratuitous. They serve the narrative. The violence and gore are essential to what the characters in the plot are trying to achieve. And it is up to the viewer to endure it.<br /><br />The ending will simply leave everyone with their mouth open... and make clear the ultimate irony.<br /><br />This is a film that, somehow, could never have come up in Hollywood. The Europeans have done it again!<br /><br />Nobody today makes horror films like the Europeans. This film is unique!

Yeshua (Jesus) said there is not greater love than giving his own life for others, and this is exactly what He did for me and the entire human race...

B001PPLIFU|5.0|This is an interesting evolution of the Bond franchise. This film really moves more toward the Bourne Identity series, or could be considered an interesting branch on the Bond tree. There's a bit more intelligent intrigue, more political in this Bond than previous efforts. There's still a ton of action, the chases are simply awesome and exciting. As always, production values are top notch. The editing and tension build is outstanding. This is what action films are all about.<br /><br />The gadgets are all gone. They were more or less in Casino Royale. The advanced technology had a very real ring to it, tracking with a GPS receiver, the big glass touch screens, all the other tech gadgets rung very true. The car chases were spot on to most action films. The urban building jump chases were impressive and kept this viewer on the edge of his seat. None of the sequences necessarily jumped the shark, none screamed, no way this couldn't happen.<br /><br />The Bond girl has evolved also. She's now a firm, strong woman that can defend herself. Infinitely more attractive than those demure eye candy women. This is really much more interesting than the previous generations.<br /><br />Blu-Ray - this disc is without question a reference disc. The opening montage is more than enough to prove that to anyone. This film requires a beautifully calibrated screen, well tuned subwoofer, and correctly placed speakers. The house will rattle. The dynamic range is incredible. Frankly, the at home experience with a good system is so much better than the movie theater. Visually and sonically this disc rivals everything movie theater. Add to that nobody talking, getting your own snacks for low cost, and this is a total winner. In many ways, Quantum of Solace is the reason Blu-Ray was invented. Buy this, watch it over and over again, especially after the system has been calibrated.<br /><br />PG-13, there are some senuous scenes. No frontal nudity, but a lot of suggestion. As with all the other Bond films, there's a level of senuality in many scenes. The opening montage has some nude female sillouettes. There's a bit of language here and there. And many people are shot pretty vividly. Mostly all this is expected in a Bond film. It just bumps close to an R rating. Compare this to many films that are rated PG-13 that bump more toward PG, not in this case.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray disc has a number of special features. Most of it is really pretty lame. Some day real live serious good featurs will be packaged. It's a bunch of making of films. Even the clip on location shooting was just not great. At least the film is beautifully transferred and gorgeous on a well calibrated screen.<br /><br />Enjoy this film for it's high action, intelligent mystery, and beautiful production. It's fantastic entertainment, more in the Bourne vein.Bond films, there's a level of senuality in many scenes. The opening montage has some nude female sillouettes.

0307269752|5.0|Highly recommended by a friend...exceded recommendations.  What a spell binding, intertwining of stories and different types of characters!  Highly engaging.  This is the kind of book which you want to read rapidly because you want to find the answers...yet, at the same time, want to read slowly because you do not want it to end.  I am truly looking forward to the next Stieg Larsson book which is coming out at the end of June.  I almost went ahead and ordered it from Europe where it is already available in paperback, but I decided to wait for my hard back copy from Amazon.

B001B67VR2|5.0|By now, almost everyone knows who Rihanna is. She has become a worldwide superstar in just a few years. Year after year she just pumps out songs that will get drilled into your head and before you know it you'll be singing along. Rihanna is here to stay, and is that a good or bad thing?  Album Picks:    Umbrella (10/10): And infectious song that had the world chanting \\"ella ella ella, eh eh eh.\\" The heavy drums in the background coupled with Rihanna's ability to get it stuck in your head will either make you hate it or love it. It's a quality song, about staying faithful even through the worst of times. Beautiful!    Don't Stop The Music (9/10): No matter what, this song will make you dance. There is no meaning in the lyrics and it borrows from Micheal Jackson but that doesn't mean it's bad. One of the best songs on the album, and perfect for dancing.  Breakin' Dishes (8/10): A good song with a powerful beat. Rihanna is angry and while this isn't too convincing, it is still great! \\"I'mm fight a man tonight!\\"    Shut Up And Drive (8/10): The second song off the album, it borrows from \\"Blue Monday\\" and it is sounds great. The sexual meaning behind it and Rihanna's voice works flawlessly.    Disturbia (10/10): As pop as pop gets. The dark meaning and the synthesizer are perfect. An infectious song and great on the dance floor.    Good Girl Gone Bad (9/10): Surprisingly great, not what you'd expect. It's not about Rihanna becoming a bad girl but it's about a man mistreating a woman and she becomes bad.     Overall a great album and worth a purchase.

B001KPK6Q2|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out, as I did her 1st CD. This is a strong album you can rock your head n' heart to. It starts out with \\"fearless\\" a catchy, rockin' song about loving fearless, It sets the tone and concept of this album. \\"Fifteen\\" is a great song that i, honestly, can't listen to because I know it'll be in my head all day. Every song paints it's own picture and tells its own story. She is a unique talent in in that every song is unique.      What i really like, is her sound evolved(not changed). She got so much better. Her last album had some weak points, \\"i'm just a girl\\" wasn't exactly up there with \\"our song\\", but this album is full of songs, not only with a different vibe and meaning, but equally as good/catchy.       Another thing i'd like to point out is \\"slow-song's\\". When i buy an album i'm aware that they're going to be on the album, I'm concerned with A. Can this artist pull off slow songs? and B. How slow/boring are they going to be?... well, for the most part, the only slow songs \\"breath\\" which was co-written by Colbie Cailliet, who sang/wrote \\"bubbly\\" the other song is \\"you're not sorry\\" which is one of my favorite songs on the record, and her only piano driven song~and i love it. Finally \\"white horse\\" -which you've probably heard.    But, mainly, all her songs have a rockin', catchy, snappy vibe that can also catch you off guard and hit you emotionally(which is healthy). She's different, finally a not-so-typical country artist. Most everyone loves her, couldn't recommend it more, Fearless*****

B000IFS0HM|4.0|Angela's Ashes gave me a new appreciation for how good we have it here in America.  Even though my husband is looking for a job, we still have a safe, warm, comfortable place to live with plenty of food for our family.  I found myself thanking God for how blessed we are, even when it seems like life is tough.  It could be so much worse.      Angela's Ashes is well written and gives the \\"I'm right there\\" feeling.  The details give an excellent portrayal of life during the depression era...in Ireland.      My caution...I would not give this book to teens or younger.  Some of the sexual details are a little much...too much information!  I didn't need to know who was getting off and how they were getting off.  Beyond that excellent!
B00003CWPL|5.0|I first saw ERASERHEAD at a midnight screening at the Waverly in New York. That was 1978. I was 29 years old at the time. I didn't understand ERASERHEAD then, but the visuals and sounds totally blew me away, and even now, despite the great quality of this DVD, I still maintain that the full effect of the movie can't be appreciated unless experienced in a theater.    ERASERHEAD went through a number of revisions during it's 5 year period of conception, gestation, and birth. David Lynch, had arrived in Hollywood in 1970 to study film at the AFI's Institute for Advanced Film Studies. He had come from Philadelphia, where he went to art school, got married, and unexpectedly became a father. The ERASERHEAD project evolved from a much less ambitious idea. Lynch had already made a number of short animated movies and one combination live action/animated film (the Grandmother),and ERASERHEAD would be his first feature length live action movie. He produced, directed, wrote the script, designed the sets, edited, and mixed the sound of this unique film, which explores the darkest recesses of his then troubled mind, and gave free reign to his wild subconscious imaginings and powerful creative thought processes. Lynch, a child of the small town Pacific Northwest, was deeply affected by his experience in urban Philly. Besides trying to adjust to a dangerous (at times violent) environment that was the polar opposite of what he was accustomed to from childhood, his marriage to 1st wife Peggy, had started deteriorating due to his infidelities. The unplanned arrival of his daughter Jennifer, who was born with club feet, further complicated his life. Rather than collapse under the pressure of these dilemmas, Lynch used them as the source material for ERASERHEAD. The sense of environmental dread, and the conflict between responsibility as a spouse and parent, and responsibilty as a creative artist, vividly manifests itself in ERASERHEAD. Lynch has referred to ERASERHEAD as the real Philadelphia Story.    Henry Spencer, the troubled protaganist with the inflated hairdo, whose life is mechanically controlled by an ominous \\"man in a planet\\", is almost a cinematic doppelganger for Lynch himself. Henry solemnly treks through an unnamed industrial wasteland to have dinner with the strange family of his girlfriend Mary X. There he learns that he is the father of a deformed baby. He and Mary take the baby back to his apartment, where it's constant crying disturbs them. Mary X has had enough of the wailing monstrosity and leaves, so Henry alone must care for it, but the temptations of a sexy neighbor, and visions of a strange puffy cheeked blond lady who lives in his radiator and sings a song called \\"In Heaven\\" keep distracting him. The inspiration for the radiator lady came from Lynch's discovery of T.M. during the time he was making the film. She represents the means to an escape from a harsh \\"reality\\" into an enlightened state. At one point, he dreams he has entered the radiator to commune with her and winds up losing his head which is found by a boy and taken to a pencil factory where it is used as the material for erasers. The symbolism of the mind's ability through meditation to erase a false reality in favor of a heightened consciousness is too obvious to ignore. Henry's squeamish destruction of the baby who symbolized all his troubles in a sick, deformed world, is followed by that iconic image of him, hair ablaze, surrounded by a field of charged particles, as the radiator lady joins him in an embrace that illuminates the screen in white light and abruptly ends in darkness. The \\"man in the planet\\" is no longer in control. Henry's mind (spirit) has left his physical body to commune with eternity.    ERASERHEAD was originally 2 1/2 hours long. Lynch pared it down to it's present 90 minute running time for general release. In it we find the dark humor, weird characters, and foreboding use of light, darkness, and sound, that will be hallmarks of later projects. After it's original screening in Hollywood, David Lynch's mother reportedly said to him \\"God, honey. What have I done?\\" What she did, was give birth to a creative genius.

1592533868|5.0|Quilling, or the art of paper filigree doesn't require much in the way of expensive tools.  You could even start off with narrow strips from a mini paper shredder (the author's suggestion), plus glue, scissors, tweezers, straight pins, and something to roll the paper strips around, such as a toothpick or an awl.<br /><br />\\"The Art of Paper Quilling\\" is a good guide to start with, and it is also the most beautiful quilling book I've had the opportunity to read.  Most of its projects use 1/8\\" (3 mm)-wide strips, but the one I wanted to try right away, \\"A Blue Cornflower and Daisy Arrangement\\" involved cut-out and fringed petals, plus a fringed center using ¼\\" (6 mm)-wide strips.  A fringing tool would be very useful for many of this book's projects, if you don't want the tedium of fringing strips by hand.<br /><br />The patterns in this guide vary from 60% of actual size to full-size.  (I wish authors would stick to full-size patterns, but I suppose this isn't always possible).  They range from simple to complex, but even the complex designs consist of a few varieties of paper coils, repeated many times.  Most of the projects involve flowers and/or butterflies, but there are also a few Christmas designs and a pair of Easter bunnies.  The finished quillwork is used to decorate picture frames, plaques, boxes, greeting cards, and gift bags (sachets).<br /><br />Colored photographs decorate this 128-page craft book, including a gallery of paper quilling art by Claire Sun-ok Choi in its final pages.  I am especially fond of her fanciful, multi-colored butterflies.  This author has also published \\"[[ASIN:1592530362 Designing Handcrafted Cards: Step-by-Step Techniques for Crafting 60 Beautiful Cards]]\\" (2004).

B001R10BM8|2.0|So it's a non-canon movie....it was my 2nd favorite, behind Goldfinger.  To heck with the purists.  It has Sean Connery.<br /><br />My comments are focused on the lousy video quality for a blu-ray movie.  It's really no better than my standard DVD copy.  The master copy must be somewhat lousy, or the technician was an amateur.  I swear I could have done a better job myself at creating the conversion.  If I'd known that---I wouldn't have spent my $23.95 on this copy.<br /><br />But at least this one doesn't suffer the Samsung BD-P1200 no-play bug.

B001MYIXAW|3.0|I consider myself open-minded when it comes to viewing movies of different genres; I do like all kinds of movies.   When I read the review of this movie on [...] which gave it a rating of 97%, I was excited about watching it.  BUT, when it finally came to it, I have to say I can't think of a more boring and slow paced movie that I have seen in the last ten or so years than this one.  The pacing was extremely slow (worse than Peter Jackson's King Kong) and  the acting was average at best.  The way in which the bullies and the main character were portrayed, in my opinion, were simply not believable.  However, I thought the girl who played the vampire was the star of the show.  The overall story was okay for a vampire flick, but I'm just still puzzled how it was so critically acclaimed as it was.  In conclusion, I still would say it is worth the one watch, but you're better off renting it and saving yourself the twenty bucks from buying the DVD.

0670020478|4.0|The subtitle of Ken Robinson's new book is How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything.  Robinson writes about In The Zone moments where time flies by and you are totally absorbed.  As identifying these moments is what I ask of my own coaching clients. I obviously buy into Robinson's theory that you will most likely thrive in what you enjoy doing.  An added bonus are the numerous, inspirational examples of people in their \\"Element\\".    The book has chapters for key questions such as:    Finding a community support system -- Robinson refers to this as your \\"tribe\\"    Dealing with family and friends who might not be supportive    Finding mentors    Identifying your passion later in life    Handling money issues when your passion might not pay    While Robinson writes about life and vocation in general, all of these issues are critical for the job search as well.  You need a support system -- a job search group, a coach.  You need to guard against people giving bad advice or discouraging you -- I advise my clients to limit their media consumption and to not listen to family and friends who may have out of date advice.  You need outside help -- that's why networking is so important.  You need to recognize that it's never too late -- even if your job search has stalled or you procrastinated and didn't start as early as you should, you can still start anew with a better, more productive search from this day on.  You need to consider and decide on the money issues -- you have to support yourself and as Robinson notes, you don't necessarily have to do that with your burning passion nor do you have to give up your passion to support yourself.    It's always nice to hear how other people achieve success -- in the case of Robinson's book, the success of doing what they love.  It provides encouragement when the day-to-day job search may get you down.  Stop reading the unemployment statistics and the dismal stock market news, and surround yourself with positive words of encouragement, such as the wonderful stories and advice shared in \\"The Element\\".
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|THE FALL is one of the more stunningly beautiful cinematic works to be created in recent years.  Vibrant young director Tarsem Singh, born in India and trained at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, CA, produced, directed and wrote (with Dan Gilroy, Nico Soultanakis, and Valery Petrov) this magical tale that blends fantasy, illusion, dreams, and altered reality with one of the more touching stories imaginable.  The film takes many risks and for this viewer they all work.  With only one other film ('The Cell') in his bag, this splendid work signals the arrival of a new Dali/Fellini/Bunuel figure in cinema.<br /><br />The setting is a hospital in Los Angeles sometime in the 1920s where a little immigrant girl Alexandria (the amazing Romanian child actress Catinca Untaru)  is recovering from a broken arm.  She waders the hospital looking for something to help her while away the hours and comes upon a kind patient Roy Walker (Lee Pace) who has been through numerous operations and is addicted to morphine.  The two form a friendship through Roy's willingness to weave stories for Alexandria (much in the same vein as Scheherazade) and in Roy's stories the various patients and personnel of the hospital take on fantasy roles: there are five men (including Roy as the Blue Bandit) who are attempting to kill Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone) - Darwin (Leo Bill), the Mystic (Julian Bleach), Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley)  and other fascinating characters.  How the stories intertwine with Roy and Alexandria as friends and as victim of morphine abuse and supplier of the drug makes for a complex, multifaceted adventure that takes place in beautiful, strange locales throughout the world.  How the relationship between Roy and Alexandria develops amidst all the surreal tales is the focus of the  film.<br /><br />The cinematography (Colin Wilkinson), costumes (Eiko Ishioka)  and musical score (Krishna Levy) enhance the beauty of the film, as does the transition into the creation of silent movies that opens and closes the film. There is more in this little film than one viewing could ever completely reveal. Visit it once and become as addicted to the magic as was the king to Scheherazade's endless tales.

0618918248|4.0|Dawkins presents many very well thought out arguments. Some of his conceptual ideas are quite complex, while using analogies he builds his thoughts more visually for the reader.  Dawkins use of subtle (and not so subtle) humor at times is wonderful.    I believe anyone who likes to think should read this book. Most believers will reject this book due to it's complexity of thought, something religious belief allows us to easily escape and avoid.
0805079831|3.0|There are enough reviews posted that explain what the book is about that I will spare the reader the duplication.  My bottom line is: this book is well researched, well written, well documented and well targeted.  But I find the author lacking in perspective and too overtly political for my taste.<br /><br />As I read the book I began to think of Klein as the \\"George Bush of the left\\".  The two seem to share a dualistic belief that there are two choices in running economies: Chicago School capitalism and socialism. The book is clearly targeted to fans of the latter not the former.  Much of the logic is typical of one with a political agenda.  For example, since Pinochet was really bad, Allende must have been good.  Want proof? Why under Allende, inflation (barely) stayed under 200%, under Pinochet it was twice that!  Clearly 200% inflation would prompt lots of people to sign up for a coup, and I cannot think of many people who brought on that kind of inflation who are revered by history.  But Klein's conclusion is that because the Chicago boys doubled inflation and Pinochet was a despot AND there are only two choices, therefore, Allende must have been good.<br /><br />I said above that the book is well targeted.  It is clearly intended for a left of center audience.  People like my step daughter who gave the book to me LOVE it.  If you are left of center and like \\"preaching to the choir\\", you may enjoy it (Klein's writing is excellent).  But I am not that audience (I am a pragmatic moderate), so I never really connected to it.  I learned quite a bit from it (it seems to be well researched) but could never get past the logical similarity to a negative political campaign.  It is hard to say if Klein is intentionally taking this path or simply lacking the perspective needed to find another. I suspect it is the latter.

B001PNVYMO|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys came to success in the 1980s through musics that combined techno, disco and intelligent lyrics that moved between love, melancholy and second degree humor. The late 90s and early 2000s marked bold and upbeat albums like Very, Bilingual and Nightlife. All great titles with unforgettable songs like Se a vida e.     Then during this decade, the Boys went into a combination of remix albums, Disco 4 (this one was decent) and Fundamental. I think Fundamental was Chris and Neil thinking \\"let's do something new and innovative\\" and it was. But while alright, they were also forgettable songs and a departure from what people know them for.     Yes is the return of the Pet Shop Boys to their upbeat and unique style.  The extra songs are OK, but it's really the core album that has all the \\"meat\\" in it. All in all, 5 stars. If you like the band, you need this one.
B00127RAJY|4.0|*Update 11/18/09  - So far I lost 7 lbs. with this DVD and cross-training with dance, pilates, and biking. I never did this for 30 consecutive days since I am already active and had 'special' days when jumping up and down proved problematic. I will leave this on rotation until next week when I'll need to shake things up for Thanksgiving! Good luck to everyone during the cold months ahead - we can do it!<br /><br />  I received my DVD yesterday and usually hold back comments for at least a month. I workout on a really basis but I still have a few extra pounds to burn. I like the no non-sense attitude of Jillian when I'm trying to squeeze in a quick workout before my other duties in the morning. As a dancer, there are times when I like frilly but not so-much when I'm strength training. Back to the DVD...<br /><br />  From all the other reviews you know that the exercises are basic. The key is that you are concentrating on your form and 'lingering' for a couple seconds with each move. By the end of the 1st segment which includes bicycle abs in slow motion, I was screaming 'Uncle!' But Jillian motivates you to 'keep at it and that we're not going to get body results for free.' Hearing that inspired me to realize that my burning quads would be just fine later, and they are! I'm in no pain today so I'm ready for round two! No breaks - the title says '30 Days!'<br /><br />  As Dixie J. commented a few hours ago, nutrition information is not provided in this DVD. There is a website listed for a free starter kit but as Dixie said, you have to order that online for a trial period. I rated the DVD 4 stars (which is still great) because it states on the cover that you can 'lose up to 20 pounds in 30 days' which must be done with proper nutrition. Tamilee Webb provides nutrition information in her DVD menu or in a booklet that comes with the DVD. Why didn't '30 Day Shred' provide that from the start? We already bought the DVD.<br /><br />  A few math items - there are 3500 calories in a pound. Depending on level of intensity, the average person may burn 8 calories per minute. If that applies to this workout alone that lasts for about 22 minutes, that's burning an average of 176 calories total (again depending on weight and intensity level).<br /><br />  Those weighing more can burn more calories per minute which is why it is sometimes so difficult to lose those last few nagging pounds, especially if the workouts plateau. Back to the long-winded math which I'll direct at myself since I said I would do this for 30 days and report back to everyone. If I burn an average of 180 calories per '30 Day Shred' workout, working out for 30 straight days to this would burn about 5400 calories (or using the 3500 calories per pound formula, not quite 2 pounds).<br />  That's why nutrition information is so important too. Exercise is necessary, but what and how much we eat is even more important. Burning fat also means not providing too much fat in the first place. It was a hard decision to make, but I feel so much better eating a proper diet even though I still have to have a piece of pure chocolate every now and then.<br /><br />  With today's economy, I'm glad that there are state health/weight loss programs (even competitions) you can track online and Dr. Ian from the 50 million pound challenge that offer FREE tools for tracking your progress and gives FREE meal plans and shopping lists for those foods. Check with your state to see what's offered or google Dr. Ian Smith.<br /><br />  As a previous winner of a state-wide weight loss competition, I suggest that everyone take a good inventory of their refrigerators and pantries. Decide, like me, what's more important - your overall health or that 'high fructose corn syrup?'<br /><br />  This has been my longest review ever, but obviously overall health is very important to me.  I'll write back in 30 days and record what happened. I'm sure someone else already did that, but we're all are trying to get there together and should contribute. See ya in 30!

It's cheaper, it's lesser quality, but it has an extra 15 minutes of \\"Diaries\\" that the HD version does not carry (though the extras were reportedly filmed in HD) and also two extra episodes, also not included in the HD version.    For the second star down: The case itself came broken. I have asked Amazon for a replacement blu-ray case which they claim will be sent to me, but here three weeks or more on I've no sign of the replacement case, and no idea if the \\"double dvd case\\" the said would be sent will actually turn out to be a blu-ray case that will both hold the discs, and successfully fit in the outer box. If not, I will me much less than satisfied.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I ordered Horton Hears a Who a week before I needed it.  I was concerned it wouldn't arrive by March 2 for a Dr. Seuss birthday celebration with my fourth grade students and their first grade partners.  To my delight Sandy and Chuck's Books got the DVD sent and it arrived in plenty of time for us to watch at our celebration.  It is in perfect condition and we thoroughly enjoyed watching it together.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|My wife and I watched this last night not expecting anything and loved it. Not a normal Woody Allen film, but a great rental at the least. I don't see how anybody could not enjoy this at home on the couch with a glass of wine.
B000002UJQ|1.0|I was very dissappointed when I bought this album.For some reason this albums makes it on top 100 lists of best albums of all time.This is the worst album I have ever bought or heard.The only thing that it is good for is putting you to sleep.Don't ever try and drive a car while listening to this.I liked Radioheads pablo honey album.If you are expecting this to be a good album don't believe the hype.I tryed listening to the album one more time just the other night.It is just awfull, again I fell asleep listening to it.I don't recommend this album at all unless you are having trouble sleeping.Try pablo honey that album is much better.I won't buy a Radiohead album again.
0930289234|5.0|This is the best and most celebrated graphic novel of all time.  Now after reading it I can see why.  This was the best graphic novel I have read to date.  If you have not read it, BUY IT!
B001EP8EL2|4.0|Don't be fooled by the horrible looking stock footage of something falling from the sky that starts the film. Immediately after that scene, the film takes off in breathtaking, stunning clarity. I didn't imagine that a film from 1976 could look so much better on Blu-ray, but it does.<br /><br />The extras are done well too, but as much should be expected for a Criterion release.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|I loved this documentary.  The viewer is caught up in the dedication of this young man who decided he HAD TO do this amazing thing.  He is unbelievably talented and so strong in his belief that the twin towers were put up for him to make this walk.  It's takes a little time to get used to the back and forth between present days and planning days, but the end result is just wonderful.  Great accomplishment and it will NEVER happen again!
B001V9LRTM|5.0|I've always been fascinated with my parents generation and when they showed me this movie (i was probably around 8 or 9 years old) I immediately fell in love with it. It's been one of my favorite movies ever since. I've seen it so many times and there's so much I could say about it; I could go on for ages. If you are a fan of music: EXCELLENT performances by musical legends throughout. If you are a fan of documentaries: this one is extremely well done on all counts - from the performers on stage to the audience to the townies to the various (and many) people who made this event possible...right on down to the in-depth look at the port-o-san facilities - this movie is sheer entertainment through and through. And how beautifully it was executed.     As far as bringing in the musicians: I agree that things should be authentic. But it would be nice to hear it the way it was intended. That being said: I hope to hear the original version AS WELL AS the new version if possible. I pray that they don't mess with \\"soul sacrifice\\" though b/c it is just about my favorite part of the movie and i love it as is. Did they do this with other artists in the film as well or just Santana?    I would like to know more about what is offered on this DVD (commentary, extras, previously unseen performances and whether those will actually be integrated into the film [i hope not] or included as extras, etc...) as well as with the collectors edition set as a whole (the pictures that are up are giving me an idea....but i want to know more!). I've pre-ordered it already b/c i love it that much and it doesn't really matter in the long run...but i'm so excited I want to know more! - if anyone has any info about this stuff please post.    Other than that, enjoy this absolute gem of modern american culture! :-)

B00151A6TI|5.0|This was one of the best albums of 2008, and a great followup to Sleeping In Traffic: Part One. Yes, it could be easy to dismiss these guys as Zappa imitators - but their music has other aspects.     I guess if you don't like some humor in your music now and then, Beardfish isn't for you. But it's not like it's an idea that's been beaten to death or something, it feels very original. There are some really beautiful musical sections going on in this album. The instrumentation seems much tighter than on Part One, with better production. I love the warm organ sounds and the very audible bass performance.     Somebody said they listened to about 10 minutes of this album before throwing it out - a shame, although I'm not sure I'm convinced. The first track is a very pleasant sounding instrumental. The second track has some awesome keyboard work and there's no trace of humor in the lyrics - although the solo section is a little wonky, I find it interesting. The third track is probably the highlight of the album for me, and once again, does not contain much humor. It's more of a dark sarcasm at this point. So there you go, we're nearly 15 minutes into the album and all you have experienced is very high quality progressive music that I think anybody can enjoy.    Track four, South of the Border, is where the humor sets in. It's a pretty heavy rocking track with lyrics that will probably get a chuckle or two out of you if you understand that these guys are just having some fun. This is followed by some quirky instrumentals that I find entertaining.    Now we get to the title track, a whopping 35 minute epic. I found this track to be a great musical adventure and to be honest I don't see how any prog fan wouldn't find at least something to like here - definitely enough to keep them from chucking the album out of their window. I just can't comprehend that.    Anyways, these guys are one of the best prog acts around today, along with The Flower Kings, Echolyn, and Spock's Beard. Their Sleeping In Traffic albums have landed them a spot touring the United States with Dream Theater, Pain of Salvation, and Zappa Plays Zappa - a huge accomplishment for a little band from Sweden with only a handful of albums under their belt.
0802130208|1.0|this is not a good read/story. i'm sorry but i simply don't comprehend how others thought highly of it. story about a loser who thinks he's above evryone else just doesn't appeal to me. i stuck through the end of the book to see if there's going to be a twist or some poetic justification of what the loser has done / did not do, but it never came.
B0001I562I|4.0|There was a boy who was very good at a particular electronic game.  Some one recruiets him, to defend the universe, in a setting that duplicates his game.  He, then, faces incredible odds.  That is the plot.    The story is for pre-adolescent boys and does not work as well for older teenagers.  However, the movie is well done and is entertaining, even for old-time SF people.  All the actors do good jobs.  The special effects are OK, but there is room for improvement.  The plot is uncomplicated and not sophisticated.  However, the movie is good for one afternoon of \\"G\\"-rated entertainment.  Some adults may get restless, as this is good, juvenile, entertainment.
B001FB55MG|1.0|I just saw it tonight at a local dollar theater.  It was awful, painful to sit through.  And I actually like Adam Sandler in other movies such as Don't Mess with the Zohan.
B0000029DD|5.0|What else needs to be said about Jeff Buckley's recording of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\"?  Compelling lyrics, dramatic melody, outstanding vocal.  That territory has been covered.  But last year, an American Idol contestant sang it, and the Earth moved.  All of a sudden, everyone remembered, or discovered, who Jeff Buckley was.  But what about the rest of the album?  I wasn't sure, but I got a clue when, this year, Adam Lambert's riveting Idol performance of \\"Ring Of Fire\\" was described as how Jeff Buckley would have done it.  That was enough for me, so I bought the album.<br /><br />Where to start?  Buckley's vocals on this 10-track album range from ethereal and fragile to hard rock, roaming unfettered up and down the scale, all over the place, in every style.  The music backing the vocals is just as varied.  But more than that, there is the range of emotion expressed.  On \\"Mojo Pin\\", in a delicate, nearly feminine voice, Jeff is in despair:  \\"...if only you'd come back to me...\\", he sings, backed by music with, first, a jazz flavor, then, Led Zeppelin rock.  The title song has a more straightforward folk-rock feel, and the vocal ends by being raw and intense.  \\"Last Goodbye\\" is another song about a dying relationship, with a touch of an East Indian influence;  and you can hear this more strongly in \\"Dream Brother\\" - trance-inducing guitar, droning melody.  \\"Lilac Wine\\" is a soft, uncomplicated track paradoxically about confusion and uncertainty.  With \\"So Real\\", we are back to jazz, loaded with chord, tempo and genre changes;  and I get the impression that the experience described might have been a little TOO real.  \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\" is a slow, steady folk/blues track, and, as the title suggests, the singer is longing for his lover to appear.  On \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\", Jeff sounds like a member of the Vienna Boys' Choir as he sings an acoustic-backed, hymn-like song.  In a complete reversal, \\"Eternal Life\\", despite the title, has killer grunge-rock music with hard-edged lyrics and very earthy delivery.<br /><br />So, why does this album remain so fascinating 15 years after its release, 12 years after Jeff's untimely death?  Besides the obvious talent, his fixation on romantic love - the driving force of the album - makes him a very alluring figure.  This, coupled with the dreamlike atmosphere of the tracks, gives him an elusive quality.  You want to grasp who and what he is, but you can't, not really.  Who knew that such a debut would also be the finale?  What could this young man have accomplished if he had lived longer?  Sudden tragic deaths, like Jeff's and that of actress Natasha Richardson last week, leave me with an uneasy feeling, a feeling that there is unfinished business.  Well, maybe in the next life?with hard-edged lyrics and very earthy delivery.    So, why does this album remain so fascinating 15 years after its release, 12 years after Jeff's untimely death?

B0000UJDLM|4.0|I enjoyed watching \\"Short Circuit\\", but I doubt if it is for everyone.  Because of the premise that this is about an 'escaped' combat robot and because of some disturbingly milartaristic moments and questionable language, I doubt if anyone under age 17 should watch this thing.  It is a decent comedy film with a science fiction based plot, but ...  Also, one of the main characters is an asian Indian, who is stereotypical in many ways.  Unfortunately, he is one of the focal points of the comedy, which does have some racial ignorance.    I admit to sitting through it and enjoying the movie.  Also, I am giving it a good rating.  But ...  (Please do notice that those 'but's do add up to a sort of question mark.)  Do prescreen this movie for children under 17.  However, I think college age kids will enjoy this movie.  Older SF fans will, also, enjoy this movie.

B001Y4AZ4W|5.0|I really liked this episode - They're moving the story forward and creating a great and entertaining episode at the same time.  I liked the way Clark even changed to the blue red blur in a phone booth once on this one.  Most of the younger viewers may not have caught that one cause they might not know that in the Superman comics often had him changing in a phone booth.  Writers - keep it up - and don't even think about letting Clark get killed by Doomsday as happened in the stupid comic series in the '90's.
B00133KFGW|5.0|August Rush is a delightful movie.  With fantastical qualities, this heartwarming story gets the viewer emotionally involved through its amazing and dynamic music.  With an open mind, this story will touch you in a way most movies cannot.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|Sunshine from Oscar winning director Danny Boyle is just riveting! What's there not to like about this pic? The acting is solid, the cinematography is out of this world, and the score and sound of this blu ray are showcase material. Easily a must own for fans of the film.<br />This is a film that requires multiple viewings. The story is of a group of astronauts that are trying to blow up the sun to save the planet. They are not the first ones to attempt such a feat however. I like this film more every time I watch it. Emotional and hypnotic, this is truly a film to check into!

B000002J1I|3.0|As if to answer the question \\"what the hell was Yes doing in 1978?\\" along comes Tormato. The splattered tomatoes on the front and back cover are perhaps an indication of how the record company felt about the recording. 'Arriving UFO' may have inspired UFO/comet death cults. 'Circus Of Heaven' is particularly cringeful as it features an overly-dramatic reading by Jon Anderson's son.    But it's not all bad. 'Future Times/Rejoice' is an anthemic starting track. 'Onward' is a classic track and should be included on any Greatest Hits compilation. The closing 'On the Silent Wings of Freedom' is also very good. There are 10 bonus tracks (more than doubling the original 8).    Yes had a string of bad albums in the late 1970's and early 1980's. But, 90125 and Big Generator eventually redeemed them.    [DW]
1577312082|3.0|I understand and appreciate the author's message. He speaks very clearly and it all makes sense, however, this 7 disc audio CD could have been cut down to 4 CD's if he would not repeat himself so much. I completely understand the need to reiterate certain points, but he repeats himself word for word numerous times throughout the book to the point you feel like you messed up the order of the CD's or that you forgot to change it. Very annoying!
B00003000M|5.0|This album is a must-have for Marley lovers.  The artists who worked together to create this did an excellent job of breathing new life and creativity onto the Bob Marley tracks.  The arrangements/remixes are unique and refreshing and show that the artists have a true appreciation for Bob's music and were musically inspired by him to create something new.  As a musician myself, I too have found the same incredible creative inspiration from Bob's music, so I relate to this album whole-heartedly.  I love that they used the original tracks of his voice and mixed in the new ideas.  I also love that each track starts with a spoken word snippet by or about Bob that puts the context of his life and mission into the music.  Heart-warming...Absolutely beautiful...One love!
B000002GKT|3.0|I had this album years ago  and played it into destruction!  It was a good live sounding album.    The CD sound is as limp as it can get. I have made better sounding CD's on my Linux computer than this.  Whoever mastered this CD needs to change jobs, I'm even considering re-mastering my copy it's that poor.    So buy it for the bands sake and play it on something cheap and cheerful.    Cheers  Frank
B001ACH4DS|4.0|Couldn't wait to get David Cook's album.  Some fantastic songs (I like \\"Lie\\" and \\"Time of my Life\\" the best but I felt the music was way too loud and covered Cook's voice.  He can produce strong vocals but in quite a few of the songs, the music/vocal mix was tipped in the favor of the musicians.  It's a shame...
B0018BF1J0|5.0|What makes the 35-plus year solo career of Lou Reed so brilliant - yet frustrating - is his ever-changing delivery of music for his touching, haunting and poetic lyrics; he is like a hard throwing pitcher who will toss a few knuckleballs just because he can, not due to any strategy to get a batter out.<br /><br />The studio albums are from 1972-1976 and includes the classic Transformer (1972) - highlighted by Satellite of Love, Walk on the Wild Side and the driving guitar riff on Vicious - and the misunderstood conceptual masterpiece, Berlin (1973). The debut solo effort - Lou Reed (1972) - mostly contains Velvet Underground outtakes, while funk dominates the mix in Sally Can't Dance (1975). Reed takes a softer approach on Coney Island Baby (1976), which is one of his strongest efforts in crafting lyrics for an entire album.<br /><br />Each disc comes in a mini-LP sleeve and the ongoing series from Sony BMG Music Entertainment is imported from Germany. It is a nice collectible for fans, with the Reed set a solid gaze into his sound and vision.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|This is the best concert of ANY musician I have ever seen!  It grabs you from the first note and does not let you go until the last.  This is one concert you will never forget.

0385339682|4.0|I listened to the Last Juror a few months ago.  I loved the characters, the descriptions, the southern way of life and how Grisham captured it so vividly.  I found myself wanting to have some of Mrs. Callie's meals and having conversations with her.  I loved Willie Traynor's character as well as all the characters that he interacted with.  One of my favorite reads in a long time!
0066620996|5.0|After reading this book I feel like it important to address why some people give it 1 out of five stars. I do not think Jim Collins meant to invent any new and crazy ideas with this book rather than shedding light on what we already know but somehow forget to implement in our daily business lives. I find it fascinating that Circuit City and Fannie Mae were once great companies and believe that their failure only strengthens Jim Collin's thesis. Just because a business was great last year doesn't mean it will continue to be great. Great business practices require constant attention and I feel that this book's principles makes it clear why those businesses failed in the end even though at the time of publication they were at the top of their game. All in all, I think the book is well written, a quick read, slightly overpriced, and completely worth your time. Go to the library, pick it up, read it over a week or weekend, and put all the concepts in the back of your head because the worst thing that can happen to you is a paper cut when you turn one of the pages.
B001FBSMF8|2.0|When I think of classic rock vocalists from my formative years I distinctly and fondly recall Paul Rodgers and Steve Marriott.  When listening to the offerings of modern rock over the last couple decades, to me there is only one voice that stands out and could match Rodgers and Marriott in their heyday.  The person who owns that voice is Chris Cornell.  With Soundgarden and Audioslave, Cornell's voice was gritty and melodic at the same time, and to me it put him in a class of his own.  I am not overly fond of his two previous solo albums, but I did like his contribution to the \\"Great Expectations\\" soundtrack (to me it sounded like a Soundgarden track.    With that being said, Cornell has allowed his vocals to be compromised by the slick production of Timbaland and now leaves his fans in a quandary of sorts: is this a one off experimental synthesizer/canned drum laden pseudo hip hop album; is this an example of Cornell being at a crossroads as to where his musical career should go; or will he return to what he does best on his next album (with a new group or solo)?    If the album cover is any indication, then fans might infer that we have lost the rocker Chris Cornell to the slickly produced experimental/hip hop driven Cornell: the front of the album cover shows Cornell poised high in the air with his guitar raised above him; the back cover shows the guitar broken into many pieces.  To me, these two photos tell it all.  He symbolically destroyed the symbol of rock that (along with his vocals) scored him legions of fans and has left all that behind to (ostensibly) reach a new audience.  One can only home that he one day returns to what he does best--produce ballsy, in your face, guitar driven screaming rock and roll. Come back home, Chris; your fans miss you.
B00007FOMP|5.0|What's Going On is not only Marvin Gaye's masterpiece but its also a very moving album, and is one of the greatest albums ever created. Song topics range from damaged war veterans(What's Happening Brother) to the drug addiction of, \\"Flyin High(In The Freindly Sky)\\", to religion, \\"God Is Love\\", and finally a damaged ecology, \\"Mercy Mercy Me(The Ecology)\\". Each and every song in here contains Marvin Gaye's beatufil singing voice that sounds like it came from his soul. Also on a lot of the songs there are very beautiful string arrangements that makes songs sound like they come from the soul and heart. What's Going On is the essential album for any music lover because its just one of the those albums that really moves you. All in all if you dont own What's Going On I'd advise you to pick up a copy today if you want to hear an album that will change your life.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Another light-hearted investigative drama along the lines of Bones or The Closer. Good ensemble cast. Main character w a special talent. And an emotional back story that gives the series lots of heart.
0765316897|5.0|This trilogy was a delight to read.     Each book was between 500 and 650 pages long, which meant I didnt have to worry about breezing through it in a couple of hours. There was rarely a dull moment, and all the questions are answered in the final volume (Hero of Ages). There's not much more I can add, without giving away any spoilers, but there are 79 other reviews on this book, so there's bound to be a couple which give you the breakdown, if you so wish to find out.    The only question I have left is- if this is how the power's that be are like for this world, does that mean all other planets in their universe also have their own gods?
B001MYIXAW|1.0|What a poor movie i waited for this a long time and was disappointed with the outcome of the movie. i advise no one to buy this movie and waste your money on it.
B00004WF68|5.0|This disk is famous for the great playing and drug influenced music.  \\"Dear Mr Fantasy\\", the title cut, features trippy guitar and Steve Winwood's soaring vocals.  \\"Berkshire Poppies\\" is an obviously a reference to one of the drugs of choice, featuring Winwood's ragtime piano. \\"Dealer\\" and \\"Colored Rain\\" are classic traffic rockers, that showcase the band's ability to mix winds and woodwinds through their music effectively. Dave Mason's \\"Hole In My Shoe\\" is a happier, chemically influenced tune, that shows a lighter side of his writing. In all, it is a period piece, that is different in that the melodies are catchy, and the musicanship great enough to stand the test of time.
0061205699|4.0|This book is one of a kind.   Harpler Lee really showed how life was like in the 30's.   This book potrayed the life themes of innocence, honesty and justice.
1416914307|5.0|I'm so happy with this book.  I really was not expecting it to be as good as it was, and I love the twists in it. I do have to say that some of the book was predictable, but I loved it just the same and was sad to part with this series.
B00005LC1H|5.0|What is so great about FT is how psychologically acute it is. The relation between Basil and Sybil is fantastic. You can see how ten years earlier they both might have seen each other as quite a catch. She, pretty and vivacious. He, tall and from a slightly higher social class They are sort of lower middle class and middle middle class respectively. Unfortunately, they have basically incompatible tastes and interests and the resulting marriage can perhaps best be described as toxic, as they make their own private hell for each other. Totally believable.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|Although the previews & star suggested the film might be worthy of a mature & intelligent audience, it was an old, boring story with some flashy special effects and nothing very new. Aeon Flux no doubt does come or will come from the gaming world & thus, the attraction for youth, but any adult who thought they had discovered quality Sci Fi because someone fast talked Charlize Theron into the star role will be no less disappointed. Game World brought to life with Charlize Theron, end of not-so-hot-old struggle for power, clone story...big deal-not.

B001N26GFM|4.0|It seems a bit odd to describe this movie as good....but it really is.  I suspected what happened in the movie.  It was interesting to watch war from a childs innocent view.    Definitely worth watching!!!!
B000VDDWDS|3.0|The audio was great and this is well filmed and acted picture but the video quality on the Blu-ray version was disappointing.  Thumbs down on this transfer.  I've seen movies over 20 years old look much better than this one.  Lonesome Dove looks about 3x the resolution.
0783230079|5.0|I saw this movie  years ago and for some reason it popped into my mind.  It's not for rent at the video store, so I was delighted to find it for sale.  It's a sweet, moving story with plenty of laughs and a happy ending!  I recommed this movie for anyone!  Definately appropriate for the entire family!
B001IXSU8M|5.0|This album is kind of an odd duck. On the whole, it's produced a lot more like the European pop-dance music (vocal trance, etc) except it has some really odd instrumentation and song structures. Interesting musically. Reminiscent of electroclash with glam elements in the choruses. Lyrics are beyond dumb and occasionally autotuner is used to mask vocal deficits, but this is typical for the genre, since it's about the beats.    Oh, and boy will it get you moving. Real high energy stuff. Great for a workout or the morning drive to work. Every song is good. Nearly every track sounds like it could be a single. A very solid album.    Highly recommended for dance, glam, and electro fans. Most everyone else with a moderately open mind to dance or pop should like it too.    If you like this album, you should probably check out the Veronicas new album too. Another great electro/dance/pop album with rock song structures.
B001HN697M|4.0|For all the fans that love Underworld and Vampires this will be an enjoyable movie.  If you are a stickler on the little tings like me you will find some inconsistantcies in this movie and the flashbacks/stories told in the first two. They should not have used Kate Beckinsale as Victor's daughter. She could have been in the movie but she looked nothing like Victor's duaghter from the clips in the other movie. Also the flashbacks about the capturing of William in the woods from the first movie was different from the tale told in this the latest installment.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|First time I have listened to her, love her voice and the different kind of music she sings. I am a country or rock and roll gal but this is a very nice change of pace.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Jimmy Page and Robert Plant were sitting in this audience for this display of sheer musicianship. Jeff shows the worlds once again that he is truly his own man when it comes to playing guitar. No one sounds like him.
B001LV5OOY|4.0|Let me start off by saying this is a fantastic album. I was walking about Best Buy one day and with no intention of buying anything and the album cover to this album caught my attention. On the album was a sticker that said \\"UK #1 Album\\" so I gave it a whirl and purchased knowing the talent that has come from over seas is usually nothing that is horrible. I popped it in, and thought to myself, \\"This is pretty catchy, but works,\\" It is a great album all round though, it is definately a cd you could pop in and not skip a track and totally be entertained the whole way through. As far as the album of the year goes, it sounds like a modern day Depeche Mode mixed with Interpol and Coldplay. When I listen to it I just feel like I have heard it before. If you are a big fan of either of the three bands I stated above, you will love this album for sure, as I do. But its only the end of March, there is still alot of great albums set to be released this year, we shouldnt jump the gun.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|What an entertaining tale! I found myself laughing at \\"Amanda\\", burning with embarrassment for her at times, and being completely GREEN with envy because she was doing what *I* have always wanted to do, ever since I first read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" -- BE Elizabeth Bennett.<br />Mr. Cowan's performance as Mr. Darcy puts Mr. Firth's slightly wooden version to shame.  He has an exquisitely mobile face and piercing eyes, utilizing both to perfection when giving us a Mr. Darcy who is mannerly and elegant (that \\"aristocratic languor\\" Amanda speaks of) but inwardly passionate.  Sublime performance.  Very enjoyable and completely believable.<br />WELL worth the watch, more than once.  (Thank you, DVR. lol) Heartily recommended.
B000002L9W|5.0|Eat 'em & Smile showed that Dave could keep the VH style & sound and build upon it.  Even some of the requisite VH-isms are there, like the cover tunes (That's Life and Tobacco Road).  But Dave went out and got the VERY BEST PLAYERS available, which is what puts this disc at the top of the solo Dave stuff.  So many 80's bands had great guitarists, but how many also had a master rock bassist, too?  Billy is amazing.  He & Vai work so well together, weaving their parts together in small bits & pieces that may go by unnoticed by some, but the musicians in the audience certainly get it.<br /><br />This disc has some amazing songs (leadoff track \\"Yankee rose\\" and \\"Shyboy,\\" just to name a few.  The only negative about this disc is it's so annoyingly short.  I think it clocks in at under 40 minutes.  Kind of a bummer when so many discs now go 60 minutes +.  Oh well, it's a great debut despite its brevity.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I bought this movie to show to my freshman science classes during the down time during final exams because I's heard the good reviews and knew that I didn't have to worry about crude language, sexual situations, etc. To my surprise, I really enjoyed this tale of post-environmental disaster. The kids (many of whom are very poor and didn't see Wall-e in theatres)really got into it as well, both as entertainment and as a cautionary environmental/societal parable.
B001MYIXAC|1.0|As a fan of vampire movies I wanted to like this movie; I had heard great things about it.  I was certainly disappointed.  While the story was interesting, and the acting well done (as long as odd and disaffected was what they were going for), the pacing drug (two hours felt like four), and the overall feel made me wonder why Sweden doesn't have a 99% suicide rate.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|Let's not kid ourselves - just give the Best Actor Oscar to Mickey Rourke right now, because there is no competition. This is the role of a lifetime for him, and he plays it to perfection. And luckily, the rest of the movie and cast holds up as well, making this one of the best of 2008. Oh, and the fact that Marisa Tomei gets naked? That's just a bonus on a movie that already rates 5 stars!!
1401203078|2.0|There's precious little story here.  Our pals from the previous outings, Allan Quartermain and Mina Harkness, are on the run from MI6, and along the way they find lots of time to read \\"The Black Dossier\\" which is MI6's dossier on The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in all its varied forms.      Selections from the Dossier include everything from a 'lost' Shakespeare play to a Tijuana bible.  Unfortunately, all of those selections are actually written by Alan Moore, so there's a great sameness to them all.  It's a tough read plowing through all this stuff, and I'm not sure it's at all worth it.      Moore seems to be saying that everything ever written by anyone is actually true, which isn't nearly as much fun as it sounds. Things get more goofy and unrealistic as we go along, until we get treated to a really racially insensitive alternative to Raggedy Ann (I can't even post the name of the character, because it's as inflammatory as the \\"N\\" word in many English-speaking parts of the world).  We all end up in \\"The Blazing World\\" (just call it Misty Magic Land, why don't you), and for extra-special cheesyness, it's all in 3D when you put on your special red and blue paper glasses.    If you absolutely adored the extra stuff that Moore crammed into the last couple of pages of the individual issues of \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" this may be the book for you.    If you're looking for the rip-roaring adventures of the previous two books, wait for Moore's next outing with the \\"League\\".
B001GCUNYO|2.0|Disappointing vigilante film that wastes a great actor like Liam Neeson. I'm sorry, but he just doesn't cut it as an action hero. And in this day of great action movies like the Bourne Trilogy or 'Casino Royale', or even 'Shoot 'Em Up', there's no reason for this film to be as lame as it actually is.
0891419195|5.0|I have read Eugene Sledge's With the Old Breed (WTOB) several times, starting back in the 1980's, and I've found it a rewarding experience each time.  We see the transformation of the mild-mannered nineteen year old as he becomes a well-trained, then a battle-hardened Marine, known by the deceptively tough-sounding nickname of Sledgehammer.  He sees fellow Marines maimed and killed, the ruthlessness of his enemy, who must be answered in kind, and the wearing away of the veneer of civilized life.  Sledge describes in uncommonly vivid detail the degrading conditions he and his comrades must endure for weeks on end as they confront a foe who neither grants nor expects quarter.  Among the many memorable scenes are the nights on Half-Moon Hill on Okinawa, with constant rain falling, and star shells illuminating the corpses in the hellish, devastated landscape.  All of that is certainly memorable stuff, but if that were all there were to WTOB, we would have an excellent memoir, but one better than others only by degree.<br /><br />I find what sets WTOB apart from the rest, however, is the capacity on the author's part for sober and honest self-examination.  Sledge tells us bluntly that as his landing craft approaches Peleliu that he is afraid of losing control of his bladder.  When he sees his first dead Marine up close, he says he is glad the Marine's mother can't see him.  Perhaps the most revealing episode about Sledge is when he is forced to shoot a Japanese soldier at close range, after the Japanese emerges from a bunker and tries to throw a grenade.  As Sledge's first bullet strikes the soldier's chest, Sledge sees the man's face \\"contorted in agony.\\"  Sledge first feels revulsion that he just killed a man at close range, then shame that he feels that way, given the situation and is glad his comrades can not read his thoughts.  That type of self-revelation is rare, and stands in contrast to more swaggering, self-serving memoirs.  It may also explain why Sledge, although he breaks down a few times, sobbing, he never becomes unhinged, and is able to continue under the most appalling conditions during his time in combat.<br /><br />In a recent edition of Military History magazine (Nov/Dec 2008), the writers were polled to each give their top-ten best military history books of all time.  When the results were tallied, the name of Eugene Sledge stood next to those of Clausewitz and Thucydides.  No less a military historian than John Keegan has called WTOB, \\"one of the most arresting documents in war literature.\\"  No higher recommendations are needed.  But before you read WTOB, do yourself a favor and find a Sledge interview on Youtube, and listen to the audio files of his interview at the Studs Terkel website, and browse the Eugene B. Sledge collection at the Auburn University digital library.  Hearing Sledge talk, with his gentle, mellifluous southern accent, and seeing his mild-mannered nature, will give a \\"voice\\" to the narrative of WTOB that will enrich your reading experience.breaks down a few times, sobbing, he never becomes unhinged, and is able to continue under the most appalling conditions during his time in combat.

B001QB9H1K|2.0|Not nearly as good as the previous two movies, which I had really enjoyed. The plot is getting tired, and the action is predictable. The ever-reliable Statham does a good job, but just can't carry the whole movie. And the girl in the movie is so obnoxious that I would have let the bad guys kill her, and walked away with a smile.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|[[ASIN:B0019F02X0 NCIS Naval Criminal Investigative Service - The Fifth Season]] This is one of the best series on tv to date. I have all the seasons and looking forward to season six. I already got four other people hooked on it.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|Wonderous movie that captivated me from the get-go. Which surprised me a bit, since I wasn't overly interested in seeing it, despite the rave reviews. Boy, I was wrong. It's been a long time for me that a 2-1/2 hour movie has gone by so quickly - with so many movies today, I get antsy around the 1-hour mark. Not this one - with it's superb acting and special effects, and especially it's great storytelling, it was like a great book that I couldn't put down
031606792X|5.0|I'm not sure why some readers are using such harsh language to review this book.  After all, this is a fiction story, purpose:  entertaining.  I love surprising, romantic, unthinkable, and happy ending story so if you are too, you will like this book.  If you are thinking too much, breaking down too much, and love dramatic ending, this book is not for you.  Have fun to decide!
B001NFNFNA|3.0|Here's a movie that had potential for greatness, but ended up being just good. The greatness comes from Clint Eastwood as director, along with great cinematography and a strong backing cast. The letdown comes from casting Angelina Jolie in the lead role - while she actual does a decent job, and is better than I expected, her performance still isn't strong enough to carry the film. With a different actress, this could have been in the same league as the great 'Mystic River'. Instead, it's a good, but not great, film.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|I can see why there were folks out there that couldn't handle this movie.  This is not your father's Bond.  I think it's good to change things up once in a while.  I liked the fast paced action of this Bond outing.  Blu-ray PQ was great.  I remember seeing the first Bond movie as a kid and thought the franchise went down the tubes after Connery left.  I'm one of those who think Craig is the best Bond since Connery and look forward to the next Bond movie as long as Craig repeats the role.
B001FB55YE|2.0|The latest from Guy Ritchie, who is now repeating himself. This movie was really good when it was called 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Guns'. And it was even better when it was called 'Snatch'. But now the formula is tired.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|Bond on the run...it sounds like a mid-sixties spy spoof, yet this is the new darker Bond being chased by the good guys as he tries to even the score left  unsettled in [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale [Blu-ray]]].     The secret of the Bond films has always been found in the Bond girls and the  chase. Here the girls take a break while James goes rogue and even M can't bring him in from the cold. But the chase, through parts of the world never seen in the series, offers spectacular action and awe-inspiring scenery.     While the bad guys seek world domination as usual, this time they are cleverly disguised as green entrepreneurs and hailed by friend and foe alike. It is one man (Bond, James Bond) against their evil alliance and for once we feel as if one man, even one as resourceful as Bond may not be enough.    There are moments in the movie which was largely shot in the badlands of Bolivia where we feel Butch and Sundance may emerge to help 007, but in the end no other cultural icons are required. Bond does it all, as he always has.    Blu-ray was meant for movies like this. The action shots are cleverly staged and since in good Blu-ray the action seems to take place on inches away, real and involuntary fright is a frequent reaction.    Danial Craig, now clearly the best Bond in twenty years, refuses to ham it up. He is a man of purpose, a man of action, and a man in the middle, uncomfortably caught between vulnerability and omnipotence. Where the plot sputters Craig commands our attention. and in Quantum of Solace, he desrves it.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|Very cool sci-fi-noir flick from 1998, where humans are the rats in some weird experiment. Hadn't seen this one in quite a while, and was glad to see that it still held up to multiple viewings. And I love the look of this film, which comes across great on Blu-Ray.
0525478183|3.0|In Paper Towns, John Green follows the journey of typical surburban teenager Quentin to find his runaway crush, the popular and enigmatic Margo.  The main interest of the story is in how Green effectively keeps alive the central mystery - Where is Margo?  As we watch Quentin follow the trail of breadcrumbs, we are left to wonder whether this is a game Margo is playing, or something more serious.<br /><br />Quentin is a quintessential \\"everyboy\\" (something that is actually woven into the main theme of the story at a key moment).  The sole perspective of the story is his, and rarely is the reader called to question his narrative.  He is accused of being a coward, but his main flaw would more accurately be said to be acquiescence with the status quo.<br /><br />Meanwhile Margo is \\"the popular girl who is really much more.\\"  Seems a bit of a cliche, but considering Margo is missing for the majority of the book it is somewhat difficult for her to be much more than that.  Her character exists mostly to drive the central theme of the novel that Quentin explores - we should not be satisfied with the fake (paper) world with which we are presented.<br /><br />The other characters in the book are colorful, rightfully painting the paper town with bright pastel and providing humor.  I would not say that any of them are more than two dimensional, but they are welcome foils to the otherwise inward-looking narrator.<br /><br />In sum, paper towns was an well-constructed enjoyable read.  I could see it being satisfying and even emotional for the sort of person who feels trapped in suburban sprawl and is trying to find an conspirator with whom to escape.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|You can call this a vampire movie. But its not like any other one that you've ever seen. Maybe a coming-of-age story. Or even a \\"two lonely outsiders find each other\\" story. It's all of those and more, and it's gonna make my \\"best of\\" list for 2008. This is a haunting, beautiful tale of two 12-year-olds - the boy is a loner who gets beaten up regularly by the school bully. The girl is a vampire who moves in next door. The feel of the movie almost reminds me of Sophia Coppola's 'The Virgin Suicides', with a beatiful melancholy to it. I don't want to hype it up too much, lest you be disappointed, but put this one at the top of your list.
B0018O4YT0|4.0|I saw this in it's orignal version some time back. Didn't really catch on to it, was confused basically. Just watched the directors cut...and now I'm a believer. Second time around I had an idea of what this deal was about..and it made all the difference. I like entering a \\"different world\\" in a film, and this one does a very convincing job. Some magnificent sets, with moody lighting. Good actors, intriguing story. Looking forward to another re-watch in the future.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|I tried watching this several weeks ago, and it just never grabbed me. I'm still not sure why, or what the problem was at the time. I ended up turning it off about 30 minutes in. But after reading many positive reviews, and taking the advice of friends, I gave it another shot - and I'm glad I did. Whatever issues I had the first time around weren't even apparent on my second viewing. I'm still not the biggest fan of Renee Zellweger, but Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen more than make up for that. Essentially this is the story of a friendship, and the \\"western\\" is just the backdrop - it could just as easily be translated to medieval knights or modern cop movie. But with it's nicely understated acting, beautiful cinematography, and minimalist dialogue, it works really well. While this might not be quite up to par with some recent classic westerns ('3:10 to Yuma', 'Open Range', 'Proposition'), it's still quite enjoyable with some memorable moments.
0316174483|5.0|My grandson had this book and loved it. I ordered it for my granddaughter who loves to draw and paint.
B001PA0FF4|3.0|Started out slowly for me, as I felt like I was watching Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep act, rather than feeling like they were the actual characters. But as the movie moved along, I did find myself slowly giving in to the story (and the performances). Amy Adams is adequate in the third lead role, but the movie is almost stolen away by Viola Davis (even though she's only on screen for about 8-10 minutes). The film certainly raises good points that we still grapple with today - personal certainty versus actual proof (ie. Bush administration and WMD's). The biggest misstep in the movie for me comes in the very last scene, which I won't give away, but to me seemed very out of character and weakened the whole movie.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|\\"Final Fantasy VII\\" is one of the most groundbreaking, most popular video games of all time -- the adventures of flawed hero Cloud Strife and his companions, struggling to save a very self-aware planet.<br /><br />Turns out that the battle isn't QUITE over. \\"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\\" picks up a couple years later with new threats to the planet and new silver-haired foes (plus one old one). It's an absolutely stunning piece of work -- though the plot takes awhile to fully sink in, it's awash in beautifully precise, slightly luminous animation, slam-bang action scenes, and some beautifully complex characters,<br /><br />People are falling ill with a mysterious disease called Geostigma. And while Cloud is tooling around in the desert, he's suddenly attacked by a trio of silver-haired youths (Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo) who demand to know where \\"Mother\\" is. Weirdly enough, they also call him \\"brother.\\" Plagued by guilt and geostigma, Cloud isn't terribly interested in finding out about the trio or their connection to Jenova's missing head.<br /><br />But then Loz savagely beats up Tifa in the cathedral, and kidnaps Marlene -- along with all the geostigma-riddled children in Midgar. Unfortunately, Cloud's attempt to get back the kids meets with more failure. And as the brother lay waste to Midgar with materia-generated beasts, Cloud's friends reunite to stop them. And when Kadaj gets his hands on the head, it resurrects an old enemy who may be able to destroy the entire planet...<br /><br />\\"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\\" is one of those movies that takes awhile to sink in, and which (at first glance) seems much more complex than it actually is. It's actually a pretty straightforward tale of a hero overcoming his doubts and trying to save the world. But that story is swathed in a heavy dose of symbolism, and many reflections about how you should live for your friends, not mope about the dead.<br /><br />The writing generally tends toward meditative and slightly poetic (\\"What I want, Cloud, is to sail the darkness of the cosmos with this planet as my vessel...\\"), wit a sprinkling of dry humor (\\"Where can I buy a phone?\\"). And it's crammed with top-notch action scenes -- treetop sword fights, acrobatic motorcycle chases, and a citywide attack from the monstrous Bahamut Sin. The climactic fight is the best: the city is enveloped in a vast cloud of dust and crumbling ruins, as Cloud battles physically and emotionally with his old nemesis Sephiroth.<br /><br />And the animation is a thing of pure beauty. Square Enix outdid themselves with the clarity and vibrancy of the CGI -- luminous flowers and trees, a grey sky, a ruined city, and eerie smoky monsters that rise up and attack. Even the tiny details -- like the texture of Kadaj's leather coat -- are rendered in beautiful detail.<br /><br />Cloud is a likable tortured hero, who works up from despair to quiet strength -- partly from his friends needing him, and partly from Aerith's occasional admonitions from beyond the grave (\\"I think... I want to be forgiven... More than anything...\\"). Most of his friends are cameos in the fight against Bahamut Sin, but the strong-willed Tifa and the mysterious Vincent take strong stands in dragging Cloud back to real life.<br /><br />But the best characterization is in Kadaj and his brothers -- they have the minds of small children, but the knowledge and bodies of grown men. And to their minds, everything they do is perfectly reasonable. They want their mommy, dangit!<br /><br />\\"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\\" takes a little while to warm up, but the exquisite animation, good writing and likable heroes keep it moving.poetic (\\"What I want, Cloud, is to sail the darkness of the cosmos with this planet as my vessel...\\"), wit a sprinkling of dry humor (\\"Where can I buy a phone?\\").

B000VBJEFK|5.0|Pixar does it again: they created both a great story accompanied by fabulous animation. I actually had to watch it twice, since I kept pausing the movie to go \\"ooooh!\\" at the beautiful pictures the first time through.    This is one of those movies that HD was made for.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|Quantum of Solace for me was a flipped around movie.  We start the film with a car chase and though it looked quite exciting, if you were not familiar with Casino Royale, it would make little sense.  Solace is a sequel and if you have not seen Casino, you won't follow the subtle anger of 007, his thirst for revenge.  We meet another Bond girl -- she is also more than she seems, and wants the blood of a man who brutally killed her family and burned her house when she was a little girl in Haiti.<br /><br />I must say the director of photography really knew his stuff.  The gorgeous Italian vistas, the amazing mountains and deserts of Bolivia, amazing.<br /><br />The script really needed some work.  The connection between M and Bond was not clear.  I'll have to watch it again to really understand their relationship in terms of trust and responsibility.  M says she does not trust him to his face but says something else to another agent.  The big evil organization we never get any closure on.  What happened for example to the Bolivian plot?  What happened with the men and women who apparently were connected to this organization, sitting in the opera house plotting and planning?  These questions are answered somewhat, but not in a clear manner, so they lose a star for this.<br /><br />Rewatch Casino Royale, and then watch this movie immediately after.  Solace does not stand on its own, and I think that's why the negative reviews.<br /><br />The DVD is very \\"plain vanilla\\".  A couple of theatrical trailers, a music video by Alicia Keys and that's about it.  Ho humm.<br /><br />Oh, when I said a flipped around movie:  The credits and the famous Bond theme are played at the END of the film, not the beginning.  Interesting but threw me a bit.<br /><br />Rental!  Waiting for a fresh, cleaner Bond in the next film.<br /><br />See:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]]

B000HCPU0Q|4.0|i really didn't need this. i had most of the contents, and i bought a lot of the picture sleeve singles in England. But i got it anyway. It's nice. I guess it would make a good present.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This item would have been almost perfect if it had not been for the food (?) stuck to the back of the case it came in.  I had this sent to my granddaughter as a gift, and the condition of the case was, to say the least, a surprise - not good.  The CD itself was great, and the contact between the Seller and myself was fine.  In the future, he should double-check the item inside and OUT.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|A refreshing corrective to our American fetish with \\"Facing the Giants\\" and winning. As one reviewer insightfully stated: this movie really is about a family of losers who learn the most valuable lesson of all: winning ISN'T everything---it isn't even important. There are no \\"nine steps\\" to success or \\"eight steps\\" to peace with God. God and Life and Families are not systems we program for success, but Blessings we commit to---for better or for worse. We may not defeat the giants, figure out the correct steps to God, or get a new SUV. But life can still be sweet in a dysfuncional VW Van.
B001NE80P4|4.0|C'mon, this is High School Musical 3! Kids loves this kind of stuffs. I didn't think much for it, it's too sugar coated and predictable, with some half decent songs but that won't matter to the kids 7 year-old and up to 14 year-old, mostly girls. They loved it and can't get enough of it.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|A disturbing--but profoundly true---exploration about the nature of human evil: we will willfully distort our memories to create a narration in which we are the victim, rather than the perpetrator, of evil. But we have supressed our memory of having done this! And so we live our lives in noble \\"amnesia.\\" This is why this film is brilliant: because of its reverse chronological narrative we are suckered into our protagonists noble mission. We, too, have \\"forgotten\\" that the narrative we watch (in reverse) has already been distorted. Until the bitter conclusion. Nolan exposes Us!
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Mastodon's last album (Blood Mountain) displayed their nastiest chops ever, but got a bit showoff-ish and self-indulgent. But now Mastodon is dead serious, and Crack the Skye is no laughing matter, lyrically or musically. A convoluted lyrical concept about space travel and czarist Russia is actually a cover for Mastodon's most haunting thoughts ever, inspired by the childhood death of Brann Dailor's sister and the recent severe head injury suffered by Brent Hinds. The band's music is becoming less flashy and more dramatic, played with an epic grandeur that easily becomes bigger than the sum of its parts. The four players have surrendered to the sound, with less hot-dogging and more teamwork. Even the monstrously hyper Dailor on drums has slowed things down a bit, reminding the listener less of a speed demon and more of a coiled snake. The vocals are more in tune with the mood of the music, and this album's lyrics are surprisingly deep and introspective. Mastodon have surely become big-thinking and forward-looking pure musicians.<br /><br />All of the above has given Mastodon the biggest and most compelling sound in modern metal, and this album is sonically imposing and unforgiving from the first note. They even make a banjo sound ominous at the beginning of \\"Divinations.\\" Epic grooves and jarring time shifts add to the success of the rifftastic \\"Quintessence\\" and the especially disturbing \\"Ghost of Karelia.\\" And after dozens of listens I'm still trying to comprehend the two 10+ minute epics \\"The Czar\\" and \\"The Last Baron\\" and I know that these tracks will unveil new musical surprises for months and even years to come. And that's what makes this not just Mastodon's best album yet but also one of the best metal albums in recent memory. It will surely reward repeated listens. Mastodon's huge sounds and huge thoughts have come together in terrifying ways. [~doomsdayer520~]
B00006JQU1|5.0|This is one of those recordings which transforms a work. I had struggled for years to like the Sonatas and Partitas, but a succession of recordings by great violinists had left me feeling thoroughly excluded by them. When I heard Rachel Podger, I suddenly saw the utter delight and involving beauty in the pieces. She loses absolutely none of their intellectual weight, but makes them dance, glow and sparkle. In the great Chaconne from the D minor Partita, for example, I had always previously reached the end feeling rather wrung out and exhausted with the effort of trying to penetrate a difficult and forbidding piece. With Podger's recording I find myself engaged, carried along and very sorry when the final, breath-holding not dies away.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this set too highly - and now that you get both discs for the price of one, it's a serious bargain, too.

B000YDOOUK|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I really like this album, but some of the songs are a bit too short. If they were about a minute of so longer, this would be, in my opinion, an excellent recording. It seems that as soon as you start getting into certain songs, they end too quickly.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria was my reason for watching MTV.  No other representation has ever come so close to my outlook on life.  In fact I was fine tuned and improved by the wit of Daria.  As frightening as that is I am far from alone in my humor, pc incorrectness and yet lofty demand for intelligent thought and expression.  Please put the entire series on DVD once and for all.  You might be surprised just how many of us there are and how successful we have become.  We are a limited group, but we make enough and are loyal enough to Daria to put out the money for the series.<br /><br />Do we have to live in a contrite world that accepts dark events with guilty pleasure; while rejecting the humor, wit and the finger that points right back at us as having a role in the lunacies of life?  Daria takes us to task like no other before or since with an endearing arrogance.

B001PPGAIA|4.0|Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman star in this epic film about Australia during the 30's and 40's.  Kidman travels from England to her husband's property in Australia only to discover that he is dead.  She takes over his cattle operation and, with the help of Hugh Jackman (the Drover) she manages to keep things going despite the best efforts of Carney, a man who has a near-monopoly on the cattle business.  As has been noted, the movie is too long and yes, even corny at times, but I enjoyed the beautiful scenery, the interaction of characters and even some of the corny parts!  I had never thought about the participation of Australia in WW II, but did gain some sense of the history of that time, as well as the racial struggles between the aborigines and white men. Despite its flaws, this is an entertaining movie.

B001NE80P4|5.0|I have to admit I this is the first High School Musical movie I watched before I caught up on the first two, but after seeing the first two (which also were pretty good), I like this one the best of all! The songs are very catchy and the acting by Zac Effron and Vanessa Hudgens (especially on the roof when they were doing a dance) was top of the line. This is almost a classic movie, but a movie the whole family will enjoy. I watched it by myself at the Blue Ridge Cinemas and really liked it. I am thinking of later watching it again on DVD from Blockbuster, Netflix, or Redbox.<br /><br />I am hoping for a High School Musical 4; Freshman College Year next Spring! That will be awesome!
0312944098|5.0|I am new to Jeffrey Archer, having just read his most recent, \\"Paths to Glory\\", which I thoroughly enjoyed.  This novel was even better.    This is \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\" meets \\"The Count of Monte Christo\\" modernized.  Although there are flashes of those classics it is completely fresh and far more than a mere rewrite and modernization.    The story starts with an engagement after which the two lovers meet her brother for a celebratory bottle of champagne.  A fight breaks out after four \\"gentlemen\\" make rude remarks.  One of the gentlemen kills the brother, but the fiance is charged and convicted of murder after a compelling trial.  Thus begins Danny Cartwright's long battle to clear his name and get revenge.    This is classic good against evil with evil having the upper hand in every societal measure - money, education, breeding, etc.    Somehow, Mr. Archer keeps the tension steady and strong through Danny's trial, imprisonment and subsequent travails.  A remarkable achievement for such a long book.  ALthough 500 pages, I was disappointed when the book was done.    Mr. Archer has a clarity of writing that is perfect for his fine story-telling.  There is nothing pretencious about his style.  He sets out to tell the story and he does so in a straight-forward compelling manner.  He never forsakes the plot to show off his talent.    This is a novel that will keep you rooting for the good guy and wishing it would never end.  A darn good yarn.

0812979656|5.0|What a fantastic book! A literary masterpiece that deserved all the critical acclaim bestowed on it. I loved the writing style of Arundhati Roy, with very vivid character portrayal. A must read for anyone interested in reading more than just pop culture books.
0375831002|2.0|As a buyer for a bookstore, I read a lot of YA books. I read the \\"must-read\\" reviews for this book and it sounded right up my alley, deep, meaningful, thought-provoking.   I didn't like it. At all.   So much so that I stopped reading halfway through, something I never do. It simply isn't an engaging read, and I find it very difficult to believe many teens would get past page 3. I suppose I just don't \\"get\\" it, and other people might, so I don't want to call it an awful read. But I found the author's writing style ridiculous and totally un-readable. He seemed to think it sounded poetic, but in the end it often didn't make sense. He says things like:  \\"She nightmared.\\" \\"His face traveled.\\" \\"Her voice planed and curled in her mouth.\\" As i say, it sounds poetic, but it's just not good writing. How does using nightmare as a verb make this sentence richer than \\"she had a nightmare\\"? I don't even know how a face can travel. If he means \\"his expression seemed to wander to thoughts of the past,\\" why doesn't he just say it that way?  Just a few nit-picky examples, but I found the whole book to be written like that. As someone who truly does appreciate fine writing when I see it, it makes me mad that people praise The Book Thief so much. Overall, simply not that interesting. It didn't scream out to me \\"this story needs to be told,\\" like so many other (especially holocaust-era) books do.

B001PPLIEG|2.0|The James Bond movies used to be fantastic adventures, great villains and a good dose of humour, and of course a title song with that John Barry-James Bond feeling (a tradition that was broken with Madonna's awful \\"[[ASIN:B001EDVNLM Die Another Day]]\\" song). That James Bond is now gone, replaced by what feels more like a copy of the overrated Jason Bourne series. Daniel Craig is not bad, but the character has changed. He's now motivated by personal revenge, which isn't bad per se (it was done well in \\"[[ASIN:B000M53GMW Licence To Kill]]\\"), but here it feels tacked on, artificial, irrelevant. His nemesis this time is one Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), possibly the dullest and least charismatic villain in the history of the Bond series. And his evil plot becomes lost in all the scenes of pseudo-emotional personal struggles of Bond and the girl, Camille.    I'm glad I waited for \\"Quantum of Solace\\" (what were they thinking when they picked the title?) to be released on DVD and didn't see it in a theater. There are some decent action scenes but no interesting story to tie it together. I hope for the next movie they will find some good writers and a good director to bring back the James Bond viewers have loved for 45 years. Recommended for fans of the Jason Bourne movies. Bond fans may want to skip this one.
B0017R5UAA|3.0|There are mixed reviews of this CD here and my two cents is it's alright but definitely nothing to write home about.

I don't think this CD will get a lot of listens on my player but it's not bad either.
0312383320|5.0|What I expect from a Stephanie Plum book is a light, funny, fast-moving tale with quirky characters and at least three laugh out loud moments.  I got that in this book.  So many romantic writers strive to be funny and so few amuse me anymore, but so far Evanovich and Stephanie have always delivered a good time.      If you're looking for Classic English Lit stuff, with elapsed time and solid progressive character development, go read a Robert B Parker (whom I also like very much).  If you're looking for a mood lightener and a darn good time, any of the Plum books, including this one, deliver.

If you like dogs, you will probably go for this movie.  I did!  And, by the way, the Blu-Ray quality is superb!
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|Ian Fleming's James Bond 007, the iconic movie super-agent has had many incarnations. In the character's 22nd feature film, is also the first direct sequel to a previous Bond film. \\"QUANTUM OF SOLACE\\" has Marc Forster (Monster's Ball) taking on the director's chair from Martin Campbell (who had directed two other Bond films) and received mixed reactions from critics. After the phenomenal \\"Casino Royale\\", expectations were extremely high and audiences were expecting the same quality as with Daniel Craig's first outing as James Bond. Well, being a sequel, the film follows the same formulas and further develops the groundwork laid out by its predecessor. It would be a real great idea to pick up \\"Casino Royale\\" before you see this film or you may get a little lost.<br /><br />Taking off from the plot of \\"Casino Royale\\", James Bond (Daniel Craig) is on the hunt for the people who ruined his chances at love. Now, if he manages to hook up with beautiful women, catch the bad guys and foil an international plan of eco-blackmail then even better. Even the British secret service is unaware of the dealings of this secret \\"Quantum\\" organization. A greedy so-proclaimed philanthropist, Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) is right at the center of it all. His supposed \\"green\\" organization is racking up barren tracts of land that may or may not be oil rich areas with the aid of shady authority figures and corrupt governments.<br /><br />Daniel Craig reprises his role as the rough, edgy and very tough James Bond. His is not the Bond that we grew up with; suave, smooth-talking, full of finesse made popular by his predecessors to the role. Don't get me wrong, Craig's Bond is very charismatic enough, but his is the type that gets really dirty and has a gritty feel--he lacks the unbelievable high-tech gadgetry which is arguably part of the character's signature repertoire. This Bond is a no-nonsense kind, almost has a take no prisoners mentality driven by the hunger for vengeance due to the loss of his potential love. I rather liked this touch, seeing as we are privy to a Bond almost out of control and seemingly close to the breaking point--more human with emotional attachments much like George Lazenby`s Bond. Now don't think that the film is a simple revenge flick, the film actually has some intricate plot elements. After all, a hero is only as good as his nemesis right? Dominic Greene's machinations may not be as ambitious as other villains of the franchise, but his schemes do hit a little close to what is happening today. It has that obtuse grand corporate scheme blended in a conspiracy of modern fear that we can relate to--dressed up as something nice is something quite wicked.<br /><br />With its fast-paced elaborate scheme hatched up by the villain, Bond finds himself in a very uncomfortable position--almost playing a rogue agent with only M (Judi Dench) as the one ally he can trust. All these results in what else? Fast-paced action sequences that are done with near-excellent precision. The action has that somewhat of a \\"Jason Bourne\\" feel and it wouldn't be surprising since they were choreographed by Dan Bradley who did the \\"Bourne\\" franchise. The opening act gives you a hint of exactly what you are in for, the car chase in the opening act was exciting, quick and intense. The fights are nicely staged but somehow lacked the in your face brutality and attitude of the ones from \\"Casino Royale\\". Nonetheless, it is all very exciting as Bond performs elaborate stunts and over-the-top coolness which has been the trademark of the franchise. I do however, feel that \\"Quantum of Solace's\\" action sequences shows Bond as a sort of a super-agent, that he almost feels truly invincible. This change of tone does hurt the film a little as I was really impressed with the emotional attachments portrayed in \\"Casino Royale\\", an \\"invincible\\" James Bond does seem a little out of place when judged in the groundwork as established by the first film.<br /><br />I know what you are wondering does this James Bond have a troupe of sexy beautiful women? Well, Craig's Bond has two this time around, Camille a young agent with a past who also lusts for vengeance (played by sexy Olga Kurylenko) and a member of the British consulate named Strawberry Fields (Gemma Atherton). Camille is a character quite parallel to Bond; I liked Kurylenko's portrayal of a sassy, sexy agent and aids the film`s emotional weight. Gemma Atherton makes quite an impression even with her limited screen time--she has a potential iconic scene similar to \\"Goldfinger\\"; only this time it isn't gold but oil. Along with Craig's great performance is Judi Dench's \\"M\\". She has that sort of a \\"motherly\\" yet very direct figure that can keep Bond in check.<br /><br />Is \\"Quantum of Solace\\" as good as \\"Casino Royale\\"? Well, it isn't--but I can safely say that it is a significant entry in this intended \\"James Bond trilogy\\". The film is entertainingly action-packed once it manages to hit its stride. It also scores some points on emotion as it manages to flesh out Bond's emotional journey and takes its time to settle down. Marc Forster's experience in dramatic films do come in handy, although some parts of the film felt a little heavy-handed. Plus, the film's main premise isn't really that complex and rather a little too predictable. Still, despite its flaws, the film is a worthwhile effort and does give a strong hint in the closing scene that the best is yet to come--which left me pleased.<br /><br />Highly Recommended! [4- Stars]<br />Video/Audio: 2.40 anamorphic widescreen that looks very nice up-converted to 1080p. Great vibrant colors and strong black levels. The 5.1 Dolby digital track is powerful and clear.<br />Extras: Music video, trailers, On location featurette, interviews with director, Behind the scenes/Olga Kurylenko boat sequence making of feature.James Bond have a troupe of sexy beautiful women?

So get a mind and think about the person who is suposed to writing the book!
B000B5MI3Q|1.0|I had a Seiko Men's Diver's Watch for about 10 years, and it was great.  Reading reviews on several of the Seiko models, I saw several complaints about watches gaining time; the SKX007K didn't have any of those complaints, so I went with it.  It arrived looking great, and worked very well... for about a month.<br /><br />Well, for the last two days it's been gaining between 5 and 10 minutes an hour.  I just emailed the seller (I'm in Iraq and can't call).  We'll see how responsive and user-friendly they are, but bear in mind your chances of getting a problem watch.  Check the number of positive reviews, count how many complaints of gaining time (and I don't mean something trivial like gaining 3 seconds a day), and calculate the chances of having to go through what I'm dealing with now.
0061120081|5.0|Author of [[ASIN:0473125382 Afinidad: A novel of a serial killer]]<br />To my mind, this is the best book ever written.  It has everything in it that a novel should have: unforgettable characters that you come to love, especially the two children at the heart of the novel, Scout, who narrates the story that takes place over three summer vacations, and her brother, Jem, but an erstwhile villain, Bo Radley, comes to find a place in your heart in the end as well; so descriptive of place and time (Alabama,1930s) that you have to re-orientate yourself to your own surroundings when you put the book down, and the superb regional dialogue plays no small part in that; and a truly interesting storyline that keeps you deeply involved until the last page. There is great drama in the book.  Scout's father is forced to confront a mob set on lynching a black man; Jem gets stalked by some terrifying presence one night; a rabid dog goes beserk and needs to be shot et al. Atticus is a fair-minded liberal lawyer choosing to defend a black man charged with raping a white woman.  This fact makes for some very tense scenes as this choice is not very popular at all in the early twentieth centure South. The writing is so powerful that you are on the edge of your seat as these scenes unfold, and that includes some great courtroom ones.  But there is so much more than drama in the book.  It is a truly heartwarming story of a father's love and respect for his children, and also the angst those children experience as they grow into maturity. Poor Scout, for instance, struggles with the then accepted notion of what a young Southern lady wears and how she behaves.<br />There is a persistent rumor that this book was written by Harper Lee's great childhood friend, Truman Capote, and that wouldn't surprise me at all.  I didn't get to Truman's books until years after reading and loving this one, but when I did, I thought the style of writing was exactly the same, and just as brilliant.  So I personally think that there may be some truth in the rumor, or at the very least, that he gave a great deal of assistance.....<br />As a bonus, it is a must for anyone who wants to gain insight into the Southern way of thinking seventy odd years ago.k that there may be some truth in the rumor, or at the very least, that he gave a great deal of assistance.....

I can't even remember the last time a book touched me so much.  I had to read it in one sitting cause I couldn't wait to find out what happened.  The story delves into the little known roundup of Jews by the French, and a little girl who locks her baby brother in a cupboard so he'll be safe, promising to come back and free him as soon as she can.  I always believed most French people were involved with the underground, but apparently this is not so.  This is one of the very best holocaust books I've ever read and I highly recommend it to everyone.  It should be required reading in schools.

This book picks up after Darcy discoverers Rachel and Darcy's fiance Dex had an affair and after Darcy's own affair leaves her pregnant with her fiance's best friend's baby.<br /><br />I didn't like Darcy after reading the first book, and even after reading this book I'm still not a big fan of Darcy's. But this book was still pretty good. I liked that the story picks up where the first one left off. We're not left to wonder what happened in the time between, because there is no time between.<br /><br />The characters are still as great as they were in the first book. They are well rounded and I still felt like I knew them.<br /><br />Darcy tries to make a turn-around but I still felt that she was self-absorbed. I have to admit that I like her more at the end of the book than I did at the beginning, but she's still mot my favorite person.<br /><br />Even despite the fact that I didn't like the main character I would still say this was a really good book. Emily Giffin is great writer for her genre. She knows how to write Chick Lit and does it well.

B000OCZ0ZO|5.0|What I've Done starts off with '' In this farewell there is no change, there is no allaby.'' Joe Hahn said in the dvd that its a song about where they basically are now. Forgetting past and moving on. Which is exactly what Linkin Park did. What I've Done was the last song they recorded in the studio and did. I personally don't get why people really bash this cd. I own every Linkin Park cd and I love their old style and new style. I personally wouldn't want another Hybrid Theory 3. Everyone complains that it goes straight to the ''f'' bomb. People says explict lyric what does that tell you?? When in anyone mind would think Linkin Park would use acoustics or a guitar solo. NEVER. Which is also what is really surprising on this record. In order for alot of bands to survive they need to change their sound. If you really think about it you wouldn't want them to sound the same on every cd. To me for some reason people need angry music and if it isn't and a band does something different then right away they think they sold out when maybe just maybe they just wanted to do something different. The dvd is great it explains everything about the cd and why they changed their sound. Of course with them in the studio. Eventhough the wrote up to I think almost 200 demos for this cd they said that they were mostly all crap. They have some moments in the cd and some that relate to their old style. Wake is an intro track that sounds epic with that old Linkin Park feel to it. Given up is a done right Linkin Park rocker but is all Chester lyrically in it. One thing different with this song is he does a 30 second scream on it. Leave Out All the Rest reminds of old LP. Almost sounds like Crawling. Phoenix is on guitar in this song and not bass. The rhythm section in this song is keyboard. Bleed it Out is a party like song with Mike rapping in it and the band says its a fun song to do live. Shadow Of The Day I would agree sounds alot like a U2 song but to me it is a beautiful song. WhatI've Done sounds alot like a typical LP song with a little bit of a guitar solo. Hands Held High is more of a political rap song all by Mike on this with a bit of Chester in the background vocals on the chorus. It also has oregon in it. No More Sorrow is another typical LP rocker. It has a really cool guitar opener and comes in with the drums. It has political like sound to it though and is basically about liers and hyporcrites with Chester screaming. Valentines Day is more of a love song and to me is about Chesters divorce. Its pretty light and but gets progressively heavier but its one of my least favorites on this cd. In Between is another light song its all mike singing on this one and is a pretty simple form. In the dvd Chester originally sang this song but he thought Mike sounded better on it. Personally also not a favorite but kudos for them doing something different. In Pieces sounds like another kind of love song but it has reggae guitars and is a bit progressive and its a song that grows on you. The Little Things Give you Away is about hurricane Katrina and has banjo and acoustic guitars in it with electric too. It has a over a 2 minute guitar solo. Rob Bourdon made a drum demo that they named drum song. The band visited New Orleans and wrote the vocals from that. The only thing I really missed on this cd was Mikes rapping and Joe Hahns scratching were all limited. How they decided the songs on this recorded were by seeds and basically each one came in with music and presented it. It was then determined if it was to survive the process since they voted on the songs. Linkin Park is currently in the studio now it seems like they will have a new cd out in 2010. The band from what I understand and I don't know if its fully true is working on a concept record with a storyline. Cant wait to see what they try new on their next cd!! Hopefully I will get their new cd the day it comes out like I did with all their others.

By the way I have a great sound system produced by yamaha and every other concert sounds like I was there.
B0001CCXZW|3.0|When I purchased this product it was advertised as new.  When I went to view the DVD's several of the disks were scratched and only would play on one of my DVD players.  Needless to say I was disappointed with the quality of the product.  The content however is quite a different story.  I always love the quick witted banter of mother and daughter.
031606792X|5.0|I really LIKED how this series ended.  But then, I enjoy books and movies that end with hope and the knowledge of love.  And I would never have expected some of the surprises that Stephenie Meyer came up with in this finale!  The only thing that spoiled the anticipation of finally reading this last book were all the other people's reviews!  I only read a few (they obviously had a LOT to say), but since they gave away just about every single twist and turn, well, they might as well have been sitting with me when I first saw \\"Sixth Sense\\" and telling me Bruce Willis was actually a ghost almost from the beginning!  I know that some of the things that happened were predicted in the previous books, but I certainly didn't have a clue about all the other things!  Not until I read those reviews, that is.  So hopefully, whoever reads the reviews will not be deterred by others' opinions, even mine, and will enjoy the book as the fitting conclusion it is.  People who have suffered, especially as much as Bella and Edward have, SHOULD be happy.  I only wish that were true in the real world...

0618680004|1.0|Dawkins believes he has the facts while religionists only have faith. Well, then, he must have a lot of faith in his facts! Faith is inescapable. I only need to add six words to his evolutionary argument: \\"So that's how God did it.\\" After all, God has no need to be in a hurry. God may be an evolutionist. In fact, God may be evolving. After all, Yahweh, the warrior finally became Love.
0156030209|2.0|The Booker Prize?  You've got to be kidding!  Sure, The Life of Pi is charming and well-written.  And sure, there's a nice twist at the end that deepens the whole tale.  But c'mon: this book is, in the end, riddled with problems.  The most egregious problem is also the most wonderful aspect of the book: the ending twist.  Without spoiling it, let's say that the twist hinges on a transformation of consciousness.  This would work beautifully except that we cannot believe the \\"facts\\" it means to retrieve.  By the time we reach the turn we have seen far too many problems with the story.  The turn, in short, cannot return the fantastic tale to one of truth.       Relatedly, the book (until the end) reads like magical realism or a dream.  This stole from the emotions of the book: I never felt fear of sharks, the tiger, the strange island, or the sea.  I drifted over the story as passive as flotsam, not worried or emotional about the fate of Pi, uncaring about his lite ideas about religion.       On a positive note, the pages fly past.  The prose is hopping and spare.  Yann has appreciable talents as a writer.  Unfortunately he hasn't a lot to say.  Ultimately the success of The Life of Pi hinges on the transformative ending that wasn't.  In this sense the novel functions like many short stories: only this one goes on for 400 pages.

B000002UB3|5.0|This was the first album I owned as a child in the late 1960's, and it's difficult to find something better...The polished arrangements, the crystal clarity of the sound, the performances - all phenominal. From the opening riff of \\"Come Together\\", featuring John Lennon on not only vocal, but lead guitar as well,this track is rock, blues, and funk all-in-one...As for George Harrison's \\"Something\\", it's hard to pick an all-time favorite song, but this is it for me. The lyrics, melody, bass line, tempo change at the bridge, just enough orchestration, not to mention George's outstanding vocal and guitar solo all make for a perfect 3-minute masterpiece...George's other contribution, \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", is no less brilliant and sheer joy...Paul McCartney's contributions range from 23 seconds of \\" Her Majesty\\" to the banality of \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" to the raw emotion of \\"Oh! Darling\\" and the magnificence of the long medley.Ringo too is represented by his own composition, \\"Octopus's Garden\\",which features wonderful harmonies as well as another superb guitar solo from George...John's other major contributions the epic 7-minute \\"I want you (she's so heavy)\\" and the Beethoven influenced \\"Because\\" show his versatility as a composer. From \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" through to \\"The End\\", two well crafted medleys are strung together, finishing up with Ringo's economic but effective drum solo, followed by Paul, George, and John (in that order) dueling it out on electric guitars. Top to bottom, sheer magnificence. They saved their best for last...

You should definitely read City of Glass.
B0000009SM|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of my favorite Zappa discs. From Inca Roads to Evelyn, a Modified Dog, to Sofa #2, this 'album' takes you on a trip through the mind of the most creative and most prolific composer in modern history. Zappa was so far ahead of his time as to be ridiculed and demeaned by all but the most talented musicians. I think the great composer's time is coming. This disc will help those of you who are unfamiliar, become familiar. Those who already know and love him have to own this. \\"Arf\\", she said.
B001MYIXAW|1.0|Let the Right One In is a beautiful film that I would liken to Pan's Labyrinth as a successful modern-day \\"fairy tale\\".  The acting is awesome (especially from the child actors), the mood is tense, and the film's conclusion, despite being non-ambiguous, leaves the audience with a lot to ponder if they choose to do so.      Do not buy the Blu-Ray or DVD released by Magnet.  They intentionally dropped the theatrical subtitles and replaced them with a heavily \\"dumbed down\\" version that sacrifices the mood of the story.  Magnet claims that they will reissue the DVD and Blu-Ray with the correct subtitles.  You can be certain you have the Theatrical subtitles by looking on the disc information on the back of your DVD and checking to see if it says \\"English (Theatrical\\" under subtitles. (This re-release has not happened, as of yet.)      What this means is that if you want to see Let the Right One In as it was intended, you will have to import the DVD or Blu-Ray from Sweden or some other country. (Quick note:  The Swedish Blu-Ray is region free.)
B001LRJH0U|3.0|Actually, it is really 3 and one-half stars for a rating. . .    I was not aware of the movie until I picked up a recent copy of \\"Guns of the Old West,\\" a periodical put out by Harris Publications.  In it was an article about the guns used in \\"Appaloosa.\\"  That got my interest going.    Comparing the movie to the book is a little difficult for me, even though most of the book was transferred into the movie.  I understand, as the director, co-producer, co-writer Ed Harris easily choose who he wanted for what parts and while I'm not complaining about most parts, I just didn't think Rene Zellwegger was right for the part, as it was written anyway.  The character needed to be fleshed out more (literally and figuratively) to better fit the Book to movie transformation.  Yes, I understand it was shot with a limited budget, but it was a weak point.  Some have stated why they couldn't understand her even being a part of it; well it's simple.  She throws the monkey wrench into the \\"keep focused on the job at hand\\" that Virgil and Everett had been doing for years.  Love can be like that!     The relationship between the lead male characters is a bit similar to Gus and Woodrow in Lonesome Dove, most notable when Everett is grabbing Virgil off the Teamster.    I bought the movie, in all honesty, because of the article in the gun magazine, and the interest in the 8-gauge.  Sometimes, it's better to have a movie in your \\"personal library\\" than to go off to the rental store, or library, and get it.
0316017922|3.0|The author puts forth a few interesting sociological conclusions backed up by some statistical data and the stories of successful entrepreneurs.  However, I felt it lacked some depth and it therefore left me feeling that his conclusions were mostly common sense.    I have given it to a 12 year old that I tutor specifically for the chapter on 10,000 hours to mastery.  I hope that the book will help him understand that we never know when opportunities come to us, and so we have to stay vigilant, in a way, in our search for those interactions.  If it does that, then its a helluva book.
0805047905|4.0|Somehow my childhood years were completely void of any Eric Carle books - only within the past 3 years have I even learned of him.<br /><br />My son is now 10 months old and we are attending reading circle at the library - and one day I happened to stumble upon this book at the end of the class when the librarian dumped a pile of books on the floor for children to browse through.<br /><br />I immediately liked it.  The story line is simplistic - a single animal with a certain color is named, and then asked what they see.  Their answer becomes the next animal in line to be asked that question - \\"Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?  I see a red bird looking back at me.  Red bird, Red bird what do you see? I see a yellow duck, looking back at me!\\".<br /><br /> The rhythm and rhyme that I associate with good children's books is enchanting.  The rest of the book progresses with a blue horse, a green frog, a purple cat, a white dog, a black sheep, a goldfish, and then a teacher.  At the end of the book, you find a classroom of \\"children\\" looking back at the teacher.  When they are asked what do they see, they respond by naming all of the animals in order again \\"looking back at us\\".  Very few children's authors are capable of teaching sequencing, colors, nature, rhythm, repetition, and rhyme in one short story.  This book handles it beautifully.<br /><br />We've currently had the book out on loan for about 7 weeks now and my son absolutely loves it - he squeals and bounces up and down with the rhythm of the story.  I've read it so many times that I know have it memorized.  My dad and husband even have it memorized. (haha)<br /><br />As much as I love the book, though, I can only give it 4 stars because 2 things stick out to me.<br /><br />1.  In this board book edition, I find it odd that there are no foreshadowing clues to indicate WHAT the animal \\"sees\\".  It would seem logical that the words \\"I see a red bird looking back at me\\" should appear either on the same page as the full red bird, or either a clue (a red tale, a beak, etc) would appear beside the words to foreshadow what comes next. But it doesn't.  Each stanza appears on one page, with one animal - for instance, on the page with the bear, the text reads \\"Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see? I see a red bird looking at me\\".  Then you flip the page to go on to the next character.  There is no way for the baby / toddler to associate what the animal \\"sees\\" when the actual statement is made.<br /><br />2.  The teacher & the classroom turned me off a little.  I would much prefer a different ending (such as with a family member appearing), especially in a board book edition.  But that's just my personal preference. :)d tale, a beak, etc) would appear beside the words to foreshadow what comes next. But it doesn't.

B0012Q732O|4.0|Fundamentally, this is a story about a myth's being made.  It is easy to forget that it is a story within a story.  If that memory is lost during the movie, the ending may seem contrived.  If that memory is retained, the viewer will realize that the story develops the process of myth construction common to virtually all cultures and suggests the reason that myths are a necessary part of a culture.  The characters are well acted, and the set was very realistic.  The pace of the story might seem slow to people oriented to movies with a new car wreck or gun fight every five seconds.  Nevertheless, the pacing fits the story, and this script simply doesn't lend itself to a shoot-em-up. In many respects, this film has classic properties.
B001PPLIFU|1.0|I'm a big fan of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films, and to me he is by far the best Bond ever. Casino Royale was a decent movie, even if it didn't have all too many gadgets. This movie has none, Q doesn't even appear. The movie is hard to follow as well, and if you haven't seen Casino Royale you have no chance. As for the blu-ray version, it isn't presented in true 16X9 so there are bars on the top and bottom. From my point of view MGM needs to get their act together and get rid of Daniel Craig (not because he's a horrible actor, but because Bond has dark brown hair, not blond. Come on, at least be true to the books.), bring back the gadgets, Bond girls and action.
0679721037|5.0|I have heard a student say 'Why not Nagasaki?  There were two bombs.'  (Isn't Hiroshima enough is my thought  rejoinder.)      On that date, August 6, 1945, a B-29 raid was feared.  Only Hiroshima and Kyoto had been spared B-29 attacks.  Hiroshima is fan-shaped.  Japanese radar detects only three planes.  Almost no one in Hiroshima hears any noise of a bomb.  The maimed, wounded, and dying go to the Red Cross Hospital.  Ultimately ten thousand people seek treatment.  It resembles an invasion.      Afterwards Hiroshima is a dreadful miasma.  A child wants to know why it is night already.  A private hospital seems to be in the river.  One survivor's hair turns white two months after the explosion.  The following day the President of the United States identifies the bomb as atomic.  Later people come down with radiation sickness.      A uranium bomb exploded at Hiroshima, and a more powerful plutonium bomb at Nagasaki.  The author's narrative focuses on six Hiroshima victims, persons whose lives would never be the same.  Waging total war encompasses civilian casualties.  Hersey is surprised that many of the victims aren't much concerned with the ethics of the bombing.      Excerpts of this superior journalistic work have made their way into American textbooks.  The trend is heartening.
1439102813|5.0|Alice Howland is leading a pretty good life. At fifty years old she is a Professor of Cognitive Psychology at Harvard and is an expert in linguistics. Her husband John is a respected research scientist also at Harvard. They have 3 adult children and a happy marriage.  As Alice begins to notice that she is becoming forgetful and losing things more often she chalks it up to menopause, stress, over work and her very busy life. When she gets lost just a few blocks from her home on a route she knows by heart she knows something is wrong. Scheduling an appointment to see a neurologist she is preparing herself for a diagnosis of a brain tumor. What she gets is a diagnosis of Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease and everything in her life will never be the same.<br /><br />Lisa Genova has written a powerful and deeply moving book of the descent into Alzheimer's from the point of view of Alice. By putting a very human face on this disease, we are drawn into the destruction of this illness, not only Alice's losses, but those of her friends, colleagues and family.  I found the writing to be beautiful and felt I really knew Alice and took this journey with her. It has changed the way I think about this disease and its devastating effects.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever dealt with any overwhelming medical diagnosis can relate to many of the situations portrayed in this story.  The most significant message of all is that those who love you and that you have loved are the most important parts of your life, for they will hold their memories of you in their hearts and minds, even if you can't remember them.
1594481938|3.0|Four people meet on New Year's Eve on the top of a tall building with the same goal in mind. But because of a lack of privacy, they cannot jump. Instead, they agree to spend the next 90 days as semi-friends until they determine whether they really want to go through with it. These are four very different people, and each gets a shot at telling the story from his or her own point of view. The problem is that none of it really gels or becomes a real story--it just feels like a novelty act, a \\"what if\\" scenario that never grows legs.
0887306667|3.0|If you are \\"new\\" to the subject of business marketing or just want to get back to basics, this book is a great place to start.  The authors support their arguments with abundant examples and the book is a quick, easy read.  If you want more explanation or detail, you will need to look elsewhere.  Anyone who owns or runs a business needs to realize that there are many marketing variables to be considered and this book certainly helps to underscore that point.  The 3 most significant \\"laws\\" to me were the Laws of Perception, Perspective, and Line Extension.  Re-read and think about these often.

B0013FSL3E|2.0|I don't understand these 5 star ratings.  Why was this film made?  I won't go into details and rip this piece to shreds.  My family has watched Monster's Inc. over a dozen times.

My kids have not seen it since the first and only viewing the day after Christmas.  Enough said!
1440468397|4.0|Although also a romance like Austen's better known novels, Emma and Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is a subtle one, with a theme not of whirlwind passion but of constancy and devotion. The main character, Anne Elliott, was very much in love with Captain Wentworth as a young girl, but was persuaded by friends and family to reject him as a husband. Broken-hearted, Wentworth went to sea, and the novel actually begins when he re-enters Anne's life eight years later, having made his career and his money.<br /><br />Anne is a character to whom the reader can easily relate: introspective, analyzing everything and flawed, able to make make mistakes and recover from them. She narrowly averts an unhappy life by not letting her friends and family persuade her again to marry her cousin, who has money and manners but turns out to be quite despicable. And while Captain Wentworth does not have the dash or charm of a Mr. Darcy, he is Anne's one true love, as prone to the follies of a broken heart as she is subject to the strong influence of those around her.<br /><br />The underlying theme is about choices and following one's heart. If Anne had only listened to her own feelings instead of allowing others to sway her, she would have found happiness sooner. Despite what seems like an afterthought of a speech at the end of the novel, when Anne justifies her earlier behavior, this seems to be a strongly feminist novel, advocating the rights of women to choose their own way in life and their own partners for life, rather than be guided solely by considerations of fortune and class.<br /><br />This is also one of Austen's funnier novels, particularly the scenes featuring Anne's sisters and father, who are incredibly self-absorbed. Their dialogue--constantly misreading the situation in their own favor or stating something when the opposite is true--brings a welcome lightheartedness to the story.
B000K1P66W|4.0|The first time I read \\"The Four Agreements\\", or looked through it, I didn't like it. It seemed simplistic and the writting was not particularly inspiring. At some point, over the years since first discovering, it transformed in my head from annoying to revealing. So, I rated it a 4 beacuse I think the IDEAS and wisdom of the book are 5 star, and the writting and story line are , maybe 3 1/2.     However, It's a small book, and it's the kind of thing you can just \\"keep around\\" in the seat pocket of your car or in your suitcase or whatever and look at parts here and there over time.
0385338732|5.0|I have to say this book was great! I read it in two days! It was fun to \\"meet\\" the characters as Lexi met them in the book. This book was a humorous yet telling story about what it would be like to wake up with no memory and to have to lead a life that you have no idea how to navigate, to live with a husband that you don't remember meeting. I felt for Lexi as she tried to live the life she was told she had and to follow the rules that she set for herself in the yerars that she lost!     I hope these characters lead to another great series of books!
006135323X|5.0|Prof. Ariely does a great job capturing why we make/don't make the decisions we do. Why free is powerful motivator and the results of the halloween candy dilemma tests alone are enough to warrant buying the book. If you are a marketeer - for consumer or business - or if you are a consumer (and aren't we all) this book is a must read. The insights into our thought processes are valuable and long-lasting. You won't be able to put it down.
B001GQACGO|3.0|Although Bee tried to be different by offering two discs filled with songs that represented the two sides of her performance personality, what causes the project to not succeed fully is Disc 2.  There are simply not enough strong tracks on this disc to hold my attention.<br /><br />I thought that SINGLE LADIES was the best track to set the album off.  It's a very infectious, catchy, make u wanna get up & dance track!  The only other tracks that I keep on repeat are: SWEET DREAMS - excellent track that kind of reminds me of songs from the late '80s; HELLO - love her phrasing and the sentiment and EGO.<br /><br />Disc 1 features ballads & mid-tempo tracks that for the most part really showcase the improvement in her vocal skills.  I like the fact that she mixed using the current pop/synth sound of soaring string sections with a few really stripped down tracks.  My standout tracks are: IF I WERE A BOY, SMASH INTO YOU, DISAPPEAR, HALO, AVE MARIA (really pretty track, love when she hits those high notes), SATELLITES (very ambitious track, hope it's released as a single) & BROKEN HEARTED GIRL.<br /><br />So that's 11 good tracks from a double disc set.  I wish that instead of using such a gimmick, she'd simply selected the strongest tracks and put together what definitely could've been one great album versus what we got which is one good disc and a barely listenable, mediocre one.<br /><br />I do applaud her efforts to stay ahead of the pack and to present different genres of music, it's just that unfortunately for me as a listener, the \\"Sasha Fierce\\" side did not translate.

1416914307|4.0|You know, I have never felt the need to write a book review but after reading the few books reviews on here, and then reading the book I felt I needed to give my thoughts on this book. I know a lot of people are saying the book was 100 percent predictable but for me it was not like that.<br /><br />I mean, sure I could see where some of the plot lines were going but I did not see the ending by a long shot. I honestly liked this book the most out of all three. The first book had me wondering if I should even continue to read the series because it did fall a bit flat in the way of creativity and over use of common themes. But once I start a series I must finish it. I am REALLY glad I did.<br /><br />The author wrapped up everything very well for me. I am a huge Twilight fan, or I used to really but I bought it up because I think I like this series even more then that because it was fresh by the third and final book. It was not bland and the characters had actual depth to them unlike in twilight. I like the different sides to each person that are presented clearly in each book by this Author.<br /><br />So thank you Ms. Clare for your works and I hope to see more from you in the future. I truly enjoyed your series and I hope this review gets to be read by you. :) thank you again.

1595141979|5.0|In a sea of vampire novels out there, I have to say the Vampire Academy series is one of the best I've read.  Once I started reading Shadow Kiss I was hooked and couldn't put it down until I'd finished it all in one sitting.  After finishing it, I was lost in a daze and couldn't stop thinking about this story.  Rose is a gread leading character (and when I read I picture her as the girl who played Faith on Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and the tension between her and Dimitri is incredible.  I am not a typical teenager and am actually in my twenties and a language teacher.  I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who enjoys paranormal romance and I think I can say I enjoyed it even better than the Twilight series!  All I can say is that I cannot wait until August to go out and get the next book!!
B000065DWH|5.0|This is Randy Newman's best.  Not just because I moved to the South from San Jose, California in May of 1999.  His words and music combine so powerfully in this set of songs.

B00004XMV6|1.0|This is high-gloss soft-porn; a boring soap opera concentrating on one thing: sex. They actually made sex boring, sad to say, because I defy you to watch this casually and tell me what the storyline was.     What this is, is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show off her great body and for Mickey Rourke to smirk a lot. That's it. Rourke's smugness is so bad it's sickening and Bassinger, despite the great figure, looks cheap more than beautiful.    Kudos to the photographer for some nice closeup shots and some wonderful color, but the story is so weak - no character development and no plot - it's unable to compensate. Let's face it: this movie was made for only reason - to titillate male viewers. On that level, it probably succeeded.     Those trying to pass this off as \\"arty\\" and something deeper than soft porn are only fooling themselves.

Its a quick read 2-4 hours and is a book that should be on every web designer's book shelf.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|Quantum of Solace does not live up to the promise of Casino Royale. Although director Marc Foster has done great work in the past with Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland, and The Kite Runner, Foster's not an action director.  Sorry, he's not.  Character, story, and action are neither shaken nor stirred but scrambled.  Daniel Craig can do so much more than jump from one stunt to the next as he does here - see Layer Cake, Defiance, and yes, Casino Royale.
9562911640|5.0|I found out about this book on Twitter.  One of my twitter friends 'tweeted' that it was one of the best books that he's read. In his tweet he posted a link to the amazon page. When I got to it, I was glad to read that the book was back in print.<br /><br />Now, I realize that the book is floating around on the internet as an ebook but I prefer to have the real thing.<br /><br />After having read this book, I have to add it to my list of the top 10 books that I've read in my life. I've read many of the classic books like Think and Grow Rich, The Power of Positive Thinking, Law of Success, etc.<br />And in many ways, I prefer this book.<br /><br />The closest book that I've read that is similar to this book is Three Magic Words by US Andersen. I really believe that we have greater control over our circumstances than we realize. One of the other reviewers stated that some of the more prominent self-help coaches and gurus don't really believe that you control 100% of your results.<br /><br />Now, the problem with that thinking is that it defies the laws of the universe.  The world we 'see' is the world of effects that have definite 'causes' and those causes originate in the world within.  So, it's our job as spiritual beings to focus our thoughts on the things we desire and trust that The Universal Mind will show us the ways and means, in other words, 'the how' of achieving our desires.  Once we receive divine guidance on the 'how' then we must take action.<br /><br />The book provides a lot of practical advice for people in the areas of health, relationships, and business. One particular line in the book that I thought possessed great truth was when he said,<br /><br />'Difficulties and obstacles will continue to come until we absorb their wisdom and gather from them the essentials of further growth'<br /><br />This is a book that you need to read slowly. Take your time with it and let your mind absorb the great Truths that are presented by the author.<br /><br />After you've finished reading this book, you will truly realize that you have no excuses for the results that you are manifesting in your life. And for those of you who are relatively succesful, you too will benefit from this book.<br /><br />John Hinds<br />Author of \\"What's In Your Water?\\"at you have no excuses for the results that you are manifesting in your life.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|Pinocchio, is a classic film. The film is a great tale of right and wrong.      I have read some of the negative reviews. I think they are off target in their critiques of both this DVD edition and of the film itself.    This DVD edition has some great extra features. The video and audio are excellent. It is a must buy for any fan, old and new, of any age.    \\"Let your conscience be your guide.\\"
B0001KZM3O|4.0|The Final Cut was the last album with Roger Waters and it is an album that was a great success. It peaked at #1 in the UK album charts, #6 in the billboard 200 and #1 in Norway. Singles release from this album where \\"Not Now John\\", \\"Your Possible Pasts\\", and The Hero's Return\\". I think it is a good album, but it is not as good as the follow up album \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\". I have an aversion to political music and this is way to political at times. 4/5.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I have tried to write a review for this a few different times this week.  I am finding it hard to put words together to describe this collection of 7 songs from the Atlanta, GA foursome.  One thing I will say is that these songs are well crafted pieces of metal and progressive rock.  Mastodon draws from their roots, but they are also evolving.  There is a nice blend of guitar riffs, guttural death growls, vocal harmonies, thundering bass lines, jazzy drumming and newly added keyboard textures.  My favorite is the closing track The Last Baron, which rocks from pure metal to crazy progressive indulgence.  I am really enjoying this album, and with each listen, I love it more and more...<br /><br />I highly recommend getting and watching this DVD version.  The making of this album video talks about Brent Hinds struggle to return to form after a serious injury as well as Brann Dailor's dark memory of his sister's passing and tribute to Skye via the name of the album and the title track.  There is also a track by track commentary and analysis by the band, which is great and much better than my track by track review of the album would be here.  Not to mention, these guys are funny and really honest straightforward dudes, and their honesty comes across in their music as pure.  Great band and great album.

The result is a good album but it is not as good as the prior album (What's the Story) Morning Glory?. The songs are very long and sometimes the sound is a bit bloated. The album did amazing and topped the charts in countries such as France, Austria, Sweden and the UK. Songs that standout on this release are \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\" , \\"Stand by Me\\", and \\"All Around the World\\". 4/5.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|My normal policy is to not write reviews for products that already have 10 or more reviews, and I know that this review will disappear into oblivion in a month or so, probably after netting several \\"unhelpful\\" votes. So why bother? Because this film, despite its almost universally positive reception, got my hackles up.    The Will Smith character, Chris Gardner, is portrayed as being a loving and caring father who is doing everything he's doing for the sake of his 5-year-old son. Nonsense. Chris Gardner is doing what he is doing primarily for himself. Yes, he does take good care of his son, but the final result is positive only because things do work out for him in the end.    What if it had all gone horribly wrong? For every person who attempts to do what Chris Gardner did, and succeeds, there are 100 who attempt it and fail. What then? What would the consequences have been for Chris Gardner's son?     My claim is that a really responsible father would have bitten the bullet and taken an ordinary job and settled down to being a single father and living a simple life, instead of gambling everything on \\"the American dream\\". Doing what Chris Gardner did, while it did succeed for him, was, in fact, irresponsible.    Another irritating aspect of this movie is that to a large extent it pushes the idea that money and happiness go hand-in-hand. Those who are rich are all portrayed as being happy and decent people, which in my experience is far from the truth.    And then there's the problem of whether Chris Gardner's chosen profession is admirable or meaningful in the general context of human activities. My understanding of financial markets is almost zero, but I got the impression that Mr. Gardner was becoming successful by selling the kind of financial constructions that have since become part of the Wall Street meltdown and the trigger to a global financial crisis.    My conclusion is that \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is a Hollywood \\"feel-good\\" movie that doesn't stand upto a more critical examination.    Rennie Petersen

1423101464|5.0|This is a delightful book. We enjoyed it better than many of the other hit books out there that in the same genre. My son enjoyed it, I enjoyed it and my mother enjoyed reading this book as well.<br /><br />My son read this and loved it. He is 10 years old. However, one of the other main characters is a girl and I think girls would enjoy this book just as much as my son did.<br /><br />We studied Greece and Ancient Greece and Greek Mythology and Greek Gods. My son became interested in learning more. While I would not say that this book is educational, it does have a lot of interesting information about some of the Greek Gods.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers though, this book will mean so much more and make so much more sense if you read it in order from book one through to the end.<br /><br />Well worth the money.<br />Enjoy.

But you can't have everything.
039925045X|5.0|(This review is Specific to the Hardcover Giant version priced around fifty dollars, but it will be grouped due to this sites issues with all Hungry reviews)<br /><br />I just purchased the Giant Hardcover version of this excellent classic now in its 40th year. It came in a beautiful, beautiful big box with lovely thick glowing pages, a treasure for a classroom. (The only negative might be that I have to repeatedly do this from my own pocket with California continuing to disgrace public education in its lack of funding  and the national sideshow to keep teacher's pounded while they do exactly that, get what they need out of their teacher's pocket, most often with no thanks. Or worse while treating them disrespectfully. However it's just to be expected now I suppose.)<br /><br />That said this is just beautiful.<br />It is a book about transformation. I am a 1st grade teacher delighted to be able to use it as I develop lessons for my class. What is happening, of course, is that they are taking the stories read to them not long ago and then reading them to one another and beginning their journey into literacy with books like this. It is, as Carle said in a tape I own of him discussing his book making,  of his making, easing the journey from home to school, making it more comfortable and a better experience.<br /><br />This story of the caterpillar munching away teaches on so many levels, formal and informal- from love of color, to fascination with the holes( the gimmick if you will), from the life cycle of this butterfly, to the days of the week, the idea of change...it's rich with possibilities and spawned the idea for derivative books my class is making this week and many joyful moments acting out and reading the text.<br /><br />Who might want such a big book?<br />It's a great thing to donate to a primary teacher, I'd have loved it when my children were young, it might be a really exciting gift to a family with several youngsters 1 to 7 in age that might enjoy a really exciting special big gift, something that celebrates books, perhaps combined with a butterfly kite. That would be just a great combination if someone could afford it. You'd be giving something extraordinary. (And it could then one day rest with their children.)<br /><br />Carle is among my favorite writers for younger children, and make no mistake, what appears simple and so easy is the product of someone that has done their personal work to a very high level. Distilled something to an essence. That this is 40 years old amazes me. It's the year to say, \\"thank you Eric Carle\\" for a wonderful contribution to literacy.eally exciting special big gift, something that celebrates books, perhaps combined with a butterfly kite.

0547133510|5.0|A Bear Called Paddington is a book not so well known in the U.S. as in the U.K. which is a shame since it is so much fun.  The language is wonderful and I do not recommend this book for ages below five as most children will not understand a lot of what is going on. There are other Paddington picture books more suited to the younger child. That said, there is a lot of great vocabulary in this book for kids to learn as you read.  My six year old absolutely loved this particular Paddington book and he laughed a great deal.  We read one or two chapters a night and I do believe he would have loved to read the whole thing in one go.  Paddington is a very lovable bear and Bond's characterization of him is fabulous.  We plan to read Paddington Here and Now next and I hope it is as well written.
031606792X|4.0|I almost skipped Breaking Dawn after reading the conflicting reviews posted here on Amazon.com. Although I have to agree with some of the less-than-positive comments, I found that I did enjoy this fourth book of the Twilight saga.     To me, the fact that the \\"Twilight\\" saga involved me, overall, to the point that I was reacting emotionally to the characters, whether positively or negatively, meant that the fiction had achieved it's  purpose, which is entertainment.  These books are fantasy, not reality...although the cult that appears to be developing around these four novels does make one wonder if there are some that are unable to distinguish the difference.    All in all, I found Breaking Dawn to be both an entertaining and enjoyable read.  Enjoy it for what it is and grant the author the respect of deciding the fate of her characters.  Obviously, this ending felt right to Stephenie Meyer regardless of whether her readers/fans/critics  agree or disagree with her choices.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|It's hysterical. If you loved the movie itself, that alone is worth the price. Commentary: The Musical is fantastic. An additional comedy filled musical that pokes fun at the whole cast and crew with the cast and crew. Must have for anyone who has ever breathed.

0743455967|4.0|Great book. Tons of writing direction and insights to take away. The book develops a tremendous respect for King beyond his novel fandom. I hadn't read a King book in years, but this may be the one I enjoyed the most, because I feel like he really opened us into the working mind. This non-fiction is paced like King's best fiction writing even though the material is deeply personal.  The level of insight feels like he is revealing the secrets or giving away the keys to the kingdom.  Wish that more great writers would take this approach at some point in their career, very inspiring and interesting to anyone that ever wanted to write anything.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Mamma Mia may have been panned by the critics but everyone we know loved it. Never an Abba fan, these songs were perfect for a musical that needed little plot. Excellent performances all around, with tons of energy. Meryl Streep is amazing! (OK so Pierce Brosnan's singing was a little painful! If you watch the special features and see how intimidating the singing was for some of the actors, you have some sympathy for their performances.) The large group numbers are lots of fun and make you want to get up and dance. Don't always listen to the critics, \\"take a chance\\" with Mamma Mia.
B001W2I9Y4|4.0|First off I am a huge Mastodon fan.  I love the vocals and riffs that come along with their original style.  On the fist listen of Crack the Skye I was really disappointed.  Blood Mountain is one of my all time favorites and when I first the vocals I was really let down.  The music was still stellar, but the vocals were weak.  So I thought, until I found myself humming them all day long at work.  After I gave this album a few more spins I can't get it out of my head.  The shear complexity of each song is enough to keep any Mastodon fan satisfied.  Just be warned, you might actually learn to like the vocals.

1400082773|5.0|Nevermind being a fan of the President or not, this is a very good memoirs that stands on its own in the memoirs genre.  This was written when Obama became the first Black president of the Harvard Review and chronicles his life before his marriage in 1993. Many admissions are made of the President-to-be about adolescent drug use (which he dropped in time), questions of racial identity in America and his path to become a community organizer.<br />But the main thread remains his relationship with his mostly unknown father which Obama tries to come to terms with by travelling to Kenya. If you personally experience or know of someone having an identity crisis, you will connect to that book. How inspiring this book can be for a young Black man who never knew his dad, does not know what is place is in America because of his color! I believe it can be as inspiring for such an individual as it was seeing Obama become President.<br />Also, I appreciated his bits about life in Indonesia and his trip to Africa which uncovers insights that are not always too positive but, I suppose, realistic in some respects if not all. If you want to hear Obama say incredible things Amazon does not even want me to include in my review then, get the audio version of that book. Excellent memoirs, I recommend it highly.
B001EO2UKO|4.0|Safe Trip Home is a different sound for Dido.  If you are looking for the next CD as a logical progression from No Angel and Life For Rent, you will most likely be disappointed in Safe Trip Home.  That is not to say that Safe Trip Home is a bad CD, but it sees Dido go in a different direction.  Major life events often result in artistic changes, and Dido lost her father after completing Life For Rent.  I believe that this at least partially accounts for the more somber and pensive tone that Safe Trip Home has in comparison to her previous work.<br /><br />That being said, Safe Trip Home is not a mere sad lament to her father.  Dido still tackles relationships in earnest, but her tone has changed.  The opener \\"Don't Believe In Love\\" sees her in a more reserved and distrusting state than she was back on her first hit \\"Here With Me\\".  The string arrangements add a layer to the sadness in her voice.  The strings have this effect on \\"Quiet Times\\" too where Dido sings of loss, but this seems to be more directed toward another relationship gone bad than her father.  This theme continues through \\"Never Want To Say It's Love\\" and \\"Grafton Street\\".<br /><br />However, there are some brighter songs on Safe Trip Home.  \\"Us 2 Little Gods\\" is a folk tune that almost seems out of place among the other songs, but think of it as more of an oasis.  The most interesting song on Safe Trip Home is \\"Let's Do The Things We Normally Do\\".  While it is generally somber as the majority of the others, Dido uses a rhythmic vocal delivery, and the synthesizer gives it an added ethereal sound.  The winner of the \\"which one of these is not like the others\\" award, though, is \\"Northern Skies\\".  The electronics are stiff an overdone.  And while the song clocks in at just under nine minutes, there are nowhere near that many minutes of true music.  If this were trimmed back and arranged differently, it would not stick out as a blemish on an otherwise excellent CD.<br /><br />Overall, Safe Trip Home is a very good CD if you will allow for the change in style and mood.  It will be interesting to see if this is a lasting change or a temporary diversion.<br /><br />Download this:  Quiet Timesll allow for the change in style and mood.

0156029065|5.0|I swallowed this book as the most delicious dessert - as I did with other Eco's novels. He's getting older and maybe the mind game is not that powerful as in foucault's pendulum but his craft-man-ship-ness just increases.     Baudolino is almost epic. No, it is epic. As any epic novel which imply the hero's travel there and back. But still this epic canvas is underlaid with post-modern historical (in many ways) discussions.    Viva Umberto!

B001PA0FFO|4.0|The thing about Hoffman that always surprises me is his vast range of characters. He was great in \\"Before the devil knows you're dead\\" even though the film had an average storyline. Then in 2007 we had \\"The Savages\\" which I dare say is his best film. So when I heard praise about \\"Doubt\\", I knew that this was the film to watch out for. He is absolutely brilliant in his character and his dialogue delivery while narrating to a room full of adults and adolescents was wonderful. Meryl Streep kept him company and her stern, obstinate character was a treat to watch. The dialogues were good but it was the acting that made this film truly remarkable. This is the kind of self-proclaimed film critics like me love. You have to watch this. It goes right down to the wire and even after the film is over, you will feel like discussing it with that friend of yours who wants to be a book-writer someday. Excellent film overall. I only wish it was slightly longer but then that would have made it somehow flaky. Worth renting at the very least.

1847035612|5.0|As the author Richard Jones points out in the Preface to this new Third Edition, the Mental Capacity Act has been substantially amended by the Mental Health Act 2007 to put in place a procedure that can be used to take away the liberty of a mentally incapacitated person, following on from the Government's response to the finding of the European Court of Human Rights in \\"Bournewood\\".<br /><br />Jones's disapproval of all this is made quite clear. A highly respected authority on mental health law, he says in effect, that the Government could simply have made minor amendments to the Mental Health Act 1983 and still have achieved its objective.  Instead the new Act is, in the author's words, `hugely complex, voluminous, overly bureaucratic and difficult to understand, and yet provides mentally incapacitated people with minimum safeguards'.<br /><br />Is this yet another case, we ask ourselves, where too little clarity matched by, or caused by, a remote, careless and complacent bureaucracy has created yet another piece of flawed legislation which can impact seriously on the lives of ordinary folk, particularly the vulnerable?<br /><br />Well some people think so, notably the Joint Committee on Human Rights.  The author quotes here from the Committee's \\"Legislative Scrutiny: Mental Health Bill\\":<br /><br />\\"The proposals to amend the Mental Capacity Act are detailed and complex and we questions whether they will be readily understood by proprietors of residential care homes, even with the benefit of professional advice.\\"<br /><br />This is of course is only one example of the problem.  But it is as good a reason as any to acquire this book if you are a professional involved in this difficult and vexed area of law.<br /><br />The book provides a ready reference to -- and explanation of -- the scope of the MCA 2005.  Usefully, it clarifies the interaction between the Act and the Mental Health Act 2007, paying particular attention to the new 'Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards' following the `Bournewood' ruling.  There is also a supplement to the Code of Practice which provides guidance on the safeguards, as well as extensive quotations and references to the Code of Practice in the annotations.<br /><br />The book guides you section by section through the Act and covers all the changes and developments that have occurred since the Act was passed including:<br /><br />* The amendments made to the MCA 2005 by the Mental Health Act 2007<br /><br />* An analysis of the implications of the regulations which have been issues under the Act<br /><br />* An examination of the common law principles relating to incapacity<br />* An outline of the rules and responsibilities of the Court of Protection, and its role in dealing with disputes over care and treatment.<br /><br />For the practitioner specialising in Mental Health Law, the aptly named `Mental Capacity Act Manual' is particularly valuable, especially in its largely successful attempt to assign some clarity to that which is often opaque- the third edition is just the ticket with the current legislation now in force with the Codes of Practice.There is also a supplement to the Code of Practice which provides guidance on the safeguards, as well as extensive quotations and references to the Code of Practice in the annotations.

1592332803|3.0|This book is good for standard recipes that are veganized.  Like others have said, it's not too tough to substitute Ener-g egg replacer and Earth Balance for eggs and butter.      I've tried quite a few recipes to serve to my omni friends and family.  The chocolate chip cookies are good but nothing impressive.  The beverages (smoothies, teas, hot chocolates, etc) are good but again not that creative.  The German apple cake was really good, but I had to double the batter to make a decent portion.  The lemon cake turned out so moist it seemed greasy.  The Mediterranean loaf was bland and didn't really bake nicely (it turned out pretty tough with a tougher crust).      All in all, some of the recipes have bombed, some have been okay, but none have been extraordinary.  And you could have figured out most of them from standard easy vegan conversions.
B001MYIXAC|1.0|As the previous reviewer has stated, this movie, arguably a genre masterpiece in many critics and fans eyes, has English subtitles which differ wildy to those seen on theatre and DVD releases in other parts of the world and, as a result, a lot of the very subtle nuances and black humour of the movie is utterly 'lost in translation', and I mean that quite literally.    I understand that the distributor, Magnet, has recently released a statement apparently confirming this issue will be amended on future manufacturing presses but the only way you'll know this is by looking at the details in print on the reverse of the sleeve; as you're probably going to buy this through Amazon, I imagine it's going to therefore be difficult to establish which version you'll ultimately receive?    I've personally re-ordered the DVD from it's native Sweden as I believe that the English subtitles on their own domestic release are the original same as those shown in theatres, so fingers crossed for that.    I'm sure Magnet had their reasons for this but it's an appaling treatment of both film and customer, as they will apparently not even be entertaining the concept of an exchange for those who've already purchased. For shame...

B00005T30L|5.0|Well I had heard that this was a good movie.  I saw it for 4.99 and decided to get it.  During the first 10 minutes I was almost sure I wouldn't like it.  It seemed like your average movie made now a days.  After a while though I got drawn in to the story.  It is about two girls who are best friends.  It is the day of their high school graduation.  They are a lot alike.  They are also planning on moving into a place together.  So everything is fine and good.  That is until some things happen that make them realize that they are both different people.  Some of the things are one of the girls can not keep a job.  So she has no money to pay rent.  Also, the same girl starts talking to this guy she meets.  She sees him selling records and finds out he is a neat guy.  Things happen with him and her while her friends has a job and looks for a place to live.  There is a lot more to the movie.  But I'm not one to give away the story.  So, buy it.  You can find it so inexpensive.  I usually sell movies when I am finished watching them.  This one though was so good,  it has found a place in my collection.<br /><br />Also, the soundtrack is really good.  It has some older blues stuff.  So those who pay attention to that sort of thing, or music lovers.  Will enjoy it for that reason as well.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|2009 is shaping up to be one of Bruce's highest-profile years yet, as if he hasn't many yet. In January there was the controversial (and Walmart exclusive) \\"Greatest Hits\\" release (quickly disavowed by the Boss, as if that somehow would negate that the release happened), then in February there was the SuperBowl half-time show, and now a new studio album, only 15 minths after the release of \\"Magic\\".<br /><br />\\"Working On a Dream\\" (13 tracks; 53 min.) starts off disastrously with the 8 min. \\"Outlaw Pete\\" that just goes on and on and on. For me the album really starts with the second track \\"My Lucky Day\\", an irresitable Bruce romper and a great sax solo from Clarence. The title track is a nice sing-along. The middle part of the album is stuffed with shorter songs that generally work very well\\" \\"What Love Can Do\\", \\"This Life\\" (which is reminiscent of Brian Wilson), the raw and bluesey \\"Good Eye\\", and the acoustic, gentle \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", it all flows just great. \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" sounds like another obvious radio single to me. The album closer \\"The Last Carnival\\" is a touching tribute to Dabby Federici. The bonus track is the beautiful title track to \\"The Wrestler\\" movie (a crying shame that this didn't even get nominated for an Oscar).<br /><br />In all, but for the opening track, this album is easy to the ears and plays great as a companion piece to \\"Magic\\" (which in my book is a little better as an album). The Boss is taking to the streets again this summer and in June will play at Bonnaroo for the first time. Can't wait to see that, as I'm sure he'll have something special up his sleeve for that occasion.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this show.  I don't usually get emotinally involved with TV shows to the point that I would watch the episodes multiple times.<br /><br />This show (as with most of Joss Whedon's work) makes you love the people on the show from minute one.  The plot follows a team of rebels throughout space after they fight against the \\"Alliance\\" which has formed between the core planets who have abandoned individuality in order to conform to a uniform society.  The premise is simple, the stories are anything but.  This show is entertaining, exciting, thoughtful, artistic, and any other positive adjective you can think of.<br /><br />I have seen each episode a minimum of 4 times.  I have watched some of my favorites (Our Mrs. Reynolds, Shindig, Out of Gas) many more times.<br /><br />For 20 bucks on Amazon, it is almmost a travesty to not check out this award winning series from television genius Joss Whedon.
B001DWNUCO|1.0|I am no prude but this movie certainly crosses the line Malcolm Mcdowell Helen Mirren, Peter Otoole, John Gielgud, should all be ashamed of themselves for being associated with this production. BE WARNED this movie is VERY PORNOGRAPHIC, if that is what you are looking for,you will not be let down. The movie made me feel dirty for even watching it. As for the BLU RAY transfer I also thought it was not up to par. Obviously I wish I had my money back.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I have been a fan of Firefly the series for a long time.  I bought the DVD of Serenity when it came out, and then upgraded to this disc when it came out.  There is nothing changed in the movie.  There are no added scenes, and this is not a directors cut of the movie or anything.  However, you do get a whole second disc with added features, which include interviews, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and a new commentary track that allows even more insight into the film and the series.<br /><br />I love the show, and I LOVE this movie, so I am a bit biased.  I would say if you don't already own the movie, buy this great set for the added features and packaging.  If you own the DVD, only upgrade if you are geeky enough (like me) to really enjoy the few but quality special features.  One of these days, I may even upgrade to the BluRay, and own this movie three times over.  :)
0486440966|4.0|this was a little heady for me(There were a lot of words I had to look up in the dictionary) but it has an interesting plot.

0143038419|5.0|okay like many things in life, this is not what it seems. It is about a lady who reminded me of Bridget Jones alot trying to fix herself. Her life is a mess, and as part as research for work ,She visits 3 countries in a span of year.She learns to truly relax and eat with passion in Italy. My favorite part in Italy is when she searches for this pizza place in Naples and stands in line for a really long time in the rain and waits for pizza. Also love the Italians passion for soccer.She finds healing and spiritual solace in India along with a fabulouso sarcastic old hippie guy named Richard from Texas, who calls her groceries as a nickname.   And she meets this amazing medicine /artist man in Bali who... that is all I will tell you..   The main character is a little overemotional and clingy at times, and is prone to serious bouts of depression but, I didn't mind. I am a very flawed person myself, and would have been thoroughly bored had the narrator been perfect.   I totally understand arguing with your negative side of your brain and fighting yourself to think positive and stop beating yourself up.   Also, she deals with religion alot, which may scare people off. Please take and read this with a open mind, see how other people worship , pray meditate see life. Yes the spiritual realm, is complicated, but once you start studying in it, I promise you will never be bored .

B000002U9Y|4.0|In 1968, Pink Floyd was still getting its wings as it emerged into the revolutionary and experimental music scene of the late '60's.  Their first album was mildly popular, but did not show their true potential, except for in a few songs like \\"Astronomy Domine\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\".  But with ASoS, we are given the first good Pink Floyd album, a sign of the great LPs the band would create in the next decade or so.    The album kicks off with a throbbing baseline and organ solo into \\"Let There Be More Light\\", a Waters song dealing with the story of an astral traveler journeying through the universe.  We also get the first glimpse of Gilmour's guitar work in his distorted solo.  \\"Remember a Day\\", shows that Wright was also capable of writing decent lyrics.  They evoke reminiscent thoughts of childhood, propelled by Barrett's slide guitar and Wright's piano and airy vocals.  His other composition on the album, \\"See-Saw\\", is very similar, but with an overall darker tone, commenting on the depressing reality of growing up and leaving behind one's childhood.  \\"Corporal Clegg\\" is the first of many songs penned by Waters dealing with the war, but is far more comical, humorously observing the poor treatment of disabled veterans after WWII; it also features a kazoo, which can grate on the nerves after a while, but gives the song a marching, military air.  The closing track and Syd's sole composition, \\"Jugband Blues\\", is probably the most mature song he ever wrote, dealing with the his feelings on being distanced from the band.  It provides a relaxing, yet melancholy end to the album.    Now for the two standout tracks.  The first, my personal favorite, is \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\".  Written by Waters, who based his lyrics on lines from Chinese poetry, it is a very spacey and exotic track, with the organ and guitar merging quite beautifully.  It was far better live, but the studio version is pretty good anyway.  The other piece that truly demonstratesthe band's musical capability is the title track.  To sum it up in only a few words, it is 12-minutes of chaos, with hectic piano and slide guitar, propelled by a repetitive drum line.    Though not nearly their best album, it is certainly the first of their early albums that I, as a HUGE Pink Floyd fan, would recommend listening to.  It's a good transition piece before listening to the really avant-garde \\"Ummagumma\\".  If you're only going to buy a few songs from this CD, I would recommend \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\", and maybe \\"Let There Be More Light\\".  But if you've got the money, I would say just buy the whole album, for it is well worth it.

B000O179FO|5.0|If you lack soul, you won't get this movie.  This movie is for those with a pulse.    Fantastic cinematography.  Fantastic sound.  Fantastic acting.    If you go into this movie with expectations, you will be distracting yourself.  Let it go and allow yourself to get immersed.    I bought this movie and sat on it for months before finally watching it today.    Wow!  I got sad, excited, cried, laughed, relaxed, stood up and clapped in ovation... all in one experience.    The tens of thousands I spent on my movie theater were worth it... just for this movie.  Wow!
B001PPF12Q|5.0|I am reacting to the negative reviews calling for remastering. Be careful what you wish for. 90ies technolgy already was highly advanced and Rhs CDs in general sound very good. You can play them loud and at lower volume and they sound good. I've gone through updating many of my 50-60 jazz CDs and in those cases it is amazing what could be done since they were first thrown on the market in the late 80ies. But what should a remastered Rh Cd sound like? Stronger bass, greater volume at high frequencies? I don't think you'd be looking for that. Thing is, Rh came along when the technology was advanced and they utilized it to their ability and artistic views. I am very pleased with what we have and find these expanded reissues a welcome, albeit costly addition. Yes, money is being made of us, but with these reissues something of value is being offered. And it is up each individual to make his or her mind to go for it. Don't dish this just because you have a hangup.    For anyone liking OK Computer and wondering if the extra CD is worth it: The music collected from contemporary EPs is very good, not quite as great as the original album, but very enjoyable.
159102594X|5.0|The Blade Itself (The First Law: Book One)    It is so good to find books such as this. Joe Abercrombie opens the door to a great adventure here. The thing that got me hooked into this amazing book was the way Mr. Abercrombie manages different plots around the book, that way there is never a center or principal character and all of them gain a certian importance during the story.     There is a dark humor underneath as well, making you smile from time to time. The action scenes are well written with perfect timing and the perfect amount of gore. The dialogues are sharp and not at all confusing or long to make you sleep. Another thing that I really liked about the book was that the magic it´s not overdone and it only appears when necessary.    If you are looking for a \\"literal snack\\" until \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" by Mr. R.R. Martin, then look no further. The Blade Itself Trilogy will fill the gap perfectly.    I looking forward to \\"Best Served Cold\\" the new book from Mr. Abercrombie, I bet it will be a hit.    Cheers!!

0316168815|4.0|I am a high school teacher and I like to read the books I see my students reading as it provides another venue for conversation.  This book was a good read and it is written from the perspective of the deceased who still has the ability to watch her family and friends deal with the tragedy that killed her. Because of the way in which many kids \\"trust\\" too readily (my space, facebook etc) I thought it to be a great conversation starter.     Though written from a teen perspective, I definitely was not bored.
B0010X745K|2.0|This film works best as an unintentional comedy. The people in it are so stupid you need to see it as a comedy, or you'll just be frustrated.    Take for instance when there's people besiged in a grocery store. There's interdimensional mega-insects are being attacted by the light. It's hillarious, as one group go around turning their lights off, another, headed by William Sadler are turning on spotlights, drawing the insects on. In fact everything Sadler does is un-real.    Opening a door to allowing tentacles grabbing a boy, to sitting there stunned as others try to save him. To screaming like a girl when he sees a bug whilst everyone else is trying to be quiet so as not to attract them.    Sadler then suddenly finds religion, following probably the stangest character of them all Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs Carmody.    Mrs Carmody walks around the shop spouting biblical tracts about the end of the world, and what happens? 3/4 of the people in the store believe her and believe that they must sacrifice someone to the mist. That's how unreal it gets.    When the insects get in the people have torches to fight them and almost set their whole building ablaze.    Another hillariously stupid charcter is Andre Braugher as Brent Norton. When people tell him that they have a piece of the tentacle from one of the creatures and they warn him not to leave the store he thinks it's some strange practical joke. Does he go look at the tentacle? No, of course not. That's right, during an emergency, when civil defence sirens are sounding and someone runs into the store with his clothes bloodied and torn, warning others not to go out, because something's in the mist it's a very ellaborate practical joke.

0316067601|3.0|I liked the book's story, just some of Luttrell's writing seemed more suited to a middle school essay than a nationally published auto biography. Also in my opinion he states his political beliefs far too often and in places where they may not be appropriate.
1416562605|4.0|There are some people I know who love to read books about India. The Namesake, Interpreter of Maladies, The God of Small Things, The Inheritance of Loss, A Fine Balance.... I'm not one of them. (Heck, I've never even seen Slumdog Millionaire.)    There are also some people I know who love to read books that win prizes. The Pulitzer Prize, the PEN/Faulkner Award, the Man Booker Prize, the Nobel Prize, a prized spot on the New York Times Best Seller List.... I'm not one of them either.    But, I do like to call myself complicated and I am an entrepreneur. In addition, I'm rather partial to the epistolary style of writing (see: the column \\"Letters to Inspiring Writers.\\")    When I picked up \\"The White Tiger\\" by Aravind Adiga (on the nightstand of someone who does like to read books about India), I was intrigued by the back cover (\\"Balram Halwai is a complicated man. Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer.\\") as well as the style of the book (a series of letters composed over seven nights from the desk of Balram Halwai to the Premier of China). So, I read a few pages and I stole the copy from the nightstand. (\\"borrowed\\" - without asking - though I did return it a week later.)    For those who know about Indian culture, are from India, study India, well, I'm not sure what you would think of this book.    The story is a simple one, told by Balram Halwai, about Balram Halwai. Balram seeks to enlighten the Premier about the underbelly? the reality? of life in India. While Balram exposes his life, he attempts to expose the universal culture? customs? that influence his life. In other words, he directly acknowledges that his story is his own - he is special - he is a \\"white tiger\\" - but his story could be anyone's story - any \\"white tiger's\\" story.    For example, on pages 33-34, this is how Balram describes his picture on his \\"Wanted\\" poster:        Set into the text of the notice, a photograph: blurred, blackened, and smudged by the antique printing press of some police office, and barely recognizable even when it was on the wall of the train station, but now, transferred onto the computer screen, reduced to pixes, just an abstract idea of a man's face: a small creature with large, popped-out eyes and a stubby mustache. He could be half the men in India.    This is the reason that I bring up my naivete and disclaim any thoughts or opinions that an Indiaphile (is that a word?) may have: the story is simple in its telling but complex in what it tells. The nuances are there. However, if you already know the nuances and you prefer or seek to \\"solve\\" these nuances, well, I'm not sure what you would think of this book. All I can say is that Adiga's writing is entertaining. For that reason alone, you may want to read this book.    (As a sidenote, I will bring up that the USA Today quote on the front of my copy states, \\"One of the most powerful books I've read in decades. No hyperbole. This debut novel hit me like a kick to the head - the same effect Richard Wright's Native Son and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man had.\\" I bring that up because it's an analogy I can understand. I can also say that even if one already knows the nuances of racism and prefers or seeks to \\"solve\\" these nuances - there is still much to learn and gain from Native Son and Invisible Man.)    One of my favorite parts of the book is how Balram stereotypes? describes? presents different Indian cities and villages. Bangalore (the Silicon Valley), Laxmangarh (the rural village offering little opportunities for a \\"white tiger\\"), Dhanbad (the industrial city where a \\"white tiger\\" may try to get ahead), Delhi (the big corrupt city), and Gurgaon (the swanky \\"place to live.\\") While the narrator may be anonymous/invisible in Bangalore with his chandelier, his setting is real and alive and can be found on Google Earth!    Adiga, as a writer, has proven he can derive make believe from reality to entertain readers. In addition, he has created an entertaining, easy-to-read novel that unravels into provocative insights about a country, its history, and its social system - whatever the system may be. (\\"I should explain a thing or two about caste. Even Indians get confused about this word, especially educated Indians in the cities. They'll make a mess of explaining it to you.\\" p. 53)    Further reading:  # Book Review in the New York Times  # Aravind Adiga's website
1416955070|3.0|This was a strange one for me. While at first it was hard to keep up with all the different categories of who and what were in the book. (demons shadowhunters,worldlanders and so on) I really could have used a key in the back. But it got easier as the story went on the keep track of what/who the characters in the book were. If was strange for me because while the story was kind of predictable and not really what I would say is very gripping. But for some reason I couldn't stop reading it. (Strange) I really felt like I had to just keep reading even though I wasn't feeling much about the book. So I am kind of undecided about it still. I will read the other two in the series, I feel like I have to. :) And I would recommend this to my friends to read. I am holding out hope for the other stories to give me more.

B000LT2IHI|4.0|My niece actually received this toy for her first birthday and then passed it onto my son recently. My niece loved it and was pleased that she could entertain herslef with it, but it might have been a gift best given a little earlier. My son inherited it at 9 months, which was perfect timing, as he was just starting to pull up. Although one should should stay close to babies at this stage for safety reasons, the giraffe toy was an excellent toy for him to pull up on (recommend the toy be put on carpet at this stage due to baby instability and liklihood of tipping over). There are many different activities that can be done at different stages. It can be a pull up on toy, a button pushing toy, a slide toy in conjuction with the balls, a noise maker toy and eventually a hand-eye coordination toy, although my 10 month old is not quite at that stage yet. Just because I know the ball goes in the giraffe mouth does not mean my baby has the coordination or observational skills to know that, so as long as it amuzes him, it's a wonderful toy, as long as you can stand the single song and two noise function, although that does have an off switch.

B001C48EF6|4.0|The film takes a look at the year leading up to and first few years of Victoria on the throne of England. It shows the struggles, trials and tribulations of being a lonely child growing up under strict rule to being a young queen on the English throne, a queen that would have the longest standing reign in all of British history.  The film also takes us into the life of a married monarch.  A true love story for the ages, the marriage between Victoria, played by Emily Blunt, and Albert, played by Rupert Friend, was arranged prior to their eventual meeting. Their official meeting was scripted, but it was when both dropped the script and began to speak as themselves that the historic romance blossomed.  The film is a wonderful depiction of the early life of the queen, showing how she became one of the greatest monarchs in British history.         Although I am not technically trained as an historian, I am as an actor and director and I found this movie worth its price at the theatre.  Being one of many costume dramas that I have seen The Young Victoria has been by far most sound in design, screen capture, performance, and set. One must remember, though, that this is just a movie and in order for it to be completely historically accurate is reaching for the stars. This film was an interpretation above all; an inside look at the life of a young queen from an unfamiliar angle, her personal life. Though this is not the first film to do so, it is one of a few films that actually shows the passionate, loving and sexually driven young queen; not the prudish, \\"we are not amused\\" old queen we've grown to know.  My rating for this film stands at a strong four star, and it is recommended that if you are able to let go of the idea of being historically accurate and allow yourself to enter the imagination of film makers you will enjoy The Young Victoria.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|There have been enough critiques before mine singing the praises of this dark and wonderful film adaptation.  Others have explained to the griping theater fans why a film cannot follow the same road as a play, just as a film can't completely follow a book.      The comment I wish to make centers on a previous comment that stage fans were complaining that the film had no good singers.  ARE YOU PEOPLE TONE DEAF??  I have long been a fan of Johnny Depp, because he has the sort of wide-ranging voice control I haven't heard since James Earl Jones.  But it was his singing voice that drew me into the theater and held me there, sometimes in tears, torn between recognizing the wrong and seeing everything through the character's eyes, until the very end, and made me go back for more.  I saw it in the theater four times.    Not to leave out the other wrongly maligned songsters. I liked them all, but the one that left me absolutely gob-smacked was Alan Rickman.     I admit, I am already a fan, but when I heard the \\"Pretty Women\\" duet between Rickman and Depp, my \\"untrained\\" ear heard a marvelous blending of dark and light, between Depp's building rage and Rickman's lighthearted song about being in love/lust with his ward. The epitome of evil opining about \\"pretty women, In their gardens, Letter- writing, Flower-picking, Weather-watching. How they make a man sing!\\"  How could you NOT like his voice? Their voices? How lucky Tim Burton is to have such versatile performances in his resume.  If these kind of performers are not \\"good singers,\\" I suggest the complainers spend less time at operas and more time at movies. Only a long-experienced professional singer could match these folks; but then, THEY probably couldn't act.

0743270754|5.0|It has taken me two months to read this book. In between work, travel, and family responsibilities, I returned to it again and again with the greatest of pleasure. Its length was its strength for me as well as its weakness. The wonder of its depth and length brought me comfortably and reliably into the world of the 19th century, the aspirations of talented men and women, and their new air of freedom to accomplish anything as America spread west and opened what seemed limitless opportunities. And this work generously provided me with the vital dynamics of a young but divided nation. And now, as I've completed it, I see it was too short. I want more of Lincoln, of Seward, of Stanton, of Blair, of Bates, and even of Salmon Chase. I want to feel the words, jokes, compassion, and wisdom of the prarie lawyer who fathered his cabinet and saved our nation's original principles from destruction. I want to be charmed by and learn from the brilliant and sophisticated William H. Seward. I want to know more of Edwin Stanton, the passionate War Secretary who learned to love Lincoln, as all his cabinet members did over time.<br /><br />I suppose this book is not for the professional historian and elitist academic know-it-alls. But what a service Doris Kearns Goodwin has performed for the rest of us, igniting our passion for this vital period of our national life. Her writing is wonderfully clear and readable. She picks the right details and sends us on our way. Goodwin has taken a unique turn in focusing exclusively on the lives of the leading men of Lincoln's time and how he drew his political rivals to his side, even though the man everyone expected to be president in 1860 was Seward. In his ever-present wisdom and humility, Lincoln knew he needed these men to complete his task of bringing the nation together. Again and again, we are shown how Lincoln, and only Lincoln, had the thoughtfulness, skill, empathy, and wisdom to understand the issues of his time and lead the way toward unity, preservation of the nation, and eradication of slavery. He held fast to his decisions, demonstrated tremendous moral authority in the face of huge pressures to relent, and in the end, earned his place as one of the greatest humanitarians the world has ever known.<br /><br />And of course, the election of Barack Obama to the highest office in the land boldly punctuates every sentence in this story and adds to its deeply felt emotional undercurrents. I highly recommend making the time to read this work. It's much better than fiction, TV shows, the movies, or YouTube!, preservation of the nation, and eradication of slavery.

B000Y7U98C|5.0|_Sunshine_ was a very well made science fiction film, one that had some excellent special effects. The basic premise is that in the future, the mid 21st century, our Sun is dying and unless something is done, humanity and perhaps all life on Earth will perish. A daring, bold plan is launched, a scheme to reignite the Sun with a huge bomb basically, flown to its target by a crewed spaceship protected by a massive shield. The ship is called the _Icarus_.      Unfortunately, something happened to the _Icarus_ as it not only failed in its mission but it was never heard from again. The Earth has one more chance, mining all the fissile materials left in the world and sending them with _Icarus II_ . If this mission fails, the Earth is likely doomed. The movie focuses on the ship and crew of _Icarus II_.     _Sunshine_ reminded me of several other films or perhaps styles of film making. I have seen other reviewers call the film pensive sometimes, and with this I agree. There were many scenes of the various crew members (including Cillian Murphy from _Batman Begins_ and _28 Days Later_ and Michelle Yeoh of martial arts fame) quietly mediating, contemplating reality, their life, composing somewhat sad and very thoughtful video messages for people back home, wistfully experiencing brief scenes of life back on Earth in a holodeck of sorts, or looking and getting lost in heavily filtered images of the increasingly large Sun, a huge disc that appears many, many times the size of our star as seen in the skies of Earth. With the long, empty corridors, the quiet hum of the ship's machinery, the dark, gray, or white colors of most of the ship, the half-spoken conversations people have at times, perhaps indicating crew members long familiar with one another and all that they might say, or perhaps indicating depression, an unspoken thought that we are all doomed, the movie had a kind of _2001_  or _Solaris_ feel to it. This isn't a space movie where people are cheering or gambling orcarousing, it is a film in which the crew members of the ship, though they have their angers and their fears (one character says every dream she ever has, as soon as she closes her eyes, is of the surface of the Sun), for the most part are grimly going about their task, all along the way basically saying goodbye to life and remembering what was.     With the very well done but dark and foreboding shots of _Icarus II_ in space and the film's quiet but moody music, _Sunshine_ had a building horror vibe to it, a sense of coming doom, not the doom of a suicide mission, but the doom of the inescapable feeling that something is going to go very wrong, a strong sense of the classic \\"I got a bad feeling about this.\\" The filmmakers did a skillful job of showing how scary space can be...the endless dark, far from home, having to rely on equipment that could break down at any time and kill you in seconds, of being stuck with crew members that may go crazy in the long, long darkness...very well done.     I don't wish to spoil the film, but later on other aspects reminded me a lot of _Event Horizon_. I know there are a number of people who didn't like that film (I think I am one of the relatively few exceptions) but to me part of the movie was a lot like that, a ghost story in space (though done even better than in _Event Horizon_). Going back to my earlier point, the filmmakers did a good job of populating deep space with scary (though realistic) things.      An enjoyable movie, the movie also had some good action sequences and a satisfying ending. I don't think this movie got near the publicity it deserved when it was on the big screen and it is truly one of the better efforts in science fiction film making in recent years, a vivid and stark contrast to some of the incredibly fast-paced, explosion-loving, frenetic, visually overloaded films coming out of Hollywood in the last five or six years.

0930289234|3.0|A good read, but hardly the masterpiece that it's hyped to be.  (Time Magazine lists this as one of the 100 best novels, which is probably true if you haven't read many novels.  It's far better than John Grisham, but hardly in the top 100).<br /><br />The milieu and the plot are damned clever, and the tortured character of Rorshach is a great one.  Unfortunately, those aren't enough to support the leaden dialogue and the tendency to remind the reader that this is a Very, Very Important Book with Big Themes.<br /><br />Apart from Rorshach, the only character that really comes through is that of the creator, Alan Moore.  I'd hate to attend a party with him -- he seems to be a rather pretentious, grim bloke who wants to prove that he's the smartest guy in the room.<br /><br />Also, while this stands head and shoulders above most American comics (especially anything else DC was publishing at the time), I had a lot of trouble seeing what was so revolutionary about it.  It's not the only example of dense, multilayered storytelling from the time (though I will admit it took it to a higher degree), and the techniques, while unfamiliar to comic book readers, had long been used in film and literature.<br /><br />My advice to potential readers:  Borrow a copy from a friend...then shell out the money for your own copy if you really like it.

The author reveals how the brain is not hard wired and written in stone, but has the capacity to be flexible and to interact with, change with the environmental pressure it finds itself subjected too!    It reveals the fact that the brain is a GREAT INTERPRETOR of inflowing data, and the interpretation of that data, may NOT be as things really are, but just gives a semblance of that perception!    It also reveals how we have not even scratched the surface of the potential of what functions the brain, in connection with a body, is capable of performing!!!
1401219268|5.0|I have been a fan of Alan Moore's Watchmen for many years now.  It speaks to the human condition on so many levels, while also being exciting and unpredictable.  What I love about Moore's graphic novel form is that the pictures do not take away from the story and the reader's use of imagination; rather, they add to it and the story would not be as fascinating without them.  In any case, buying the hardcover version directly from Amazon was a great idea because I received my copy very fast and in perfect contition.  I would recommend both this book and this distributor to most people.

His lyrics, instrumental arrangements and use of his vocal range are unreal, and then combine that with catchy choruses and beautiful melodies, and you have some of Jason's best music he's ever done.  I'm a HUGE Mraz fan!  He totally should have won best song of the year and best album of the year, as far as I'm concerned! :-)

B001NFNFIK|4.0|Why didn't someone think of this sooner?  Tommy is perfect to play New Iberia's finest and he delivers a sensational performance, perfectly capturing the character's Louisiana lilt.  Others roles are just as well cast.  Steenburgen is a terrific fit for Dave's wife.  Fans of the books will see all the settings of the novels nicely realized as well, in a production that teams with local flavor and features a top-notch score.  The picture does meander a bit and like the book the sub-plot with the spoiled Hollywood star doesn't work all that well, even though he's played by Peter Saarsgard.<br /><br />Not sure why this went straight to video as it's very solid- a must for James Lee Burke fans.  I'll definitely check it out if Tommy does another.
0671042858|5.0|I've long been fascinated by Stephen King's incredible productivity as well as his remarkable recovery after his tragic accident. I'd never read any of his novels b/c, quite simply, I'm a fraidy cat. I examined the book at the Hatboro (PA) Library and pronounced it suitable for evening reading. No way was I opening myself up to being terrorized.<br /><br />Because the main character is a nine-year-old girl I wondered as I began to read it, should this have been a Young Adult book? No matter, I kept turning the pages and was pulled in slowly, just as Trisha, the main character was slowly pulled in to her saga of being lost in the woods. She and her family had gone walking on the Appalachian Trail in their home-state of Maine.<br /><br />Like all good mysteries of regrettable circumstances, we keep rooting for Trisha to \\"stay on the trail, keep your bearings, do not get lost,\\" but of course that's what the book is all about:  that terrible feeling of being lost anywhere, this time in a huge forest primeval.<br /><br />The amazing thing King does is keeps us riveted even though the only action we see is Trisha walking thru the forest. How, I wondered, can the author so skillfully pull this off, so that we don't wanna miss one \\"hollow hammering of a woodpecker and the harsh cawing cry of the crows; the creaky-door sound of the crickets as the day began to darken.\\"<br /><br />King shows off his masterful story-telling in this 1999 tale as simple as a girl being lost in the woods. He skillfully interweaves then-superb Boston Red Sox relief pitcher Joe Gordon as the spirit that keeps our heroine going in her truly death-defying trek through the forest. We learn how ordinary people, like this nine year-old girl, muster their will to survive using everything in their repertoire and then some.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone, including nine-year-old girls. Your emotions will get a good work-out in this book, especially, yes, a feeling of terror which runs like a softly babbling brook throughout.
B00005JPUN|5.0|I absolutely love this movie :) If you like intense movies I think you'll enjoy this one. Nicole Kidman is always great, and this movie helps to prove that. If you liked I am Legend, The mist, or the others you will probably like this one!
B000002JSN|2.0|Too many pointless and BORING \\"hard rocking\\" riffs here: Wanton Song, Trampled, Houses, Sick again. It's a shame because I thought the album started out so well. These are the six songs I'd keep, though Seaside gets old quick.     1. Led Zeppelin - Custard Pie   2. Led Zeppelin - The Rover   3. Led Zeppelin - In My Time Of Dying   4. Led Zeppelin - Kashmir   5. Led Zeppelin - Down By The Seaside   6. Led Zeppelin - Ten Years Gone     In the light - I'd skip this and play Kashmir. Mystical but manages to be a better song.   Boogie with Stu - I'm more tempted to trap Stu's or actually Plants head in a door frame repeatedly.   Bron - pretty melody actually. I would have kept this except it's not good enough to hold my interest after numerous listens.   Black country - everything horrible about Plant is here - the best example of his irritating vocal style. Not to mention his consistently awful lyrics.     I'm sick of hearing about this band and their importance, Zep can f right off, the aceholes. Rip-off merchants.
B000803CQG|5.0|can't get enough of Zeppelin.  the bluesy rock style is uncomparable.  The original and inventive talent of Jimmy Page, the raw unmatched vocals of Robert Plant, the hard pulsing beats of John Bonham, and the filling in the cake is John Paul Jones on bass and keyboards has not and can not be duplicated.  There will never be another Led Zepplin.  They are LEGEND!!
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Considering the critical reverence visited on each new Clint Eastwood film, it's odd how underrated this powerful film was.  A.O. Scott's review in The New York Times was particularly irksome, as it seemed more a review of Angelina's likely Oscar campaign than the film itself.  Perhaps the way this movie was advertised may have gotten people thinking it was Jolie giving an acting showcase in some modern day \\"woman's picture\\".  But, I'd liken this movie more to pictures like L.A. Confidential and Zodiac than to some kind of big screen Lifetime movie.  And I'd rate the movie higher than both Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River, both fine films.  But I couldn't stop thinking about this film for days after seeing it.  It's Eastwood's most emotionally powerful film.<br /><br />Jolie is sensational in the lead, and I hate the notion that this is just some canned Oscar-bait.  Again, the ads made it look like she has these big \\"acting\\" outbursts.  In fact there's only two such moments, and they're so powerful when you know who she's shouting at.  She creates a heroic portrait of an independent woman of the period and she's not at all anachronistic.  Her hands flutter around her face, not as some histrionic mannerism, but because her character's struggling with her reticence amidst her nightmarish situation and her position in society in general.<br /><br />The film has an outstanding cast.  Jeffrey Donovan from Burn Notice and John Malkovich are both superb.  There are two actors I was unfamiliar with who play cop and killer and this film should propel them into major roles, they're both extraordinary.  There's also especially good work from the young boys in the cast.<br /><br />Also, social conservatives who always bash Hollywood, should take note of the film offering a heroic portrait of an American religious leader with Malkovich's role.<br /><br />I blanched at the running time on this, but it never lags.  It's hard to call something this disturbing \\"entertaining\\" but it is wholly satisfying.
0920668372|5.0|To read this book too literally is to do it an injustice. Some people have told me that the mother in this book is too protective, checks up on her son too much, etc. But read this to a child, even a very young child, and they understand that much of the description in this book is mythical, allegorical - all but the deep, enduring love of mother and child.<br /><br />As more and more mothers live longer lives and as some of them succumb to disease and require caretaking by THEIR childen in later years, I think this book has special relevance. It has always been a family favorite, speaking not just of loving someone but of the importance of liking them as well - and how the two things can be distinct, especially when a child is going through an annoying phase.<br /><br />The book pulls no punches about that, as I think the cover illustration reveals. Babies can make messes and teenagers can be frustrating. Any sentimentality is balanced by those realities described by the author. This is why I can hardly get to the end of this book without crying. It is about more than \\"love\\" but about the kind of commitment and enduring loyalty that endures when growth, change and aging occur. It is about life cycles.<br /><br />To say the words, Love You Forever, is just one facet of love. The author has revealed what really goes into fulfilling true love. I'd recommend The Velveteen Rabbit or another book which mixes fantasy with profound truths about love. I'm facing the loss of a parent and books like these have been as helpful to me as any I've read about grief and bereavement.

B000TGJ8A8|4.0|Others have provided the story-line.  I took the plunge based on customer reviews and the relatively low price for this Blu-Ray title.  Nicolas Cage's acting style, not to be disparaging ;), fits well in this movie.  The movie is entertaining to those who like action movies that do not follow a linear progression and are not looking for a lot of butt-kicking by the protagonist.  This may be the last movie that Peter Falk (one cameo scene) will appear based on recent news that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and advanced dementia.  I found the movie was more entertaining upon a second viewing- many of the subtle plot elements became more evident.  The video and sound quality were outstanding (Sony 52\\" XBR6 and BDP-550 Blu-Ray player).
0316143472|4.0|I love David Sedaris' self-deprecating humor. I like how his books examine everyday things so closely. This book was not as funny as Me Talk Pretty One Day, but I think there is more to this author than humor.<br /><br />The stories about his vulgar, loud-mouth elderly neighbor and the pedophile next door ask us to think about guilt and social pressure. And as always with Sedaris, I thought about human flaws- we are selfish, we fail, we make mistakes. But we are still worth writing about.

B001PPLJIQ|4.0|The Reader is one of those tricky movies. Its not great, though its not bad, its just...somewhere in the middle. Its that film that does get you to feel emotion but it dosen't stick with you and almost thirty minutes after the film ends, you lose all sense of what the film was trying to achieve. Its as if the film only meets you halfway and not give you the whole juggular that you seek.<br /><br />Michael is young man who, one day on his way home, becomes ill and is tended to by one of the tram conductors named Hanna. The two soon begin a passionate affair that last for one summer until she leaves mysteriously. Years later, as a law student, he encounters her again, this time on trial for crimes she commited when she was an officer at a Nazi concentration camp.<br /><br />As mentioned, the film is beautifully shot and each actor is good in their respected role, with David Kross and Ralph Fiennes acting as the young and old Michael and of course the always great Kate Winslet as Hanna. However, as much as I love Kate, I didn't think this film was 'Oscar material'. For me, she gave a better performance in Revolutionary Road and the only reason she won the award not for the performance but as a lifetime achievement award for all the times she was shafted by the Acadamy (she should have won for her role in Titanic).<br /><br />However, thats about where the positives end. I'm still not sure what exactly happen when translating the book to film version but it just did not do well. The entire film has this very cold feeling, as if it dosen't want you to feel too much and try as hard as the actors will, they also give off this feeling of coldness.<br /><br />As for all those Oscar noms this film picked up, it basically boils down to three things. 1. Pedigree (both Anthony Mingella and Sydney Pollack produced the film). 2. Material (its a Holocaust film, thats like Oscar gold!) and then 3. Kate Winslet (she is such Oscar bait that she is a force all her own).<br /><br />While The Reader strives to be great, it ultimatly falls short in many aspects. However, that may not be the case for me, others may love this film and think it is absolutly stunning, its just one of those films that shifts depending on the viewer. So heres my advice, if you are into the awards movies, The Reader is a must, but other then that, the film has little else to offer.imatly falls short in many aspects.

B001R4MEYS|5.0|I, like many, wasn't sure what to expect from \\"Crack the Skye.\\" Early reports described it as \\"spacey\\" and \\"creepy,\\" with a classic rock feel, and the introduction of mainstream producer Brendan O'Brien raised further questions about the sound. Having heard the album, I can say that the change is fundamental: \\"Crack the Skye\\" is a metallic prog album, whereas Mastodon had previously been a metal band first and foremost, though one with progressive and technical tendencies. Fortunately, the album is not entirely lacking in the old Mastodon feel, with guitarwork and drumming that should be easily recognizable for any serious fan. The basic songwriting, however, is radically different. Whereas earlier works were primarily horizontal, emphasizing the progression through various sections, \\"Crack the Skye\\" is much more spacious and vertical, with densely layered arrangements of guitars (sludgy power chords, acoustic arpeggios, frantic leads often all at once) atop synths and unconventional percussion to aid the conventional rhythm section. Perhaps most significantly, the vox, originally barked and howled, are now almost entirely ethereal, gliding melodies at the center of the instrumental maelstrom. The feel is finally different: while \\"Blood Mountain\\" and \\"Remission\\" charged over the listener, \\"Crack the Skye\\" engulfs him. Because of this, nothing on \\"Crack the Skye\\" has the sheer visceral power of \\"Workhorse,\\" \\"Blood and Thunder\\" or \\"Capillarian Crest,\\" and those, like myself, who are primarily metal fans may not find the change totally ideal. Personally, though I can't permanently rank it after only 15 or so listens, I seriously doubt I will ever like \\"Crack the Skye\\" as much as I do their previous three albums. This, however, speaks more to the excellence of those albums than to any weakness on this album's part. On one level, this makes \\"Crack the Skye\\" even more impressive: while Mastodon have deemphasized much of what drew me to them initially, they've still crafted a terrific album that is sure to be amongst the year's best, and which further secures their position as the metal band of the 00s.<br /><br />All that said, I was not overly impressed on my initial listen. This isn't surprising, as any dense album requires many listens to appreciate, but the relative weakness of the opening tracks is also a cause. \\"Oblivion\\" and \\"Divinations\\" are the most straight forward songs found here, making them both accessible and not particular striking. They're solid, enjoyable songs, but, in spite of the elaborate production, amount to little more than an extended intro, a few riffs and vocal lines followed by a lead break. It's always wise to include a relatively straightforward track or two on a dense album like this, but they aren't as either ferocious or catchy as they ought to be. Here the more layered, less bruising production holds the album back, but the only other option would be to make these songs sound radically different from the others, an unwise stylistic choice.<br /><br />Fortunately, from \\"Quintessence\\" on the album is terrific. Here the dynamic range is opened dramatically, with quick alterations between spidery licks, ghostly acoustics, and knotty, pounding riffage. Even better is \\"Ghost of Karelia,\\" which ratchets up the eerie  eastern feel and  adds rapid-fire time changes, while the title track creates a droning space-sludge atmosphere where the simple vocal melodies and piercing leads occasionally rise above the mass of sound. None of these three songs was especially striking initially, partially because they are so organically structured, but after a few listens the plain melodies insinuated themselves, and the dense arrangements are more fully revealed. These are great songs, and I've no doubt I'll come to like them more.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the epics are actually the most immediately memorable songs. They are quite distinct: \\"The Czar\\" is probably my favorite track, with repetitive, instantly memorable vocal melodies paired with a driving, groovy middle break. Conversely, \\"The Last Baron\\" is the most conventionally Mastodon-style track despite the extreme length, with a brutally intense tech-metal middle break that reminds greatly of \\"Blood Mountain\\" and is highlighted by Dailor's frenetic, fill-heavy drumming. (Which, somewhat sadly, is generally deemphasized here.) These tracks draw attention to themselves in a way that the others do not, but not so much that they seem out of place. They are meant to be the centerpieces of the album, and fulfill this role beautifully.<br /><br />As good as the individual tracks are, \\"Crack the Skye\\" is better than the sum of its parts, largely because it is a concept album, which naturally seem more grandiose than conventional works when executed properly. The plot, a rather peculiar tale of astral projection, occult rituals and WWI-era Russia, doesn't interest me much (though at least it isn't so stupid as to detract from the album [Operation: Mindcrime, anyone?]), but it does manage a level of unity rare in the genre, and lacks the fat and senseless pyrotechnics that mar many prog metal albums. \\"Crack the Skye\\" is a concept album, but it never feels as though it has artificially been transformed into one, if you catch my meaning.<br /><br />I will be curious to see where Mastodon go from here.

Conversely, \\"The Last Baron\\" is the most conventionally Mastodon-style track despite the extreme length, with a brutally intense tech-metal middle break that reminds greatly of \\"Blood Mountain\\" and is highlighted by Dailor's frenetic, fill-heavy drumming. (Which, somewhat sadly, is generally deemphasized here.) These tracks draw attention to themselves in a way that the others do not, but not so much that they seem out of place. They are meant to be the centerpieces of the album, and fulfill this role beautifully.    As good as the individual tracks are, \\"Crack the Skye\\" is better than the sum of its parts, largely because it is a concept album, which naturally seem more grandiose than conventional works when executed properly. The plot, a rather peculiar tale of astral projection, occult rituals and WWI-era Russia, doesn't interest me much (though at least it isn't so stupid as to detract from the album [Operation: Mindcrime, anyone?]), but it does manage a level of unity rare in the genre, and lacks the fat and senseless pyrotechnics that mar many prog metal albums. \\"Crack the Skye\\" is a concept album, but it never feels as though it has artificially been transformed into one, if you catch my meaning.     I will be curious to see where Mastodon go from here. They've already achieved a level of popularity far higher than I would've thought possible when I first heard \\"Remission,\\" and considering the surprising resurgence in prog, Mastodon may continue to rise.

B001O2ZW1A|4.0|I discovered Porcupine Tree about 6 months ago, thanks to Amazon's recommendation and have since purchased the entire catalog on CD. Being an audiophile I was amazed at the sound quality of the 5.1 mixes on the later CDs as well as the overall quality of the earlier works. In fact Robert Fripp is so impressed with Steven's work that he is using him to remix the King Crimson Catalog in 5.1.         Insurgentes is another example of his fine work as a multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter and producer. Each listen reveals his artistry in form, atmosphere and texture. This guy must live in the studio!        I have only one problem.....I can't access the bonus tracks. Can anyone clue me in.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Opening scene: there he is, on his bed, presenting as pale (nearly nude) sacrifice to Nemesis-- the nasty tormenting teenage boys he must daily encounter  at school.    Why is he (Oskar, well played by young Kare Hedebrant) a victim?  The usual reason in such contexts: he is different from the herd.  He reads--all sorts of esoteric stuff.  He is intelligent.  He is alone. . without allies or companionship or, even, familial support (his parents appear to be indifferent). Thus a natural victim, awaiting destruction.  In addition, his nose runs constantly.  His tormentors call him \\"pig.\\"    Why is this pattern \\"olde wine?\\"  Because while it does not replicate it resonates with many features of Norse and Anglo-Saxon myths of heroes and \\"dragons of chaos.\\"    Set in the cold darkening of a Stockholm winter, Oskar can find no warmth, or strength, either inside or out.  Until the appearance of a girl,   Eli, well played by Lina Leandersson.    She is, or will become, in a sense, his \\"white knight,\\" his \\"salvation,\\" his \\"right one,\\"and eventually his raison d'etre. . .and they will, yes, go off into the sunset together.    No, this not another trite teen romance.  For the girl is a vampire.  And no, this is not another vampire romance (\\"oh I just love your overbite\\").    What renders this relation anything but trite, and anything but a blood-sucking addict/victim symbiosis, are ancient warrior values: loyalty, courage, and revenge.  Yes, revenge.        Forget about \\"New Testament\\" notions of forgiveness; of \\"turn the other cheek\\"; of \\"love your enemy\\" and so on and so forth.  This story is about tearing to pieces the enemy that would destroy you. About never quitting the field until he, or they, are in bloody pieces.  And about unfailing, unflagging dedication to your comrades--or comrade, in this instance, \\"the right one\\" you have let into your life.     Thus, the ancient warrior ethic in a modern film of remarkably brilliant conception and execution. No American \\"studio\\" or production outfit could possibly have made it.  They would have spent tons of money and made lots of noise, gunfire and explosions and grunting and groaning.  This is a film of silences, like a Bergman film, meaningful and reflective of what lies beneath the surface of a life--or in Eli's case, a death.    (The dubbing and subtitles are, indeed, horrible--but apparently the price to be paid for this excellent film.  Shameful ruination of perfection.)
0765348780|3.0|The first book in the sprawling Malazan series introduces us to a mulititude (too many?) of characters, locations, gods, magics, etc.  Take your time with this one (not that you have a choice) as the rather disjointed \\"plot\\" can be trying on even the most diligent of readers. I originally read this when it was first released and had to go back for second helpings once the other books began showing up to reacquaint myself with the characters and whatnot.  However, having just finished House of Chains (the fourth and best book thus far), I can only say perseverance will be rewarded. The ever-present gods, semi-gods, and all-powerful characters can be trying at times and much is left to the reader to \\"fill in the blanks,\\" so to speak, but in the end Malazan comes thru as seemingly insignificant characters/situations/etc reveal themselves eventually (just not in this book!).  All in all a fine beginning to what is becoming a benchmark series, IMHO.<br />One final point, if you're like me, you're going to need all the previous copies of the series available as you continue reading the books because I find myself referring back to previous volumes quite often.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I hadn't heard great things about this movie, but when I finally caught it on HBO, I thought... this movie is really cute, I wonder why it didn't get better reviews.  One night, I watched it again a second time and thought... this movie is really good.  And so, I bought the DVD.  Well, I've watched this movie at least half a dozen times since then and it never loses a beat, if anything, you catch more and more of the little bits that are really funny with each viewing.  Harry Connick, Jr. is adorable as the 'wants to be more than a friend' character and both Gina Gershon and Lisa Kudrow play off each other very well.  Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler had terrific chemisty (even though his role is played mostly in 'flashback' sequences...)  The scenery in Ireland is just beautiful and the lack of needing any foul language or gratuitous nudity or sex to make the movie interesting and funny is very refreshing.  Yes, it may be considered a 'chick flick', but I think anyone who needs a good laugh especially when life kicks you around a bit should buy this movie.
B001QB9H10|1.0|This was the worst movie ever and this is coming from a person that loved the first two movies. Terrible acting, boring as hell!!!  See for yourself and you will understand, I will never watch it again.
B001N26GFM|5.0|Watch this movie; perhaps then when you feel hatred...  hatred for those you don't know...  hatred for those you have not even met...  hatred for those who seem so different...  Then perhaps you will remember this film and rethink things a bit more carefully.
B00069FLC2|5.0|[[ASIN:B00069FLC2 Shadows - The Final Tour]]  Great performance by The Shadows.  Age has not eroded their musical quality.  It's so wonderful to watch these guys again, at their age, performing Live their original Hits.  Brings back fond memories of good old days.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|If I was a man with regular-sized man fingers, this would be the perfect gameboard for me. Instead, I'm a woman with womanly fingers, and the design of this gameboard makes it difficult for me to comfortably use it as it was designed. I find myself having to rest bottom of the palm of my hand atop the part where I should be nestling my palm in order to access the uppermost keys. This can make long periods of play somewhat uncomfortable if I choose to use those keys.    Additionally, this gameboard is only for right-handed users if you choose to use the thumb joystick (which I actually do like, by the way). Thankfully, I am right-handed, but I can see a left-handed person being off put by the inability to change the location of the joystick.    The display is quite nice. You can have your email checked, and your favorite RSS feeds displayed. At the same time, you can check the performance of your PC (extremely useful during hard core FPS sessions), and have a timer as well. I find this feature to be a bonus.    The gameboard software is supposed to come with a number of inherent game presets, however, I found a number of the games I already have installed were not automatically found, such as Warhammer Online. Regardless, I found it much more intuitive if I created my own presets for the games I play, such as Civilization 4 and World of Warcraft. This way I could determine what keys I wanted to use and learn them much more quickly.    Assigning keys to various programs was a snap. Simply click and assign. But make sure that you have selected the application you're using so that the keys work when you're playing the game. Otherwise you'll have to go an change it while playing, which isn't a big thing because it does a live swap and you don't have to restart any clients.

B0019T9FL6|3.0|So we *finally* have Jennifer Hudson's debut CD, a mere 4 (5?) years after her stint on American Idol.  If her time on that show didn't convince people she could sing, then her Oscar winning turn in \\"Dreamgirls\\" certainly did.  Which is probably one of the worst things that could have happened to her, career-wise.    By virtue of being so phenomenal in \\"Dreamgirls,\\" Jennifer Hudson really raised expectations for her debut album, and the delay in its release only increased the hype.  Which makes it all the more disappointing that her self-titled debut is merely serviceable.  Hudson deserves better than the generic and occasionally over-produced tracks on this CD.      Although it falls strictly in the hip-hop/R&B category, this CD is noticeable for its lack of cohesion.  Her ill-advised collaborations with rappers Ludacris (the ridiculous-sounding \\"Pocketbook\\") and T-Pain (the oversynthesized \\"What's Wrong\\") don't seem to belong on the same disc as power ballads like \\"Can't Stop the Rain.\\"  The inclusion of \\"And I'm Telling You\\" from \\"Dreamgirls\\" is puzzling, as it musically doesn't gel with any of the other tracks on the disc, and most fans probably already have a recording of it somewhere in their collections.  And that song is immediately followed by a full-on spiritual, creating even more musical confusion.    However, despite this, it is clear that Hudson herself is a talent to be reckoned with.  Her voice sounds great on every single track, and when she is given the right material, her range and power are awe-inspiring.  Lead single \\"Spotlight\\" is catchy and manages to showcase Hudson's voice without seeming overblown.  The highlight of the CD is a soaring duet with Fantasia entitled \\"I'm His Only Woman,\\" which showcases the range, power, and emotion in both singers' voices.    Although I don't agree with her Grammy win for such a mediocre offering, hopefully it will ensure a second album from Ms. Hudson.  Because I believe that with more focus and the right songs, Jennifer Hudson has the potential to be a huge force in modern R&B.
B000V9KFLY|4.0|We bought this CD for my 8 year old daughter who loves Celine Dion's version of Brahm's Lullaby.  She didn't care much for anything else on there, but we do like some of the songs on this holiday CD.
B000002U82|5.0|Truly great artists create albums that have something to offer new.  It's the kind of bands that reward every album you pay.  Pink Floyd is one of those bands, and that's why Dark Side of The Moon is really one of the best albums ever created, especially by Pink Floyd.  Popularity may convince hardcore fans otherwise, but there really is no , it's simply if you like the music more.  If you like the unique music on Dark Side Of The Moon, I will be certain no other album could touch it.    And untouchable it is!  Dark Side of The moon is such a great album. it makes you think, with it's still-relevant concepts about death, time travel, time, insanity, and birth flooding the landscape.  The lyrics also match the music perfectly.  The music on here takes it's time, but is never boring or dragging, they compose that well.  They are compose so well is simply just fills the air with space.  The word space here is key, as space in the music both makes it relaxing and gives breathing remove, and at the same time feels like something from another world.   It's colorful, black, and just as stimulating as the cover art is.    One thing I would like to stress:  This isn't the only thing Pink Floyd has to offer.   Truth to be told, I think that this album is not overrated one bit, and it is glad to see other kids my age also into this album.  But this hardly is their only album, and I sometimes get sad at the notion that other kids buy this album, get the t-shirt, and forget about everything else Pink Floyd ever did.   Once you get into this album, see just how much more Pink Floyd has to offer.  Try Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Piper At The Gates of Dawn, and The Wall.  Trust us, we know better, and we know how diverse and great this band is, because they gave us a smorgasbord of a discography.
0143038419|3.0|I avoid how to improve your psyche books, but Gilbert's wit and honesty won me to complete her book on getting her mojo back. It had moments of wisdom, not too smarmy. It had some real, funny ,honest sharing. Not a bad read for navel gazing.
B001MYIXAW|1.0|As others have said, this film is great.  Unfortunately, the version as released by Magnolia/Magnet is not true to that seen in US theaters.  For a good side-by-side breakdown of the differences, search for the Icons of Fright website with the title of this film.  I want to give the film five stars, but this version does not deserve it.  For a great film, wait until it includes the original English subtitles on the disc.  The distributor has said that, when released, the version with the theatrical subtitles will say: SUBTITLES: ENGLISH (Theatrical), SPANISH under the technical specs on the outside of the box.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|So I just watched The Brothers Grimm, and I'm really not sure.  There were some parts that were truly wonderful - the cinematography and the costumes were really a visual feast.  And the writing was good.  The thing is, it seemed to me like someone trying to deliver a good joke that just really falls flat.  This movie SHOULD have been awesome.  But the biggest thing to me was that it really didn't know what it was.  Was it funny?  If so, why all the truly scary horror-film moments?  Was it supposed to be a horror film?  If so, why all the light-hearted moments?  My theory was that the Monty Python director wanted it to be funny, and maybe the studios thought that wouldn't sell as much?  So it wound up in the middle.  It seemed to have multiple personality disorder, and two hours is just too little time in which to try to figure out a movie that can't seem to make up its own mind what it wants to be.  Still, like I said, there were many redeeming moments, and if you can deal with not knowing whether a character is supposed to be being funny, and being alternately grossed out and horrified, then go for it.
0199537151|4.0|I just finished reading Frankenstein (first time I've read it). I was surprised that I actually liked it! I imagined it would be dull. The story moved along at a good pace. I especially liked how much emotion was expressed by the characters, and the parallels that can be drawn from Frankenstein's creation that haunts him and things we create in our own lives that may do the same.
0756404746|4.0|A lot of reviewers have commented that for a debut novel this is a truly remarkable read. One can echo that, but one must note a few things also.<br /><br />The story is unfinished and can not stand by itself. It ends with far too many unanswered questions and the answers to those questions, two years later when I read the tale, are still not supplied. This discourtesy ranks up there with George Martin's oversized ego, made larger by a first time writer. Chutzpah is probably what the writer would like to think it is.<br /><br />So we look into character building, the story, world building and see what we find. The world is very carefully constructed, much like a pick up sticks game. Every stick carefully placed and as you lift it you are in wonder that it has fit so well.<br /><br />The magic of the world builds on itself, but as we struggle with it, there are questions that arise and perhaps this is where the rest of the work is delayed. How can we have the evil that the hero wishes to defeat be but a nursery rhyme that those best tasked with facing it, dismiss it as a nursery rhyme. An evil such as this would not leave the knowledge of history.<br /><br />How can the teachers of our hero be so blind that it is our hero who shows them that young people are petty. Did the author not see Goodbye Mr. Chips. Can you live in a world that want's to showcase such an educational venue and be unaware of the place.<br /><br />Our heroine can be only thought of as too fine, too perfect, and how likely is that with the evil that only our hero can see. And the answers are not forthcoming. We have the start of the story, in a book that runs to over 700 pages. Whole tales have been told in half that, and here we have just the beginning? Poor showing.<br /><br />Now will we ever find solace in the end of the tale. One hopes. Until that arrives, better to leave this untouched. Once we have the whole laid before us, we will know if the journey was worth it, or if this author has too much promise and nothing to hold up would could be a house of cards.d be a house of cards.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|'Raw' James Bond movie. Roger Craig is very quick, less dialogue, more action. Special effects were awesome. If you are a James Bond core fan (I am), there is nothing wrong with any Bond's movies. They give you the action, the gizmos, high tech futuristic gadgets, you demand (not a lot on this one, but will do).     If you do not have the right blu-ray equipments, 1080P TV, a good receiver, preferably a high end receiver, speakers and at least 5.1 surround setup, (mine was 7.1), you may not be doing your eyes and ears justice. Blu-ray movie is better than a movie theater any day. Don't spoil your appetite worrying about too many opinions and ratings before the movie, you'll start looking for faults and spoil a wouldhavebeen a great movie. Try it, I did not regret mine. I'm getting my Blu-ray JB collections, naturally. I will watch them again and again, and again ....., you get the picture. Enjoy life!
B001M5UDGS|4.0|Anyone who has enjoyed Joss Whedon's work in the past (Buffy, Angel, Firefly/Serenity, Doll House) is likely to find this DVD delightful. Neil Patrick Harris plays a goofy mad scientist who, in the end, is horrified at what he has done. It starts out low-budget ridiculous and ends up ominous and frightening. It explores human foibles from many aspects, lust for power, loneliness, humiliation, pride, desire to be loved, being foolish, etc. The music and acting in this video is astounding, especially the vocal harmonies. A quite unexpected fantastic bonus of this DVD are a collection of short music videos submitted from other people around the world, which they made apparently inspired by viewing this video online. Their contributions really surprised and impressed me. Don't miss this DVD!
B001R10BM8|5.0|Nice to finally have a Collector's Edition of Never Say Never Again.This is a loose remake of Thunderball,while not being an official part of the Bond franchise,it's enjoyable just the same,nice to see Mr. Connery back as 007 after he left the series in the late 60's! Mr Bean/Blackadder fans,look for Rowan Atkinson in an early role! The Blu Ray transfer and sound are pretty good,also has some great extras as well A+
B001EP8EL2|3.0|Criterion is known for choosing and presenting both classic and \\"challenging\\" art films from across the entire history of the medium. They continue their run with \\"The Man Who Fell To Earth.\\"<br /><br />**********<br />First, let me get the good part out of the way - The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />Criterion has presented the film in a director-approved transfer which very faithfully represents a 1970's film. It is not the sort of slick, whiz-bang HD material you may be accustomed to seeing from modern films. It's grainy. It's a bit soft in detail. But that is the way the film looked, the kind of film stock it used, etc. etc. If you let the transfer work on you, you'll notice the fine detail in things like cloth and facial lines. But the film is limited by its source materials and Criterion has thankfully left well enough alone. Instead of giving us a \\"DNR\\" slathered wax-dummy-festival, they let the film breathe. The same goes for the audio - presented in stereo, not a remastered surround sound track that didn't exist in theaters of the day.<br /><br />Supplements are typically top-notch, as per usual for Criterion. Commentaries, trailers, documentaries, it's a tremendous grab bag of info for fans of this film.<br /><br />******************<br />Now for the bad news:<br /><br />Why would you be a fan of this film? Ugh. It was terminally boring from start to finish. Now let me say - I am a fan of \\"challenging\\" material. I loved \\"2001,\\" I enjoy the films of Todd Solondz, I don't think I am a mouth-breathing action junkie non-sophisticate. But this film is just a mess, especially its interminable, dragging, plodding final act.<br /><br />Some of the performances are interesting, including Bowie's turn as the space man (for better Bowie, check out \\"The Prestige\\"). While Bowie's Tom Newton is easy to forgive if you find little to nothing resembling human motivation, the same can't be said for many of the other actors. About the only other bright spot is a nearly unrecognizable Rip Torn - but even that's a stretch.<br /><br />I applaud experimentation. But it needs some sort of hook, something to maintain a viewer's interest - and this was lacking for me. At first, I thought I might find an interesting social commentary on 1970's America. Then, I thought I might be interested in Bowie's portrayal. But as minute after minute of nothing unspools on the screen, I just found myself checking the time remaining and hoping that something of interest would pop up. Have you ever seen an awful play written by a graduate fresh out of theater school? Have you ever watched a student film? This very ably elicits that feeling in a viewer. I don't think this is quite what director Nicholas Roeg was going for, though...<br /><br />To be fair, Roeg is adept at quick-cut montages which create new, strange emotions in the viewer. Some of the sex-scene montages were interesting. However, his ham-handed handling of the special effects (such as they were) really tore me out of the scene. His inability (or unwillingness) to wring a human performance out of his actors is the gravest sin, though. To further compare it to 2001 - a movie with some wooden performances, to be sure - 2001 had spellbinding effects and one great character in HAL 9000 - enough to make up for its long, indulgent stretches and noodle-scratching logic. In its corner, \\"The Man Who Fell To Earth\\" has pasty naked Bowie.<br /><br />That might be enough for some. But I found it dull, and I wish I had those 2 hours of my life back after having sat through it.<br /><br />***************<br /><br />So let me say it as loudly and clearly as I can - RENT BEFORE YOU BUY! You may be a fan of this film. But you may not. It is, as best I can tell, an extremely divisive piece of work which is usually loved or hated. I don't know that I hated it, but I'm sure glad I didn't pay 25 big ones to own it (I rented it on Netflix).<br /><br />Because I do think it is a vital service that Criterion is providing the public, by presenting challenging art-house fare to the public in faithful, comprehensive editions such as these, I give the whole thing 3 stars. But just as no normal person ought to like everything that's playing at a given theater, no one should assume that every Criterion release is worth the BD-ROM it's pressed upon. Caveat Emptor!s these, I give the whole thing 3 stars. But just as no normal person ought to like everything that's playing at a given theater, no one should assume that every Criterion release is worth the BD-ROM it's pressed upon. Caveat Emptor!
0786838655|3.0|an enjoyable enough read but was pretty disappointed given the hype --it  didn't live up to the potential of the story and could've easily been three times as long, felt like the story unfolded and concluded too quickly -- Harry Potter similarities were way too obvious.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|So far - I've been a big fan of these 40th anniversary remix/remasters.  The sound quality has been Excellent!  It jumps right out at you!  It's cool to hear \\"Light My Fire\\" at it's intended speed,  as they finally fixed it on this release.  Every song on this album is awesome!  The album that took The Doors into super-stardom and launched Jim into rock-icon status!  I highly recommend it to those who haven't discovered the Doors yet or for those who are interested in a better quality sounding Doors debut.  Decent bonus tracks except \\"Indian Summer\\" basically sounds the same as the version on \\"Morrison Hotel\\".  Two takes of \\"Moonlight Dr.\\" are cool to hear.  Long live the Doors!
1594481717|5.0|This book is the best business book I have ever read. As a \\"creative\\" I have always felt a little inferior in the business world but Dan Pink has helped me change all that. I have more confidence and a clearer picture of my future. A Whole New Mind is not just for right brainers but left brainers as well by helping them understand the importance of creativity in their lives.
B001EO748M|5.0|Season 2 is better than season 1, in my opinion. Worth watching. You won't want to take your eyes off of it. A recommendation for any Tudor history buff and scholar, as well as period film lovers. It's nice to see that the show displays characters only known in the history books; for example, Charles Brandon. In all of the movies, PBS specials, and even historical shows, that I have seen, none have displayed Henry's best friend. I think it is awesome, that they are portraying his character. Jonathan Rhys Myers' portrayal of the king, is as well acted along the likes of Richard Burton (Anne of the Thousand Days), and also Ray Winstone (Henry the 8, BBC miniseries).      As with all Tudor movies, plays, and novelizations there are also some minor inaccuracies. But, the program itself, makes up for that. I am highly looking forward to season 3.     I also recommend watching Anne of the Thousand Days, the HBO miniseries Elizabeth 1, Henry the 8th BBC miniseries, and Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett).
B000VZP9G4|4.0|When Kanye first came out, I thought he was ok. Some of his stuff got overplayed and I didn't see why people were making such a big deal out of him. I do think some of the work he's produced has been excellent. And in recent years, he's gotten bigger and bigger. That being said I decided to listen to this, and I thought it was very good. It was intersting how he made people think about how college can effect and the advantages and disadvantages of being a college dropout. That's what I was most impressed with, his ability to really make people think. This is a very fun,but deep album at the same time. My favorite track had to be workout plan. It's almost like an early version of stronger, and the girls talking at the end cracked me up. I also liked We don't care and school spirit. Some of his hit singles were too overplayed for me to give it five stars. Overall, I think he's a good musician and certainly impressed me with this debut. (Warning,it is a very long cd to listen to!)
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|An excellent film. The visuals are stunning and expansive, on par with Baraka.     The story is also very good and interesting. Highly recommended for young, old, and in between.
B00006LLOB|2.0|Amazon's critic, Hal Horowitz, pretty much says it all here. Whether it was Wolf's health or any other set of circumstances, these recording sessions simply never found their groove, and the result is miserable. It seems perverse to use the word \\"boring\\" for an album headlining a performer whose voice alone would wake the dead, and some of the best - and certainly most famous - musicians of the time, but boring it is, at least for the most part. Honestly, I can't quite put my finger on the \\"why\\": everyone plays their best, supporting the big man with respect approaching reverence, but somehow the whole effort just fails to take off. There are a few notable exceptions, and if you program your CD player to play only a few of these numbers at a time, you'll get a glimpse of what the sum of it all could have been. \\"Who's Been Talking\\" works because the rhythm is almost the opposite of blues, bouncy and lilting, it owes more to rock than blues and is a lot of fun. It is undoubtedly endearing to hear the stars of the day buttering up the old man in order to get him to play acoustic guitar along with them on \\"The Red Rooster,\\" even if the studio chatter is more exciting than the song that follows it. \\"Do the Do\\" is fast and tense, and \\"Wang Dang Doodle\\" snakes along at just the right pace, half-lazy and half-stompin'. Unfortunately, the 13 selections on the original issue of the recording were at least three or four too many, several dragging along listlessly, sounding one exactly like the other. It's hard to beieve that the indifferent \\"Sittin' on Top of the World\\" was once Wolf's signature number, and it's also with reluctance that one admits that, un-PC as this may sound, several of the songs were in a way ruined for Wolf by being made famous in blistering interpretations by Cream, Stones, et al. To've augmented this failed project by a whole second CD of rehearsals smells of either despair or overzealousness.

B001GKJ2FC|1.0|This movie was awful. The action sequences seem written by a fifth grader with the imagination which could only come from a boardroom struggling to find a new concept for an action movie. I really have to wonder how the hell this became a major motion picture, did someone owe someone a huge favor? Seriously this movie was obvioulsy written, then plugged with some over-the-top twists. If this movie held your interest then I hope you are under the age of 14, and consequently restricted from seeing anything but the previews. Also the direction and acting were both sub-par, it was a shame to see Morgan Freeman in this feature, he should fire his agent.
1439136653|2.0|This is one of those instances (like Briget Jones' Diary and The Notebook) where the screenwriter and film makers improved upon a book.      Originally titled Q&A, the concept of the book is unique and captivating.  The execution, however, is choppy and puzzling.  The novel read like a group of loosely connected short stories, which made it easy to put down after each chapter.  About three quarters of the way through I decided not to pick it up again.  Don't let this stop you from seeing the movie, though, because it's fantastic.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|My purpose for this review is not to summarize the book, as I feel that a majority of the other reviewers captured the basic plot of this novel very well. Instead I will review what made this novel unique and worthy of your time. The heroine of the novel, Juliet, is adorable and insightful.  As the reader traverses through the pages of this novel, it is easy to be charmed by her spirit and sense of humor, which is quite subtle. For most of the novel, Juliet is helping the reader admire a Guernsey resident, Elizabeth, but by the end of the novel, what the reader realizes is that Elizabeth and Juliet are very similar, and that they both embody strong, brilliantly giving women. While it is a love story, based on two living people, Juliet and Dawsey, it is also a love story surrounding Juliet and all that Elizabeth loved, including her daughter, Kit.
0446581348|1.0|I love reading makeup books, for the tips and the pictures. I have read all of Bobbi Brown's makeup books and I have to say I am thoroughly disappointed. The quality of the makeup and the photos is abysmal. The models have too much blush on that looks splotchy and uneven and too bright, the photos are clearly all retouched within an inch of their life, and there is nothing in this book that she has not already said many times earlier. The portions of the book that dealt with beginning a career in makeup were interesting, but I was really taken aback by the photography and makeup. How on earth could someone polish these in a book!
B001O8C5KK|5.0|The intimacy of Puccini's operas lend themselves well to the likewise intimate trappings of the recording studio.  Indeed, there was once a time when producers in recording companies would commit at least one recording of his operas year after year, exploiting the abundance of voices available during their era to create some of the most memorable recordings that we continue to consider as definitive today.  We are not so lucky today: first because of the exorbitant fees associated with studio products, second because for the preponderance of exquisite Mozart and Handel voices, we all seem to have sacrificed our Puccini and Verdi sopranos, if those terms make any sense at all.      To my recollection, there are three recordings of Madama Butterfly that I absolutely cherish: the Karajan recording with Maria Callas, the Barbirolli recording with the unforgettable Scotto, and the classic Serafin recording with Tebaldi.  Each one of those sopranos had something distinct to say about the work that made it so personal and unforgettable that we at once identify with this geisha whose plights are exposed throughout the entire drama that we are able to sense a development in her character.  Now, with the advent of this Butterfly, I would add Gheorghiu to that list, never mind all the qualms people have about the plausibility of her voice to tackle such a demanding part in the opera house.    What Gheorghiu bequeaths to this quintessential Puccini role is an abundance of color and vocal texture that never escapes her vivid imagination.  From her entrance, her lilting voice creates a silhouette of a sylph-like teenager who comes with all the timid manner of an East Asian girl trying to escape the clutches of her tradition.  One famous phrase that has become a point of comparison, regardless of its brevity, is the way that a Butterfly would utter the phrase \\"morto!\\"  Callas did this with an abundance of candor and poignancy, exposing us to the kaleidoscopically tragic characterof Cio-Cio San.  Gheorghiu does it slightly differently, but with no less impact.  She is capable of turning that phrase into a window that opens into the inner psychology of her soul.  As she engages into the love duet, her beautiful, dusky lyric timbre fits the part of Butterfly like a glove and makes us think really of a fifteen year old rather than a grand priestess of music trying to sound like one.      In Act 2, when she struggles between trying to reveal her son's existence, we are made aware of the dismay that Butterfly has to go through in order to let Sharpless know about the impossibility of the situation.  By the way, her Un Bel Di is absolutely gorgeous.  My favorite moment in the opera, however, is the aria \\"Che tua madre\\", which only in my mind Callas could sing with emotive precision.  Gheorghiu comes close, but she was never really a class A tragedian in the mould of Callas.  When Butterfly realizes that Pinkerton is arriving, she sounds rightfully ecstatic, and upon meeting Kate, we are also made aware of her indecision and her despair.  Her final scene is a tour-de-force, awarding the listener with a compellingly complete portrait of a woman sings with abandon upon realizing the hopelessness of her life.  There is no doubt that Gheorghiu belongs to the pantheon of great singers that include Scotto and Callas, if we were to judge her by this recording alone.       Jonas Kaufmann is glamorous casting for the short yet pivotal character of Pinkerton.  His dark, handsome voice fits the part admirably, and his dramatic acumen is no less capable of producing the kind of effect one would feel from a singer who plumbs the part and sees it as a vehicle for deceit and trickery while infusing it with an amorous ardency.  Kaufmann fits that bill, and is but one of the many singers today equipped with an instrument sizable enough to project a right Puccini-esque amplitude and timbre into the theater.      As Suzuki, Enkelejda Shkosi does not efface such greats like Christa Ludwig or Fiorenza Cossotto who can make magic with this small yet effectively touching role.  If you want to see her as a Brangäne figure, go for Ludwig.  If it is a rich Italianate maid that you want, with meltingly large tones and all, go for Cossotto.  But Shkosi does fine and accompanies Gheorghiu valiantly in the flower duet.  Fabio Capitanucci sounds like a Verdi baritone who walked into the wrong opera.  His large baritone voice has little of the intimacies that make Sharpless human and sympathizing.  Raymond Aceto is a coarse Bonzo, while Gregory Bonfatti sounds more like a Mime who has wandered into Puccini territory.      The largest draw for me in this venture was Pappano's conducting.  Time and time again, Pappano has proven himself as a master of the operatic literature, amazing listeners in his nuanced performances of operas by Massenet, Verdi, Puccini, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Bizet, Strauss, and Mozart.  His conception of this intimate score is no less colored and powerful in its dramatic impact.  He propels not only the drama with his incisive drive, but also with a sense for line that never flags and a clarity that allows a second-rate ensemble like the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia to sound like a gossamer German orchestra, resplendent with Japanizations and all.  Listen to Che tua madre and how he shapes his strings and percussion instruments with the deft manner of a Japanese lady.  Thirty-some years ago, a miracle called James Levine came into the music scene to create some of the most memorable performances of opera ranging from the vast expanse of the literature.  Today, we have Pappano, and dare I say that I find him to be far more inspired that Levine?  Go crucify me, but I think he's brilliant.     EMI's latest Butterfly is packaged luxuriously in a clamshell with libretto and pictures.  By aesthetics factors alone, this package would probably catch your eye.  But judging its artistic merits, however, this reviewer would say that this latest release would most likely become a classic in the future.
0312370849|4.0|I'm not really sure where to start on this one. It was the first book in a number of years that I literally could not put down. I sat for hours & hours reading this book until I finished it. All in all about 6 or 7 hours. The story grabs you & does not let go. I will say this, though. It had a rough start. I felt that the author going from one point of view in the story, Sarah's, to the view of Julia happened too frequently & was just too abrupt. I think more time could have been spent developing one story before switching to the other. It blends nicely towards the 2nd part of the book, though. I'm sure this will be corrected in the editions made for sale, but the advanced copy was riddled with errors that an editor should have picked up. Errors such as \\"fell\\" instead of \\"feel\\" in a sentence. That was mildly annoying, but did not detract from the story. Somehow you are put in the position of feeling what Sarah felt as she was so determined to get back to her brother. The author does well pressing upon you the realistic thinking that her brother likely does not survive, and yet you have hope that somehow somebody got to him. You steel yourself, readying yourself for the worst, and yet there is that hope that perhaps... maybe... I hope... he lives. What's wonderful about the story is that it does not end when we find out what happens to her brother, Michel. There is so much more to the story, a beauty, and yet a sadness to it. Even to the end, up to the last sentence, there is hope for a new beginning. Always there is hope. This was such a beautiful story. The author does a marvelous thing, something so many authors seem unable to do, atleast in my opinion. She puts you in the place of the characters. She effectively draws you into the story so much that you feel what the characters feel. She also teaches you about the history of France during the 2nd world war. It all seems to be woven so seemlessly into the story. I highly recommend this book, and in fact I plan to buy extra copies to give to people.

0061564893|5.0|When I first read the book 1421 several years back, I had some doubts about the historical research, etc...but one week ago, the Princess Taiping  (Peace), a replica of the Chinese junks from the Ming and Qing Dynasties, sailed into Saipan after being at sea for over a year, including the west coast of America and Hawaii.  It is a 54-foot long and 45-foot wide  (sails only - no power) wooden/bamboo junk with the same specs as built over 600 years ago.  The 10-person volunteer crew is a mixed bag of Chinese and Americans, and they are convinced that they have preserved the sailing traditions and proven that the junks could have done what was stated in 1421. From Saipan, they go to Wake Island, then Okinawa, before making its final journey to Taiwan. A wonderful tradition restored and many of us got to tour the junk with Captain Nin-Sheng Liu's permission and graciousness. Bon voyage!
B000002LKF|5.0|Once again I am incensed by the small (yet persistent) minority who fail to 'get' the sheer genius that frankly saturates this album. The South American rhythms are infectious. Having heard (and of course loved) Graceland before buying this one, after about 3 listens it'd clicked - I now consider 'Rhythm' to be the winner by a nose.     The chorus of She Moves On, for example, although essentially very different in style, is melodically a clear match for the beautiful 'Under African Skies' on Graceland. The layering of xylophones (or some similar percussion instrument!) in Can't Run But, I distinctly remember finding breathtaking on my first listen, and it still never fails to impress. (A song that leaves you sort of mesmerized when it's finished, like you've just woken up from a strange dream.) Spirit Voices - frankly left me speechless, and that's not even mentioning the empowering optimism of tracks like Thelma, The Obvious Child, Born At The Right Time, and Cool, Cool River (see Paul Simon's Concert In The Park for the best versions of these latter 2).     Lyrically, Simon is stronger than ever. There's simply not enough space to quote all the gems here, but one particular favorite of mine: \\"I watch you sleeping in the hospital bed / The baby curled up in a ball / Winter sunlight hits the family tree / And everything else becomes nothing at all.\\"  [Thelma]   Four lines is apparently all Mr. Simon needs to describe the indescribable sense of awe and perspective one feels after the birth of their first child! I'm not the sentimental type, but this one struck a chord with me.     And of course:   \\"Down by the riverbank / A blues band arrives / The music suffers / The music business thrives\\" [Can't Run But]  The album is littered with lyrical gems throughout (Cool Cool River also springs to mind just off the top of my head), but as with all great music, these are undoubtedly much better heard in their intended context than simply read.     In terms of the rhythm andinstrumentation, it's overflowing with delicate complexities, many of the tracks strike that extremely rare balance of being potentially either drifted off to or scrutinously analysed by music scholars for years to come.     This is not for the generic 'throwaway' listener; it's a record that rewards commitment. 3 or more play-throughs whilst doing something significant (for me it was my summer paper route when I was 15! A vacation drive'll do just fine though ;) to really take in all that is going on here, and ultimately find a fitting backdrop for what is definitely music for the open air.     Rhythm Of The Saints may have missed out on the 'popular' vote, but it's an invaluable triumph for the exploration of music and artistic integrity. Arguably the best $11 I ever spent and has enriched my life [repeatedly] ever since. Think of the perfect summer album, then go beyond that. This is it.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I was a bit skeptical when I heard about this album, but after hearing a couple songs played live and some interviews with Chis I decided to give it a chance.  And I'm sure glad I did!  This is a perfect synthesis of Timbaland's layered, mostly electronic sound and Chris' soulful voice, great melodies and killer lyrics.  Give this cd a chance and listen with an open mind, you will not be disappointed.
0307269981|4.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire is a brilliant yet often maddening sequel to [[ASIN:0307269752 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.]]  If you haven't read the first book yet, stop right now and order Dragon Tattoo, which introduces the key characters Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist.  Since author Stieg Larsson died, sadly, after writing three books in this series, you should allow yourself the whole experience.<br /><br />As I did with Dragon Tattoo, I picked up The Girl Who Played With Fire without reading the cover blurbs.  I didn't want a road map; I just wanted to jump in.  My critique will not contain many plot details but I do have a definite opinion about what worked well and what dragged the story down.<br /><br />At his kinetic best, Larsson's writing can come across like Agatha Christie meets [[ASIN:0312195265 The Silence of the Lambs.]]  I don't read too many thrillers, but when Salander and Blomkvist get on a tear, Larsson propels his readers into a dark underworld that lies just below the surface of a corrupted civil society.<br /><br />However, Larsson's own journalistic background is on display, to a fault. I appreciate his penchant for social expose, but his style gets in the way of his storytelling.  He populates his story with dense exposition.  No character walks on stage without a thorough background check.  The Girl Who Played With Fire explores sex trafficking, so it's expected that Larsson will tell us a lot about the trade and its many tentacles.  But as the central crime story unfolds, in addition to journalist-hero Blomkvist, we are saddled with a huge cast of investigating detectives and journalists we don't care about that much, and whose Swedish names are hard to keep track of.<br /><br />The long setup almost lost my interest.  By page 120 I was frustrated and thought about putting the book back on the shelf for a while.  The key incident that propels the story occurs almost 200 pages into this 550+ page book.<br /><br />After that, things take off like a rocket, and I read the rest of the book in three long sittings.  Lisbeth Salander is a truly original, complex and ambiguous character.  She's society's wronged outcast come to life with turbo-charged vengeance.  The central mystery of this story seems at first to hinge on too much coincidence, but the tangled web eventually coalesces in a satisfying way.  In Dragon Tattoo, Salander seemed like a stock character, the damaged super-genius, and the sequel both humanizes her and deepens her mystique.<br /><br />Patience is required, but if you can get into it, The Girl Who Played With Fire is an original, intense, and satisfying ride.ad the rest of the book in three long sittings.

Granted, the movie was salve on the wound, but the wound still remains. The only thing that will ever help us heal would be to bring the show back.

B00004XONN|1.0|Really, I don't get Radiohead's appeal. At all.     I don't get why this *WAY* over-hyped mediocre alt-rock rock band from the 90s can incite such absurd, obnoxious fanboy behavior from the 15-35 (mostly male) demographic (just look at the 2000+ reviews here). I'm tempted to ask folks who say this is 'brilliant' or 'genius' (the two most common adjectives signifying fanboydom): HAVE YOU EVER HEARD MUSIC BEFORE???    It's OK; it's AVERAGE. It's better than Britney Spears' early work. It's *hardly* groundbreaking. It's *just* 'weird' enough, and *just* commercial enough - like an Alexander Payne movie. It's 'experimental' pop for the masses.    The fact that they take themselves SOOO seriously - and that their fans take them SOOO seriously - only highlights their parodic value.    People: Get over it, and Get over yourselves. There's MUCH better and MUCH more interesting music out there.

This book is so realistic in that it shows what power love can have over the long haul and in spite of all obstacles. The husband and wife in this story are so real to me and can help you believe in true love if you are a cynic. I think the type of love this couple has in The Notebook is something we all can strive for. The actors in this do a wonderful job and you definitely feel their feelings right along with them.

B001N26GFM|5.0|I never read this book, but it's one that after watching this movie, I wish I had.  The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a nice slow paced film that has sort of a \\"day in the life of\\" feel to it.  Young Bruno is 8 years old and pretending to be an airplane flying through the streets of Berlin playing with his friends.  When he arrives home, he discovers that he has to move away and leave his friends.  His father, a German Commander, has to go away because he has a new job and he's taking his family with him.<br /><br />At first, Bruno's new home seems very office-like and cold, until a distant farm he can see from his bedroom window catches his interest.  But the farm seems odd.  All the farmers are wearing striped pajamas.  A tutor comes to teach Bruno and his sister.  His sister soon loses all interest in her dolls and turns to the current events - the war and the extermination of the Jews.  But Bruno doesn't understand.  He wants to get outside the garden walls and away from the house to go exploring.  When he finally escapes, he approaches the barbed wire fence surrounding the \\"farm\\" and he finds another 8 year old boy like himself on the other side of the wire.<br /><br />For me, Bruno's niavity of the situation is a lot like the way America was during the Holocaust.  Bruno is proud of his father, but he has no idea that his father is in charge of an extermination camp.  He has no idea what takes place in the camp.  He even sees a propaganda film which makes the camp appear like a vacation and Bruno thinks his father is a good man.  But unfortunately, commanders in such positions had to swear on their life.  They couldn't even tell their wives what was happening.  We see this in the movie as the relationship between husband and wife begins to fall apart when Bruno's mother discovers what is happening after she asks the commander's assistant about the foul smell in the air coming from the chimneys.<br /><br />In the meantime, Bruno steals food to take to his friend, but he doesn't know why his new friend doesn't like to play ball over the fence. Why is it dangerous?  And why must his friend always run away when the horn sounds?  When his new friend gets a chance to come to Bruno's house to clean the drinking glasses, Bruno gives him a snack but a guard catches him.  Bruno lies and says he doesn't know the boy and that he stole the food.  Bruno returns to the barbed wire fence for several days, eager to apologize, but his friend is not there.  Of course, you fear the worst thinking the boy has been killed due to Bruno's actions, but the young prisoner soon returns.  To make up for what he did, Bruno wants to help the boy find his father, but he soon discovers his friendship with the boy in the striped pajamas could have dangerous consequences.<br /><br />Most of us have been touched by the story of Anne Frank or some other Holocaust story that we read in our history books or saw in the movie theater.  This movie will be no different for you.  The innocence you see on the screen just in the two boys' eyes alone will pierce your heart and haunt you.  Like me, you'll probably hold your breath through most of it as if you were walking on egg shells.  Holocaust movies rarely have a happy ending, but I'm not going to spoil this ending for you.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|I just started listening to Jeff Beck about a year ago.  As with all musicians, there is some to like and some to not like, but his playing style is a bit unique which drives a uniqueness in his sound.  In other words you kind of know it's him when you hear it and nobody else plays it the way he does.  If you've been listening to him for a while, this may be more of the same, but with a guy this talented more is always better than less.  If you're starting with this one, then you can't go wrong.  After listening to the CD, I had to pick up the DVD as well.
B000TGCR3I|3.0|The artwork carries the bulk of the weight here. Though the dialog has a wonderful atmosphere but the story itself feels vacant. I made it halfway through this story before giving up. Unfortunate too. Visually, you couldn't ask for more mesmerizing characters. But the trance is broken every 15 minutes when you realize the story hasn't really taken you much further than where you started from the beginning. Three stars for character design and some truly oneiric artistry. But that's about all I can scrounge up for a movie that forced me to abandon it halfway through it.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This movie is so great in so many ways, I could not possibly write a review that would do it justice.  Get it.  Watch it now, 6 months from now, a year from now, 10 years from now... You'll get something new from it every time.    I thought Clint Eastwood peaked with Unforgiven, but I'm glad to see that I was wrong.  Still, I hope this isn't the last we'll see of Clint Eastwood.  I'm still hoping he'll do a \\"retired Dirty Harry in an old folks home\\" movie.  A predictable setup where Dirty Harry is now in an assisted living facility that gets robbed and harrassed by some neighborhood punks, so he rallies the old guys for some geriatric revenge using some of that unpredictable Dirty Harry style.

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|I thought everyone did a magnificient acting job in this.<br /><br />Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman / Bruce Wayne was actually quite subtle. As Wayne, he was suave and confident; and at the same time, unassuming. As Batman, he came across as determined and unstoppable; and, as the Joker said, incorruptible. His conversations with the Joker revealed his own inner pain. And that is what Batman is really all about: darkness, pain, and obsession.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart did marvelously as Harvey Dent. The transformation from the DA committed to law and order into a ruined man incapable of dealing with his own pain and loss, and determined to impose his own new ideas about chaos upon the world was brilliant.<br /><br />But it was Heath Leger as the Joker who really stole the show. Unlike the flamboyant interpretation Jack Nicholson did in 1989, his was an irredeemable and scruffy psychotic. Totally insane. Pure evil. Zero empathy. A sociopath \\"agent of chaos\\" that would have had Hannibal Lechter raising an eyebrow; and at the same time brilliant and insightful.<br /><br />The real difference between Nicholson's Joker and Ledger's Joker was that Nicholson's Joker was a flamboyant criminal: Ledger's was a completely unhinged sociopath. Utterly subhuman, like the Bush administration (oops! Did I say that??? Sorry). These are two completely different kinds of insanity. I guess it depends upon what you envision that role should be.<br /><br />And its an open question. Batman's origins we know about. Batman is the product of fear and obsession. The origins of Nicholson's Joker were no mystery; but Ledger's Joker we haven't a clue. A completely unpredictable lunatic with facial scars and warpaint / makeup (which he used not only as a psy-op weapon, but to hide whatever he was inside), and no evidence of any traceable history. Nicholson's Joker wanted attention and money: Ledger's Joker didn't care about anything but chaos and destruction.<br /><br />Ledger's Joker had some other interesting traits. He was totally twisted, but knew exactly how to push other people's psychological buttons. His henchmen were mentally unstable men who he had essentially brainwashed (can you imagine what it would be like to work for him?). During the interrogation scene, the Joker knew all of Batman's weaknesses, and the undeniable fact that he was, in the long run, all alone. This proved true at the end when the whole city turned against him. He understood Batman better than Batman understood himself - or would admit to himself. And his conversation with Dent in the hospital was really the final push that sent Dent into complete insanity. The Joker essentially brainwashed him.<br /><br />When he was apprehended by the police, he exploited the main weakness the police had: they treated him like a criminal. He was not a criminal by any stretch of the imagination. he was a psychopath: which is very different from a criminal. He was also a formidable adversary. A skilled fighter, brilliant improviser, and was incapable of caring what happened to him. Every time he was face to face with pain or death, he laughed.<br /><br />The lines he delivered were unbelievable: \\"You won't kill me because of some misguided sense of self righteousness, and I won't kill you because you're just too much fun!\\"<br /><br />I am inclined to believe that the role may have been instrumental in Ledger's death. Any actor must face the danger of becoming too deeply immersed in the character he / she is playing. Daniel Day Lewis is a perfect example. Ledger went deep into a realm of utter madness to develop the Joker and convincingly play him. Maybe too deep. It was probably hard for him to come back to being Heath Ledger; and he underestimated the effect the role had on his psyche.<br /><br />There seems to be another subtext to this movie.<br /><br />Harvy Dent was the \\"Hope\\" of the new order; but proved himself to be a \\"two face\\" as some suspected him to be, when things turned onhim. Batman is the vigilante who, in the end, takes the hatred and frustration of Gotham City upon himself as an act of self-sacrifice for the greater good. Could this be an allegory for the Bush administration, whose figurehead took upon himself the hatred of the whole world as a similar act of self-sacrifice? Wouldn't that place the \\"new\\" administration, whose foundation of \\"hope\\" is well known, in the role of the ill fated Harvey? And wouldn't that make anyone who thought outside the rhetoric of this \\"new order\\" a dangerous lunatic like the Joker? Is \\"The Dark Knight\\" mere political propaganda disguised as action entertainment?<br /><br />No; that's too outlandish an idea. I shouldn't even write such things.Gotham City upon himself as an act of self-sacrifice for the greater good.

0618918248|5.0|So, here we are: a retired minister (92) and an agnostic (now 63 but agnostic since 13 years of age), both reading Richard Dawkin's \\"The God Delusion.\\" Much to my surprise, we discover that we're both #6 on Dawkin's 7 point scale. A retired minister, for heaven's sake!<br /><br />This book is so well-written that I'm inspired to study it, to make notes as though I were still at college and cribbing for the finals. I imagine myself fully armed to take on the Christian Right the next time I meet one of them (some of my best friends are fundamentalists.)<br /><br />Of course, I know I won't convince any of them, even with Dawkin's wit and logic in my arsenal, but I know I'll have some really fun discussions with those who are willing to enter the fray.<br /><br />If you read this one, together with Susan Jacoby's \\"The Age of American Unreason,\\" you might end up despairing over the power wielded by the Christian Right in the US as much as I do...and I'm a Canadian.<br /><br />If you're a thoughtful person and as concerned as I am about the threats to the world from fundamentalists of all persuasions, this book is highly recommended reading.
0887307280|5.0|This is a really phenomenal book.  The concepts are not so overly intellectual that you are smacking yourself on the forehead - yet, like so many 'truths' they hit you like 'I know that' but in fact, you really didn't or you would have been doing it... =}      What I especially like about this book is that it gives a few diamonds of action that the reader can immediately put to use in their business, I absolutely loved the concept of creating a from the end in mind Org Chart.  This has proven to be invaluable for our organization.    The only criticism I may have is that most people who are going to be reading this book have precious little time to dedicate to any one book and it's a little verbose...     But the content is crucial, especially for anyone leaving the work force who is planning on starting their own business.  Read this first.  Highly recommended.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I didn't know a lot about Jason Mraz before I bought this CD except for \\"I'm Yours\\".  The first time through, I thought \\"well...this is okay...but the most popular song is definitely the best\\"....but after a few listens, I am a fan for sure! The songs tell a story that is easy to get wrapped up in and you find yourself listening harder, so you don't miss any words. Could listen to this over and over!
B001XUR8C4|1.0|I enjoy Georgette Heyer's Regency romances, and Cotillion is one of her funniest books. I was happy to have it on my Kindle -- until I discovered that it was horrendously formatted. Paragraphs were inconsistently indented, some paragraph breaks missing altogether -- try interpreting a conversation where the paragraphs run together -- and in two chapters the line breaks were so poorly done that they were virtually unreadable. I asked Amazon for my money back and got it.    BUT -- If Sourcebooks re-edits the book properly, I'd consider buying it again.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|There are enough reviews telling about the story line for this book. I was a little hesitant to buy it because many of the reviews I read weren't that great.  My reading time is limited, and I choose carefully the books I read because I want them to be worth my time! I loved the story, loved the characters and after I finished the book (quickly, I might add because I didn't want to put it down!) and reflected a few minutes on the story, I felt great! I disagree completely with those that say it's just an OK book.  Nicholas Sparks always puts heart in his stories, and this is no exception.  Well worth the time you will spend reading the book!
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|Just kidding.  About 11 times better the second time around. 1st time--action-packed non-stop chase movie with gratuitous powerless fleeting emotional interludes and bad guys with incomprehensible  motives.  2nd time--action-packed non-stop chase movie movingly interrupted with dramatic emotional interludes between characters and, well, the usual bad guy motives.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I rarely review things on Amazon, but Band of Brothers was so excellent, I just had to put in my two cents.  So many war epics go for either the \\"realism\\" route (i.e. violent battles) or what I call the \\"philosophical\\" route, essentially making it seem as though war is a classroom where soldiers debate the pros and cons of what they are doing.  But Band of Brothers doesn't fall into either of those traps.    Essentially, by the end, you will feel like a member of Easy Company.  You'll understand them as people, share in their fears and their hopes for what the end of the war can be, and have the utmost respect for the sacrifices they made.  You'll laugh at the occasional shenanigans they pull to keep themselves sane, while you'll also feel the incredible sorrow when one of their brethren falls.    Band of Brothers might be the best piece of work ever committed to film.  I realize that is an incredibly bold statement, but it will be well worth your time to see if you agree.  Every moment of this miniseries is incredibly well done--including the opening credits, which I was happy to sit through before each episode.    I highly recommend the Blu-ray version.  The detail in the pictures is simply amazing.
B00122M2QU|2.0|It has its moments, but overall this alblum is a dissapointment.  Igor sounds bored and Max is singing about the exact same stuff he has been for the last 10 years.  There are a couple of good songs and the lead guitar work is pretty great.  This alblum is hardly the triumphant return that we all were hoping for.  To be honest the new Sepultura alblum, A-Lex, blows this away.  I got Inflikted the week it came out and have only listened to it a few times since.  When I do I'm sad,  2.5 stars.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Frankly, this film did not have good word of mouth as it came to me, but alas, Im a huge Bond fan, so I had to see it.  This movie starts where Royale left off, with Mr. White in tow, from the first scene onward I felt I was watching a Bourne film, I kept waiting for Craig to turn and be staring at Damon in the mirror, like some sort of lame Mission Impossible gag.  This is not a bad film, hardly Casino Royale, but better than the Bronsan yawners, it just seemed so kinetic and honestly, as times I had a hard time understand what the hellz they were saying.  Matheiu is a HORRIBLE villain, he looks like Roman Palanski crossed with a toad, he has no presence AT ALL, it's like with Casino Royale and that zero that bled from the eye, I mean, what the f?, is this all they can come up with?  The reason behind the villians motives is just the limit, I mean, WATER? and dont get me started on the bizarre title, I realize it's a metaphor for Bond and Vesper, but still, it's a mouthfull.  All and all, fast paced, nicely acted(love Dench), but really lots of noise signifying nothing, really im already forgetting this movie, uh what's the title again?
B001PPLIFU|2.0|I saw this movie in the theater and loved it. I was really looking forward to purchasing the blu ray and bringing it home to watch. But after putting it in my Samsung BD-P1000 . I got a message that this title would not playing through an analog connection and I should use the HDMI connector to watch the program. Well  since my television (a 54\\" Mitsubishi HD ready set) only supports HD through component connectors and does not have a HDMI port I guess I need to return it and settle for the normal DVD edition. While I understand that I can only watch in 1080i with my TV I really can't afford to spend the money for a new TV in order to watch new movies. I would not be so upset about this if the packaging mentioned the fact that a digital connection is required for playback.  I own nearly 50 Blu ray movies and have had problems in the past that required firmware updates and I have faithfully downloaded the latest and installed them, but I had never had this message before.  I understand why the studios want copy protection, but this is a problem.  I am really concerned that if I attempt to replace my DVD's with Blu rays I won't be able to watch them and will not be willing to get the DVD replacement since I already own them. If anyone knows how to tell which movies require HDMI to watch, I would appreciate them filling me in.
0618001905|4.0|I picked this book up because it was the required reading for the '09 UIL Social Studies competition and was blow away. I knew next to nothing about this period of African/European colonial history. Hochschild does an excellent job at taking the reader through one of the saddest and least remembered pieces of African colonial history. This book many times elicited such a gut reaction from me that I had to pause and collect myself before continuing on. Highly recommended.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I have the director's cut on standard DVD, but after getting a blu-ray player I read that this format is a must have if you are a Blade Runner fan.  It was well worth it!  I was concerned that because of the age of the movie that it would not come across well on blu-ray, but the picture quality is fantastic.  The sound quality is better as well.   Also, since Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner is such a long documentery I thought I'd watch it in halves, but I could not turn it off...it was so fascinating!      If you are a fan of this movie, the step up to the blu-ray version is well worth it!
B001TODCII|5.0|Northern Ireland born actor, Liam Neeson hits a grand-slam with this taunt, action film.  Cast as retired Secret Service Agent, Bryan Mills.  Much to his dismay, Mills learns that daughter, Kim, played by Maggie Grace of \\"Lost\\" fame, will be traveling to Paris to follow U2's Euopean concert tour.  Although he is unhappy about it, there is little he can do, as ex-wife, Lenore, encourages the trip.  While there, Kim is kidnapped by a group of Albanese and forced into slave trafficking.  Mills, using all of his tricks of the trade and connections only has 96 hours to find his daughter before she is gone forever.  Mills travels to Paris to rescue her and he will let nothing stand in his way.  This film had me literally sitting on the edge of my seat threw out many of the action scenes.  Neeson, an ex-boxer, is perfectly cast as the steamrolling Mills, allowing no one to stop him.  I was pleasantly surprised at how believable Neeson is in it.  Once the action begins it never lets up and Neeson performance only drives this picture even faster and harder.  Any other actor, makes this film a joke.  If high-octane action and bone-cracking fight scenes are your thing, then \\"Taken\\" is for you!  I saw it, I loved it, I was taken by it!

B000O77SOK|5.0|I LOVED this show and have bought all of the seasons of BOSTON LEGAL and would like to get all of The Practice too, but I won't buy it until I know I can get the rest. I have friends that STARTED with BOSTON LEGAL and when I told them that was a spin off of The Practice they were excited to see them as well........but looks like that can't happen. I hope someday they do release them all. I also had the same problem with MURPHY BROWN, I wanted to get all of those and there is only Season 1 - they said not enough interest/sales of Season 1 to warrant releasing the others. I found that out after I had BOUGHT Season 1. So I am torn as to whether or not buy it anyway (season 1 of The Practice)

B0009UC7QQ|5.0|The Truman Show was a delightful comedy.  Can you imagine a life that has been scripted since birth?  Sometimes I feel like this myself.  Who's following me?  Where are the hidden button cameras?  But this review is not about my script!<br /><br />Ed Harris as the director, almost a father figure.  He cares, he wants this show to work, but he gets intensly involved in Truman's life.  And a former girlfriend who leads a Free Truman activist group.<br /><br />The coordinated 24 hour a day life of Truman start coming apart when a studio light falls from the sky, closely followed by his father unexpectedly showing up.  Oh my gosh!!<br /><br />The ending was satisfying.  No spoilers, you gotta see it. It really gets funny when he tries to be unpredictible and the studio attempts to stop him at every turn.<br /><br />I'm not a huge Carrey fan, but if you want great family entertainment and the insidious reality of main media TV, check out this film.<br /><br />Other cool Carrey films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00081912E The Mask (New Line Platinum Series)]]<br />[[ASIN:0783225512 Liar Liar]]<br /><br />[But avoid Batman Forever, please!]
0316143472|4.0|This is the second book by Sedaris that I've read at the insistence of my co-worker (first was Naked). And although I enjoyed it more than Naked, I still don't understand why he is called one of the funniest writers out there. Based on the reviews, I am not the only one who thinks that way. Yes, sometimes he can be quite ironic or sarcastic, but laugh-out-loud funny? I don't think so.<br /><br />Once again we are presented with an anthology of autobiographical essays. Several of them are funny, some are sad, some I just didn't bother to finish.<br /><br />I am surprised Sedaris does not venture beyond these life stories about his family, his sexuality, his bizarre youth and adulthood. After all, if anything, he is a great observer. This is why I enjoyed so much his last essay in the book about his attempt to quit smoking in Japan. I didn't care for the smoking part, but his notes about Japanese culture were clever and witty. Why can't he write more of that?
B001O8C5KK|1.0|This Butterfly could never in light years beat Von Karajan's version with Mirella Freni and Luciano Pavarotti.  She is the Butterfly of all time; and of course there is the greatness of Renata Scotto and  Maria Callas. This Decca recording of Freni's has been in circulation on LP and CD for over 36 years (along with Callas and Scotto); and then there is too, the La Boheme with Freni and Pavarotti, and this set has by- passed all contenders (recent), especially the Gheorghiu set.    Angela Gheorghiu is alright here, but, she has no real solid top, and she sounds quite often, off pitch,with a kind of manufactured dramatic edge to her voice thrown in, but this could be the equalizers.    .   And all the equalizers at the studio are at work for this CD set. Butterfly's initial entrance is a prime example: Gheorghiu comes on,shaky, and suddenly, at the close, is this high note, which is called for, but here it is obviously glued on, a note that has no relation to Gheorghiu's voice at all. Maybe it is the high note of a studio back -up soprano, like a stand in in films. Who can say? But listen to Mirella Freni or to Renata Scotto, and experience how natural they are in this opening scene, especially  Madame Freni ,at the  very close of the scene, with her fabulous pianissimo high note.    But, this EMI Butterfly is better than Gheorghiu's Manon, Tosca, Il Trovatore(whew!!), and many others. But then, where are we?    So sad that Renee Fleming and others are denied the studios for complete recordings.    .

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I have everything Rush has ever sold. This is the finest concert recorded .......ever. The performance, lights , sound, ans song selection are the best they have ever done. I have seen them so many times that there are those great songs they never do......here they have performed many of their best that they never perform with many standards. Witch Hunt alone was worth the purchase. I am now buying the Blue Ray version since I got a player. Their other dvds are great but this is best recording of a music performance ever.....not just another compilation of what you have already seen. The filming is breathtaking and there are lots of humorous moments too. Neil Peart seems to be out of his funk he has seemed to be in for so long and that makes me very glad for him. He is one of my personal heroes and my favorite drummer of all time.
B000000W5P|5.0|Some Girls is easily one of the best albums ever released by The Rolling Stones. I love the music; they truly demonstrate that they could do a variety of songs and make every one of them sound great! The Stones did indeed have very productive sessions when recording this material; and this shows in the songs we get. The quality of the sound is excellent; and the artwork on that cover is excellent.<br /><br />The CD starts with the memorable hit \\"Miss You.\\" Mick Jagger sings this so darn well I'm convinced nobody could have sung it better than he did. That disco influenced style of rock music goes just right with his singing and it makes \\"Miss You\\" a very strong opening tune for this album! Jagger and the band do this one up right as they bat it straight out of the ballpark; and that percussion marks the best really well. \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" has a distinctly rock flavor to it; this rocks hard and The Rolling Stones deliver this with gusto--to say the least! The music again fits in quite well with the lyrics and that's awesome.<br /><br />\\"Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)\\" is a shining example of just how well The Stones could cover a song; they sing this one with heart and soul and they never let go of a superfluous note! Mick Jagger in particular has the perfect voice for this tune; and the guitar work enhances the ballad even more. \\"Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)\\" is a fine example of a rock band covering a tune that certainly wasn't rock when I last heard it done by The Temptations!<br /><br />\\"Some Girls,\\" is, of course, the title track and it features an excellent arrangement for guitar. The song explores how both women as well as their men buy or give each other things and even children to show their affection (well, mostly to show their affection); these lyrics provide an interesting twist on the way men have traditionally given things to women but it certainly works. The lyrics are awesome when you hear them. In addition, \\"Far Away Eyes\\" has a fine country flavor; when The Stones perform this they totally amaze me with their incredible sense of timing and their flawless delivery. \\"Far Away Eyes\\" is one of my favorite songs on this album.<br /><br />\\"Respectable\\" does indeed feature some outstanding bluesy \\"wailing\\" just as Amazon says that it does; but the element of rock is unmistakable and believe it or not the combination of that bluesy wailing and the hard rock element hold together very well. \\"Beast Of Burden\\" is one of their best hits ever; \\"Beast Of Burden\\" has a fine arrangement and Mick Jagger sings this without a hitch. The melody is actually even pretty when you hear it and the backup vocals aren't too shabby, either. The album ends strong with The Rolling Stones performing the punk rock sounding \\"Shattered\\" which was a huge hit for them; it remains one of their best songs to this day.<br /><br />Overall, Some Girls by The Rolling Stones gives us a lot to enjoy. The music is outstanding and this is nothing short of a brilliant work of art. I highly recommend this for fans of bands similar to The Stones; I simply assume that fans of The Stones already have this in their collections. In addition, this CD is not a bad place to start if you're just getting to know the artistry of The Rolling Stones.try flavor; when The Stones perform this they totally amaze me with their incredible sense of timing and their flawless delivery. \\"Far Away Eyes\\" is one of my favorite songs on this album.    \\"Respectable\\" does indeed feature some outstanding bluesy \\"wailing\\" just as Amazon says that it does; but the element of rock is unmistakable and believe it or not the combination of that bluesy wailing and the hard rock element hold together very well. \\"Beast Of Burden\\" is one of their best hits ever; \\"Beast Of Burden\\" has a fine arrangement and Mick Jagger sings this without a hitch.

I do believe she tried to mother Kevin, but receiving no response to your slightest affection, must be truly devastating.    Franklin actually repulsed me.

0440241901|3.0|Okay, i'm the minority here. I dislike Emma so much; she's silly, she expected to get promote but didn't work hard enough; she supposed to sign a deal for the company but the whole time she sit there she had manage to not understand the other company wanted; but she still expected to get promote because she has been working in the company for a year. When she hate people, she feed their plant juice or st equal. She will meet her millionare prince charming  who will come and rescuse her. Lesson from this book: you don't have to work so hard, you can be one to gossip, be a little cute , and honest; you can be petty too. With that, a rich guy will come along.   The reason i give this book a 3 stars is its hummor, very funny, but the female charater is just too silly, very close to airhead
0553582461|3.0|I began the Tawny Man trilogy with much anticipation, having enjoyed the Farseer trilogy previously. The characters in both trilogies are very well-delineated as is the world they inhabit. I appreciate Robin Hobb's ability to create believable characters and that she does not shy away from hurting them. However...     SPOILERS BELOW       In Fool's Fate I feel that any previous ideas Ms. Hobb had for the resolution of the relationship between Fitz and the Fool suffered a failure to launch. I believe the breakdown occurs when she allows the Fool to suffer such a horrible death. Even though she allows Fitz as the Changer to go beyond death to bring the Fool back, in doing so it is as if she decides that even their close bond could not overcome the way in which the Fool died. While I appreciated very much the scenes after the Fool's restoration where Fitz has finally accepted that he and the Fool have a love that transcends all differences, what I can't fathom is how Fitz can walk away from this knowledge and seek out a love relationship with Molly that is truly pallid by comparison. Fitz stayed away from Molly not just because his own \\"death\\" was an established fact for her, but because he knew she could not accept his bond with Nighteyes. His bond with the Fool, once acknowledged, is much the same: a love without limits between two individuals who are organically different. I for one do not feel that Fitz could walk away from that recognition and back to Molly without any indication of regret or understanding of why the Fool must leave. This is a glaring inconsistency to me. If it is the Fool's choice to withdraw the link he and Fitz share, then the Fool becomes the Changer. It is he who makes this decision. Would Fitz have chosen all those years before not to bond with Nighteyes simply because they are two different creatures with mismatched life spans? I realize this is what motivated Burrich to deny his Wit, but Fitz did not do so and never expressed any regret for his own choice, even when it brought him such grief. So why would the Fool pull away when it was he that always said that he placed no limits on his love for Fitz? I never got the feeling that the Fool feared for himself, so if he is trying to spare Fitz more pain then he is acting counter to his nature. He always trusted that Fitz would choose rightly and he knew that would mean suffering on Fitz' part. So why is it okay now for the Fool to prevent Fitz a pain that Fitz himself is willing to accept?     I agree with what some other reviewers have said. I think the Fool was supposed to be revealed as female at some point and that a very sweet, nontraditional romance was being suggested in the previous two books of this trilogy. But when Robin Hobb tortured the Fool and allowed Fitz to bring him back from the dead, there was no safe refuge for the Fool to flee to for healing as there once was for Fitz in his relationship to Nighteyes. That kind of experience was something the Fool had no resources for dealing with and it seems to me that making the Fool reveal himself to actually be female and therefore Fitz' true partner could not be done. It would not ring true to the Fool's death experience and the whole post-traumatic stress situation he manifests after Fitz brings him back to life. I am not actually sorry for that development. If the book had stopped after the scene with Girl on a Dragon and the Fool restoring to Fitz his early memories and pain, then I could probably give this book four stars. What irks me is the idea that once Fitz is \\"complete\\" through his bond with the Fool and his restored memories that he could then blithely take up a banal courtship of his lost love and be satisfied with that. He never expresses regret that he lost the opportunity to see the Fool one more time, nor does he show any distress that the Fool came looking for him while Fitz was lost in the Skill pillar. Does it mean nothing to him that his closest friend now believes he is dead, especially when that has been a thorn in Fitz' side with regard to all his loved ones believing him dead for 16 years? I suppose I could excuse this mysterious lack of emotion because of the transcendent nature of the bond between the Fool and Fitz. But once the Fool severed their Skill-link it seemed to me that what Hobb was suggesting was that Fitz felt once again as he did after Nighteyes died -- as if he were missing a part of himself. As indeed he is, because if he and the Fool complete one another then what the Fool does by removing their link is cruel. It is almost like a suicide. If the Fool is not supposed to effect change, how does he justify making this choice? It profoundly affects Fitz' future after all. It apparently renders Fitz blind enough to what he truly wants that he is able to accept the mundane traditional role of husband to a housewife as the epitome of happiness. I'm sorry, I just can't accept that as the \\"happy ending\\" to this epic. (And I state this as a happily-married housewife!!!)     There is also the problem of Fitz' place in Buckkeep. If he is willing to act as a shadow king, then why does he not do so after he finally recognizes and verbally accepts that role? If he is supposed to be Skillmaster, why are only a few token sentences given to that responsibility? Most of the ending of the book is an overly-detailed account of his correspondence with Molly and her boys, his obsession with courting her from afar, and how he travels to see her. If I am being forced to accept that Molly is Fitz' reward then I guess I see the point of making that the focus of the last 100 pages. But it left aside the political role that Fitz would have been playing behind the scenes of Dutiful's reign. Fitz is no Chade but I don't think he would have so completely lost interest in his responsibility to his Farseer heritage. Chade's Machiavellian attitude still needs balancing and it is as if Fitz has decided to ignore that fact in favor of pressing hissuit with Molly. Yet another inconsistency that bothered me.     I am not sorry to have read this trilogy, but the inconsistencies and the ending of Fool's Fate left me feeling very dissatisfied.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Out of Norway comes a fantastic little vampire movie. Centered around a outcast 12 year old, he befriends a 12 year old vampiric girl. Most of the movie is a very close and personal movie about the boy and his struggles with bullies, divorced parents, and having no friends. In between are scenes of the vampire, the building friendship, and ultimate resolution. The story is rather predictable, but it's done so well that you don't mind. It's more suspenseful than horror, but there are a few bloody scenes that keep the pacing. Not often can a vampire horror movie be considered charming. And that's what makes this movie special.    There is a bit of controvesy over the subtitles. Apparently the distributor dumbed down the dialog for the US release. But they are releasing a new version with the original subtitles. Without seeing the new version, I can say that the current subtitles are servicable and don't detract from the movie at all. And stay away from the dubbing. It is horrible.
B001NY42KQ|4.0|Excellent DVD. Music was fantastic. It was good to see the current class come to end. It was a goo set of movies. Upbeat & fun while still telling a story.
B000CE9R26|3.0|\\"Cats Without Claws\\" is definitely NOT vintage Donna Summer.  But while it was probably the second best of Donna's four 1980's CDs (The best being 1983's \\"She Works Hard for the Money\\"), it's nowhere near as brilliant as her work during her 1970's heyday. True, the album has several gimmicky songs that are downright silly (\\"Eyes,\\" \\"Cats Without Claws\\"), but other tracks--such as her terrific remake of the Drifters' \\"There Goes My Baby,\\" \\"Supernatural Love\\" and the mesmerizing soft-rock of \\"Oh Billy Please\\"--chug along pleasantly enough, bouyed by the synthesizer-drenched sound then in vogue.  But the most stunning cut of all is actually a plainative, piano-based, spiritual ballad, \\"Forgive Me.\\"  As most fans know, Summer went public about her born-again christianity (and sparked a major controversy over anti-gay remarks, which she has repeatedly denied making), but \\"Forgive Me\\" is probably her most overt declaration of the role of religion in her life.  Even so, \\"Forgive Me\\" has a melody so stunning (and is so beautifully sung) that it could even keep the staunchest atheist hanging onto every word!!!   \\"Forgive Me\\" is definitely the song that will dispel any doubts about Summer's ballad-singing prowess and, as such, is the one song that DEFINITELY makes \\"Cats Without Claws\\" worth having.

0060935464|5.0|Author of [[ASIN:0473125382 Afinidad: A novel of a serial killer]]<br /><br />To my mind, this is the best book ever written. It has everything in it that a novel should have: unforgettable characters that you come to love, especially the two children at the heart of the novel, Scout, who narrates the story over a period of three summers, and her brother, Jem, but an erstwhile villain, Bo Radley, comes to find a place in your heart in the end as well; so descriptive of place and time (Alabama, 1930s) that you have to re-orientate yourself to your own surroundings when you put the book down, and the superb regional dialogue plays no small part in that; and a truly interesting storyline that keeps you deeply involved until the last page. The central story is the defence of a black man who is accused of raping a white woman by Atticus, the children's father. However, there is much, much more to the book than that.  There is the innocent play of children in the blistering hot Southern summers; there is the angst they experience as they mature, especially poor Scout failing to conform to the accepted notion of a young Southern lady; and overall, there is the love and respect of a father for his children. There is also great drama in the book. Scout's father is forced to confront a mob set on lynching his client; Jem gets stalked by some terrifying presence one night; a rabid dog goes beserk and needs to be shot. The writing is so powerful that you are on the edge of your seat as these scenes unfold, and that includes some terrifc courtroom ones as Atticus roots out the truth behind the accusation of rape.<br /> There is a persistent rumor that this book was written by Harper Lee's great childhood friend, Truman Capote, and that wouldn't surprise me at all. I didn't get to Truman's books until years after reading and loving this one, but when I did, I thought the style of writing was exactly the same, and just as brilliant. So I personally think that there may be some truth in the rumor, or at the very least, that he gave a great deal of assistance.....<br />As a bonus, it is a must for anyone who wants to gain insight into the Southern way of thinking seventy odd years ago.umor, or at the very least, that he gave a great deal of assistance.....

1577314808|4.0|Author of [[ASIN:0473125382 Afinidad: A novel of a serial killer]]<br />This book changed my life - but not overnight.  Its message is so profoundly different to what most of us are familiar with that it can take months for it to sink in (and several readings) and for it to be something that we can actually practice on a daily basis.  But it is well worth the effort.  Eckhart Tolle points out repeatedly that our uncontrolled, undisciplined mind is the greatest enemy we have and that we must bring it under control if we are to enjoy our life.  There is, however, much more to his message than just that.  He explains how the concept of time, which, to him (and to millions of Buddhists), is an illusion and to live your life by it is to miss out on the peace and satisfaction that is derived by living wholly in the Now. If you live your life dwelling on the past, he says, you are probably ruled by regrets or guilt or a sense of being a victim, all of which is totally pointless; on the other hand, if you think mainly of what the future holds for you, then you are likely not smelling the roses on the way there and you miss out on what life has to offer you right now, or you will be consumed by anxieties and fears that may never happen (although, if you know about the law of attraction, you will understand that they will because you are creating them by your focus upon them).  Tolle teaches that the way out of the trap of time is complete surrender to the now, the present.  Such surrender is not passive; it is, in fact, a very active and conscious choice to allow what is, and that ain't easy.  If you think it is, try it next time something is happening that you don't like.  You will then see that everything in you will protest and your mind will go ...\\"But he shouldn't do that to me..\\" or \\"but I don't want to have to do that...\\" That is resistance, and Tolle points out that it is complete insanity to resist what happens and yet, when you think about it, that is what many of us do a large part of every day, whether it's hating the people you work with, hating your actual job, hating where you live, and so on.  Such resistance brings continual suffering, even if that suffering is relatively mild as in feelings of irritation, frustration, or dislike.  The Power of Now will teach you how and why you should actually accept all that happens, and, further, that such acceptance does not mean that you can't make changes or set goals, because you can; you will take whatever action is necessary and then let it go and be fully present in the now again.<br />One concept Tolle writes about that particularly resonated with me is what he calls the `pain body'.  Sometimes he makes it sound like an entity that possesses someone, like an evil spirit, which made me squirm a bit, but he is not suggesting that at all.  He is, I think, merely trying to get us to look at the emotional baggage we carry around and see the incredible destruction such baggage can cause to ourselves and those around us.  By embracing his teachings about time, though, we can be freed from such destruction and thus live a much happier life.  In fact, he teaches us to observe ourselves at all times, not just when we need healing.  Such observation leads ultimately to a sense of our own spirituality because there has to be a part of ourselves doing the observing in the first place and what is that if it isn't something outside the realm of mind and body?<br />Another thing this book did for me was shed a most luminious light on the sayings of Christ, sayings that I have been familiar with all my life but really had quite limited understanding of.  For example, Tolle claims that 'the peace of God that passes all understanding; turn the other cheek' are expressions of being prepared to surrender to what is in life.  Christ constantly extolled his listeners not to worry 'for worry will not add a day to your life'.  Tolle made me see that the practice of surrender to the now will eliminate the tendency to worry because that is something that is almost always done about some imaginary event in the future.<br />If you have had an absolute gutsful of the way your life never seems to go right, if you have come to realise that the way you approach life may have something to do with that and you want to change it, then you are ready for this book.  But remember the ad for Pantene shampoo (or do we only get that down here in the South Pacific?) - it won't happen overnight, but it will happency to worry because that is something that is almost always done about some imaginary event in the future.    If you have had an absolute gutsful of the way your life never seems to go right, if you have come to realise that the way you approach life may have something to do with that and you want to change it, then you are ready for this book.

B000NQRV4O|3.0|Three out of the four  people are really unlikable.  Alice (Jane) is the most  fragile and likable and the one who comes out in one piece.    The others are truly sick people (well Anna is more normal than the rest although not by much).  No one sticks with their partner very long (except poor Alice/Jane).    Appalling is a better word for this movie; however, I was unable to look away and I think this movie will stick with me for a long time.  I came away with my own thoughts on relationships: difficult, bitter, demanding and ugly at times.  What a depressing afterthought after watching a movie.    It's worth watching if you don't mind vulgar and very sexual situations. If those offend you, don't watch.  No way of skipping past them.

B000062XFG|5.0|\\"Captain Picard, I cannot allow you to leave.  Before we can go forward, the cycle must end.\\"<br /><br />-- Picard, while shooting and killing his future self, \\"Time Squared\\"<br /><br />The first minute of the first episode of this season lays it all out for you.  We get far more advanced model and computer animation (ship exteriors), a first glimpse at the shuttle bay and a shuttle craft, a better lit and color adjusted bridge, and some sophisticated camera work, all set to a brilliant new score (not to be confused with the title theme).  All in all, it seems clear that the producers have taken fan input into account and have done everything possible to deliver a superior product for season two.<br /><br />As the episode and season continue, we discover a slew of new surprises.  For one thing, the boundaries of the ship truly expand with not only the addition of the shuttlebay, but also the introduction of Ten Forward, the social center of the ship in which we get to see more of our favorite characters off duty.  Guinan, ably played by Whoopie Goldberg, manages to pull the best from each character when the main action of the plot doesn't allow them to reveal their inner selves otherwise.  Furthermore, Season Two makes far better use of the holodeck, establishing its parameters and functions more clearly, but also presenting some of the best holodeck-oriented concepts, moments, and full-blown episodes of the series.<br /><br />Another nice surprise is the tweaks (both subtle and not so subtle) made to the cast.  Worf and Troi both receive necessary make-overs.  Wes ditches the rainbow racing stripe across the chest and matures into a relatively likeable and rarely annoying young cadet.  Geordi finally earns legitimate placement amongst the main cast by becoming Chief Engineer.  Picard drops much of the grouchy facade he bore in season one, establishing genuine rapport with much of the cast (especially Ryker).  Finally, Dr. Pulaski replaces Dr. Crusher as the ship's doctor.  While, in many ways, Pulaski is a clear and tired rip-off of Dr. McCoy from the original series, she challenges and pulls much from the crew whereas Dr. Crusher felt relatively isolated and uninteresting amongst the cast in season one (this changes when she returns in season three).<br /><br />Beyond these changes, both subtle and blatant, occurring in the background of each episode, what strikes me the most about season two is the writing.  Nearly every episode in this season brings out all the grand science fiction adventure of the original series while applying the statesman-like discourse on ethics to each adventure that later becomes Next Gen's hallmark.<br /><br />Some highlights from this season include:<br /><br />\\"A Matter of Honor,\\" in which Ryker serves on a Klingon vessel, introduces us to Klingon culture, and confronts the double-edged sword of culture shock while providing a fantastically entertaining storyline in the process.<br /><br />\\"The Measure of a Man,\\" in which Data's sentience is determined in a riveting courtroom trial with Picard as the defendant and Ryker as the prosecutor.<br /><br />\\"Contagion,\\" in which the Enterprise discovers highly imaginative and eerily advanced technology from a long-dead civilization and must decide how to keep it from the Romulans.<br /><br />\\"The Royal,\\" a highly whimsical yet disturbing episode in which Ryker, Data, and Worf are trapped in an early twentieth century casino which serves as reparation for a man who has been dead for hundreds of years.<br /><br />\\"Time Squared,\\" TNG's first great time loop story in which the crew discovers and must deal with the existential problems of an unconscious Picard from six hours in the future who fled the Enterprise shortly before it was destroyed.<br /><br />\\"Q Who\\": the return of Q, the continuation of his assessment of the human race, and the terrifying first appearance of the Borg.<br /><br />\\"Manhunt\\": Luwaxana Troi at her comic best as she tries to snare Picard as a husband.<br /><br />Honestly, though, the only disappointing episode of this season is \\"Shades of Gray,\\" the final episode which was strung together on the threshold of a writer's strike.  It's a clip show before TNG had enough worthwhile clips to warrant such an undertaking.<br /><br />All in all, TNG season two is a fantastic experience and a personal favorite season of mine.  It's still a long way from achieving all the greatness that can be found in later seasons, but there's so much here to love.  It's absolutely worth the time and money to discover this season and then revisit it, again and again.s \\"Shades of Gray,\\" the final episode which was strung together on the threshold of a writer's strike.

0767821629|5.0|This movie is similar to the Matrix but much less outrageous. The sci-fi plot is very interesting in itself and makes for one of those movies in which there are many unexpected surprises. However, I think what really makes the movie are the virtual reality recreations of Los Angeles in the 1930s. It adds a lot of character to the film. The only thing that's a little odd is how the main character is always very sullen and almost unemotional. He has an incredibly resigned an unexcitable air to him. Eventually, this sort of ends up fitting, but at first it seems a little odd. In any case, I love this movie and highly recommend it.
0345495004|1.0|Other than learning some interesting historical facts about the \\"woman movement\\" and Frank Lloyd Wright, I found nothing compelling in this often tedious novel. The prose is hackneyed, the characters one dimensional, the dialog unbelievable. Yes, the sordid affairs of famous people are inherently interesting--that's why the tabloids publish stories about them and no doubt why the novel is so popular--but I was hoping Nancy Horan had something more to offer.
B00005JLR2|5.0|My family watched this movie and we all loved it. It is funny, and has a ton of action which is great for the kids, and it shows the growth of a young boy into a man, which is an important idea for kids to learn, even if they learn it from a cartoon. This is very losely based on the Treasure Island story, but it is futuristic, and I think that they pull the story off very well. They voice actors were a great choice, and I think that this is overall one of my favorite fantasy cartoons to date. The use of pirates in the future was done quite well, and they kept the older elements of sword play while adding robots, aliens, and flying ships. This is definitly high on my list of must see movies.
0316017922|5.0|Terrific book--very thought provoking.  Still believe the type of success outlined is a combination of a proclivity towards a particular talent AND hard work....but Gladwell illustrates his theme beautifully.

B000P1QMZ6|5.0|My favorite HP movies are the first two that Chris Columbus directed. I love the whole series of books and movies, but I feel that the imagery produced by Columbus gives that added element of reality and growth of characters. Anyone that has not seen the film yet should definitly get this as soon as they can. A family film that runs over 2 hours you can be assured wil get most of the book details into it and acurate. This is no exception. I love this movie and so will you.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I was a BIG fan of this musical on the internet, and I had to buy it so I could watch it whenever I wanted. I didn't want to get it on iTunes, though it was cheaper, because I couldn't share the wonderful Dr. Horrible with other people. I'm a big Joss Whedon fan, and I think he's done very well with this one. The songs are catchy and sound great. Good story too. I think it was worth it to buy the DVD so I could take it anywhere, and for the extra features. They aren't wonderful, but if you are a Joss Whedon or Neil Patrick Harris fan, they are worth it.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|The movie was rather terrific and deeply disturbing. I agree with all the reviews but I wish more credit would go to the young actors. My favorit was Eddie Alderson, he played the young cousin of the maniac who was kept as hostage by a wretched, profound fear. The scene when Det,Lester Ybarra ( Micheal Kelly,excellent! ) is interrogating Eddie Alderson is fasinating. The actor Eddie Alderson plays (Sandford) gives us a horrifying confession of what his cousin the murderer, did to the kids : he was a child molester and sadist the scene is heartwreching. He was so broken yet feeling responsible himself, He laid it all out honestly and hurting as he did! I'm now a fan of Michael Kelly  he was tough than gentle with the boy. I loved their scenes together.  Please someone out there give me the name of the actor who played s s hahn the attorney who had taken the case for free to help Ms Collins and won. In the movie John Malkovich tells us he had won four cases against city hall and won, Then the only attorney who had done this. Please give me his name, I'd love to see anyone of his other movies!   I think its Geoff Pierson....but I can't locate a movie that he is in. Thanks to anyone who helps me. Thank You! The preacher (John Malkovich ) if he had not taken notice of Ms Collins was a true hero, in all this betrayal, who knows how long they would have kept her in that institution with shoch treatment and forced drugs.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|i'm glad i read the book first, because i wouldn't have after viewing the movie.  i understand that the screenplay had to be simplified due to the characters and various subplots, but this is minimal.  they clearly just took the highlights and made the movie from it.  it views that way too.  very choppy with not much flow nor character development.  the dubbing is awful.  it's like the worse godzilla movie.  the voices seemed annoying and it sounded as though they were reading from a script (which they were of course), with no emotion paid to the scenes.  i will watch it with the subtitles and i'm sure it will be a better view.  but overall, it's getting the hype, but it's really not that good.
0385340990|3.0|In an attempt to shake up my reading list a bit, I borrowed, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, from my local library.  After all, it has an overall rating of 4 plus stars, and generally I can get into a well-written piece of historical fiction.  Although this wasn't horrible, it just wasn't as fascinating (to me) as it was to all the reviewers that gave it four or five stars.<br /><br />My thoughts in the beginning were that it was a clever way to tell a story, using nothing but letters to and from every character in the novel.  The history was interesting as well.  Than somewhere about ½ way through the book, it turned from a well-written, intelligent, historical novel to a corny, predictable, love-story that was just not my style.  I gave it three stars because I can appreciate that some readers could really enjoy this.  If you liked the movie, Titanic, if you liked the TV series, Walton's Mountain, or if you liked the book by Lorna Landvik, Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons, then you'll like, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, too.
B001F290E4|5.0|I listened to the samples of all the tracks before buying this album and I liked what I heard.  When I got the album I was blown away - it is so good.  So many times I buy an album because of 1 or 2 tracks, but this is the first time I bought an album and enjoyed every single track - it is such great listening. What is unique about this album is that it keeps you in the mood.  So many times artistes mixed different types of music on an album probably to showcase their versatility and that annoys me because you are taken away from a smooth mellow mood to something loud and shocking.

B001RTP3Z0|4.0|Leonard Cohen commands attention for the entire concert, which is amazing considering his 74 years.  He is warm, humorous and humble to his audience and hardly makes an error in presenting over 40 years of his music.    Cohen looks and speaks like a benevolent Tony Bennett-like figure who beams at his audience after each song and clutches his hat to his chest like an ageing grandfather greeting cherished old friends at a local bus stop.    His backing musicians and female vocal group are top-notch as well.    On the down side, the technical production is disappointing.  For what would have to contend as THE concert event of the decade, the presentation in 4:3 format with a picture that could be described as analog quality at best is hardly acceptable in 2009, especially when it was recorded just last July.    The camera work is often sloppy and unimaginative.  The continuity editing is the same.    But full marks to Cohen and his band for a performance that has to be seen as well as heard.  Others have used the words \\"beautiful\\", \\"warm\\", \\"gracious\\", \\"amazing\\", \\"joyful\\" and \\"sublime\\".  I can not disagree with any of that.    Regrettably, the DVD version has not done this major musical milestone the justice it warrants but it is still worth it.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|First off, let me say I have been a Rush fan ever since High School and the 2112 lp. Recently, I bought a new cd of Rush-Vapor Trails, very cheap. As I listened to it, I could see why it was so cheap. It is so loud, I only listen to it in small doses. Wish I'd read the Amazon reviews first! I do now. Wish Rush would remix/remaster this cd, it seems to be good, just way over compressed. Thank God this cd is not that way! On my way home from Linsey Wilson College yesterday, I took this cd along for some driving music. Like another reviewer said, it took a long time for me to get it. This cd grows on you with every listen. My fave Rush song now is \\" Workin' Them Angels Overtime \\". It sounds so good to hear Alex Lifesong playing acoustic guitar again. Geddy Lee still amazes me, as a Bass player, just kinda loud. Neil Pert's drumming seems more \\" less is more \\" on this cd. His lyrics are the best yet. The mood does seem dark on here, but like \\" Hope \\" it ends on a positive note. The instrumentals on here are good also.It is the real life lyrics that stand out. The professor seems more down to Earth now. Check out Geddy Lee's interview in the new issue of Blender, it's funny.I have all 4 of Neil Pert's books. Could some Rush fans please tell me the best book to get about Rush as a band? Any helpful advice appreciated. Thanks. A former drummer turned Bass player. Love ya Geddy Lee!!

B000P5FH3K|5.0|I rented John Grisham's The Rainmaker and i have to say, i enjoyed the movie.    from the very beginning to the end, it was a very thoughtful, well crafted, well acted out movie with a heck of a story line and full of IRONY.    The very title, The Rainmaker almost implies to play God, to dictate circumstances so to speak.     Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a fresh out of law school attorney who sets the tone of his character at the very beginning of the movie when he says that he bartended to go to law school and how unlike other attorneys, he didn't have anything available after finishing law school. No law firms waiting, nothing. He had to look for a job.    Danny DeVito's character is a paralawyer, he finished law school but can't pass the bar exam (6 times failed). He works for a law firm owned by Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke) in Memphis, who in turn, hires Rudy to basically be an ambulance chasing attorney.     DeVito finds out that the law firm they work for is about to get raided by the Government, so he and Damon start their own law firm and quickly start working on the case of Donny, a young 20 something year old kid who is dying of leukemia. He was denied a bone marrow transplant 8 times by the insurance company Great Benefit.    Rudy sues on behalf of Donny's mother and the court action between a rookie fresh out of law school lawyer-just passed the bar exam, and his first ever case and Jon Voit, an experienced trial lawyer is very interesting.    It's Big Coporation vs the little man.     Along the way, Rudy has help from Devito, who is constantly digging up new information, presenting case history to back a ruling, and finding the secretary of one of Great Benefit's executives who claim she \\"resigned\\" and wasn't fired and who can also help expose the truth.    I say The Rainmaker has a double meaning because even though Rudy had the truth on his side, he did do some fancy lawyer tricks with the help of DeVito's character. So they burn the insurance giant and get a ruling of almost $50 million in damages, but...as the title of the movie goes, Great Benefit in turn files for bankruptcy and in the end, nobody really wins.    Donny is gone, Rudy has no income because of the bankruptcy, DeVito leaves his partnership with Rudy, and in the end, Great Benefit lost, won, and then lost again by losing the suit, winning the bankruptcy case, and then going out of business.    it's a very interesting story nonetheless and as a fan of lawyer movies, it's a must see.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Fabulous season! This show is so artfully done; for its violence and gore, it is not in-your-face or gorey for the sake of being gorey. Rather, it is visually intresting. Season two grapples with Dexter's ability reconcile who he is with what others need him to be. Lots of introspection, good character development and plenty of exciting action!
B001E5FYS8|5.0|I loved this movie, and it is a Keeper for me. It is better than I thought that it would be. This man is truly an artist. He has unbelievable balance control and better yet he knows how to stay focused passionately. Just think how much Focus and Confidence you have to have to pursue something like this. Could you do it? I also found the movie extremely interesting showing all of the planning that had to take place to make the event happen. The movie is not really about a Man on a Wire. It is about planning, dreams, passion, goals, developing skills, layout etc... I agree that there were scenes that were staged or reenacted, because they had to be. The actual events are real, and they grabbed me. My only disappointment was that he was arrested for being an artist and not bothering anyone. I can watch this movie again and again. It is Unbelievable and Real.
B001N26GFM|5.0|One of the best movies,it is a differt wy to see history and the second World War. Friendship and other human values are well explain in this movie.
1584233494|4.0|I am and Art major and Artist.  I must say that Shepard Fairey has some great work to show and this book did a great job of doing it.  The book is put together very well and written beautifully!  The book its self is a good sized bood with a great hardbook cover.  It is a black, canvas wrapped hardback with a metallic silver embossing on it.  If you are an art lover, especialy if you are into Urban Art, you will love this book. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Saw this at the theatres, twice.  Girlfriend thought Mr. Jackman was eye candy.  He was dandy.  Liked his character all through the film.  Ms. Kidman seemed a bit thin, physically and acting wise but was adequate to the task.  I could probably see another actress in that role.  Not sure who though.  After we saw it each time we were thinkin', 'Man, I'll betcha there's a DVD release with a director's commentary and maybe outtakes.'  Yea, it was a long film but we were happy with the length and it seemed like the kinda film where there was probably a lotta scenes that the director just couldn't squeeze in.  Really, we wanted even more.  I loved the character of the drunk, very noble, the pathos of the aborigines.  I wondered how the bad guy was gonna get his.  The grandfather aborigine was magnificent, splendid in his knowledge of the land, woven through his spiritual ability to be part of Australia.  My favorite film is Walkabout, by Nicolas Reog, 1971.  There were some similarities, mainly is how well aboriginies were portrayed.  Makes sense that there'd be a half breed generation stolen from their mom's.  Note it wasn't a buncha white women with aborigine men.  Apparently, there were many Native Americans and, of course, Vietnamese, who were children of white American males and native women.  A nation is judged by history over how they handle those children.  This director did a great job weaving in a zing of almost fantasy, portraying the non Western aspects of aborigine culture in a cool way.  Their search for the right boy to play the role really paid off.  We loved how the new release of the Wizard of Oz played into the storyline.  Hay, big movie company, please release a big 'ol version of this flick.  We can't wait.
B00024I31C|5.0|This guy has his own kind of style, and he has consistantly made good albums from the beggining to now.<br /><br />JJ Cale doesn't blow it up with modern production values, its still the same basic ingredients that he's used all along, yet somehow there are these little differences that always keep it fresh. Soft blues, a little grass, cool vocals, and some subtle wits shot through the lyrics. Though the music is never loud or heavy, it still never goes into the realm of what I would consider soft. The Cale is gangsta.yo. You could play this stuff for the fam at dinner, but you could also dig it while you blaze  down the highway.  Its more like something that could put your mind back into place after a bad trip.<br /><br />So, I recommend it. JJ Cale is one of the best songwriters of the times, to me he often seems to be a shadow. nothing wrong with that I suppose, this is a cool bit.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|In Breaking Bad, Bryan Cranston stars as a 50 year old chemistry teacher, who discovers he is in the late stages of lung cancer. He has a wife who is pregnant with their second child, and their first child is a teenager with a physical disability. He learns about all the money made by meth dealers, he figures he can make some quick money before he dies by manufacturing crystal meth. You won't believe the challenges he faces trying to succeed in a world of bad people, when he is such a good person to begin with.     Strongly recommend this series. I was sad to see that it didn't have english subtitles.    I don't know why we had to wait a year for this first season to come out on DVD, and I'm glad the new season has started. I hope I don't have to wait a year for the second season to come out on dvd too, because now I don't have cable, so I have to wait for it to come out on dvd. If you've seen the first season you'll understand the pain i feel in having to wait (hopefully not) two years for the second season to come out on dvd. I can't wait to see what happens next!
B000WGWQG8|4.0|It was great viewing this series,as I did not know much about John Adams ,nor the history of early America.I thought the acting was superb.Fun to see a different side of people,like Benjamin Franklin.It was disturbing watching Adams make love to his wife.Looked awkward.It was also disturbing how they abandoned their kids to boarding school while they went to France for several years.Nicely done series.Didn't want it to end.

6305428387|4.0|Based on the true story of the 1988 Jamaica Olympic bobsled team. How much of the details of the film are actual facts is unknown but it is true that Jamaica did send a four man bobsled team to the 1988 Olympics in Calgary. This is the funny and inspiring story of how it came about, how they got there and what happened once they arrived. I'm not always a big John Candy fan but I think you'll like him in this film. More than just a comedy - I start laughing when I hear Jamaica, Olympic and bobsled all in the same sentence - this is a film about a world class athlete who loses his chance to compete in the Summer Olympics and is determined to get to the Olympics no matter how. What happens when he and John Candy, a former Olympic Gold Medalist in bobsledding for the USA, who is a down and out bookie living in Jamaica, get together is pure fun and magic. While there is no easy way to learn bobsledding in Jamaica, it won't be for lack of trying if they don't. This is the kind of film that Walt Disney built its reputation on. An upbeat soundtrack of Reggae music adds to the film as well as the great scenery. A fun evening for the whole family.
B001GQACGO|1.0|I am a fan of Beyonce, but maybe I am more of a fan of Destiny's Child.  I am not feeling neither CD, I think I found maybe one song that I like, but I was a bit disappointed.
6305910340|5.0|The film is based on the true story of Josh Waitzkin and his family. What happens when a sportswriter, who has just given his son a new baseball glove for his 7th birthday, discovers that his son prefers chess over baseball. He not only prefers it but he is a child prodigy. He could be another Bobby Fischer. Unfortunately, as we see in flashbacks of Fischer's career throughout the film, being a genius and world champion did not necessarily make you a human success story. The question is: are genius and success as a human being mutually exclusive? Can you be a child prodigy and a 'normal' child? The film does a great job of exploring that question as we see the family struggle with first, Josh's gifts, and then, how to best use the incredible talent he has for visualizing the game of chess. As Josh says to one of his opponents during a match, 'It's over. You just don't know it yet.\\" Genius sees things the rest of us mortals do not. The acting is superb, the cinematography, especially of the chess tournaments, is amazing, and the degree to which the film addresses the question of genius versus having a life is sometimes heartbreaking. A film that will challenge you and inspire you. You don't need to be a chess fan or even know anything about the game to enjoy this one. Lu G. for Lu's Reviews.
B001PPGAIA|1.0|The disk arrived promptly but does not work. When put into the DVD player it only makes grinding noises and has no picture at all. Very dissapointing. I have not tried to return it yet. I was ill at the time and had about forgotten about it. I am not happy at all!
B000F3AAUW|4.0|There are some great funk beats and a remix of a classic.    Gnarls definately has talent but his style may not be to everyone's liking.    Personally, I love it!    Yes, I know this review was useless.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|To keep this simple, this film is like art or even opera...either you like it or you don't.  I find this movie to be creative, a visual treat to the eyes (amazing use of color and shawdows)and more, a very tragic tale of life, love, awakening and loss.  Excellent performances and supporting cast was amazing.  If you liked Evita or even Titanic, you are like me, a sucker for tragic love stories.  I believe there are only two original songs for this film and the rest of from many wonderful artist and songs you will know.  If you are going to watch this film for the first time, you may find it confusing or even a bit Corny.  I did the first time, but as the tale went on, I was emotional drawn in by the story and totally believable performances by this excellent cast.  This is a film you must watch more than once to truly understand where it is going.  I have seen this film more than 20 times now because of the emotional connection i feel from it.  I laugh at first and then I am feeling the memory of love as a youth and then...I feel the pain of that once in a life time love, that has ended to soon...<br /><br />If you are a hopeful romantic, you will enjoy this film for many evenings to come and if you don't seem to get it, I feel for your loss...
B000AA4JMU|5.0|I first saw this classic as a little kid and fell in love with it.  As I grew older I found myself longing for it and was never able to find it on any storeshelf, there was always some re-make.    I'm so glad I found it on Amazon, this movie is timeless and is a strong recomendation to anyone who loves the old musicals - I even bought a copy for my mom!    The soundtrack was just a cherry on top.
0385474547|4.0|Thus far, the book seems to be a credible glimpse of West African culture wrapped within a fictional format.  The writing is crisp if at times a little stilted.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|I enjoyed the variety of music contained in this CD; I listen to it on my way to work and enjoy the \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Outlaw Pete\\" very much.  The other pieces are also the type of music that one can listen to again, and again, without tiring of them.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone, Sprinsteen fan, or not.

031606792X|4.0|Reading bad review after bad review here on Amazon would make just about anyone not wish to spend money on this novel.  And each review seems to say the same thing, over and over and over....  There actually is a happy ending to this series... and people are angry about that?      WHAT??    I'm sorry, maybe it's the hopeless romantic dreamer in me, but it is about freaking time that something as epic and tragic as Edward and Bella's love story ends in a perfect happy ending.  I, for one, am tired of seeing these amazing romances and epic loves in books and in movies that end in tragedy.  FINALLY there is an answer to \\"what could have been\\".  I dream, from time to time, happy endings to tragedies like Romeo and Juliet, Catherine and Heathcliff, Antony and Cleopatra, Samson and Delilah, Jack and Rose....    I spent 18 straight hours glued to the pages of this end to an epic story.  I'm actually impressed more with this book than the 3 before it.  I understood that what I was reading was meant to be a \\"teen drama\\", so there was never any expectations to place it upon the shelves of the greats.  The 3 before:  Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse, were entirely way too predictable, I figured some things out CHAPTERS, and in one case, an entire book, before the answers were actually revealed and New Moon just angered me to no end...Bella and Jacob...PUHLEEEZZE...pshh...  Breaking Dawn ACTUALLY HAD ME suprised time and time again, though there were a few predictable outcomes, most of the book kept me on edge.  Literally.  Heart palpatating and sweaty palms.    The only flaw I found in the book is the only reason I did not award this book 5 stars.  Jacob imprinting on Renesmee.  I believe the story would have been MUCH better served to have Jacob imprint on one of the visiting vampires.      This book is the best in the series and more than worth your hard earned cash.  I could honestly have lived entirely happy to read Twilight, skipping New Moon and Eclipse, then finish with Breaking Dawn.      Here is to hoping that more epic and tragic love stories find their happy endings.
1589944607|5.0|I am by no means a board game afficianado, and the first time I played this particulair game I'd never seen a single episode of the show. I was assured this wouldn't detract from my enjoyment and proceded to play.<br /><br />After a few rounds to figure out the rules (they can be a little daunting at first but with an experienced player or having someone who has at least read the rule book before the other players arrive- the game is quite managable) we were off and flying and having a great time. The game has a good deal of strategy, risk, and lucky die rolls to keep most people happy. This was also one of the first co-operative board games I've played and the team-work aspects and the secrecy and suspicion really keep things exciting. The game in itself is very interesting and in fact, got me into the show which I now enjoy as well.<br /><br />After playing it I sought it out and have played it a few times since (whenever I'm able really) and always enjoy it. The game is tough, interesting, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. An all around fun way to spend a few hours!
1592402690|4.0|Wandering through my Beatles collection is a much richer experience after reading this book. Before Emerick's first record, Revolver, they were recorded in the same, stiffly regulated way as every other band. 19-year-old Emerick risked his job at EMI to throw the rules out the window from the very first song he engineered for them, the awesome \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\"    It was Emerick's creativity and rule-breaking that elevated the band to the revolutionary recording phenomenon that they became. He was the first engineer to ever close-mic a drumset and the first to use loops and samples in the way we take for granted today. He invented vocal and instrument sounds that had never been heard before, in an age where everything had to be done physically and painstakingly. Hearing how he approached each song and session is vastly educational, inspiring and surprisingly random - wait 'til you read how the brass section after \\"And the baaaaaaand begins to play\\" in Yellow Submarine was put together!    Of course, there's a few insights into the band themselves (he's not the biggest Harrison fan), the craziness that surrounded them, the bizarre presence of Yoko and the gradual breakdown of relationships that's well documented elsewhere. But first and foremost, it's an insight into the environment, the technology and the creative thinking that went into some of my favourite recordings.
0375842209|5.0|So many books are written about The Holocaust and the atrocities of the Nazis on the persecuted Jewish population.   This book however, is written about a young girl adopted by a poor German couple and their lives while World War 2 rages around them... A different and sad perspective on The War showing how The common Germans lived their lives during the turmoil.  If you liked \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\", you'll love this.
0439023483|5.0|I love YA and Middle Grade Novels. I write them, so I read a lot of them. I usually go for fantasy stories, but something about Hunger Games caught my eye. I read the first chapter online and had to rush to the library to find this book. It's WONDERFUL. Very touching and thought-provoking about what happens when part of a society gains too much power over another. Especially if that powerful part has no moral guidance other than itself. I actually cried during one scene. I think just about any kid could get into this... the idea of children being forced to fight to the death as a punishment for their ancestors rebelling against tyranny. Very awesome... with plenty of action to balance out the emotion.
6305907145|4.0|I love Mansfield Park both as a book and as a movie. This version followed along more closely to the actual story as Jane Austen wrote it. It is a well made movie with a wonderful cast. Ms. Frances O'Connor protrayed Fanny Price quite well. I love watching this movie over and over again.
B001GV09FS|5.0|This soundtrack was absolutely fantastic! The only thing that disappointed me was the the song \\"Waterloo\\" was not on it!  I listen to this frequently! It is so upbeat!
0765348780|5.0|The strongest element of this book is the characters. They are extremely well-developed and seem to come alive on the page. Many of them are sympathetic and Erikson has imbued them with a sense of humor. The action moves quickly and although there is considerable violence, it is less than in some other series I've read. The story is basically about one unit of an army and its trials and tribulations, not only military but political as well.<br /><br />The book is divided into threads but fortunately there is only one thread per chapter. This is good because it is not evident what the overall story is or what Erikson is trying to communicate. Adding to the texture of the story but also to the confusion, is the amazing development of various cultures and folklores. Fortunately Erikson also provides a cast of characters and a glossary but these are of only limited value.<br /><br />If the reader can set aside some of the confusion and is willing to wait for other books in the series for some clarification, then the reader will be treated to an amazing story, one that is well worth the time. This is one of the best fantasy books I have ever read.
B001UAVNVO|5.0|Well if you are a Lamb of God fan, i would recommend you to buy this release, cause it contains everything a fan would dream off, a Vinyl LP witch is just awesome cause of the sound quality, the normal CD, an extra CD with the Studio experience, each track split up in vocals, bass, guitar and drums, an finally the USB key with both CD's on it and 2 Bonus Tracks.  It just looks good next to all the other Lamb of God CD Releases.
031606792X|5.0|What is not to love?  Suspense, action, love, and  a happy ending.  The whole series was incredible.  The last novel was no less enchanting.  I did not  know how we would be able to let Bella and Edward go  but this story brought all the lose ends together  with a cresecendo of feelings that all is well with   the Cullens.  Love. Love. Love it.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I originally submitted a good review for this product to the seller but have changed my opinion completely as the dvd is terrible condition and I cannot even use it because it skips and gets stuck every 15 seconds. It is not dirty just damaged and it was a waste of my money!!!
B000M53GM2|5.0|GoldenEye is one of the better runs in the infamous James Bond franchise for many reasons.  To start off, this is one of the few 007 adventures combining camp, humor, and gritty realism all in one while still providing the amazing set-pieces you would have come to expect from the original Bond films.  This is a new flavor for James Bond, yet has enough home touches that it feels right at home in the series.<br /><br />Being the 17th entry in the never-ending series revolving around the British super agent this film had a lot of history to live up to, but under the direction of Martin Campbell (who would later comeback to direct the superb Bond film Casino Royale) this is one of the most fun and thrilling entries in the entire series.  There is homage to the original Bond films, but this film also takes full liberties to make itself an entirely new, refreshing entry in the franchise.<br /><br />Tina Turner provides the vocals for a very classy opening song (with lyrics and music written by Bono and The Edge).  As far as \\"Classic Bond Songs\\" go I can say that over the last fifteen years this is by far the most classic Bond song ('You Know My Name' from Casino Royale is my favorite, but it lacks the characteristics of a \\"classic Bond\\" song).  The opening montage that goes to the song is also on of the most intricate, visually fascinating ones I have seen in ANY Bond film and really gets the audience pulled in.<br /><br />Okay, now that the little aspects of this film are out of the way Let's take a look at the things that really make this a special entry in the 007 Franchise.  This is the film also brought in a new Bond in the form of Pierce Brosnan, who plays the part exceptionally well.  Brosnan brings wit and charm to the role like a mixture of Connery and Moore with his own twist added in.  This Bond is cool-headed, but when confronted with the thoughts his own actions it becomes apparent that Brosnan's Bond is a man who hides lots of feelings under his cool façade.<br /><br />The villain of this film is something you'd think the Bond franchise would have done before and that is the concept of a MI6 agent who is a friend of Bond going rogue.  Alec Trevelyan (006) is played by actor Sean Bean and makes for a particularly cold, and coolheaded villain who being someone who knows Bond close gives dialogue that you have never heard before in any other Bond film.<br /><br />\\"I might as well ask if all those vodka martinis silence the screams of all the men you've killed...or if you've found forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women, for all the dead ones you failed to protect.\\"<br /><br />That is what Trevelyan says in this film that you have probably have never thought of before when watching James Bond.  This is one of the defining aspects of GoldenEye because it is one of the few Bond films that effectively asks the question \\"Who is James Bond, and why does he do what he does? How does he live with himself?<br /><br />Of course the villains aren't the only ones confronting Bond with this question.  Even Bond's girl of the movie turns against his charm to question his attitude and his actions.  Natalya (Izabella Scorupco) goes so far as to ask Bond why he's so cold, to which Bond replies with an emotionless stare: \\"It's what keeps me alive.\\"  In the days of Connery he'd never be asked that, and he would never reply in such a manner, which shows a more human aspect of Bond's humanity.  It is modern and somewhat shocking to see Bond, one of the greatest icons on cinema be asked these questions and it allows the audience to actually sympathize with the lovable character who has always manages to spend time in casinos, shoot bad guys, escape from exotic traps, and make it out safe and with the girl.<br /><br />GoldenEye is one of the best entries in the James Bond franchise, and Peirce Brosnan makes for one of the best Bonds I have ever seen and it is really a shame that in his later films he wasn't provided the proper scripts that would have allowed him to truly leave his mark on the franchise.  It is a shame that Campbell didn't do any more of the entries with Brosnan, but he did bring us the brilliant Casino Royale.ark on the franchise.  It is a shame that Campbell didn't do any more of the entries with Brosnan, but he did bring us the brilliant Casino Royale.
1931955085|5.0|Beautiful book.  Vibrant clear color.  Thoroughly covers the Tree show with tons of detail.  A must have for any Mark Ryden fan
B0014I4KIK|5.0|This is the best thing I've heard in a very long time. The use of a full studio orchestra reminds me of the Dusty Springfield, Pet Clark era, but then her voice - oh her voice, so sorrowful at times, sassy at times tells of a woman who is determined not to be broken by a man. Young people are freaking over this little Brit, but I'm 58 and I'm with them. I love every song on Rockferry. I can't get enough.
0446579939|5.0|I have loved all of Nicholas Sparks books that I have read so far and The Lucky One is no disappointment.  The story unfolds in a very understandable way and Sparks makes it difficult to put the book down.  I usually find some books predictable, but I was kind of surprised by the ending.

0780021967|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A thoroughly delightful film, The 39 Steps is a sucessful mixture of suspense, humor, and romance as only Hitchcock could deliver; also interesting in the way that it foreshadows later films of the Master like North by Northwest, it's a film to watch or own.
B001G0MFOM|1.0|It's so disgusting that I'm having trouble writing how disgusted and POORLY the last season was written.  The big exec's must have really said \\"end it now\\" for the producer to do such a crappy job.  She must know that we won't forget what she did if she puts out a movie or attempt another series.  Such a disservice to the actors who took a chance on the series and to leave in that fashion........ ARGH!  poor....very poor.  Actually I thought the series really took a dive after season 4.  I got bored with the season 5 jenny's movie thing.  It showed true L word fashion in the last 2-3 episodes.  I'm really having a hard time justifying buying season 5 and 6....except to show how it went down hill fast.  I would like to know the REAL reason they ended the series....drama perhaps!?
0800141660|1.0|I did manage to see the whole drama but it was slow and boring. The pictures were sometimes interesting. Nice country side. Not worth spending 2.25 hours on it unless you play guitar at same time...

B001FB55MG|5.0|Fantastic movie for all, extremely funny. Make believe with that makes you believe it's real, what a sequence of events.
B001EM1E94|3.0|I waited over a year for a chance to see this film, and when the opportunity finally arose, I was sadly disappointed.  A strange disjointedness takes over and for those who haven't read the books - there is no hope to follow the tale.  For those who have read the books - they are changed, warped and some of our favorite parts are removed.<br /><br />Though \\"Hogfather\\" was no awardwinner, it was faithful to the book and held a certain charm that lovers of the series will be thrilled with.  The Color of Magic sadly lacks this charm.  Through no fault of the excellent cast - Discworld never comes to life in this film.  Perhaps it is the rushed condensing of two books into one film, or perhaps it is as simple as Pratchett's humor not translating properly to the new medium.<br /><br />Each of the characters seems close enough to what we envisioned... but they seem to wander hopelessly through the scenery with little direction and even less purpose.  Important scenes like - the trolls on the mountain are cut down to almost nothing with no explination at all.  When Cohen finally gets his dentures, there is no reason for them to sparkle because it is never said that troll's teeth are made of diamonds.  The luggage is almost forgotten and becomes simply a mobile set piece.  The scenes at the Dragon's castle are pointless and the concept of the imaginary dragons coming to life is passed over completely - making the disappearance of the dragon rather odd to the viewer.  The scene with Bel Sham Haroth is completely left out, as well as the card game with Twoflower, War, Famine, Pestilence and Death.<br /><br />In all, the scenes with the greatest opportunities for humor were cut, and those that were left were patched together with no rhyme or reason.  Sadly I cannot recommend this movie, though avid Discworld fanatics will still go out of their way to watch it... just know that there is not a lot here to cling to.<br /><br />Easily a PG rating - my 7 year old watched it with us and seemed to enjoy it, though he didn't ask if we could \\"keep it\\" like he normally does.gh he didn't ask if we could \\"keep it\\" like he normally does.

1590200918|3.0|This is a well-written (until the end) little trifle, but that's all it is. I like the style, but it isn't nearly as scary as the jacket would have you believe. In fact, I read it in a thunderstorm last night -- yes, it's a very quick read -- and, upon finishing it, went down to my dark, stone basement to do the laundry. I agree with the other reviewers: It plays like that old TV episode with Roddy MacDowell and the changing picture (Was that on Dark Shadows?), but the TV version was far scarier. Still, a quick, fun read.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD.  It's the only thing I listen to in my car.  All the music is great, but Rob's song \\"Never Think\\" is unbelievable.  Can't wait until he makes a CD of his own.  I'll be the first in line to buy!!    Wendy
B001N18HOQ|3.0|They left out some stuff on the dvd:  The part where Vedder asks if another guy named Eddie was able to get in, the speech after Black, the part where Eddie says his polaroid is in the shop, and Rockin In The Free World.  Don't know why those parts were taken out.  The Deluxe Edition would have been better this way:   disc 1 (demos), disk 2 (rough mixes), disc 3 unplugged (on a cd; the whole concert), disc 4 (the whole mtv unplugged).
031606792X|5.0|Bought this book for my granddaughter, but I have been reading the series along with her.  We have both enjoyed all four books.  Once you begin you just can not put these books down.
B0002SROT0|4.0|I've recently begun listening to Elliot Smith and this is my first CD to own.  It's quite good and I am anticipating acquiring more music from Mr. Smith.
0440244870|1.0|This book is pure, fluffy chick lit.  I figured that going in, but I was looking forward to a little junk food for my brain.  I thought this book was very similar to Bridgette Jones' Diary, but not nearly as good. Most chick lit centers on a slightly neurotic female character that the reader grows to love despite her flaws.  I didn't feel the least bit sympathetic to Rebecca Bloomwood.  The current recession could have something to do with why I had no sympathy for someone who can't control her spending and lies to cover it up.  The book is full of lots of references to designer clothing and chic London shops.  Other than that, the plot is extremely predictable and left me feeling like I'd wasted the $8 that I spent on buying the book.
0393324818|4.0|I breezed through this. It artfully explains the \\"new\\" approach used by the Oakland A's to build a playoff caliber team.  Serves as a critique on the backwards way most baseball teams are run. Which can be seen as a metaphor for the many corporations who are failing because of their archaic methods.    This is well written, and the author is very good at getting inside the heads of the major characters.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I received this item in excellent condition and faster than I expected!  I would definitly order from this vendor again with no reservations!  I also feel the price was very reasonable.  Thank you.
B001DEVZUG|5.0|It has been incredible to watch Annie Lennox evolve into the superstar she has become.  With the Eurythmics, although I thought she was great, I had no idea if she would last.  But each album has been better than the one before.  This collection allows you to get a hint of just how good she's gotten.
B001NFNFNA|4.0|Excellent acting in this movie.  A little lacking in cinematography, or maybe my expectations were higher than they should have been.  Not for the weak of heart.
B001KL3GWM|4.0|If you love soulful and bluesy swamp rock, you're going to really enjoy \\"Already Free\\" by the Derek Trucks Band.  The CD is extremely listenable with a good solid groove.      My favorites:    Already Free -- got a serious soul groove going here, as he says \\"gonna be like Christmas when the Devil comes for me\\"     Days is Almost Gone -- this is more rocking rhythmn    Down Don't Bother Me -- great cheer up song and the message is right on, if the music's good, down just doesn't both you    Rebecca Kyle, March 2009
B001E95ZHY|4.0|This is a moderately long film that has a decent stupid funny laugh about every 15 minutes.<br /><br />Rainn Wilson is gross as the sweaty schlub uncle who shows off his belly and butt frequently. This is not a heavy metal movie; anyone that expects that would be sorely disappointed. Come on, Rainn Wilson as a drummer in a rock band, and somebody expects that to be a heavy metal movie? It's not \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" by a long margin. It's not \\"Almost Famous.\\" It's one of those silly movies where the geek kids conquer the world. We've seen this a hundred times, the band appears on stage and instantaneously the crowd goes crazy and loves their music. And the band wins whatever they were competing for - the girl, the money, the prize, whatever.<br />If a person accepts this film as an \\"underdogs win\\" movie, and a bit of Three Stooges humor, and some decent laughs thrown in; they will enjoy this film.<br /><br />The music is just kind of OK. Amelia (Emma Stone) never learned how to play the bass, sing, or really move like somebody in a band. So she is forgettable during the band performances. However, she is a decent actress and does well the rest of the time. The others look reasonably good during band performances.<br /><br />The movie is decent funny for a Saturday or Friday night of escapism. It's kind of a guy film (you know Stooges humor). It's PG-13, on the rough side of PG-13. Rainn Wilson is naked or in his underwear quite a bit. There's some rough language. No violence, absolutely no murders or slashed up people anywhere. And the humor is a bit crude off and on. It's probably not appropriate for younger viewers.<br /><br />The DVD is just the movie and previews. No special features.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This may be the only film that is blatantly anti-Christian that I still give a high rating, simply because it was so entertaining. Hopefully, some of the religious digs were tongue-in-cheek and not meant in a mean-spirited way, but I'm not sure, especially considering the Coen Brothers made it.    The music in here is super, led by the catchy \\"Man Of Constant Sorrow,\\" performed by Dan Tyminski. I also loved \\"Soggy Bottom Boys\\" humorously sang and presented by the three main characters: George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Those three guys were hilarious, particularly Nelson with his rubber-faced looks. Audibly, the entire soundtrack is outstanding, under the direction of T-Bone Burnett. I wound up buying the CD as millions of other people did. Fantastic music.    The way this was filmed makes it visually fascinating, with scenery enhanced by computer graphics and all-time great Roger Deakins in charge of the photography. All the people in this movie are wacky, as are the people who made it. The parade of wild characters, wild scenes one after the other and the three likable leads (yeah, even excessive abuser of the Lord's name in vain Clooney) make this an extremely fast-moving 103-minute movie.
B000002UAU|4.0|When this album came out, there was nothing like it in the world that you could compare it to.  Everyone went bananas, including myself.  But, I still don't think it's their best.  Before you start flaming, I think I simply overdosed myself on this record.  I prefer \\"Rubber Soul\\" or \\"Revolver\\" or the \\"White\\" to SPLHCB, but it does stand out on it's own.  \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" were part of these sessions, as well, so it started the Beatles down a path that I really love.  I just burnt myself out.  BTW, if you find a copy of this album IN MONO, it's a far, far superior listening experience.  Back in 1967 (and before)  they spent most of their time mixing down to one monaural channel and the balancing tricks they had for mono were amazing.  How can you really get any separation on one track???  You can imagine the many hours that went into it.  Surprisingly, hardly any time was spent on stereo mixdown and that function was usually handed off to an engineer or some Abbey Road pee-on.  Get the mono version, if you can find it.  (And no - it's not the same as putting a \\"balance\\" control to center on a stereo recording. That just knocks everything out of phase.  The mono mix is entirely different - and better).
B000AP04NI|4.0|Overall, this is a refreshing nice old-fashioned musical and a visual treat as well. I really liked the first part of this movie best with all the famous songs and great color that looks even better on DVD....and just a great feel of old-time wholesomeness.    The story is just about two romances: the main \\"contest:\\" Gordon McCrae and Rod Steiger both vying for Shirley Jones, and the minor one with Gloria Grahame and two suitors. Grahame, with her humor as \\"Ado Annie Carnes\\" is the best character in the film, at least to me. Eddie Albert also chips in with some humor as the \\"peddler\\" and Charlotte Greenwood was good as \\"Aunt Eller.\\"    Jones and McCrae are about as \\"All-American\\" as you can get and Steiger is the lone \\"villain\\" of the film. The most colorful segment of the movie was the dream scene that featured a great set.    If I could change anything with this film, I'd reduce it in length down to two hours, which is plenty.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|This was totally worth every penny, you can watch them over and over again without getting sick of it! I wish i would have sprung for the blue ray version instead though.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|perfect condition, exactly what i needed, and at a great price, fast shipping as well
B000059TEQ|4.0|I read the book and saw the movie many years ago (over 30 years, I think), but decided I wanted to read it again AND see the movie too.  The book is very sad, but it's a great love story.  The movie follows the book pretty closely and Ryan O'Neil and Ali Magraw were really good.  It is an old movie, but I like old movies and I like love stories SO I really enjoyed this.
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|There are apparently two types of musicals...ones where there is a solid story and the actors sing a song every now and then...and ones where there is like only five minutes of dialogue before the next song began. This movie is in the latter group.  I hate musicals like that!  I tried to forward through all the songs, but it was obviously a hopeless cause. Not that I don't like ABBA songs, I do!  In fact, that's why I stopped watching this movie in the first half hour; I was afraid if I continued, I would end up deleting all of the ABBA songs from my iPod, and smashing all of my ABBA CDs.<br /><br />The funny thing is I was watching this DVD as a break from three other DVDs I have been watching for two weeks--the mini-series \\"Holocaust\\", which was one of Meryl Streep's first works. I thought it would be nice to see her in a happy movie in a happy place in a happy time.  Much to my dismay, I ended up rather seeing her in a Jewish ghetto in WWII Europe!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Just a short background, my girlfriend who normally does not like scifi movies loved this. The movie itself is as she described \\" cute and fun to watch, wish I saw it in the cinema first \\". Now I'm a fan of the series itself so I will not be objective here but aside from the story itself the quality of the transfer is very good and is blue ray worthy, with good sound as well ( I have a full 5.1 setup, I'll add the 2 rears when more movies support it ). Small niggles are the wish for a longer space battle sequence and more extras, some may even want more bloopers.<br /><br />Unlike most other scifi's this one does not go into wizz bang techie gizmo world but has a feel of realism, the low budget does show but in a good way of how well one can make a low budget movie as there are very many hi cost block busters that are not as well done. It does feel a little like a season finale rather than a movie if your a fan but then again it was meant to end the series off.<br /><br />So recommended for anyone and a worthy addition to any bluray collection, Just wish it did better in the cinema so we could have had another movie.
0786838655|5.0|In our family, we cheer when a new Rick Riordan book comes out. We rush to the store and we buy it.<br /><br />We heard that if we liked Harry Potter we would like this series. We liked Harry Potter. We LOVED this book. In fact, my son, age 9, thought that The Lightning Thief was better than Harry Potter.<br /><br />This is a fast moving book about a young man named Percy Jackson. He has never quite fit in and never quite understood why strange things happen to him. One day though, it all becomes clear.<br /><br />Percy is the son of a Greek God. He is a Hero in the truest sense of the word (a son of a God). His father is Persues and is charge of the water. Because of this, Percy also has some special abilities. He can control water, breath underwater and he is stronger in water.<br /><br />While Percy is discovering his abilities, he finds his way to Camp Half Blood. The place he can learn more about who he is and practice using his new skills. He runs into other interesting characters that are similar to him. Percy also gets to battle monsters and strange beings.<br /><br />My two oldest children, ages 8 and 9 at the time, loved this book. I enjoyed this book. It is true, if you like Harry Potter, this is a good book to try reading. If you like learning about Greek myths, Greek Gods and so on, this is a great book.<br /><br />Well worth the money.<br />Enjoy.

B000KIPT30|5.0|Four stereo preamps/amps in one small package for $29.95 with free shipping. I'm only using one of the stereo channels, but it's still a great product and a bargain. I bought two to use as booster preamps. I'm using one to boost the stereo line level output from a TV/Monitor to a self-powered loudspeaker/subwoofer system. The second unit is being used to boost the stereo headphone output from a notebook computer to a self-powered loudspeaker/subwoofer system. They are both working out perfectly. The uses for this product are only limited by your imagination.  If needed, Parts Express sells gold-plated 1/4\\" stereo male To 3.5mm stereo female adapters, part number 091-1025, for $2.15 each.
B0001I561E|5.0|I bought this movie for my three year old daughter. I had been looking everywhere, for this Movie! If it weren't for Amazon.com, I wouldn't know what to do. Now we watch this movie everyday.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|I understand why many were disappointed with this movie.  For one thing, the action sequences are particularly hard to follow; 007 almost always engages multiple targets and it's really hard to see exactly what is happening, and to whom it is happening.  All that aside, though, the plot was believable and enjoyable.  Craig's 007 is very businesslike, not much given to small talk, but I believe he is right up there with Connery.  Judi Dench is wonderful.  I definitely plan to watch this one again.
B001BTG3OQ|4.0|This SB900 are easier to use and work pretty well. I'm a wedding photographer and I shoot quiet a bit in ISO 400 and 800. So I keep the power of the speedlight in normal TTL or adjust it in the same mode but with   -0.7. It has overheated a couple of times, but I HAVE TWO OF THEM. So, as soon as it started getting a little overheated (not even started beeping) I change my flash, and problem solved!    I`ve had 4, SB800 before this.  For just over a year later of two o them, I started experiencing a serious problem with the units: while using the speedlight on an wedding I started noticing and increasing problem with underexposure until it completely stopped firing. The unit does switch on and the ready light also lights up however no matter what means I used to trigger the speedlight, that is, manually or mounted on camera or even as a slave/remote flash unit it does not fire at all though the ready light blinks every time the unit is triggered. I have used the same SB800 on different Nikon digital cameras (D100, D70 and D300s, also Fuji S3pro) but it does not make any difference, the problem persisted.    This is when I bought the SB900, and that is why I bought two. I think it had to do with the overheating, because my SB800 where used pretty hard. So even if the SB900 did not stopped itself before it burns I STRONGLY RECOMMEND NO TO LET IT GO OVER WITH THE HEATING SO THEY WOULD LAST MUCH LONGER.    In SUMMARY: get two SB900 and work stress free of the heating.

0307387178|3.0|Jon Krakauer is a masterful writer, and this story is compelling and brilliantly told. I read it in little more than one sitting.     Unfortunately, as an expert on edible wild plants, I readily recognized that the author's death scenario that concludes the book--having Chris die from swainsonine poisoning caused by eating Hedysarum alpinum seeds (in later printings the story is changed to say that these seeds are moldy)--is ridiculous. It is nothing more than a rendition of a pre-existing fable about death by plant poisoning. There is absolutely no evidence that this ever happened; in fact, it is demonstrably impossible. First, the Hedysarum that Chris ate (and the one that he didn't eat, H. mackenziei), are not toxic. The seeds and other parts of the plant have been thoroughly tested for toxicity. In fact, I have eaten them myself, and they are delicious. The chemical swainsonine, which Krakauer claims killed Chris, has been known for decades to not be found in these plants. And the moldy seeds? Give me a break. There is absolutely no evidence that Chris ate or even had any moldy seeds. Furthermore, this mold, Rhizoctonia leguminicola, is not known from this region, nor is it known to colonize the plant Chris ate. But perhaps most importantly, any person knowledgeable on the subject can see that Chris was NOT showing the symptoms of swainsonine poisoning. What amazes me is that Krakauer got a free pass--nobody called him on this yellow journalism--even though his fanciful story contradicts the official conclusion made by the medical authorities.    Not a single person who has seriously investigated this case gives Krakauer's acount of Chris's death any credibility whatsoever. What a shame that it has become the accepted \\"truth.\\" We'd be better served by the real story.    The book is insightful and well written, but I cannot look past the egregious journalistic malpractice.
B000059TFO|4.0|This is a type of movies you should watch at least once to make a step towards to getting a comprehensive view at the american cinema or expand your present one if you're one of those who always crave for a real good stuff.   The movie is bit long but it's worth to watch. If you possess some basic knowledge of what was happening during the era of civil rights, you would enjoy seeing the actual based-on-the-true-events scenes and comparing it to the present time. Living in the South and witnessing the black culture that becomes so popular, it has been so unusual to get a snap-shot of some 40 years ago.
0810970686|5.0|Both my son Tyler and I are big fans of Jeff Kinney and this series! There are few published books that I have come across that both a parent and their child can read together with equal enjoyment. Mr. Kinney's 'Diary of A Wimpy Kid' series does just that .... and it allows my son to understand just how cool reading can be!!!!  So, a little suggestion .... read this series with your child or children .... you will both enjoy doing so together.
B001N26GFC|1.0|I can't say much about this film, as I write this I am still suffering through the film...  I was surprised by how many 5 stars there are for this movie.  The first ten minutes of a movie is the most important.  Here you are to set up the plot and give the audience a reason to care about the people in the story.  Happy go lucky spends the first 10 minutes effectively boring the audience, ignoring the plot all together.  I'm 47 minutes into the movie now and still wondering what the story is, where the plot is?  15 minutes into the movie we have seen Poppy, the lead character of the movie, annoy a bookkeeper, dance at a concert with her girlfriends, get drunk, get High and make a bird mask out of a paper bag and not say anything understandable.  20 mins in we discover this party girl is a elementary school teacher!  Just what I want for my kid, a teacher who gets drunk and high on her weekends.<br /><br />30 mins in she gets a driving lesson from a complete jerk.  (why she is 30 and not driving yet who knows...)  But of course if I was her instructor I'd probably yell at her too... I'd probably gag her with duct tape or something...<br /><br />I'm not going to go on... this is the worst indie film I've ever seen.  I don't care about any of the characters, heck I don't even know who they are or what is going on in any of their lives.  Poppy just laughs at everything and makes inappropriate jokes about everything.  She has to be the most annoying person on earth.  This is not a film worth watching and I'm not sure why those above liked it.  I found it mostly annoying and at this point I'm not sure why I'm still watching it.  Don't buy it, rent it if you must but don't waste your money on this one.<br /><br />If you want to buy a good indie film go for Boy In Stripped Pajamas.

B000O78KW4|5.0|Man, I was watching this movie the other day and I can't believe how good this movie is. Even though I liked Die Harder, it lacked the brains of its predecessor. John McTiernan returned to give us an action flick that not only delivers as an action flick but is also quite effective as a thriller.<br /><br />Simon Peter Gruber(Jeremy Irons) is the brother of Hans Gruber who was killed by McClane in the Nakatomi Plaza. He detonates a few bombs in New York City and sends McClane on \\"Fools Errands\\" while covering up his real scheme: to steal gold reserves. McClane is saved from an a**kicking by angry mob by Zeus Carver(Samuel L Jackson), a shop owner. They reluctantly team up to play along with Simon's games. They later find out his big scheme all along.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson and Bruce Willis have excellent chemistry together. Plus you have to admire the match up. Zeus Carver has a nationalistic mentality and John McClane is your not-so-average white-bread cop. Despite their differences they still get together to handle the same goal.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons is magnificent as Simon Peter Gruber. He's definitely one of the best movie villains in history. His plan showed a clever genius absent from movie villains nowadays. Quite possibly the last serious role that Jeremy Irons had. Tell the truth, can you look at him with a straight face after he starred in Dungeons and Dragons? I think not.<br /><br />I like the pacing of this movie too. It keeps you glued to the screen and provides a thrill ride from start to finish. Im kind of surprised that this movie didn't do so well at the box office when everybody knows that its better than Die Hard 2. Plus this movie has lowest score of all Die Hard movies on Rottentomatoes. Shows you just how much these snooty consensus followers really know.<br /><br />If you're looking for an action/thriller that doesnt disappoint you cant go wrong with Die Hard With A Vengeance. It has great acting, a superb villain, a good plot and some engaging action sequences. More effective than what passes for Thriller these days and is easily the most underrated action sequel of all time.e than what passes for Thriller these days and is easily the most underrated action sequel of all time.
B00005G54M|5.0|Whether you like Michael Jackson or not, this C.D. is a record engineer's wet dream. Quincy Jones is one of the greatest record producers of all time. Not only does the C.D. have one great song after another, but in SACD, it's a deeply religious experience! Two gloved thumbs up.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have bad knees from years' old repeat injuries. Jillian is a great motivator and this is a killer workout. However, I can't do a lot of the leg work because it's all jumping and squats (both of which my physical therapist says can't do anymore without causing permanent damage). If your knees will take it, you'll blast off the pounds with this one. As for me, I'll be figuring out modifiers for a while, because Jillian doesn't offer any. She assumes that overweight people are merely overweight and not also injured. True for some, but not all of us.
B001FBSMW6|2.0|Perfect Symmetry is the latest CD from British pop rock artists Keane.  I bought this CD based on hearing the clips available on the product page, but unfortunately this is not a CD where the samples were a good indicator of how I would like the CD.  By the time I had gotten to the third track \\"Better Than This\\", it was about ready to roll down my window and throw the CD out of the car.<br /><br />The opener \\"Spiralling\\" starts off with annoying synth and shouts of \\"Ooo!\\" make for a grating start to both the song and the CD.  It gets better, but only marginally so.  \\"The Lovers Are Losing\\" is better, but it only makes its way up to OK.  It is unoffensive but bland.  However, \\"Better Than This\\" takes things back down in a hurry.  The opening sounds like something out of a spaceship - yuck!  The next track \\"You Haven't Told Me Anything\\" brings things back to mediocre, but nothing more.  Not until the fifth song \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" is there anything worth listening to.  The vocal hooks on this song are incredible, but that only makes the opening tracks that much more frustrating.  It shows that when Keane plays it closer to the vest that they are actually a very capable piano driven pop rock band.  Other worthwhile songs include the mid-tempo \\"Again And Again\\" and the slower \\"Playing Along\\" and \\"Black Burning Heart\\".<br /><br />Overall, Perfect Symmetry is a disappointment that just bombs.  Keane teases us with the title track, but otherwise leave the listener unfulfilled.  This is definitely a CD where you are better off finding the few song with potential and downloading the mp3s.<br /><br />Download this:  Perfect Symmetry
B000002KAT|5.0|Van has a number of perfect albums, and it makes no sense to compare them head-to-head.  Is this better than Moondance or St. Dominic's Preview?  Maybe, but each is such a different creature that I think it's worthless to make those sorts of evaluations.  The fairest I can say to all of those works is that they are all perfect, but this is a little more perfect.    There are many great reviews of this album, and I don't know what to add.  Every time I hear this album, it challenges me in new and different ways.  Every song on this album is a \\"10\\" and it's hard to pick a favorite, though Ballerina edges out the rest for me by a smidge.  Also, peer-reviewed scientific studies have shown that playing this for your baby in the womb will make it smarter!    A caveat, and I know I'll attract ire for this--I already have over at that message board.  This album was recently \\"remade\\" by Van.  Stick with the original.  It has withstood the tests of time.  I have some serious doubts Astral Weeks II will.
B000059XUT|5.0|The DVD came on time as promised.  I love this movie.  It's hysterical!  I saw it when it first came out originally, but I never forgot it.  OMG it's hilarious!
B000E97X66|5.0|Bruuuuuuuuce has gone through a number of transformations. I'll confess I don't like all of them, although I do admire his continued attempts at growth as an artist.    This album was when he was first on the cusp of greatness, and if you listen, you'll know why. This album features many of the great works from his masterpiece second and third albums--and it MAKES masterpieces out of several initially underwhelming pieces from the first. The band is featured in ways it rarely would again. There are some significant reinventions, some great jams.    Most crucially of all, it is tremendously raw. You can hear the hecklers, the scratchiness of Bruce's voice, the occasional bad attempt at improv banter, the screech of the mic. Bruce is great live, but his other live albums don't translate the energy. This is a marvel precisely because it is so vulnerable, so unpolished in spots.    The definitive live album from Bruce, and probably among the top 5 live albums from anyone. Particular gems are For You (which sends shivers down my spine), Sandy, Kitty's Back, E Street Shuffle, Spirit in the Night, and Lost in the Flood. Even She's the One, which I think is a dud of a song, doesn't sound half-bad here.    The timbre of the instrumentation is great, too. Roy and Steve in particular shine.
184718877X|5.0|`A legal and literary genius': such is the picture of Lord Sumner that emerges from this very scholarly, as well as readable and thought provoking biography.  By all accounts John Andrew Hamilton, Lord Sumner (1859-1934) was a powerhouse of a man; one of those formidable figures in the law who, in the words of Lord Bingham, `forged the legal traditions which we have been privileged to inherit and enjoy.'<br /><br />No longer widely known, this often controversial law lord was legendary in his time.  By chance, as the author Antony Lentin points out, 2009 marks the 150th anniversary of Sumner's birth, the 75th of his death, the centenary of his promotion to the Bench, the 80th anniversary of his last year on the Bench and the 90th of his secondment to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, in a move described as unparalleled for a law lord.  He was apparently accused by John Maynard Keynes as being largely responsible for the heavy financial penalties exacted following the Conference against a defeated Germany.<br /><br />Such controversy (as well as approval) occasioned by his strong views and forceful utterances was not untypical of his life.  Few, however, questioned his standing.  In 1934, the year of his death, one, Sir Louis Stuart, referred to him as `one of the greatest lawyers who ever advised or argued, and one of the greatest judges who ever decided a cause.'<br /><br />Characterising Lord Sumner as `the last political law lord' is apt.  He defined the prevailing convention - which still prevails - that law lords should be seen and not heard on matters political, expressing his views with clarity and force on such sensitive issues as the General Strike of 1926, the Irish Settlement and later the issue of Indian independence, which he did not support.<br /><br />Committed as he was, to the reform of the House of Lords, he would have been interested, if not altogether approving, of the changes that have taken place within that august body in recent years. Especially, with the imminent establishment later in 2009 of a U.K. Supreme court, shortly to supplant the Lords as the United Kingdom's highest court of appeal.<br /><br />Unquestionably `the last of a judicial type `as Antony Lentin asserts, Lord Sumner was certainly `the overtly and unapologetically political law lord.'<br /><br />So, for lawyers and non-lawyers alike, particularly academics, this is a beautifully written and rather fascinating account of a man who, despite his eventual fame, knew the bitter taste of early and protracted failure, initially at the Bar and finally toward the end of his life, in his frustrated efforts to secure his heart's desire; the post of Lord Chancellor.<br /><br />`The greatest judge never to become Lord Chancellor' will nonetheless be remembered, thanks to this biography, as a towering judicial presence and an early and leading activist in cause of House of Lords reform.<br /><br />This biography by Cambridge Scholars Publishing is a welcome addition to the legal biographies library.  It's an extremely meticulous work which presents John Hamilton, Lord Sumner, in a sympathetic light which will delight historians, politicians and lawyers as it sums him up brilliantly.shment later in 2009 of a U.K. Supreme court, shortly to supplant the Lords as the United Kingdom's highest court of appeal.

B001FBSMF8|2.0|As a pop album, yes, it is better than most of what is out there. As a product of Chris Cornell, honestly, what happened? Where are the thoughtful lyrics, where is his voice?? Too busy competing against Timbaland. I'm not calling for Soundgarden [though that might be nice...], Audioslave, Temple of the Dog... what I'm asking for, is the artist that I grew to love to produce music that explores his strengths and talent... not just to sound like \\"everything else out there.\\" That's Chris Cornell to me; innovative, a truly inspiring lyricist, a commanding vocalist...     But that is absent here.  The album is \\"fun\\" to those who aren't looking to think about what they are hearing [or tend to enjoy pop music], but it does possess synthesis and rhythm. It's not for me, and I am saddened that Chris Cornell... one of my favourite musicians, truly let me down.    Good luck with this album.
B001F0TM5I|5.0|Well, to make this short all I have to say is make sure you don't let your kids view this movie. There is LOTS of swearing and cursing. Very foul mouthed movie (as all of Quentin Tarantino movies are.) But a good story and lots of car chase action. Only thing is I couldn't understand why Kurt Russel decided to play the part of stuntman mike. I mean to me it degrades him as a top actor. Maybe he needed the money. He made some pretty good movies in his life time. But this ones A long ways from the movie he made named \\"Soldier\\", or, \\"Wyatt Earp\\". I think the best movie Tarantino made was \\"Pulp Fiction\\". But I've only seen like 4 of his movies.

Most of the songs are about drugs or mention of drugs. Wasn't that what the 70's were all about. Lou wasn't gay I don't think. He married a girl but it only lasted a short while. The musicians on this album were all borrowed from Alice Coopers band. That's why it's so good. Really.

0312539517|3.0|I did not realize that the cd audio book was abridged, and possibly this created the perception that the book lacked depth in character or plot development;  at times it seemed like a \\"wikipedia travelogue\\";  it was like reading one of the old Landmark Books that we had back in middle school. I would think that focusing on the conflict between Mallory and Finch, or exploring the extraordinary ambivalence in Ruth's love for her husband and her reluctant aquiescence to his long departures from home, would have elevated this book to greater heights.  As an aside, I would suggest that interested readers find copies of Outside Magazine, October 1999 and National Geographic Adventure, Fall 1999 - for great articles on the expedition that found Mallory's body.

B000UNYJV8|5.0|This is a truly great indie film, probably one of the best to come out of the UK.  The acting is marvelous, especially the young man who plays Shaun.  It's a gritty, tough look both at how an ostracized child tries to fit in and how racism and patriotism collide in a Thatcher-era England.  Not to be missed, and the soundtrack is just great as well.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|We are watching this now on PBS, and so far it has been a wonderful rendition of one of our favorite tales.  It is lengthy and takes its time to tell the story.  So far, we are pleased with the screenplay and it has done a very solid job of converting the story.    The setting, characters, and speech all feel very authentic and the efforts which were taken to make all of it so true to the time are impressive.    The primary actor and actress, whatever their names, are doing outstanding jobs.  Very earnest renditions of the characters they are playing - and charming and worth watching.    We've not had any issues understanding what they are saying - the slang is not over-the-top or too accented for us US Midwesterners.  I've much more difficulty following Mark Twain than I do listening to this story.

1572810408|5.0|This warmly wonderful deck has been a personal favourite for over a decade!    Think of homemade bread....baking in the oven on warm summer afternoon. This deck has an aura and feel of comfort, serenity, warmth and poetic sweetness.    It feels a very summer deck with the rich colours and dreamy style of art. The images do speak to you in a very intimate way. The minors are very \\"moody\\" minors in that there not fully illustrated scenes, but do depict a general feel and mood of the cards.     This is the sort of deck that would calm you, bring you soothing vibes in your readings or just looking through the cards. The backs are charming and very pretty.     The Old English is still a classic after 12 years and I am sure shall be one for a very long time. A favourite among many.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian Michaels gives a pretty decent workout. There's the 321 system (3 minutes strength, two minutes cardio, one minute abs), which is good because just when you're getting tired of one thing she moves you onto another so it keeps you from stopping. I'm definitely sore after the workout; I definitely feel the burn. I wouldn't say the \\"modifications\\" are much of anything. To follow so and so for the modifications, well, she's not doing too much different except for during the push ups. Most of the moves don't even have modifications. The only real complaints I have are that sometimes Jillian sounds a little like a bad infomercial (\\"Look at those abs. That's amazing. I don't know about you, but I would do *anything* to get them,\\" Oh really? Cause you're filming a workout video in a sports bra. I would venture a guess that you ALREADY have those abs). I also found it irritating that she walks onto the screen chatting with the other girls like they just got done with a ladies lunch and then \\"oh hey! let's work out\\" haha. And lastly, I hate the really long intro to get to the menu on the dvd. I'm not sure if it's my player or the dvd but I can't skip it, so EVERY time I have to watch the explanation of the 321 system, what the workouts consist of and all the other intro stuff. I'd really just like to go straight to the menu.    I've never watched Biggest Loser and didn't know much about Jillian Michaels. Overall, I would say she's a little on the obnoxious side (maybe too scripted or something. I can't quite pinpoint it), but it's a good workout and I can definitely put up with 20 minutes. Besides that, the dvd gives you the option to turn her off and do the workout with music only.
B000FC1MCS|1.0|Not only was this book written in such a way as to make you want to slit your wrists with boredom, but even the storyline was ridiculous and tedious.  If I hadn't read this book in my Kindle, I would have thrown it across the room.  What a waste of time.
8170262259|1.0|Lost in Translation feedback best describes insight into what has happened with this new translation.  This book IS for both children and adults.  This new translation treats both as if they  are either uneducated or have no comprehension for the writen word. By cutting out and using only the most basic words, this new translation has lost the meaning, depth and beauty that Woods was able to capture. I was insulted and insulted for the future young readers, that this translator took it upon himself to attempt to make something better and instead resulting in a version that could make people put the book down rather than wanting to read on.<br /><br />I purchased this new version as a gift not realizing the translation was updated.  Several times I re-read the first page and kept putting the book down.  I thought that somewhere along the years I must have changed as I just felt something \\"lacking\\". The book did not come to life as I had remembered.<br /><br />I then got out my book given to me as a gift by a babysitter over 40 years ago.  I wanted to compare new and old as something just nagged at me that my memory could not be that off, even if I hadn't looked at this little book in so long a time.  Surprise - I re-read the opening chapter over and over in disbelief at what and how the words had been changed.<br /><br />My second thought was how could a publisher allow this translation to ever have been published.<br /><br />Anyone reading The Little Prince with this new translation for the first time should absolutely read the edition translated by Woods.<br /><br />I almost wanted to cry after I realized that I was unable to purchase a \\"new\\" book translated by Woods.<br /><br />Horrified, I went to all the used book locations in town and purchased all (leaving one for the next person who found themselves in the same situation) of the Woods translations for future gifts.<br /><br />That this new translator took it upon himself to think he could better what had already stood the test of time, well, I'd best stop but you can see that this book means a great deal to me.
0375701427|5.0|This was the first book I read by Mr. Roth and I have developed into quite a fan. This book, for me, is his best book, exploring themes of devoted families, fathers, terrorism...actually it weaves so many themes into one roller-coaster of a ride that I really can't name them all. Mainly, it is about a devoted father who's daughter goes terribly, terribly wrong in such a creative and interesting way. I don't like to give away plots in my reviews. But if you are looking for a deep read that truly explores one man's psyche, then read it. Roth is an amazing writer and I think that this is one of the best Zuckerman books, although I also really admired The Human Stain as well. I recently re-read it and it holds up just great upon the second reading.
B000244EMO|4.0|I have always liked this film.    FAVORITE BIT.  JESSE VENTURA & THAT GUN HIS CHARACTER USED!!  Just loved that.    Good action film.    Script however.  TO THIS DAY I STILL CAN NOT FIGURE OUT IF I HEARD CORRECTLY 1 LINE ARNOLD'S CHARACTER DUTCH SAYS.  MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.  When, he, Carl Weathers & his men attack the camp the hostages are in.  He yells at one of his men & MAKES NO SENSE.    BEFORE we learn Carl's character sent them there for a different reason FOR NO REASON all of Arnold's men treated him like garbage, with an attitude.  What did the character do BEFORE we learn about the REAL MISSION to deserve that?     Kind of a tacky DVD package.  Thin card board.  Mine is hard to get closed up.    Ok, regular, normal extras.    A passable, OK DVD package.

B001TH16DS|5.0|Let me get this correct.  You all are willing to spend $25.00 for a blu ray 2-hour movie, but not $80.00 for 29 hours of blu ray remastered and retooled sesaon 1's Star Trek TOS?  And, they're giving you the original episodes as a bonus, so you can sell your RCS's, Beta's, VHS's, and various incarnations of DVD's.  Come on.  That's not even $12.00 per blu ray DVD.  It's like half the price of a movie.  Get with it people.  Paramount buthers everyone of their TV DVD releases.  At least thank them for this.
0375842209|5.0|This book needs to be in a special category where we can give a book of this caliber a whole constellation of stars. I'm not into giving away the plot of a book...other's do that so well. This book is so inventive, so beautifully written, so lovingly narrated (by Death! who is a most compassionate character) it is a joy to behold. For YA readers (and I'm glad I didn't know that it was for that audience because I may have skipped it) the book has some drawings and lots of white space so they feel like they are reading a very long (over 500 page) book, when, in reality, with different typesetting and formatting it could easily fit into 250 pages. The characters will stay with you forever and all I can really say is read it, read it, read it and then buy 5 copies and give it to everyone you love. I did get to hear Markus Zusak speak at a bookstore and he said it is the story of his grandmother. It is amazing what people can live through. He is a really great speaker and a fantastic writer. Treat yourself to one of the best books you will ever love.
0316017922|2.0|The author got every non-New Yorker subscribers attention with Blink and Tipping Point, and he no doubt wanted this book to ride the wave. He's done it (kinda sorta) but he's getting a little sloppy as he goes along. The book has several chapters which are good short stories, but overall they don't fit together as a cohesive message and do not effectively communicate the 'Outliers' theme.<br /><br />For instance, the chapter on Korean Air Lines was another \\"Huh!\\" moment, especially for anyone with a modicum of understanding of Korean culture. But I did not see what this had to do with outliers. Ok, so we have a culture where instances like a co-pilot speaking up when a senior pilot is in error is less likely to occur. And..?  Unless this was intended to show an extreme in the opposite direction (i.e., an undesirable outlier) it didn't seem to fit.<br /><br />Also, his chapter concerning the KIPP schools addressed the outlier theme, but the facts were tailored to suit the authors template. Not all KIPP schools operate the same way, some have entrance exams and some do not. There are indeed kids who fail out of KIPP schools, but Gladwell makes it sound as if every random child out there is an undiscovered Einstein but for their lack of a KIPP school. And lets not get started about government involvement, funding or the inclusion/exclusion of teachers unions in these schools to whatever degree - many more variables exist here.<br /><br />Finally, there is the description of the rise of Jewish immigrants coming to America, building businesses out of nothing, passing it to their children who grew the businesses even more, then having the grandchildren go on to become - lawyers. I'm not sure that this is flattering.<br /><br />In fact, Gladwells description of the NYC Jewish law firms thereafter becoming more powerful by taking business cases that the traditional (WASP) legal establishment saw as lowbrow and unprofessional inevitably contributes to a negative stereotype of Jewish lawyers and the 'profession' in general. Maybe there is no other way to tell this part of the story, or maybe it did not have to be told at all. It doesn't really come across as anything to be proud of, but Gladwell obviously knows his readers. Judging by the reviews, they agree.<br /><br />Overall it's another short breezy read for airport lounges, either that or an ok bathroom book.ession' in general.

B001CTDH4Y|3.0|I'll start with a personal confession.  If I'm in a theatre and a trailer comes on advertising a film in which dogs talk, play basketball, or turn into lawyers, I nearly gag.  (A notable exception is \\"Babe\\" which featured talking pigs, dogs, sheep and other livestock.  But Babe the Pig not only talks, he is noble and surrounded by other character who aren't intellectually insulting.) It's also worth mentioning that in real life I honestly wonder about the mental health of people whose relationships with pets are more meaningful than their relationships with other humans.<br /><br />That being said - \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" is a cute and enjoyable movie.  Chloe (voice by Drew Barrymore) is the pampered pet of a cosmetics tycoon, played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Chloe has more outfits than my wife and all my daughters, along with a diamond collar that could be traded for a stealth bomber.<br /><br />Chloe lives with Viv in a Beverly Hills Mansion, where she gets to lounge around with other pampered pooches and make fun of Papi (voiced by George Lopez), the mutt owned by Viv's landscaper.<br /><br />Viv goes out of town, leaving niece Rachel (played by Piper Perabo) in charge of everything including Chloe.  Rachel promptly heads for Mexico with her young and irresponsible friends and Chloe.<br /><br />When the young girls head out for a night on the town, Chloe decides she won't be left behind and heads out on her own.  She is quickly captured and taken to a dog-fighting operation where she is thrown into a ring with a Doberman (voice by Edward James Olmos).  She is rescued by former police German Shepherd Delgado (voice by Andy Garcia) and the remainder of the film is about Chloe trying to get back home while being helped by Delgado.<br /><br />Along the way they meet the canine versions of just about every Mexican stereotype known.<br /><br />At this point of the review I realize that I am describing a not very good movie.  Let me put it this way - life is too short to watch bad movies, eat bad food, listen to bad music, etc.  For movies, especially rentals and cable, I simply stop watching if they're really, really bad.  We rented this because of visiting relatives and I watched it to the end.

6305558167|2.0|Excalibur (John Boorman, 1981)<br /><br />I've been wanting to see Excalibur since the first days I had HBO, back when it was still in its first run on pay TV. I was still a little squid back then, however, and my parents forbade me to see it; it's since taken almost twenty-five years for me to actually get round to seeing it. And I must say that, given the level of talent in the cast and a director of the stature of John Boorman, I didn't expect the thing to be quite so awful. But, then again, John Boorman, in the twenty years between Deliverance and The General, with the arguable exception of Hope and Glory, directed movies ranging from harmless fluff to gormless crap, and as far as the cast, well, Tinto Brass managed to harness one even more impressive than this for the [edited for Amazon consumption] that was Caligula. Which makes me, in retrospect, somewhat less surprised at the jaw-dropping carnage that Boorman and co-screenwriter Rospo Pallenberg (who also collaborated with Boorman on The Emerald Forest and Exorcist II) made of Thomas Malory. And I say this as someone who, in school, grew to absolutely loathe Malory. (In all honesty, to date the only Arthurian literature I've read that I can  stomach is von Eschenbach's Parzival, though I tried not to let my anti-Arthur bias affect me too much; Boorman had as much to do with this production's mange as Malory ever could.)<br /><br />The story, of course, involves the rise and fall of King Arthur (Nigel Terry, recently of Troy), from his conception by Uther (Spider's Gabriel Byrne in an early role) to the fall of the Round Table. Of course, even clocking in at one hundred forty minutes, Excalibur is the Cliffs' Notes version of Le Morte d'Arthur, and so you're bound to notice a few stories that fell by the wayside (the most notable omission to my mind was the tale of the Green Knight), but even those they kept were pared to the minimum; Boorman's tale spends half an hour and more on Uther's seduction of Arthur's mother, and then strips out the meat of the Grail quest almost entire? One wonders how long the original directors' cut ran, and if it might be any better.<br /><br />It's not just the plot that gets short shrift here. Boorman coaxed every last shred of overacting out of everyone in this cast. Not that that's entirely unexpected in British costume drama (Dangerous Liaisons, anyone? A Room with a View?), but it seems somehow far more out of place in Arthurian drama than it does in those silly Victorian drawing-room things. You kind of expect all the heavy sighs and the fainting there. Here it runs to the farcical, especially when done by the knights themselves. There are times when it seemed Monty Python and the Holy Grail had more the right of it than Excalibur (and I had to check to see which one came first the third time I found myself wondering how much Boorman had been informed by Gilliam; Holy Grail, of course, was released six years before this, and yes, there are times when it looks like Boorman is drawing more from Gilliam than Malory).<br /><br />Still, while it is undoubtedly a mess, it is a very pretty mess, with cinematography by the late Alex Thompson (who did the camerawork on many of Branagh's Shakespeare adaptations) and an early score from Trevor Jones (interestingly, Thompson and Jones would work together again, over a decade later, on another unqualified mess that's become a cult hit--the Sly Stallone vehicle Cliffhanger). While I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone except medieval-lit students who are too lazy to read Internet summaries of Malory, if you do decide to go ahead and watch it, at the very least you'll be entertained by the scenery. (And by this, no, I do not mean that Helen Mirren gets anywhere near as naked here as she does in Caligula, more's the pity.) **en strips out the meat of the Grail quest almost entire?

There are times when it seemed Monty Python and the Holy Grail had more the right of it than Excalibur (and I had to check to see which one came first the third time I found myself wondering how much Boorman had been informed by Gilliam; Holy Grail, of course, was released six years before this, and yes, there are times when it looks like Boorman is drawing more from Gilliam than Malory).    Still, while it is undoubtedly a mess, it is a very pretty mess, with cinematography by the late Alex Thompson (who did the camerawork on many of Branagh's Shakespeare adaptations) and an early score from Trevor Jones (interestingly, Thompson and Jones would work together again, over a decade later, on another unqualified mess that's become a cult hit--the Sly Stallone vehicle Cliffhanger). While I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone except medieval-lit students who are too lazy to read Internet summaries of Malory, if you do decide to go ahead and watch it, at the very least you'll be entertained by the scenery. (And by this, no, I do not mean that Helen Mirren gets anywhere near as naked here as she does in Caligula, more's the pity.) **
0618918248|2.0|Richard Dawkins believes in the resurrection. He believes in it so much, that he is leading a crusade to convince others of it, and, like the revivalists of old, he has hit the circuit looking for converts. The resurrection Dawkins believes in is not the Resurrection (the one with a capital 'R'), but another kind altogether. His faith is not faith in God, but faith in science--or rather, Science. It is not the Resurrection of Christ he is preaching, but the resurrection of a movement.<br /><br />With his new book, The God Delusion, Dawkins places himself at the head of what one journalist has called the \\"New Atheism.\\" His book is one of several released over the last year that have attempted to reverse the rise of evangelical Christianity, and, to a lesser extent, fundamentalist Islam. He is the first person in the new atheist trinity, which includes Daniel Dennett and Sam Harris, both of whom have written similar anti-religious tracts, and both of whom, like Dawkins, are filled with the spirit, and shouting their message from the street corners.<br /><br />Before Dawkins begins the business of calling hellfire and brimstone down on the believers, however, he points his finger at those who pretend to be standing on the sidelines in the debate over the truth of religion and the existence of God. He first goes after the agnostics. With the earlier and more eloquent atheist George Bernard Shaw, Dawkins charges agnostics with the sin of being atheists without the courage of their convictions.<br /><br />Well, most of them anyway. He makes a distinction between the kind of agnostic who temporarily suspends judgement until he has more evidence one way or another, and the kind of agnostic who believes that the question of God's existence is unanswerable. The first are the sheep, the second the goats. The first he can abide, but for the second he has little but disdain. It is this second school of thought that Dawkins refers to when he talks about the \\"poverty of agnosticism.\\" It is here where Dawkins parts company with many of his allies in the scientific establishment, and it is here where Dawkins distinguishes himself from the great atheistic philosophies of the 20th century, returning instead to the 19th.<br /><br />Although the title of \\"New\\" has been placed on his brand of atheism, Dawkins is an atheist of the old school. He is preachy, condescending, and a bit of a scold. Apparently impatient with philosophical subtleties, he seems to have shirked off the more sophisticated criticisms of early 2oth century philosophy. Beginning with Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, skeptical philosophers began to argue that religion was neither true nor false, but simply meaningless. This view received its most articulate treatment in A. J. Ayer's 1928 book, Language, Truth, and Logic. The first chapter of Ayer's book, \\"The End of Metaphysics,\\" remains one of the few persuasive attacks on religious belief, although Ayer himself later gave up on much of the views expressed in the book. This view has dominated higher level discussions of religious truth questions ever since.<br /><br />Dawkin's approach, however, harkens back to days of Robert Ingersoll, Joseph McCabe, and Joseph Lewis. He is not quite their equal in severity and lack of a sense of humor, but he rivals them in fervor. Like these stern atheists of old, Dawkins prefers to face religion head on, and his contempt for less direct approaches is transparent.<br /><br />Dawkins first takes on Stephen Jay Gould, now conveniently dead (as are many of Dawkin's chosen opponents). Gould, a Harvard paleontologist and popular science writer, believed that religious questions such as the existence of God are simply not scientific questions, and that science cannot therefore adjudicate them. It is a version of the Two Truths doctrine of the medieval Arab philosopher Averroes, who held that there are truths of reason and truths of faith, and that truths in one sphere may be falsehoods inthe other.<br /><br />\\"[T]o cite old cliches,\\" Dawkins quotes Gould as saying, \\"science gets the age of rocks, and religion the rock of ages; science studies how the heavens go, religion how to go to heaven.\\" Dawkins will have none of it: \\"What are these ultimate questions,\\" he asks, \\"in whose presence religion is an honored guest and science must respectfully slink away?\\" Dawkins denies that there can be two truths, one for science and one for religion: \\"... a universe with a creative superintendent would be a very different kind of universe from one without. Why is that not a scientific matter?\\"<br /><br />In fact, Dawkins castigates the American scientific establishment for assuming this Two Truths doctrine in their debate with the Intelligent Design movement, denouncing the National Center for Science Education and their ilk as the \\"Neville Chamberlain School of Evolutionists.\\" On this question, ironically, Dawkins is on the side of the Intelligent Design movement--and Christianity in general. Religious truth claims make a difference in the world, but while Christianity maintains the claims are true, Dawkins pronounces them false.<br /><br />Dawkins summarizes the argument of his book this way:<br /><br />  Any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution. Creative intelligences, being evolved, necessarily arrive late in the universe, and therefore cannot be responsible for designing it. God...is a delusion; and, as later chapters show, a pernicious delusion.<br /><br />There are several problems with his argument that ultimately make The God Delusion a great disappointment. The first is his tendency to avoid proving his own theses in favor of simply assuming them and hoping the reader will find the implications of them as attractive and self-evident as he does. The scientist in him wants to test the predictability of his theory, in this case with speculative theories of how things might have come about solely by virtue of material conditions. He uses this method in his discussion of the origin of religion and of morality, and it falls flat.<br /><br />His entire discussion of the origin of religion requires you to have previously accepted his naturalistic world view. \\"Knowing that we are products of Darwinian evolution...\\" he begins, and then we are off to the races. \\"The proximate cause of religion might be hyperactivity in a particular node of the brain,\\" he declares. But the ultimate cause, he thinks, lies in his theory that religion is \\"a byproduct of something else.\\" He then launches into various theories of what religious belief may have been useful for, all of which are pure speculation.<br /><br />Dawkin's whole discussion of the naturalistic explanation of religion assumes that such an explanation renders the beliefs thus explained illusory. But if a naturalistic explanation for a belief renders it illusory, and all beliefs can be explained naturalistically, then atheism too can be explained naturalistically, and is therefore illusory. He who lives by naturalistic explanations must die by them.<br /><br />All of Dawkin's explanations seem stifled and contrived by his own ideological materialism. He uses his naturalistic world view as a Procrustean bed into which he tries to fit everything, however much he has to hack and stretch it to fit. And what a small bed it is.<br /><br />The second problem with Dawkin's book is the condescending tone with which he dismisses the arguments of those with whom he disagrees. One religious argument is \\"amusing, if rather pathetic,\\" another \\"a joke,\\" another \\"silly,\\" and another \\"a grotesque piece of reasoning.\\" This glib attitude particularly plagues the section of the book dealing with the traditional arguments for Christianity.<br /><br />St. Thomas's cosmological arguments for God's existence--that the universe requires an explanation--\\"are easily...exposed as vacuous.\\" Anselm's ontological argument for God's existence is \\"infantile.\\" And William Paley's design argument, he says, Charles Darwin \\"blows out of the water.\\"<br /><br />And where simple pejoratives won't do, and arguments actually employed, Dawkins fails to impress. In response to C. S. Lewis's trilemma--that Jesus was either a liar, a lunatic, or God Himself--Dawkins simply posits the possibility that Jesus was honestly mistaken, despite the fact that anyone familiar with the force of this argument knows that is certainly not a possibility. And besides, \\"historically it is complete nonsense.\\" Dawkins asserts that there is no good historical evidence that Jesus thought he was divine, but his response to the wealth of evidence that he did is nowhere to be found. He questions the historical existence of Jesus, a belief that has few adherents outside its friendly home in liberal theological seminaries.<br /><br />In the end, Dawkins admits that Jesus probably existed, but that the Biblical documents are unreliable, his only argument being that \\"reputable\\" Biblical scholars (undoubtedly defined as those with whom Dawkins agrees) question them.<br /><br />Somehow it all seems too easy.<br /><br />Even if you didn't recognize the lack of philosophical sophistication in Dawkin's attempted refutations, you notice immediately that Dawkins has trouble even conceiving how anyone could ever have been convinced by these arguments. This is not only an intellectual weakness in Dawkin's approach, but a rhetorical one. Somehow, you are more persuaded by the detractors of a position who appreciate the strength of their opponents positions than those, like Dawkins, who don't. You feel as if the person hasn't really confronted the power of the arguments against his own position, and you therefore wonder how it would affect his opinion if he did.<br /><br />In too many cases in the book Dawkins is justified in his dismissiveness toward the arguments he takes on, but only because he has cherry picked the weakest arguments for theism. And this is the third great deficiency of the book.<br /><br />Outside of a few places in the second section of the book, Dawkins boxes at shadows that seem a poor imitation of historic theism. A close inspection of the index reveals how little familiarity Dawkins has with modern Christian apologetics. He mentions only a small handful of great modern Christian thinkers. There is even a passing mention of G. K. Chesterton. But none of these are carefully considered.<br /><br />He admits Lewis into his book briefly (and, as we said, dismissively), but where is J. Gresham Machan, Cornelius Van Til, and John Warwick Montgomery, or, more contemporaneously, Alvin Plantinga, J. P. Moreland, and Francis Beckwith? They are glaringly absent. Instead, Dawkins prefers to take on the likes of Pat Robertson, Oral Roberts, Jesse Helms, and Fred Phelps, the fundamentalist minister of Westboro Baptist Church who pickets funerals with signs saying that \\"fags\\" are \\"going to Hell\\". These names constitute a sort of religious bum-of-the-month club that allows Dawkins to avoid fighting the real contenders.<br /><br />How convenient.<br /><br />In his debate with the atheist philosopher C.E.M. Joad (who later became a Christian) in the first part of the 20th century, Catholic writer Arnold Lunn pointed out that a position must be judged on the basis of the strongest arguments for it, not the weakest ones you can find.<br /><br />The God Delusion has received the usual plaudits from the expected sources. But criticism has come from places well outside the religious community. Two of the most stinging critiques have come from the philosopher Thomas Nagel, and literary critic Terry Eagleton. And indeed everything that Dawkin's attempts in The God Delusion has been done better in some other book. A reader interested in a naturalistic explanation of religion and a critical view of the historicity of Christianity will find it stated more convincingly in H. L. Mencken's Treatise on the Gods. Those who are looking for a philosophically sophisticated attack on theism would be better off with Ayer's Language, Truth, and Logic. And, ironically, a much better argument against design in nature from an evolutionary perspective is Dawkin's own Blind Watchmaker.<br /><br />And speaking of Mencken, atheism's last great popularizer, Dawkins seems clearly to be trying to emulate him, but to little affect. Mencken's attacks on religion were informed with a real wit that Dawkins sorely lacks. Mencken also had a poetic sense of the world that seems missing in Dawkins. Without the aesthetic appeal of Mencken, Dawkin's condescension sounds more akin to the more pedestrian likes of Madelaine Murray O'Hair. It wouldn't sound entirely out of place in this book to hear Dawkins utter an O'Hair line such as, \\"Jesus wasn't worthly to lick my boots.\\"<br /><br />Mencken was the last of the old school atheists, who openly declared their opinion that religion was absurd, and spared no effort in running it down. Mencken considered religious adherents to be boobs, largely because he considered most everyone to be boobs. Dawkins, however, is more selective in his disdain, choosing to scorn only the believers.<br /><br />This refusal to take religious views seriously prevents Dawkins from convincingly dealing with them, and it is this consideration that prevents us from judging atheism on the basis of Dawkin's book. If we did, we would only be engaging in the very behavior that mars Dawkin's book itself: judging a position by something less than the best arguments for it.Darwin \\"blows out of the water.\\"    And where simple pejoratives won't do, and arguments actually employed, Dawkins fails to impress.

B001PPLIFU|5.0|Taking up the action literally minutes after the ending of [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale]], [[ASIN:B001PPLIFU Quantum of Solace]] can not be fully enjoyed without considering it as part two.  It's a spectacular wrap-up of the loose ends, Bond on a heat-seeking mission of revenge.  Like others, I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have the same constant psychological gamesmanship that layered [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale]] so satisfyingly.  However [[ASIN:B001PPLIFU Quantum of Solace]] does have a good story.  The problem is, despite the fact that the action sequences are relatively short, they're so sudden and edited so incomprehensibly tight, there's no time to regain composure between when the frenzy stops and expositional dialogue takes up.  The initial impression of the film is one of bewilderment.<br /><br />But there's no sense arguing that point.  You either liked it or you didn't.  Myself, even in the theater, I knew I was overwhelmed by the breakneck pacing, that I had been left behind like one of the corpses in Bond's wake.  I was eager then to take a second look, preferably in hi-def, where it'll probably at least look better than it did in the theater.  Well, it did.  [[ASIN:B001PPLIFU Quantum of Solace [Blu-ray]]] looked as good as [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale [Blu-ray]]], with nearly the same abundance of interesting colors and textures.  Different from [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale]], [[ASIN:B001PPLIFU Quantum of Solace]] contained scenes in vast arid locales, which provided some nice earth tones and wide vistas, all nicely rendered.  Some of it was startlingly beautiful, like in the crowded streets and long shots of the hillsides of stacked exotic tenements.  Each locale was marked with a distinct palette, instilling a kind of surprise when the scenes changed.  The picture was brilliant and sharp throughout.  And I want to mention, the story itself definitely made more sense.  If you're unsure if you liked it or not, see it again.  It's definitely a very good movie.  Definitely.<br /><br />As for the extra features, of course, you have the  Jack White/Alicia Keyes video and the two trailers.  Then there's the usual making-of documentary, with interviews with the principals, Marc Foster, Daniel Craig, and so on; along with stunt pilots, location scouts, and so forth.  There was a satisfying interview with and demonstration by the composer David Arnold.  Not so satisfying was the 44-minute compilation of  production blogs by some thirty-odd technical people, sliced into too-thin 1m10s lengths.  They were so short, they became uninteresting after a while.  But the rest is good enough.  The main thing was that the film itself was as good as I suspected, and the picture and sound were outstanding.  Now the story is complete.<br />______________________________________________________________definitely a very good movie.  Definitely.

B001PU8N0I|3.0|Anyone who has not seen the magnificent 1988 six-hour movie production with Derek Jacobi, Alec Guinness, and Joan Greenwood, which I was lucky enough to see in a London cinema, might find this production of \\"Little Dorrit\\" interesting. Matthew MacFadyen is engaging, as is the actress who plays the title role. Some of the characters, however--such as the butler, whose name ought to be \\"Igor\\" rather than Flintwich; and the simpering \\"lost love\\" of the hero--sink into parody; as does the heavy-handed symbolism of the scattered pages on the floor of the Office of Circumlocutions and the birds in cages. The bleak production, moreover, seemed disjointed and lacking in pace.<br /><br />Perhaps it is unfair to compare the present production with the previous one (which is incomparable in respect to actors, costumes, cinematography and production values), but there it is. On the bright side, Amazon has a sign-up notification list for the 1988 production, which is apparently to be released in the future (Let us hope that it is in the near future!).

B000TGCR38|4.0|Zwartboek (Paul Verhoeven, 2007)<br /><br />The ultimate irony of Zwartboek is that co-writers Paul Verhoeven and Gerard Soeteman, collaborating for the first time since 1985's Flesh + Blood, set the framing story in 1956, at the outset of the Suez War. And thus it is that Rachel Rosenthal (Valkyrie's Carice van Houten), nee Rachel Stein, aka Ellis de Vries, finally escapes the aftermath of World War II, gets to Israel to live on a kibbutz (where, we find out in the opening scene, she becomes an elementary school teacher), and is almost immediately embroiled in another war. While it's not explicit, I have little doubt that Verhoeven and Soeteman, who have paid so much attention to detail throughout this complex, absorbing movie, had something to say about the plight of European Jews through their choice of setting during the framing story; if it ain't one war, it's another, and moments of peace are few and far between.<br /><br />Rachel Stein, you see, was a spy for the Dutch resistance. Or her real-life analogue was, whoever it may have been (Verhoeven said in an interview that \\"the events are real, the story is not\\"). When her family tries to flee, they run into a Nazi ambush and are gunned down, with only Rachel surviving. She is found by the Dutch resistance, and after a chance meeting on a train with Ludwig M&uuml;ntze (Sebastian Koch, recently of The Shell Seekers), she goes to work as a spy in M&uuml;ntze's office after he falls for her. She works as a secretary while spying for the resistance, feeding them information about M&uuml;ntze and his colleague G&uuml;nther Franken (Waldemar Kobus). But, of course, things can, and do, go wrong.<br /><br />There's a particular scene in the movie that really explains why it works, to me. It's just after Rachel, using the alias Ellis de Vries, goes to work for the Nazis, at an after-hours party. Franken is playing the piano, laughing it up, having a good time. Rachel keeps looking at him, not quite able to figure out where she's seen him before, then she places him--he was one of the Nazis on the boat, the ones who'd killed her family. After her brief flashback, we cut back to Franken, still playing the piano, still moving in the same way. His body language hasn't changed, he's still jovial, but his facial expression is dark, ominous, just as it had been on the boat. It's the little things like that Verhoeven tweaked that turn this from an otherwise decent movie into a really good one. That, and the fact that romances set in the Nazi era don't usually work, but Van Houten and Koch steam up the screen; their chemistry is unmistakable, probably because they've been an item in real life for years. A very, very good movie, definitely worth your time. ****ces him--he was one of the Nazis on the boat, the ones who'd killed her family.

B001P9KR8U|1.0|I received this DVD today (a day early, yay!) and I'm really disappointed to find the special features are missing!  The back of the box says the disc contains a making-of featurette, 12 deleted scenes, and director commentary.  I can't find these features anywhere on the DVD though!  The only \\"features\\" are trailers for other movies.  Did anyone else notice this problem?  Unless I missed a menu option, I'm thinking they're missing, and this is truly disappointing.    Another problem is the subtitles.  The DVD version retains the \\"boxed\\" English subtitles from the theatrical release, which are, of course, terribly small on a home TV.  If you select English subtitles from the menu, it only gives them to what isn't already translated, i.e. song lyrics.    Five stars for the movie itself but only one for the DVD.

B00005MM01|5.0|I got the single album of the first 10 songs around 1967-68.  The songs are simple and pure and relaxing.  Many of them stuck with me for all these years.  Since my record player is long gone (but not the best albums), I decided to get this cd.  I had never heard the last 10 songs, save for those that made it to greatest hits compilations.  I agree with other reviewers that these are exceptional, bringing the listener to a long forgotton sea shore on the British Isles.  I highly recommend the Hurdy Gurdy Man cd - my favorite Donovan song is the last - \\"Teas\\".
B000J4QWMC|3.0|Miami Vice (Michael Mann, 2006)<br /><br />The opening scene in Miami Vice makes it clear, in at least one respect, how Michael Mann and his team have changed over the years. The music in the original TV series Miami Vice was one of the best things about it; Jan Hammer's adrenaline-fueled electropop was bolstered by tracks from such artists as Phil Collins, Glenn Frey, Jackson Browne, Steve Jones, and Bryan Ferry--music that was both rooted in the past and, at least where the eighties were concerned, was well-integrated into the present. Now comes Michael Mann's \\"updated\\" film version (in which \\"updated\\" equates to, for example, Colin Farrell's hair being even worse than Don Johnson's was twenty years previous), whose opening scene's music is awful in the extreme, turning a five-minute scene into an endless loop of aural torture best viewed on fast-forward. (Any plot points you miss will be reiterated later, don't worry.) The rest of it's not much better, with a focus on simple, repetitious lyrics and the kind of mindless four-on-the-floor electronica that's here today, gone tomorrow.<br /><br />The more mechanical applications of the update have lost less depth, but their faithfulness does turn the movie into not much more than a feature-length episode of the television show upon which the movie is based. Crockett (Farrell) and Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) go undercover in the organization of a drug lord. Crockett battles with his ethics and gets involved with a beautiful enemy (Gong Li). Tubbs is his anchor to reality. The villains are, well, villainous (though of course the beautiful chick isn't all villainous), the good guys are good guys, and the plot's as straightforward as any 1930s Fantomas episode. It's a decent film, and if you're a fan of Michael Mann's style of filmmaking, that  should be enough to carry this for you. But it's empty calories. ***
B001U9BRNE|4.0|I thought I knew a lot about pop culture.  I was surprised I never heard of David Foster before.  That's probably because writers/producers don't get much publicity; the singers do.  So when Foster came up with the idea of staging a concert where all of his friends sing his songs, he made himself as well known to the general public as his singers.  Few behind-the-scenes writers/producers have ever done this, with notable exceptions being Quincy Jones and screenwriter William Goldman.    As a college freshman in 1981, I loved Earth, Wind & Fire's \\"After the Love Has Gone.\\"  Foster wrote that?  Yes.  If you don't know of Foster already, you'll be going through that Q&A many times during the concert.  (And many more times when you read his companion autobiography, which I was inspired to read after seeing the concert.)  I won't go over the songs he's written or the singers he's worked with because there are too many.  But in looking over the song list for this concert, you'll never see as much talent on one stage singing their biggest hits as you'll see here.      You can tell someone has a transcendent talent when he makes you enjoy songs or music genres that you don't usually enjoy.  (Luther Vandross and Barry Manilow do that for me when they sing other artists' songs, and they're two of the few who are good enough to confidently venture into that territory regularly.)  For example, I'm not a big fan of Andrea Bocelli's music.  But when he sang \\"The Prayer\\" with Katherine McPhee, it brought me to another place, like a church, or an opera.  Having them sing alternately in Italian and English was inspired music.  (As a special treat, watch closely as Bocelli holds the final note for as long as the New York Giants gave Eli Manning time to complete that impossible fourth down pass to David Tyree in the 2008 Super Bowl.  McPhee has to take a breath to stay with him, and even then she can't.  At the end, she throws up her hands as if to say \\"How does he do it?\\".)  I gaineda newfound respect for both singers, and I think only Foster could do that for \\"casual\\" music fans like me.        As another example, I vaguely only heard of Michael Buble and never heard of country (ugh!) singer Blake Shelton.  When they did a duet on \\"Home\\", I loved the song and it made me feel like I was in my childhood home, in the backwoods of a small Pennsylvania town, with a freshly baked apple pie sitting on the window sill in the late afternoon.  They say that at their best, food and music take people back to another time, to another place, make them feel pleasurable emotions, or remember fond memories.  These songs did that; they had substance, they were nourishing, like food for the soul.    You could tell that Foster loves and admires his singers and their talent, like they admire his.  When Brian McKnight hits an impossibly high note on \\"After the Love Has Gone\\", Foster can't help but talk over the song (why can't he, it's his song?) with an \\"Oh yeah!\\" to show his admiration for his talent.  I loved it because I yelled the same thing.  Foster does that throughout the night, as would you if Michael Jordan took the stage, followed by Larry Bird, followed by Magic Johnson, etc.  The only reason I did not give this concert a rating of 5 is because of a brief segment when Foster introduced some new young talent for the first time.  Yes, the 14-year-old girl sang way beyond her years, but I thought she was out of place among more established veterans.  But that's a small quibble.  Foster finds new talent and launches their careers. That's what he does, that's been part of the theme for his career, so it wasn't totally out of character for the evening.    There's a lot here for any music fan to enjoy.  Dance songs, ballads, thoughtful songs, inspirational songs, everything.  With so many stars in attendance to pay homage to the man who launched or guided their careers, this is a concert that you would go to wearing a suit and tie.  In fact, I cooked up a special meal for my wife and I to pair with this concert: butter lettuce with oranges, avocado, and shallot vinaigrette; lentils braised in red wine; quail and sausages braised in grapes; grilled polenta; paired with a nice bottle of Pinot Noir.  Oh yeah!      Foster said he thinks Bocelli is the closest thing to Mozart that the music world has in terms of talent.  That inspired us to watch \\"Amadeus\\" afterwards on blu-ray.  Both concerts looked and sounded great.  David, thanks for a special evening and a special career creating many of my favorite songs with my favorite artists.  And if you're ever up in San Franciso, look me up -- I want to say thanks and cook for you!

B00009Y3L4|5.0|Cabaret (Bob Fosse, 1972)<br /><br />I watched Bob Fosse's Cabaret for the first time in almost thirty years last night, and what jumped out at me was the state of education in America today. Which doesn't make sense when you're talking about a film set in 1931 Germany, I grant you. But the first time I saw it, back in late 1980, I was in seventh grade, and it was shown in music class. Yes, a class of seventh-graders sat, quietly, spellbound, for two hours, watching Cabaret. Imagine if the movie were shown in music class in 2009. How many parents would be up in arms, trying to get the teacher fired, or jailed, for showing students a movie that contained profanity, homosexuality, risqu&eacute; costumes, Nazis, and a protagonist who sleeps with more than one man and isn't married to any of them? Forget being jailed. They'd call for the teacher's head on a pole outside the school. Back in 1980, did anyone raise a stink? Of course not. And we seventh-graders didn't get most of that anyway. We were too busy paying attention to the music, the spectacle, the glamour of the thing. (I didn't even remember how seedy the Kit Kat Club was; when you're twelve, and you've got Joel Grey and Liza Minnelli marketing it to you as the pinnacle of culture in Berlin, you tend to believe them.) And are we really any better for it? Again, of course not. I'm of a mind to say we're worse. I hope I'm not alone. As for Cabaret itself, well, it's as understated as Fosse's later All That Jazz is ebullient.<br /><br />Germany in 1931 was the height of between-the-wars decadence; the Nazis had not yet come to power, and expatriates from all over the globe flocked to Berlin, where the cost of living was cheap, and so was life. Sally Bowles (Minnelli) is one of those expatriates, an American singer working at the rundown Kit Kat Club, along with a host of others headed up by the mysterious Master of Ceremonies (Grey). By day she rents a room from Fraulein Schneider (Elisabeth Neumann-Viertel from Town Without Pity). One day, Brian Roberts (Michael York) wanders into the place looking for a cheap room; he ends up across from Sally, and the two of them become fast friends. All goes well, with Sally singing at the cabaret and Brian teaching English for a living (the film's most enchanting subplot, as well as the main device allowing the gradual Nazi takeover of Germany to creep in on the sidelines, is a budding romance between two of Brian's pupils), until Maximilan von Heune (The Plot to Kill Hitler's Helmut Griem) appears on the scene, stirring the very small pot with his wealth, extravagance, and flirtatious nature.<br /><br />Love triangles can be a touchy subject on film, but John van Druten's play (based loosely on Christopher Isherwood's Berlin Stories) gets everything right, and Fosse's adaptation just expands on the source material; the three personalities involved here are perfectly tuned to play against one another in the most entertaining possible ways, and they never fail to do so. The three main characters, once that stage is set, snipe, pick, and fight at one another (against the backdrop of Brian's two students, who have entirely different relationship problems), and we can just sit back and chuckle, albeit a bit uncomfortably. Life is a cabaret, old chum, indeed.<br /><br />But even now, thirty years after first seeing it, the scenes that really resonate with me--and I'm a person who, as a rule, is not at all fond of musicals--are the stage performances. A lot of them, for obvious reasons, make a lot more sense now that I'm in my forties and have a better sense of history. (The punch line of Joel Grey's number with the ape? Priceless. And then Fosse cuts to the Nazi officer sitting in the shadows...) Joel Grey is absolute magic in this role (well, duh, he did win Best Supporting Actor), as he is almost every time he graces a movie screen. He and Minnelli play off each other in an entirely different, but just as interesting, way as she plays offYork (who comes across here as less assured, and more appealing, than in any other movie in which I've seen him). The dark, smoky atmosphere, the routines that tread the line of burlesque, the pointed political criticism, it's all Broadway sorcery that works in a way only Bob Fosse has ever, in my experience, been able to translate correctly to a movie screen. I'm not talking about musicals in general here, but the almost surreal qualities that Fosse's movies tend to (viz, the surgery routine in All That Jazz or the aforementioned ape routine here). Amazing stuff, and well worth your time. A classic for a reason. **** ½ssured, and more appealing, than in any other movie in which I've seen him).

0393035158|4.0|The End of Faith is a good primer or basic introduction on the subject of atheism. With that in mind I recommend the book to any Christian or theist that might come to this review. Unfortunately the atheist viewpoint is seldom read or heard in America though nonbelievers make up about 10% of the population. Now, Mr. Harris can get a bit mystical so I can't give him 5 stars on this review, only four. The simple truth is that faith in America is dimenshing in America as relative to what it once was in America or so, \\"the end of faith.\\" Obviously faith will exist for decades more but America will become closer to nations such as Canada where the population becomes even more secular. I look forward to it.    I feel the need to respond to the loooooooong comment that follows on my review. Ok, technically this book is more centered on criticism of faith/religion then a primer on atheism but since 90% of Americans are completely ignorant on what atheism is in America and why atheists are atheists then any knowledge of atheism in a book is a primer. Indeed, most Christians dont' even know that atheism simply means non-belief in a deity not necessary a belief that a God is impossible. Now, while Harris's writings  have a mystical/spiritual component that the average book written by an atheist might not have. Now I am not defending (and I had subtracted from Mr. Harris book because of this) Harris's mystical side. I find it not rational (though maybe not as irrationl as Christian beliefs.) Most atheists don't have a mystical or spiritual side because most atheists are more rationale/logical then a belief in such things. Mr. Harris has been influenced by Eastern religions to a degree that no other renown atheist that I am aware.  Now, is secularism increasing in America? Yes, Surveys on American religious belief have shown an almost doubling of the number of Americans reporting nonbelief. The fact is that since the Middle Ages there has been a steady increase in secularism inthe West. Those who fought in the Civil War were a much more religious lot then even the average Christian conservative today. So, Mr. Harris and I are quite correct to state there is an end of faith, at least as we know it. Presidents for 30-40 years will continue to have to profess a belief in God but within 40 years or so it is possible that an atheist could seriously contend for public office. Now, will a Christian likely engage in a terrorist attack? No, but that has more to do with the Enlightnment Period that Christianity went then necessary something in Christianity itself. Islam, with an Enlightment of their own (with men like Paine and Madison and Jefferson) could be just as peaceful as Christianity. But the fact is not all members of the Christian religion are peaceful. There are people who have shot abortion doctors (while believing they were doing God's work). So, what Mr. Harris states might be unlikely but not impossible.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|I will always be a tremendous fan of the two part film version with Derek Jacobi and Sir Alec Guiness, now generally only found on used video tape. This wonderful new miniseries does however acquit itself very nicely. Shown earlier in the UK, the acting by Matthew Macfadyn (of Pride and Prejudice fame) captures the well-intentioned and kind hearted Arthur Clennam perfectly. Equally impressive is Claire Foy as the courageous and decent Little (Amy) Dorrit. Still the best may be the character portrayed by Tom Courtenay, William Dorrit, \\"the father of the Marshalsea\\" the famous debtors' prison. The series is full of very strong supporting performances, it would take far too long to list the many wonderful actors and actresses who are found in every scene.    The show follows a very typical Dickens plot of slowly developing mysteries and strangely interwoven relationships. Little Dorrit was born inside a debtors' prison and has lived her entire life working unendingly and without complaint to make her father's decades long imprisonment there more bearable. She is the first child born there; this fact and his former stature as a gentleman gives him an informal social superiority inside that he enjoys and uses as possible to his personal benefit. The arrival in London of Arthur Clennam from China to share with his mother the news of his father's death, pushes an already moving story into many surprising turns. Rich and poor, good and bad, people of all social circles find themselves pulled into confronting their changing fortunes. Some who find themselves well-off deal with their new situation far less well than those dealing with adversity.   Dickens is telling a story far too near to his own with the theme of these families forced to see many generations live behind prison walls for the want of a few pounds. The story is one of his strongest and this series tells it honestly and with an incredible strength of cast and script.
B0012GN3XM|5.0|I am writing this review just to point out that if you play side 2 first, rather than side 1, it will come across strong as a classic Santana album.  For the first few years Carlos put an airy instrumental track such as Batuka from Santana III and Singing Winds, Crying Beasts from Abraxas at the beginning of the LPs before getting into the songs.  After Borboletta he stopped doing that.  When you first play Zebop it starts off and sounds just like his previous 2 or 3 albums do through side 1.      However if you play side 2 first, starting with the airy instrumental 'Tales Of Kilimanjaro', suddenly you have broken the late seventies mold and it sounds as exciting as his early 70s albums.  And the instrument playing is fast, tight, dynamic and original.  On the CD, start play with Tales Of Kilimanjaro, track 7.  If you are playing it in your car, your CD player will automatically go to track 1 after completing track 12.  Just stop it after track 6 - 'Winning' - and you'll think you've just listened to what could have been his 4th album!  It's that good!
B000UX6THK|5.0|The best way to measure the greatness of a work of art is this:  if the world were destroyed tomorrow, and all that remained was the work of art, how much of the human universe - known and unknown - could be recreated from it?  How much pain and sadness and madness and ecstasy - how much guilt and glory and evil - could be recovered?  If all you had were the 28 episodes of Twin Peaks, I believe the answer would be \\"all of it\\".  Like Shakespeare, Dante, Proust, and the Bible, this show - masquerading as a murder mystery masquerading as a soap opera masquerading as a supernatural fantasy - is a panoptic document of the makes-your-mind-melt wonder, the contradictory and infinite diversity, of our world.    Obviously, the show is - foremost but superficially - a 'whodunnit' mystery.  As it progresses, new characters are brought in, new connections are established, and new questions are raised.  With each new character (there end up being well over 50, at least 25 of them \\"main\\" characters) what immediately smacks against your brain like a cold, hard handshake is how well-crafted, how unique, how **interesting** each one of them is.  All of them are very \\"real\\" people -- moreso than most \\"real\\" people are.  First impressions give way to second impressions, which give way to third impressions mirroring first ones.  In the end, to know more is to love more.  No two fans have the same favorite character, because each character embodies some different, equally appealing, facet of life; sometimes, more than that: the show's main characters are, to varying degrees, the entire human universe inside a single being.    But why stop there?  By the end of the show you will feel - to attempt to get meaning from a cliche - that you have actually BEEN to the show's distinctive, intriguing, and haunting milieus.  The sense of mood, of atmosphere, of sound (the soundtrack is a punch-your-fist-against-the-desk-cause-you-can't-describe-it miracle) are so hilariously superior to anything that's ever been shown on TV before (and, when I really think about it, on cinema screens and 99% of books) that it's like comparing \\"Hot Cross Buns\\" to Beethoven's 9th.  Watching it will ruin almost every other thing you see, since nothing can compare to it.    After all that, it doesn't need to be said that it's the greatest TV show I've ever seen, but I'll say it anyway, because it's the only thing I can think to say that even approximates my ineffable gratitude for, and fascination with, something which has scarred my memory with so much wonder and laughter and heartbreak, above all with beauty, a sense that every life - and even every place and every thing - has intrinsic interest and value.
1416914307|4.0|I really have to stop reading books out by the pool.  When I do this, especially with the good books, I forget about the thing called the \\"sun\\" and I end up getting roasted.  I should've known better yesterday when I sat down to read Cassandra Clare's CITY OF GLASS. I should've known that I was not going to be able to put down the book, and now, unlike Simon who is not affected by the sun, I am a little bit burned.<br /><br />It has been one really long - as well as crazy, heartbreaking, exhilarating, and anxiety-filled - month for Clary. She has been one busy girl - mixing it up with vampires, werewolves, and fairies, fighting demons, and falling in love completely and totally.  Like I said, it has been one helluva month for Clary.<br /><br />When we last saw her, both Clary and Jace were reeling from the fact that they were brother and sister.  I think you were able to hear a collective moan of \\"oh no\\" across the country when everyone reading the book got to that part.  On top of that, her mother was in a coma and Simon, her BFF, was turned into a vampire.  Seriously, can anything else go wrong?<br /><br />Welcome to the final chapter in THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS trilogy.<br /><br />The trip has been planned.  Everyone is going to the City of Glass, the ancestral home of the Shadowhunters.  Clary was going to save her mother, learn more about her past.  Life was going to be good once again.  However, keep in mind the saying \\"the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry\\"....<br /><br />So what goes wrong?  For starters, Jace doesn't want her to go, claiming that it is too dangerous, especially if people, the wrong people, find out what she can do with runes.  Then the Forsaken attack before Clary arrives, wrecking havoc and forcing everyone left alive (including Simon) to escape through the portal to Idris.<br /><br />It is not easy getting into Idris.  You have to get permission from the ruling body, and if you enter without permission, you run the risk of death. Uh oh.... now how in the world is Clary going to save her mother? Clave be damned is how, and she draws her own portal rune to transport her. Luke latches on at the last second in hopes of saving her, but it is too late - and they both wind up in Idris.<br /><br />Good news is they made it; bad news is that Downworlders like Luke aren't exactly welcome.<br /><br />The action in this installment starts early and doesn't let up until the very last page, but now with Clary, Luke, and Simon (who really shouldn't be there) in Idris, the twists and turns really begin.  If you thought what happened on the ship in the last book was intense, you haven't read anything yet.  Valentine, who has yet to show all of his cards, is planning something huge. He is just itching to use the mortal cup and he already has the sword.  Everybody is on full alert, ready to battle for his or her lives.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal that many spoilers, so lets just say Ms. Clare wrote a satisfying conclusion that will please her legions of fans. There is a lot going on in this book, that much I will say. This one was probably my favorite out of the three.  The story moved at a very good pace and delved more into the relationships that have entwined all of the characters together. Familial issues take center stage, and romantic issues also abound.<br /><br />There is also one really big surprise.  Does that mean Jace and Clary are together in the end?<br /><br />I'm not telling....<br /><br />Reviewed by:  coollibrarianchickgoing to save her mother?

B001R4MEYI|5.0|I'm not familiar with much of their earlier CDs...I've heard a couple of things here and there and liked what I heard, but wasn't sold on them...but I felt myself, for some reason, gravitating towards paying more attention to this band...not sure why, becuase, I rarely listen to  metal anymore... mainly 'cuase I got REAL tired of these \\"screamo\\" metal bands!!!! I decided to pick this album up becuase of the major buzz surrounding it and gave it a listen...then gave it ANOTHER LISTEN...aside from Metallica's best comeback album to date, \\"Death Magnetic\\", Mastodon's \\"Crack The Skye\\" is a splendedly 5-star crafted masterwork and will be THE metal/prog/hardrock band to watch and could be major contenders to take Metallica's long-standing crown!!! I don't see nothing wrong in a band stretching it's musical boundries such as Mastodon has on the new CD...long as they stay true to what they are trying to accomplish, and Mastodon has done just that. With \\"Crack The Skye\\", Mastodon have taken heavy music to a new level of creativity!! I would buy their next CD if they keep writing great albums like this!
B000VKW7AK|3.0|The music is great, but I had a problem with disc 1.  If I played the cd in my car cd player it worked perfectly fine, but if I played it on my pc the last 3 songs on the disc would stutter and skip.  Has anyone else run into this problem?  I also didn't care for the plastic outer sleeve packaging I had problems trying to get the cd's back into it.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|I discovered Mastodon in an effort to find a heavy band like Tool, that didn't scream all their lyrics or affect some doomy Halloween monster voice to get their point across. I love heavy riffing and chugging, but can't stand the screaming, which is why I won't give my money to Lamb of God.  Enter, Mastodon. I got swept away with their amazing musicianship, and learned to dig the gritty vocals, and Leviathan seemed to be their masterwork, but Crack the Skye looks like the evolution and perfection of all the bands' work before it, and the production, songwriting, and musicianship easily ranks this as a winner in Metal, Rock and Progressive, in one clean kill.  If you're looking to get into Mastodon, this is a great way to start, then get heavier and darker as you move backward. If you don't like this album, there are plenty of other bands laying it down nasty and heavy that you can stick with.  This album is a journey and a real gift to music at this time. So, what now with this band? Can't wait to find out.    Paully Walnuts-The Slackerprince
B001PPLIEG|1.0|To me, Quantum of Solace was a complete and utter letdown ! I saw and liked its direct predecessor Casino Royale, so my expectations were high. But I found some parts of QoS to be almost unwatchable. Did the editor go mad or was he doped up when he cut this movie? The action sequences comprise of extremely short, blurry images that pass with machinegun-speed. They produce an almost stroboscopic effect that literally hurts your eyes and numbs your mind and leaves you unsure of what's happened. At home, you can rewind the DVD player to watch it again. In the movie theater, you're hopefully lost. The result is a physically exhausting film experience after a mere five minutes of play. I almost switched the DVD-player off there and then. I know that the pace of (action) movies has picked up considerably since the nineties, and in general that is a good thing. But the pace of the action sequences of QoS is ridiculous and an insult to moviegoers. My young adult children (18 and 16) complained about this too, so thankfully I am not alone in this respect. Just lately, I began to fear that I have trouble coping with the increasing pace of today's movies because I have turned middle-age. Clearly this is not the case, then ! The action and violence in QoS is gritty and realistic, almost clinical. And I love Daniel Craig as the new JB. Five stars for him. But QoS the movie seems to have no discernible plot and what little plot there is is enigmatic (not in the positive sense), vague, illogical and lacks coherence. This quickly becomes annoying to the extreme. You never have an idea what's going to happen next and --most important--why. I am very happy with \\"the new JB\\" as portrayed by Daniel Craig, but QoS is definitely not the way forward with the JB-franchise.
