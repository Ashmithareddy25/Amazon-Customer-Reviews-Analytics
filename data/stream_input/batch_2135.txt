B0012YYZYK|5.0|Amazing sound and video quality of one of their most powerful performances ever. I recommend this for every led zeppelin fan.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie! great movie, definitely recommend that you watch it. Not even really a Leo Dicaprio fan, but still enjoyed it
B00B2V66VS|1.0|While the game is fun I noticed it changed my settings to allow in app purchases.<br />This is important for Parents . Since I download games for my childrens Nabi's I noticed this &#34;in app purchase&#34; I like to call in app fraud. You dont know untill your getting billed. First learned of this feature in &#34;angry birds star wars&#34; and started getting billed for 1.99 multiple times. Children only see getting &#34;coins&#34; but to parents its cash. I turned off this feature in my amazon app account. But when i downloaded temple run 2 , suddenly this setting was changed. I change the setting back and when I downloaded onto another pad and it changed the setting  again to allow in app purchases. This is pretty disgusting for amazon to allow this.
B00335EQ3Q|5.0|Hubby saw this movie years ago, loved it, got me to watch it, liked it as well, so had to finally get it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is very... how should I put it... real. it feels as though you are loving and training your very own horse.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is yet another instance of a game for which I didn't have the highest of expectations, but ended up more and more addicted to it. Be warned of that, but otherwise, get the game!!!
B002WIDRM6|4.0|A great mix of material.  The band and singing are first rate.  Would like to see them in concert live.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Easy to use puzzle app..... I like that you are able to choose the number of pieces for each puzzle...... Smooth sliding action with the pieces..... You can sort the end pieces separately to make assembly easier.....  Lots of themes to download...... A decent amount of free ones also.... Although I did buy the Halloween one for .99
B005OCFGTO|3.0|When I tried to view the 3rd movie, it was labeled as 'Prisoner of Azkaban', but the actual movie it contained was the Polar Express.  Weird!  The frustrating thing is that I have to return the entire set, then reorder to get the replacement.  I wish there was another way that is less hassle for the customer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cool! it is so realistic. it is a nice game to play in spare time. the funniest thing is that we can cuddle our horse
B002UHSDUK|3.0|There are a few songs for me that are &#34;OK&#34; and others Pretender that I love but I am glad that I did purchase it and do change up the songs in my playlist for a good variety.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|OMG I got so scared this game is AWESOME MY first try I saw something and I still haven't died on my second try I had 5 pages and I turned around and saw tentacles and turned around saved it and quit Damn lol
B008N9AASC|3.0|I bought this DVD because it wasn't staying at the theaters here in San Luis Obispo County, and I wanted to see it.  It was also not at the Video Stores.  I loved Ron Fricke's first movie Baraka.  It is one of my all time favorites.  It had a wonderful message, and was beautifully done.  The scenery and scenes are incredible.  Like Baraka, Samsara has no words but has music and some chanting.  The scenes and scenery are great.  However, they go too fast.  There didn't seem to be a message, just different scenes.  And there was music that didn't seem to fit sometimes.  For example, one scene had a man painting himself black in a kind of fake death scene.  There was Tibetan horn music playing along with the visual scene. It denigrated the sacred Tibetan music.  I felt this was totally inappropriate.<br /><br />It is worth watching if you like beautiful scenes.  it would be better if they identified where the scenes were.
B008BD9SI8|4.0|The return of Logan Nine Fingers: my favorite character from Mr Abercrombie's first book.  I devoured his debut trilogy and has set high standards.  This book is not in my top 3 but still a must read.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This works great and is a great solution if you have a Firewire 800 drive but only have Thunderbolt ports. You can still daisy chain your Firewire drives together and plug them all into one thunderbolt port. You are limited to Firewire speeds of 800 or 400
0385495323|2.0|A very interesting read when it comes to reading about different aspects of cryptography.  But several conspiracy theories have been accepted as historical truths.  If you believe the book, even the RSA algorithms and asymmetric keys was actually invented by the British but that they had to destroy all evidence to give themselves an unfair advantage. This, apart from what is claimed that every German code was broken by the British during the war. Infact it is claimed that throughout the war, the British were only trying very hard to keep up pretences of fighting a tough war. They would send in a reconnaisance plane before blowing up a U-boat whose location they, ofcourse, already knew.<br /><br /> I was wondering at one point, whether I would turn a page to find that it describes how the IPhone was actually invented just after the Second World War by the scientists working for the British cryptographic division (the men of Betchley park as described in this book), but that they had to destroy all evidence in order to keep things hush-hush.<br /><br />However, I still completed the book because the author is a good story teller, like the uncle you have who tells you interesting bawdy stories in a bar when both of you are drunk, and you listen to him even though you do not believe the truth of those stories. I have a strong suspicion that this is how the author got his tales. There is a certain amount of romanticism involved in stories of secret writing and ciphers. Usually, cipher solving is cryptic and difficult to understand. Simon Singh has a done a fantastic job making the codes often used in history understandable for layman, even those not mathematically inclined. Therefore, it is possible for every one to enjoy the art of secret writing by reading this book.<br /><br />I am not particularly sure of the historical accuracy of certain claims made in the book.. For example, for certain historical events like the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, she was alleged to have corresponded in secret with a conspirator who wanted to kill the protestant Queen Elizabeth and restore to the throne the catholic Queen Mary. But that allegation made by Walsingham, the spy master of Queen Elizabeth, was rejected by Mary. The letters used for the trial which were apparently written in code cracked by Walsingham's cipher expert could have been forgeries made by Walsingham's man under his orders. My reason for suspecting this is because frankly the letter allegation does not hold water. The letters were apparently written in code by the conspirator and Queen Mary apparently could break that code and reply in the same cipher. Since Queen Mary was not a cipher expert herself, how could she or her maids crack the coded letters from an English conspirator outside her castle prison without ever having met the conspirator and therefore never having had agreed on the cipher system being used. Also apparently that cipher was not a well known cipher at that time. And the possibility that the cipher key was passed along with the letter smuggled inside a wine barrel (as what was alleged) does not make sense because who would pass a coded letter and also the cipher key through the same channel of communication. Therefore, I believe that the letter story was a sham. It is just one more cleverly resourceful way of falsely accusing someone that we have often seen in history. Ofcourse, Simon Singh, the author of this book does not investigate whether the story of Queen Mary having used secretly coded letters to communicate with conspirators as claimed by Queen Elizabeth's spy master is actually historically accurate. The story was too \\"juicy\\" for him not to have included it in his book, even if the story might be actually historically inaccurate and the letters were forgeries used by Walsingham and Queen Elizabeth to murder her cousin, Queen Mary, who was a political threat to her. My condolences to Queen Mary of Scots though I am several hundred years too late.She would have made a good queen of free Scotland if she could have reigned longer.<br /><br />Another point, which I am not sure of in terms of historical accuracy is the Betchley Park story. All the documents and machines, allegedly made there during World War II, which apparently broke every German code used in German communications (including Hitler's comms to his generals), are said to have been destroyed. If there is absolutely no evidence left, except the claims of a few guys after about thirty years, then how can these claims be trusted? If all German code was broken during the war, why did the British have such a tough time fighting? Ofcourse, the author, Simon Singh, does not care. He gets another to story to write about.<br /><br />Despite the historical lack of credibility of the book, I enjoyed reading it as it helped me understand several codes used and raised my level of interest in the subject. The book highlights how important persistence is in all human endeavors.<br /><br />Desclaimer: I have read this book by borrowing from a library. I did not actually buy the book from Amazon. But I did want to leave my review because I felt I had some important things to say about it. Thanks for reading till so far down that you came to this line.She would have made a good queen of free Scotland if she could have reigned longer.<br /><br />Another point, which I am not sure of in terms of historical accuracy is the Betchley Park story.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it better than the original. I like all of the new challenges. well done, I cant wait for temple run 3!
B005HSL626|4.0|mY DAUGHTER HAS LOTS OF FUN PLAYING THIS GAME, IT HELP HER WITH HER COORDINATION SKILLS EYES AND HANDS GREAT TO HAVE AROUND EVEN FOR US ADULTS
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game which does not take that much Thought process. It is challenging but not to the point where you will get stuck and not advance. I got this application for free but if it is a paid application I would not pay more than a dollar possibly 2 on it. So far the only downside that I see from this game is you cannot pause and save the game that you are playing you have to Finish the puzzle or else all the progress you made Will be lost when you exit, what I mean is sometimes I play this game to kill time if I have 10 minutes to kill the game is halfway done I cannot pause and save. All in all it is worth it enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great virtual game....keeps me coming back to make sure my horse is well! Great to help give someone an idea of what it takes to keep horses.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I loved this book. On the tv show your always hoping they finally get together but never happens. It this book they do.
B0006GVJEE|4.0|Like a number of other reviewers, I own more than one version of Leon, including a UK Director's Cut, which I'd highly recommended because it contained scenes omitted from the US DVD releases, albeit only in the Extras. This edition has those deleted scenes included in the body of the film, and it really makes re-watching the film more enjoyable.<br />However, as this a 10th anniversary edition, the interviews are rather dated, so hopefully I'll be able to shell out for a 20th anniversary edition next year. The other problems I have with this is no Commentary track, and with the so-called \\"Facts Tracks\\" in the extras, which seem to have been assembled by someone who watches the E! Channel a lot, with entirely too many inane \\"facts\\"(such as the number of cabs in New York) when facts about the film and production would be far more informative. When Matilda and Leon check into the hotel where Matilda tells the desk clerk she has an audition at Juilliard, the name she gives to the clerk is MacGuffin, but whoever assembled the facts took no notice of what a \\"MacGuffin\\" is in film plots.....Keyser Soze should take care of whoever was in charge of this.(speaking of a MacGuffin)<br />Still, this is the best edition thus far....

B0058VW36U|3.0|Cute game but gets a bit boring after awhile.  Fun to start and does progressively gets harder.  I just don't have the time to figure it out.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I've used this as a check list and reminder app and it's been extremely helpful when there's no paper around...or when I don't want to waste paper.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love to be able to pull this up at a moments notice and do any calculations that are needed.  Will use again and again!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I have to reduce the screen in order to pull back the slingshot and aim it where I want.  This makes it difficult to see and if you touch it incorrectly the screen moves around.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I truly enjoyed this free app of the day.  The story line was intriguing and the graphics were very colorful.  My only complaint was that the puzzles were very hard and a couple of the scenes had items that were too small.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the app I use most of all when I just want some time out to myself and too tired to read.  Great stuff!
B005MSD6GU|5.0|Great story lines and acting.  One of my favorite TV shows.  If yo haven't watched Breaking Bad please do so immediately.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Definitely not my favorite Christmas CD, but their voices blend nicely and it is just a fun CD to listen to.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This film ,&#34;Pride and Prejudice.&#34; is so much better than two or three I have seen over the years.  It has an edge.  Elizabeth is a match for  Mr. Darcy.  There is one priceless scene in which Mr.Darcy proposes marriage to Elizabeth. Colin Firth paces back and forth like a caged lion, and when he blurts out his proposal he manages to demean both Elizabeth and her family.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is such a great movie! Got it at an awesome price over Black Friday/Cyber Monday, but I am happy to have the 3 disc edition. PLUS, this includes the 3 mini movies, which are hilarious! My kids love those but I couldn't handle buying a DVD just to have those, so it was great to have them on here.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Normally, I'm not that into horses but this game is super addictive! Just can't help but love the graphics, and the game itself is entertaining. Definite keep. :-)
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Simple Profound Magic!<br />Its a easy reading book that absolutely delivers what it promises. I for one am very grateful that I was shown a copy of this book. It has certainly made me a more grateful happier person<br />Thank you thank you thank you Rhonda!
1451695195|4.0|A excellent account of a near-death experience by a neurosurgeon. The experience went beyond anything that the author had encountered in his previous experience or training. Therefore this is a unique account of a near-death experience from one who would have previously debunked any such possibility.
B00846F1YW|3.0|Fun to pass the time, but doesn't have enough to keep attention for long term.  games very repetitive.  &quot;shadow&quot; search has sometimes blurry outlines which makes searching hard.  penalty for &quot;random tapping&quot; but seems a reasonable number of attempts before this limit is reached.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just like TEMPLE RUN but you have to jump on trains and you get more characters like I have Carmen but u have like 12 more days so you got to get it know<br /><br />  BYE HOPE U LIKE :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The interweaving plots the beautiful costumes and the superb acting have kept me at bay!<br />I can't wait to start watching Season 3!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|If you love horses like I do then this is the app to get. It's great and probably the closest thing to actually owning a horse.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I was so ecstatic when I opened my package and saw this beauty in near perfect condition. I definitely feel like I got very lucky with this order. 100% satisfaction!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a really good game. The only problem is that on a Kindle Fire you cant put it on best visual quality or else it wont open. But overall a great game
B0086449YA|5.0|This album is top notch. Mark is one of the few gifted artists that not only writes and sings good, meaningful songs but is a guitar virtuoso as well. This double album has gotten many listens and will continue to do so. Many lyrical and musical pleasures as you would expect from this artist. Celtic and rock vibes throughout. One of the best of the last year!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|The game was cute and fun. But I got to ten ponies and my whole game reset itself the next time I went to it. It didn't warn me, ask me, or anything. I was so mad.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Hello Kitty brings the pain in this installment that expands the barriers of the cafe genre.  I've been playing for forty straight days while stuck on this Ark. My wife says its not raining and she's tired of the animal feces, but that's just her lack of faith.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book seemed so natural and honest.Like someone just speaking their mind and having some of the s as me thoughts you would.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a  blast to play. great for kids of all ages 0-100. easy to play for my three year old even.
B00B8PMWJI|1.0|Almost half of these short segments are incomprehensible, pretentious art-school undergraduate crap that contain no horror and, for the most part, no coherent narrative at all. The worst offenders are artsy assemblages of slightly porny imagery set to a high whining buzz.<br /><br />The other half don't fare much better. For a few of them, we get weird fetish porn for people into farts, forced masturbation, and furries, and when someone is forcing their fetish on me, shouldn't I be the one getting paid? I mean, these are horrific, but not in a horror movie way, more in a \\"why did I just watch an anthropomorphic cat kick a bulldog until its balls came out of its mouth\\" kind of way.<br /><br />A few of them are a single crappy joke, told with little panache and zero horror.<br /><br />Of the 26 segments in here, there are maybe four that are worth watching (B,U,V,X), four that that meet minimal standards of quality while not being particularly exciting (A,E,P,Y) and the rest are various flavors of terrible.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go watch anything else any of these directors have done. Even folks like Adam Wingert and Ti West, who have made a few great feature films, completely crap the bed here. I would very much like at least 8 of my 10 bucks back.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers,I think that it is a lot of fun and very entertaining. I suggest people to play this game.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Yes its about cooking but really its about how to master and short-cut overly mysterious and complicated skills into faster easier processes. If you like TF, and I do, his unique approach which is way different than so much out there is pretty cool to tinker with.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game everyday and simply enjoy it... it's addictive in my oppinion and really fun... i hope other people enjoy this game as much as i do.
B005LAII80|5.0|Very under rated, awesome movie. Blu ray is good with some extras. Buy it if you like sci-fi action, you will love it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is a fun way to be entertained! I would have given it 5 stars but there is a few problems, for example when you start getting up to the 15000's, nd yu try to complete a roll or jump, it doesn't slow down when yur in the air. Other than that, it's an awesome app nd has tons of extras to unlock!
0345803507|5.0|What a fantastic series.  Quite different than I usually read, however, the story saved this from being just another &#34;sex&#34; book.  Great read!
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|James Taylor is one of the all-time classic greats.  He continues to put out good music decade after decade.  His is one of my go-to Christmas CDs.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I would recommend this movie to all, There is so much happening that its hard to stay focus on one item. Story is magnificent with a lot of talent to go with it. Something very different to the every day show and any age would show delight in watching, with unusual figures of the past, Figures of the very near future, Special effects are fantastic with the colors meeting and mixing  with one another. Movie is a must see, one you can watch several times and still enjoy. So what are you waiting for, grab your goodies sit and relax, so put your feet up while watching the marvelous entertainment before your eyes, you wont be sorry.

B007SGM084|5.0|This is the perfect twist of seduction, drama, romance, tragedy, erotica, and fun. The modern day fairy tale. The story can't be over! I could not put it down. I know I will reread the trilogy these books. It mixed very harsh reality with the 'only in my dreams' success. Great points of view and very knowledgeable. Great read.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|ok so I got this a while ago and like it. when I can get on. it is so slow but I love it when you can play!!!<br /><br />  I wrote this on another review. I hats this 20 word min.!!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|WOW! Just WOW!!! I think everyone should run, not walk, to get their copy of this book! It is an outstanding story of Navy Seal Adam Brown's life and ultimate sacrifice in service to this country. While this book's main focus is Adam Brown, it also brings to light the struggles and sacrifices of each military man and woman along with their families. I, for one, am thankful for the men and women who have fought and are fighting for the freedoms we tend to take for granted.
1451695195|4.0|This was an interesting book, thoughtt-provoking content.  It was easy to read.  Eben Alexander has joined other authors who have written about this subject, and there are groups discussing thiese topics.

B005M5OSBK|4.0|I came quickly and was in great condition. The majority of the songs are a re-hash of &#34;Sympathique&#34;, &#34;Hang on Little Tomato&#34; and &#34;Hey Eugene&#34;, though so if you have those discs already, you may benefit from just purchasing the individual new songs.

B008476HBM|5.0|I enjoyed revisiting  this novel which I read as a teen. The language was especially engaging. I recommend it to lovers of Victorian English.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is great! It is fun and addictive and keeps you wanting to play because there are different locations, limited time characters and more! When you lock the kindle while in the game and you open it the app does not work...it goes black. When I opened the app today all of my progress dissapeared. I had almost all the characters and a really good high score. I had completed the multiplier. the app has many problems with black outs and freezing. this is the first time it deleted my progress but I heard it has happened to others. All in all it is a fun app but don't waste your time because it willbe deleted and have problems. the app has too many bugs to spend hours getting acheivements just to lose it all. sorry
B009R9WAZ8|4.0|In November 2011, Rihanna released the successful album 'Talk That Talk' (which I consider her best to date) including the worldwide smash hit 'We Found Love'. During 2012, she also had the hit 'Where Have You Been' and made several live performances in events like Hackney Weekend instead of a world tour, although she teased that her next tour would be impactful and the best thing she has ever done. After that she opened the 2012 VMAs with a medley of the controversial 'Cockiness (Love It)' and 'We Found Love' and announced the dates for her new 'Diamonds World Tour'. At first some people thought it would support 'Talk That Talk', but then it was officially announced she was dropping a new album in November again. I was a little shocked at first, since 'Talk That Talk' wasn't hugely promoted like her previous albums, but I was still excited and looking forward to Rihanna's new direction. 'Unapologetic' was released in November 2012, and seems to resemble 'Rated R' qualities in it as well as well as bringing unexplored territory for Rihanna, making it a departure from her previous material. I'll review track by track and then give my conclusion:<br /><br />1. Fresh Off The Runway - The album's first track. This track opens the album 'Rated R' aggresive vibe to it, which I instantly loved when I first listened to it. It's very catchy and would be an amazing tour opener. An album highlight and one of my favorites. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />2. Diamonds - The album's second track and first single. The 'Unapologetic' era began with this emotional but hopeful ballad written by the amazing Sia. Rihanna's vocals are the best thing on this track, they sound emotional yet confident and much more mature than in other songs she's done. What I didn't like was the production, it could've been better. Despite that flaw, this track was another success becoming her twelfth #1 on Billboard Hot 100, so well done Rihanna! I give it a 9/10<br /><br />3. Numb - The album's third track.This song is a complete departure for Rihanna, since it doesn't sound like anything she has done before. This track sounds kind of experimental, which makes it more interesting. It features Eminem, who totally delivers this time. Another highlight and another favorite of mine. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />4. Pour It Up - The album's fourth track and third single. I believe this is the shortest track on the album, but it's very cool. It has a darker and more urban sound to it, kind of 'Rated R' style but without its raw style. I like it, but it should've been longer, its short length makes it feel out of place on the album. Not the best single choice. I give it a 9/10<br /><br />5. Loveeeeeee Song - The album's fifth track. The 7 e's in the title are probably on purpose since this is Rihanna's seventh album. It's again an experimental track and features Future, who is predominant in the track. It doesn't work so well with me, I hate how Future keeps repeating \\"l o v eeeeeeeee affection\\", it's annoying. I give it a 8/10<br /><br />6. Jump - The album's sixth track. It's a very upbeat and catchy song, I like it and it could make a great single, but it doesn't really make sence. I give it a 8.5/10<br /><br />7. Right Now - The album's seventh track. Definitely the catchiest and most commercial friendly song on the album, this is the closest thing to Rihanna's previous material and probably my favorite track on the album, this will probably be the fourth single. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />8. What Now - The album's eighth track. This track begins as a nice piano song, and then goes dubstep in the chorus. I would like it more if it was a piano driven only song, the dubstep makes it odd and a filler. I give it a 7.5/10<br /><br />9. Stay - The album's ninth track and second single. This is a very heartfelt song about badly wanting someone to stay and never go away, this is one of Rihanna's best ballads. It features Mikky Ekko, who makes the song even more amazing. They made a classy and flawless performance of the song together at the 2013 Grammy Awards. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />10. Nobody's Business - The album's tenth track. Another Chris Brown duet, after they both collaborated early in 2012 on the full version of 'Birthday Cake' and a remix of Chris Brown's 'Turn Up The Music'. I personally don't have the domestic violence in mind when I listen to their collaboration, I just see them as musical partners who have great chemistry between them. I love this song, it has an 80s, Michael Jackson vibe into it. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />11. Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary - These are 2 songs, an incomplete one and a complete one, which make up the album's eleventh track, so I'll review them separately:<br /><br />11.1. Love Without Tragedy - This is an incomplete track, I like its production and definitely would've liked a complete version. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />11.2. Mother Mary - 'Love Without Tragedy' seamlessly segues onto this track, which seeems to be complete and similar to the previous track. I personally think this track is just exaggerated, the song leads to nowhere and the lyrics don't make sence. This is the weakest track on the album and one of Rihanna's weakest from her entire career (even the songs from her debut album are better). I give it a 1/10<br /><br />12. Get It Over With - The album's twelfth track. It's a dark song, but instead of being interesting like the songs from 'Rated R', it has no substance and is just boring. I give it a 2/10<br /><br />13. No Love Allowed - The album's thirteenth track. This song revisits her Caribbean roots and resembles 'Man Down' from her album 'Loud'. I love this song's vibe, if it becomes a single I'd like to see a video sequel to 'Man Down'. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />14. Lost In Paradise - The album's fourteenth track. This is not a good ending to the album, it sounds too uninspired, Rihanna was really lost when she recorded this. 'Diamonds' would've been a much stronger and better closing to this album. I give it a 3/10<br /><br />I don't have the Deluxe edition so I can't review the bonus track 'Half Of Me', maybe it was a better ending to the album or maybe not. Anyway, this album is different to anything else she has done previously, it kind of resembles 'Rated R' but it's still a big change for her. I didn't like it as much as 'Talk That Talk', since it lacks the 2 strongest points of that album: consistency and big hits. 'Talk That Talk' was set to have smash hits like 'We Found Love' and 'Where Have You Been', this album lacks that, 'Right Now' could be the closest thing to that but it's not as strong. 'Unapologetic' is more experimental than anything, exploring different genres. This strategy works sometimes and sometimes doesn't, it worked with 'Numb' and didn't work with 'Mother Mary' in this case. This album is good, but not as good as other material she's had. Still, I'm sure the Diamonds World Tour will be as epic as she says it will be, Rihanna doesn't disappoint with her tours, I hope she also bring songs from 'Talk That Talk' since she didn't tour for that album which is her best ever. I give this albm a 4/5.
0143116738|5.0|This was a well written informational book.  It didn't feel like I was getting drilled with information, but more like I was getting useful incite about myself and others that Ken Robinson would talk about.  A good book to see the same stuff in a different light!
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|This movie is fantastic! David Tennant really steals the show with his portrayal of stage magician/vampire hunter Peter Vincent.  It will also give you a new appreciation for the melon liqueur Midori, and I suggest you drink some during the viewing. In summary an instant vampire classic that will be enjoyed for generations.
0060589280|5.0|This book turns into a quick read, because once you get into it you can't put it down.  Paulo Coelho writes so the reader can feel or question ones-self along with staying connected to what could or will happen next in the book.  I would recommend this book to male or female readers.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What more can anyone say about Adele. Terrific CD, there may be one or two songs that I didn't care for but all and all, great listening.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|The CD was good from song one to 12, would recommend to anyone that likes to hear the depth of some well known songs.
B008XOXGCO|5.0|Great CD, love every cut on this one. I recommend purchasing this one. I don't think you will regret it.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|With this Blu-ray set you get 5 versions of the movie and loads of extras. The extras and work print of this classic movie make this a film student's dream. Even if you don't plan to watch all 5 versions of the film, this set is sure to please anyone who enjoys great cinema. Best of all, it will fit on a shelf or in a drawer with the rest of your Blu-ray collection. I have the Blade Runner suitcase edition but this digibook set is perfect for my limited space. This is a must own Blu-ray, that I'm sure fans will watch over and over to appreciate the stunning cinematography, cutting edge effects, and soulful soundtrack. Harrison Ford and Sean Young are fascinating to watch in this retro-futuristic thriller.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Fantastic. Music is great and I love Cher and Christina together. There is not one bad song on the entire CD.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|A great story that makes you think about stuff that I didn't know really matters. Friends, life, lovers, paths and choices.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As a family, we read Riordan and any series in which he is involved with writing. This book is another of many books of his in which we have read. We will continue to read more.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Brave is among the best animated films I have seen. Technically amazing but that technology doesn't get in the way of the story which is charming and engaging. My only concern is that it is very fearsome in parts and I would not recommend  to children under 6...
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Hard to use. Can't turn the ringer on/off. The bottom cover is already cracked off as well as a crack on the top left. Not practical, at all. But it'll keep your phone screen from cracking.
B004SIP9RO|4.0|Yes it is predictable and even cloying at times but if you just go with it the film is charmingly romantic. Who doesn't fantize about fate and destiny in their relationships.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|it is awesome because there is so much more stuff. Also you have a lot more things you can get.
B005Z28M58|5.0|Excellent Series....too bad it has been cancelled..I bought the whole series to be able to watch it over and over again.  I totally love these women and the show was excellent.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It was a very good and entertaining book. I did enjoy the interviews of each of the survivors told! Some parts pretty scary... gave me nightmares! LOL!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time series.  I watched it always and miss getting it on my channels!  Had to have it!
B006ZN7KMM|5.0|Outstanding Service and excellent Follow-up. Online shopping, what a great to buy a book and the service that Amazon provides is the best.
B0058YPILY|5.0|This is also that best series ever....I only watch a few shows on tv and this is one of them.  I love watching it over and over again.
1439153663|1.0|I'm sorry, but I found this book to be one of the worst books I've read in a long time.  It was so sappy and so boring.  I could hardly wait to be done with it.  My book group is reading it and I can hardly wait to see what they think of it.  So far, I've  talked to one member of the group who agrees with me.  She said and I agree, \\"how in the world did this book get published.
B00006JI11|5.0|I love this movie, watched it a long time ago when it was first on and thought it was great.  I love it.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I chose five stars for Castle 1 and 2 because they are GREAT! I recommend everyone to watch it.  The whole family can watch it together. Amazon was the only place that i could find the series 1 and 2 and so glad I went there to find them.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|This was a good movie, however, it wasn't long enough.  IN other words, it needed more of a story line, but it was good.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|This song is so befitting to be a ringtone! Love it and I keep playing it over and over again.
B00684J49U|5.0|This is also that best series ever....I only watch a few shows on tv and this is one of them.  I love watching it over and over again.<br />I will continue to buy each series.
B007V65R54|4.0|I've been a fan of Nate Silver since early 2010, and what has struck me is the same thing that has struck him- that *anyone* can do what he does and draw his conclusions, yet nobody does. His methodology is damned basic, yet in the areas that he studies most (baseball and politics), superstition and the laws of public discourse (ie he who shouts the loudest is hear the most), his conclusions appear magically precise.<br />As I said in the title, the book reads as much as a textbook, spending the first few chapters laying out his backstory and basic Bayesian theory, before he details his insights on politics, baseball, and (most interestingly) climate change. That being said, he does write well, and his book is insightful and not at all sludgy to read.
B0098WZDZ8|2.0|I have purchased all the Deluxe Editions so far. I want the series to continue, but this \\"On Stage\\" is probably the weakest of the bunch so far. (Followed by Long Live Rock N Roll.)There are errors with the songs,(Duplicate material) there are problems in the performances (Blackmore's delay wasn't working during the first solo on \\"Catch the Rainbow\\" or something strange was happening. It sounds like he just stops and starts a few times and it is very odd. As for the remastering the sound is \\"ok\\" but it is no revalation. I think the remastering helps the drums more than anything else. It is very hard to reccomend this at close to $30. I would say it is for the completists only. Someone dropped the ball in checking the final product as there is duplicate material and erroneous source dates listed. It's just not worth the high price tag. The import live CD's from the German tour are the way to go for your live Rainbow fix. So far my favorite Deluxe Edition is \\"Down to Earth\\" followed by \\"Rising.\\" What a shame they can't find the multis for \\"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow\\" as that is my favorite album from Rainbow.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|we like to recycle and have ended up with too many bottles to will turn some into vases, candy jars, lights, mobiles, suncatchers, cups.... to give as gifts.
B004OT2WKO|5.0|Great Lego product that will entertain your children for hours both putting it together and playing with it after construction!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What more could be said about this flawless series. Yes, if you want to own Downton, and who wouldn't, this is just perfect...buy it, watch it and share it with others....the perfect gift for you or someone else!
B00795P4EG|2.0|Well when I got this app and watched the video I thought it was the greatest app in the world!! But when I got it, it kept closing out back to the main menu and that was annoying but other things on this app it's pretty cool but not what I was expecting!! But you can get it but if I were you I would get another app!!<br />And it wasn't really worth 99 cents
B004Y042N8|5.0|I love this game really exercises your brain. I love this game but i have completed all levels. Where<br />Is the update? Or new puzzles ..im waiting!! Lol
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|Castle is funny. Kat is serious. This mix is perfect for a good time mystery. I like to laugh while watching TV.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this one as well as the brides flow free. Works my brain. I love it and its highly addictive..
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The soundtrack from the movie is great.  The music is difficult to get out of your.  Brings memories of the the great movie.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Hollywood could never make a movie such as this. No sex, violence or swearing. Great acting by everyone with a plot that makes you think about what you really want to make out of your life.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|First Nicholas sparks novel I've read, it captivated me and made me a fan. I will be reading the rest if his books now. This was so touching.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|This is the best live concert I have ever seen or heard before. The sound quality is amazing and so is the video, and every performance is top rate. I highly recommend this Celebration Day Led Zeppelin combo.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I didn't think this game was any fun, but after a few minutes it got more and more addictive. Recommended.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|just what is needed for the upgrade of my older laptop. just plug it in and go after to put the cover back on
3836501899|5.0|A wonderful book... especially at this price ! A collection of images I have never seen. You can not go wrong buying this book.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I prefer this over the recent movie. It is, after all, a musical. they should have used singers in the latest production.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I think this is an excellent and gripping film and worthwhile seeing for older children, teenagers and adults. Most of all, it is about a young Hindu boy's spiritual journey, and for me the main theme is how he grew to give complete surrender to God for control of his present and future. There is a wonderful balance of humour with the tragedy and suspense in the film. The joke about his name is slightly vulgar, but funny all the same, and so typical of some little boys. I totally understand some people's concerns about the different religions mentioned, and there is a slight leaning toward the idea that all religions are equal. However, as his father says in the movie--you have to choose one road and to choose all of them is to have nothing!<br /><br />There are many Christian references contained in the film. These include Pi saying that he found Christ, the priest quotes John 3:16, Pi is shown praying and seems to pray to accept Christ, he says grace before every meal and says amen, mention is made of Jesus' Sacrifice and how He died for the sins of many when He had not sinned, the fact that he refers to himself as Catholic first, and his request to be baptized. The way I take it is that he still has his East Indian culture, but identifies himself as a Christian.<br /><br />It's a movie that can be appreciated on many different levels, and there is symbolism in the story, if you choose to see it. I wish I could get some other people's feelings on the symbolism of the tiger. To me he was representative of the boy's family with whom he was on a life journey, but they didn't get to say goodbye and to say thank you for all they had meant to each other. The tiger gave him life in many ways, and so did his family.<br /><br />As you're probably gathering, this movie can be taken in many different ways. This is not a movie for young children due to the graphic nature of the ship wreck, some of the animal deaths, and how scary it is in some places because of the tiger living with him on the boat in the middle of the ocean. Also, take your motion sickness pills before going. After about an hour on the sea, I really started to feel it, ha ha. The 3D effects and cinematography are really quite stunning and if this movie doesn't win some Oscars I will be very much surprised.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about the performance of Suraj Sharma who gave a brilliant acting performance. He is so believable as Pi and with this being his first film, I'd say he is a natural actor. Pi's romance is absolutely adorable as well.  As a Canadian I loved the Canadian reference to Winnipeg. Apparently the writer of the book is a Canadian.  I'd highly recommend this film which is brilliantly directed.ng with him on the boat in the middle of the ocean.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Such a page turner! And as always, better than the movie. Well done, Chbosky. Well done.
B008BO61BE|5.0|Brought back great memories.  Solid CD and DVD combo.  They don't make bands like this anymore. Great Deal - Great Price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book ever loved it<br />My favourite part was when they both are in the cave I love it
B00005R62N|5.0|Brought back great memories.  Solid CD and DVD combo.  They don't make bands like this anymore. Great Deal - Great Price.  Green Manalishi is the BOMB!!!!
B007EDCWHA|3.0|It gives you a really detailed perspective on the life as One Direction. I read Harry Styles' life and I was shocked about how much I didn't know about him.
B000002GJH|4.0|Good early stuff for both Chris Cornell and Eddie Vedder.....it truly was the beginning of a new wave of music..
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Honestly, the book is nothing I thought it would. It is so much more. It is really just amazing. A story I can relate too. Just not as harshly. Nicholas Sparks really did it again. If you read his novels often you know the feeling you get. You are overtaken by the words he describes to you. You feel Katies fear, and you feel the love. It's just rudely an incredible story with many emotions.
B003AYPMBU|5.0|Brought back great memories.  Solid CD and DVD combo.  They don't make bands like this anymore. Great Deal - Great Price.
B0048WQDIE|4.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B0096JD7W4 Snaggler's Paradise (Wickedly funny... Mark Rainstone Reviews)]] (highly recommended) put it, \\"Being crazy is the only sane thing in the world.\\" Joseph Heller's Catch-22 has stood the test of time. Regardless of a wartime setting, the novel's strength is about the offbeat characters that inhabit Heller's world, most of whom reside within us all, or those around us. A lasting piece of work and a good read.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I installed this on my kindle fire but it would not open after the first or second time I played it. I have truer to re-install but it does not work. not worth my time :(
0715338153|5.0|I love the style of the Tilda dolls.<br />They look so cute around the house as decorations.<br />The best thing is they are decor I don't have to worry<br />about my grandkids knocking them over or playing with them.<br />It's a great way to get several of Tone Finnanger publishings<br />in one book.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Good game. The only complaint I have is I would like to see a game advertised as free be just that. free. it seems you can get along fine in this game but if you wish to advance quickly you have to pay money for coins or whatever. aside from that its a pretty decent way to pass some free time.
1446303314|5.0|I love the style of this author, Tone Finnanger.<br />I'm just beginning to get back into sewing and these<br />patterns are very inspirational.<br />She is a very talented designer.
B008SOS63S|5.0|The best blues music I've heard in years.  I also enjoy Beth Hart's vocals on this CD.  Will be purchasing more music by these two
B005HSL626|3.0|I was playing this game and it just crash and never worked after like 15 months what happened!I love this game but not the quality
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Very different from any of the many tv series I have!! Most shows of the; &#34;If you've seen one, you've seen them all!!&#34;
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The book was very inspiring. I loved the way they looked at each others problems to help them get through the rough times.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|My son is obsessed with clocks and telling time lately. He saw this watch when I was browsing online and said he would really like to have it. I did not give him the extra little parts that came with it, just the basic watch. It was easy to size to his wrist by snapping out a few of the pieces.  Stays on well and is surviving him banging it around at school and everywhere else we go.  Arrived quickly from seller :)
B008DKBO8G|5.0|Fits my paperwhite like a glove. Keeps it from getting banged and scratched around.<br /><br />It's a sleeve. Does it's job well. Didn't want to spend what they're charging on the official cases because:<br />1. I like my kindle naked while reading it, so having it attached to one of those would be cumbersome for me.<br />2. I'm stingy like that.<br /><br />Don't know what exceptional qualities you could attribute to a sleeve but I have no complaints about it. Have had it for around a month and it looks in exactly the same as the day that I bought it and expect it to for a long time.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This film was artful and hilarious.  The cast was was second only to the cinematography. Defintely worth the rental, maybe even purchase for your preseonal collection.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read this book months ago while it was still a work in progress available for free on the author's website.<br />The author really did a great research job for creating the main character (who is a mechanical engineer/botanist/astronaut with a great sense of humor). The science of everything he does and the environment he lives in and his efforts to survive on the surface of a dead planet is very well presented and explained.<br />Since the story takes place in the not-so-distant future, it intertwines very nicely with many aspects of our actual space program and the knowledge of our neighbor planet we have at the moment.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to everyone who has even the slightest interest of mankind's current and future real-world endeavors in space. It is more akin to reading Sagan's speculations for the future of humans in space than Star Wars/Mass Effect space-opera type of sci-fi. So if you're expecting starship laserbeam dogfights against evil aliens from another dimension (which I'd be totally down for), you might want to look elsewhere.
B0086700CM|5.0|Honestly the first temple run is WAY better than temple run 2. I definetly recommend this app to anyone who is looking for a fun game.

B009RX7WTI|5.0|I have purchased every season of Grey's and have watched every episode. While some are better than others, what series does not have it's up's and down. I know that some years, the series will end & I surely want to see the final episode when it comes. I consider Grey's Anatomy to be a cross between a medical drama and a soap opera - but I find it very entertaining to watch.

B00915G6SU|5.0|Criminal Minds is a GREAT series. I watch most everything on &#34;video-on-demand&#34; so I can get away from the commericals but obviously, CBS thinks is a great series as well as they won't release it to &#34;video-on demand&#34; so I DVR it every time a new episode comes on. I have watched every episode of this series and have every season on DVD. I wish I could get them all on digital in a cloud so rewatching them would be easier. I will definitely continue watch every episode of this series.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is really fun and way better than the first but once I left the app and tried to get back in, it froze on the front screen and wouldn't let me in.
B000002LEM|5.0|The boys did really good on this album. Everything about it is great. I just miss David! He made the band come together.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is AMAZING. You get chased by one big monkey. It has great sound effects, So look in to getting it.
B0027MJU00|3.0|The story keeps you intrigued. I do not, however, think it's worth$10. You can't really connect with any of the characters. There is not one good person in this book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Originally got on Nook Tablet so when i upgraded  to Kindle fire i had to have it.  been playing it for two months
0062082353|4.0|I thought this was a good book. It tells a good bit about the decisions soldiers have to make between family and country. It's even more riveting hearing about some of the stuff he went through at war and knowing how his life was taken for no reason while trying to help a fellow vet here at home. I definitely recommend it.
0060751967|5.0|I loooooove this book!! It is one thaf you can read over and over again!! I actually love this whole series and recommend it to the max!

1451695195|2.0|[[VIDEOID:a1adf0f7ebb895c4182be8339832683c]] Is a Harvard doctor a better evangelist than a preacher, a popular novelist, or a Hollywood movie screen writer? . The popular trend of writing about Christianity seems to be an alternative or a backlash from the witchcraft of popular fiction, which made the pagan religion of Wicca popular.  The British invasion of American pop culture has a non fiction option pertaining to the afterlife and the supernatural.  This book claims to have some fact about the physiological function of the brain as an organ and how it perceives death and heaven. The mind is two parts, the physical brain with flesh and blood and the psychological part where religion hallucinations, delusions, and culture affect the human understanding of what happens when we die.  The body shuts down and certain physical things happen such as the infamous tunnel of bright light, which some people think is heaven.  However heaven is based on faith.  Christians are not the only people who believe in a peaceful happy place, there are other religions that are proponents of a tranquil heavenly state.  Fiction writer Christina J. Easley has included dreams in the concept of Christianity while neurologist and scientist have explained dreams as part physical and part psychological. Dreams might be an explanation of what people see when they die; just one final dream.<br />[...]

B00BESJYAY|5.0|I have always been fascinated by the art of surfing, but this movie goes far beyond the theme of great surfing.  It is a true story of finding life's passion and overcoming the fears that hold us back from realizing our dreams.  It is a story of finding the connection to the one thing that gives your life meaning and purpose, even if it means risking your life or even losing it to feel part of something greater than yourself.  Great movie, I really loved it.
B00005K3O4|5.0|VERY campy....Not scary at all......Very funny.. ...You will love the special effects...Just watch it.. you won't be disappointed!!........THANKS so much...Kerry

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|read the book to fined out what all the fuss was about. i read it before the move came out. sitting in my living room bowling like a baby. my little sisters thinking i have gone nuts because i am not a crier be any definition of the word. cried at the reaping and wen Rue died. love the first book. saw the move it was good not stellar but moves never stack up well to the books for me because of all the things they have to leave out or change. so i am reading it again which is another thing i rarely do and I'm crying again. rely rely good book. my only complaint is how you took a very strong female lead and turn her in to a barley sane wimp at the end not that i blame Katniss. everything plus the kitchen sink get thrown at her.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this series because it makes you feel like you're there. I didn't think the books could get any better but they definitely did. You should read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Three levels in and I can officially say I love this game. I do experience some hiccups with jumping but I can't tell if that's me or the game. Otherwise good graphics and great music.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My five year old son really enjoys this game. It keeps him entertained for hours! The black suit is pretty cool too!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I don't know how I would get along without this app. It saves my life on a regular basis. I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a really fun game and I recommend it if you are a horse lover. The graphics are also really nice
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this website and it is a very easy and friendly app to use. Glad I downloaded this app.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy this game. It's fun &amp; addicting. It's relaxing too. It reminds me of the fair. I just wish that it gave more coins. Definitely recommended.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I did not like this app. It would not load up the news feed. I found it much easier to use the web browser.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|my granddaughters watch this at least once a week if not more,  the movie arrived on time as quoted when purchased  very good service
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am so addicted to this game best game ever great fun for the whole family.we have this app on all our device's
B007XF4J70|5.0|Great movie time and time again and AWESOME that its on bluray, Its a great quality at a great price and shipped out to me rather quickly. They need to format more classic films to bluray.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Felt the book moved along at a stead paced until Prim got killed, and did Coin really put her on the front line, where was the mother? Then it felt like it hit its peak and quickly went down hill with lesser explanations.  I would have liked more of the story with her hooking back up with Peeta. Waited a long time for the thought to be presented again.
B003E74B24|4.0|Quick and easy read.  Reading this book allows a look inside the Gordon Ramsay everyone thinks they know.  Definitely a must read for any Ramsay fan.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books ever.<br />It changes you. Even if it's only for a few minutes<br />I think you can relate to some parts of the book in one way or another
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Thanks amazon, the best price and arrived to my home very soon. I live in Mexico and I know this is the best deal you can take if you want this vynil box.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. It is addicting but fun. You could earn so much coins. This is not a waste of money.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Very well written, and if you are a fan of the show you will easily associate the book characters to their TV show counterparts. The story could have easily been ripped from an episode script that was never recorded, would be the right length as well. Would I have liked it to have been longer? For the price, yes. Will that keep me from purchasing the rest of the series? No, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0083Z614S|2.0|I loved this<br /><br />! In first grade I saw the movie for the first time but this is a thousand times better!
B00000DCHI|5.0|It is hard not to sing along with Piano Man - this really does cover the best and it is hard to try to sleep when the tunes keep running through your head.
1616550414|5.0|Finally I received my Hyrule Historia and so far so awesome I'm in love with it.! I definitely recommend this for all Zelda fans.! <3
B000002AGN|5.0|If I had to rebuild my library this would be first. This is one of the few albums that seems to quiet a room every time it is played.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It's not one if the best diary of a wimpy kid books but it's a good one, I recommend to any who likes humor to get this
0446580848|3.0|I'm a DeMille fan mostly. However the Corey character in the Panther has become flat out irritating. It is as if someone brought their smart-aleck 15 yo kid to work and every exchange was punctuated by a snide remark. It is so over the top I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to finish the audiobook. I liked the character from the Plum Island and The Lion but this is different, way different. I can't say I like the character anymore.
B001JQD0Z6|5.0|That is right this is a novel about the history of philosophy. It was written by Norwegian professor Jostein Gaarder. Gaarder Now writes other novels and has a large following. I personally found it fun to read and intriguing.<br /><br />Some readers may think the ending is a little strange however it fits the story perfectly. This novel is used as an introduction point to philosophy. So it would not be appropriate for those that already have a background in philosophy to dismiss this as sophomoric. Everyone has to start somewhere. If you are already a philosopher then it is still an interesting novel with an interesting twist.<br /><br />Receiving a mysterious letter in the mail, Sophie Amundson is about to embark on a mysterious journey that is mosty correspondents and may become mutch more. We get to join her on her discoveries.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001R88C6I The Thirteenth Floor [Blu-ray]]]
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Starts and jitters 28 minutes from the end..conclusion...thus very poor video experience....refund would be most gladly accepted..I thank you in advance
0425252868|5.0|This is an incredible account of war and warriors, and how they can interact in unusual, if not unpredictable, ways.  It shows that humanity and mercy has a place, even in warfare.  It's hard to imagine this kind of thing could happen in today's world of high-tech, high-speed modern warfare.  Adam Makos played no favorites in this story -- no good guy, no bad guy.  He did his research well and told the story in a straightforward manner.  The brief interaction of two warriors at one moment in time, and the mercy shown by one of them, is moving in ways that cannot be described.  Read this book.  You won't be disappointed.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Friggin awesome loved it from start to finish couldn't put it down its a def must read book for all
B000W9179M|5.0|The most amazing search for one's guardian angel, an inspiring manifestation, and the most intriguing group of helpers - the Valkyries.  I won't tell more because the story is worth every revelation.
B007HB5TN8|5.0|This is a book I have read at least 2 or 3 times before ; If you are a fan of Jane Austen you know what I mean!<br />She is so talented and clever in her writing ,you never tire of it !<br />The proof of a classic is never having to use sex scenes or foul words to get the story across .;If you long to daydream of a gentle time !  You will love Jane Austn !
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Left behind and alone, this is an amazing story of ingenuity in the service of survival.  Very interesting, very clever.  Even though I feel the plot could benefit from a bit more character developement, the fast pace of calamities served up by the fierce Martian climate keeps the interest all the way to the end.  When death seems everywhere, making it through one more day is an epic achievement.  Imagine a whole year.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|This Album is the greatest! Beth is a breath of fresh air and Joe has to be the best guitar player Ever.<br />Can't wait for a new DVD to come out.
B000JMKNZQ|3.0|This is a series, a very long series, of wisdom statements each of which are worthy of reflection and further thought.  However, there are so many that at times I have to take break to have them settle in my mind.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Watched again last night.  The story line, the continued dive into who Bond is where he came from and what makes him Bond 007
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really do love this game. It is a great game for kids or teenagers to get on dream out to get a horse.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Love the movie, characters and everything about this. The 3D is pretty great as well. Though don't expect cheesy 3D. It's subtle and just adds to the enjoyment.
B001EBWITA|1.0|I saw this billed as a \\"super hero\\" style movie. I read the description, and was hesitant to watch it, but it had a fairly high rating, and I could sort of imagine a guy with \\"super powers\\" to kick some demon tail. What I got instead was a rather depressing, horror flick. To me the story line stunk. This could have been fun. It had good special effects, yet it managed to depress me and bore me. Really disappointed!
B009IA3O2O|5.0|I won't lie, I am not a major music connoisseur; I just like what I hear. When it comes to symphonic metal Kamelot is legendary for good reasons. Fantastic vocals and well written lyrics than tell a story as well as play one. I was first introduced to this band with Epica and my adoration only intensified with the release of The Black Halo.<br /><br />It must have been difficult to follow up on such a stellar album, I'll concede that, and Ghost Opera was a commendable effort. However when Poetry for the Poisoned came along I felt dread creeping in. Although it was certainly a Kamelot album it failed to capture me as a listener. It lacked the sophistication and memorable sound of Kamelot that is a part The Black Halo and even Ghost Opera. But enough of that: for those who felt similar to what I have felt, or in the very least can understand my hesitation with the release of Silverthorn, rest assured. Silverthorn is what we've been waiting for, what -I've- been waiting for, since The Black Halo.<br /><br />Listen and enjoy Kamelot fans, you're in for a great album.<br /><br />EDIT: I forgot to add that, although Khan has departed the band it's not all gloom and doom for Kamelot. He will be missed, but they will persevere. TY Roy Khan for all the good years.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My niece recommended this book to me.  It had so many twists and turns.  Always kept my interest.  Re-read it to see where I missed the clues.  The highest compliment I can give:  I will be recommending it to my book club members and will be reading more of this author's books.
0061122416|5.0|This is a great book. Very enlightening. It's certainly something that I can see myself reading again and again, just for insight.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|It's good and has pretty good graphics . But glitches about a week or so other than that it's okay.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Literally the first thing I do when I get on my Kindle is to play Coin Dozer. I am useless until all my coins have been dozed. It gets more fun the longer you play it because as you gather prizes, various special things will happen, such as more high value coins will drop, you will win prizes that fall off the sides, etc. Very fun and addictive game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't stop watching.  Everything from production to acting to storyline is superbly done.  Can't wait for season 4.  word
B000EQ4498|5.0|Love Bach, her improvisations are brilliant, full of passion and grace. Another favorite treat for the senses. Cannot tire of it.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|If you tend to stay on the short bus you may want to steer clear of this game. Controls are simple to grasp. Yeah it is not flat, that was pretty clear in the description. A nice change from the million run of the mill mahjong on here. That said I would like to see a little finer controls and punch up the tile graphics. This is a great start to what could become a really good game. I enjoyed it.
030758836X|5.0|I haven't read it yet, but my wife just loved the plot and the way the book read so easily. She doesn't like books that tend to be confusing in plot.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|the first half was great, but it seems the in the 2nd half they are using the gap between air dates to infer some things that never happened. this works fine now but won't hold up in later blu-ray / season streaming marathon runs
0345803485|5.0|Came much faster  than expected.  Have the other two volumes so now my set is complete.  Much more enjoyable when  one has the whole set.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|great show I want more, amazon give me more. While your at it you should work to make Homeland, Dexter and Game of thrones as 1 day after air like the walking dead is.
B001U3ZMHW|5.0|Battle for Endor<br />  It arived in great shape and very fast. No complaints here, my daughter loved it for her Bday
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|hilarious and inappropriate. it was awesome. Sadly though my 10 year old brother turned me on to this movie. guess I'll have to talk to mom about better screening of his entertainment media
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game. But I think that when you play this game that it is very hard to control where you are going. I don't know if that is because I have something touch screen and that makes it harder to control but that is my opinion on this game. Otherwise it is one of my favorite apps on my kindle.
0393340244|5.0|We written and well researched. Will make you think about stereotypes and nature vs nuture. A must read for all.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this and I have no complaints. I think this game should have more levels for each box though.
1439102732|5.0|An up-to-date controversial issue that gently has the reader asking, &#34;How would I feel in this situation?&#34;  A great book about people doing what is right.
B004XWLN20|4.0|I am an avid Smallville fan. When I received this in the mail. The box holding the disk booklets was tore at the closed end, so the booklets slipped through the tear. I used scotch tape to fix that problem, so it wasn't too big of a problem. The booklets' designs were a little confusing. The disks are held tightly in the sleeves, and if you try to hard to get one out, it may become heavily scratched; therefore, I bought a $10 disk case and transferred the entire collection to the disk case. I am fairly satisfied with this purchase because I have all 10 seasons now. So, if you are looking for the show and not the extravagance, this a great space-saving item--compared to having all 10 individual seasons.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was riveted from the first page.  Scarey to think about how close to reality this could be and how sad the human mind can do such a thing.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Very simple, but also enjoyable. I found it to be filled with lovely and kind characteristics in very agreeable characters I like that it follows the same story as originally published
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I bought this to self-record videos where I'm facing away from the camera - making it hard to pick up clear dialog. It works flawlessly and gives another bonus I had not thought of - it blocks out annoying background noise like passing airplanes and the neighbor's barking dog!<br />It makes VERY nice clear audio, a BIG improvement over the built in mic on my camcorder. It also has a nice long 20' cord, which is ample for most any use. Audio Technica makes well made quality products. For the price, it's a very good value and I recommend this mic highly for most any use.<br /><br />Just be sure to remember to turn the switch on and off!
0767827902|4.0|The Last Picture Show arrived far earlier than expected and was in fantastic shape. I ordered for my daughter, who is taking a film class and Amazon is my &#34;go to&#34; spot to find old classic movies. I am never disappointed!
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|very good acting, and the drama pulls you in to the struggle. I was unaware, as most are, that this even happened. May it never happen again.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I ordered this DVD for my daughter who was taking a film class. The movie arrived a head of schedule and was in perfect condition.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Heaven, all of them ready for more.  I keep them with me.  Excited for the next but sad to see the Dance end
B009EEFTMC|4.0|The 3D on the game is simple but neat, no confusion, good tactile precision, don't worry about fat fingers. Challenging, but not that much that is frustrating. Keep up the good work!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The Dark Knight shows Batman in a different perspective. He still fights crime knowing the knowledge of that criminal but this time he takes a different style that works for him but backfires in the long run.  Great movie!  See it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Really enjoyed this book series, was great series for adults and kept you wanting to read more of the book.
B005G4TJUC|3.0|Sometimes it's best to stop after the sequel. Too many sequels can ruin a good thing. Although entertaining enough, at the end of the movie you feel a liitle cheated and disappointed. Some of the recurring actors seem to over do it, and some just seem to be a little tired of the whole thing. Best part of the movie are the Transformer machines. All-in-all, it's not bad to watch but it definitely don't live up to Transformers 1 & 2.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really enjoyed this book series, was great series for adults and kept you wanting to read more of the book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book, even through my tears. Young love, despite the inevitable pain that was guaranteed to hurt, in its truest form. Be sure to have your tissues handy.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|We love Incognito and this CD delivers some great tunes!  From beginning to the end, the entire CD is enjoyable.
B0074MZSWW|2.0|The music of this group is fantastic!! BUT, the sound quality of the recording is TERRIBLE... very poor mixing and masterizing....
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game kept me so excited and had me feeling like I was really there. some parts were a bit frightening, but that made me like it even more! I think it is worth buying, and you certainly won't get bored!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hey I have a question. Does anyone know how to harvest the red.lava stone or something? If you know the answer, pleas PLEASE,PLEASE  ANSWER  if you can get s fish pole or a bucket on THIS EDITION AND NOT THE COMPUTER, then please ANSWER. BYE!
B004M5HUXE|5.0|excellent to read as an adult and realize the cultural statements of the era and, of course, the beautiful writing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have read. It was sweet. Heart warming, and emotional. I promise you will love it!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a fun little game and pretty engaging I've only played it for about a hour. I got the game for free but I did buy more credits.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't know wether to call this book 'Wool', 'Omnibus' or 'The Silo Saga', but don't let that stop you from reading them/it.<br /><br />I got this collection from my Amazon Recommended section and could not have ben happier with my random purchase.<br /><br />The story was properly dystopian and just post-apocalyptic enough to sate my appetite.<br />The characters, though some come and go too quick (only a testament to the good writing, as I really got into some, only to see them gone before I wanted) are engaging and relatable.<br />The world is well fleshed out and described well.<br />The pacing, for five books was great.  I think all together they comprise close to 1000 pages, but I read through them non-stop in about 2 days.<br />I really didn't want the stor to end and I wanted to know more and more.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this series, and this author.  I immediately started on Molly Fyde after this and was struck at the vastness between worlds created, but equally pleased with the writing style.
B001K98MFK|5.0|Ghost in the Shell is my anime obsession of choice. The steelbook edition of innocence is the easiest to obtain without &#34;necessarily&#34; spending over $100 (blu ray). Unlike the crappy and money obsessed dreamworks release it contains the famous english voice cast. There is nothing wrong with the japanese voice actors they are fantastic, but I was introduced to GITS by Richard Epcar, Crispin Glover, and Mary McGlynn. This edition from what I can see features the O.S.T. one of my favorites, and a higher quality digital transfer. Beautiful cover art. (STEELBOOK ROCKS!) and for any anime fan I consider this a requirement. Innocence is the grandest melancholly appraisal of human philosophy and a lovely sequal to the original film. pardon my grammar and thanks for choosing the steelbook edition of INNOCENCE. :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Moving on so many emotional levels. Fear, frustration, love,  pain, the list goes on. I couldn't put the book down for a minute.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|PBS has made an excellent series that gives us a glimpse of times long forgotten. I love the fact that there is a dual system of hierarchy with the owners of Downton as well as the staff. Looks great when streaming.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|I like this game which is why I'm giving it a high rating. I would have loved to keep playing but after level 6 the game just wouldn't load on my Kindle Fire Tablet. If you're not running a Kindle Fire then I recommend this game because it definitely is fun. Runaway Studios please make a version for Kindle users!
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|This is an awesome game, but as with most games and me, I have to find the most hidden in plain sight problem. With this game the only thing that's missing is sandbox mode. Being rank 40, I think that I would like the game better if sandbox mode was there. But enough on my childish wishes for sandbox mode.<br /><br />I love this game! I started playing it on the computer at my school on the last day of the first semester. When I got home at one point or another in the following weekend I searched for it in my kindle.<br /><br />I liked unlocking all the awesome towers, and I think I only have a few more to go. The graphics are awesome in this game, as compared with btd4 and under.<br /><br />This game brought back the joys of popping in btd3.<br /><br />Sometimes I wish that monkey money was easier to come by, but it's just the right amount of challenge.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Great eye-opening read! It makes me want to go on an adventure! It made me cry and it made me smile.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Fun game. lots of puzzles to solve. Good graphics and music. I have played G 5 games before and so far this doesn't disappoint.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is one of those games that is simple, basic and timeless. This version is just that. The top option simplifies it more. No dragging our double clicking. Just a simple real and the card or like moves to where you want. I would definitely recommend it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|So refreshing to have such a classic series to add to my collection. I have since added season three to this series and waiting for season four.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Thought this was a very well directed movie. Good acting, good action, good story line. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I saw this in the theater and have been dying to watch it again.  You can tell that the writer of the book was the director because it was super subtle about what it's like being a teenage and growing up and didn't feel heavy handed at all.  So worth it.
1452101248|5.0|For years we have used The Vegetarian Epicure by Anna Thomas as our main special occasion recipe source.<br />Plenty now takes pride of place in the kitchen, even for our day to day inspiration.<br />One day someone will make a film about a young foodie who works their way through this book, page by page.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|Everyone should watch this documentary.  It makes you think more about what you buy as well as what  you eat.  I definitely intend on making changes.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I just love all the variations and combinations available with this app. it is perfect for me every time. yay!
B004LWZW4M|4.0|Great re-make.  Effects were awesome and James Franco turns in a solid performance.  Great story, although it will never beat the original, it was a well done flick.
B004LROUW2|5.0|There are times in your life when a certain book may resonate more than normal and I think this is that type of book. The story is masterfully told and just the right length.  I hadn't ever read a book by Murakami but I loved this.
B0057RCFQS|4.0|I'm ocd about my movie collection so I had to have all three, but the 4 stars is for the first Jurassic Park and the first one only...
1616550414|5.0|Lots of great info and details which I had no idea about in the Zelda universe and the concepts are pretty interesting, very great for a collection piece and got mine in great condition, was very happy with the purchase.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I love this show!  The only thing I dislike is that I couldn't watch the 3preseason without purchasing each episode. I have a prime account and feel that I should be able to see ALL episodes that have been previously run at the tv.  Other than that I love this show and would recommend it to everyone!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book and really makes you think while you're reading.  Really enjoyed every minute of it and now can't wait to see the movie
0061537969|5.0|I kept wondering: How Much of the experiences - emotions has the author 'actually experienced'?<br />He sure finds compelling words/phrases to grab the readers.  Short, succinct chapters & paragraphs are effectivly used here.<br />This book / author deserves HIGH PRAISE, lots of awards.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has changed how I read the Bible. It works on the kindle fire hd . If you can figure out up  to get an offline version, the  rest is super easy. I love  how you can follow others and possibly change their view of the Bible. IT HAS HELPED ME START TO READ A DEVOTION BECAUSE OF THE  REMINDERS you can set. The fact that it works on the kindle fire hd is good because most reviews I read about apps won  tell you about the hd, only the fire. I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS APP !!!!!!!!!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I saw this game and was intrigued by the look of it but never tried it until it was the faotd. It is surprisingly fun,  addictive,  and intuitive. As a quilter,  I enjoy the look of the cubes very much,  tho now this us taking up my time. Thanks for a great game!
0061122416|5.0|A lot of pearls of wisdom in here. Inspire one to ponder their &#34;personal legacy&#34; and make the most out of the life we have.
B00026W82U|5.0|Kings of Convenience do something amazing on this record. They have managed to take a path that few others have done in the past few decades; stripping down to the barest elements, on some songs to as little as vocals and guitar. What you come away with is something beautiful and pure, renaissance in feel, a vibe that can transport you to another time or place.<br /><br />My only regret is that I did not discover this album until 2007. For the past 5+ years it has constantly stayed in my listening rotation, all 12 tracks. Every time I listen I am still awed by the magnificence of every nuance. I believe it will stand the test of time for as long as I, or anyone else shall live. This is truly one of the greatest albums of all time.<br /><br />PS - Feist is featured on this record as well, from back in her early days. She provides a sonically perfect compliment to the ethereal tones of Boe and Oye.
B007L96SI6|3.0|With her wonderful voice and energy, Haley has unbelievable potential.  However, whoever produced this album aimed it squarely at the wheelchair set with a fusion of lounge jazz and rap.  Wrong demographic for me to like this album.<br /><br />I hope she does another album that is current and energetic.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I just started watching the series this season and getting this set was a bonus.  Great show for those who have not gotten hooked yet.  The costumes and customs of the time, the drama of the Lords and servants makes for a wonderful night of entertainment. Enjoy!
B006WZIETG|4.0|Better than the first.  Would buy it again !  Such good  people and creatures, in this fun-packed movie.  Worth every cent.  ;))
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was an.upbeat and uplifting take on the life and death of a cancer patient. The how AND why of living with the knowledge that maybe this is your last week in the land of the living.  It would be an excellent read for high school age.
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|I installed this App and after trying to figure it out for about an hour I uninstalled it!<br />Impossible to understand and so I'm not wasting my time with it!
B0086700CM|1.0|the creepy monster gorillas keep killing me. I beloved that this is a very violent game that encourages thievery. also there is no fluffy pandas and unicorns. gtg. I need to stroke every bunny in the house.
B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|The book is definitely well written and good. However, whoever buys it should take into consideration that it is very upsetting. If you want to enjoy a book, this is not one for you. If you hope that despite the gruesome subject of the  book (cancer in children) it will not end too badly and the reader's tears are to be spared- think again. This is not meant as a critic against the writer. I'm just saying that this is not a book I would recommend to a good friend.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My favorite series on DVD, Yay!!!! I have all three series and they are wonderfully made. The series is a real classic!!!!

B0063GORYU|5.0|Five stars because this game has so many deals and its fast! It can be addictive, so watch out. but its fun to see how fast i can finish a puzzle!
B00BESM14U|5.0|I don't think I have ever read a book then seen the movie adaptation and liked it, but this was the exception. Excellent actors, and it is something to be said that the writer of the novel also wrote and directed the movie itself.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This game is addicting even though the story isn't . The story is just a means to get you from one puzzle to the next.  I like that the puzzles are not too hard, so if you are just looking to relax and have some fun with a puzzle or two or three then this will do it. I also like that each puzzle is different. Besides trying to find objects, there is also searching for the differences between a split screen, finding  10 to 20 of the same object & even  jigsaw puzzles. I'm only up to the 4th level, but I'm glad I downloaded it and I recommend it to anyone looking for a little challenge. If you're looking to strain your brain, you may want to pass.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun game to occupy time. It's an enjoyable game I would recommend. Haven't had any problems with the program. Game has never crashed out shut down.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This an entertaining movie. Good photography and plenty of noisy pyrotechnics and a splendid motorcycle chase but it's not as concise and enthralling as Matt Damon's three 'Bourne's'. For one thing the story line is a bit confusing. I've watched this movie three times and I still can't figure out what it's about. Something to do with green and blue pills but what these have to do with anything is a bit of a mystery to me. Our hero is first shown tackling the Alaskan wilderness as a sort of initiation exercise.In this he escapes death by evading a CIA drone which is out to get him. Why is not immediately apparent. How he survives this subzero, snowy jungle is not revealed to us; but he does, which adds to the mystery.<br /><br />Also,its one of those annoying productions in which the action parts are several decibels louder than the dialog bits which are spoken in a whisper. If you could make out what the characters were talking about maybe the plot would be clearer. It requires a skillful handling of the volume control at all times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|me and my mom love this game I play it every day when I get home. it is such a fun game even for the kindle fire.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|\\"This is a really strong Lego set castle that is as small as the Lego Space Needle. I love it.\\"
B004LROUW2|5.0|1Q84: Imaginative, compelling, sometimes surreal.  I didn't want it to end and highly recommend it to your readers.  I'll be looking for all his other books.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book on the recommendation of a friend.  She knows that I am the mom of a 14 year old girl who died from a rare type of bone cancer 5 years ago.  What I loved about this book was the honest emotions of the characters.  How they bond from living in the cancer world.  Some of my best friends are people who I met during our five years in the cancer universe.  This book deserves all the praise it has gotten.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am looking forward to the third book. I have enjoyed reading many of Ken Follet's novels. This series is my favorite. I feel as though I knew each character personally. I am already trying to decide what will become of each of them. Fantastic, fantastic read!
B00000612P|2.0|Low resolution CD when will the record companies record these CDs at the best resolution so simple. Some are good but not this one
0316069434|5.0|Boston Globe's reaction to &#34;The Black Box,&#34; from the book's cover: &#34;Connelly is an Undisputed Master.&#34; Indeed! All those reviewing before me have said it all--no reason to repeat them, but to every positive comment I say &#34;Aye, aye!&#34;<br /><br />It wasn't so much I couldn't put it down; I wouldn't. A pleasurable Saturday experience. Thank you Michael!
B003Y8YXFS|1.0|This CD is low resolution I have the original vinyl album and the sound is a thousand times better. Too bad the original is fantastic. John would be furious.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a fantastic book.  I couldn't put it down, Sparks is an amazing writer.  If you love his books, you'll love this one as well.  I loved the ending, it was totally unexpected.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Classic record i listen to over and over never gets old. Highest resolution recording makes all the difference. can't give any higher praise for artist and record company.
B007R41E8O|2.0|Way too much running back and forth. Ending doesn't tie in with the rest of the game. Most annoyingly, the game kept closing out and not saving my place,forcing me to redo tasks that had already been done.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly does it again.  The Black Box is another great Harry Bosch mystery.  It holds your attention, has twists and turns, then ends with a surprise result.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved all three books. These books with filled with passion, romance, mystery, action and a happy ending. What more can one ask for.

B0009QZ4CO|4.0|Near the top of the heap of Van Der Graaf albums, I wanted to post a brief reply to the glowing reviews of the remastering job on this and the other Virgin VdG CDs.<br /><br />Yeah, you can hear every last detail because the sound has been compressed and EQ'd to death. Still Life along with the others have been jacked up beyond reason and sound *blaring loud* now. If you play all your music through 2\\" computer speakers or earbuds this may work just fine; otherwise I'd advise against them. The Caroline originals are easy to find and sound considerably better. The new editions do have nicer booklets, for what that's worth.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I loved this book. It was exciting from beginning to end. I will defiantly order another of David Baldacci books.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was really really really good I liked it very much and want to tell people to read it puple
B00ARIO7PO|3.0|So Tubular Beats, what's it all about? With so many Tubular Bells albums out there a little clarifacation may be required.<br /><br />The tracks on this album are remixes of a range of old classics far broader in choice than the Tubular cannon. They are not the remasters or re-recordings we have become accustomed to expect from Oldfield and his peers. Mike has never been one for convention though and these re-mixes whilst being great club-dance-trance versions of old classics, feature new riffs and noodling from the guitar maestro.<br /><br />So what about the results? I think it is fair to say that Oldfield fans of old may find it difficult to warm to these tracks but I wouldn't be so hasty, just don't go in expecting a return to multi-layered hand-crafted mastery and you won't be disappointed. Much has been said about Oldfield's forray into club and electro territory and I for one have been known to heavily slate it in my reviews. This album though is vastly different to all that, this time round he gets it right. I always thought Oldfield was at his best when working with someone else, I'm thinking about Tom Newman on the early masterpieces, David Bedford on Incantations, Pierre Moerlern and Morris Pert on Five Miles Out, etc. Here he has Torsten Stenzel, otherwise known as York, to show him the way. Maybe Light and Shade and Tres Lunas wouldn't have been so awful with this chap on board!? Importantly though, this isn't an album that pretends to be trance and misses the mark, this is the real deal with all the right sounds and production, this is the first truly modern Oldfield album in a generation.<br /><br />I do though have reservations about the To France and Moonlight Shadow remixes They're just too cheesy for me, I can see them working really well on the radio though. I also find the new track; Never Too Far rather boring. It's far too familiar territory for Oldfield, very well produced but melodically could have been written any time in the last 20 years.York & Mike's Electrofunkmix of Guilty and Northstar though sound better than the originals to me so overall I'm happy.<br /><br />I'm not sure that Tubular Beats works as an album though. I've prefered to listen to one or two tracks at a time, maybe I'm getting too old for this sort of thing! I certainly couldn't dance all the way through, those days are well behind me. Not sure about the sleeve and title either, it's not a Tubular Bells album and I would liked to have seen some interesting new artwork to add to the Oldfield mythology.<br /><br />If you've come to Oldfield because you liked his Olympic appearance this album will not disappoint, buy it. If what you yearn for is a return to the Oldfield of Ommadawn and Hergest Ridge you'd be better off downloading Mohribold by Andrew Taylor. It's the only thing that's come close since Amarok. Google it, I downloaded it from a site called bandcamp. I've got a lot of mileage out of Mohribold and have raved on about it to every Oldfield and prog fan I can.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|not very thrilled about this movie. i will probably watch the next one just because. im curious how it ends.
1455502758|5.0|Hitchens will always be one who can spark a great debate. However, regardless of where one might stand on what his views are this book is life changing. As a Cancer survivor he put somethings into words that I never could, but more over the power and weight of his words left me speechless. I now own almost all of his books and am devouring each on.<br /><br />If you read only one book this year it should be this one and you will want to read it again and again.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This is a powerful movie about a man you to want to love's struggle with alcoholism, he just happened to be in a plane crash. This is not a courtroom drama, not an action flick (the plane crash happens in the first 30 min of the movie and lasts maybe 5-10 minutes tops, after that all drama.<br /><br />The movie starts out with an epic plane crash scene, one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. Denzel's character takes control of the plane like a pro, with every ounce of drug and alcohol seemingly vaporized from his system and his instincts as an ex-Navy fighter pilot take over.<br /><br />The movie is great in it has you rooting for this guy throughout, but he keeps letting you down as the viewer, as well as all of the characters in his life. You saw how awesome this guy was in the cockpit, he was a hero, yet he cannot overcome this addiction. How can a man who could do such extraordinary things be so vulnerable to addiction? The movie does this part very well.<br /><br />The most powerful scene emotionally comes at the end during the NTSB hearing and the scenes that follow.<br /><br />I will admit until I gauged what the film was really about I was kind of \\"meh\\" about it, but by the end I fully understood and appreciated it for what it was. Powerful movie indeed.

1117994112|4.0|Les Miserables by Victor Hugo French Edition Part 1 Fantime<br /><br />This is the first book of the famous work by Victor Hugo.  It opens with M. Charles-Francois-Bienvenue Myriel, Bishop of D., a town in the mountains of France.  The bishop (&eacute;veque) is a very kind man. He's moved to the town with his sister, Madame Magloire, and their maid, Mademoiselle Baptistine.<br /><br />He's in charge of a hospital, but his house is bigger than the hospital, so he trades his house with the hospital. He never closes his door, so that everyone has access to God's place.  At one point, the cathedral is robbed of all its treasure and he decides, against all opinions, to go to where the bandit Cravatte lives and has a \\"Te Deum\\" at the small parish where the thieves live.  The local priests argues that they're not worthy of having such a big ceremony by the bishop.  But M. Myriel tells them that God will provide.<br /><br />As the ceremony is going to start, M. Cravatte leaves a package with all the stolen treasures from the cathedral, and the Te Deum is held.  The bishop returns to his town having extended his influence in the country and with the stolen treasures.<br /><br />We are then introduced to Jean Valjean, whose life was a miserable existence.  He grew up very poor, his parents died when he was a young lad, and he's forced to provide for his sister and her seven children.  One terrible winter night, Jean Valjean steals from a store in town and he's sentenced to the galleries to do manual work.  He tries to escape and his five year sentence is extended to nineteen.<br /><br />Jean Valjean is finally set free, but he can't find work or shelter because of his passport - that tells everyone he's a dangerous criminal.  As he enters the town of D. he's refused shelter at the two local inns.  Finally, he ends up at Bishop Myriel's house where he's fed and sheltered.  As he spends his first night in nineteen years in a bed, he can't sleep and after fighting with his conscience, he decides to steal all the silver at the bishop's house.<br /><br />Valjean is caught by the local police, but upon returning to the bishop's place, the bishop tells the police that the silver was a gift.  M. Myriel tells Valjean that he's bought his soul for God.<br /><br />As Valjean leaves the bishop place, he steals from a child some 40 sous, and he then realizes that he needs to change - after all the bishop has bought his soul for God.<br /><br />The book ends with four students and their girlfriends:  Tholomyes -and Fantime, Listolier - and Dahlia, Fameuil - and Z&eacute;phine, and finally, Blachevelle and Favourite. After caroling, dancing, singing, dining and making love, the four students decide to give their girlfriends a \\"surprise.\\" It consists of a fabulous dinner at Bombarda, a restaurant at the Champs Ellys&eacute;es.  After finishing the diner, the boys give the girls a letter in which they say good-bye.<br /><br />All the girls, except Fantine, laugh it off.  But Fantine is very hurt:  both because she was truly in love, and because she's pregnant.<br /><br />Victor Hugo uses his work as a platform to give the reader a critique:  a critique of the times - Napoleon, the return of the royals (Louis XVIII), and a critique of the revolution and the poor state of the poor people.  This copy of the work is an abridged version in French and only covers the first book.  It was a pleasure to read in French....he decides to steal all the silver at the bishop's house.<br /><br />Valjean is caught by the local police, but upon returning to the bishop's place, the bishop tells the police that the silver was a gift.

1938469011|5.0|This is the book I was expecting from Mitch Steele's IPA publication. But thank goodness we've got Stan Hieronymus to save us! This is a fantastic book regarding the history of hops, how to use them, practical application, conversations with IPA brewmasters, and tips/techniques to use regardless of brewing skill level. I could type a longer review but in the end it would all read the same...&#34;if you're into hops, get this book&#34;.<br /><br />One nice feature is, if you look at the book on edge, there is a dark grey band indicating the location of hop varieties. This gets referenced quite often and it's a nice feature the publisher include in the printing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a good app that works well with the system and we have had  no problems with this app so far. Wife likes playing it often.
1938469003|3.0|I believe the title is a bit misleading. If you removed the &#34;Brewing Techniques, Recipes&#34; portion of the title or moved them to the end of the title and put them in a smaller font, you'd have a better idea of what the book presents. I purchased this book on pre-order as I was hoping to improve my knowledge of brewing with hops. After all, Mitch &#34;The Man&#34; Steele of Stone Brewing fame wrote this book!<br /><br />Instead, I received a very well written history of the IPA style with a few brewing tips and recipes thrown in towards the the end of the book. Some recipes are so vague as to make you scratch your head and not be of any use at all. To top it off, there are only 28 pages dedicated to hops (brewing/types/describing alpha acids/etc). You could learn more about hops from reading online or, now that it's out, pick up &#34;For the Love of Hops&#34; by Stan Hieronymus....one of the best books, if not the best, on hops at this time (late 2012/ early 2013).<br /><br />In the end, I do know more about the origins of IPA and a more overall view of how to replicate the style but this book is more for the person with 10+ years of brewing under their belt. In the end, I would give this book 5 stars for history and 2 stars for &#34;brewing techniques and recipes&#34;.

B0054YIQLW|5.0|One of my favorite Operas of all times!<br />Julia Migenes is the perfect Carmen! Placido Domingo is great here. I lost my copy and I have to say that this version is a must if you are a Bizet admirer! One of the best operas ever ! You must get this version! it is the best one! I could not see myself alive if I did not own one! I love it! It is my inspiration! Just Beautiful!

B006YTTVHO|3.0|The book downloaded fast and was an ok read though more of a presentation and very short. For free it was ok to get just out of interest though there are much better books out there.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is another great movie by the company that produced Fireproof. Although probably one of the lowest budgets movies we have seen, it is one that makes you think and ponder. It is a movie  you watch once but it stays with you as you ponder the message of it. This is a movie we will keep in our library and loan out to other families, especially husbands and fathers.

B006ASALY6|5.0|this is a beautiful example of a chic productions album , it has added the guitar of chris stein , so what? is as disco as the other chic albums & very well produced & played. after all harry, made some other disco songs , or not? what are heart of glass, the tide is high, call me, with their respective 12\\" dance versions & the shorter rapture? it all sounds disco to me. besides, the lyrics in this album are hilarious, is so funny. is a very very good album. i like it more now than when i first got it on plastic 32 yrs ago
B000OVLINI|5.0|Used it on Kindle and was a great book that takes a little to get into. Would reccoment it to book clubs.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|this is a fabulous movie, about the horror side of childrens fairy tales. i wouldnt recomend it for kids younger than 8 or 9 yrs old bcos sometimes it gets really suspenseful, kids get taken away by monsters & all this stuff that i dont think is suited for a child to see. but i loved it. matt damon is really normal in this movie, but the act of heath ledger is superb. how many more good movies could have he done?
B008KS4DR0|5.0|I decided to watch this movie on a whim and from the very start was happy with my decision. This was one of the best satires I have seen in that last 5, maybe 10 years. As I do not wish to reveal much i will say that this movie kept me engaged throughout, while providing plenty of very hearty laughs. This is definitely not a family film, but if you do not mind some blood then you will really enjoy this movie.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|im 50yrs old now & i had the same fun watching this movie than when i watched it like 5 times before i was 10yrs old. the only difference is that now i understand the plot, when i was a kid it was for me a festival of music & color
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Loved the first book but this one was just too unrealistic to believe all these families had someone who participated in every major event during this time period.  He is great story teller and makes it work so in the end it is still an enjoyable read. 900 plus pages is long, but he keeps the story moving and it does not feel like it takes you long to get through the chapters.
B003719G40|4.0|I learned so much about myself and my husband while reading this book.  I've tried to implement many of the guidelines and suggested ideas in my life and relationship with my husband. It's gonna take some time to turn the Titanic around.  My husband thought it was stupid and insulting.

B002ZG980U|5.0|One of Nolan's finest!  Great actors and an amazing original story, in fact, the best movie I've ever seen that wasn't based off of something.  If you haven't seen it, SEE IT!
B004SNC4NQ|5.0|Great shoe, very comfortable. Extremely lightweight,you actually forget you are wearing them. After three weeks it has become my go to shoes wherever I go.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|I just finished it, and there are still a few confusing points, but that is understandable seeing as I haven't read the book.  Very well made, but kind of fast paced, as each episode, with the exception of the finale, is only 30 minutes long.  Loved all the actors, and I could feel Dickens seeping through in the characters.  Very well done and I would watch it again in a heartbeat!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Another great book about a dog's perception.  This book is narrated by the dog and is about an owner who is a race car driver, must deal with his ill-dying wife, his daughter is taken away, and he is charged with a horrible sexual assault.  His struggle to better his life with balancing all this stuff, and see a dog's perception made it really work.  Dog is man's best friend and is another book about their relationship.  Read it, it has a great ending and will tie in beautifully with this review.  I left most of the good parts out.
B009LA1QW6|4.0|This album takes time to get used to.. It's not as impressive as her first album and falls short on number of tracks. But it has a few good gems that'll keep you coming back to it. I'm just hoping for a more robust album next time around and with a bit more upbeat songs.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Mystery, suspense, love, tears and just a wonderful story written perfectly! I would recommend this to everyone! Awesome book! Loved it!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I would have given it a higher rating if it hadn't been for the pointless nudity and the filthy dialogue that will make your ears bleed.<br /><br />Wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Good story line, but drags at times. Certainly not Mr. Washington's best work, not even close.
B0063IH60K|4.0|EASY,SIMPLE AND CLASSICALLY REMINISCENT OF THE ORIGINAL PCGAME WE ALL USED TO OVERCOME BOREDOM JUST A LITTLE. STILL WORKS THE SAME
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|After reading this book i realize that The 5 love languages apply to all relationships. This is great insight for any individuals.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|A must have for the Kindle, much easier to navigate than the default search function.<br />Hope that they never offer Bing
B000009RC2|5.0|I was given a Good product, good price, and on time, couldn't ask for better than that. I'm totally satisfied.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Just love these hidden object games from nevosoft. Fun mystery, good graphics, and some mini games thrown in. I got this when it was the free app of the day, but if I were to buy it today, I might be disappointed in the number and variety of mini games. Only 22 chapters means I finish pretty quickly! Would love to see a longer mystery with more interesting mini games.
B00571F26Y|5.0|As a physician I appreciated all of the research that went into this book.<br /><br />I have never been one for these kinds of diets/lifestyle modifications, but Dr. Davis does a convincing job of explaining why it may now be necessary.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Really good deal on this classic. I was at the concert in this movie and even think I saw myself in it! Hahaha!
B000000W8C|5.0|but what i don't get is the photo of a licence plate.  On it, there is a Cross & the words \\"music saves.\\"  Uummm, i don't think so!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun and entertaining, it is almost like having my own horse :) the graphics are great  :) I highly recommend this app
B005MQW5RI|4.0|Good story - different but entertaining - shows kids that a bad person can change if they want to.  3D effect is very good with the flying scenes
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is one of the best movies around.  I have seen it more than once and love it every  time.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Even tho each game takes a while. My first run took 9+ mins. It is a fun game. If you like mahjong you'll probably like this. Think mahjong in 3d. Enjoyable.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Another game that I cannot figure out, but the grandkids love this one too.  They have fun with it lots
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Allows you to create your own new age type music. It has many sounds that you can turn on or off to create the most pleasing music that you would like. Think, fully customizable new age music.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Not sure about this one yet.  The grandkids love it.  I am not sure if I could get into it yet
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Bought these for my son to bring with him places. He loves them even tho the supplied hook does work. He has decided that the holes are too much work. He'd much rather use a rubber band to keep them together. It should be made with a box instead.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really like this one. I play it with the cards, on the computer and now on the kindle.  One of the best games ever
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I already have a nook. I do not like paying for books. I found a website that finds free books for you. I found a book that I wanted but don't have a kindle. So I turned my 7 &#34; tablet into a kindle. Great! Now I don't have to bring both with me when I go somewhere. I just bring my tablet now!
B005HSL626|3.0|Again the grandkids love this game, but I am not really into this myself.  Only downloaded it for the kids
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great no thinking time waster. Sometimes you just want to do something but not want to tax your brain. This is that game. Its fun and anyone can play it. No smarts involved. Just finger agility.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a unique block matching game.  The premise, match all of the little cubes that make up the larger cube as fast as you can. You can rotate the cube in all directions,giving this game a unique 3d feel. Score is earned per match, with a higher value earned for quicker matches (through multipliers). There are two variants in this game... a typical match and a timed mode. The time mode starts with just a few blocks and more appear over time. Keep the block from completely filling by making quick matches.<br /><br />A fun game, it could use some polish. A save function would be nice, as the game is currently limited to times you can sit and play through a while block. Also, the leaderboard does not seem to work. Further improvements might include additional play modes?<br /><br />All in all, a good game, if kept in the  $1-2 range. Only time will tell if the developer keeps up development.
B008NW67E0|5.0|There's not one cut on this cd that I don't enjoy thoroughly. Loved hearing their music (before I even knew who they were) & was so happy to see their performance & success on the recent Grammies.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this movie. It's got suspense, action, and romance.  I like the way the made the children's fairy tale come alive.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Love this movie - it makes me laugh and cry; I love to share...<br />I received the movies in a timely matter...would use them again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love the game. This game is really addictive. I don't say it's better than the first. What is next?
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is one of those books that come around every blue moon, just like the Night Circus mentioned.  I'd just finished &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo&#34; series and really wanted something that could hold my attention.  This book did that from go.  I read it in a week and that's saying alot for me as I have a 5 year old and a full time job so everynight after I put the boy down I would open my book and escape.  Get this book if you want to be entertained and enter a world unlike your own.  It is awesome!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game because it feels like you're taking care of a real horse and its really fun! Can't stop paying it is very luring
B005KR6O58|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter and she loves it...it was a great addition to her movie collection...I even enjoy watching it with her...

B003ODIZL6|3.0|Good Thing just some minor changes and Improvements<br /><br />and increase the size of the letter so it can be readable
B0022CY8WK|5.0|My whole family loved the movie, so I had to get the sound track. There are 2 tracks that are a little weird, and that I don't remember from the movie, unless they were behind the credits.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I don't remember how I stumbled across this film, but the first time I watched it I was extremely impressed.  It is a beautiful, quiet, and subtle film exploring the subject of dealing with death, both within Japanese society, and for humans in general.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed writes with gut wrenching honesty about all the bad choices and sad events in her life that led her to taking on the PCT.  Survival on the trail seems to clarify who she is. The journey becomes the destination.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|Tom Cruise’s new film “Jack Reacher” is best appreciated when seen in parts. There are some well-executed action set-pieces including one Philadelphia car chase done in a restrained 70s style. It’s a crime thriller with twists and turns (and one-liners) aplenty, and it certainly keeps you guessing until the very end, but something is missing in this movie, something that would make the film really unique.<br /><br />The story of Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), a former military police officer (character created by author Lee Child) investigating a case of a seemingly random killing spree is so convoluted that it cannot be summarized in just a few sentences. Rosamund Pike is a defense attorney Helen whose father happens to be the DA (Richard Jenkins). And the ex-military sniper accused of murders is now in coma.<br /><br />All these things require a fair amount of suspension of disbelief, but still they are fine as long as you get a strong central character and some memorable supporting ones. I have not read the original and the fans of the books may disagree, but Tom Cruise did a good job as the (anti-)hero Jack Reacher, who claims he is not a hero. Not surprisingly, Cruise's “Days of Thunder” co-star Robert Duvall steals scenes effortlessly.<br /><br />The film benefits from the interesting main character and slick storytelling, but the script (by Christopher McQuarrie, Oscar winner for “The Usual Suspects,” who also directs “Jack Reacher”) does not give us a reason to care what happens next. It’s like watching the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, but the process is not very intriguing. As the story unfolds, we finally see the bigger picture, which is, honestly, just preposterous.<br /><br />As is often the case with such films, “Jack Reacher” manages to hold the viewer's interest not so much through the originality than the star power and effective set-pieces. It is watchable but forgettable.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I thought it was a really great book because it's storyline was very interesting and gave some great tips. I would recommend it to everyone because of what I said above!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a superb fantasy universe. The attention to detail makes everything come to life. It is quite a unique story.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this movie! I couldn't find my DVD, so I ordered it on Monday and was watching it Wednesday!<br />Very happy with my purchase!
1616550414|5.0|I anticipated this book after I learned of its Japanese publication, and I ordered it as soon as it was made available in the US. Well, I finally got my copy and it is actualy larger, heavier, and more impressive than I had hoped. It's definitely worth the price and all Zelda/Nintendo fans should order their own copy ASAP. If had to make a criticism it would be this: since Twilight Princess is my favorite game in the series, I would have preferred more of a focus on that game. Nevertheless, it is a great book.
630529142X|5.0|Have loved this movie since the first time that I watched it !! Great story !!! Adam Sandler is always great !!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really liked this book.  It normally is not my cup of tea. I was good I just wished thenendingnwas a little longer. You can make up your own mind about it but I just wish they would have you know what happened after everything.
B002VECM72|5.0|I bought this movie because my son and fiance love this movie!! They are very happy with this BluRay so thank you
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this book. I worried in the beginning that Holder was too moody and volatile. And it was going to be one of those stories where he would be violent with everyone but her and she was going to love him without understanding that eventually the violence was going to affect her. But he isn't. It's a good read.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|This book was like nothing I've ever read before.<br /><br />It is about such a dark part of society yet it has such an innocent tone.<br /><br />The book written in the view of Jack, a five year old boy, who's mum was kidnapped when she was 19.They live in room. Room is just a room but to Jack it is literally his whole world; because Jack doesn't know of anything outside of Room, to Jack room is the world.Yet he couldn't be any happier.<br />So what happens when you finally learn there is something else outside of everything you've ever known? Would you want to leave?<br /><br />This book is probably one of the most thought provoking and moving books I've ever read. Because it is told in the perspective of Jack, a child, it has such an innocent tone, yet the content is so heavy. I've never really read a book with this perspective before and I found it so interesting.<br /><br />It's like re-discovering the world again through the eyes of a child, a world that is both beautiful and tainted.<br />I think everyone should read this book when they have the opportunity, it shows our world through the eyes of someone who is just discovering it, yet has the ability to understand what is happening and feel emotion towards it.<br /><br />You will learn so much.It makes you appreciate what you have and realise what a throw-away society we really are. It made me cry sometimes but smile at others and I will never regret picking up this book.<br />It is truly a beautiful piece of work.<br /><br />I think anyone from the age of 14 should have enough knowledge and understanding to be able to read this book and understand the content matter.Give it a go and I'm sure you'll love it.<br /><br /> \\"In Room me and Ma had time for everything. I guess the time gets spread very thin like butter all over the world, the roads and houses and playgrounds and stores, so there's only a little smear of time on each place, then everyone has to hurry on to the next bit....\\"
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Game was fair not enough puzzles or brain teasers if all you want is hide and go seek pretty God I personally like a little more challenge
B00881VLCE|3.0|Terrible selection of puzzles in the free version. I don't want to have to pay money to get puzzles that aren't creepy female models, cats, or babies. Otherwise...it's a pretty fun app.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its a gteat game for everyone!  I highly reccomend it.  it reminds me of the circus but without spending a bunch of money
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have a kindle and every time I play I bring my charger because it's sooooo addicting game get it
1594135851|4.0|Catching Fire was a great book! Albeit, not as good as The Hunger Games. But really, which sequel to any book is as good as its predecessor? In any case, Catching Fire did suffer from the Middle Book Doldrums, but if you really want a grasp on the story, I suggest that you read it. :)
B005I6EU48|4.0|I have found the Verso Case Cover for Kindle Fire to be strong, solid and more then capable to live up to expectations.  Now not only is my Kindle protected but it is done in an fashionable manner.
159413586X|4.0|Not as good as The Hunger Games, but better that Catching Fire, Mockingjay brings back some action and focuses on the rebellion that Katniss and Peeta inadvertently began with the berries. Overall, it was a good book. It ties up all the loose ends, and we find out if Katniss ends up with Peeta or Gale. At the end of the book, Katniss didn't pick who I liked more, so I'm kind of biased in that area. I see WHY she chose who she did, I'm just not happy with it. I could go on, but back to my review. Read it, for the sake of finishing the series, and so that you can find out who Katniss chooses!!! Have fun!
1250006341|5.0|My wife has not stop raving about how wonderful this book is. We saw it on vacation in England last year so I surprised her with it for Xmas.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a huge fan of post apocalyptic science fiction. My favourites include I am Legend, Earth Abides and The Road, among others.<br /><br />What I find other post apocalyptic fiction lacking in is reasons for why the new governments or states do the things they do (if there are new governments even depicted) and how people react to them. Most books tend to focus down on the micro details of people's lives and the hardships they face. This book is really amazing because it does both.<br /><br />It shows us how society evolves within a massive bunker designed to protect the survivors of a nuclear war and how the balance of power plays out within it. It also connects the readers with the smaller details of the lives of the individual characters and does so really well.<br /><br />I read the first Wool installment for free. By the last page I couldn't wait to read the next one. I didn't hesitate, I bought the omnibus and enjoyed every minute of it. If I had to make a complaint it would be that it should have been even longer and maybe a little more complex.<br /><br />I think this book would be enjoyed even by people who aren't fans of science fiction and if you are one, don't wait, buy this book and read it. I'm off to buy the sequel!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Fast paced that keeps you turning page after page. Lots of twists and surprises. Far surpassed the first book, which I also loved.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Skyfall is an interesting Bond film instead of relying on gadgets/cars/women/exotic locations (which it does have for part of the film) it is more of a drama/action film that happens to star James Bond and that's what I liked about Skyfall. I won't delve too much into the film because I don't want this to turn into a review of Skyfall because this is a Blu Ray review and let me tell you this is a beautiful set the special features are interesting for the most part but what really stands out is how incredible this looks in HD. The scenery  is a sight to behold this might be the best looking film I own, and the work that cinematographer Roger Deacons did is breathtaking. The sound/picture quality is great very crisp if your a fan of the Bond series and this film it's must buy.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I rated this product 4 stars for a reason.<br />Here are the 3 reasons why.<br />1. Sound boost and Quality<br />2. My headphones<br />3. Recommendations<br />Back to reason one<br />The sound and boost quality on this thing is amazing for such a little device! When I got it in the mail i expected it to be slightly bigger. I was really surprised!<br />Now I own a Pair of V-Modas for when im mixing and producing my music. And I own a pair of Sol Republics for when im out listening to music in my free time.<br />Tip: Beats by Dre. Suck. All respect to Dr. Dre the rapper but the headphones suck. They are more useful as a paperweight than actually listening to (for Mixing and Just Listening to music.)<br />Anyways, back to my review.<br />I own a Pair of V-Modas and Sol Republic HD's. I tried out the Fiio E6 on my V-Modas. I heard no difference in the mids or lows or highs. But the Volume was impressive!<br />I tried it on my Sol Republic and it gave it a bigger bass punch lines which I loved! It made the Lows sound like you were into the music.<br />But it made a bigger difference on anything smaller like some apple earbuds. And on my old pair of Skull Candy Titans in ear.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this product to people who want better quality music with any earphones like Skull Candy, Apple, and Sony or JVC!
B005LAII8K|5.0|It's hard to find a good original film nowadays when we live in a world consumed by remakes and sequels/prequels (Which I don't mind most of the time). This is a great science fiction film that at first I was wary of because the marketing they do with films these days are sometimes not that great. I was dead wrong I thought this was incredible the acting the story the set pieces  the camera work it was all really really good. This is the best performance from Bruce Willis that i've seen since unbreakable and that was 12 years ago. Anyways the Blu Ray is really good the sound and the picture quality are great in a film that has some very bleak looking scenes because it takes place a future that is very bleak and not to over the top the city is futuristic  but still somewhat grounded in reality and outside the city it looks like our world today for the most part anyways. And the special feature are very interesting. It is a great film and a must have if you like science fiction time travel films.
B0029ZA49Q|5.0|nice companion when I go out to climb!! It fit my lowe 45 toploader perfectly. A good investment on your photography career.
B000HF0ILY|5.0|Now this is one of my favorite movies, along with High Planes Drifter.<br />After a corporate mining boss begins a campaign of terror to drive independant panning miners<br />out of the area and take over thier claims.

B00846REIS|4.0|I thought the book was very very good. It kept my attention and left me wanting more! I read Fifty first and I'm not sure which one came out first but details in the stories were strangely similar. Overall, awesome read.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|This sequel was so amazingly done! It made me smile, cry, and laugh. I don't think I've ever felt so much for fictional characters before reading this book. A MUST READ!
0316226424|4.0|\\"Breaking Dawn\\" is the last book in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series, and I must say I was kind of sad to come to the last pages, dreading saying goodbye to these characters.  At the same time, this novel was one hell of an adventure.<br /><br />Bella and Edward finally get married, ready to start their lives together, planning for him to turn her into a vampire with his love bite after their honeymoon.  Trouble is, the unthinkable happens when Bella gets pregnant!  Not only is her existence in danger as her health declines, the Volturi could pose a threat to what they may think of as an immortal child if it survives delivery.<br /><br />I loved how this book played out.  You'd think it would take a while to read those 700+ pages, but I flew through them in a few days, lost in the story.  There were parts of the second section that tied up loose ends like it was on a mission, but other than that, I think the ending was perfect.<br /><br />I know this is supposed to be the last book, but I'm hoping maybe the author will be overcome with desire to see what happens next one day.  Hint, hint, Mrs. Meyer!  :)
0345803507|5.0|Great reading.  Fun.  Third in the series. Have not finished ready this yet, but read some each day.  Will buy the next one!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I contemplated between 5 and 4 stars, and in the end I wanted to give Flight 4 1/2 stars but that wasn’t an option, thus I rounded to 5 stars. This is not the &#34;best&#34; movie I have ever seen but it is one of the best I have seen in a while. My short synopsis is Flight is a movie that takes on addiction honestly and frankly. It keeps your interest the whole time, sometimes you hate Denzel’s character Whip, sometimes you like him, and often I pitied him. To sum it up, I think my boyfriend said it best, &#34;It’s the little things&#34; in this movie that make it good, the little details Robert Zemeckis puts throughout the movie that really set it apart. Scene after scene there is detail, and the movie is filled with deep implications that are thoroughly thought provoking.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game it is better than the first temple it has more places to go n u have levels to pass n it's harder which makes it better n more changing
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Found this on a Friday at home and can't believe this movie isn't more popular.<br /><br />It's masterfully written and has a moral message that is subtle, completely lacking the condescending club of a script that movies like &#34;Avatar&#34; regularly hit us over the head with.<br /><br />I've rented some clunkers in my time and this ISN'T one of them. There is some gore, but it's mostly subdued and implied aside from a few key scenes. Considering the astonishing nature of the protagonist's opponent, it's amazing that the movie's violent scenes stayed reasonable. There is suspense here and an emotional roller coaster ride that continues to build and build, keeping you wondering how this will end.<br /><br />A hideous monster that hides in the shadows/dark and uses tricks of light to hypnotize its prey.<br /><br />A fine villain (who turns out not to be all villain) to watch with a bowl of popcorn.

B006RXPTNM|1.0|...what a boring disappointment this turned out to be. Im glad I didnt see it at the movies but got it out on DVD making it easy to do the dishes while the thin narrative plodded along.<br /><br />What was the point of this movie? To make the audience sympathise with the good intentions of the priest (PSH) who took a caring role of an underprivileged young black teenager and to turn against his accuser? And therefore the logical extension of this is that a lot of the allegations of sexual abuse within the Catholic church are factitious or exaggerated claims? That is, to instil doubt in US about institutional sexual abuse? If so then the movie is a disgrace.<br /><br />Even if this is not the message I doubt that there are any other redeeming features to it.
B004HMTKFI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  The writing is exceptionally fine and the story is very interesting.  If you would like to know more about Africa - customs and places, this is an excellent read.

B00A80SHFM|5.0|Being a big Hugh Jackman fan,  think the movie is the best this year and wish it could win all the Oscars and other awards, though Hugh did get a Golden Globe and some nominations.  I believe he is the most talented actor, singer, dancer, family man, etc.  but this movie -- Les Mis -- is such a great masterpiece of a movie and music from the stage show that I wanted to kill all the idiot critics who did not like it..

B007VUCAVO|5.0|App is great for the Kindle Fire Hd, provides much more data than native battery app, shows exactly how much power you have left for most process including surf time on wifi or cell network, video and music playback and more.  Solid app well worth the price for pro version.

No matter how bad the quality of this picture is, something is better than nothing, right?<br /><br />Aside from over-the-top humor (which only comes and goes, sadly enough) and the best Die Hard soundtrack to surface (with the music of both Frank Sinatra and The Rolling Stones!), A Good Day to Die Hard is far from, well, \\"a good day to die hard.\\"<br /><br />Instead, what you have here is a very bad day to die hard........John McClane Sr. may be a legend, but his father Bruce Willis has simply lost his freakin' mind!<br /><br />What I mean by that, I will discuss later in this review. Until then.....here's the basic information for ya.....<br /><br />A Good Day to Die Hard picks right up where Live Free or Die Hard left off: John McClane Sr. is still with the NYPD, still has a positive and restored relationship with his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and (as dialogue reveals) personally struggles in the era of Barack Hussein Obama II (his job in the NYPD being mediocre).<br /><br />Coincidentally, the wayward son of A Good Day to Die Hard, meanwhile, has gotten himself in too deep with a Russian political terrorist, Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch). He (the character of Jack McClane) is about to face trial and is wanted dead by Russian terrorists for his involvement with Komarov.<br /><br />And I think we'd all agree that Jack becomes a blessed man when his father flies all the way from New York City to Russia to rescue him (forget their problems; John Sr. loves his son and is going to risk his life for him). Well, sadly enough for John, he is risking his life for a brat (every bit of sympathy I felt for Jack going into the picture completely disappeared when he first came onscreen.) Forget the solid, Golden Globe and Academy Award-drama that carried the first four films so mightily. The drama we get here is mostly comprised of \\"the F-bomb.\\" There is no equal sympathy or empathy for the characters this time: they are just obnoxious and lack the artistry that Bruce Willis shared with both Bonnie Bedelia and Samuel L. Jackson in the earlier films.<br /><br />The action, meanwhile, is an impeccable joke: completely unrealistic. Videogame-ish. Sure, I know that in film, there are times when you substitute entertainment for reality and reality for entertainment (I'll give both Willis and Courtney the benefit of the doubt here, as their onscreen relationship mirrors what a real John-Jack McClane relationship would be like). However, with the action, entertainment overshadows reality. With the drama, reality overshadows entertainment. I think we'd all get annoyed by the \\"drama\\" (okay; Jerry Springer drama), but the action is so unrealistic that a five-year-old could catch onto it.<br /><br />As for what I meant about Bruce Willis \\"losing his freakin' mind,\\" a few years ago, he gave an interview about the current Die Hard film (when he knew that it was going to be produced). He said in this interview that he wanted to \\"take the p*** out of it (DH).\\" That explains the absence of the legendary action and drama that held the original four films...<br /><br />Next, WTH? was Willis thinking in picking John Moore to succeed Len Wiseman as director?!??!? The guy's only respected film is Behind Enemy Lines!!!!! Doesn't Moore's several flops as a director wave a red flag to picking Moore as the new DH director!??!?!??<br /><br />Sadly, it didn't, and hopefully Willis learned his lesson from the negative reactions to A Good Day to Die Hard.<br /><br />Three starts ****only***** for the comedy and soundtrack.so mightily.

0307341577|3.0|Not a bad book, but Sharpe Objects and Gone Girl are much better.<br />It is worth reading, but it does not have the same impact as Ms Flynn's other books.
B00B2LPYNE|4.0|Good band, not much has changed. That is not necessarily a bad thing though, still hardcore as ever. I would recommend if you have liked this band before.
0316228532|5.0|Wow.  In the beginning, a little wordy and hard to follow who is who.<br />Stick with it through the first couple of chapters, well worth it.<br />I missed the characters when I was done.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I give Mockingjay 4 stars for is combination of love and war. would recommend this book to any one who doesn't get scared of death in many different ways.
B005KELW26|3.0|Like. the color,texture but it would be nice for it to have a few other features, like a stylist holder and a way to prop up the kindle.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|Everything and more this album is the best. There is not one song I don't  like very welk made and just great.
B004BSFC6Y|3.0|These footie finders are real cute.  My daughter seems to like them.  The only issue I have is that they do not rattle enough.
0765325950|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. in fact, I think the only time I stopped reading was when my eyes closed.  fitting end to a series that spanned 15 years of my life.  well written and action packed.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|The detail is amazing and my son's spends hours pretending with this Town Hall - he loves Lego City and this is just a great addition.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Mind you, I've never read the Lord Of the Rings series nor the Hobbit. All I can say is that I've had the opportunity to watch the Lord Of the Rings Series quite a few times and have thoroughly enjoyed each viewing having leaned something new each time. I will say The Hobbit fells a lot less serious and a lot more fun. The Dwarves tearing up the Hobbit house was a lot of fun, makes you want to be there celebrating in the festivities. My wife and I saw it in the funky 3D which we very much enjoyed despite it taking a little getting used to. Being a Blu-Ray enthusiast I am eagerly awaiting the Blu-Ray 3D version. If you like the LORD of THE RINGS, you will love the Hobbit. March 5th can't get here soon enough.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Just as I was getting very mad the green had a date with justices. Now where are my dragons?  And the dwarf?
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Enjoyed the book and recommended to a couple friends. It was a quick and easy read. Kept my interest throughout.
0062101897|5.0|For both Harry Potter and movie fans, this huge book is perfect. It is broken down into 3 parts: each individual movie, the characters and the settings. The copious photographs are well-done and the information is clear and revealing.
B007G51UV0|4.0|The biggest issue with this board is that the Ethernet does not work correctly look it up and you will see what I'm talking about. I also get static through my usb 3.0 ports on  my gamecom 780's but not on any of the usb 2.0. I realize no board is perfect though and this board overclocks very nice and the bios is super easy to use and laid out very nicely. For the price this is a very nice board and you will be hard pressed to find a better at around the same price. One issue is that I broke my WiFi antenna and I can not find a replacment on either amazon or on Asus.com. All in all though I would recommend this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well written, and a great story! Keeps your attention. I think Colleen Hoover is a great author Highly recommended, along with a good price!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I downloaded this game for my Samsung Galaxy. I've never played Mysteryville before. It has great graphics and I really liked the plot. I've played a couple of hidden object games before but this one is the best one I've tried so far. I will keep an eye out for any other games made Nevosoft.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Gave it 5 stars because it is very well written, and quite a story.  Keeps your attention, and John Green is a very good author!
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|Author Roy Huff has created a fantasy with a lot of interesting stuff. Aimed at a young adult audience, nevertheless I enjoyed it at my advanced age of (mumble, mumble). I should think most anyone could enjoy the book. One thing I especially liked was the compact story. To many fantasies run on and on until I get bored. Not so  here.<br /><br />College freshman Owen Sage keeps finding himself transported into an alternate universe called Everville and in the presence of a bearded, robed fellow called the Keeper, telling him he needs help in repairing the breach to The Other In Between. At first thinking he might be hallucinating, he gradually comes to understand the part he has to play in saving this universe and, by extension, his own. He's aided by long time friends Anika and Dante.<br /><br />Author Huff needs in the next book to give us a bit more of Them, an evil presence that remains off-stage in this first book. I'm sure that's planned, but it would have enhanced my feelings for this one more to be let in on a few tidbits.<br /><br />It's worth a look and will certainly make me check out future books in this series. Seven books I would imagine since seven pillars are mentioned.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Love this app. Actually using the internet to learn something. Watch a lecture every morning during breakfast. I wish I had this as a kid.
0694003611|5.0|The book is for my great-great nephew and one I had growing up. It arrived quickly and in the best of condition.<br />Very satisfied with the service and the product.
B005HSL626|3.0|I do have to say that this is a fun game, however, when you play the arcade mode, they shoot out lots of bombs which make you lose 10 points. And as you are sliding your &quot;blade&quot; across the screen, you suddenly see a bright light on it, lose points, and lose time also because the clock ticking away the allotted time to play. I get them a lot, so I only get about 25-30 seconds of play time out of a 60 seconds game. It is free, so if you want it, get it, just don't be surprised to be annoyed or aggravated when you play this game. P.S. don't buy the priced version, there is stupid rewards that force you to have to go on-line to play any part of the game, plus this same bomb issue.
B006LSZECO|3.0|What a pathetic ending.  I was on pins and needles the whole entire time I was reading, and towards the end I am getting anxious wondering how it was going to end, and then it just ended. It was over.  Right to the acknowledgements.  I started thinking it was Amy's acknowledgments for her book, but it wasn't.  It was the end of the book.  I am sitting here thinking there has to be more. There HAS to be more to this story.  I get that Nick was screwed, but come on.  Very disappointed.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Bought as a gift. But was told it was great. Well i cant submit without 10 more words so hear thy are. HA HA..
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I was not expecting much when I saw this film and was very pleasantly surprised.  I enjoyed that there was a story, that the film was consistently entertaining and funny, and that the main characters were interesting and likable.  Though I never watched the TV show and had to have many of the references to it explained to me, I still enjoyed the film without knowing them.  The addition of Johnny Depp as a character was quite terrific.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This show is great. Keeps you on the edge of hour seat brest acting all around. No bad ones so far keeps. You guessing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest apps I've ever gotten and you will love it if you like temple run you will love this ten times more.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well first of all I like this game because I got my uncle playing it so he thinks he cab beat me well it might be true :0
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There's not much I can say about this book. It says everything necessary in it's beautifully arranged words. While I cannot say much about such a remarkable piece of literature, I can say this:<br /><br />The essence of humanity has been captured by the art of John Green. I will carry this story's lesson with me always.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I love this app. I can customize my own calendar. Add reminders for important events. And also create my own themes. One of the best calendar apps.
B007PAAO0Y|5.0|I love blues......Bobby Wormack CD is the greatest . I want to buy more blues . I also like Johnny Taylor and Ronnie Lovejoy
0452298482|4.0|the pages are cheap looking like someone hand tore them and put the book together. the pages seemed to be firm and in tact. as for the contents i can't comment as it was bought by me as a gift for a friend.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|What you take away from Zero Dark Thirty depends on what you bring into it. If you believe the actions taken leading to the death of Osama Bin Laden were justified, or even heroic, this movie will confirm those beliefs. If you are a skeptic this movie shows you why you were right to be skeptical. Zero Dark Thirty draws no conclusions about its subject. It's not a message movie. It doesn't have a moral. It's a MIRROR movie; when you watch ZDT you see your own opinions, clarified and reflected back at you.<br /><br />In many ways ZDT has more value as a conversation starter than it does as a movie. I'm not saying that it's not a great movie - it unquestionably is - but you'll get more out of it if you watch it, discuss it with other people, then try to re-watch it from another perspective and then discuss it again. Rinse and repeat. I've already seen the movie twice in theatres and will be watching it several more times on DVD.<br /><br />And whatever your politics, whichever way you chose to interpret the movie, ZDT is an outstanding suspense thriller.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain plays Maya, a young CIA analyst. Her job is to interpret information regarding Osama Bin Laden. While stationed in Pakistan she hears of Abu Ahmed, Bin Laden's courier. The name is an alias and little is known about the person behind it. Maya is convinced that finding Ahmed is the key to finding the so called \\"most wanted man in the world\\". Years pass and Maya doggedly pursues her lead eventually tracing him to the now famous Abbottabad compound.<br /><br />Chastain's performance is tremendous. It would have been all too easy for the Maya character to be a non-entity. All she ever does is her job. All she ever talks about is her job. She has no interests outside doing her job. What it is that motivates her to do her job is never explained. Yet Chastain acts her heart out and creates a fascinating portrait of someone who is driven to an almost unhealthy degree, an admirable and at the same time tragic figure.<br /><br />The supporting cast play their parts well, particularly Jason Clarke as a charismatic interrogator. And while clocking in at two and a half hours, Zero Dark Thirty is a long film I wish it had been longer so I could have seen more of them. But Mark Boal's screenplay is ruthlessly efficient; once a character has finished their role in the search for Osama their role in the movie is over.<br /><br />ZDT ends with a recreation of the raid on Bin Laden's compound. It's an unbearably tense sequence and just as exciting are all the scenes of characters attending meetings, sitting at computers and analyzing data and drawing conclusions that precede it. These scenes aren't thrilling because of the direction, which is understated, matter of fact and detached. Alexandre Desplat's score is mostly mood music - mostly vaguely ominous. It sets the scene but lets the characters and the action speak for themselves. And that's why the movie works; Director Kathryn Bigelow rightly assumes the events the film covers and the professionals involved, whether they are Seals or Spooks, doing what they do best are inherently compelling. She trusts her material enough to step back and allow it to stand on its own. Would the material be just as compelling if it were delivered with a bit more panache? Probably, but it could easily feel less authentic. Could it be MORE compelling? I don't think so.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Watch this film.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This film holds your interest long after the plane crash.  That's the very part of the story that keeps you interested and<br />Denzel Washington was, by far, the best pick for the lead role.  He did a wonderful job.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|There are very few movies that I consider anywhere close to as good as the book they are based on. This one is. The casting and the screenplay are very well done. It's a great story and a great movie.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Harold Fry has recently retired after working as a salesman for a local brewery for many years. He was competent but quiet, nondescript and largely anonymous to his co-workers. He lives with his wife Maureen in a modest home in Kingsbridge, a small village in South West England. Their marriage has been strained for years, as Maureen harbors bitterness and a deep seated hostility toward Harold, although she does not openly express a desire to leave him.<br /><br />On one ordinary day Harold receives a letter from his former colleague Queenie Hennessy, who resides in a hospice in Berwick-upon-Tweed, the northernmost town in England. She informs him that she has end-stage cancer, and writes to say goodbye to him. Harold is deeply affected by this news, and he immediately writes a letter of sympathy to her. He leaves home to mail the letter, and in doing so he encounters a teenage girl who works at a garage. After Harold informs her of the purpose of his trip, she tells him about her aunt's case of cancer. He is led to believe that the girl's belief led her aunt to overcome her terminal illness. He is greatly inspired by this, and he spontaneously decides to walk from Kingsbridge to Berwick-upon-Tweed, a journey of over 500 miles, in the hope that doing so will cure Queenie.<br /><br />As Harold walks, wearing only the street clothes, rain jacket and yachting shoes that he wore when he initially left the house, he reflects on his past mistakes in his relationship with his wife, their son David, and Queenie, who was fired from her job at the brewery in an incident that also involved him. He soon realizes that he has been an indifferent and reserved husband and father, unknowable to them, or to himself:<br /><br />&#34;It occurred to him it was Maureen who spoke to David and told him their news. It was Maureen who had always written Harold's name (&#34;Dad&#34;) in the letters and cards. It was even Maureen who had found the nursing home for his father. And it raised the question—as he pushed the button at the pelican crossing—that if she was, in effect, Harold, “then who am I?”&#34;<br /><br />He encounters a variety of people on his journey, most of whom support and encourage him once he tells them his story, and they eagerly share their experiences with him. Maureen is initially furious at him after she learns about his decision, but later her feelings transform to jealousy, despair, concern, and longing for him.<br /><br />As the journey becomes more arduous and the constant walking takes a toll on his mid-sixties body, his spirit begins to flag, and he wonders if he should have undertaken this foolhardy journey.<br /><br />&#34;The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry&#34; is meant to be an inspiring story of secular faith, self-discovery and love. However, I found it to be a banal and saccharine novel, which was largely pleasant but not one which was affecting or filled with wisdom, although the ending was easily the best part of the book. It, like Harold before his journey, was largely forgettable and mildly annoying in spots, and although it wasn't a bad book, it was the least favorite of the 2012 Booker Prize longlisted books I've read so far.question—as he pushed the button at the pelican crossing—that if she was, in effect, Harold, “then who am I?”&#34;<br /><br />He encounters a variety of people on his journey, most of whom support and encourage him once he tells them his story, and they eagerly share their experiences with him.

1609611543|5.0|Started eliminating the wheat while on a cruise.  Feel better, already lost four belly lbs and highly recommend this program.  Plenty of none wheat food:  Ezekiel bread, cereal, crackers, cookies, pancakes, etc.  The local grocer has whole shelves of wheat & gluten free products.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I love face book but i have hard time with application on my kindle, it download very slowly or does not update with my notifications, it stinks and I have great WIFI connection
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Almost always, filmed stage shows fall flat. This is a rare exception.  Phantom of the Opera at Royal Albert Hall is a lavish production of this amazing show, which takes the filming of a stage show to artistic heights.  It's as if every shot and camera angle was choreographed (no cut shots to the faces of audience members, thank god) .  Everything works.  The cast. The music (and audio quality).  The energy. The full orchestra.  It is a pure joy. If you are a fan if the show, this is a must have.<br /><br />As aside - the 2004 movie of this show was a disaster, since it was cast with an untalented Phantom who couldn't sing.  Any fan if this show will be glad to make that DVD into a drink coaster, and have this fabulous version take its place.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use this application on my kindle everyday and would probably go cray if it was avialable. I love it
B002SAUCBC|2.0|Was a bit of a disturbing book that isn't for everyone.  He left alot of things unexplained, which was annoying.  The ending sucked, in my opinion. Far from one of his best novels.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|this moview was not as cute or as funny as I thought it would be, instead it tuned out to be perverted, not for teens or kids
B00AREIAI8|5.0|some times it would not load other wise it's great!<br />very fun for little kids I think so but what am I to say I am a big baby<br />it also is great for people who like horses
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love this show Downton Abbey. I kept hearing all the hype about this show, so one weekend I decided to rent season 1 & check it out. I now understand what all the hype is all about. I will say this is one of the best shows that I have seen. I am glad that I re-watched season 1, because the rented version had cut scenes. Reading reviews, the U.S. version has cut scenes, so I would recommend getting the UK Blueray version,plus are unable to play the UK DVD disc in our DVD players, so be sure to order the BlueRay version. This season 3 disc also contains the Christmas special. Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|while I love this game for some reason it keeps resetting  and loses all my coins and characters I had open it has done this several times and I had over 100 hundred coins lost can't why this keeps happening so I just deleted the game
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I have been hearing so much about this show Downton Abbey, so I rented Season 1 to check it out. I am hooked, now I understand what everyone is talking about. This show & the characters are fantastic, it leaves you wanting more, which made me make this purchase of Season 1 & Season 2.  I am glad that I re-watched Season 1, because the rental that I had watched, had many scenes cut out of it. After reading some previous reviews, the U.S. version has some cut scenes, so I would highly recommend purchasing the BlueRay UK version. You can't play the UK DVD in our U.S. DVD players. This is a awesome show. This Blueray arrived quickly & in the new condition as stated. I just ordered Season 3 a few days ago, & it also has arrived. You will not be disappointed in this show. Enjoy
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I have been waiting for this for years, great price and it arrived before time estimated.  I will do business with again.

B00867GHS8|5.0|I was so happy it came out in 3D, I watched it as soon as I got it. It came in before time, I love it.
B00AR5BR8C|1.0|Not a family movie. I turned it off due to inuendo, bad language, & the most stupid plot that anyone has ever dreamed up. Good grief. I am sorry I rented it & wish I had the time back that I wasted watching even a few minutes of it!
B00B0NEH8C|5.0|By any band. When was the last time time you heard a riff heavy hard rocking song with a chorus that stuck in your head like glue?<br />I don't remember either!<br />The latest offering from Clutch is just that though.

0345479092|1.0|I love this book and Tracy's style, this is by far the best book out there for a new mom... which is why I wanted to purchase it as a gift for my newly pregnant friend... it's a rip off! fake! it's like they made copies of the original book and put it together themselves, pages were uneven and the book is half the size of the original book you would actually purchase from a book store! DO NOT BY THIS BOOK FROM THIS COMPANY! FInd the real deal.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|The perfect ending to a fantastic series!! The entire book keeps you guessing! Just when you think you've got it.all figured out, you're wrong!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I chose this book because of the rave reviews and they were right  I recommend this to anyone who loves a good thriller.  Well done.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Fun for passing the time. Challenges your brain a bit and keeps you guessing. Good graphics and pleasant scenery. Worth the price.
0817439390|5.0|This is the best book for folks beginner intending on learning photography or improving their skills if they are more than a beginner. I started my photography hobby with this book and since then have read lots of books, some good, some ok and some downright useless. This is one book that I highly recommend to everyone because the best part is that it reads like a novel and explains the basic concepts without getting to technical. Other books get too technical and overwhelm the novice folks. ISO, Aperture and Shutter Speed are the key components to understanding photogrpahy and this is probably the best book to grasp the concept. The way Bryan explains ISO by comparing it to worker bees made me understand the concept the first time I read the book and I had to never look back again. I have recommended and given this book as gift to few close friends who had shown interest in getting started. I still go back to it from time to time and either refresh the basics or learn something new. The other book in the series which I love is Learning to see Creatively. Enjoy
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|This ia a very Fun game. It is VERY Addictive. Once you start playing it is hard to quit?.  Enjoy!
B00846F1YW|4.0|I love hidden object games and this is one of my favorites with the story line and different levels.  So far am having a blast solving the mystery.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The 3D graphics in this game is what I would call amazing. When you get farther in the game, your character is running so fast that it is more of a challenge then from the beginning. This game is a must buy product of the Kindle Fire.
030758836X|3.0|Yes this is a good read, especially as it builds, but call me old-fashioned,...the books conclusion, and ultimate lasting message, are deeply unsatisfying and, in lots of ways, unhealthy.<br /><br />As the conclusion grew more clear, I grew more irritated, almost to the point of calling it quits on the book even though I was 9/10ths done. Yes, we are in a media-crazed world where 20/20-like stories permeate the mass media briefly making celebrities out of ordinary, and often very un-deserving, folks. Yes, calculating, frighteningly manipulative people can be interesting to contemplate. However, I walked away from this novel with a bad taste in my mouth as it reminded me that such people can triumph, be celebrated, and move on with no memory of the past. Sort of like a movie where the obviously despicable lead character carries on for several hours with crazed, hurtful behavior to an ending where there is no resolution, no justice, and ulimately leads to despair as to the apparent invincibility of such a person(s). Of course it exists in our world, but do we really need to give such business any more of the spotlight than it already receives?
0385535147|1.0|Not much action in this book.  Struggled through reading the whole way through.  Expected more from a John Grisham book.
0671646788|5.0|Everybody should read this book. This book should be a requirement in high school. If you haven't read , don't even think twice about it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like this game but I opened it up one day and all my coins were gone I had just purchased Carmen and she was gone and so was my highscore.  I was pretty angry.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I used this APP when traveling and it really made my trip more enjoyable. We could plan where to go and what to wear. I also check quickly in the morning to see what's going on for the day. Sure beats wading through commercials on TV waiting for the weather report.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I do love having access to The Weather Channel.<br />Especially when on vacation. Weather I<br />the weather channel is literally at my fingertips
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Read the Parent Guide on IMDB before letting your tweens watch it, but it's a great movie - lot's of comedy and I loved the music!
B008OOYALE|5.0|well my friend showed me this game and i hav yet to stop playing this. we compare how cute our dragons are, thats how much of nerds we are.
B00A6TYCNQ|5.0|this so cool this is one of the best games I ever played and I'm a gamer!the only plroblem is that it will not let me play online please fix
B004BSFC46|3.0|As others have said, they don't make a lot of noise, sort of like a bead rolling around, but its a nice subtle ting and the baby can certainly hear it.  Our baby is only a month old so hopefully this will get him exploring the sounds fairly soon.  Since he's still pretty small it fits just fine though I can see how an older baby of a few months would be a bit tight.  He doesn't really care about them right now but its still too early to tell.  Anyway, they're cute, cheap and it doesn't hurt to try.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|The Lion King is a great movie.  I bought the regular DVD and the color and sound are just fine.  My son and I have a great time watching the movie together!
0451196716|4.0|but thats  probally what i would say about all of his books. a good read. makes you want to finish it.
0143118757|5.0|Gives great Insights into mediation. This book helps by giving you tools to help get to the main point of the problem by focusing on the issue rather than the person or the position that they are taking.
B000031EGV|5.0|DVD arrived fast, in perfect condition (NEW), and my friends loved the gift.  They especially loved the Spanish language option  on this DVD,<br /><br />Thank you.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|This game is fun enough.  I've played in on the Iphone and the controls seem to be a bit different for android phones.  I prefer the iphone on screen controls but this is a fun puzzle game.  I think the coolest feature is the ghost blocks that you can race in order to improve your time
B0040HERTY|5.0|Bruce Willis never lets his character show age nor weakness.  Every Die Hard adventure is better that the last.  For those of us who fell in love with him in Moonlight we are still loving every movie.  The car/helicopter scene was great.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This was an awesome series no regrets at all.it met all my expectations I look foreward to the next season
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Ok Grisham novel but nothing special. Good beach read. No exciting trial scenes or highly humorous episodes, which Grisham can do well.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This product was exactly what I was needing and it is very easy to use. Great for comfort. Price is just right.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A couple of great characters, but a sad story and very predictable. Nice writing, some scenes of beauty interspersed with absolute horror. If child abuse offense, slip this one.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The Bond franchise is still alive and kicking, every bit as intriguing today as it was when I was 4 years old. 50 years and a lot of remakes later, the Daniel Craig 007 is far better, far more credible than any, except for Sean Connery. This motion picture was well-planned to evoke sentiments from those who have followed the franchise, indeed, grown up with the franchise, over all these many years. Oddly, I have never been a fan of the franchise. I have been aware of its existence. I have seen its ebbs and its flows. Like many, I lost any interest I might have had when Connery left the franchise. Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton  and Pierce Brosnan were as about as nancy as they come, in my view. These Bonds were totally unrealistic and stood as forewarning to the coming metrosexualization of modern man. In a word, they were all too prissy.<br /><br />The franchise has remained fairly true to itself: a one man army defeats the bad guys single-handedly, But SKYFALL is an enigma. How is it that he reaches BACK into the past to produce the Aston-Martin, yet is just now meeting Moneypenny? I imagine that, like Brosnan and Moore, we are to overlook these quirks.<br /><br />I watched it more for the nostalgia and lure of neatly edited trailers that properly concealed the somewhat lackluster storyline, acting and action.  It took two days to watch. I just had better things to do. That it has survived 50 years is worth noting. I dare say that unless they let go of the bubble in which this franchise has managed to cling to life, they will not see another 50. All in all, it was right boorish, quaint, boring and sadly so.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|This is probably one of the best films I've seen. I know it's not 100% historically accurate but that doesn't subtract from the actual movie being terrific. I'm not a movie critic, I usually don't even have the patience to sit through one unless it's absolutely good. This movie pulled me in from the very start.
B001JNND9W|5.0|This movie is a cult classic and one Hell of a Joyride, keeps you on the edge of your seat!!!
B001NFNFIK|4.0|I know some people thought that Tommy Lee Jones would be the ideal character for Dave Robicheaux; I diagree.  I prefer Alex Baldwin.  Also, Ned Beatty has but a small part - John Goodman is the main bad character.  Don't buy it because of Ned.
158270208X|2.0|It's a book you write in. I thought it was more a book to read. I have plenty of note books. It does have some nice quotes
B009R6GN22|4.0|This book was well written in depth account of Marilyn's life, non-judgemental, fair , with instances that I hadn't known.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I missed one of the episodes on tv and couldn't wait to find out what I had missed so I watched it here on Amazon.  The download was very fast and there weren't any problems watching it.  No lagging or dropped signals.  Just a clear picture from start to finish.  I use headphones and hear so many more things by watching programs and videos online than I ever would on our old tv even though it does have stereo sound.  This is a great way to watch tv, movies and more.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I am a Trekie and this was too good a deal to pass us. I had the VHS tapes for all the movies but didn't want to give them up because the spine of VHS tapes make a picture of the Enterprise. The DVD's are also conveniently packaged plus you have an additional DVD interviewing five of the main actors from the movies. If you love Star Trek, get these.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Love, Love - Love this Speedlight - it is everything I need, fast and reliable and easy to use.  I am just amazed with how wonderfully this changes the whole picture - it was a great investment.
B005LAII0I|5.0|This is a very sweet live action version of Snow White. Julia Roberts does an excellent bad character. Didn't think I would ever see her in this type role but she did it with great style and became someone you loved to hate. Only thing that was a distraction is the Snow White's eyebrows. Goodness, hasn't anyone ever showed this child how to correctly style her brows without them looking like Groucho Marx? Other than that, a really good movie.
B0076DELIG|3.0|MC is a terrific writer and I've read them all...some twice.  Bosch is my favorite character.  But I didn't love this one.  And I miss Eleanor Wish.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Just finished my first game of Elder Signs, and I must admit, I was impressed. Great graphics, good sound, good solid game play and tough as the devil (or perhaps I should say Cthulhu to beat!) There are some issues with the Kindle Fire, but that was easily got around, and I would still highly recommend this game. Every game is completely random as is the board game, and provides plenty of strategy and good planning. You won't beat it every time, and allows for several levels and even new scenarios. If you are a fan of the Cthulhu mythos, then this should be a definite purchase. If the videos poop out on you because of the Kindle Fire's un-stable ability to play videos within the game, do not give up on the game. Go to the website and find the videos on Youtube and work from there. It ain't rocket science and you should be able to figure it out. It is definitely worth the $3.99 price.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I think Grisham's story lines had become rather weak some years ago and I was pretty discouraged but this is one of his best.  What a story!!  This has to be a movie...
B008PE9GSA|5.0|What's not to love? Great band, great music, great album. Love listening to this in the car on my way to and coming back from work.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|After giving up on The Gate House a few years ago this is a real page turner.  Great story and Corey is a hoot as usual...perhaps a little overboard even.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Lots to remember,lots to think about and lots to learn. What else is there? Just be and enjoy the read.
141659521X|5.0|This book has only got one problem...it doesn't include an instruction manual. Because of this, I will supply my own set of instructions for all of you new readers:<br />CAUTION - Start reading this book on a Saturday morning.<br />1 - Eat your breakfast<br />2 - Make yourself a big jug of coffee<br />3 - Start reading<br />4 - Stop reading,make your breakfast and go to bed...You must go to work on Monday !<br />WARNING - Do not start reading this book whilst on the toilet...You will end up with a big red circle on your bottom - trust me, I know what I'm talking about !<br /><br />6 STARS for VINCE !
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|this is what a super hero movie should be I enjoyed it I would not buy the dvd if I did not like it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Just one more reason I LOVE my Kindle Fire HD.  How fun to be able to look at Facebook while using my Kindle.  This makes my Kindle seem like more of a bargain than I thought.  Seems to have all the features of FB on line.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I love this movie it is one of my favorite bond movies daniel craig should get more credit for playing bond, he plays him this way and it works for me, and the theme song is a killer love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game. lots of fun. nice to pass the time. i love playinv with these hirses and you dont have to buy anything for money great

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this sweet tail of love and surviving the impossible..it gives you that warm fuzzy feeling when you finish reading it. I'm excited for the movie was well
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I'd say this was a great purchase! My son has watched it back to back (along with the bonus dvd) for the last two days.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|Lost girl for me has reached Buffy status! I rewatch episodes over and over again while showing it to people that have never heard of it before....creating Lost girl addicts! I'm so happy I bought this series because between the stories and the characters on this show it truly gives you a sense awe and amazement that in my opinion hasn't been on tv since Buffy lefted!
B003O86FMW|5.0|LOVED IT !<br />I'm so excited for the movie this November!!! Can't wait !!!! Countdown begins lol (( love the hunger games ))
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is a good game my grandchild love to play this game<br />I think all will like this app if you have kids around
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfer is a really good game. I say that because it's a good game for babies just learning how to walk,crawl,and jump. Also,it gives me something to do in my free time and when I don't have anything to do
0143038419|5.0|I found myself in this book. Ms. Gilbert was so gracious to take us along on her journey. I listened to the book first, then decided to buy it so I could refer to it from time to time.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Difficult, but not so hard that you can't win. Tons of levels &amp; more coming, yay! No glitches. Highly recommended.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Does the Job and shipping was fast. . Great product. I would buy one again. It was too big for one of my outlets but it was due to the outlet being small. Charger is fine.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horse is so cute pet it and take care of it is fun. Feed it too I love this app.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|So real, so painful ,but Beautiful. I was brought to tears so many times.It didn't matter what language it was in.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|Enjoy Kelly Clarkson's music.  I have been listening to it for weeks now and its really good. Keep up the good work!!!!
0385535147|5.0|I enjoyed this book. a fast and exciting read.  Recommended to others. One of the best Grisham books in my oppinion.
B000002JSP|4.0|Why the vinyl album version of this was covered over by a brown paper bag and since then I've even seen a few versions of the cd out on the market with the same configuration (if someone happens to see this drop me a quick note about it) I always thought it was bizarre as if someone thought that the picture was offensive or something. But I had and have seen more things that were more offensive than that since then. But that seems to be all in the past now (said with strong sarcasm).
0062215507|5.0|My grandson has everything Harry Potter, and we both enjoy adding to his collection.Thank You.  It was great to see his smile opening the package on Christmas Day.
B007MG360G|5.0|WOW for such a simple game I love it. The combinations you make are sometimes funny. Sometimes they make total sense when you think it through. I highly recommend all three of these games.
0443069522|5.0|A gift for a friend but it seems Excellent<br /><br />A gift for a friend but it seems Excellent<br />A gift for a friend but it seems Excellent
2218951983|5.0|I like it. Every page is clear and well made. The cover is strong a durable for sure. Easy to understand and it comes with some french grammar explanations. Just in case, its all in french so don't expect to find any english in it
B00486070K|5.0|I had no difficulty connecting my Charter Modem to my MacAirBook via the Ethernet Cable supplied by Charter.  I recommend this product without reservation.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I got this game for my children..I'm playing it with them! it is so fun! its free...and it reminds me so much of the original Mario brothers. good job!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The basics of this game are mainly like Temple Run. But this is harder. It is more fun than Temple Run because there are more challenges.The trains Move! There is different editions and It's just a Great Game!
B001AUKUUO|5.0|Great cd and love it white lion is good  and there hit waite  is good and they got a lot of songs on it if i was y'all get there cd
B0010SKUYM|4.0|The book is well written and has a unique feel to it, however I found that there really didn't seem to be an ending. I understand that it is a part of a series, but every book still deserves to feel as if it has its own climax, and that doesn't happen here. Still well worth reading for fantasy fans.
B0000CEB4V|3.0|I read the reviews; I see where most rated it a \\"5 star\\".  I'm not saying I disagree. I only love GOD more than this particular man. Yet I feel like I came away with a different perspective on the film. Not that the performances weren't first rate; they were, especially Jeff's \\"The Inner Light\\", which was so sincere and heartfelt, I could feel his emotion right through the tv.<br />What I COULD NOT manage to overcome: the recurring expectation of George to come out onstage at some point.  Maybe it's just me, but that made me feel anxious, and I can't seem to shake that feeling every time I've gone back to watch it.  He's MISSING and you KNOW IT. So, for me, I just can't sit through it more than once, every once in a while, with long breaks inbetween.  I recommend it highly, believe me. Definitely should make it part of your \\"collection\\". I'm just stating my personal experience...and I'm betting I'm not the only one. It's been 11 years and I guess I'm just not there yet
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like this game and have fun when the game works unfortunately the game only loads like half the time.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I don't care what he does, there is no comparison to the sound of his voice. It just takes your breath away. Never disappointed.  I know all the words to &#34;Brave&#34; already just hearing him sing it on every show he's been on to promote it! I just can't say enough about the guy................looking forward to seeing him at the Hollywood Bowl this July
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Finally a Amazon game that I can relax to. It is something soothing and after a long day of stress I can calm down with this. I wish that it wasn't a timer sometimes. But I guess I can just block that out just like the stress. I think after I am done here I will play again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story, from start to finish....Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful writer!!!  Gripping story line ...a love story/thriller mix!!!  Loved it!!!
B007Y36K46|5.0|This is such a great movie how can I do it justice with this review? You just have to see it. No spoiler alerts either. Just get this movie. I've watched it several times and I still haven't seen and understood everything in it. Worth watching over and over.
B000NVLE7O|5.0|Since I was 13 years old I am building models. I had to suspend my hobby because I had no where to buy shops until I found and bought on Amazon. This model revell has any amount of detail, it is worth its price. Research in several sites Tamiya models, Trumpet, etc and always looked better Revell. If you have a hobby models arming, let me tell you that you will not regret if you buy this. It's almost a museum level. I give it 5 stars because it arrived on time, the relationship between price and product quality above all and most importantly, the instructions are well detailed, color schemes, etc..two thumbs up
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have been a Grobanite from the very beginning.  This beautiful and sweet man's talent is untouchable....he is magical.  Since my husband has an online country mag, I jump in from time to time to post reviews of CD's or shows.  And I got the big man to start posting cross-over reviews of non-country music...aka...Josh Groban.  Here was my latest review...    The magical man has gone and done it again...yet this time he outdid even himself.  In an exciting twist of sorts, Fathom Events organized a new way to enjoy seeing and hearing an artist's new collection of vocal poetry.  A certain number of movie theatres who were privileged to be honoured with a live performance airing on the big screen, were able to offer a special night of music and laughing on the eve of this man's highly anticipated CD release.  The host?  Well, of course it was none other than the ever sweet and humble man with THE voice....Mr. Josh Groban.    Yes, Josh recently released his latest CD, \\"All That Echoes\\".  And he really did it in style.  Josh performed onstage for a small crowd before him, but exuded his warmth to all his fans nationwide lucky enough to have been notified of this one night performance (mainly thru his fan club).  And let me tell you - there's one thing about buying a new CD and just listening to it for the first time...and then there's seeing the emotion and spirit emanating from the very expressive personality of a very passionate soul right before your eyes.  It most definitely raises the \\"wow\\" factor when you later get to just listen to that music and reflect on the performance.  This definitely was an exquisite introduction to Mr. Groban's splendid new arrangement of expression in song.  Josh was -as always- charming, funny, witty, humble, and magnificent.  In a word...the night was magical (best birthday present ever).    Now - before I start to really talk about the brilliance of his most recent project, I want to stress that this CD is by FAR one of his absolute best.  Seriously, I daresay even if you're not a Grobanite or really into classical music -you truly have to give this a listen.  Josh's scintillating voice is beyond gorgeous in every track recorded.  He has remarkably stayed true to his sumptuous vocal talents.    The CD opens up with his new release, \\"Brave\\", which is an imposing inspiration of learning how to pick yourself up in the face of adversity, fight your fears, and rise above that which challenges you.  This song  will quickly become a glorious motto for anyone struggling with any of life's daily battles.  \\"Brave\\" is definitely one of those power pieces that follows in the footsteps of \\"You Raise Me Up\\" and \\"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\\" - strong, feel-good compositions that you cannot help but want to burst out singing along to.  In fact, much of his latest CD has that kind of vibe...whether it's a heavier expression in \\"False Alarms\\" to more nostalgic songs in \\"Below The Line\\" and \\"Happy In My Heartache\\" - you'll easily find yourself humming right along.  Continuing on this track of thought is another compelling tune in \\"I Believe (When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever)\\".  This is actually a cover from the ever romantic Mr. Stevie Wonder.  This song brings in beautiful vocal harmonies accompanying Mr. Groban and invites you to incorporate your own vocals.    And true to his artistic nature, Josh has a nice bundle of Spanish and Italian ditties that speak of love, strength, and admiration.  But honestly??  Does it really matter what the meaning of the songs are when they're sung by that tantalizing velvet-like voice that just draws you in no matter what is truly being said in an English translation?  For those that it does matter to - the song \\"Un Alma Mas\\" is a very sexy, sultry Spanish tune that features a trumpet solo by Arturo Sandoval.  There are also several Italian compositions, \\"E Ti Prometterò\\" -a very stunning and breathtaking duet with Laura Pausini.  Their voices blend very beautifully in this song about promises of endless love.  \\"Sincera\\" is an expression of sincerity for always being there in strength and being true.    A wondrous bonus on this CD would be the many exquisite songs chosen by Josh to record as cover songs (besides \\"I Believe\\").  The first one you'll come across is from the Tony Awarding-winning Broadway musical `Once' - the song, \\"Falling Slowly\\" is poignantly alluring and Josh's very expressive vocals bring in that much more emotion.  That feeling continues with the Irish folk song, \\"She Moved Thru The Fair\\", which includes an impeccable violin solo resembling that rich Irish sound that reminds one of bagpipes.  And on the deluxe edition of this ethereal compilation (available at Target) includes three other superb cover songs.  One of them is \\"Changing Colors\\" (Great Lake Swimmers) -and let me just say this song is absolutely breathtaking.  Josh sings with such passion and soul.  My daughter loves this song so much she's already choreographing a dance for her spring dance recital.  Next is Dave Matthew's \\"Satellite\\" which is really moving and has incredibly beautiful harmonies.  And finally, Mr. Groban did Neil Diamond proud with his version of \\"Play Me\\".  That was one of the cover songs sung during Josh's last tour, and the crowds just absolutely loved it.  So believe me -it's such a special treat that Josh recorded it for all of us to now have forever.    This man is so full of astounding talent, wit, and charisma that just keeps growing and flourishing.  And with his latest collection, there's nothing short of incandescent perfection in every song.  This latest CD is simply brilliant and hopefully one that Mr. Groban is very proud of himself.  \\"All That Echoes\\" will definitely have many `echoing' these melodies wherever they go.  And on a side note, it's a magnificent addition to a candle-lit bubble bath.  There's nothing more alluring and relaxing than immersing in a tub with Josh's ravishing voice intoxicating your senses.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|I got hooked watching Season 3 of Dowton Abby, but was missing the background for some events and characters.  My friends said I had to see seasons 1 and 2 to understand. I am so happy I did. I have watched and re-watched the episodes. They are great!
B002N5N5R0|5.0|I bought it as almost new and it still came as brand new.  It also came well ahead of the scheduled date.  Couldn't ask for more.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty cool. Allows you to actually take care of a horse like you would in real life. I would definitely recommend it for children.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I love the fact that you do not have to use internet to play this game. It helps pass the time.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I love this book I think it's historically funny! My favorite part was when the boys went trick or treating  for Halloween
B003M6FGTE|5.0|It is hard to resist getting involved with the lives of these talented kids!<br />I'm a person who loves and misses the musicals of 50 - 60 years ago.<br />Glee is entertaining with a contemporary relevance.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|you really have too read ''The Fall Of Gaints&#34; first because some of the characters are in &#34;Winter of The World&#34;
B000TDGGRY|3.0|I was disappointed to some degree. The story line was good and the characters were well portrayed but the book got lost with way to much detail and hard to keep you invested in the story.
B005PR2FD8|2.0|This movie isn't all that great. The story is hard to follow, and doesn't make much sense even if you've played the game. The aminamtions are really good, but are a bit off sometimes. The  humans look stiff and movement at times doesn't really look all that great. I also hate the fact that the movie wasn't in HD. The copy I was received was in 480p. Overall, I really don't recommend buying this. Whatch it somewhere else for free.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|the colors just overwhelmed me. too many bright colors and too many different patterns. I uninstalled before finishing my first in Timed Puzzle Mode. kindle fire
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks never disappoints. It's a great book to read, has a great plot and many twists a long the way :)
034580404X|5.0|From the moment I opened the first book until I finished the last page of the last book, I was completely hooked.  While some of the information contained in the book might put some people outside their comfort zone, (at times, even me)  I was completely fascinated from start to finish.  I bought the set because I saw the women on \\"The Chew\\" discussing it, and had seen the first book on the best sellers list.  All 3 books were read within a week of receiving them and I have already passed the books on to a friend so she can read them too.<br /><br />If  you are looking for a good read that you can't put down, I highly recommend this trio.
1932100660|5.0|Clearly there is an agenda to mark as \\"unhelpful\\" any positive review of this book. Do not be dissuaded... this is an excellent book.<br /><br />I am not a diet fanatic nor a vociferous reader of diet and nutrition books. Every so often I do read a book that affects me in a profound way and more recently one of those books was In Defense of Food. Prior to reading In Defense of Food, I had read this book, The China Study. My impression of In Defense of Food was that it largely presents the same message that Dr Colin Campbell presents in The China Study.<br /><br />The China Study is an eye-opening book and is thoroughly engrossing. It was shocking to me to learn that many of the diseases that have plagued the last couple generations of people in the United States and other \\"affluent\\" countries, has coincided with the rise of institutionalized food production. This was one of the most important revelations I had as a result of reading this book.<br /><br />What you eat, and how much you eat is really going to influence your health and longevity. Dr Campbell presents the results of study after study and statistic after statistic to make this clear. And it really does make total sense to me.<br /><br />We have moved away from a largely plant and vegetable diet to one of processed foods, meat and dairy. Our health has suffered as a consequence. Obesity is killing people and our children are following in our footsteps.<br /><br />This is an important book that helps to get you out of the \\"bad\\" food trap that industrialized food production has gotten us into. Dr Campbell also discusses why it's not very helpful just to pop a few vitamins and/or nutrition supplements into your mouth to make up for a lifetime of bad eating habits.<br /><br />As a result of reading this book I have not gone total vegetarian but I have certainly reduced my consumption of dairy and red meats. It makes sense to do so on so many levels. My conclusions are drawn from not just this book, but from several notable books. For me, moderation and diversity makes sense. And eating organically grown foods that have higher nutritional value than commodotized, commercially produced foods can certainly be an improvement in any persons diet.<br /><br />Reading this book could get you on a more healthy path of eating that could change your life for the better. It's fascinating and perhaps life-saving if not at least life-enhancing.everal notable books. For me, moderation and diversity makes sense.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book because it is based on a kid who is special, it is a great book and I did not know that even though my whole school talked about it an tell I read it and saw the movie!!!  All ages should read this book .
B008PNBU30|5.0|I am a big Three Days Grace fan.  I was sorry to hear that the lead singer is no longer with them, but I have to say this album<br />is awesome.  I can't get enough of it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a good book and I loved it, it was such a good story and it makes me want to read the rest of the series.
B009NYF2ES|1.0|This rating applies only to the supposedly &#34;new&#34; HD/Blu-ray release and not a review of the movie itself.<br />Contrary to the product/packaging claims, this DVD is NOT HD/Blu-ray! If anything, it is simply average SD, including the audio. There are some interesting extras, but not worth buying due to the false/misleading claims.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Pretty slow till I got half way thru it then got really really good. Then The ending got slow again.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a very easy entertaining game that I have spent many hours enjoying. I like the auto move when tap.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Engaging, quality fun. A romp filled with danger, humor, and nostalgia. If you remember the 80's, read it. It's a good time.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I was able to pre-order item before it was officially released and got a lower price when it came out!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Awesome! Love this show and the depth of it's storytelling. Show gets you hooked and won't let go. Sad that it's ending in 2013 though.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't wait to see season 3, I was hooked after watching season1 ep# 1. This is one of the best mini series I've ever seen.
B000FC1MCS|3.0|Well written but depressing.  People are a mystery Christopher can't solve and he is a mystery they can't solve, even with love.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|After reading the first two books straight through, I was surprised to find that I found the third book too repetitious and not able to hold my attention. I still haven't finished it after over eight months.

B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Couldn't do anything with it. Would not read pdf attachments to email. Was not able to download reader to Kindle Fire HD 8.9
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Love this, it is an easy read, it's  like a workbook and at first I was like uh oh.... but I have to say it really reminds us what we have to be grateful for everyday.  Though I'm done reading it, it did the trick, not a day goes by without being grateful and feeling blessed.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|An epic  journey into the complex world of Downton Abbey, following the interelated lives of the Gratham's and their staff.
B000A59PMO|4.0|Liked the Show, great DVD and I did not have widescreen TV when the show was running.  It looks great on widescreen TV.
B005LAII12|4.0|Loved the witty script and great visuals, Seth is great love most all things he does. Ted is definitely a movie people of my generation can relate too. It talks to all of us in multiple levels. Watched it 3 times in a couple days to catch it all
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is the funniest movie I've ever seen. Its also a love story. Watch it to see if its true. I realize its CGI but this movie is hilarious. Who knew. Steve Carell, as Russian Super-Villain Gru.<br />While plotting to steal the reducing ray from Vector, his arch nemesis, he devises a scheme to use three cookie selling orphan girls because they got inside. Hmm! A plan comes into focus.<br />He decides to adopt them and along the way in this incredible journey of growing pains and acceptance they all come to look at each other in a different light. Just watch and be surprised.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Banks scores highly with this Culture novel concerning the final moments of a civilisation and what could happen if the civilisation in question had possibly been bases on a lie. The novel also gives a glimpse into the workings of the Culture eschewing the usual Contact or Special Circumstances connections and focusing instead on the emergence of a group of interested Minds.<br /><br />Banks' style is as sure as ever, and it is a wonderful educational read for those exploring the English language.
0385344333|1.0|The people that were critical of this book were dead on. I should of heeded their warning!<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the Lee Child/Jack Reacher books. I've read every one, but I should of listened to other reviewers and skipped this one.<br /><br />Out of 405 pages, well over 300++ pages were wasted with Reacher and other automobile occupants driving from one place to another. Their dialog, banter, and private thoughts became pretty boring. If you're looking for typical Jack Reacher action, then you need to skip to the very end of this one.<br /><br />Frankly, I feel embarrassed for Lee Child for being the author of this novel. Just skip this one and save your money. At the very least, look for a very, very, very, cheap, used edition.
B0042FZOFU|2.0|This item is not a USA product and would not work in our Blu-ray player.  Packaging was a little flimsy.  Disney Rewards points did not work either.  All inserts were for the UK website.
0393338398|5.0|2nd best baseball book ever written. a modern day solution to overpriced baseball players and how management can improve their teams.
0470876417|3.0|If you someone who follows the business press regularly than chances are that you will know 90% of what you will read in this book already.  For example the authors identify four objectives for business model innovation: 1) satisfy unmet market needs; 2) bring new products to market; 3) disrupt existing market; 4) create entirely new market.  Pretty obvious stuff once you read it.<br /><br />However, the book does do a nice job of aggregating the ideas behind a number of business model concepts into a single consolidated work.  And therefore it will not only reinforce some familiar concepts, but provide a framework for comparing these different business models.  For example, the authors review several of the newer 21st century business models - the long tail (amazon, iTunes); multi-sided platforms (Google, Facebook); Free (Skype, Gmail); and as-a-Service (Car2go, Zipcar).  You will find many other books discussing each of these different business models, but not a book that compares and contrasts them.<br /><br />The original appeal of the book to me was its visual layout.  Business Model Generation is rich with graphics, illustrations and iconography.  However, as I actually read the book I found the visuals to be distracting and confusing.  I suspected whatever artist developed the graphics had very little understanding of the written content.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I read all of the books, but the reason I rated this lower is because it is hard to wade through all of the characters and incidental details.  If those were left out it would be a 2-3 very interesting book series, instead of the 5.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have 4 apps that are the same type of game and this one is by far my fav. :-)  Easy to learn and fun to play!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Here are the facts: Minecraft is a fun game in which you are in a world  of squares.  It is true that Minecraft updates later than the ipod, but it is still fun. It should be rated 5 stars rather than 4 and a half stars.
B00846F1YW|4.0|The graphics are great. This is one of the better find-it games I've played. I recommend this for everyone. Thanks for the fun. Plus I was able to purchase it during a one day free app deal. aeven better.
B00BAHKQW4|5.0|I had the same problem with not being to play the game on kindle fire.  After an update it works fine.  This is a really cool game!  Geek approved.
B00081U6EG|4.0|To be honest, most of this DVD is crap in my opinion.  In fact, for something that was supposed to celebrate the Fender Stratocaster, it's pretty pathetic with the sole exception of one artist.<br /><br />Having said that, I bought this DVD only for the one song performed by Gary Moore.  This single song is worth the price of the DVD.  Gary Moore does Jimi Hendrix's Red House, and if you haven't seen it, you can check it out on You Tube.  Do yourself a favor and check that clip out.  It's long (9:24), but it is oh so good!  I mean, he barely even gets warmed up till nearly the 5 minute mark!  By far, he blows away anything else on the entire DVD!  It's not even close!  I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan too, and although David Gilmore is on this DVD, his performance doesn't hold a candle to Moores.<br /><br />I had never before heard, or heard OF Gary Moore prior to seeing this. Watching him perform this Hendrix song is mesmerizing!  I really can't think of anyone I have ever seen other than Stevie Ray Vaughan who can express emotion and literally \\"speak\\" through their instrument like Moore does here.  This is so far beyond anything else on the DVD that It's nearly laughable!  He makes most of these other guys seem like amateurs.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Classic Pendergast novel in every way. Full of intrigue and mysteriously enough, answers. Constance story revealed. More family history. A must read for fans.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run 1, then when I saw there was Temple Run 2 I HAD TO GET THE APP!WORKS ON KINDLE FIRE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I PLAY THE APP,  ON MY KINDLE FIRE! I 'M ADDICCTED TO THIS APP SO TRY IT YOURSELF! BETTER GRAPHICS,  TOO! : D<br />- Bird Freak
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really enjoy this app. It is so much fun to play. You can build whatever you want for as long as you want. You can also play join game with friends using the same wifi who have the app. The price is questionable,  but the app is worth it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app has a sequel called Temple Run 2. They are both what I said above ( title) and both work on Kindle Fire because that's how I play the app ( on my Kindle Fire)  ! FIVE STARS LIKE TEMPLE RUN 2 !!!!!!!!!! TEMPLE RUN 2 IS ACCTUALLY 1 THOUSAND STARS!!!! : D<br />- Bird Freak
B004LWZWGK|5.0|LOVED the movie.  Great acting, great story and plenty of action.  Would suggest buying for anyone who likes a fast, exciting story.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|At first I was confused. Really couldn't quite get how to move along with the story. It didn't take long for me to become wrapped in it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Keeps both my 3 & 5 yr old entertained for a long time. Teaches small motor skills.it is difficult going to the next level. Sometimes hard to navigate.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Fabulous book!! It was refreshing to read a book that defends God, faith, and religion in a respectful  manner.  I left feeling like I now have a responsibility to be a better person and that it is the little things in life that make the most difference. Overall inspiring, beautiful book.
B00006DEFA|5.0|The acting and the costuming in this movie are superb.  I have watched it several times; and always enjoy it.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This author captures Steve Jobs in striking and exhaustive detail. This is an unvarnished picture of a genius. This author does not have the exquisite eloquence in his writing that a David McCullough possesses. Still this work has enduring value to those trying to understand Jobs or those looking for inspiration from his story.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not quite as good as book one with a lot of redundant material. But the ending makes up for the slower pace of the book.  Now book three is a must.
030758836X|3.0|Plot twists were great - maybe too good.<br />Expectations were not met in the end. I was thoroughly disappointed with the ending.
B000000XB9|5.0|My Dad loves CCR. This CD has everything on it he was looking for. He is more than happy with it.

B004L35GAQ|5.0|I order this for my husband who just found a song he liked, so wanted to surprise him, so I bought it.  I only knew one song too, but after buying it we have found over five other songs we like.  Not only do we like it, but so did our 19 yr. old daughter, 15 yr. old son and 10 year old.  This was definitely worth the money for all the songs we found that we liked and how many in our household that liked it too.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for<br /><br />Very comfy set.  We use several sets for our exercise equipment.  We may get a few more
B005I6EU48|5.0|The cover fit fine and makes using my Kindle Fire so much easier to hold. I do like the color red too.
B009C7JS14|4.0|use this quite frequently ! Fairly accurate for my local weather and to check on places I may be going to.
B009EANE3M|5.0|I am a big fan of this band.They have a great sound. I have all their albums. It is a great mix of rock, pop and hip-hop. Great driving music. If you listen closely to the lyrics, there are meaningful messages.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this game. Finally in the loop. I've played it so frequently that I see odd birds in my dreams that I'm compelled to launch.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|There are so many different musical styles on this album, and her voice is just remarkable - it completely changes. Such a talented artist!
B004W2UBYW|1.0|I thought this was good enough but he comes off sounding like a not so nice guy at times how is this for a good review
B009UZLRJE|5.0|The price on this box set is almost a steal. And the quality is top notch. I have watched every episode on each disc and no issues at all. I love this show.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|This is the type of treatment a great classic deserves. Sound, film transfer are all first-rate. The special features are indeed special, including the soundtrack for the film. My favorite was the interview with Peter O'Toole. Funny and insightful. This film needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible but since it won't be shown in IMAX, this is a great way to spend an afternoon at the movies.
B006E4QCXU|2.0|This app is entertaining for about 5 minutes before you close it due to boredom and delete it/Hide it away in a folder someplace.
B007REV4YI|5.0|What a fun ride. the film quality is perfect and the special features are well done. It was a perfect Bond movie that almost, and I stress almost, makes a person forget the Quantum of Solace.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I really like this game and my sister has it.She has an iphone and the app has a game to earn coins. I have a kindle fire and it doesn't have that. I wish it did.if you need a neighbor my id is cutelittledragons123
B009CVELHG|4.0|This is basically the same package that was done with the dvd. It looks better but doesn't raise the bar.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|As usual these guys have put out a rockin album. Love it! Come back to south western NY for a concert.
B007STBUIW|4.0|In the Lawrence of Arabia special features is an interview with Spielberg. He talks about how special and honored he felt sitting next to David Lean and getting a personal running commentary from the director. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to feel we are special enough to get the same treatment. One of the greatest directors in Cinema and he has never provided any commentary on any of his films. This is a great film, done well in Blu-ray but it's missing that feeling that Spielberg got sitting next to David Lean.
B001EBWING|5.0|Got drunk with a young lady and she decided that she wanted to watch this. Needless to say her pants  were off 20 minutes into the film. Five stars for Humphrey Bogart. Five stars for vodka. Five stars for me.
B008VNIBFO|5.0|This is what a Blu-ray disc should contain and look like. Plenty of content and the picture quality is reminiscent of a perfect pristine first-run film. Would love to see this on a big screen. &#34;It's the pictures that got small.&#34; So much truer today than when the film was first released.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Awesome! Not very good with my Kindle, just learning, but am thrilled to be able to check the weather anywhere around the world so fast and accurately. I know there are many ways to this app so am looking forward to learning more.  Thanks
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is an Engineers dream !!  The story was well done and its a Robinson Caruso on Mars.  The way he solved problems was great.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I read this book because I have friend who run marathons, are vegetarians and still don't lose weight.  To me this didn't make any sense.  The hypothesis of the book is that simple refined carbohydrates is the primer driver of fat formation.<br /><br />I'm a chemical engineering grad student and my friends are completely wedded to the calories in calories out hypothesis (thermodynamics must be true).  I've found that I can shut them immediately by saying:  &#34;I'll bet you however much money you want that I'll eat the my basal metabolic caloric intake in meat and you eat it in all sugar and beer and I'll lose body fat and you won't.&#34;  They won't take the bet because they know deep down inside that something is wrong there and it can't be true that &#34;a calorie, is a calorie, is a calorie.&#34;  If they would just read this book they would at least hear a well thought out and researched presentation of the counter argument.<br /><br />I've also read &#34;Good Calories, Bad Calories&#34;  by the same author.  The arguments in this book are more focused.  You can tell that Mr. Taubes got a lot of feedback after the first book and addressed the concerns quite aptly in this followup.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|AmazonBasics Multi-Tip Stylus is GREAT! The three tips are very convenient. The tips are super soft but super efficient to use! Really pleased.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Kept my interest for awhile but left me hanging now and then. Better reading for the very young or the very old.
B009O2XY12|4.0|This Bubble Mania is pretty fun, easy, and entertaining. I enjoy playing this bubble popping puzzle game. Great way to pass the time.
0316224588|5.0|Ian Rankin has seemed to be lost without his John Rebus character, and when Rebus returns, Rankin is at his best. I really liked this novel, and enjoyed the travels through Scotland that Rankin provides as well. Sorry to see Rebus still hitting the bottle so hard, but everything else clicked really well. The future painted for Edinburgh with the rise of the young new gangster and the advent of more sophisticated policing makes one wonder what future Rebus has. It doesn't seem like there is much left, but I wouldn't want Rankin feeling lost again...
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book...terrible ending; but still worth the read. There are enough twists and turns to keep you very entertained throughout.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|At first, I  thought that this would be geeky, but I really got into making my Dragons huge bosses. Just awesome.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Very durable. comfortable to hold and well made. The inside strap for your hand is nice extra. Material is very sturdy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The characters draw you into a world where you participate in the horror and the survival.  Can't get enough of this show.  The director and actors have my undivided attention.  Keep the story going.  I am a forever fan.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game to take my mind off snacking so much I'm enjoying the game works great i have no complaints 1.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|It was a great read with all the old Rebus attitude and a little Malcolm Fox to balance Rebus.  One of his absolute best.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|Action packed love the bond movies can watch over and over and over great for high def televisions hdmi is the way to go
B001NHN7TU|5.0|Part of the reason I love this movie is because I remember watching it with my big brother years ago. It might have received a poorer review without the sentimentality. Prepare yourself- it's cheesy. But so awesome!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I <3 this game it's AWESOME i love playing it i love the people and i love how it's so fun and creative i think it's for 4years and up because it's easy to get the moves down
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This is a very fun app, but... it LAGS! Horribly! Not a good app for the kindle fire!!<br />The lag is awful. Not a higly recommended app for kindle owners.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|It's a very good game you can controller your character. Kill zombies and skeleton. Very entertaining to some people 5 stars
B003719G40|4.0|I would recommend for all who assume their partners don't love them. You just might discover that they share their their affections in a different manner than expected.
B009X01C64|3.0|Because of the hinge and stuff, when closed it's quite thick, which was my problem with the prior one I had. Takes up space in a laptop bag. but it swivels nicely and does its job.
0399157565|1.0|It seems like this book was written like a stream of consciousness over one weekend.  Very boring and poorly written.  What a disappointment.
0399245030|5.0|Oliver Jeffers is a very talented picture book maker and this is probably his best book. I strongly recommend it to kids but especially for adults
B00784Y29G|1.0|Bleak.  No annotations, no notes, no commentary.<br />No table of contents.<br />Lines are not typeset as they are in the print edition.<br />Characters identified in abbreviation.<br />Prose lines and poetry lines set in center of page.<br /><br />Do not bother with kindle edition.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Few funnier movies than this; every viewing.  A little concerned, based on some of the reviews, that the video and/or sound quality of this DVD might be substandard, but overall, it's fine.  The video jittered a little on the intro., which is a cartoon, but that quickly resolved and from there on, the video quality is very good; maybe not the best HD Blu-ray, but obviously one.  The soundtrack isn't all that great; 2-channel and sound levels aren't totally consistent (might have to adjust the volume once in a while to hear the voice track), but it's okay overall.  Bottom line, great movie, really good video, acceptable audio.  We'll be watching this one every holiday season.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is one of the best games I've seen that really puts your brain to work. A lot of thinking and not allowing your eyes to mislead you. I thought it was going to be some stupid puzzle game like Rubicks cube that just had no fun to it at all. I was so wrong! If you want something fun, entertaining, addictive AND good for the brain, I HIGHLY recommend this game! Very rarely do I comment on games or score them, but this one deserved the 5 stars!
B005HSG3TC|2.0|The poor rating is due a partial refund.  In the search bar I entered &#34;cover for kindle fire 8.9 inches&#34; this came up, so I ordered it.  What came was a case for a 7 inch, way too small.  Returned it, but only got a partial return.  Keep in mind I've been ordering from Amazon for about 10 years ordering a lot (all my xmas shopping, birthdays, everything).  Out of all my years I've only had to return a few a items.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It's perfect for my kindle fire! It's exactly what I needed to protect the tablet. I would recommend it if you are taking your kindle anywhere out of the house.

B00280LYIC|4.0|This was a great book about a boy who finds he is a half-blood and unspeakable things happen to him. The book tells his adventures. I would recommend this book and all of the others.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished reading Hopeless last night.  I cannot stop thinking about Holder and Sky.  They owned me from the very 1st page until the last.  I wanted to feel the anticipation of that 1st kiss, the 1st of many,

B00846REIS|5.0|Awesome bookI! I could not put it down! I thorougly enjoyed the storyline and the characters. The book does end with you wanting to read the next book. I plan to read more books by this author!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I love reading Rick Riordan's work.  It is imaginative, but at the same time, factual to some degree.  I have studied Ancient Egyptian gods in the past, but I apparently never learned about SET, BAST, NEPHTHYS, and some of the other gods and goddesses mentioned in this book.  Can't wait to read the second book!!!

B001F12J48|1.0|Worst quality video and 3D. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I cannot believe they sell this as a 3D movie.
B0053KWDES|4.0|I used the E11 with a speaker/subwoofer system, [[ASIN:B000CMS0XU Audio Technica ATH-AD700]], [[ASIN:B001LNO722 Monster Turbine IEM]], and [[ASIN:B002VPDOHS Sennheiser PX 200-II Headphones]]. Although the E11 finally died on me after about 6 months of use, I was impressed enough by the performance of the amp to still recommend it.<br /><br />A word of caution, audiophiles tend to over-hype audio products, and the E11 is no exception.<br />Although the E11 will moderately improve sound quality with the right speakers, it will not work magic.<br />As an average user, I have found that most audiophiles tend to make a big deal over something that I (and my friends and family) cannot hear, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) Works well for improving sound volume for speakers that tend to be quiet or lacking in clarity. Even cheaper speakers seemed to benefit from the E11.<br />2) Convenient size for excellent portability. I usually carried it in my pocket. Also, the battery lasted for a reasonable amount of time.<br />3) Does a good job at making musical instruments more distinct. The E11 definitely boosted my music's clarity. The bass boost will add some whump to your life.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) The bass boost may add whump, but it's hardly comparable to a good equalizer. The bass boost tended to muddy up my sound, so I turned it off and used my Itouch's equalizer app instead.<br />2) Not the sturdiest of products. The E11 spent most of its life in my pocket, yet somehow ended up being dented, beaten up, scuffed, and fairly ghastly looking by the end of its life.<br />3) The \\"in\\" audio port started turning my stereo sound into mono sound, which killed its usefulness.<br /><br />I could have repaired it myself with a soldering tool, but FiiO glued the case to the board and prevented me from accessing the audio port area without damaging the E11.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the E11. I want another one, because the clarity it added to my music mademy listening more enjoyable. However, the fact that the design will likely fail<br />me again leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Perhaps I'll go find another brand.

1451620829|3.0|Let me start by saying I have been a card carrying member since '76. Have the kiss tattoo, pinball machine, Paul Stanley PS10 and so on and so on. Have read all the kiss books (including this one) and have a life long passion for anything kiss. I will be cremated in a kiss urn. In any event, it was interesting to say the least to get Peter's perspective on his time in kiss. After his lengthy battle with drugs,while in kiss, it is no wonder he was never given any meaningful input(according to Peter). Just picture you as a business owner and your partner is messed up on dope and booze, behaving like he should be put in a straight jacket. And the pissing and moaning how he was always taken advantage of.....\\"Ace was getting paid that...and I'm getting paid this?\\" How much was he making prior and after his two departures? He certainly acknowledges his demons and shortcomings, but keeps on blaming Gene,Paul and everyone else ever associated with the band. Ace and Gene also paint similar however different pictures of each member's rolls, so you can take each with a grain of salt, to a certain extent. It was an easy read. Not worth the price. Still a life long fan!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel will appeal to an older generation even though there are young lovers in it. Only one oldster (Maggie Smith, of course) noticed the bumbling would-be hotel entrepreneur, stumbled into noticing the outcast of the Hindu caste system, and had such wonderful one-liners. Her timing is impeccable. Of course, I'm writing from the perspective of an older generation. This reminded me of spending 18 months in Mexico city. The culture shock is/was incredible to those who haven't traveled to other non-English-speaking nations. This shock was illustrated graphically through the photography.

B004499LX0|1.0|This is what debased minded actors do when they have far too much financial wealth and recognition. Should this have been the first film they ever made, they would have never been asked to act in anything ever again. Shame on them using such filthy writing in chat-rooms and filthy talking amonsgt themselves. In my opinion, the writers and directors are reprobate perverts in every way, who most likely need meds to sleep at night and who live deformed lives in the day, lives which must be driven by every demon in hell having a ball polluting them. I am disgusted that these actors egos made them graduate to such low levels, right into the gutter and cesspool of utter shame and perversion.I refused to watch this trash until the end. It is outright immoral, disrespectful and ammoral. All of them are contributors of turning the world into the mess it's in. I don't care if it was made 10 yrs ago! DON'T SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS!

B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I've been a fan since Jack White covered \\"Walking With a Ghost\\" and I looked to see who really wrote it.  Thanks,  Sara! (and of course,  thanks Jack White also).  Since that time I've become a big fan of these two talented musicians who produce great studio work,  but who are also  just plain fun to watch in a live performance.  And often lately (including on songs from HeartThrob) they can do a completely different version live that sounds at least as good as the studio tune...sometimes better.  Their stage banter is legendary.<br /><br />Since 2006,  I've heard most of the tunes they've done (as far back as Red Demo and Yellow Demo).  These two were extremely talented right from the start.  I've said for years that they'll never do a better album than  This Business of Art (listen to it after listening to Heartthrob and you'll hear some very different great performances when they were 19).  Now they're waaaaay old (32) and that refines their music a lot.  I'm glad to say that Heartthrob is the album that I've waited for.  It's as good as This Business of Art,  but in a far different style.  Don't be misled.  This is NOT a pure pop album.  Pop yes,  but overall it's Tegan and Sara.  Their style with a bit more beat and great harmonies.<br /><br />Listen to some tunes from the various albums and you'll hear their style.  This album has that plus those nice lively rhythms and harmonies overlaid.  Being a fan (not a young one either),  I can say this is the most listenable release for these two since This Business of Art,  but I'll listen to all the others as well since Tegan and Sara have no \\"bad\\" songs.<br /><br />If you do get a chance,  go see them live in a small venue.  That's where they truly shine.<br /><br />Congrats to T&S for an excellent release.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|\\"Bigger, Leaner, Stronger\\" gave me a new way to approach my workouts at the gym in a very straight-forward, comprehensible, and non-intimidating way. i'm on Week 7/Day 1 and so far, i've enjoyed every minute of the workouts from this book. although i'm not new to exercising or lifting weights, one of largest obstacles that i have faced in the past has been hitting a plateau within my workouts, and not being able to achieve a kind of longevity-of-routine; meaning that i would start hard and be motivated, but after about a couple of weeks, i would lose interest, and would skip going to the gym for one, two, three weeks, entirely. to date, my results have been very positive, but most of all, my strength has increased and i haven't been bored since i began using this book as my guide to working out. \\"Bigger, Leaner Stronger\\" is a magnificent resource about weightlifting, exercise and nutrition in general.

B005S9EK5Y|3.0|Les Misérables - The Movie 2012<br />Without a doubt the International show is superb. I saw the Grand Opening on Christmas day (December 25, 2012) at ArcLight in Sherman Oaks.  I admit that I am some what partial to the Actor/Actress who are the absolute top of the line.<br />I am an avid lover & follower of the Broadway Show and have see many of its performances.<br />The movie was exceptional.<br />Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russel Crowe all deserve the Oscar. All Five Star actors.<br />As for the voices of Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne, which appear weak. Possibly it's the sound track. Very disappointed in the voice, audiobility. Also, they lacked any emotion or drive.  In comparison to the 'other actors' their role was dull.<br />Samantha Barks, excellent acting & voice.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|DOWNTON ABBEY,  Season 1, 2, 3<br />The story has captivated my attention from the first time I saw Season1 on PBS So Cal. Absolutely perfect the way each character is blended with the other. One gets so intrenched with with each story line — it takes you out of this world of multi-problems and you become a part of the entire cast.  &#34;YOU ARE THERE&#34;  Although I own all the DVD's of all three seasons, I still go back a review ALL of them again.  Each time I catch a line that had been missed, or a scene the had been over looked.  I still watch each program on PBS So Cal each Sunday, although I know what will happen.  Waited impatiently for each season to be released,  The photography is out of this world, the outdoors, and especially the location.  Really enjoyed every minute to date.<br />However, the story can end here. !!!<br /> Loosing interest because you have eliminated two (2) of the main family characters. [Sybil Crawley & Matthew Crawley —Strange]<br />I have lost  interest in the new an younger people that are being introduced. Too much like TV America petty situation comedy (2013)  Ergo, I think you have/are turning a wonderful 'Classic Story' into a 'Modern Day Soap-Opera'... and we all know they are no longer on television. (personal belief)  I think that Julian Fellowes should have stopped after 'Mary Crawley' had her child... &#34;Grandson & Heir to Downton.&#34; Would have been a wonderful 'Cliff-Hanger'<br /><br />Now the story line/s have become disengaged— Also, Shirley MacLaine did an expected job of playing &#34;Shirley MacLaine&#34; !!!  (The last of the Rat Pack).  Outside of her, every star in 'Downton Abbey' deserves an Academy Award, non of course could top... Dame Maggie Smith.  Accolades to the Cast, Directors, Producers and writers.  Excellent job, enjoyed every minute... viewed over and over!<br /><br />Too bad this is the end for me,  IT Has now lost the magic... and becoming Standard America ; 'Situation Tragedy'.<br /><br/>Respectfully,<br />James-Alan Love<br />[First generation American, my parents-grandparents are from England]

B004I8WD6E|4.0|I love the Elago slim cases for the iPhone 4 but I've seen too many people with partially cracked iPhones with them on. I decided to get some solid protection for my iPhone 4 that wasn't Otterbox ugly, if you know what I mean. This case is fine. I wish more reviewers would mention that it's technically a soft case with a hard surface, if that makes sense. I can stretch/pull it on and off whenever I need to wipe dust off my iPhone. It's not the wonderful clear and hard, snap on case that I randomly found at a mall kiosk, but it's been doing what it's supposed to do.

0142501123|5.0|I teach first grade and I break this out from time to time for a read-a-loud. The kids are into it from beginning to end and they take note on how its wonderful and playful art is similar to the art of &#34;The Gruffalo,&#34; within the first few pages. I personally love The Gruffalo so much more, but this title holds its own with the rest my Julia Donaldson collection. Find and watch the British animated short when you get the chance! Down!

B009B8YZKS|5.0|A must own for any fan of Halo, Sci-Fi and/or Indy filmmaking..These were originally 5 webisodes that have been edited to run as a full length movie. A beginning has been added in a documentary style that fleshes out the characters within the film, something that the individual webisodes weren't always capable of achieving due to the 15 minute window each one ran. This is, by far, the difinitive version of the film and worth taking a look at.

B00007BK2N|4.0|I've been watching a number of Michael Winterbottom-directed movies lately, and this finally brought me to check out \\"24 Hour Party People\\".<br /><br />\\"24 Hour Party People\\" (2002 release from the UK; 117 min.) brings the story of how Tony Wilson, a host on regional Grenada TV in Manchester, became involved in the budding local music scene. The movie starts off with a terrific recreation but also using archive footage) of the Sex Pistols' first gig in Manchester in 1976, attended by 42 people to be exact as Wilson points out. We see Wilson becoming involved with bands like Joy Division and the Buzzcocks. The first hour of the movie, ending with the suicide of Ian Curtis in 1980, is nothing short of brilliant. The second hour of the movie is not quite as essential, covering the 1980s, as Wilson struggles with Factory Records and a nightclub called La Hacienda. But it remains thoroughly enjoyable until the very end. I do find the title of the movie quite misleading as this movie is not so much about \\"party people\\" as it is about the music scene in Machester in the late 70s and early 80s.<br /><br />Several comments: I really had no idea that the movie was going to be about the Manchester music scene of the late 70s and the 80s. As it happens, I love the music from that era, including of course Joy Division. In that sense the movie was a complete surprise to me and why it has taken me until now to see this movie, I have no idea. The movie is shot in a \\"cinema verite\\" style, in which Steve Coogan in the role of Tony Wilson frequently talks directly into the camera and gives commentary to what is happening on the screen and much of the scenes in the movie feel like a documentary. Sean Harris in the role of Ian Curtis is quite good as well. Please note that there are a bunch of great DVD bonus materials, including an interview with the real Tony Wilson and also a terrific documentary about Manchester. Bottom line: if you like indie-music from the late 70s and early 80s, you will not want to miss this. \\"24 Hour Party People\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!you will not want to miss this. \\"24 Hour Party People\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B008JFUMT2|4.0|\\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" (2013 release; 97 min.) is the fifth installment in the Die Hard franchinse. Can you believe that 2013 marks the 25th anniversary of the original \\"Die Hard\\" movie? Where has the time gone! The plot in the latest Die Hard is wafer-thin, something about our hero McClane's son being in a Moscow jail, and our hero going on \\"vacation\\" to check it out. Need more be said? No!<br /><br />Several comments: first, if you've seen the trailer for this, as I had several times in past month or so, you knew exactly what to expect in this movie. And that is exactly what the movie delivers (unlike, say, another recent movie \\"Broken City\\", which promised action in the trailer and proved to be a 'talkie'). The plot of \\"A Good Day\\" matters not one bit, as far as I'm concerned. What I was hoping for, and got, were over-the-top action sequences. Check out for example early on in the movie the outstanding car chase in Moscow, which truly defies belief as we're seeing it happening on the big screen. Also the concluding action sequence of the movie (involving a huge Russian helicopter) is pretty darn good. I also very much enjoyed the scenery in Moscow, a visit I have visited once many years ago. Looks like a lot has changed there.<br /><br />If you are looking for art with a capital A, and then are disappointed with this movie, it's a bit like going to a Britney Spears show and being upset you didn't get Mozart music. If on the other hand you are looking for a good action movie, \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" is exactly what the doctor has ordered. I was surprised how quickly the movie rolled by, and thoroughly enjoyed myself, as long as you don't take any of this too seriously. Relax and joy, yippee ki-yay!

B00AFEXRME|2.0|People now tend to laugh at 1950’s movies like “Reefer Madness” made with a reformer’s zeal for impressing on young people the horrors of drug addiction. But this movie is not far from that sort of mentality. Only it’s unlikely that “Flight” will ever achieve the status of being “campy.” Its preaching is too self-conscious. It takes a certain innocent obliviousness to produce a movie like “Reefer Madness” that becomes camp.<br /><br />Here the airplane pilot, played by Denzel Washington, anguishes over the fact that he was drunk and high when he maneuvered his defective airplane to a landing. So the film, intent on sending a message, sends a mixed one. The viewer is supposed to deplore the fact that Washington habitually flew his plane with at least a buzz on – and yet much of Washington’s skill seems to stem from his mind-altering indulgences.<br /><br />The film devolves into a commercial for AA, with a heavy dose of religiosity thrown in. When Washington wishes someone a “good day,” he is primly corrected. No, have a “blessed” day, comes the reproach. Washington, and by proxy, the audience, is made to pause to supposedly find some real meaning in this rebuke.<br /><br />The point of the film is not, as I thought, to take us through a crash scene investigation. The point becomes to pilot Washington into a 12-step program where he is chastened into proclaiming a mea culpa and where he is made to atone – for exactly what we’re not sure.<br /><br />If you want a real movie about the investigation of a plane crash to determine whether the pilot’s drinking was at fault, or whether there was some other cause of the accident, I suggest you check out the 1960’s classic “Fate is the Hunter.” Steer away from this nosedive into the drink.

B00APUTEBG|3.0|I've seen many a stinker and this is not one of them. The plot was derisive but so are all the Bourne films/books. What I liked here was that he doesn't save the day by brawn or brains, but simply by being in the right place at the right time. It worked. Cavill was very believable, even if the script wasn't always up to his performance.<br /><br />It was enjoyable all the more since it had a strong cast playing roles that are not so very typical in spy films. There are no real good guys/bad guys - it's all business.

Believed to be dead, MI6 finds their last, best hope to prevent information exposing agents embedded in terrorist organizations worldwide almost as dead in the water as Bond.<br /><br />Bond stays out of the public eye enjoying \\"death\\" but returns to offer his services to a very surprised M (Judi Dench)when MI6 is blown apart by Silva (Javier Bardem)a terrorist determined to take revenge against M and the agency at all costs.<br /><br />Bond unexpectantly finds that he has far more in common with Silva than he ever thought.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />When it was announced that dramatic director Sam Mendes was going to tackle the latest Bond film, there was a mixture of surprise and trepidation as he had never tackled an action film before. Mendes' experience as a director of stage and screen came in handy allowing him to develop a Bond film with more dramatic depth and heft than might have occurred otherwise.<br /><br />Many Bond films rise or fall (Skyfall)based on the set pieces in the film i.e., the action sequences embelished with plenty of stunts. \\"Skyfall\\" opens with an exceptionally good one that measures up to the stunning opening for \\"Casino Royale\\". Bond films also rise and fall based on how complex and interesting the villian is in the piece. Bardem does a good job creating a fascinating bad guy whose grip on his sanity is slippery at best. Bardem makes Silva much more interesting than your standard Bond villian and, perhaps, almost as colorful as Goldfinger or Blofeld. Now that EON productions and United Artists/MGM/Sony own [[ASIN:B00APD6O16 Never Say Never Again (Blu-ray Version)]] and the rights to Blofeld, maybe we'll see that character reintroduced in the next installment.<br /><br />The script by Joshua Logan with Neal Puris & Robert Wade effortlessly incorporates elements of older Bond films (in a nice tip of the hat in one scene to[[ASIN:B008YKV1T2 Goldfinger (50th Anniversary Repackage) [Blu-ray]]]), as well as, introducing new variations on old characters.<br /><br />Featuring (for the first time) some of the best known actors of British stage and screen, \\"Skyfall\\" sets a new standard for Bond films measuring up to the best reboot to feature Craig [[ASIN:B009A87ZQU Casino Royale (Blu-ray + DVD)]] and expanding to incorporate popular touches from previous films.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks terrific with a strong, detailed presentation. The audio is equally impressive with an immersive mix.<br /><br />The special features are another thing entirely. While the commentary track by director Mendes is terrific (noting tributes to other films and directors) and the one featuring producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli provides nice detail as well, the featurettes (which can be viewed as a single documentary if you choose)are a bit on the superifical side particularly when compared to the terrific ones for the classic Bond films. Still, they aren't bad--they do cover interesting material just not in depth by comparison to what we've seen in the past.<br /><br />We also get a standard DVD included with the Blu-ray as well as the option to watch the film via Ultra Violet.<br /><br />Bond's latest adventure returns luster to the series as the so-so reception for [[ASIN:B001PPLIFU Quantum of Solace [Blu-ray]]]. Actor Daniel Craig who has added a primal edge to Bond is signed up for at least two more outings. I'm hoping that they will be as good as this one and continue to develop the material that we see here in \\"Skyfall\\".<br /><br />Highly recommended.orates elements of older Bond films (in a nice tip of the hat in one scene to[[ASIN:B008YKV1T2 Goldfinger (50th Anniversary Repackage) [Blu-ray]]]), as well as, introducing new variations on old characters.<br /><br />Featuring (for the first time) some of the best known actors of British stage and screen, \\"Skyfall\\" sets a new standard for Bond films measuring up to the best reboot to feature Craig [[ASIN:B009A87ZQU Casino Royale (Blu-ray + DVD)]] and expanding to incorporate popular touches from previous films.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks terrific with a strong, detailed presentation.

B008YBOGVG|5.0|A radical departure for Marianne Faithful when it was released, the deluxe edition of \\"Broken English\\" includes the original album, a different sounding original mix that was previously unreleased along with a short film made by the late Derek Jarmen. The film can be viewed in enhanced CD mode.<br /><br />The previously unreleased original mix of the album features some tracks that are longer than the released version of the album. All of these tracks are sequenced exactly the same as the original album but are on the second disc. We also get Marianne's re-recording of \\"Sister Morphine\\" supplemented by the 7 inch edit and remix of \\"Broken English\\" as well as a long version of the same song (running 5:47) and a remix of \\"Why'd Do It\\".<br /><br />The spoken word track \\"The Letter\\" (not to be confused with the song by The Box Tops and Joe Cocker) is NOT included as it was recorded after the release of the album.<br /><br />The 24 page booklet includes photos of various single sleeves and alternate covers for the album from various countries.<br /><br />The remastering by Jared Hawkes is pretty good. It isn't quite as dynamic as the original CD release but it is far from the brick walled mess of many remasters/reissues. The new transfer also presents more detail than evident on the original CD issue probably due to better analog to digital converters.<br /><br />The only way I can think of to have improved this set would have been to put the short movie on a region free DVD and a vintage live recording of the material. This is a very nice set and if you are a fan of the album it is well picking up.
0156014041|5.0|This is a classic. The princes' pure heart appeals to reads in any language. With the background knowledge of the story (familiar to many people) the barrier many people face when trying to read something extensive in Latin can be overcome. Give it a try.
1423113454|5.0|I really love how this author spins a tale.  Although written for a teen audience, I fully and whole-heartedly enjoyed it.  Riordan somehow weaves in a lot of historical information about the Egyptian panopaly of gods, then directly involves his characters with them in the present moment.  Suddenly the whole landscape changes as the protagonists--a brother and sister--begin to find that the ancient gods of Egypt are suddenly alive and well.  I loved his premise and the young people's challenges and adventures.  He allows the reader to really get to know some of the most improbable beings which was a lot of fun.  I mean, an author who can somehow manage to fit Elvis Presley into the storyline and have it make sense is really amazing.  A very fast-paced fun read.  I highly recommend it. I am on to the next one.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|30 Rock is so well written, but this isn't much of a read.  Entertaining bits, but overall, get it from the library.

B007SGM084|4.0|This was a gift.  Not usually into such explicit sex but the story line gets you hooked.  I was afraid I wouldn't like the ending but I did.  Will be interested to see if she does a follow up book on these two.
0345803485|3.0|It took a while, but I finally finished this book.  Not exactly well-written.  Tired quickly of the main character referring to her &#34;Inner Goddess&#34; all the time.  Very juvenile.  Gave this book and the other 2 to a friend of mine who wanted them.

0765325950|5.0|Brings every player, every faction, every country, every plot together perfectly.  Well done!!!  This is the best series I've ever read.  Warning: the entire book is a climax.  You won't be able to go to bed on time until you finish this book.

B004A8ZWVK|1.0|The movie had potential BUT the language was very offensive - Cursing, Using God Name in Vain.  It deserves the trash can (because of the language that's where I put it).
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Every once in awhile you read a book that makes a difference in your life and this is one of those for me. This book will always be in my memory. To have a book bring such sadness then such joy is truly a gift.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is lots of fun and very addicting!  Can be choppy at times though but usually works itself out.
1400049628|4.0|Max Brooks writes so well and extensively about the fictional &#34;living dead&#34; that one might believe they are a very real and dangerous threat.<br /><br />I recommend reading this, as well as his more recent novel: World War Z - which I was a third of the way through when I had to put it down because I was told about this book and the fact that it gives a more complete description of his Zombie creatures. I ended up finishing both books, and am very glad I did.
B0063IH60K|5.0|its a great time spender plus its free I don't know who would not want to play this great game
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Excellent read. All any Reacher book could offer! Lee Child's story fits together like a puzzle. No gaps, no down time.
B003DT19F0|4.0|Kids couldn't get enough of it. Negative, I can't keep the kids from breaking up the cereal boxes to make little people houses, ugh.
B00797MB0O|2.0|Don't waste the time watching the full movie. Watch about the first 30 minutes, turn the movie off and you have saved 1 1/2 hours of your life that could be doing something productive.  The story line is about as uneventful as any movie I have seen.  In case you are still interested here's the whole movie in one sentence: Prom Queen grows up leaves small town, becomes semi-successful, Gets married, Gets divorced, Her first love has a baby, she goes back to hometown to get first love back, all her old friends pity her, someone she doesn't even remember from high school gives her a pep talk and she goes back to the big city. All you have to do is add in Melodrama and a lot of alcohol and bam, that's the movie.
B000B8L6LI|3.0|The blade holding device seems to have been made a bit too cheaply. The box arrived a bit banged up but not damaged so I let it slide as the pieces were still good.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I like reading this on my kindle because I can change the size of the type and the line spacing.  I don't know what it would be like if purchased as a book because most people know what they are getting into with Dickens, the trick is to get the literature in a format that is easy for you to read.  This works for me
B007GFDVEE|4.0|I purchased this as a gift for my nephew and he really enjoyed them, overall I would gladly purchase another set for him in the future.

B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Beautiful movie. I love it. It is so wonderful for all of us human to see the side of the life of animals. The whales, the dolphins, Monk Seal, Nene birds, all kind of animals that is out there. we need to be more respectful and putting them ahead of our own needs. I love it so much. it was wonderful movie. strongly recommended for all people and kids. More beneficial to people who are a boater, own a boat, drive a boat, and live on boat. Very educational. help me be caution when I go out to sea.
B007P488YO|5.0|I love it! Clear pictures, great sound, everything I can expect in a bluray. Even the DVD is great! Worth it!

1616550414|5.0|I purchased this because I have been a hardcore Zelda fan for a while now. I love it. Everything is interesting!!! Buy it~ It's inexpensive so I don't see why someone would pass up such a great deal.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is amazing! It installed quickly. It's worth $2.99.  Works great on my kindle fire. When you snap a photo, it immediately saves it to your gallery, which I think is helpful. That way it is easy to keep track of your hairstyles. l love pretending the characters are real people or celebrities, like Nicki Minaj. Love this app! Perfect for any age. Already have made 10 hairstyles and I've only had it for half an hour!

B005LW5J9O|5.0|We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing one another. -Lucretius<br /><br />I finally finished listening to The Swerve and it sang to the last drop. It is truly a wonderful work of scholarship. What is astonishing is that Greenblatt is able to use Lucretius' On the Nature of Things as a kind of window or metaphorical hinge to demonstrate the real difference between the perceptions of the ancient world and those of the modern age. That there is such a perfect example is, perhaps, no accident.<br /><br />The conservative beef with western philosophy, as hijacked by materialists posing as metaphysicians, is that causality is simply reduced to a random aggregate of things that just happen--much as proposed by Lucretius. (I have been railing against this deconstruction of causality for forty years.) Within the group that espouses this view are those who, at the far left end, simply don't believe in any sort of order at all in the universe except a vast, hidden lexicon of attraction and repulsion that has resulted in the largely, illusionary world that we know.<br /><br />At the higher end of this point of view, there are those who believe in an implicit or implicate order (per Bohm [...]) built into matter based on the same rules of repulsion and attraction--just more complex and many layered--but still largely based on random aggregation with a kind of pooled multi-dimensionality. (This is where I derived some of my ideas for cyber-kinetics or the multi-dimensional movements that have also been described in String Theory. Cyber-Kinesis, as described in my book, How to Manage Your D.I.C.K. is the metaphysical analog to superstrings.) Bohm, I suspect, was closeted believer in causality and probably got as close to the truth, in my opinion, as any physicist did in the last century. You can see him having to couch his language very carefully in terms acceptable to the reactionary fringe of his own discipline. He would have most likely enjoyed invoking the taboo word &quot;God&quot; more often in his lectures.<br /><br />I remember reading a doctoral candidate's thesis and being astonished that he didn't seem to advert to the fact that he, like a God, had set up the parameters for the various attractions that he was attempting to demonstrate could be facilitated for automatic assembly. In other words, without his demonstrated setup, assembly would have been unlikely to occur in the same manner. You can't create rules and then jump out of the picture and say you didn't make them.<br /><br />It is quite clear that the universe is not &quot;managed&quot; by God in the sense that Giordano Bruno mocked with his example of the minutae in his own village but by the same token, the vast, lit choirs of being, tier upon magnificent tier, indicates a prior arrangement that most reasonable people would assume is either order implicit in matter, in a way that we don't understand yet, or comes from something like what Aristotle claimed was the Unmoved Mover. Between these extreme points of view, which in reality constitutes the real basis for the moral differences between Republicans and Democrats, lies the truth. There is order, there is purpose in the universe but it cannot be conceived in three or four dimensions. In other words: using a morality or world view based on Newtonian style physics will not provide you with enough data to formulate a response to those who believe morality is purely a matter of convention.<br /><br />Those who believe in causality of the Aristotelian Thomistic blend, for example, cannot believe in abortion or homosexuality as choices that are consonant with nature and causality as it might be commonly understood from that perspective. There are those who would claim that homosexuality illustrates the non-causal nature of reality precisely. In my opinion, preferences, much like the famous accidents of Aristotle are not determinative. In other words, the accident white does not changethe nature of man. A man can be white, black or yellow but he is still a man. Homosexuality is an accidental preference in many instances, a moral adaptation or defect in other instances, equivalent materially to a man born without a limb or sight. And like all defects, it must be adapted to. This is why, as a conservative, I am tolerant of gays but am intolerant in regards to gay marriage or the promotion of defect as an alternative form of normality. Causally speaking, it is a complete disconnect. Accept the view of Lucretius, as embodied in modern relativism and Rorty style deconstruction, and both gay marriage and abortion are simply subjective rules made up by the mutual attraction and repulsion of matter in our heads--nothing more, nothing less.<br /><br />Abortion is an abomination--a complete lack of species loyalty. Whether God exists or doesn't it should be avoided like the plague. It telegraphs a terrible message of irresponsibility and meaning to the younger generation. That being said, the fact that nature terminates 30% of all conceptions, naturally, is an indication that there may be some room here for reasonable disagreement in cases of rape, incest and perhaps gross deformity. As a form of birth control for the lazy it is truly repugnant.<br /><br />One issue that The Swerve indirectly points to is that the nature of God can be construed, by those not interested in academic subtlety, to be the mirror image of matter. Pie in the sky or pie on earth. God creates Himself--is His own cause, or matter always is, always has been and has not been created--just like God. It is, of course, far easier to deny God's existence, when he is visualized as a bearded schoolmaster given to the adjudication of damnation and salvation based on a moral calculus. It is far more difficult to imagine the God of Lao Tzu or the God of Aquinas who IS essentially by being nothing--no-thing.<br /><br />Absolute denial is, perhaps, as pernicious as absolute affirmation. The way of paradox is far more honorable, in other words, than the tiresome razor of Occam.the nature of man. A man can be white, black or yellow but he is still a man.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The only thing I can do is share my thoughts on this trilogy.  The author is genius and this is certainly NOT mommy porn.  It is a romance that describes a successful man that has flaws stemming from childhood.  Enters a young woman that simply completes him.  I've read the series twice and have learned that I read it so fast the first time, that I missed some things.  The character development was incredible and I truly felt like I knew them, I could feel what was being described, the angst, etc.  The book is about sex, and yes there is a lot of it.

0393316041|5.0|This is a great book! The book was in great shape. Shipping was quick. The book itself is really good. I've only read one chapter so far, but it was really good. This book is great even for learning how to write scientific papers without sounding like a stiff shirt. I'm using this for a Research Methods class. Dr. Feynman is so cool in how he inquires everything and is such a rascal in carrying out his experiments and inquiries.
0385535147|2.0|I've read every Grisham novel and was excited when I saw the reviews being posted for this book because I like many were hopeful the real Grisham had returned.  Not so.  The plot is so completely unbelievable, and the characters so one dimensional, that you will kick yourself for reading the entire book.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|After being disappointed by a barrage of remakes in the past few years (The Thing, Red Dawn, Fright Night) I was wary as to how well Karl Urban would be able to portray Dredd, especially after Stallone's &#34;stunning&#34; performance in &#34;Judge Dredd&#34; which was closer to a study of speech therapy than a action movie.<br /><br />After hearing the beginnings of this movie's cult followings I was amazed by nearly every aspect of the film. Urban does a great, deadpan performace never removing his helmet while the female lead was our view into the harsh world of 2100 A.D while not being weak and powerless (instead using her abilities in creative ways to elicit results). Surprisingly good, little cons, overall a keeper and a fun film.

1609611543|2.0|I think the title is very misleading.  When you read the book and find out ALL the foods which are considered to be bad for you, it is a very limited and unrealistic way to eat.  Many healthy vegetables like beans, yams, potatoes, etc are eliminated from your diet.  The information about genetically engineered food products is interesting.  However, I believe most people will have to modify their approach to the recommended diet.  I would not recommend The Wheat Belly book.

B00271SFB6|1.0|Worst 007 ever. I love Daniel Craig, but this movie was boring, drug on and it was predictable. So sad.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|This movie had promise, but ended up being a strange, mashed-together film that felt like two different movie scripts rammed together incoherently. The film starts out as a time-travel, sci-fi flick, slowly building it's premise, and then...bang: a whole new plot about a demonic child who explodes people begins almost out of thin air.<br /><br />My friends and I looked at each other when this second plot began with looks of \\"what the....?\\" The entire \\"child as deranged killer\\" thing just didn't fit the premise of the first half of the film and was somewhat distasteful. I honestly think the writers had written two different versions of the film, and then rammed them together. This film doesn't know if it wants to be a sci-fi film or a horror film, and in trying to be both, it fails.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|This summary of Abraham Lincoln .......a brief glimpse of a man with abilities that made him the right person for the right time. He was and continues to be.....an exceptional person capable of looking beyond the limits of the human condition to its possibilities. The book is exceptional and beyond its historical value....could serve as a treatise, by example, for the best principles of leadership. Perhaps more of our politicians, corporate leaders and citizens should endeavor to understand the man and what his life and work could teach everyone.
B005IQZB14|3.0|My book club read this book, and I looked forward to it, as this title kept coming up on Amazon as a recommended book, based on my previous purchases. In the end, I am really torn about it. I love the fact that it introduced me to the Pacific Crest Trail, and Cheryl's telling of life on the trail captivated me. I enjoyed the writing style, as she definitely has a level mastery for the craft.<br /><br />On the other hand, the narration was completely and totally self-absorbed. Everything revolves around Cheryl in the book. I kept waiting for Cheryl to elevate herself and develop from greater wisdom from her experience, something that should could provide her readers. Alas, nothing like that really happened. She was broken and self-destructive, then she walked most of the length of California and Oregon, mostly alone, and then she wasn't broken or self-destructive any more. That's it. If you are planning to read this book, don't expect much else, expect for maybe a few chuckles.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Of the four books in this series that I have read thus far, this one moved the slowest by far. All though the action and adventure was limited in this book, there was a lot of character development that occurred and that I personally enjoyed. Cersei was on a downward spiral, and time after time I wondered if she was really that blind. At the end I totally felt like she deserved the bed that she had made and that it was time for her to lay in it and pay the price for her sinister ways. The story line with Brienne of Tarth was mechanistically good, simply because the readers got a chance to see what had happened in the world because of the wars and the waste that had been left behind. I'm however still rooting for the Starks, but that's usually cause I like rooting for the underdog and I feel this is them.  Personally I would like to see much more of Bran, Aria, John that make scarce appearances (if at all) in this book. I think their stories are much more interesting to follow. Also, I missed Tyrian in this book, he is also a favorite character. However, I doubt that I'm going to read the next one. Simply because I know that's the last one that is currently available in the series. I'd much rather wait for a few more to be available, before investing so much time in the story.  For now, I'm taking a break, but will return soon if the story continues. As for family friendliness, this series still rates a 1 out of 5 because of content that is inappropriate for youngsters. Please note that this story is written and intended for a mature audience.

1616550414|5.0|'The Legend of Zelda' has impacted my creativity and my imagination since my first introduction with 'Ocarina of Time.' No, I have not been following the series from the beginning, but I was born in 1987 so that's fairly understandable. However, given that I was deprived during my childhood beginnings, I latched onto the series as though I had already been a part of it. Following my introduction to that wonderful game, I began my quest for the search of Hyrule in the real world. I was visualizing events, beings, creatures, and environments but could never achieve full satisfaction. But that was okay, because I had the games to go back to, and I was contented with my world of fantasy. Well, with this book I am one step closer to the world that I have come to cherish so dearly.<br /><br />When I learned that 'Hyrule Historia' was finally going to be released in the United States back in August of 2012 I immediately placed an order to ensure my copy. When time came closer to the release, I relaized that I wouldn't have enough funds at that moment for the money to be withdrawn and had to cancel the order (I would hope that Amazon will eventually allow customers to choose when funds will be extracted). But I have finally been able to reorder the book and  bask in its full glory.<br /><br />There are gratuitous sections of art, both concept and finalized. Within these art sections there are even comments from the designers remarking on what they would like the final product to take. There are storyline bridges between each game in the series regarding the state of Hyrule at any given time. And, naturally, fans can finally see the official timeline of this wonderful fantasy world.<br /><br />For any fan that is considering purchasing the book, I will say that any fan should appreciate it greatly. Some have complained about the 'Skyward Sword' section being too long. I consider this an unfair critique, though, seeing as the book was originally intended as a companion pieceto that game. No matter how much page space is given to any paricular game, the information and art in this book are much, much more than fans already had. To me, that makes the book incredibly valuable.<br /><br />Truly this book is meant for the fans. If, like me, you are looking for more to explore in Hyrule, this will satiate for awhile. 'Hyrule Historia' stands as a shining and fitting result of twenty-five years of artistic contribution, and I would personally thank all responsible if I could.

It works just as well as the other two to charge my cell phone and just as poorly as the other two to charge my Kindle Fire. I now have a plethora of cell phone cables, a library card, and a Kindle that will charge part way sometimes if I jiggle the cable connection long enough to get it to work.

B002DQLGHU|4.0|It is well filmed and the acting is good. I just think that it may convey that kids can do this stuff themselves which I do not agree with. However it is entertaining and the villain is not who you think.

0670023329|5.0|The reviews promised a &#34;can't put down&#34; read, and this book was just that.... hard to wrap your head around the experiences one man can endure, but this book peels back the layers of this man's horrific ordeal, not glossing over or trying to martyrize him while doing so.It's a candid look at the strength of the human spirit, will to survive and moreover a heretofore unseen look at the atrocities perpetrated by the North Korean totalitarian government. I see why this spent time at the top of the best seller lists...
0812984412|3.0|I wanted to see the movie, but decided to read the book first.  I found it confusing and lost interest early in the book. My friend is going to give it a try.

B009POCFTG|4.0|The movie is about a young man who's a drug dealer, has the drugs he supposed to sell stolen from what we believe to be his mother, fact later dictate it might not be true, but the audience never knows.  Anyway the drug dealer finds out there's a 50,000 dollar life insurance policy for his mother that's left in his sisters name.  He then plots with his dad, who's now remarried, his Wife and the sister to kill his mother, The hear of this detective/hitman Joe.  They try to hire him but there's a problem they can't pay Joe the money for the hit because they need the mom to be dead to collect the money.  So Joe whose taken with the virginal innocent sister, takes her as collateral in all the terms imaginable.<br /><br />Some of the problems for me is we never really meet the mother's boyfriend, I felt if we met him it would have filled in a gap in storytelling that's left open.  The movie ends at the climax, like when the movie enters the climax it just stops and cuts to black, it right at a powerful scene when a character is at their breaking point.  The first scenes fill fake as we get used to the characters and just how dumb they are, but after a couple minutes they had me convinced. The last scene of the movie which is like thirty minutes long is so good and intense it was hard to turn away, even though you want to.<br /><br />The movie has great performances all around, the stand outs being Gina Gerhon, Matthew McConaughey and Juno Temple.  The rest of the cast does fine but seems to be playing catch up, when they're around.<br /><br />The comedy of the film is in how shallow and stupid the main characters are, and how the southern pleasantries are mixed into these intense scenes.  I laughed at how absurd everything is like the drug kingpin telling him how much he likes him, but you don't have my money so I'm about to beat the crap out of you but I do really like you, remember that.  I laughed out loud twice once during that scene and one other.<br /><br />The movie was originally released as NC-17 I don't know if I'm just used to HBO shows like True Blood, and Game of Thrones, or other show like Dexter and Spartacus, but nothing seemed all that extreme. There one intense scene where someone in forced to do an act which makes you feel pretty disgusting, yet can't turn away.  There is a couple of bush shots, and one's a close up in  a scene that's meant for shock value, and there are various boobs through out.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie for lovers of dark dark comedy, people who loved the movie Funny Games,  People that want to see Matthew McConaughey step out of his just a charming guy thing, not to say he's not charming in this he is but his character is the devil and uses his charm as a weapon.ie was originally released as NC-17 I don't know if I'm just used to HBO shows like True Blood, and Game of Thrones, or other show like Dexter and Spartacus, but nothing seemed all that extreme.

B00008J2PG|5.0|This film, set in Nazi-occupied Rome during World War II, depicts the efforts of a remarkable member of the Vatican staff, Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty, and, to a lesser extent, sheds some much needed light on the actions of the Pope during that war.  It would be a great film even if it weren't true, but, in this case, it is just that.  Gregory Peck portrays Monsignor O'Flaherty; Christopher Plummer, Colonel Kappler, the Gestapo Chief in Rome; and Gielgud, Pope Pius XII.<br /><br />In has long been Catholic policy to give sanctuary to those in eminent danger, and such was the case in Italy and in Nazi-occupied Rome during WWII.  The Vatican State was, of course, in a precarious position; surrounded by the Nazis it could offer no resistance if Hitler decided to invade.  The Pope, then, had to walk a fine line of neutrality; while, at the same time, hundreds of escaped British soldiers and downed-American and Allied airmen, along with hundreds of Jews and various other resistance fighters and refugees, were attempting to evade capture in hopes of gaining Vatican sanctuary.<br /><br />The plot of this film, then, revolves around Monsignor O'Flaherty's attempts to finance, organize, and maintain a secret group dedicated to finding safe havens for these hunted men while, at the same time, the Gestapo was doing everything in its power to root them out and punish those who sheltered them.  This makes for a very compelling film well worth watching.<br /><br />Some points of interest: At war's end, it was estimated that at the time of Rome's liberation O'Flaherty and his confederates were hiding over 6,500 people.  For his efforts, Monsignor O'Flaherty was subsequently made a `Commander of the British Empire' and was awarded the Medal of Freedom by the United States.  He died on October 30, 1963, at which time he was mourned throughout the world.

B0000026W0|5.0|If you like Asia(the band), you might like Toto(the band). Although not quite as loud as say &#34;Heat of the Moment&#34; by Asia, Toto has multiple hits like &#34;Rosanna(light rock personified)&#34;, &#34;Hold the Line(slightly harder than their other stuff)&#34;, and &#34;Africa(a light rock station all-time favorite)&#34;. Although not nearly as hard rock as most 80's rock bands(Poison, Whitesnake, etc.), if you like a kinder, gentler form of rock, Toto is your best band choice.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I bought the Kindle version of this novel when it first came out, LONG AGO, and it is STILL on the bookshelves (virtual and actual alike)!  The book was very well written and reminded me of a long ago Agatha Christie (boy, does that date me!) when you were in suspense to the very end.  However, this seems to be a one time shot with this author - her other novels are not that great...............

030758836X|5.0|I was looking forward to reading this book because so many people have loved it.  I was not disappointed for the most part!  The twists and turns in the books were great and ones that I didn't see coming.  My only hang up on this book was for the hype that it does have I didn't understand why the ending wasn't more.  It felt almost unfinished but in a way it sort of worked.  This is a quick read though as you are always wanting to know what will happen in the next chapter and if he did kill his wife!<br /><br />This is a great crime novel that I could see becoming a good movie at some point because of the hype it does rightfully have.  Even if you aren't into that crime who-done-it sort of novel it also has a thriller element that you might enjoy.

Because of the activity light, I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.

B006TVQTHW|5.0|Well made and thought out  case, perfect for high density storage and high performance graphics machines.  With this 2nd generation Antec Three Hundred they have rotated the drive bays 90 degrees so the drives pull out perpendicular to the mother board eliminating the problem of hitting cables and cards during drive changes.  I do have one issue in that there is very little room for the SATA cables at the end of the drives and the side panel.  Right angle SATA cables work well however right angle power connectors are not on the power supplies I usually install.  Overall the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.  So really 4.5 stars.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I've wanted to read this book for a while. After hearing of  his death  I made it a priority. What a hero and man of valor. His story touched me.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is good enough to read twice - - and I have done so!  The author presents his story honestly and clearly.  One sympathizes with his struggle to find words to describe his near-death experience, which was quite ethereal and mystical.  Yet his medical background lend credence to his story, making it more believable than other NDE's.

As a semi-young (28) mother I always felt connected to the tween and teen cancer and bone marrow transplant patients that we got to know while living in the hospital.<br /><br />This book allowed me to really understand a lot of the real life issues teen cancer patients, especialyl terminal patients, experience. I am so thankful that this book allowed me to further connect, and minister to, such a determined, special, and amazing group of people.

Also could use a spot on the Wii U's nintendo e-shop you know being in HD and all.

I wish that I could take things that have been said over and over before and write it up and sell it, and get people to give me 5 star ratings.  I should have added; Basically it's the same principle as behind a vision board without the board. It's just concentrating on what you want with no negativity. Her first experiment is asking for a gift or blessing within the next 48 hours and to have that blessing recognized as such.  How here hasn't been asking for things, praying for things, all their life? Reading her book will somehow cause you to actually finally get what you pray for.... in 48 hours.

At first, he would say the sound that each animal makes when he opened the flap (except for the camel, because I don't *know* what sound they make!), and now he's graduated to naming each animal as he reveals it.<br /><br />The flaps are nice and sturdy, and he hasn't pulled any of them off.The crate doors for the animals (which are the flaps), open in different ways: some lift from the bottom, some from the side, some open in the middle, so it makes the kids do a little bit of problem solving.<br /><br />The best part of this, and any book you read with your toddler, is how you bring it to life. When we get to the page with the lion (which they send back because he is TOO FIERCE!), I'll say &#34;Roar!&#34; and tickle my son. He loves that part and anticipates it with giggles whenever we reach that page. Definitely get this book, and have fun reading it with your little one!
B007SGM084|5.0|I read all three in less than a week! I enjoyed the unfolding of the tales! I recommend these stories to anyone wanting to be entertained and captivated.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Fun game, hours of entertainment with free puzzles. I wish I could put my own images in puzzles though. Great interface and easy to use. The paid puzzle packs are nice too, but for paying I wish there were more puzzle images than there are. The resolutions oh the photos are kind of low quality over all, compared to playing the HD version hard to focus at times. Still great app, looking forward to more!
B002JVWR9U|3.0|I love everything supernatural, so I try to collect everything that it has to do with that. this season is good, but the only problem is that, back then when I purchase this item, I din't know I could return it if it was damage, now I know that. the season was freezing like in two disks. but the story it self is wonderful.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|This is the second book have read from this author and I love the simple witty love story sometimes I need a break from all the sci-fi books and need the happy ending
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I am glad I got all my seasons of Charmed. Because I love Charmed, is Funny, Witchy, and of course very entertaining!!!! LOVED IT.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Cool and good for all kids 4 and up. The effect is really epic. The train is risky but if you have good skill.<br /><br />,
1401917186|5.0|This book is very interesting, I learned a lot from this book, There is so many things that we really don't understand, but this book gives you, an inside understanding of what this is and it means. Thank you.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I purchased this phone case for my iPhone 4s knowingly for underwater use.  I used this case underwater for 3 days and had no problems.  I snorkled with stingrays & fish the first day for 3 hours.  The phone was either in my hand or wet suit underwater.  The second day we swam with dolphins and also had success with the case.  Third day took the case to a water park down countless slides and tube rides.  I found the case durable and did everything the company claimed it would do.  My phone buttons worked fine when in the case.  I will state it is very important to watch the youtube videos regarding installation of the phone so you don't rip or warp the rubber gasket for the bottom speaker.  I was so happy with this case and the incredible video I was able to take with it, that I bought one for my in-laws who love undersea adventures as well.  I have read the negative reviews and it sounds to me like the installation went wrong somewhere.  Instructions do not.come with the case, but they are on the website and all over youtube.  And like any product that is mass produced, there is probably some defective product out there.  If you perform the water test without your phone in the case like the company directs you to, then you should know right away if the case has problems or not.  And yes, I did test it for the recommended hour. I did have a slight decrease in speaker sound when talking on the phone, but it wasn't bad.  I highly recommend giving this case a shot.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great game!  I actually purchased the entire game.  It kept me locked in wondering what was going to happen next.

B0083Z614S|4.0|As with any good children's literature, The Secret Garden is easy enough to read at a young age and is meaningful enough to engage adult readers. The themes are universally relevant, as the book engages mostly with the question of what it means to be alive.
B005XLN97M|5.0|muy bien por este vendedor el equipo e llego sin novedad a mi destino y funciona bien  sin nigun tipo de detalle
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it and it's fun, I just wish you didn't have to have so many jewels to buy items<br /><br />it can take away from the game.
B000VHVGM8|1.0|didn't like it never finished it so bad i probably should return it I will have to call tomorrow during the day
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 4 year old enjoys playing this game.<br />it is really fun if you like horses. just what he wanted.
B007S3S8HO|2.0|I got this set about 2 weeks ago and It was somewhat confusing to put together. the platform is very unstable and it is hard to place the king pig on the tiny car that is half its size. It is very flimsy and hard to build with big hands. Over all I think that it is a wast of money.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Such a fun game for kids and adults alike.  The graphics r good and its very additictive to play. Fun for all!
1451648537|5.0|Fascinating story about  a man whose creative genius has had a significant impact in all our lives.<br />Isaacson allows us to know the man in all of his complexities while giving us the history of the most important product development/and culture change catalyst of our time.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Nice job, Mr. Weir. Of course, I'm biased, I have NASA to thank for Kennedy Space Center and providing mine and my wife's parents with jobs.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Great sound of violin, dubstep and other eletronic music. I would recommend it to anyone into that type of music.
B009GESJH2|5.0|if you like anything about Kid Rock you will like this CD.  not his best and far from his worst.
B007H1HQW0|3.0|It's O.K.,,, trouble getting it together,, not quite what i expected,, this pretty well covers it,, dont have 4 more words to comment.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Got into the series on HBO from the get go and heard the book was even better. Turns out their equally as good. Surprisingly, the series follows the book quite closely, with very little deviation and only a few details left out. Looking forward to starting book 2!
0446581356|5.0|I just recieved the book last night and im already in love couldnt stop reading i was up way pass my bed time reading this book!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app its very addicting, sometimes it does not open as it should but I'm not sure if that's my kindle or not but i like the little games an the compititions are fun to complete and I lol at some of the hair styles you can give your horse over all I'd pay for this app but happy it was free :)
0446580848|3.0|Demille's John Corey is the reason I write, period.  I read Plum Island and started writing and never stopped.  But I feel like Nelson Demille sometimes is more worried about deadlines than writing his best material.  As much as I liked the great wit riddled throughout, I had to skim many times because I felt locked in like I was stuck in the same room for too long.  Like I could skip 50 pages and still not miss anything.  I'm still a huge fan but I don't think this had the guts that Plum Island, Spencerville, The Gate House, or The Bookcase did.
B00AFEY354|5.0|My kids recommended I watch this movie. They first had me read the book and the movie was very good as well. It is a great show with a fun plot. It is one that I'm people can relate too and understand others.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I like Percy Jackson,Battle of the Labyrinth because it's an interesting adventure story about how Percy explores the magical tunnel of the labyrinth.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I don't use this much because I carry my Kindle with me but when I do use it it works perfectly!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't play it myself but the kids love it! On the days they can't get outside the kids get together and play it for hours!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love The Big Bang Theory! So funny! Season 5 was my favorite season so far!  I can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD.
0786955570|4.0|My son really liked playing this game with me. Its &#34;cooperative&#34; play, so players are basically challenging the dungeon scenario and not each other.<br /><br />The game is complex, but not so complex that my 10 year old didn't get it with my grown up guidance.<br /><br />Some elements of the rules require some thought, and common sense approach. A visit to the developers website has additional scenarios for free you can download.<br /><br />The game does not allow for easy victory. There were a couple of cliffhanger &#34;endings&#34; where we thought we had it locked up, only to lose! Actually, that makes it a fantastic game! You have to work to win it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game I very very addictive and almost impossible to put down.I find myself playing at 3 am and tired at work the next day .
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have I have been an Apple fan boy since I held my first iPod.  After reading this book, I understand how Apple has made it to where it is today.<br /><br />Steve Jobs left a great deal to be Desiree in the husband and father department, but I am very much inspired by his intense focus on what he felt in his heart was the right thing for the products he was creating.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|My heart struggled so much in this movie. It blew me away. I watched it once on netflix and it stayed with me for months in my head, so i broke down and bought it from amazon and will never regret it.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I grew up reading these books and couldn't wait to see this. Disney couldn't have screwed up the promotion of this any more and didn't do itself any favors with the release of the DVD. The movie itself is outstanding. I even liked the minor modifications to the story better than the original story line. Special effects were outstanding.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I liked it, there were times when it was more ok but overall it was a good movie. I can see myself watching it again
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|the  cable works exactly the way it is supposed to work. When my kindle fire gets low, I plug it in for the night  and by morning it's  ready to use.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I had to watch this out of loyalty and it was cute and it did last long in my mind.
B005LAIHCW|2.0|This movie wasn't what I expected. The start was slow and I didn't like the way it ended. it wasn't really alot of jaw dropping off of your seat kind of movie as I wanted.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I love it because it was cute, very imaginative and adventure filled. I thought it was going to be a bit more childish, but it exceeded my expectations when it unfolded a true, but sad story that has happened and probably will happen again. Not that exact story, but the fat that fear pushed man to terrible and unspeakable things.
B009XTF8JM|3.0|this movie was okay, a good start and the ending was very good, the middle was very believable and it leaves room for a part II if there was one to come out.
B004QMW1NM|5.0|Got this album for &#34;Young Blood&#34; which I heard on an episode of Chuck.  Originally I was going to just buy the single, but I heard a few other tracks and was convinced to buy the album, which has turned out great.<br />This is well-written, melodic electronic music with no harshness or overwhelming bass line.  The female vocalist has a pleasant voice, the lyrics are better than the throwaway trash in too much popular music, and the track assortment and arrangement for this album are quite nice.  Punching In A Dream, The Sun, Eyes, No Way....the first half of the album is good fun, and quite energetic.  The second half gets slightly more serious, but never so much so as to feel forced or out of place.  I can see why this New Zealand band has won so many awards recently.<br />As previous posters said, if you like Passion Pit, Snow Patrol, Stars, M83, or anything with origins in synthpop or post-punk, you should get this album, and then keep an eye out for what's next for this band.
B007C3TVNA|2.0|I didn't like this movie at all. If you are not watching this movie closely you can get confused on what the plot is about. it could have been produced better.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a very handy app when the in-text dictionary on the Kindle is unable to provide a definition, e.g. ball peen hammer.  You simply type in the desired word and you are also given a link to Wikipedia for further information and possibly a picture (which in my example was very helpful) .
B008JFUUIA|5.0|We bought the movie at Christmas and I've watched it now 32 times... and the the ending still gives me goose bumps eact time I watch it.  If you don't \\"get music\\" or it's not part of your soul... and watch this movie for the jokes, you will rate the movie low (witness and read the one star reviews).  But for those of us who can really appreciate a good remix and/or cover, this movie simply rocks!  Skylar Astin steals the show by being a truly outstanding singer.  Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, and Rebel Wilson are fine singers too, as are many of those uncredited. Watch the material that didn't make the final cut. You will better understand some of the obvious missing details.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have found this app to be the best sleep aid. I suffer trim tinnitis and the ringing in my ears makes it very difficult to fall asleep. I love the sound of an air conditioned or fan because it helps to counteract the distraction of the ringing,  but running a fan in the winter or when travelling is not practical. This app is fantastic. I have also found that the purring cat sound is quite soothing when I have a severe headache.I use this app every night and the alarm feature bakes sure I awaken on time after a great night 's rest.
B0000DKMK0|5.0|Vol. 1 is a great movie by itself, but this Director's Cut version is almost perfect. It doesn't have a lot of extra footage or anything, but the &#34;Showdown at House of Blue Leaves&#34; scene is worth buying it... 100% Tarantino
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|It was a great movie.  The entire family watched it and my niece watched it several times, as that is how good it was.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|I loved the movie. It kept me interested through out the movie.  Shows how one person could make a difference on another persons life.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love this game. It's  really fun! Sometimes it's challenging but that makes it more fun.I recommend this app for all ages. It's really fun!
B005DOJ68K|5.0|What more can be said this is CCR. If you are a fan of their music you will love this album.
B007V65R54|5.0|For anyone with slightest interest in why we sometimes get it right when making predictions (from weather forecasts, over sports results to more serious events such as earthquakes), but many times not...read Nate Silvers book. Gives great insights to the psychology of making predictions, and the math behind it all, in a simple to understand way.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|First can I say that I am glad that there are movies out there for children who aren't necessarily into lovey dovey princesses, Unicorns, and traditional fairytales! My children and I enjoyed it and I wouldn't mind seeing it over and over again being that it is not filled with the sappy songs from other children's movies. I can relate to it having grown up with a very overprotective albeit loving father, and I can understand from a parents point of view of only wanting your children to be safe. Kids are going to grow and you got to let them live. This movie is for children of all ages who love to laugh!
B0063IH60K|5.0|THIS IS YOUR NORMAL SOLITAIRE GAME FUN TO PLAY<br />JUST WISH THERE WERE MORE GAMES ON THIS ONE AND BESIDES THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY CHEAT ON THIS SOLITAIRE
1439102813|5.0|A rivetting novel based on true facts. A page turner which you cannot abandon for a whole day.  Unfortunately, partway through this book you wonder if you, too, have early onset Alzheimers.
B0086700CM|4.0|its a good game to play at the bus stop when your bus is running late or you're bored at home with nothing to do
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I love the way this case turns my kindle on and off.  The only fault I have is having to leave the case open when charging my kindle.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It is an entertaining story as all of his books are. It would probably make a good movie. I liked it.
B0006Z2KX4|4.0|This is not a review of the movie, as this is not only one of my favorite comedies of all time, but one of AFI's top 100 movies of all time. There's no need add my two cents of opinion.<br /><br />However, as to the product itself, the print quality seems a bit of a disappointment. I had once read that the National Film Registry for Preservation had selected 'Bringing Up Baby' for preservation, which normally includes renewal of the master. I highly doubt that this is a print from such a master, despite the DVD set's \\"remastered\\" claim. Perhaps we'll just have to wait for a Blu-ray version.<br /><br />This set is actually very good, with featurettes on Howard Hawks, Cary Grant, etc. And it is, actually, the best print available on DVD at present.
1607053551|4.0|So stoked about this book.  Great practical information and images that leave me inspired.  Cannot wait to put to use!
