B005LAIGW8|2.0|The first Ghost Rider was pretty bad, but surely you can't get any worse, right guys?  ...I should really stop asking stupid questions like that: of course it could be worse!  Aliens vs. Predator Requiem proved their can be a worse film than Alien vs. Predator and so now we have Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.  Although, I will say, as bad as it is, as someone who enjoys seeing Nicolas Cage unleashed this movie was more entertaining than the first Ghost Rider (more entertaining in this case =/= \\"better\\").<br /><br />Right off the bat we're thrust into the story.  A French, gun wielding priest (played so over the top by Idris Elba it reaches hilarity) is in search of a boy who is to be the vessel of the Devil.  They enlist the Ghost Rider (who has moved to Europe since the first film) to help protect him.  Along the way they must fight thugs, cultists, and a villain endowed with the powers of decay.<br /><br />Sound interesting to you?  No?  Let's be honest: No one actually cares about the plot of this movie.  Anyone going into this movie only really wants to see a biker with a flaming skull for a head beat around baddies for 90 minutes.  Something that was  NOT satisfied in 2007's Ghost Rider.<br /><br />You may remember that the first Ghost Rider seemed to spend more of its budget of shots of Ghost Rider randomly destroying public property than actually fighting the bad guys.  Going into this I was thinking \\"If Ghost Rider is actually fighting bad guys the whole time this might be more enjoyable.\\"  Well, he certainly fights more<br /><br />Within the first two minutes Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance makes it clear that the action will be shot with the most deplorable use of shaky cam outside of a found-footage film.  The action is incomprehensible most of this movie and is highlighted by random bits of hilarity (such as the Rider spinning around slowly in mid-air for no apparent reason).  Ghost Rider converting a giant earth mover into a giant flaming buzz saw is the best action visual in the film, but inspiration like that only strikes the filmmakers a single time and they gave it away in the ads.  Towards the end there is a chaser sequence where Ghost Rider commandeers a truck and I swore they were about to do a tribute to the famous chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it went absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />How about Ghost Rider himself? To be honest, I like the grimy, dirty look Ghost Rider has in this film.  While technically the special effects aren't as good (Spirit of Vengeance has about half the budget of the first film) I much prefer the look of this Ghost Rider.  He looks burnt, he looks like something that came from the pits of hell.  He may not look as iconic as the traditional design used in the first film, but I feel this is a better look for a live action Ghost Rider.<br /><br />This time out Nicolas Cage is off the hook, and when you let him off his chain he typically turns in enjoyable (see: crazy) performances.  If you're a filmmaker and you have Nic Cage in your movie it is a disservice to the viewers if you aren't allowing him to go all out.  Especially in something as bad as Spirit of Vengeance.  If you entered this movie because you heard Nicolas Cage was doing motion capture for Ghost Rider and \\"based his performance off a cobra\\" then Cage does not disappoint.<br /><br />However the transformation scenes are not improved.  In fact I'd say the transformation sequences are hilarious and seem reminiscent of the special effects found in The Mask.  It is incredibly goofy and not the least bit frightening.  You could say that they're trying to capture some insanity with the character, but even then its more silly than \\"crazy\\".<br /><br />Nothing really worth talking about once we get past Cage.  Aside from the over the top performance of Idris Elba no one else in this film is really worth mentioning.<br /><br />Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a bad movie.  The characters are absurd, Cage and Elba are the only ones who seem to be enjoying themselves, the plot is derivative, and if you're a fan of the comics .  It is worse than the 2007 film on every critical level...but I will admit, in a guilty pleasure sort of way Spirit of Vengeance is a more entertaining film due to its own stupidity.  The first Ghost Rider was boring.  At least this one had me constantly gawking at how silly it could get.<br /><br />So there you have it.  If you're looking for silly movie to watch with some friends, or are just into seeing Nicolas Cage freak out on screen you'll probably get a kick out of seeing this.  While I admit I was entertained by its absurdity I can't bring myself to score this movie any higher.  Its undeniably a poorly made, forgettable film, but if you're into this sort of bad film than it wouldn't hurt to rent Spirit of Vengeance.re the only ones who seem to be enjoying themselves, the plot is derivative, and if you're a fan of the comics .

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was addicted just from the few chapters the sample let me read and also I watched the movie first. Knowing of course books are always better than than the movies and this book series was no exception in my eyes. It was beautifully written so much that I felt what Katnis felt could feel Peeta and Gale's heart break and love for her. Of course I had a favorite which is Gale but quickly realized Peeta would be the one in the end. I even cried when Prim, so innocent and beautiful and smart was killed by the rebels. I felt the heart wrentching pain Katniss felt (my own sister died). I am a big bookworm and always mope around at the end of a book but these had me locked into another world almost I am so sad that it ended thay it didnt last long enough (but of course i read all three books in my recent weekend off). To all of those that are hesitant about reading due to the movie or the few bad reviews please ignore it and get these books and as soon as you begin reading you will be in District 12 right next to Katniss and her friends and family.

B000274THQ|5.0|I came across the super comedy a number of years ago when I was staying in Germany. I have a number of friends from Rostock Eastern Germany and as a lecturer in International Relations in the USA, have talked endlessly about life in the former Warsaw Pact countries with Czech, Polish and German friends. This film looks at the collapse of the GDR from one family's perspective in a way that mirrors what I was told happened by my friends.<br /><br />The plot is simple but intriguing. It begins in the closing days of the GDR. The narrative is given by Alexander (Daniel Bruhl), who is an unhappy young man living in a claustrophobic system, which he feels is oppressing him. He lives with his mother, a devout communist since her husband fled to the West and sister in a small communist flat in East Berlin. Alexander is involved in a demonstration and gets arrested in front of his mother. The shock of his arrest brings on a heart attack which leaves her in a comma for a number of months. Whilst the mother is in the comma the GDR collapses, the wall comes down, western goods and eventually money flood into the East, the sister finds a West German boyfriend, the family flat gets a western make over and many peoples lives change. When the mother awakens, the doctors are afraid a shock may kill her, so being a devout communist and fearing finding out there is no GDR any more, Alexander decides to keep what has happened secret from his mother, with hysterical consequences.<br /><br />Whilst the film is humorous it is also quite a sad and reflective film. It shows that not everything changed for the best and all things western had their personal and societal costs. The tension between East and West Germans, which I felt when I lived in Wurzburg in 1990 and Luneburg in 1992, comes across brilliantly. The characterisations used in the film are all sublime. The cost to East German society is left wide open so all can see in terms of, unemployment, alcoholism and the consequences for the family of an escapee to the West. I actually use this film in my USA International Relations classes, to show students that not everything was bad behind the Iron Curtain and that there was a severe societal cost to the wall coming down and the westernisation process.<br /><br />I think this film is sublime representation on life in an Eastern Bloc country and how the country changed due to westernisation. It is a comedy but it also shows the negative side to all the changes that happened in 1989 and 1990. I think this is the best German comedy I have seen in many years. My version had great English subtitles.<br /><br />Highly recommended.the family of an escapee to the West.

B00CATSONE|4.0|Short and to the point. Fun for a quick pick me up type of story that gets you thinking about your own abilities.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|I am a great fan of Enigma. Probably like most Enigma fans I first listened to the band by purchasing MCMXC AD, which I think is their very best album. Seven Lives Seven Faces comes very close to topping the aforementioned album with its rhythmic beats and distant tones of MCMXC. As with all Enigma albums there is a mixture of music, melodies and vocals which in this album blend to make superb atmospheric music. Each track is different from anything else on the album, which is sometimes the downside to Enigma, as some albums sound similar to other Enigma albums or similar to the other tracks on a particular album.<br /><br />Whilst this is still not as good as MCMXC, which for me is still the best Enigma album, this CD comes a very close second. It is obvious from listening to it that it is Enigma, but there are few throwbacks to other albums, which has been a problem with some other Engima CD's recently. I highly recommend this CD to any Enigma fan who is looking for a refreshingly new Enigma album. Great atmospheric music, Enigma back to its best. Highly recommended.
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|Best transfer of this film to dvd. Sharp, clear, clean. Much better than I expected. And the story is great, too!
0143120530|4.0|I have read 1000's of books on the subject of success, law of attraction, motivation, mind mapping, memory and wealth creation. I have been a business consultant and motivational coach for a number of years. As such I have read many good and extremely poor books in these subject matters.<br /><br />I was sent this book as a part of the Amazon Vine programme and I thought it would be a self help book along the lines of the Einstein Factor or the plethora of Tony Buzan, Edward De Bono books on mind and memory. What this book is, is a memoir of a journalist who observed the US memory championships and what he learnt from it. If you are looking for a straight talking self help book, that will give you many new strategies to improve your memory, this is not the book for you. I found it quite a difficult read, as I did not want an autobiography, but a practical book with ideas that are well laid out and that I could use now. The advice and observations are intermingled with prose and you can get bogged down with the detail.<br /><br />If you are looking for an autobiography, with suggestions on how to improve memory, then this book will suit you down to the ground. If like me you are looking for a self help book with instant strategies, you will not necessarily find this type of book engaging. In all honesty I did not read the entire book, after I had realised what it was. I ended up speed reading it to find the few useful memory nuggets, contained within the text.<br /><br />The book makes a good biography, but it lacks many things if you buy it as a self help book for improving your memory. There are better books on the market if you want that type of publication.<br /><br />Recommended as an interesting auto biography.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Expected so much more from this book. Too many stories going at once with a thin plot line. Really one of the worst books I have ever read. Considering that the Harry Potter books were some of the most enjoyable.
B000E1ZBFY|4.0|I bought this film as I wished to know more about Pope John Paul 2nd. In 1993 to 1995 I lived in Lublin, Poland, where the Karol once worked. Many people spoke with great affection about the man, who would one day become Pope. Seeing this film on DVD I was intrigued with who and what made this man.<br /><br />The film is 3 hours long. It is a great biopic of the man, but I feel it dwells too much on his early life in the war. Over 1 hour is spent on this period and only 10 minutes on him becoming Pope. I would have liked a little more about his Papal election. This election was controversial, yet is passed over very quickly. There is no analysis of why he was chosen or the Geo Political earthquake his election help create. I also think some more analysis of the time he was Arch Bishop of Nova Hoota would have been appropriate. For many Poles the period he spent negotiating and building this Church against State opposition is what made him a legend in Poland, long before he was elected Pope.<br /><br />It is also obvious that this is a made for TV film, and does suffer from some very poor special effects.<br /><br />If you accept the short comings of this film and just enjoy learning something about this GREAT man, then the film is worth watching. With better editing and some greater focus on the two highlighted areas, I feel it would have warranted 5 stars.<br /><br />Great film, but lacks some focus in two important areas.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|very entertaining and great different characters.  I now want to go to india just to visit not to live.  so worth watching
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This film is based upon the actual events of the bombing of Pearl Harbour. Very often with American war films, they glorify the USA and demean others. This film in essence shows all, as it was.<br /><br />It highlights the catalogue of errors on the US side that led to a \\"Turkey Shoot\\" in the harbour. It shows briefly the mistakes on the Japanese side. Overall the film is as true a record of the events leading up to this tragedy as Hollywood could create. The special effects are very good for the age of the picture. Overall it is a great cinematic triumph of fact over Hollywood romanticism, as followed in the later Pearl Harbour.<br /><br />For any fanatic of war films, or as a historical document, this film ticks most, if not all the boxes. Great film based on sad events.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|If you have not played either game, anyone can still appreciate this incredible score that follows the game's story. Truly amazing composition and sounds that you have never heard before that are organic and mechanical at the same time.
B000FS9SBY|5.0|What can I say about this film?<br /><br />There are not enough superlatives to describe this wonderfully atmospheric, romantic, lost love, period film. The plot is straightforward. In a small 1940's village in Southern Italy, a small boy becomes obsessed with the local cinema. He does everything he can to go there and watch films but more importantly learn how the projection room works. Over time he learns from the old projectionist how the antiquated machines work and through this, a friendship begins between the old man and the young boy. Intermingled in the story are some wonderful comedic scenes looking at what was also happening in the cinema whilst a film was showing. By accident there is a fire and the small boy has to take over the running of the cinema. Through the passage of time from a junior through to adolescence the audience is shown a sweet love story full of pathos between the teenager and his first love. The story is beautifully shot and told. The young projectionist eventually grows up and leaves the village to go to Rome and learn cinematography.<br /><br />The original film then shows the return of the now grown up famous film director going back to the village for the funeral of the old projectionist. The Directors cut makes the ending of the film completely different than the cinema released version. It is quite amazing how the two films differ so dramatically, as in the Directors cut the now famous film director goes in search of his first love from many years ago.<br /><br />It is a beautifully shot film, full of pathos and atmosphere. The friendship between the young boy and the old projectionist is beautifully crafted so that it feels real. The script lifts you up and then fills you full of sadness towards the main characters, it is a real emotional roller-coaster of a film. My own preference is for the original cinema released ending, rather than the Directors cut. This version adds quite considerably to the timing of the film and makes the ending not quite as pleasant. I suppose you have to watch the film and then decide which ending you prefer.<br /><br />This film is beautifully shot with a wonderful bitter sweet story, of what life was like in a Southern Italian village just after the second world war and what it is like for a successful person to go back to, a village, his past and his memories from a time of his life that could never be repeated. The film deserved more than the one Oscar it received. I cannot recommend this film enough, a beautiful story wonderfully shot with a fantastic script and incredible direction.<br /><br />Brilliant!

B004LWZW4W|5.0|Saw it in the theater, and loved the story line about a guy who loves his father and tries to find a cure for Alzheimer's.  For me, that was the underlying theme.  But it also demonstrates the compassion he had for the lab animals and their loyalty to him in return.  I have re-watched this movie several times and I still think it is one of the best I have ever seen.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|I have laughed for weeks recalling the one liners in this adorable movie.  I'm always skeptical of sequels but Despicable Me 2 pulled it off.  There is a LOT of innuendo for the adults watching it but if you get Steve Carrell's humor you'll be rolling in the aisles.  My husband and I were laughing as much as the kids through this movie and can't wait for it to come out on Blu Ray.  It's absolutely adorable and well worth the investment.  If anyone knows where to buy a nacho chip hat, please let me know.

1939416019|2.0|I became interested in this book based on reviews I read on Amazon.  Unfortunately, this book is absolutely devoid of both plot and character development.  One review placed this book on the level of the series A Song of Ice and Fire; that is unfortunate and unrealistic.  I will give most books a chance, but this one cannot stand upon its inadequate and rather childish storyline.  I believe the story could, perhaps, be redeemed by fleshing out many areas, but of course that was not the case.  Instead, we are left with a bizarre story, in which we are asked to connect with Thor because he just doesn't feel life is fair - what a redeeming characteristic.  I bought the book on Kindle for $3, and for a $3 story, you get what you pay for.  Don't pay full price for this short story wishing to be an epic novel.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Had waited a long time to watch this series--was so excited that it was already a feature of my Amazon Prime!  So, basically, I was already paying for the Amazon Prime video streaming feature, but hadn't been using it.  Summer can be slow sometimes when a person wants to watch something on television, but too lazy to go to the video store, or doesn't want to commit a couple of hours to watching a movie...so finding a new series on Amazon Prime is the perfect fit.  We just finished season 2 of Downton Abbey and are ready to gobble up season 3.  My husband became less enchanted with it during the second season because he felt it had lost more of its humorous touches and increased the more dramatically serious aspects.  He is probably right.  But they are doing enough things right that it still has great appeal for me.  When I think of my favorite US programs, only two are as good in quality.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This was very intriguing with all its twists and turns.  The ending was a surprise and nothing I could predict.

0618871713|1.0|How are graphic PORNOGRAPHIC pictures of two lesbians 'eating each other out' considered to be of any legitimate literary value to College of Charleston students!  This book is vulgar and disgusting!
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Probably the 10th time I've seen this but I needed a laugh and I got it again. CLASSIC HUMOR.5 stars 10 times
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|It only gave you help for certain levels.  I am way passed the levels they gave help for.  So it really did not help me
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I enjoyed the puzzle game especially the chapter format.  Some of th  puzzles were a little too simple,like the sequencing game but the challenging round about made up for it.  I will probably get the sequel.
0739321005|5.0|I am so happy I purchased this audiobook. I especially like that it is narrated by the President. Whether you like him or not, it was nice to hear about his life in his own words far before he became a politician.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|This is definitely not what I expected.  I love this story, but this &#34;artistic&#34; take on the story took me someplace that I did not want to go.
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|Discovering new powers seems special for our protagonist, but with the thrill of discovery comes not only the pleasing ones, but in them he also uncovers evil never before encountered.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|If you're into fantasy, this is great.  Think Alice in Wonderland with a few more adult themes and scarey bits.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is amazing just get it.no problems with it works amazing and is super fun..just get it!you will not regret it.CAUTION highly addictive!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun don't like how you have to buy everything nowadays. Addicting and definitely worth the download. Don't like how if you don't revive you have such a long period of resetting. Super annoying.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app much better than survival craft but I wish you could block people from joining your world. My little brother always wants to join but he messes stuff up.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|I rarely watch romantic comedies but was lured by the cast.  Not profoundly, not high art, but a cut above for romantic comedies.  It won't insult your intelligence.  The characters are just real and transparent enough to give the movie some substance.  This movie only tries to be what it is, a light movie that let's you laugh at some of the awkward parts of romance and enjoy the parts that work, be those fantasy or reality.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|This movie held pretty close to original movie. Dancing was just as good as original, and acting was better by some.
B00866JL96|5.0|My daughter and I absolute love Nicholas Sparks.  All of these movies are great.  I would purchase more movies from him

B00CDT41RY|4.0|Took me a long time to watch this movie it was a very long movie but it actually was good. A bit more profanity than I'd like but it was good
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|like my title says, its okay. the app constantly says I'm signed into the app on two devices so it will then erase my drawing and I have to restart the app. there's no way I'm signed into another device because I just made my account on this device only. I've never even used the app before. otherwise it would have 5 starts.
B008R1DNM6|3.0|I recalled seeing this movie back when I was a teen, and it was very different from other visions of the future.  The space and technology portrayed in the film were interesting and innovative, and still hold up well today.  The story-line is a bit heavy-handed, and that's coming from someone who tends to support environmental/ecologic causes.<br /><br />The story, in short, is that mankind has created several spacecraft that are 'Arks', keeping various animal and plant species alive in artificial domed environments in the hopes of one day repopulating the Earth.  However, the orders come down to jettison and destroy the domed pods, and one of the space-park rangers decides he can't follow those orders, and begins a quixotic quest to save the plants and animals he has so lovingly tended through the years.<br /><br />Bruce Dern is great as the plant-messiah, but the film tends to embrace a lot of 1970's tropes that just don't play well today, including music so dated and trite that I had to mute it (and my music player is filled with music from that decade that I lived through!).<br /><br />However, what is visionary is the conceptualization of spacecraft and technology, which was far ahead of anything else from this period, with the exception of '2001'.  There are no laser blasters or transporters, just big old honking space craft designed to preserve and protect the species of the Earth for a long time.  Yes, the robots and computers are retro.  Yes, Bruce Dern ends up in white robes like a prophet.  Yes, the music *sucks*.  Yes, ultimately the movie is dated.  But taken as a study in the history of film, it has elements that are transcendent and are still influential today.<br /><br />If you're interested in hard science fiction and are open to overlooking some dated trappings, this is still an enjoyable film, but overall it doesn't hold up as a standalone piece of work.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game rocks! You should play it. It's like 3x better than than temple run 1!!!!! Play th game NOW!!!!
B006P4FBUE|5.0|A limited kind of musical fun and certainly a great way to keep restless bored children occupied for a few minutes.  It has a pleasant sound and a good selection of songs!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Totally engrossing account which seems to be quite factual. I thought for the most part the acting was in the cinematography right on target.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love the game, I have played for quite a while but it very difficult to complete rooms and then I get bored and move to a different bingo game
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|Like a small but vocal minority regarding the previous LaBrie album, Static Impulse, I think I fall into the crowd of disliking the \\"cookie monster\\" vocals from Wildoer. That said, now that I've listened to Impermanent Resonance enough, I can say that it's well balanced. Only the first 3 tracks contain significant amounts of CM vocals. A few other tracks have some, but they're minimal and they're different than Static Impulse. The CM vocals could be described as better enunciated (less unintelligible screaming) and were mixed such that they're more laid back (as opposed to being in your face.)<br /><br />As for the album as a whole, it's amazing.<br /><br />\\"Agony\\" is a tune that opens the album with hard hitting riffs and rhythms.<br />\\"Undertow\\" starts with a strong synth lead to set the tone and then comes in with the heavy guitar. The tune isn't a catchy as Agony, but still will have you nodding your head.<br />\\"Back on the Ground\\" is a very catchy ballad with an incredible hook for a chorus. Lyrics are uplifting.<br />\\"I Got You\\" has a clever hook in the chorus -- I don't need stars that I can wish upon; And I don't need some magician with a magic wand.<br />\\"Holding On\\" is a solid down-tempo tune that alternates between quiet synth passages and heavy guitar passages.<br />\\"Amnesia\\" opens with a synth to set the tone and quickly breaks into heavy guitar and drums and then stops... to LaBrie's voice and a synth piano. And then the chorus hits with the full band. The contrast is very sweet. CM vocals were totally unnecessary on this track.<br /><br />What I can't figure out is why the European album got 2 bonus tracks and the American release didn't. That's just plain ridiculous. I recently just listened to both of them and they're really good. They're the icing on a really good cake.<br /><br />In short, Impermanent Resonance is an amazing offering from LaBrie and crew. Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|just like temple run but there are multiple courses. I am addicted to this game. you can costimize and dress up your minnon. I garentee you will like this game.
0439023521|5.0|I was completely drawn in by the post-apocalyptical time setting for this story.  I felt that I could really relate to Katniss in her struggle to take care of her family by gathering/hunting for food once her father was gone.  She was also so self sacrificing and noble.  I couldn't put the book down and needed to read the sequel immediately!

078322737X|5.0|Very good flick. Great music. Brought back a lot of memories of cruising Shoney's in my day on a jacked up 55 Chevy with 327/375 engine that hit so hard it rattled merchants windows on main street.  Instead of leaving friends for college, most of us were on our way to basic and Vietnam. Still, flick is a great rep of the day, the highjinx and pranks, parking at the lake, sock hops, drag racing, and chasing girls. Good, clean fun.

B003K16PAU|4.0|Good review of the poor in society prior to the era of  governmental social consciousness. I don't think we do much better now with modern welfare.  We don`t address the lack of hope that can only be cured by a productive life.  \\"Man does not live by bread alone.\\" The one who makes bread feeds his soul.

B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|I love this album. The boys of Helloween continue to blow away a lot of other Power Metal giants who have been in the field for longer than they have been. As a collector I have to say I prefer my cd's in a jewel case but this came in the cardboard digipak that a lot of companies are pushing these days. That's really my only complaint if I had to find one, but the music is really what we're talking about here. Helloween seems to have an endless supply of great material that always sounds amazing. Andy has one of the most &#34;Metal&#34; sounding voices around and he's not afraid to use it. The song &#34;Nabatea&#34; alone is well worth the price of the album. It's one of the most epic and powerful songs since Iron Maiden's &#34;Aces High&#34;. The whole album is full of Metal Gems. Are You Metal? Then you should pick this one up because there's no tricks - but lots of treats on this Helloween.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Great movie! Apologize for the tardy response. I'm new to #amazon still.<br />Nevertheless, the film was great, the item was accurate, and I would definitely do business with again. :)<br />-Bests.
B0038P9LTU|3.0|I listen to a lot of Metal. Just not big on the Orchestral stuff going on these days. I'm not really a big fan of the whole Lord of the Rings/Dungeons and Dragons type stuff either unless is pulled off really well. This album left me scratching my head because there are only a couple of tunes I even liked on this album. Christopher Lee (who starred in Lord of the Rings as well as numerous Hammer Films as Dracula) lends his speaking voice on this album, their are orchestras and choirs that preform on this album. But I can't say I'm all that impressed over all. The one track on the album even worth my time - and this is just my opinion- is the epic  song &#34;Sea of Fate&#34;. If only all the songs had that power running through them but instead they end up sounding a bit too contrived and &#34;artsy&#34; for my taste. &#34;Moonlight&#34; is about the only other redeeming track on this album. I can't say it's a bad album at all. I can only say that for me I have a hard time listening to it without picturing a bunch of dancing dwarves and Thor-like characters running about. Not really my kind of metal. But to each his own.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Great movie! Apologize for the tardy response. I'm new to #amazon still.<br />Nevertheless, the film was great, the item was accurate, and I would definitely do business with again. :)<br />-Bests.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Star Wars-Matrix-Blade Runner-Wall-E hybird that is not at all fractionally entertaining as those other films<br />A big steaming pile. But shame on me. I should of known better.
6304712936|5.0|Item was described as is. And I appreciate it 100X.<br />It is what I needed for my music studio! Bests.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|In playing this game, the similarities to tetris are obvious. The rods of various shapes falling from the top of the screen and the goal of creating a solid line of rods.<br />After that, the similarity ends, but not necessarily for the worse. You can't rotate the rods, which can, at times, make the game more difficult, but you can slide rods around before they fall and once they have fallen. The rods fall so fast that there's no way you could slide them as they fall.<br />There are other twists, such as rods coming from the bottom, immovable rods, and rods that can eliminate all rods of the same color.<br />Overall, I definitely recommend getting it! If you do, start with Zen mode. It's the perfect mode to master your art before you try Infinite and Survival.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|This is a movie that will be loved forever.  It's not your tradational movie but that is what makes special.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is the first search-type, story game I've played so I didn't know what to expect but it was pretty good. With a consistent pace and mini-games and puzzles to keep the game interesting, I enjoyed it.
B00AEFYKSO|5.0|Got to be one of the funniest baseball movie of all time.  Lots of actors that I loved in this movie and some that will go on to be nationally recognized.  Dennis Haysbert is GREAT!  He hit it out of the park for me.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|i think its not as good as minecraft but its still really close theres no mobs and no armor but its stiil good
B00C6B887S|5.0|I grew up reading comic books.  The Hellboy movies bring to life characters that will entertain me for years.  Right on!
B004FRX0MY|2.0|It said I could get mp3's of some music I had previously bought from Amazon, and it said it went to get them and downloaded them for me, and even showed me a list of artists that made sense as I had bought all those artists, but nothing was actually downloaded and my song list is empty.  I'll come back and try it again sometime maybe when it works properly.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|I liked it but the language is Strictly ADULT and not respectful.  Nice twist version just not something I would recommend for families.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|form filling, web searching, pecking at the on-screen keyboard, using the sketch pad all done more effectively with this stylus. as an amazon product the price misses the mark as a good value.
078322737X|5.0|This is a great classic movie and one that we wanted to have in our movie collection at home.  It was delivered promptly and in perfect condition.  We watched it the first day.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Addictive keep playing, keeps the boredom away, could play all night, slow to upload, on the kindle all upgrades are not available.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|This book was chosen  for discussion with a group of men and women.  It was successful in that area.  Not as captivating as we would have liked, but several topics opened the door to various perspectives dependent on age and life experiences.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love the hidden object games and this one also has alternative games. The graphics are good and the audio is clear. So far so good.
B000001FK3|5.0|Sad day for rock .  i like his songwriting and vocals and guitar work  i really like Crazy Mama  and Cajun moon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great book... I was up all night reading it. I couldn't stop! Suzanne knows exactly what she's doing.
0743201140|1.0|I specifically ordered a new book in order to receive the one-time code for the online part of the book.  When I received the book, the code was torn out of the back of the book, so basically I purchased a used book. Very disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Omg this book was better than the other two... dynamic ending and plot.I stayed up til twelve reading it, what with it's twisting, ever-changing story.I subscribe this for everyone.
0307887960|5.0|Book was like new, and the diet works miracles! Would recommend this book to anyone looking to shed some pounds.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game I'm impressed with the graphic and all around fun game the battles are a little tricky but other than that great game
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|my five year old loves the game but they need to fix the bugs because it freezes on her all the time :-(
B00000DHR0|5.0|CELINE'S CHHRISTMAS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE FOR THE HOLIDAYS, HER DUET WITH ANDREA BOCELLI OF &#34;THE PRAYER&#34; ALONE IS WORTH HAVING. CELINE IS A CLASSIC , BUT WITH ANDREA BOCELLI SHE IS A TRUE GIFT.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Never got close to owning a horse, even though that was my ambition as a child. This game sure helps fulfill my childhood dream, more or less. A realistic game, one for any horse lover, regardless of age.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|G.I. Joe: Retaliation was well worth watching. The movie offered a great cast of characters, and included both action and humor.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|One of my favorite brain games. The focus is problem solving and thinking in linear steps to decide what to do first and what to do next. Kept me interested for sure and I solved the puzzles fairly quickly. A timed version would be nice but I did enjoy moving at my own pace. An overall great game to be enjoyed by adults and I'd say preteens.
B006MR2ZQC|4.0|The product was good, however the seal was damaged while shipping so it was the only problem.<br />Containing mini figures are excellent.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The author lets you into her heart and mind, acknowledging the reality of what we must do to become who we were meant to be.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I think that anybody who is a wallflower or anybody that isn't anybody can translate to this book and I can honestly say I didn't want to read it at first but all my friends said it was really good so I did and I was sad when I finished it and I can't wait to see the movie
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I am finding this game to be difficult. I'm not enjoying it yet for that reason but I will keep trying.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|The movie was entertaining. It was fun to see the actors in different roles ie Jennifer Anniston and Colin Ferrel.
B005HAN0TG|5.0|My son is a very optimistic young man. He believes in \\"shadow of the doubt\\", he believes in giving a \\"second chance\\", he is very logical and open-minded. Not naïve by any means though. This is, in general, a good thing, but it can also backfire and become hurtful and wounding. I, on the other hand am skeptical. I ask questions, I always have doubts, even in my best friends. If I receive a junk mail with my name and address, or some other information on it, I don't simply put it in trash bin. I shred it. We leave in a human jungle, unfortunately to say so, but that's how the cookie crumbles.<br /><br />When I started reading John Grisham's THE PARTNER, I could almost guess the ending after the fifth chapter, and lo and behold, when I came to the end of it, my guess was correct. In fact I started laughing aloud as I finished the last page.<br /><br />It was an interesting novel. I enjoyed it thoroughly and highly recommend it.
B000FVE3AC|4.0|Bought it for my self, But is bit bigger than what i expected. Anyway i liked this watch. Thanks Invicta and Amazon.
0385737955|1.0|I was really interested by the back of this book from the first time I read it. It sucked. The beginning didn't catch my attention at all and she over explains everything. There wasn't enough character development of the other boys. I was confused form the very beginning and by the time I got to the end of the book, I was about to die. I will definitely not wait or read the sequel.
B008QLXSG8|5.0|Though the main character was almost entirely emotionless the entire time in a sort of humorous way,I loved the book. I liked the message it sent to me and the way it was written that kept the reader entertained. I have never read a book like this but so happy I did. One of my new favorites.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|this app is easier to use than most online shopping apps. I especially like the one click option to pay by linking payment site directly to your ebay account.  very convenient.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love it. It keeps our whole family entertained...ages ranging from 4 and up!!<br />Love the missions and the monthly change of country and characters.
B004KYLM0Y|5.0|Actually it's not just the best album of the best Seattle band. It's the best Mark Lannegan's ouvre. I really love it and the vinyl is a wanderful experience of listening music.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Don't show this movie to anyone under the age of 17. This movie has graphic and intense horror violence and gore.  Five friends trapped in a cabin.  A bridge washed away by rain.  The book of the dead is back.  A book that shouldn't have been read. A cellar door that shouldn't have been opened.  This movie is far superior to the original and one of the few horror remakes to exceed my expectations.  This movie is a solid NC-17.<br /><br />This movie is not suitable for anyone under 17 because the scenes may be too intense for younger viewers and may cause sleepless nights.  This movie is a horror movie clasic and equally as good as the original.<br /><br />This is a must have for every horror fan.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|Ann Hathaway delivers a masterful role of a young women facing the ravages of an increasingly debilitating disease and is struggling with her awareness of the burden she will impose on the love of her life in future years. In spite of a plot which could be depressing, she manages to portray the joy of love and life even under dire circumstances.
0425263924|3.0|I'm not sure what it is but something is lacking in this 3rd continuation of Eva and Gideon story. This 3rd and final book of the Crossfire series was very much anticipated , but once I started reading, it held no interest for me and I had trouble grabbing on to the story. Maybe that's the problem their really was no story to grab onto, instead it became a book I just wanted to finish so I could move on to another hopefully more fulfilling one.<br /><br />The story and character line seemed repetitive, I mean  there are just so many times Eva can say how gorgeous, sexy or handsome he is, its redundant.  I think Ms  Day had a problem getting to it's conclusion so much so that this appears to be filler to get to what hopefully will be the the 4th and final  book 4 of the Crossfire series  Lets hope.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Childish and underdeveloped, I don't know why i felt that it was a soog idea to finish the entire series.
B0014Z4OL6|5.0|From my previous study of the life of Mandela, I found this film to be factual and accurate.  This should be required viewing in middle school history classes.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I read many modern military books and this one does not hit the mark. There is so little information about the build-up to the hit on UBL that it leaves the reader feeling underwhelmed. I felt like this book was intended to impress the public with tales of how cool S.E.A.L. teams are.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Works without issue on my Samsung galaxy would like to see a zoom to better view images puzzles are of a large variety with a time limit
0152023984|5.0|What more can be said about this classic book?  It is my &#34;go to&#34; book for graduations, birthdays, and get well gifts.  You can never have too many copies.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|This game started out to be rather frustrating and slow going, but I am really glad that I didn't give up. It ended up being one of the more enjoyable point click games I have played. There is a hint guide, if you get stuck, but it doesn't always make sense. It becomes a bit clearer the farther you get in the game, but it may actually take longer to try and find the hint needed in the guide rather than just trying to figure it out on your own. There is a lot of going back and forth because everything you find is either a clue or a tool to solve another puzzle, but it is visually interesting and challenging without being impossible. It worked very well on my Kindle Fire and I didn't have any trouble with glitches at all.
B007WEQ3K8|1.0|I'm very disappointed . It isn't user friendly, levels aren't clear or even available, and the content & format is tedious and boring.
B008CJ0KBU|3.0|It came early, which was very nice, though the condition it was in was Not quite as good as I expected from the description, still It mostly works in my dvd player, and works completely fine when played from my computer.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|The second is worse than the first. I don't even think there was a QC on the script before it went into production. What a bust... And knowing is half the battle.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minions! What's not to love? The outfits are adorable and the reactions when you run into things or off the track make it just as fun to lose as it is to win.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game as I like puzzle type games - I did not feel it was like tetris except that you make rows! I appreciate the different modes on this game and started in zen mode to get a hang of it, although this mode would bore me after awhile as it has no real point to it! (you can't lose nor win) I miss some of the strategy aspects of tetris (clearing 4 row boxes, turning pieces etc.) but I might keep this around awhile. this downloaded and functions fine on my first gen kindle.
B00404YUG2|3.0|The War of Art was a little less than I expected.  Of course I expected a lot because of the fact that so many people I respect have suggested that I buy it and listen to it.  But upon further reflection, I do believe it made an impact on me.  An impact to get going and get started.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is my two daughter's new favorite game, very easy to use and fun for all kiddos. I give it thumbs up

B006ZWLXZ8|2.0|I bought a record player just to play this and when I got it was bent and out of shape. I have tried to fix it and it got better but it sounds a bit off.<br />If you can but it in a store. I know Urban Outfitters sells it but I just wanted to save some dollars.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This was actually the 4th copy I bought....I buy this series and give it to friends and relatives to keep...that's how much I love this series! Make sure if you watch it you watch from season 1. There is storyline and character development for sure you can't just jump into the middle of it. I will miss this series for sure!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|The best game for Kindle Fire in my opinion. Has good graphics, sound and presentation. The game play is top of the line for this style of games, the storyline is even descent. Once again, great game.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read this book after Chris was killed.  Being a former Marine, my love for my country and its servicemen has never faded.  This story about Chris and his life reaffirmed not only my faith in both country and its military but in God.  I can't wait to meet Chris in heaven and thank him for what he did!

B004XE0P5E|5.0|this cd has a sound to it that is not of this era and there are things I like about each song. definitely don't find this stuff just anywhere.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Most of the puzzles are on screens with enough contrast, but there are a few that are a tad too dark on my Thinkpad X60t's screen.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I was so hooked on this season that I couldn't stop watching and ended up staying up all night. I would have stayed up longer if my stamina hadn't given out.  This show is high quality from top to bottom---from production values to the cast of incredibly talented actors.  Amazon Prime is awesome!! I love the ability to watch it on my TV using Amazon Prime and the quality is absolutely top notch as well.  I find that Amazon Prime has a lot more viewing options than Netflix for me and I prefer it.  Although Season 4 is not free with Amazon Prime, it's still available via Amazon and definitely worth the cost to view the season.  I'm a very pleased customer.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Wish his second book was on Kindle. Had to skip to the third of the series. These books will surely get you hooked.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game iz really fun and addiciting! I would give this game 5 out 5 stars because it doesnt slow down when i play and i really have fun with it . Learning new tricks and besting the missions.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I dont like Tom Cruise much but I enjoyed this movie so much he didn't bother me for a change. great fx and an interesting idea.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my opinion is that you get to play like u r in the movies and that it is your job to help this little minion get minion of the year.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved the book but thought it was somewhat incomplete. Did not like the ending. It seems that Eric just fades away, not to be heard from again. I would like to know how he is coping in Oklahoma, and if he still thinks of Sookie.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I can only surmise that the people who found this movie to be bad fall in one of these categories:<br />1. Immature<br />2. Uneducated<br />3. Uninterested in life's mystery<br />4. Atheist so opposed to the idea of God that beauty escapes them<br /><br />The Tree of Life is a love song to the complexity, the ugliness, and most importantly, the beauty of life's mystery. It will be appreciated in centuries to come, while the movies that appear regularly in top 100 lists today fall into obscurity. The Tree of Life is one of the great works of art of the 21st century.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Having so much fun with it but having trouble challenging my friends. But still having a blast in racing. Thanks
0817439390|5.0|I purchased this book on the advice of my friend.  I have learned a lot.  As I am a newbie to photography with a &#34;good&#34; camera.  I want to learn as many techniques as possible.  This book is a great place to start.  It gives you good ideas and instructions to begin to learn how to do more advanced techniques.  I have enjoyed learning about photography.  Every book that helps me understand even one part of this technical art is most welcome.  Thanks for the great book.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I love this game, I think it's the best game I have ever played. I reccommend everyone to buy this game.
B004LWZW8I|4.0|Engaging movie to watch - a bit confusing at first and not exactly the Theseus story that I studied in school, but it's entertaining. Cavill does a very good pre-Superman performance.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This a really good app if you want to be entertained. But the bad part is you can not play multi player with a KINDLE!

1609611543|1.0|Another puggy low carber telling us how to lose the weight he can't.  At least ALL the guys pushing high carbs are skinny.  That shouldn't make you wonder which of the ways of eating will cause you to lose the most weight with the least physical harm. Do I buy off on the pure Vegan thing? NO!  But I'm certainly not buying into eating tons of meat and diary loaded with growth hormone and antibiotics and only God knows what else.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app is my favorite. It starts easy bet then it gets harder and harder by the last one you are really using your brain. Once again its great. Get this app!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful musical, and the transition to a movie was handled very well.  What few changes were made from the musical to the movie only serve to highlight the inherent power of this beautiful story.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|If you liked the \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Harry Potter\\" series' you should really like the \\"Mortal Instruments\\" series too. Not deep literature but why were other readers expecting Shakespeare? It is what it is. Very appropriate for teens though I'd suggest parent(s) maybe read series also too see that several \\"mature\\" (older teen) themes get resolved. \\"The Hunger Games\\" had more adult story line / themes than these. Harmless adventure and romance. Gave 1st book to my 14 y/o niece to read. I give the entire series 4.5- 5 stars.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This gives me all the information that I was looking for. With my COPD, the air quality is very important to me. The forecast is as accurate as most weather man's predictions. All the information is laid out in a easy format.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This app is pretty cool. But the only thing I wish they would change is that it doesn't give you enough time to win. Before you can get someone in checkmate it tells you it's a draw by stalemate. But other then that it's a great app.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Everyone (barr 1) at my bookclub loved this book.  Gillian Flynn is a fantastic writer, i just wanted to keep turning the pages.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I HATE the adverts! I miss the extras like the photos that are submitted by people online.  Compared to the last version this one is just too busy. I find it VERY annoying. The time lapse on the radar doesn't seem to work...at least not for me. I still have it but not using it nearly as much as I use to.
B00AW57L96|3.0|Easy read, great if you are wanting something aussie to read.  Simply written, this author will be one to watch in future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely loved every minute of this book! I could not even put it down. Had it read in two days!
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I saw him is concert and that made me want to purchase..I was not dissapointed at all...he sounds GREAT and the duet with Dolly Paarten is suprisingly awsome....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is pretty fun. Each level gets a little more challenging and the tasks are clever. Looking forward to more levels.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Love this historical fiction.  It takes the stories of American, British, French and Russians from the start of WWI to the end.  Cannot wait to read the sequel.
B0018O4YT0|1.0|I saw the original and in the director's cut, they cut the most important scene.  The scene where he gets the telepathic abilities to fight with the aliens.  Even before that, there were a few areas where the DVD kept playing but the scene on the TV kept still.
B0026ISUUQ|5.0|This movie is about a passionate woman with a heart for the poor. I love that it is in Kibera Slum, in Nairobi, Kenya, where I have also worked with marginalized women in empowerment programs. It is hard to watch at times but the story may be fiction could certainly happen with greedy companies out for money and power.  So sad.  Great movie!
B0050R0YB8|5.0|Last year, I saw this in the LEGO store window fully assembled.  I fell in love and I must have been talking about it a lot because I just received it as a gift!<br /><br />My 6 year old son and I assembled it and you know what?  He did most of it while I watched and set the pieces out.  There were only a few times I had to correct him and there were several times where he corrected me.  We worked on it almost everyday for at least an hour.  There were some tedious portions where you build 12 or 10 of the exect same small components.  Overall, it's amazing to see it come together and seeing my son puzzle out the assembly made it more amazing.  I don't know why people rate the educational value of a kit like this so low.  I think it's a great lesson in following instructions, spatial representation, and basic engineering techniques.<br /><br />It sits in one of our berooms because my wife didn't like the idea of it being the centerpiece for our kitchen.  Everytime I look at it, I get a little giddy.  I am missing 2 pieces that were not critial, but I plan on ordering them this weekend.<br /><br />Also, kudos to the LEGO team that designed this.  It it amazing and if they came out with the Clone Wars Galactic Cruiser in this size tomorrow, I'd buy it!<br /><br />11 Nov 2013 Update:  Everyday I wake up and see it sitting on my bookshelf and I think to myself \\"Damn that is cool as hell!\\"  Also, my son brings everyone in to show it off.  He's quite proud as well.
B000J2BRQU|2.0|When I first saw it I honestly thought the main character was cast in an attempt to not overshadow Little Bow Wow's filler character. The racing was cool, but almost none of the characters were very compelling. To me, it seemed like everyone was trying too hard to be something they weren't: Adults playing American teens, Little Bow Wow's character trying to seem relevant, contrived parental conflict, American kid in a Japanese high school and taking over the drift scene (really?). I'm not at all interested in seeing any of the new characters in future \\"Fast\\" films.<br /><br />I say it's a solid 2.5. If I had been watching it on TV instead of at a theater I don't know that I would have sat through it. I don't see how anyone who has seen any of the other \\"Fast\\" films can rate this higher than a 3.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I just love the way that Mr. Stein has written this book I was absolutely hooked from page one ..... such a beautiful book
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoy the drama and romance in this series!! I can't wait to watch the next season!! I could watch them all day :)
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this is a great pass time game it is one of those games where u can stop and not like loose ur place in your game or have to start over and. u can personalize it to make it suit ur standards it is an alaround cool game accept watch your pocket. when u get into the game
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|this was a good satisfiable experience with this video we enjoy in family last time from amazon.com thanks you. ni
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This is slow loading and freeses up when ever it is launced I will be deleteing it from my tablet.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Play this with strangers around the world. No one loses and any one can make pictures  to ability to draw. Good
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great app, great price. I enjoy the deal options and the ability to tap the cards instead of dragging them.
0425263916|5.0|Eva will hurt Gideon in the end of the series, Cary wants to continue to pimp Eva and her family. Eva's mother made choices that wasn't easy to make so she could take care of her child that she is overly protective of. For Eva Gideon is willing to do anything to have her in his Life. Eva and Cary are both very needy and jealous people. When Gideon sees what Cary is up to in his feelings for Eva, Cary could be in danger. I hope Eva's stepfather wise up on how he is being used. I don't think the series will end in a Happy everafter, It takes two people to be committed to each other. I hope Gideon and his sister get closer, he will need her. There will be more mystery to the story to be uncovered. I hope the author don't disappoint with alot of fillers and fluff. The first two books were great reads.
B006RXSW5O|4.0|The issue was not that there were not funny parts, but that my attention faltered more often than I would like. I wasn't drawn in enough.
B004LPLU4K|4.0|I watched this with my 6 year old daughter and we both really enjoyed it.  It was a good family movie.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I enjoyed it but it wasn't the type of movie you see if you are wanting great acting and or award winning scenes. Just an action flick with just about every major actor from this genre. I recommend this to anyone who wants to just camp on the couch for a few hours and watch the action.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|All the actors sound amazing! For the most part it stays true to the musical with the exception of the new song added.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is a classic Nicholas Sparks novel, but with a twist. It really opened my eyes and my mind to the horrors and reality of domestic violence. It is a great read and for me was hard to put down. There is suspense, love, fear, and joy. You won't be disappointed!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game.. I enjoy it & I think you would to. I like the different tours the characters go on. And the new tricks that are added.
0345803507|5.0|Leaves you hanging but great story and followup to the previous 2 stories..... not as raunchy as the first 2 books
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the best app I've had in a while. Now i can look up stuff without having to go to Google and have adds pop up out.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Love Downton Abbey Season 1, 2, and 3! Just when things started to go well they had to give it a bad ending. Perfect for someone looking for a good drama.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie moved at a good pace with an interesting storyline and quality acting.<br />Pop some popcorn and enjoy...definitely worth your time!
B004EI2NM2|5.0|Not only are these young ladies beautiful to look at, but they were excellent performers, and VERY enjoyable to watch.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games was an original concept, brought to life by an absolutely amazing author. It's impossible not to laugh and mostly cry along with the characters. Do not read without a box of tissues nearby!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Enjoyed reading this story. Pleasant and entertaining at the same time. I could place myself in the country setting right beside the people in the book. I will look for more of this author's books.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone and they are a huge batman fan and really loved this movie!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies I have ever watched, this is art in motion. Masterpiece. Loved it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Whether you read it before or after the HIT, you will enjoy it.  Don't want it to end but can't wait to finish.  That's a good book!
B00746O3X8|4.0|This item is so useful especially for my hobby.  Thank you so much for on time delivery.  I would highly recommend this product.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I didn't understand the game . Would love to know how to download  candy crush saga. The real game. Can someone help me. Thanks
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this game! It keeps her entertained plus she loves horses! It's great for in the car and on the air plane!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I got this mainly for the sleep monitoring, though the activity tracker is honestly what I use more often. I like how it combines with the Withings scale I already have. I get a nice picture of how my weight gain/loss relates to my activity increases/decreases. It's motivating, without actually pressuring you to do anything. All it does is set 'healthy goals' and any progress you make towards that is considered good.<br /><br />One flaw I found in the new healthmate website (a replacement for the old dashboard that came out in conjunction with the Pulse) was the goal periods seem to not understand the idea of 'yah, I got distracted and stopped trying to lose weight and now I'm trying again.' I hadn't used my scale for 5 months before this, so with my 'weight goal' being 20 pounds to go, and the latest weight test being .1 pounds lower than my 5 months ago weight, it decided that with that weight loss per time ratio, I'd meet my goal in 2091, presumably from dying. I'm not sure how the algorithm is set up, but presumably it will continue to be inaccurate..<br /><br />Overall though, the healthmate system is great, and integrates everything in the Withings 'family' of products in a really great way. It 'just works' together.<br /><br />The Pulse, and everything else in the Withings 'family', are all about the gamification of health to me. I've already noticed a difference, trying to meet that 10000 step goal. I'm taking the stairs more often, not being as efficient (lazy) with how I get from point A to point B while at work and on my off time. On my first work day with the Pulse I managed 8500 steps, so I'm getting close. :)<br /><br />Some people elsewhere in the comments have been having problems with firmware, well that wasn't an issue for me. During a manual sync I got a prompt to upgrade, and although the reconnect was odd (it restarts, and obviously loses the connection, and acts like this was an unexpected development, so you just have to reconnect), it wasn'tdebilitating, and only happened once. The manual syncing has been kind of a pain, I haven't figured out if there's some sort of trick to it, but sometimes it'll start the sync process when my phone is on standby, other times it won't. Sometimes it'll do it when I have the app open, other times it won't. Once I couldn't get it to work at all, so I reset the bluetooth on my phone and then it worked fine. I think this is just the growing pains of working around dozens of different Android devices and all their bluetooth quirks. I have a Pebble smartwatch and experienced similar issues early on, which have since been sorted out.<br /><br />So back to the main reason I got it: sleep monitoring. I've always had this weird idea, that maybe I sleepwalk and nobody's ever told me. Well now I know the answer! I know for certain, that in the last 2 days, I did not sleep walk. I did however wake up to go to the bathroom, and the Pulse accurately showed when and for how long and presented the information to me on a nice graph. I've also learned, that despite my long held belief, it really doesn't take me that long to fall asleep. I suppose the only particularly useful information is the duration of sleep you get over long periods of time, as this relates to your health and mood and what not. But all of the other data Pulse gathers is still really interesting to be able to look at.<br /><br />The jury's still out on whether or not this will help me lose weight, but one thing is for certain.<br /><br />For the last two days I haven't been sleepwalking.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a REALLY great game where you can build anything you want to. I highly recommend this game. It deserves an 5 out of 5 star rating and MOJANG did an REALLY good job at making this game.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I remember playing this on some flash based website, and loosing the bookmark for it... But to see this on the app store made me so happy! A must have for any Solitare addict!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Still getting used to the new bond...still a Connery fan but the movie had great special effects and was a good story...worth watching...

B00BYOEZTI|3.0|just okay...I wish I had the required number of words give a better review...but, it was simply boring I thought...
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is so much fun. I enjoy playing games, but this one is fun because you get to play with your friends.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This cd was in great condition. No to little wear on case, little sticker residue- no biggie. Quality was good
B00125JP1C|5.0|The story is crazy over-the-top.<br /><br />The acting and direction stellar.<br /><br />An overlooked classic of the action genre that deserves to be remembered.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Helped me to download my son's favorite videos to the Nabi 2 without giving him access to related videos.<br />Good for helping him to view only appropriate videos.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Works good but the kindle screen doesn't drag and drop accurately.  I have this same  app on my Sanding Galaxy Nexus phone and the play on that device is superior.
B001EN71CW|5.0|The BEST SHOW that FOX TV ever cancelled! Everyone that I have ever recommended this to, has gotten hooked on it and wishes that it could be revived. To try and describe the show would do a disservice to it. \\"Space Western?\\" Nah! Doesn't do it justice.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version finally allows us to viddy the episodes successively without having to go through the menu every time!
B001NFNFIK|4.0|I am a big fan of James Lee Burke's novels about Dave Robicheaux and have been reading them for years. The location and the way this film was shot portrayed the same swampy, Southern atmosphere that I saw in my mind's eye as I read the books. Tommy Lee Jones was very good at playing the part of Dave. The movie kept my interest the entire time.  Would love to see more of the JLB books made into films.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice challenge and pretty easy to get hooked.  About the time I was ready to give up I found the solution.  Keep looking and try all combinations of clues and tools.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|like the weather info as well as the availability of additional info pertaining to the environment. this helps with planning as well as thinking about our environment
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is an extremely awesome game, but starting just today it wouldn't let me log on at all. not into my facenook account for the take or my gameloft account. it'd be great if fixed.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|maybe it is a good game.  I got the free version which you have to purchase addt'l game tools to get full benefit  of the game
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really good game. A lot of people give negative reviews because of the update problem,but I personally have never had that problem, I believe that they have fixed it. Overall I think it is a great game for everyone to play!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I much prefer this version.  Loads faster, is easier to find the info I want and the layout, in my opinion, is cleaner.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game and the updates come so fast!! I think it is a great game and you should download it right now :)
B008I43DYU|3.0|I find it difficult to consistently use the equal sign after each operator sign is added not to mention the awkward use of the memory function
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app its such a fun app and I never ever get bored but they need to stop with all of the facebook stuff not every one has one
B00957T6X6|5.0|Can't stop reading/listening. Glad I saw the series first or I would have gotten lost but I love story. Love it!
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I have had this album since the day it was released a few months back and let me tell you it was well worth the wait.  If you like Tom Keifer and the Cinderella sound, it's a no brainer...buy it!  He sounds incredible and the variety of tunes on this album are a great mix.  My favorites are The Flower Song, Cold Day in Hell, Ain't That a Bitch, Solid Ground, Babylon, and It's Not Enough. He is one of the greatest vocalists and talents in Rock n Roll and we are really lucky to have this gem come out in 2013 after a long time without any new material being released.  Hopefully there will be more to come in the near future!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoy the game it is a fast moving game.It would be nice if you got a free life with every so many points.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I'm going out for a run now. great book with amazing people. not just about running but also about life
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The second I played this game I knew it was perfect and oh it is because I PLAY it every day
B00CRS88IO|5.0|One thing I always appreciate is when I learn something new in a book I read. The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada did just that.  I never knew that Ian Fleming based his Bond series after his own experiences, nor did I know he wrote Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!<br /><br />As a child, I was a big Bond fan, but after Moore left the series, I had lost interest. The way the author developed Ian reminded me of that old Bond charm, particularly the way Roger Moore portrayed him. Loved the scene where he was pouring a drink moments before the French started firing at him in a plane he had stolen.<br /><br />The plot follows Ian on route to negotiate with the French commander Darlan. Either they surrender the French to the British or get attacked. He teams up with the French resistance, and Ian has to prove himself to them.  An exciting climax should satisfy any reader who appreciates spy novels and James Bond.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Rollins keeps you wrapped up in his characters and action moving. His word choice is worthy for a good reader (love kindle app to verify meanings!).
B001I45UFC|5.0|I have always loved this book ever since I was a little kid! I do not remember a lot of Narnia but now I hope I will remember it all.
1442419814|5.0|I can't express how many times I've read a books tag where it talks about x or y main character with insert conflict here which gets worse when add mysterious romantic interest comes into the picture.  Here is a book that does not do that.  While there is romantic interests, the main character's attractions are critizied when they come at the expense of her friends.  While it causes her at times to make bad decisions, this is with a cost and it's made very plain.  This is a story not is not only wholly enthralling, but it manages to embrace moral ambiguitites.  When choices are made there are prices to pay and never are these glossed over or ignored.  There is not a point where someone gets away with being selfish or foolish.  The characters are all complex including the villains and nothing is black and white.  Having read all three books I can say that there is no point I was left unsatisfied with the story.  I would recommend this book (and the rest of the series) to anyone.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|the book kept my interest but was sometimes frustrating as I was expecting more self growth of the main charactor through his continuous visits to his childhood self
0385486804|5.0|finally, the book is really makes me think critically about the people that they don't Have a single goal or dream to achieve in their life they just live without any motivation to anything  as saw Chris he scarified his life and left everything he loved behind his back to reach Alaska.The general emotions in the book were love to hitchhiking and going to Alaska, determination on his decisions and the power to achieve his desired end  suffering and exploring of being alone without help or  Humans around and nobody form his friends or his sister.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This book has such a different world in it that it is a bit hard to understand for little kids but i think it is lois lowry's greatest book.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Well written, suspenseful, developed characters.  I enjoyed this book.  Pulls the reader in and makes it a real endeavor to solve the mystery.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a fun game, and this will be fun if you have 4 players you can play with 2 players but you can't block with 2 players.
0345404475|4.0|WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD:<br />We all know.........well, most of us.......that DO ANDROIDS DREAM.... is the basis for the movie BLADE RUNNER. While the basic premises of the story are used for the film, I am certainly glad that I'd seen the film about 30 times before reading the book! I realize that Philip K. Dick is one of the best sci-fi-writers of our time here in this miserable existence and he makes it all too clear just how miserable that existence is! The similarities.....or perhaps the dis-similarities are.....between the book and movie are abundant. Perhaps I didn't read this book at the &#34;right time&#34; in my life but I found it more depressing than uplifting, like the ending of the movie is. In the movie, Deckard has a future that is bright, even though his own personal replicant is doomed. In the book, Dekard's existence is the one that is doomed: doomed to live out his miserable existence has a Blade Runner!
1451695195|5.0|This is just even more proof of our afterlife with God. I was very impressed. I do have two questions, however, that I would like to have had answered by Eben Alexander. (1) The only persons he met when he went to heaven were God and his never-met blood sister. Most other after-life books I have read indicate that they had met either their parents, close friend(s), or siblings, etc. Why wasn't anyone else there to meet him? (2) Not one word was mentioned of Christ. Most every other book I have read on after-life experiences met Christ. If Eben Alexander gets this post, I would love to have his response to my questions. Thank you very much.
0812550706|5.0|Yes, read it before November, when the movie is released and you will see if it is as true to the book as you hope it can be.<br />Highly recommend the book..............a true sci-fi classic!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book started out strong and then just unraveled.  By the end, there were so many loose ends, i couldn't keep track.  Characters were introduced and never mentioned again.  I loved both of the other books I read by this author.  And while he is a very talented and gifted writer, it felt like he was going to miss deadline and just wrapped things up as quickly as possible.
B00B10CT7A|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie and the message it portrays.  The four pillars of life are explained and the movie is not just about surfing, but life.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|This is not a very fun game.  I've only played it once or twice. Maybe a little kid would like it better.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|The graphics are grand, but they do suck up the  battery charge. I like to play without a time limit. Even the few levels that do set a clock ticking can be reset by skilled play. I keep changing my name and playing through adventures.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I love this update -- very clever.  Crisp visuals, nice sound.  They are such a cute couple (jk).  The repartee between the Holmes and Watson character, and between Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes, is priceless.  Very well done, contemporary without losing the original Conan Doyle stories in the process.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I rarely read fiction, perhaps one or twice a year.  That said, after I saw the movie the novel intrigued me.  Brooks' novel is far better than the movie, which is just a slice of the narrative.  The book has several moral lessons (without being preachy) and some humorous passages (enjoy the irony/humor of the BMW observation on page 413).  That said, the book's ending was flat and devoid of imagination.  Perhaps Brooks was attempting to be profound at the end.  If so, I missed it.  Or did Brooks simply run out of gas?  CEC
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I disagree with all the negative reviews on this latest addition to the story of Gideon and Eva.  The book was fantastic! And I hear that two two more are on the way!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i got the game and it was great i played it everyday and got addicted i highly recommend this game
B005LAIIKI|1.0|If there was a film where a white guy went round shooting every black character on set (all of whom are the epitome of evil) and then the lead actor at a ceremony went on to boast about killing black people, the the film would be banned, the actor disgraced and his career ruined. However, apparently racism is a white only problem according to the media and black people are incapable of this type of sin, which as a white person i find not only offensive but is also plain wrong as Foxx proved in spades in his &#34;i killed all the white people - how great is that, how black is that&#34; speech.
B001NLL0RW|4.0|Action packed adventure involving villains trying to control the people of the world ... members of the sigma force were Indiana Jones, James Bond and Special Forces.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|I purchased this for my husband who likes watching bands and loves music and he loved it! He originally saw it on television and wanted the dvd.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works perfectly on my kindle fire hd.  I use it all the time, and it's free!  You can't beat that.
B00E1942VO|5.0|Just as all of Five Finger Death Punch's albums, this is great from start to finish.  Unfortunately, I mistakenly purchased the edited version of the album and find that the censorship kills it for me.  I guess that I will have to purchase this album again; this time I will make sure that I buy the proper one.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|very very very very very good. I loved it so much. good condition. beautiful man. happy i bought it. love it!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I enjoy this game. It is easy to play and does not need constant attention. I love the dinosaurs and my son likes to poke them. lol
B0059WTMLW|5.0|It has a variety of play options and difficulties. Got it in the free app a day deal, not disappointed. I haven't touched my other sudoku apps.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Best book ever I loved it. It might have been sad at first but my favorite book I have ever read
B001AX9DT0|5.0|I had seen this singer on YouTube and fell in love with his voice....Now I'm so glad I did....He has that lonesome quality....I get lost in the music...
0312641893|5.0|I would recommend this book as a &#34;family-friendly&#34; book that provides an interesting twist on the traditional Cinderella story.  A great read.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|An amazing and important book about a society that any of us could even imagine. At times sad,  at times absurd but very interesting and well-written.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Good movie really I liked it. I watched in amazon instant video and the quality was poor. I could not see details and I think a blue-ray version would do the job. I recommend it (but please buy the blue-ray version)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book continued to demonstrate how human beings are the only species that kill each other.  Although fiction there is a lot of truth to this book.  Very suspenseful with many twists and turns.  Excellent ending as katniss fights her demons but has a happy ending.  I wish there were more books like this!
B000ID37RM|4.0|I had to read the book for high school and wanted to see how close it was to the book.  It matched the book fairly well.  I enjoyed the movie, but the book was definitely better.
0765367297|5.0|As a fan of the Halo series on the original Xbox and Xbox 360, I owed it to myself to read this book. (Note: I never read anything except for magazines and I absolutely loved this book!) Overall is was great from beginning to end.
B008MM9630|3.0|Things take too long to grow other than that it is ok will play once in a while hope to play more in future

B0063IH60K|5.0|great single solitaire game ever! needs Internet but can be played several times without it. have fun with this GAME!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I think no matter where you look, you'll generally find good reviews for this CPU. I personally have nothing bad to say about it, this is the CPU I picked for my first gaming build. Originally, I planned to buy an i7. However with a little research, I found that dollar for dollar, the i7 simply wasn't worth it. The performance increase wasn't worth the extra money, which got me searching for an i5. I think this is a wonderful higher end i5 and works beautifully for me when gaming both online and off when paired with my Asus P877-V LX LGA motherboard. One of my favorite games is League of Legends, and I'm able to run it with the highest end graphics via a VGA Sapphire 100358L HD7770 1G just fine.<br /><br />The package comes with the CPU as well as a round Intel heat sink with pre-applied thermal compound, so no need to go through the effort of buying a tube and then wondering how much to apply (perfect for first time builders!). I think the price is very reasonable for both, since you'll end up spending at least $30 for a standard heat sink. I personally did not use the heat sink included, I purchased a contained liquid cooler (CORSAIR CW-9060007-WW) for it which seems to work great. Some reviewers mention that this CPU tends to run hot if you really work it, so keep liquid cooling in mind when considering cooling options.<br /><br />Honestly if you're thinking about upgrading your computer or building a new one, consider this CPU! Save a little money getting a top of the line i7 and go with an SSD instead, (I loaded Windows on my Samsung SSD and startup time is approx 15 seconds, restart is around 30) you won't regret it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is sooooo fun! need more floors....we play it all the time! fun for the whole family.  makes you think.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I teach middle school Social Science, and spend a lot of time trying to communicate good citizenship. This book was signed to my students by my principal, and it expertly teaches more about the goodness in community than I ever could from my podium. So honestly written in the style of fifth grade, so honest about cruelty, courage, and redemption. I'm breathless, sobbing, and totally in love with these characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game<br />Fun game, easy to play,hard to leave.<br />Don't spend to much tokens in the in the first levels.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|WHAT WILL WE SEE IN THE EXTENDED EDITION:<br /><br />1. More of DALE, including the BLACK ARROWS. Director Peter Jackson mentions a previously unseen character: \\"Girion, who is defending [the city of] Dale using black arrows against Smaug. And the black arrows play a part in an ongoing story, for they are the one thing that can pierce the dragon's hide.\\"<br /><br />2. More king of the wood elves; THRANDUIL. Peter Jackson: \\"There are also issues with Thranduil. We get some of the reason why he and the dwarves had a falling out - to do with these white gems...\\"<br /><br />3. More of HOBBITON. Producer Phillipa Boyens: \\"You are going to get more of Hobbiton. We always wanted to wend our way through Hobbiton, but in the end Bilbo has to run out of the door.\\"<br /><br />4. The OLD TOOK'S PARTY: In which we see a younger Gandalf meet Bilbo Baggins as a young child, convincing the wizard of the young hobbit's bravery and courage. I won't spoil it for you, but it involves a dragon and a bit of magic.<br /><br />5. Dwarf antics at RIVENDELL. Peter Jackson: \\"You are going to get some serious Dwarvish disrespect of the elves at Rivendell.\\" Bofur leads the troupe in a rowdy chorus of \\"The Man in the Moon\\", a classic Tolkien pub-song.<br /><br />6. The SONG of the GOBLIN KING. Producer Fran Walsh: \\"You are going to get more Goblin Town, and the Great Goblin singing his song. It is a great song, but it was just another delay in terms of moving the story along.\\" Peter Jackson: \\"A number one hit from the Goblin King. Barry Humphries is going to rise up the charts!\\"<br /><br />Well, all looking good on these fronts! The roads lead ever on and on...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is literally the first app I've ever downloaded. Excellent Game!! The graphics are amazing!! It's ease of use  keeps my son entertained without the frustration factor that's usually associated with computer games at his age.

0756405890|5.0|Until I read The Name of the Wind, I did not know the true meaning of \\"I stayed up all night reading\\". I thought it was merely an expression, a harmless exaggeration. Well, with The Name of the Wind, I ACTUALLY stayed up half the night reading it.<br /><br />This was, and I am NOT exaggerating, a book that I did not want to put down. Every time I did, I felt I lost something from the story. The Name of the Wind is more than a book. It is an engrossing journey. Another cliche that I found was true was \\"I was hooked from the FIRST line.\\" In my case, it was not the first line, but the second:<br /><br />\\"The Waystone inn lay in silence, and it was a silence of three parts.\\"<br /><br />Seriously? That is so awesome I could repeat it for hours in my epic trailer voice. It sounds like the world's coolest tagline, and best, it doesn't even make sense!

B004JK61K0|1.0|The application just kept freezing during set up, after 40 minutes of frustration I decide to spend some money and purchase a 4.50 app
B001P829VY|5.0|The Treasure of Sierra Madre is fast-paced, darkly comic, action-packed, and entertaining, but it also manages to be thought-provoking, visually stunning, brilliantly acted, and lastingly excellent.<br /><br />Many have tried to imitate this film, but none have come close to capturing the adventure, hope, mystery, greed, fear, danger, and paranoia that John Huston brings with his stunning cast (Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt, and Walter Huston ) and excellent cinematography, screenplay, and score accomplish in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.<br /><br />Hailed as one of the greatest films ever by Roger Ebert, Stanley Kubrick, Sam Raimi and more, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is, like all true classics, always watchable, always funny, always brilliant. Humphrey Bogart is typically excellent as the morally grey slacker Fred C. Dobbs, Tim Holt is great as Bob Curtin, Dobbs's friend and partner who retains his moral compass. But the real star of the show is Walter Huston, father of director Jack Huston, who's performance as the grizzly old prospector Howard is electrifying, entertaining, colorful, and brilliant. He won a well-deserved Oscar for his immortal performance, and it is truly one of the finest of all-time!<br /><br />One of John Huston's favourite themes in film was adventure. His characters are daring, brave, and fearless. He truly captures the spirit and allure of the wild, and the trials and triumphs of those who braved it. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is perhaps his best film; enduring, entertaining, technically and narratively brilliant, it ranks among the greatest films of all time.<br /><br />Five Stars! Also recommended; John Huston's brilliant morality/honour/greed tale [[ASIN:B004VFONHG The Man Who Would Be King]], starring Michael Caine, Sean Connery, and Christopher Plummer.<br /><br />P.S. Unlike the bandits in the film, I do want my stinkin' badges. Top reviewer badges, to be precise. So if you found this review helpful, give it a like and read my other reviews. Cheers!d my other reviews. Cheers!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Well, its, ok, I guess. What more can I say, it is solitaire in its most simple Windows 3.1 pre-XP form! At least you can change the card background, but thats about it. It provides entertainment while I am waiting for land permissions to perform my survey work, and at least it doesn't really use any battery so that the main pro.

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is a phenomenal read.  Enough twists and turns that it remained delightfully unpredictable.  The character depth was wonderful, I am excited for the next book.
1426308469|5.0|My grandson is 5 and is obsessed! He can tell you anything you ever want to know about dinosaurs so this book was a must for his library. The pictures and detail are amazing and he absolutely loves it! I did not find a problem with the cover or the content. The book seems as sturdy as any of the others I have purchased. He has looked at and we have read the book, which is very detailed, at least 50 times. I would recommend to any dinosaur lover!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The first impression I had of this book was  that it was a relatable story about the evolution of love, marriage, and companionship-  most specifically the intense lucky feeling that you've found the best equation for success among millions of idiots that just don't get it, later followed by boredom, resentment and disappointment. Then the twist, where you can't really relate at all.  And by the second  twist, you're downright suckered into the same trap as the featured married couple.<br />Give it a read.<br />First book I couldn't put down in a while.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's awesome, I think this game is better than temple run. Why would anyone want to play anything else.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|There is not much &#34;extra&#34; in the unrated version but what is there is hilarious! Better than the theatrical or earlier DVD relases as it's widescreen.

B00BGIBVRG|1.0|How movies like this get funded, I'll never know.  The characters are so self centered and demented.  There is nothing redeeming about this movie.
B00242KCWS|4.0|\\"Sonic Brew,\\" the debut from Black Label Society, the side-project of Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde, is stuffed to the gills with great solos and killer riffs. It is so successful and satisfying on this level, in fact, that it almost does not need any other attributes. But the heck of it is, the album also comes with respectable songwriting! And when you marry these two traits with strong hooks, catchy vocals, a solid rhythm section, and powerhouse choruses, and the end result is easily one of the best hard rock and sludge/doom/stoner metal records of 1999.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"Bored To Tears,\\" a piece of true, Seventies-esque hard rock with a big riff, some wah-wah-ish guitar licks, and a bit of nicely jazzy soloing. This is then followed-up by \\"The Rose Pedalled Garden,\\" a piece, that, save for its use of a piercing, spectral guitar intro, bluesy acoustic breakdown, and blazing melodic solo, sounds like it could also have a home on any `70's-era Black Sabbath record. But following that is where things really start to get interesting, as \\"Hey You (Batch Of Lies)\\" sandwiches some lovely acoustic breakdowns and slightly melodic bass lines, in between the usual abundance of pounding, churning, sludgy riffage. And it all climaxes with a terrifically ripping and soaring solo.<br /><br />\\"Born To Lose\\" is another standout in that it is a bluesy, Southern-flavored hard rocker with a big, swinging stoner metal riff, grumbling bass bottom, and fiery, shredding solo that comes piercing through the mix. But to be fair, it kind of pales in comparison to what comes next, \\"Peddlers Of Death,\\" which begins as a bluesy and sad ballad, and switches off between a mournful piano line and fiery, heavy, stomping riff (accented perfectly by some chaotic, shred-soloing). And the tune is also of note for featuring some unorthodox, whammy-bar-laden, and totally air-guitar-able leads, as well. \\"Mother Mary\\" is another big highlight track because it is an anomaly. See, it is a bass-heavy song, with strong, sludgy, grumbling bass lines coursing throughout it. With that said, though, \\"Mother Mary\\" does feature the usual BLS hallmarks, too, including a massive, head-bangable, Pantera-meets-Ozzy Osbourne-esque riff, an insanely catchy, guitar-driven groove, and another blistering solo.<br /><br />Moving along, \\"Beneath The Tree\\" works similarly to the above-described \\"Peddlers Of Death\\" in that is switches back-and-forth between placid balladry and brutal heaviness. The only difference is this song utilizes somber and lightly-plucked acoustic guitars instead of pianos. But back on more familiar ground, \\"Low Down\\" is another moving (and more traditional) piece of sludge/doom metal, and one that is backed by a big, propulsive, staccato -- and, at times, chainsaw-fast -- main riff and some more pyrotechnic solo runs. And \\"T.A.Z.\\" might be called an interlude track, but if so, then it is easily one of the finest interludes in the business. After all, it does find Zakk plucking away, very intricately, speedily, and deftly, on a Spanish-sounding acoustic guitar.<br /><br />Two other highlights include \\"Black Pearl,\\" which offsets soft and restrained verses (that flow and build well into the choruses) with brutal, booming riffage and wah-wah-inflected solos; \\"The Beginning...At Last,\\" a sure-fire effective way to follow-up the piece of gorgeous acoustic balladry that is \\"Spoke In The Wheel.\\" It is a blazing and bludgeoning sludge metaller that drops a really huge, instinctively memorable, and brutal-as-f*** riff slice into the mix, and tacks on a ripping, \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell-worthy solo for good measure. And of course, special mention must also go out to the closing \\"No More Tears,\\" which is centered around a huge, abrasively serrated riff slice and stomping, turgid, grinding groove. And these two things, when coupled together with some wah-wah guitar licks, a really catchy chorus, and a sweeping melodic solo, make \\"Tears\\" one really amazing track, and a possible highpoint of the album.<br /><br />Is \\"Sonic Brew\\" really as brilliant as all that? Darned if it's not close! True, to be perfectly honest and fair, it is not a totally flawless affair, as its production leaves something to be desired (it is strange that Zakk opted for such a raw and low-fi mix this time around, but he did.) But that aside, it would not be overly presumptuous to say that any metalhead should be completely satisfied with \\"S.B.,\\" and find it one heckuva good time!ack, and a possible highpoint of the album.<br /><br />Is \\"Sonic Brew\\" really as brilliant as all that?

B008TRH5N6|4.0|I enjoyed and was pleasantly surprised by the scriptural references to go with the personal examples and the scientific backing
1849163863|5.0|Be sure to read this trilogy from the beginning (The Blackhouse).  Peter May is a master of atmospheric writing -- you'll feel as if you've been hit by the North Sea spray as soon as you start the book.  And he is just as good at creating characters.  This writer is vastly underappreciated.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I got this app because my kindle kept redirecting me to desktop YouTube instead of mobile for some reason. This app is just bad. The interface is slow, ugly, and hard to use. When scrolling it tries to load videos. Changing sound while watching a video is tedious. Not worth the two dollars for premium.
0399159347|5.0|Liane Moriarty has done it again. Just like What Alice Forgot, The Husband's Secret has stayed with me long after finishing it, thinking about what I would do if I were Rachel, Tess or Cecilia. I was riveted for the first half of the book, trying to figure out what the secret was in Cecilia's husband John-Paul's letter. I had multiple guesses and none of them were right. I was shocked when the secret was revealed and was riveted for the second half of the book trying to figure out how in the world it could possibly end in a way that would satisfy me.<br /><br />Ultimately, the ending turned out to be surprising, yet very satisfying. It's hard to go into detail without spoiling the plot. The Husband's Secret would be an awesome book club pick - there is so much to discuss. And I think most women will relate to at least one of the three women in the book and wonder what the heck they would do if put into the same situation as Rachel, Tess or Cecilia. With this book, Ms. Moriarty has earned a spot in my list of favorite authors - I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|These memory cards are fairly extinct at this point. The downfall is with them being so hard to find, they have become very expensive.

B009MYARIK|1.0|Not a likable character in the bunch. everyone was totally self absorbed. i cant even recommend as a breezy beach read.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|Not as scary as most movies in this franchise.  What it is, is a very smooth, glossy addition with a main character who is neither lovable or memorable.  You know something's amiss when the devious android is the most interesting one.  And haven't we seen this movie already, just in a different form?
B00932AA5G|4.0|Another great action flick out of Europe. This has elements of theft, corporate espionage, and plenty of high-tech/high intellect action. This movie has some really excellent plot points and a good twist/synopsis at the end to bring it all together. Some may complain of the quick subtitles making it hard to watch the movie and not just the dialogue. Overall I didn't have a problem with this, but in certain parts it was somewhat difficult. Great movie, great action, and great intellect. If you can read above a 5th grade level, this is definitely a recommended movie to anyone, anywhere (above 18 of course).
B0028NSE3M|2.0|The title track.  I was feeling more nostalgic about this album than it's worth.  I still love Issac Hayes and all he's meant to<br />music, but just download the track for $1.00 on iTunes an be done with it.
1401324649|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this long winded novel, rather like a Forrest Gump story.  It weaves the life experiences of a 100 year old man through important events in history, involving his unexpected participation in it.  The humourous satire, and political comment is well worth wading through the pages.
B00A7OIXW6|3.0|The only reason this gets more than 1 star is because my preschoolers loved it.  Let me qualify that by saying I never would have LET them watch it had I known it had violent content.  For me, the violence in this &#34;children's&#34; film was a little over the top.  You can argue it's cartoon violence, but when you're talking about kiddos who aren't even in kindergarten yet, any violence is too much.  It has a half-decent story, but nothing too terribly compelling.  Mostly it's just a social outcast story peppered with video-game-character-on-video-game-character violence.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|This DVD replaced one I had previously snapped accidentally. The best part about the product is that it worked and hadn't been accidentally snapped by an overzealous person trying to remove it from its case. As for the content...Well, if you like Dr. Who...It is what it says on the cover!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter is only 4 but she loves horses. This game was great! You can see the horse walking through the pasture, feed it, groom it and clean the stable to earn more points to purchase horse clothes or a new horse! The horse is realistic, but she has the opportunity to buy a zebra or unicorn which she finds very exciting! A note of caution: if you do not earn enough coins or stars for a purchase, it will ask the player if you'd like to &#34;buy&#34; it - with real money! We always make sure our purchases are password-protected so there aren't any &#34;oops&#34; key hits!

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I had never heard of this author before, but it was the book club's choice. This book flowed easily and was conversational in tone. I enjoyed the multi view format, which a lot of books seem to be adopting these days.<br /><br />In addition to the format, I loved the story. I could identify with the main character as she went through many emotions from fear and hope,  love and joy.  I generally don't mind predictable plots, but I was pleasantly surprised with the general flow of the book and not knowing what to expect next.<br /><br />I like chick lit and I will be looking into other books by this author.
B00280LYIC|5.0|If you love to read like I do, I read series of books because if I really like the book, I want to read more. There are 4 more books to this series and then there is the spin off called Heroes of Olympus. This is probably the best book I've ever read and there's a movie too, but read the books before you watch it. The books are very well written and full of drama, action, and love! Also, you learn so much from this book about Greek Mythology that it makes you want to know more. I highly recommend this book to anybody and I guarantee you'll love not only The Lightning Thief, but all of the books!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is fun and addicting! It's a fun game to play with your friends near or far! Facebook or not! I suggest this game to kids all ages instead of playing any violent games, they can play a family fun game!

B00AE4OGCU|4.0|Multi layered twists at each turn - I found myself immersed in a world turned on it's head, each book takes the story in unexpected directions before drawing all the strings together in a neatly gift wrapped conclusion.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I like it every single girl can play it! I let my two little cousins play this games so I can go back living my life!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This was a tremendous collection for me. I have not been able to keep up with developments in the series due to familial responsibilities. This put everything together in a convenient package with everything you need to get to the heart of Kojima's vision. If you already have it all through other avenues of release over the years, then it might not serve to get this collection. For me, however, it is perfect!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was one of my book club's selections and it is wonderful.  What a nice surprise to read about real people in this part of the world.  Our news community gives Americans a one-sided view of the Middle East.
B00005A1PR|5.0|My first time buy for India's music.  She sings about life and it's experiences put to a great beat.  Will buy more from her.
B00358ESI4|5.0|A top of the line Vietnam story with very good acting.  From what I understand from some soldiers that were actually there - though some characters were combined/highlighted - a very factual rendition of the first major battle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great little game.  keeps you interested and engaged. be sure to keep a pencil and paper handy to write down clues you encounter along the way.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|No problems. downloading or playing on my Kindle Fire. Fun game and a bit challenging at times. I like it!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|As always with this time period, there is always to much sex. I enjoy the movie but sometimes I think they go overboard with nudity.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|This is the best of the 2 movies hands down. The writing, acting, directing, and comedy were spot on. Everything felt right with this one. I loved all  the extras too. It  made it even more worth the purchase. This was a great buy at a great price.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|I had this in my car for two days before it came apart were it connects at the bottom of my iPhone 5.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I have reached a level where I either wait 30 minutes for more energy or pay for gems. I've been really enjoying this game so far, its challenging without being impossible.<br /> The aiming is spot on (which is a common problem with these games) and its fun to drop many babies at the same time.<br /> I would be willing to pay an upfront fee for this game and fore-go inapp purchases.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome!!!! I recommend it for all despicable me fans!!!!! This game is just like both of the movies and you will love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0143113100|5.0|Extremely informative and educational.  I am facing some medical treatment on my brain in the near future and reading this book made me extremely hopeful.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|No problems what so ever with the product and love the movie.  Those minions really make the movie!  Great for kids and adults.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|ever since I had my 1st smartphone I looked for ebooks to read. this is one of the best places to find free books you can take with you anywhere you go.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Many people had been telling me how great this show is but I don't watch that much TV and didn't take their advice.  Then I saw that I could get it on my Kindle with Amazon Prime and I AM SO ADDICTED TO IT!  Great stories, great characters, great acting and great scenery.  What else could you want?
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Not as good as GF's Gone Girl, but a good read. It did keep me guessing throughout the whole book.
0307352153|5.0|I think this book was well researched, well written, and a very interesting read.  The author is one smart lady.  I have recommended it to multiple friends.<br />It's a wonderful complement to fans of Carl Sagan's &#34;Dragons of Eden&#34;, &#34;Men are from Mars . . . &#34; and other books exploring the nature and personality of people.
B007EECSFA|4.0|The story keeps your attention throughout the entire book.  Full of twists and surprises. I liked that the story was never &#34;predictable&#34;
B004QOB8SO|5.0|What can I say...the friendship between Sherlock and Watson deepens, and so do the odd cases they handle.<br /><br />The Woman comes into the picture in a most shocking way, and Sherlock becomes nearly catatonic....No more!  Watch this great second set of mysteries.  Well worth your time.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|We are very late in getting into this series.  Everyone (friends and grown children) have told us what a great TV show this is and we are trying to catch up.  Seems they were right.
1452110581|5.0|Everyone who has a cat will like this book.  It is very, very cute and very clever.  I can imagine my cat thinking just like this.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved the Harry Potter books and wasn't sure how this story would go.  It was a very interesting story that had some excellent characters.  I may read it again.
B00C5XBAOA|4.0|The figures are realistic and very similar to TV characters. My 4years old doughter likes it very much and enjoys playing with it.
B000274THQ|5.0|An original creation that places you in the middle of the debate between Communism and Capitalism without rhetorical slant. Daniel Brühl portrays the caring son who believes protecting his mothers' fragile health includes recreating her bedroom as the older East Germany, an island to modern day. His mission is honorable and his insight is charming in a film that cannot be categorized (and isn't that great to be able to say?). The narrative is both comedic and sad and portrayed against history in a neighborhood that can't help but fall prey to the modern world. The deeper story line weaves in and out and that heart of the film is strongly and sweetly felt. This German film is on a par with the French film &#34;Amelie&#34; for its ability to make us friends with a young character from childhood to young adult in a personal crisis and aided by the same songwriter/pianist with the perfect touch. Complicated story should be even more enjoyable with a deserved second viewing.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I had a hard copy of the book but lent it to a friend, its a great read for couples!
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This is the kind of film that reminds us why we fell in love with the medium in the beginning.<br />It's exciting, fun, engrossing - an absolute ride from beginning to end.<br /><br />You won't find Citizen Kane here, but if you ever found the genius in films like \\"Back to the Future\\", \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Kill Bill\\" - you will understand why I saw this movie twice in IMAX 3D.<br /><br />Great film, possibly greatest \\"B\\" movie ever.<br /><br />13 year old me would have watched this every day for a year straight, 29 year old me will probably do it as well.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and have a great time watching this beautifully animated Robot VS Monster Battle Royale.
B005PK57IK|5.0|You know, when you try and figure out what makes this show so great, it takes a sec.  It has the basic story line that is solid, and it has the stuff going on right at the edge and such that only adds to the shows interest.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Tends to lose track of the farthest page read.  I always have to set a bookmark manually if I wanted to skip back to a previous chapter.  An unfortunate annoyance in an otherwise solid app.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It's a fun game but I'm to cheap to pay for the whole thing. I'm sure it would be fun to continue but I refuse to pay full price.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I love Johnny Depp in anything, but what I like best about him in The Tourist is that his entire performance is so understated.  The plot is very intelligent and intriguing if you don't require a lot of shoot-em-up wild action.  I bought it because I knew I wanted it in my personal library, and it will remain one of my favorites.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome. I recommend this game for anyone. I like creative mode best. Anyway,  this game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!;)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very addicting game. Graphics are awesome and its fun to play. I would recommend<br />if you like to have fun.
0375701427|5.0|Some of the finest lines I've ever read, truly lyrical. I have read 7 or 8 Roth novels, and this and I Married a Communist are his best.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|This is a good movie.  But beware, just like the 1st Lord of the Rings movie, it ends before the main plot is fulfilled and you have to wait however long until part 2 comes out.  By then I will likely have forgotten most of the movie.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|I bought this for my daughter for our long road trip.  It was great!  She expanded the fun by adding the cling-stickers to the windows.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome app for the entire family! its hours of fun! log onto youtube if you have trouble getting minion matches for bonus stuff
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a fun game. But, it can get costly to advance. You have to purchase certain things. Parents should monitor or turn off purchasing.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is the best game ever when I was smaller I used to play it on the computer almost everyday. LoL Laugh Out Loud
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is a great variation on the hidden object game genre. Enough variety to keep it from feeling too repetitive.  The voice acting is a little lame, but that's part of the fun.
B00005JKJA|1.0|The first half of the movie was entertaining enough to keep you watching for the expected ending. What you get in the second half of the movie was a mélange of pseudo- intellectual &#34;art&#34; that makes you sorry that you ever even heard of this movie. The only reason I give it one star is for Naomi Watts' performance in the first half of the film. Unfortunately, even her talent couldn't rescue this waste of film.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is not just for women. It is a show you can watch with you wife that both of you will enjoy.
B00CRMX53S|4.0|A little repetitive but still really catchy. It sticks in your head for a long time. Way to go Daft Punk for making it on the pop scene for Summer 2013.
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|The movie quickly dispenses with the remnants of the old movie and gets on with being an fun action story, with some nice little nods to classic G.I. Joe iconography and toys.
0679642609|5.0|I've had many similar insights towards life, thus I couldn't help but smile when he would declare something I had previously thought of. Great translation.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have watched all 3 seasons on Downton Abbey.  From the first episode of season 1, I was hooked.  This show has all the excitement and drama for class television.  I can hardly wait for season 4.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I love Emma Stone, and this is one of my favorite movies with her. Super funny, touching and identifiable. The entire cast does a fantastic job... Love Stanley Tucci in this as well.
B008DGC06A|5.0|Albume of the summer! Get this now or miss her when she stops in your town.<br />Great early morning record!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I was fascinated with this story.  I've always taken an interest in WWII stories, but having never read anything from a pilots perspective, I've never learned to appreciate the \\"view from the sky.\\"  There are so many things I never knew or understood about the war, and I was shocked at how many misconceptions I had about the Germans.  The camaraderie forged during that time, as told in this book, is heartwarming.  Makes you remember that all those soldiers on BOTH sides really do have hearts, and just how real war is for those who are in the middle of it.
B003VA3JUO|4.0|I have seen this movie several times. I bought a new copy of it since I lost my old copy. My favorite character in the movie is the ghost of the little girl. She is a good soul who tries to help the crew to survive. I also just bought a new home theater sustem so I wanted to watch Ghost Ship on it. I love the movie every time I see it.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Scotty Mc Creery Clear As Day is beautiful. I borrowed it from a local library and couldn't wait to buy a copy.
B005IU1OMA|4.0|I bought this for my husband, to get him pumped for going snowboarding. It is 2 discs, one is the regular DVD and the other is just the Blue-ray version of the same video. I do not really understand what makes the collectors edition so special. If I would have known I would have just bought the blue-ray.
B007HO392S|5.0|I was &#34;Blown Away&#34;-great CD. This is my first Carrie Underwood purchase and it won't be the last! Very impressed.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Good story and affects. Fun to watch on the big screen and it kept your interest. I recommend it to all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for adults and kids! My grandkids and daughter like to play as much as I do.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Typical Bruce Willis action. It was fun with his wise guy humor but some of the stunts were over the top.
1608871517|5.0|Beautifully written and presented! All I expected to find in this book, and more. I was deeply touched by the respect the author shows for the man who made his career possible, as he states. No morbidity, no second guessing, just the facts as he lived them and remembers them. Highly educative for fashion and entertainment professionals too.
B009CF7GRY|1.0|I had to force myself to continue watching after the incredibly cheesy opening credits intro.  It was hard to get past that, but I tried, unsuccessfully.  I don't think I made it 20 minutes in.  Bad acting, horrible music, cheesy at best.  If you love the original Footloose (as I do), then don't watch this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There's a reason this saga is becoming a classic. Forget about vampires, werewolves and Game of Thrones dragons. The WOOL OMNIBUS is un-put-down-able suspenseful fiction, and all the more compelling because it has the real world feel of something that could actually happen, no matter how sci-fi this dystopian story might pretend to be. You get three guesses as to who destroyed the world and left its survivors living in an underground bunker, but you'll only need one, because the seeds of that kind of destruction exist right now in this very real world of ours. I'll be thinking worried thoughts from here on out.
B00932A4XE|3.0|Cute, and entertaining.  Nothing to write home about, but I enjoyed watching and even laughed out loud a few times.  Definitely a &#34;chick-flick&#34;
B000GRUMPU|5.0|We all loved the movie.  It is better than the original!<br />Our family has watched it several times already.  Without the profanity, it would have been perfect, indeed!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and my granddaughter to.if you could make one of the world tours Cuba we would all thank you.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is pretty cool, it's free to play but you have to pay for the extras. I've found that I don't really need anything extra though.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We now watch more youtube videos on the large screen . Has made search easy from the PC and cast the right video to the TV.<br />This was a pain with the native apps on the TV
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this game! It is free anyways, so you don't have to worry about it not being worth the money! It only froze up on me once!
B007SGM084|5.0|Simply put....unable to put it down ! I did not want the story to ever end, would appreciate the movie very much !
B005ERYEGU|5.0|We do a lot of outbound selling within my business but I just felt we were not getting the results we wanted. Since reading the book our sales have almost doubled! Loads of great strategies on how to really get your out bound sales performing. Thanks Aaron.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was delightful!! Very detailed too. I would definitelyrecommend this book! What the heck is wrong with my kindle??
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was beautifully told story about life in Afghanistan that is interesting to learn. Very good characters and written in an unique style that kept your interest throughout.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Addictive game five stars without a doubt I haven't been able to put the game down definitely a must have
B008OOYALE|4.0|I really like this game. The social part is better than most games on the kindle and adds aren't a problem. The only issue I have is the cluttered appearance from the bazillion dragons crammed like sardines in the small island spaces. Otherwise fun game esp. when breeding two dragons and seeing what you get!
B00BMBA2CC|5.0|This was is a great CD.  It has an 80's vibe but much cooler.  Her lyrics are much better than simple pop stuff.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I really enjoyed watching Downton Abbey this season, but disappointed that two main characters died. It was also just a little boring this season, but I still liked it and will continue to watch it in January.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|This is one of the best-written books I've read in many years.  I read a lot of crime fiction, a genre where you overlook a lot of mediocre to terrible writing because you've been sucked in by the plot.  A Kiss Before Dying has an ingenious plot plus writing by an absolute master of the craft.  Ira Levin employs the device of an unreliable narrator so adroitly in this book that I was dramatically startled several times.  He doesn't employ red herrings or cheap tricks - the surprises are all caused by great writing.  I can't recommend this book enough.  It's one I'll re-read many times.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|watched this the other nite and cried at the end. will be watching this again this week. thank you .
1451613512|5.0|Regardless of where your beliefs place you on the political spectrum, and regardless of what your opinion is of Oliver Stone, you should read \\"The Untold History of the United States.\\" Yes, it's biased (what book isn't these days?), and yes, it probably goes too far in placing most of the blame for many of the world's most serious problems on the United States. But just because the authors clearly have an agenda does not mean that much of what they say is not true. And their agenda is strikingly non-partisan--they bash Johnson, Clinton and Obama for their domestic and foreign policies just as much as they do Nixon, Reagan and Bush. Working your way through the 600+ pages of text requires committing your time, your energy and, most of all, your critical analytical skills to the process. In the end, if you stick with it, you'll gain a very good understanding of why so many people in the world hate the United States.<br /><br />There's no denying that U.S. arrogance, attitudes and actions throughout the world have done much to alienate many nations over the years. There's no denying that the U.S. has been guilty of manipulating the internal affairs of other sovereign states to its economic benefit, and usually to the detriment of indigenous populations. There's no denying that the CIA has run roughshod over basic human rights in its operations overseas, just as there's no denying that the FBI, NSA, TSA and many other government entities are doing so today in the homeland. But most of the global and domestic problems that authors Stone and Kuznick describe, and for which they hold U.S. policies largely responsible, are far more complicated than they would have you believe. Several times as I read the book I thought, \\"Now wait just a minute here, it's not that simple.\\" That's where critical analytical skills come in handy.<br /><br />\\"The Untold History of the United States\\" is a compellingly readable, painstakingly documented, often disturbing view of how America's economic, military and political self-interests have shaped global relationships for decades. As such, it is a thought-provoking counterweight to the far more common \\"conventional\\" views of world history. Some readers may believe the U.S. has never done anything wrong, and has always acted reasonably and responsibly. Others may feel Stone and Kuznick have not gone far enough in placing the blame for the world's problems on \\"American imperialists.\\" In my opinion, the truth, which no one will ever know for sure anyway, most likely lies somewhere in between. If \\"The Untold History of the United States\\" does nothing more than illuminate U.S. attitudes and actions that, even if exaggerated, should infuriate every American, it will have served a very useful purpose. I recommend it highly.omic, military and political self-interests have shaped global relationships for decades.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was really surprised at how roomy the backpack was.  This backpack served our needs and more.  We would recommend it to our friends and other camera enthusiasts
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I strongly recommend this series for people who like sci-fi novels or apocalyptic stories or anything futuristic. Great use of mystery and relationships and different characters.

1416972250|5.0|Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments series truely does leave you craving for more! I just could not put the book down, but could not read it fast enough to find out what happens next. This third installment, City of Glass, does not disappoint fans of the first two!!<br /><br />First, let me say that I adore the stories like Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Percy Jackson, Twilight, Fallen, Heroes of Olympus, Kane Chronicles... The way that these authors create a world situated within our real one, but hidden and special. I adore the the strength and vulnerablity of their characters, which are written in such a way you genuinely feel like they're a part of your life. Because of my love - and constant re-reading of all those series - a friend suggested Cassandra Clare. I looked around and finally bought the first book in her first series, City of Bones. From the first page, I was hooked.<br /><br />All of the things that captivated me from J.K. Rowling's first few sentences, Rick Riordian's first words, Lauren Kate's first chapter... it's all there but intensified. The power and love, the secretive world that blends seamlessly into ours, the mystery and struggles, the characters with their lovable flaws and incredible strengths... I personally can't help but fall in love with each characters' beauty and courage, their stubborness and passion. And I couldn't turn the pages fast enough! From the first few words, I felt like I was with Clary on this mind blowing journey, discovering the Shadow World with her, learning its magical ways and all the secrets it holds. The twists and turns surprised me, held me and drove me to support these amazing kids in their adventure. Cassandra Clare justs has a way of painting these amazing stories, like you're watching the whole tale unfold in front of you, like these are people you really care about or passionately despise.<br /><br />There are great stories and great authors, but very few can claim to be both. Cassandra Clare and her Cityof Glass is by far one of those few. After picking up this story, the only regret you'll have is that you have to wait quite a while for the 6th and final installment!
1781162646|5.0|I've always been a huge fan of everything Stephen King.  With that being said I certainly was not disappointed by Joyland.  Joyland was a huge treat.  It was so different  from his normal macabre (which I've always loved).  He developed the characters, as he always does, in a way that we that we relate to.  We come to know them all intimately, they become our friends.  I strongly recommend Joyland.  It's a fun ride!

B008NA2JMQ|5.0|Well written, a good story and a fascinating life. Excess, excess, excess! Well worth the reading time. Will defo read the sequel now.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|I bought this to replace a full body case I had bought previously.  I wanted to go with just a bumper to help dissipate the heat when using the wireless charger.  The buttons work through the bumper, can't even tell the bumper is there.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have used this on my smart phone for several months with the greatest satisfaction. Now I am trying it on my android tablet. So far it is just a functional and enjoyable. I love being able to switch back and forth between translations of which there are many available. I would recommend this app to anyone.
0345803507|5.0|I read this as soon as it arrived.  Phew!!  A very interesting read.  The book arrived in excellent condition and in record time.  Thank you
B00E38KGF4|5.0|Download and initial scan on my android tablet went exceptionally well. The program works like I would expect it to. Only time will tell if it truly protects or not. The Bitdefender brand is an excellent one.
1401322786|5.0|Had to read this as soon as it arrived.  Very interesting book!  It arrived in record time and in very good condition.  Thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game was great but then it updated and I have not been able to play it since. Don't know what happened but would really like to play again.
B00CATSONE|2.0|Not the best book on the subject, try another. The price was right and that was the best thing about it.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|WELL MADE AND THE PRICE IS GREAT COMPARED TO THE PRICES IN THE STORES. IT IS ALL THAT I EXPECTED
B009M7G1PU|1.0|I am still confused over the rave about this book.  Although, I felt the same way after reading the Shade of Grey series.  Got boring very fast!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this show. The acting is superb and the setting and time period make it so enjoyable. Season two was just as good as season 1.
B0061S0A64|4.0|This is a pretty cool app, especially as a free app of the day.  The user drags lights to a field and begins a percussional rhythm.  The rhythm can either be static or changing.  There's a keyboard in the background to accompany it.  It's kind of digital new age free form.  If they had a version that could change genres I would pay money for it.
B008M0NDOK|3.0|This controller would be 5 stars if it had Modern Combat 4.  Very limited list of games.  Too bad.  Connects to my iphone 4s and ipad 2 easily
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I loved the action in this book, and there was never a dull moment. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Good for all those that love a good action some-what paranormal book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun fast and my whole family likes to play the game! Great for all ages I tell all my friends to get it!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|All the fun of Temple Run 2, but way more variety. Tons and tons of fun for all ages. Hard to put down.
B005FISBTO|3.0|The writing has defiantly gotten worse. Michael C Hall and Jennifer Carpernter are still amazing as usual and are probably the only reason I am still watching
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It needs some instructions to tell the user what each of the sharpening sides does, i had to google that part. After i figured that out it works perfectly, sharpest knives i have ever had.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This looks like a fun game. I can't tell because it just loads and loads and loads. I have never been able to play it....
B000002JSN|5.0|I'm not worthy to rate this kind of thing.  The masters are here and you can hear them anytime you like.  So many works of art for your ears.  Let me finish with this: once a smart@ss asked me as kind of a way to goad, &#34;what is the meaning of life?&#34;  My answer, &#34;that's easy.  Led Zeppelin.&#34;  He was stumped.  And this guy is a hard case of a mouthy piece of work.  Stumping the maestro with the mighty Led Zep was a sweet feeling I revisit often.  What can anyone say that hasn't already been said?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome this is a must have for all minion fans. it suits all ages its so fun
B00847KFDS|5.0|I have been a devout Fogerty and CCR fan since the early 80's.  I wasn't sure how I would feel about tweaking the old classics.  I thought they were all great except the song with Miranda Lambert.  I like her solo albums though.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|We really like to play this game as a family. Good quest game with training sequences and battles.<br />Neat images from the movie too. Good graphics and sound.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|seriously one of the funnest games i have played ever! i would suggest it to anyone. it's never the same course, its sometimes difficult and fun. keeps you on your toes.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this game is soooooo cool you get to dress up. a press and do a make up cool and hair
0521173787|4.0|Actually I liked this book because it helped me to raise my IELTS score. Unfortunately I didn't realize that this book missing the CD for the listening section.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I see a lot of comments that Chromecast did not work on the Samsung $249 WiFi Chromebook.  It worked fine for me without a hitch.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I wish there were more adventure games like this one. I'm not a big fan of hidden image gangs but I like that you can skip them our get hints. Overall worth the price.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Just another great album from Buddy Guy.  Everyone who has any of his albums must add this one to their collection.  If one is just starting out collecting, this is a must add.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|yes game is very wordy but over all I enjoy these types of games. So I just clicked through the talking.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Great Transaction,  No Problems  A++<br />A very good CD for anyone to own<br />One of the greatest groups ever<br />Recommended
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game is very addictive, can't stop playing it. Keeps you mind going, sometimes I needed to cheat on certain floors. I highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like it. It is fun and addictive, fast paced. Would recommend for any age. As aforementioned, you'll go BANANAS playing it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very addictive, can't stop playing it. Keeps you mind going, sometimes I needed to cheat on certain floors. I highly recommend it.
159514188X|4.0|Pretty consistently entertaining all the waythrough. She would reccomend this to other 17 yr olds. Did not put this down until finished.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Maggie Smith is superb in her role. The entire cast is gifted.  I can't wait for Season 4. Jolly good fun.
0142418471|4.0|My daughter liked this book but not the ending - She thougt the ending dcould have been better. She is 17.
B000W4KSWO|5.0|While playing the vinyl at dinner, my mother-in-law commented she needed music like this.... Apparently, this classic is on repeat now!
0142412147|5.0|She enjoyed all three stories and requested more John Green. My daughter reads a lot and this was one of her favorites for 2013.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|First off, i love this game.  Only reason i gave this 3 stars is because of the multiplayer mode.  Bluetooth range only???  Well I guess no multiplayer for me.  Damn you misleading promises!!
B005PK57NU|5.0|This show keeps getting better with each season. I love the character development that ties in perfectly with the various cases the attorneys are working on.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I love this game.  I have regular Star girl app, but this is better.  Has fun clothes, more stores and cooler look.  I love the rock n roll store!  If you have star girl you will like this version, if never played this game is totally cute and fun.<br /><br />Add me 4E3CM, puhlease..<br /><br />8/10/13 Noticed if have both Star Girls, you have two avatars but one account.  Your friends carry over so start off in Moda Italia with advantage.  TIP:  don't sync the two accounts, I almost did that and deleted my regular Star Girl progress.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game challenging as you go up in levels. I love hidden object games and this game is exciting and fun to play. I will recommend it to friends.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Great visuals, good action and suspense, but too many &#34;what the?&#34; moments when trying to understand the plot line.  Suspend reality and enjoy the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is hours of fun. love my minion run rush.they are cute to watch and listen to. cant get enough bananas ....
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I think that is amazing group and very excellent songs, im so excited for the tour, my favorite is True and IAWLT.
B00632HWOG|1.0|It's constantly kicking me out, making me change my password.  When I assign a contact to a list, it may or may not stick - sometimes I get contacts telling me they haven't heard from me for awhile and when I go to look, they have dropped off the list for no reason.  It's slow, and it just generally sucks.  I do NOT recommend this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game for me as well very fast paced and adjustable difficulties for different ages I have this on all my devices
B003MAQM6Q|5.0|If you're a guy and can't quote this movie, you have failed your gender. :) Good action, great psychological thriller, with some pro-man propaganda thrown in...
B009AMAGQM|2.0|Ok, I totally understand that it's hard to make a movie as good as the book, in fact its often nearly impossible. But, I have read many other books and watched the subsequent movie after. They really could have done better. I honestly didn't care too much for the movie, but the book was pretty good. There were just too many characters left out and details that were either combined, altered, or left out all together. It was truly disappointing. Harry Potter, Twilight, How To Deal (book: someone like you), Speak, etc. These are examples of books that had decent movies made after them. And I have to admit, I was curious how to pronounce Macon's full name from the book because Amma called him by his full name...not once did she say it in the movie...the sisters would have been a nice comic relief, and Boo Radley would have been neat....how hard would it have been to get a big dog?!? As I said, just too much missing. I was so excited to see the movie...but honestly, if I saw the movie first, I don't think I would have made it through the 500 and some odd pages of the book. Then again, the book ruined the movie too. IF they make another (which I doubt seeing as this was so bad) they really need to step it up. I would watch a 2.5-3 hour movie just to get better details.
B003RNVNCQ|5.0|another fine album from mike oldfield great for listening to if you love insturmental pieces that have more than just the classic insturments
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A bit challenging but enjoyable. Keeps the mind going. Love it is free.. free is good. I m going to keep on
B008S68ZTG|5.0|another fine album from mike oldfield great for listening to if you love insturmental pieces that have more than just the classic insturments
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME! It's fun winning a game of uno against real people instead of programmed robots. It's also great that i can connect to Facebook and play against my friends
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I was quite surprised with this new material by BS as I was hoping for a more Vol.4 feel but the more I listen to this CD, the more I hear some of their younger albums all mixed in to one &#34;13&#34;. The more I listen to this, the more I appreciate it !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I need to start dodging the trains better. I really like getting new character's. I wish they would make one on bunnies. They could get the carrots and try to dodge the garden gnomes. And in the beginning they would eat the veggies in the garden and be chased by a ma gardner and his cat.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best mobile movie themed app. the graphics are great the fun amazing. i reccomend tis to all ages maybe not infant.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Not bad for traditional search and find with some puzzle twists.  The voices are nice addition.  T he story flows pretty well.  Enjoyable.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie had me thinking about all the contraptions and inventions I could create around the house to keep the \\"bad guys\\" at bay. The amount of adventure, suspense and laughter this movie generated was extraordinary!!!!
B00908DDZM|5.0|I loved the beat, but was caught aback with the graphic language . After I listened to the lyrics, I realized the album packed a big punch on social awareness. Not for the faint of heart.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly has developed a gorgeous and responsive framework to replace Google Reader. The UI is intuitive and quick, and the company's responsiveness to user desires is nothing short of first-rate.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great app for anyone who wants just a quick glance or a full forecast. I love that I can save different locations. That function saved me while I was on vacation.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|The Wikipedia app lets me look really smart in front of my friends without me having to learn or remember anything. Plus it doesn't have those creepy ads asking for donations like the Wikipedia web page does.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This. Game. Fun. Ya. Thanks. Good. Game. For. Everyone. To. Play. And. Great. Game. For. Kids. And. Adults. To. Play.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I love all the bourne movies and ths was the only one we didnt have. a great drama!!! I also love maat damon the actor!
B005PK57IK|5.0|The Good Wife is a show with a poor title, but it makes up for it with great storylines, interesting characters, and plot twists that will keep you coming back.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|Wish I had read the reviews BEFORE I bought it. Like everyone who has the HD the part needed for the record is behind the menu button preventing you from going any further. IF YOU HAVE A KINDLE HD DON'T BUY IT.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It's so easy to use even my 4 year old can play my 2 year old needs a little help but fun for everyone
B000MAH5O2|3.0|I am a supporter of President Obama and campaigned for him but was disappointed in the book.  I read it but wanted more insight into his personality.  Too cautious.....
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|This movie is directed so great.  I would buy many many more.  I love the whole story plot.  Great movie and very well acted drama
B007R21JJK|4.0|That's because \\"some\\" 3rd-party software programs have still not ironed-out all the bugs of a 64-bit programming structure, and they can sometimes be somewhat quirky. But this is becomming much less of an issue as time goes on.
B0052BZ6X8|5.0|Great movie!  Kept me on the edge of my seat!  Great outcome as well!  Highly recommended for anyone who likes action.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game on the kindle I would definitely buy it.It does not cost that much as the Xbox or the computer.so I say get it.I've had this game for 2 years
B005LAII4E|5.0|very good product and excellent quality. the price was the best, I recommend it to everyone. do not hesitate to buy it.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Just came I today and its great. Amazing detail in the costume, weapon, and it looks like Jennifer Lawrence. It comes with a little stand but I don't wanna take it out of the box. It does not disappoint.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Sometimes the items don't stick to the items and I Hate when I can't figure something out even with the help. But it is fun when you get through a level and the visual is good.
140006922X|5.0|Just finished the book and I thought is was an extremely interesting, and very readable, biography about one of the most important people who ever lived. The book strips away, bit by bit, much of the myth and superstition that has slowly accumulated around Jesus the Christ. Jesus of Nazareth, it is revealed, is a much different person than the one we think we all know. Aslan does a superb job building his case - with mountains of historical evidence, primary and secondary sources, logic, and persuasive argument - that the historic Jesus was much more human, believable, and interesting than you may have thought. Excellent for believers, nonbelievers, and everyone in between. A necessary read for everyone.
B0089XH38M|1.0|everytime It finds a threat, it freezes and I have to restart the app. It may be awesome on a phone but garbage on the kindle fire!
1476733953|4.0|Book 1 (the story of Sheriff Holston) grabbed me pretty quickly and I found this all pretty engaging, with a sense of slowly unraveling mystery throughout.  I felt as the books went on, and became longer, they became a little less tight, but overall still good.  The writing is adequate, not great but not bad either, especially by the standards of self-published sci-fi this is really pretty good quality.  Nothing remarkable about the language or imagery or dialogue, but gets the job done.  I did find that I had anticipated most of the big \\"reveals\\" but nonetheless it was interesting to see how it all plays out, and I will most likely continue reading the sequels.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|A great investment to your 3D library!  Great picture quality.  Includes the DVD version. I would highly recommend this movie.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Great book but I do not recommend it to the younger kids. It's a tough book about a boy who has a deformed face.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Chewy, illuminating, crunchy, colorful descriptions of some of the most dastardly behaviors in history. I could not stop reading till done. Oh yes, and a love story or two.
B001PCOSW8|4.0|Most people know about Europe from their mega hit The Final Countdown, but before that they were a straightforward metal band. Their debut is solid and features the best song they have ever written in my opinion, Seven Doors Hotel! This song is simply magical. John Norum is in top form and Tempest's vocals are superb.  Other classics are In the Future to Come, Farewell, the instrumental Boyazont, and the excellent ballad Words of Wisdom. I love how Norum really digs in with his pick and his playing drips with emotion. A classic album hidden in the misty forests of Sweden.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy this game. It is fun to play with children or if you are bored and just wasting some time.
0451219597|5.0|Man, I love Ken Follett.  His wartime novels are always so good.  Here, he introduces a fantastic female lead in Flick Clairet.  She's interesting, flawed, courageous, and brilliant.  She and her female squad named the Jackdaws set out on an impossible mission to help the Allies during WWII.  The book is laced with real history and is an example of great storytelling.  Overall, a great read.
B008JFUO36|2.0|Oblivion is a mashup of several science fiction movies.  Tom Cruise is the same old Tom Cruise.  I'm going to go reread some classic science fiction now since  it is far more imaginative than this movie.
B007IX383I|5.0|Anathema are a band that continue to put out some of the best progressive rock being delivered by anyone today.  \\"Weather Systems\\" ranks right up with the band's best and is another fine addition to their catalogue.  On this one the band use more orchestration than in the past which gives the overall presentation a fuller more sonically rich sound.  The music is sublime, the vocals soaring and the songwriting strong.  Many people that I know thought the band's last album was their masterpiece, but I actually think I like this one better.  Anathema have truly progressed over the years into a powerful musical force.  I can't imagine that fans of melodic progressive rock would not totally dig this album.
B001I82RVS|5.0|I thought it was funny and really entertaining. Wish it was cheaper for the dubbed version but great overall. 5 stars
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|this movie was very well made there are several things happening at the same time and at different time very long movie but thats good if u want to build your characters this movie was worth it a must in 3d collection can't wait for the next one to come out.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Ok so I am a huge Tarantino  fan.  And this movie does not disappoint.  The story line is fantastic.  It really is worth the watch.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|i'm not one to give anything away about this movie,but it was more then i expected ....well worth getting good story
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I thought it was okay, but just really drawn out.  I did not know that it was not going to have an ending and to be continued into a second movie.  To be honest I did not see the whole thing, I fell asleep, but my 11yr old really really liked it.  He has not seen any of the Lord of the Rings yet .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the speacial abilities people have and using emeralds to resserect yourself  unlimited times until you run out.  I haven't bought ANY emeralds using money and I have 75 of them! And in 3 days!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I am used to the Facebook app having issues on my phone but I was hoping this was a better. It worked the first time I downloaded the app but now crashes every time I open it. I have loaded it three times with the same result. PLEASE FIX IT!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a fun game. it is entertaining for when there is a need to waste time but I caution you. it does actually become addicting.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|i look forward to where this show is going, as it has been on for a while.  of course margulies is fantastic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book ; couldn't put it down! Now I am anxious to read third book in this trilogy! Would recommend for everyone!
B00A4AIYHW|5.0|I like it better than big Boo because it is pocket size. Kids love it and it is so cute!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a very very excellent game. I love playing this game. I totally recommend this game to any one who loves games like this.
006178480X|3.0|Typical Rollin's fare.  Good mindless action by comic book type characters.  I guess the thing that bothers me about Rollin's books are that he takes a scientific term and bends it out of all reality.  Dark energy is a major factor in the structure of the universe, especially at galactic distances.  It is poorly understood but doesn't effect comets or asteroids in the solar system.  The passage of a comet also doesn't fling asteroids or \\"meteors\\" at earth.  It's good mindless entertainment, but his science is not science.  It's more like the magical spells of Harry Potter.
B003ZHVJFA|3.0|A different spin on the Tekken story line not horrible but far from . Impressed with some of the picks for some characters(Carey-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Heihachi, Jon Foo as Jin, and Kelly Overton as Christie), but disappointed in development of main and side characters. Definitely let down in the script, but this movie had potential. Reminded me of the the second Mortal Kombat.
B005JABU82|5.0|Like all of Bandai's Real Grade series kits, this kit is 1/144 scale. It stands about 6\\" tall, but there is an absurd amount of detail contained in those few inches. There are plenty of pane lining opportunities throughout the kit, and the excellent color separation means painting is completely unnecessary. Unlike the RG RX-78-2, there are no stickers on the back of the knee to fall off, however the Freedom does have the annoying elbow stickers. I suspect by their design, they'll stay on a bit better on the Freedom than they did on the RX-78-2.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Extremely detailed with excellent color separation<br />Excellent design<br />Very poseable; all joints are fully articulated, even multi-jointed fingers.<br />I like the inclusion of swappable HG-style hands in addition to the standard shrunk-MG style RG hands. No more lost fingers.<br />Tiny parts. Be ready with a magnifying glass during assembly.<br /><br />Cons:<br />With the gigantic wings, its extremely back heavy and hard to pose. Completely nullified with an Action Base 2.<br />After lots of repositioning, the arms begin to droop from the weight of the weapons, slightly limiting the posing abilities.<br />Tiny parts. Be ready with a magnifying glass during assembly.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I enjoyed the book, so much so that I couldn't put it down.  Lee Child was able to hold my attention into earlier mornings of reading and to the end of the book.
B008602KQI|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a while. Reminded me of The Running Man by Stephen King as Richard Bachman. The big difference is in this movie they are trying to keep from being killed by each other. In The Running Man, he's trying to keep from being killed by the hunters. Similar premise....equally as good.
B000OCXI3K|4.0|Of course most books are better than the movie so that is no surprise, but I really enjoyed the writing and flow of the book as well as the little details the movie did not touch upon.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I wasn't sure where the first book would lead too in the second, so I'm glad it came out better than I could of imagined! Can't wait to read the third!
0375851569|5.0|These are the more popluar beginner books. My children ages 6-8 can read them by theirselves with little to no help.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Didn't realize it was going to be so explicit, but enjoyed it once I got used to the descriptiveness of their encounters. Great book! Excited to read the other two!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very well made app and a must have for your Kindle Fire HD. Looks great, works great, great price. :)<br /><br />I use it all the time, so I personally couldn't use my Kindle effectively without it.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Downloaded this game to entertain my kids, but I have logged a few hours playing it as well, good, simple fun.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Highly recommended for fans of the series. A real page turner for sure. One of my all time favorite characters.
0345529057|5.0|Incredible story. No wonder the TV show is so engrossing, it has an awesome source. I'm very glad Mr. Martin opted against a movie; all the richness of the story and character development would have been edited out.<br /><br />No complaints about the mass-market format, unless you're planning on keeping the books in mint-condition while reading- that's impossible. This format is destined to be worn down while reading.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|my wife liked it and I watch it with her and she wanted to bye it when it came out,so Idid.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie, and having it readily available on my kindle makes for a good time whenever she has the desire to watch the movie, no matter where we are !
B00CFA222M|1.0|If you want to see some giant pick his nose and eat it you will love this movie,but if you dont save your money
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The games interesting,I love all the challenges.Once you start you get so interested that you can't stop playing. It's almost the same version as Temple Run but way better.
0060555661|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic. It's a very deep read for those that aren't really in tune with investing and general terms. However if you grab a couple friends to talk with about it you will learn so much from this book.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As usual, Nicholas Sparks :-) created a very intriguing novel. I could not put it down. I was so upset when it was over because I had become so involved with the characters. I am anxious for Sparks' next creation!  I have just read this touching book again and enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time!! What a wonderful love story!!
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Probably not much else to say that hasn't already been said, but to me this book presents like a collection of short stories that present as a whole to give a complete picture of the event. Despite the fact that the author has clearly considered the event from multiple viewpoints and has constructed numerous accounts (each of which would have had to involve an incredible amount of research), the quality in the delivery means that there is as much intrigue in the things that aren't said as there is in the things that are, thanks to the way your imagination is absorbed into the narrative.<br />I must say that I do not intend on seeing the film as I cannot see how anything could trump the experience of reading this book. Bravo Max.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I think this book was interesting although Jeff Albom's  non-fiction  books are generally more enjoyable to me.  Our book club did have an excellent and lengthy discussion of the book, which made me appreciate it more. I felt that a lot of the book was  was repetitive and obvious, but aside from that, its themes were universal.
B001684L0A|5.0|Giamatti is excellent as Adams.  The atmosphere is remarkably well done and pulls you into the time period to provide an incredible recap on the foundation of our country.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|If you like spies, war stories, interesting characters, and suspense, like I do, then you will like this book. In my opinion this is a well written book with all those qualities.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I love playing this game but it starts to get boring after having to start over after every 10 days I think they should have if so you could buy work up in the world like start with a cheep boat and bad house and you work your way up in the world. But so far it is really fun to play and pass time. I say get it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Entertaining and worth watching! Not wanting in the intrigue department, and love Hiclere Castle and the old cars!<br /><br />WELL WORTH WATCHING!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This album is fantastic, if you're a fan of QOTSA. I would recommend to anyone, but it does take a few spins to really get it. If you're new to the band you might not get at all. I would suggest going back and listening to Songs for the Deaf or Rated R and then coming back to this one if you aren't already a fan. That said, all of the songs are great, both epic and personal at the same time, especially I Appear Missing, quickly becoming one of my favorite songs, let alone one my favorite Queens songs. Fairweather Friends is also very good and has an appearance from Sir Elton John. They guy knows a good band when he hears one. Highly recommended.
0345803485|5.0|I bought all three books. It is a very interesting book. It was fascinating to read about a very different life style.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Every so often you will see ads for CtR toys. Is a fun game. 5 stars. Just way too many ads for a paid app.
0345803493|5.0|Bought all of the books in the set. It is a very interesting series. It's not my lifestyle, but very interesting to read about it.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I started reading this book and noticed how it jumped around from place to place, unannounced.  By the end of the book I just wanted it to end.  Overall, interesting story and world, with unmemorable characters.
0345803507|5.0|Bought the Trilogy. The books kept my attention from start to finish. It's not my lifestyle, but very interesting to read about it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great book.  Never seems to get boring and leaves you at a very dramatic and cliffhanger ending for almost all the characters.  Anyone who has read previous books in the series will realize that his writing is dynamic and plot twists are some of the most dramatic in the history of the genre.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was so excited to get this that I was even willing to wait for the slight backorder on Amazon.<br /><br />I got it today. I plugged it in to my tv. It looked cool.<br />It said to use a phone or tablet to connect, so I pull out my iPhone and go to their website.<br />All was working smoothly until it gets to the step where it says my WiFi Password is wrong. It isn't wrong.<br />I click &#34;try again&#34;. It tries again for 3-5 minutes, then resets itself.<br /><br />I called Google support. They naturally blamed it on my router.<br />I called Comcast support. They naturally said &#34;I dont know, would you like to pay for advanced tech support?&#34;<br />I had them turn off the built-in router on my modem.<br />I plugged in my known-good router that I have complete control over.<br />I tried again. SAME STUPID FAILURE.<br />I called Google support again. The B* on the phone literally had the stupidity/nerve to tell me &#34;It doesn't work with iOS yet.&#34;<br />So I informed her that going to the setup website it said it works with my web browser regardless of device.<br />She again repeated that it doesn't work with iOS. I said, &#34;okay, then what do you suggest I do&#34;?<br />Google B*: &#34;You should buy an android device&#34;<br />Then I hung up the phone and wrote this review. Now I will return this piece of junk.<br /><br />Dear Google, if you're listening, you were better off when you didn't have a phone number. At least then I thought your employees were too smart to help. Now I know they're too dumb.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This book is great in every aspect.  I enjoy the writers style as the character progresses and how the character asks the simple questions and works his way to the more complex one.  Overall, the smarter you are the more problems your going to have.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Okay, I never read the series so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I saw the 2nd installment (Sea of Monsters) via a sneak peek so I HAD to ensure I saw the first movie.  I really enjoyed The Lightning Thief and the story line.  Maybe it isn't Oscar material but I was entertained and enjoyed this movie!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|I read this book as extra credit for a philosophy class and loved it.  It really alters your view on how people live.  And shows you how they live their lives pleasing one person after another, while never doing anything for themselves.  This book will help you open your eyes to the world around you and motivate you to try to reach your full potential.  Great read, great story, motivational material.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After hearing about it so much I finally read it.  Done in two days.  Looking forward to the other books.  Might actually watch the movie.
1118109791|5.0|Studying for the GMAT has never been easier, however I bought this book two months before they came out with a new section.  So do not buy unless you want the relevant material for the other sections.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Enjoyed the movie almost as much as the book just emma watson wasn't really cut out to play a wild and free sam
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Courageous will have you laughing, crying and sitting on the edge of your seat with anticipation.  Everyone will enjoy this but if your a husband/father the movie will make you take a hard look at your leadership role in  the family. Wife / mother it will also impact your life. The story is faith based, but not in a &#34;bible thumping &#34; way. I rented the movie first and as soon as it ended I logged onto Amazon and bought it. Please share this movie with your immediate and extended family, your friends and neighbors.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|I farted and my buthole started hurting its a sharting explosion but none of these buthole know it I sharted I started but yaeh about the IT good I love it I actually farted during it
140006922X|5.0|I gave 5 stars for Mr. Aslan and for his book &#34;Zealot&#34; because he is a decent person, a sophisticated scholar who deserves our respect.  He is not a radical Muslim fundamentalist and surely not a terrorist. He will not explode a bombe and kill people like a Chechen kamikaze (remember?) and he probably will not pilote a plane to destroy the Empire State Building. For all these reasons, he deserves all the stars we could grant him and I would give him much more.<br /><br />That said, I will not buy this book although I highly recommend to all readers and believers willing to do it.<br />I have a problem with analphabet people like Jesus. That he was a radical, a Jew defending his religion or politics<br />against the Rome Empire, that's fine to me. However, the history of Jesus is inundated with lies and hearsays.<br />Reading a texts by a  disciple dated from many years ago trying to guess about the &#34;ideas&#34; of an alphabet, I am sorry this is too much water for my swimming pool.<br /><br />I can't be a religious person. My mind demands proofs, proofs, proofs and Religion delivers only lies, lies and lies.
0440245915|2.0|\\"...I'll be honest with you guys. Courtroom drama and legal thrillers are not really my thing. Sure, I am studying criminal justice as a minor, but my concentration is in forensics: I'm more interested in the investigation and laboratory analysis side of things, not so much the hanging-around-in-a-courthouse-and-meeting-with-lawyers side of things. So if this book had not been assigned for the criminal justice class I've been taking this summer, I would probably not have ever bothered to pick this up. It was my first time reading Grisham, and may well be the last. I know he is a best-selling author, but this just was not for me. I haven't seen the movie adaptation, so maybe adding a live-action element makes the story more compelling, but as far as the book goes, I was actually pretty bored through about 99% of it...<br /><br />...Anyway, so I couldn't find anything about the characters that I liked. When it comes to the story, I wasn't very invested in that, either. The bulk of it is just Jake and everyone else boozing it up and somehow managing to prepare some kind of a defense for the trial...<br /><br />...The only part of the book I found remotely enthralling is at the very end, during the jury deliberations. I don't want to say too much, because if you're like me and you'd never read this book (or never seen the movie either, I guess), I don't want to give too much away, but I doubt if I'll be going out of my way to watch the film and I probably won't be reading much more Grisham, if any...\\"<br /><br />(For the full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger)
0321934946|4.0|I read reviews about the book being easy to read, it really is. There is basically no tech talk so I was happy about that. I am able to look at a topic and know exactly what Scott is talking about. Yes, he does some joking, but he is also informative.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Love this app! When you can't use YouTube on the kindle fire internet app silk this is a great way. Easy to use and very efficient! I will definitely recommend this app to others!
038572179X|5.0|McEwans is a beautiful writer. I enjoyed every page. It is extraordinarily moving and an instant classic. I cry every time.
B002DOSBMK|3.0|While not the second book, it gives a good view into what really started it all for the lovely Drow who stole our hearts and minds and defined fantasy for a time
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This book takes you through a journey with a special individual. It helps you look at the world from the perspective of a high functioning boy with autism. I enjoyed it greatly!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so coll  I like it because it has lava water and animals more New stuff.  The only thing they don't have is nether which I don,t like
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Knowing I'll have a teenage daughter one day soon, I wish she'd find a love, a bond, like Emily and Chris. Yet, it scares the hell out of me that she might.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does everything I need a calculator to do. What more could I ask. I recommend it to anyone who needs a simple calculator.
B00CFA222M|5.0|This movie is quite a bit different than the original story and VERY well done! I guess semantics are alive and well!? The interpretation of the story makes as much sense as any other. The special effects were marvelous and I DO like that!!
B00CS9987W|5.0|This bluray is RIFFELTY-ROFFELTY-MYSTICAL-QUALITY NOW, NOW, NOW!....I've watched this movie my whole life and watching it on bluray is like watching it all over again for the first time. The quality is superb. You notice things you never knew were there. Even the night time scenes show everything in crystal-clear detail. I just hate that its as \\"pricey\\" as it is, but if you are like me, and this is one of your all-time favorite Hitchcock films, you won't mind paying it. Universal, obviously, takes great care of their master copies. Psycho is equally as superb. The Universal Monsters boxed set is incredible also. Those movies were filed in the early '30s but the new bluray transfer makes them look like they were just shot yesterday! I wish I could say this about all the blurays I've seen. My hats off to Universal and thank you for releasing these movies in HD. We will enjoy these for years to come!
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the series and wish they had continued with it. SO many plots... SO little time! I'd recommend this series to anyone that loves the King Arthur/Merlin stories.<br />The strange thing about this series is the rooles they attribute to various characters... Guinevere as a &#34;serving girl&#34;?!??!!???!?!?!?<br />So what... she's cute!
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|This is a great film to watch with the family!  I watched it with our 7-11 year old boys and they thought it was wonderful.  We tend to be conservative with movies--this one does contain fight scenes where people &#34;die,&#34; but no blood and more of &#34;dramatic&#34; fight scenes.  I would call it good, old-fashioned fun!
B0009VRHLK|3.0|This film is pretty much as BORING as they come (hehe)! There is essentially NO plot (so it can't thicken). The &#34;acting&#34; is pretty much nondescript. The camera work could have been done by my nephew Egbert (if I actually HAD a nephew named Egbert!).<br />It's not a movie I would share with others just for the sake of my own safety. Maybe something in a Disney movie?????????????
140006922X|3.0|Let me begin with some disclosures:  I am a PhD holding scholar in the field of social anthropology; I am not a scholar of religion; I am the follower of no religion whatsoever; I do not identify myself as an atheist.  I read this book, and formed opinions about it, before the whole Fox News kerfuffle, which is obviously greatly increasing its popularity.<br /><br />It is hard to disagree with one of the core theses of Aslan's book: Jesus was perceived by the Romans to be a threat to the political order, and this led to his crucifixion.  But arguing this thesis, which, as Aslan rightly admits, is not novel, is not the fundamental aim of this book, in my opinion.  Instead, his aim is to historically prove that Jesus could not have been much different from all the other prophets and rebels of the time who defied the Roman occupation.  He makes this argument by almost completely discounting the gospels, which even secular scholars recognize are the only possible sources for recovering biographical details of the historical Jesus.  He therefore largely ignores the content of Jesus' ministry prior to his arrival in Jerusalem.  Having done this, Aslan has pretty much guaranteed his conclusions from the outset.  If the only thing we can really know about Jesus was that Rome perceived him to be revolutionary, then then the only facts we can recover about him must derive from out knowledge of other revolutionaries of the time.<br /><br />Using similar procedures, Aslan affirms that Jesus was an illiterate peasant and a day-laborer.  (These are Aslan's words.)  But again, his proof of these facts consists largely in the fact that most people from Nazareth were likely illiterate peasant day-laborers.  So once again, if we deny the possibility that Jesus was exceptional in any way, then our portrait of him must be, a fortiori, the portrait of the average Nazarene of his day.  But we all know that exceptional characters exist.  Indeed, it may be highly unlikely that Jesus was literate, but there is not the slightest shred of proof that Jesus was illiterate.  It is not at all hard to imagine how Jesus could have become literate, working as he likely did in the nearby highly-cultured city of Sepphoris, where he could have encountered a patron, for instance.<br /><br />After Aslan asserts for the 10th time that Jesus was an \\"illiterate, peasant, day-laborer,\\"  I lost whatever remaining respect I had for the author of this book.  To make matters worse, the author is misrepresenting both the book and himself in an effort to attract publicity and in order to refute the admittedly stupid and bigoted argument that his book can be discounted because the author is a Muslim.  First, this is NOT a scholarly book, as Aslan claims.  It was not published by an academic press, and given its tone and repeated assertions of unverifiable facts, no respectable academic press would touch it.  (The fact that it is not a scholarly book does not, in and of itself, mean that it couldn't have been cogently argued.)  Furthermore, Aslan does NOT hold a PhD in religion (as he seems to imply), nor is he academically employed as a scholar of religion.  Indeed, he has a highly respectable PhD in sociology from the University of California, Santa Barbara.  But his dissertation research was on contemporary Islamic jihadism.  This clearly makes him an expert on contemporary Islam, but in and of itself, it does NOT mean that he has the scholarly credentials to publish on ancient Christianity in an academic context.<br /><br />But, let me be clear, the reason this is a bad book is not because Aslan lacks the credentials.  There can be excellent and reputable popular books written by scholars who are only marginally related to the field they are writing about.  (Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct comes to mind.  Pinker does not have a PhD in linguistics (he is an experimental psychologist), but his book is a generally fair introduction to mainstream Chomskian linguistic theory. As a scholar, I disagree with Chomskian theory and with many of the conclusions Pinker draws from its application, but that is another matter.)  Also, there can be terrible scholarly books written by authors with impeccable credentials.  (Andrea Muehlebach's The Moral Neoliberal is an outstanding example of a recent awful book by a scholar with impeccable credentials practicing in my own field.)<br /><br />Aslan's credentials are in many respects beside the point. But his misrepresentation of them makes me trust him even less and undermines his own arguments about why his work is valuable. This is simply a poorly argued book.  Aslan does have the humility, however, to cite in his extensive endnotes the scholarly literature that he draws on and much of which he argues against.  If you're interested in the historical Jesus, then go directly to John P. Meier's A Marginal Jew, which is widely regarded, even by Aslan himself, as the modern scholarly masterpiece on the subject
034580709X|4.0|I read all his books and read this one last. I still liked it but I liked the later ones better.
1781162646|4.0|I frankly became dissappointed when I read up the very final pages and ecountered only ONE murder attempt! That was very rare situation for The Author. Nontheless, I can say the he managed to keep me reading up to the final pages, that must be the real success of this novel.....

B0013ND30M|1.0|I ordered the 2 disc platinum addition; what I received was a single disc in a floppy case that came with an addition plastic case that was completely broken and cracked, and on top of all that the disc would not even play. There were no visible scratches but when I put it in the player the screen would just go black and skip.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is  awesome I played it on my friends kindle and I new I needed to get it thanks Amazon for an awesome game
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a back up in case I need it. What a mess I made for myself when I left mine at a hotel. They have a drawer full of forgotten cords, so I really couldn't get it back. The wall charger is the best, but this is on stand-by.
B009X011UQ|5.0|The case easily fits a quick collapse universal tripod. Case is thin and light. Also protects the screen. Color was perfect for my daughter.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Always have my favorite books with me on my tablet or android phone.  Can bring several books with me at all times.
140006922X|4.0|You can understand no history if you don't understand Roman history. Zealot is a beautiful example of this. It takes the reader back to the time of the Romans to explain the man known as Jesus. It is one of the first explorations of the faith I can respect.
B007N31Z06|5.0|Brings back memories.  Loved this movie the first time and each and every time I watch it.  Now I can watch whenever I want.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Timeless great movie for all ages. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone of any age. You can watch it with your family.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the Bible App from YouVersion.  I find it much easier to stay in the word and to do bible and topical studies.  I have learned so much from this app by taking a few minutes each day to read, meditate, and put into action what I have read.  I have told many of my friends about YouVersion and encourage them to start using this product whether it be online, phone, or Kindle Fire in my use.  Highly recommend!

0060936223|5.0|\\"Just Kids\\" is Patti Smith's tender, straightforward memoir of a remarkable relationship, two artist's temperaments, and the artistic process as told through the relatively innocent and idealistic eyes of youth.<br /><br />The late 1960's and the early 1970's must have been a very exciting time to live in New York. Rents were affordable and artists' spaces could be found on the cheap. In \\"Just Kids,\\" Patti Smith moves there as a young woman looking for herself and what she wants to be. She ends up moving in with a young man she meets by chance, Robert Mapplethorpe, who is looking for the same thing. Together they grow up. Robert finds art and photography, and Patti finds poetry and music.<br /><br />Along the way they meet the real people and places of the time that have not yet slipped into the mists of legend. They live for a time in the Chelsea Hotel. They meet Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Alan Ginsberg, hangers on from Andy Warhol's Factory, and many others. We are witness to the early scene at CBGB. Smith doesn't dwell on details so much as give the reader a sepia-washed impressionistic painting of the people, the time, the place, and her tender and slowly changing relationship with Robert.<br /><br />Smith writes without pretension. We get the feeling that she and Robert find what they were meant to do and would be happy doing it whether they became successful or not. Success may or may not follow later, but it will only come after the artist finds the true person he or she is. This is what we get in \\"Just Kids.\\" We get the people. They don't know what they will become. No one does. They only know that they are being true to themselves, and that seems to be the right path to walk at the time.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|My review has less to do with the book, of which there are many interesting reviews already, but more to do with the fact that the author refers to multiple illustrations and charts in the book but there are no corresponding illustrations in the Kindle version.  I have several kindle graphic novels so I know that they can handle graphics.  They need to work on a better solution to this issue.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|At first I really was excited to play this until I found out how long it takes to get a house or a pet I mean you have to wait for at least 4 or 3 days and also I updated the game  and end up with only getting 5 freaking hearts usually you can get up to like 20 or 30 and you have to spend real money on the diamonds so basically this game kinda sucks .
B00AEBBADG|5.0|I really liked this movie but was a little disappointed that it wasn't the original version of the film. It is still a great movie especially for the price that they have it at.
B00004ZELJ|4.0|I love the Backstreet Boys so much & I've been waiting to buy this dvd. The dvd was in great condition & it was sealed tightly. There was no damage outside & outside of the dvd.

0812974611|5.0|I picked this book up in the airport in Manchester UK, en route to Boston.  I thought it would be interesting.  Instead the book is compelling, compulsively readable.  I read the book the entire plane ride and mourned the end as I arrived in Boston.<br /><br />This book takes Roman water administration and makes it a fascinating lens through which to view life, love, corruption, and everyday occurrences in the Roman Empire. This is a novel where you know the end before you start, yet you are mesmerized by the plot and eagerly race through the pages to discover what comes next. I reference \\"I, Claudius\\" in my title.  This book hit me with the same vigor and life that \\"I, Claudius\\" did.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to my friends and have not had one complaint.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It is very cute and has some humor that will make adults nostalgic over games from their childhoods. We watched it over and over.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The book is okay.  Different concept than I've read before but wasn't real riveting.  I would read sequels but not buy them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its a wonderful game and its really challenges me alot. Some of the levels are difficult but I get through them.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Lots of do's and don'ts and just basic solidly presented infomration.  Recommedn anyone considering this option to review this book.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|It was a long ending. Took me much longer time to finish reading this book than the other 2 books.
B005UKJX4E|2.0|The movie did not hold my interest. Very slow and difficult to follow the story line. I was ready to turn it off after 15 minutes.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Love the magnetic plug and it works as advertised.  Good quality hardware.  Much better then the supplied cord used to charge my Nexus

B00005N6KG|4.0|They never disappoint. I've bought these for years. Great for the gym. They're lightweight and comfortable. Great sound for the price!
B002EAKWEI|5.0|Very pleased with quality of the set. Includes all episodes and am enjoying every one of them. Jeremy Brett was the best Holmes ever.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|First off, Taken is my favorite movie, hence the poster I have in my media room. Liam Neeson is a fantastic actor in this film and his fighting skills will leave you in awe. In my opinion, the action is the best part of the movie, however the plot is solid and interesting at the same time. Everybody in this movie did a wonderful job and if you are debating about watching it... just do it!!
0606235434|4.0|I purchased this as a suprise gift or a close friend that is a deep Martial Art and Brue Lee Fain.

0399255370|5.0|My 6-yr-old grandson has become very excited about and adept at reading.  1st grade starts in 2 weeks and he thought this book was terrific -- excellent for that age and grade.
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|I think the game overall is fun. The concept is good as are the controls<br /><br />The part that is frustrating is the \\"ready, go\\" pause every 10 seconds. It totally kills the pace of the game and any thought process you have going.<br /><br />Please remove the pauses or put an option for it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent program. Can't wait for Season 4 to get here. This program is never boring and the casting is superb! The writer has a ball making life miserable for this family and we love watching it unfold. The Dowager Countess of Grantham (Maggie Smith) is wickedly funny and Robert is such a grand buffoon, blustering all over the place only to be put in his place by his wife Cora. The kitchen staff and Carson and Mrs. Hughes are such an eclectic group that make this drama even more entertaining. Wouldn't miss an episode for anything short of a funeral. Hope it runs for a loooooong time......
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I do like it although I'm not sure how often I might use it.  The download was simple and I was able to add my itunes music to the music that I purchased from Amazon.  I do like the concept.
B00E0OK2X2|5.0|This game has awesome techno music. The game is two finger game where you have to destroy objects with that line inside the circle. Your two fingers at the opposite sides of the circle will meet up to create a line. The game changes colors and music as the game progresses. It's a lot of fun for techno lovers.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Starts out very exciting and along the way has some twists and turns. But the ending is very abrupt and not thourogh. Not her best.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|DARK AND FIERCE!<br />Christopher Nolan introduces Batman in a way that no other director could have. I've been waiting and I waited enough and here's my idol from when I was child, coming to life how he was meant to.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!<br />This great film left me breathless. When I finished watching it I couldn't close my mouth. Heath Ledger's performance is, well, there's no words to describe, his performance is out of this world. He had me cheering for him, and it's rare that I side with the villain characters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game and very playable, everything works well. no difficulty picking up or choosing items from inventory. not so difficult that the solution is super vague. hopefully later levels will be more challenging but not impossible.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|I am very satisfied with my purchase! Having two kids I needed something to hold wipes and was easy to access. The red button does come open sometimes but it really hasn't affected my feelings for this product or my purchase.

0060736267|5.0|I'm not even done reading this book yet, but I have fallen in love with the characters and the story.  I am from Brooklyn, my mom is from the Bronx, and my mom says this story very closely describes her experiences growing up in the Bronx.  I'm proud to see how far Brooklyn has come as a community, based on what was clearly an impoverished time in its history.  It's funny, it's sad, it's clever, it's thought-provoking.  I love it, and I'm just eating it up.  I'm ashamed that it took me this long to finally read this classic...
B0085PFG1U|5.0|This is by far the best calculator I've found for android. Graphing is awesome, the fact that it lays out your problems. Wish it did a little more work showing, but hey have to do some of the work :p
B005DF2QMC|5.0|I have so much of my old music on cassette tape that I didn't want to have to pay a lot of money to have converted to a digital format.  This product made it SO affordable and EASY to transfer all my music into an digital format that I can save forever and not worry about cassette tape deterioration.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|If you are like me and want to build a simple PC for mostly office tasks, yet give it enough punch in the graphics and speed departments to enjoy using it for media applications, then this is definitely a Processor you'll want to consider.  There are a lot faster chips out there, even from AMD, but this basic quad-core is all you will need for a great office PC.  I highly recommend it.
0345529057|2.0|I got through the first 200 pages of the first book and had to put it down to switch to reading another book because I was bored out of my skull.  I don't get why this story is so popular.  Meanwhile, I bought this whole set and am determined to get through it.  But I just couldn't force myself to read it much further.  I figured I'd take a break and try again.  I just don't get it.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This series is amazing.  I've watched it many times.  It is one of the best series I have ever seen, and definitely the best WWII series.
B000002JEV|5.0|There is nothing Led Zeppelin does that I wouldn't love.  So, not sure how good of a review that is..  But this band can do no wrong.  The BBC Sessions are no exception.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Great!  I loved it!  I like they they weaved some actual history into this series, though mostly it was just entertainment.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin, to me, is one of the greatest bands in the world, and this record shows their continued top notch talent.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I don't really know why they package it like this, but whatever....I gave the DVD to my mother and kept the BRD for myself.  The BRD has GREAT quality for such an old movie.  They really did a nice job, especially on the opening sequence.<br /><br />There is a nice sing-a-long function if you have kids.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I haven't read the rest of the series yet, but this book is off to a good start. It's very character driven as the majority of it is told by one of the main characters. It is a little slow moving at first, but don't let that distract you. I love how Rothfuss has layers of stories in his story, I think it strongly contributes to a uniqueness in his writing style. Definitely recommended for fantasy fans.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Just had our discussion on this book today.  Everyone really enjoyed the book.  This author did a great job of<br />keeping your interest so you were anxious to get back to it when you had to put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|after update wont load sits in loading at 0% for minutes. was a fun game. disappointed :(<br />would re download if they fix the problems.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|great series cant believe I never seen it before couldn't stop watching I cant wait for the next season to be put on
B0071BY1CO|5.0|The movie is very funny. 3d is decent and my kids love it. I'm pretty sure if you like the first one you will love the sequel.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game... my daughter loves it. wish energy didn't run out so quickly though. Overall is a great game especially for young girls.
0817439390|5.0|How can I put it. This book is a good introduction to elementary photography. It was fun and educational reading. You can read and understand topics including dealing with over and underexposure, light and its variables, composition, metering modes, white balance, depth of field and others little tricks that will help you  become a better photographer.
B006T5GTK0|5.0|Very compelling film, true to life. Excellent acting.  It makes us all realize how much our men Andy women in service endured.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|It is movie about life of Gandhi. Excellent movie. The quality of the video was outstanding and streaming had no problems.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Really cool and stuff but it is really lacking updates and could use better control's but other than that it is a pretty good app
B004MC8CA2|2.0|every time I want to read a verse from the Bible for my C.O.O.L HW it always says that I have to fore close it and for the record it needs wifi so that means I can't use it at church or anywhere else for that matter. I honestly wouldn't recommend it for a person that always relies on the Bible in their daily lives, like me. but otherwise I would say that everything else about it is fine.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is always upbeat. New places with new themes. There is always a challenge happening, in the high paced,surf boarding, adventure.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Firstly,  I have played  hundreds of games similar to this, so I have a good idea on what is cool and what sucks.  This game is great because I am not able to finish it in one day, like most other hidden object games.  It has a lot of content and it isn't the same thing over and over.  If has many different ways of finding objects and completing tasks and has a good story line.  The only complaint, which is why I gave it a 4, was because of the find the differences mini-game. The mini-game is quite tiny and I was not able to figure out how to zoom in, but otherwise, it is a great game. It was free when I got it, but I am confident that I would absolutely purchase this game having known that it would take some time to complete it. I feel that it is one of the biggest downfalls of most hidden object games, too short and not much to it.  If you're looking for a great game that you can't put down, this is it.  Rock on guys, well done. And no, I have not completed it yet, lol.
1451624468|5.0|If we accept that Science separates physical from metaphysical knowledge (and thus restricts us to things that are discoverable by examining what exists in the physical world), and then define \\"nothing\\" as a world with \\"no stuff.\\" And further accept that science can change the kinds of questions we can ask ourselves as well as what is accepted as \\"common sense,\\" then we are prepared to embrace professor Krauss' beautiful treatise on why there is something instead of nothing.<br /><br />Appropriately enough, he begins this incredible adventure at the end (i.e., where we are today) and works backwards through scientific history to the Big Bang. The recent partial confirmation of the existence of the \\"Higgs Boson Field\\" and its associated particle, \\"the Higgs particle,\\" brings testing of the Big Bang, General Relativity, and Quantum Theories to a dramatic triangulated cosmic climax.<br /><br />One of the great paradigms of science that has sustained (and is sustained by) this confirmation is that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs as an accidental byproduct of the cooling of the universe from the Big Bang. The forces we see (and maybe even the laws that govern them), emerge dynamically from the processes of this paradigm.<br /><br />The way the process works is analogous to the way temperature triggers the change in water into its different component forms: If hot enough, water changes into a gas (water vapor); if cold enough, into a solid (ice). Likewise, as the universe cools from the Big Bang, background fields that cause similar spontaneous symmetry breaking come into play. The fundamental difference however is that the background fields and particles predicted and then discovered in the laboratory, convey theoretically predictable changes in the energy and mass of various (often yet to be seen) particles.<br /><br />The \\"Higgs Boson field\\" and its associated \\"Higgs particle\\" is a dramatic case in point. Their existences was predicted based only on a theoreticalmodel of the symmetry breaking paradigm. That paradigm was tested and confirmed using the LHC in Geneva Switzerland.<br /><br />However, as this book testifies to, theoretically creating the conditions that exhibit these previously unknown entities is only the beginning of what demonstrating their existence means. Among many other things (like reconfirming General Relativity and Quantum theory), exhibiting their existence also means that particles can indeed be created out of nothing! Moreover, it is further confirmation that the theory of the Big Bang is increasingly on more solid ground. Additionally, it also means that positing an imaginary friend in the sky, a god, a cosmic Saddam Hussein, is superfluous. It means further that science is indeed a faith, but a shakable faith, one that is not dogmatic, but can correct its own mistakes.<br /><br />This is science writing about difficult topics at its confident best. Five stars
B009UZBLSG|1.0|I bought 1, and I thought it was a dud so I bought a second one. Tried new HDMI cables, tried different TV's and monitors. Tried on my Nexus 4 and my 2013 Nexus 7. I really would like my money back or an exchange. I give up and will not recommend this brand of SlimPort to anyone. Very disappointed.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Plays well on Transformer Prime. Entertaining enough for myself and my 8 year old. Keeps the mind engaged, but not so difficult that it frustrates.
B00CHIY5OK|5.0|This album barely peaked onto the US charts but I'm glad I found it on my local public radio station. Took four songs to make me listen to it over and over and now I'm in love with all of it. The sounds range from that 90s house bass to the 80s high hat sounds but the richness of the lyrics and songs are unique. Bought the CD so I could get the full audio range since MP3s compact the sound range.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|The first season played without a hitch. The second season - not so much. Switched to Netflix and there have been a few pauses but not the constant starts and stops we had with Amazon.<br /><br />I have CenturyLink DSL at 7 Mbps. I checked my download speed during the Amazon pauses and it was normal.
B007NVIB5U|5.0|show is great.  please add the complete run of the season, Amazon!!!  Let's please have more programming like this included with Prime.  Thanks!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|after moving to the country from the city I found it to quiet to fall asleep.  love having noise to put me to sleep.great app! !!!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|People say it won't update make sure your device lets games update automatically and kindle fire shouldn't update to 0.7.2 because it had glitches so don't think it will so just read my advice and it should work go to setting find app manager or settings and then you have to find updates and make it so that you don't have to update them yourself by setting it to update automatically. Thx for reading and hope it helped if it helped press yes
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I am an elementary teacher and I think my students would love this book. Thanks
B003Y6EL5W|3.0|It's a decent movie, not worth buying it.  Purchasing off our roku was easy and good quality would recommend this.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|What a fantastic man Gandhi was ! I'd read the book many years ago and I'd seen the movie. Ben Kingsley IS Gandhi Ji and the story follows the great man from his years as a young lawyer in a time of horrific discrimination and cruelty in S. Africa to his life of peaceful non-violent  activism in India . It's all there in the history books ,if you're lucky. But if you're unfortunate enough to be one of those who has no idea who Gandhi was................time to get this DVD or the book !
098478280X|5.0|Great book to prep you for developer interviews. Good set of questionnaire and tips to deal with non-technical interviews. Highly Recommended.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|I ordered this dvd to replace one I'd lost because I was so fond of the movie. The story of Malcolm X is so dynamic and strong. It is also very sad. The performances of the actors, especially Denzel Washington, are well worth watching and deserving of the attention they received when the movie was shown in theaters. I recommend this  to anyone who enjoys first rate acting and a powerful stroy....all well done.
1421550644|5.0|Nicely Bound. Box is a nice bonus, along with small posters. Large format reveals details. Good, strong print. A must for any serious Nausicaa or Miyazaki fan as much of the movie edited out much of the original story. Very, Very please to have found this treasure.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|How could a movie with Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino playing opposite one another in good guy vs bad guy not be great entertainment.  Well done crime drama with a great supporting cast - that at times makes you hope the bad guys come out ahead.
B006BQI1V2|5.0|Very well done and thought provoking story.  I never understood the whole story until now. I have started researching that part of history and am amazed at what I am learning.
B003477DVK|5.0|We love this heartfelt movie. It's great for the entire family and depicts the love between a child and their dog.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I'm a puzzle lover and I LOVE this app. Now I can do puzzles wherever I go!!! If you like puzzles then you have to try a Magic Jigsaw Puzzles!!!
B00D23K0MU|5.0|She is definitely one of a kind. I cant get enough of this singer. She has a true voice, no over rated sound manipulation going on here.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It was a eye opener for me as to learn how battles in Iraq was not short  and over quick but lasted long.  Enjoyed learning the story of an American hero.
B0061S0A64|2.0|I guess I am NOT very musical because I could not make sense out of this node game. It was kind of frustrating that I could never repeat the same thing twice.everytime I use it it is a brand new cluster f***sorry but I uninstalled it
B00DDZM0GQ|1.0|I was really excited to see what this app was, but when I started downloading it wouldn't complete the process. I guess I'll have to wait until all the bugs are worked out. (At least it was the free app of the day!) :D
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A beautifully done story about how far reaching our decisions are and how many lives they affect. It easily captures both the joys and sorrows that are present for every person. I would recommend this for any mature adult to read.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|If the reader has to have a smooth and orderly plot, look elsewhere.  The plot is very intricate and well laid out.  Bear with the story as much of the book sets up a great climax.  A fun read!<br />.
B004FS1TLM|4.0|I am sure she will LOVE it...bought it as a gift because I bought the wrong one previously...good one this time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing! The graphics are super. I highly recommend this app for horse lovers like myself! Overall lovely app.<br />Hannah
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Some of the rooms are frustrating but for the most part, they are a pleasant mix of challenge and easier parts to give you a sense of victory..
B00AB7HESI|5.0|You should DEFINATELY get this app especially if you are creative like me! It is a unique game, and you should buy it! :)
B004JZBGWI|5.0|as a list maker I love the utility of this app. I gave it 5 stars because I use it EVERY day. If I could change one thing, I would make it so I can add an item in a middle of a list rather than having to create it at the top or bottom then move it.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is far the best game ever and the scratch off cards are the best.. best 2013 game ever. I enjoy it on my kindle fire and my kids enjoy it too.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have had a Kindle for years, that I love.  With this app I can read color content on my Android, share my library, and keep my place when switching between equipment.  It's great that I don't have to travel with both items any more.  Thanks Amazon.
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|I had an amazing experience with my seller of these splendid books. The Pumpkin Patch is the name of the seller I went through and is the only seller you guys should go through. They actually took the picture that is posted. They are not small-sized hardcovers as you will get with some of these other sellers. The exact dust jackets posted as well. Perfect dimensions, great books, outstanding packaging. Arrived two days before expected! Everyone needs to go through The Pumpkin Patch seller for the people looking at hardcovers, as they are fast, willing to answer any questions you have and are honest in what they say they are selling. (Review only for Hardcovers). 6 out of 5!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|[[ASIN:B00B2V66VS Temple Run 2]]<br /><br />Subway surfers is a very addicting game and involves a lot of skill, and I reccomend this particular game to any and every child who likes games.
0446699616|3.0|I like some of DeMille's work but other books are spotty. This one is too long by at least half. John Corey's wisecracking nudged the book up to three stars but it's really more like 2.5 stars for me.<br /><br />Corey and others are chasing a terrorist in Yemen. There's a lot of standing around ruminating and standing around being in danger. This felt like an attempt to up the tension but tension needs and outlet and the outlet was too long in coming.
B00BU18U82|5.0|My 11 year old is addicted to everything truck/heavy machinery.  There aren't alot of games that hold his interest as he really isn't that good at them in compared to his brothers (a trait we share).  This game is easy to use and he absolutely loves that he is able to drive all different types of machinery.  He was so happy with this that we purchased the full version for the laptop as well as the tablet app.  He was excited when he got the full version and found there were tons more vehicles that he could drive.  Finally, we have found a way to get our ADHD, OCD son to be quiet.....Farming Simulator
B005VMSATA|1.0|Purchased the HD rental instead of SD for high quality.  But quality was terrible, like it was a 1980's video instead of a recent blockbuster movie with special effects.  What gives with that?  Wasted money to get high quality when it really was bad.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|What a powerful voice she has.  Was worth getting on my kindle as well as the cd.  If only I could get my music from my laptop onto my kindle
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|I enjoyed this author's writing style very much. A lot of interiority. The main character was difficult to like sometimes but by the end, I was 100% on her side.  Really makes you think about how we treat animals in our society.  I'd recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The latest update has corrected a problem with screen freezes on Kindle Fire. Still no access to TWC web site for easy access to frontal charts(current weather map)  or some of the maps that help to show how weather is developing.<br />  And no severe weather forecast maps. I have not had a severe weather alert so I can not comment on those notifications.<br />  Nice thing is it is still free to user.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Shopped online for several days before deciding on this case. When I received the case I knew I had made the correct decision. Camera and all accessories fit easily. Like the fact that it can be carried with a handle or slung over the shoulder like  backpack. Very durable material with good insulation for your delicate camera stuff.  Only wish I had had longer use of it, for someone ripped it off with all my camera stuff inside!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Kids book really, but it's light and worth a read - great to just switch off and flick through it!
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|I love the game it's truly fun!! But your app has issues!! I can't connect to Facebook to get more friends or the gift you get for connecting to Facebook!! This needs to be dealt with or there is really no point playing!! You need FRIENDS to play these sort of games!!! PLEASE FIX THIS OR I WILL BE UNINSTALLING THIS GAME/ APP!!!!
B004R63MWQ|2.0|A childs' movie.  Watched maybe 10 minutes.  Overblown and full of empty gravitas.  I was reminded that I was a kid when i saw the original.<br />&#34;it is a tale<br />Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br />Signifying nothing.&#34;
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome series!! Love it! So good and keeps you wanting to watch more of it! Such a great show, worth the watch!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|David Fincher is my favorite director. This movie's a classic. Obviously if you can't handle a little (a lot) blood and violence - then this film might not be for you. But you should still watch it - it's Fight Club. (And Brad Pitt ladies, I mean come on)
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Very very well done film about your food supply line.  If you're at all interested in data about the foods you eat, this film is for you. Lots of info that you probably didn't know about food supply line.  Well done film and very good quality production.  May change the foods you buy and consume from now on.  Loved it.
B008US4PBY|1.0|I have never written a bad review in my life...but here goes.  This was the most disappointing device ever! My son saved his hard earned money at 12yrs old to buy this device and it never worked correctly--not one time.  The disappointment on his face was so sad... I just wish people would be truthful when they manufacture/ create a device... if it doesn't work- try again. Don't just throw something together to make a buck... make it a HIGH QUALITY item!  UGH
B007SGLZP8|3.0|He most always makes for a good read. This certainly is not spectacular with its over details but nonetheless a good book.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|I realize that a movie based on a book should ideally be viewed on its own merits, but the screenplay managed to surgically remove my favorite parts of the book and drastically alter characters and events to an extent that I couldn't enjoy it on its own. The arc of Pat's self discovery of his aversion to Kenny G (which I can understand as a musician; but for some reason replaced by a Stevie Wonder song in the movie) was ham-handedly shoehorned in way too soon. Pat and Tiffany's first date at the diner was hilarious in the book, with Pat demonstrating his need to tip generously.  I felt that the producers didn't feel like paying Robert Deniro to speak as little as Pat's father did in the book. I also felt that the dance scene, completely changed from the book, was a crass attempt to exploit the popularity of \\"Dancing With the Stars.\\" I was so looking forward to seeing this move, but was extremely disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am enjoying this game. The different levels are great. looking forward to more games like this one it is relaxing. keep up your good work.  thank you
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The potential for this once pandora and chrome (from Android) casting is available is why I bought it.  I don't use netflix and I use youtube sometimes so reall this is fairly limited at the moment.<br /><br />The ability for it to turn on your TV and swap inputs for you is awesome.  Note that turning the TV on is only possible if the USB power is on while the TV is not (usually will mean external power source) and I believe it requires the latest HDMI standard.  The input switching should work for most everyone.<br /><br />I love that it streams from the net itself so your phone isn't rendering or DLing anything.  Saves my battery while I still get to use it as a remote and browse whatever else I want to while the thing I &#34;cast&#34; is on the TV.<br /><br />Awesome device, awesome price, awesome potential.  Needs more apps to reach 5 stars.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It did exactly what I needed it to do, the price was right and it was super easy to use
B006CUDDUG|5.0|Read this book. Re-read it, or read it for the first time. Read it twice. It's the novel that made LeCarre's name, and remains one of his finest. It's scary, thrilling, gruesome, tragic, and ultimately a story of redemption. I think.
0763660531|5.0|Rarely has a book managed to distill so finely that primal sense of enchantment that characterizes the best of childhood, and which most of us eventually lose touch with, somehow. That Becker is able to recapture this enchantment using only images -- no words -- is testimony to his great power as an illustrator and storyteller. Journey is ravishing -- pure visual poetry -- and, in closing, leaves a faint, musical ache for the world it invokes. At the same time, it serves as an encouraging reminder that this world is within the reach of anyone willing to close their eyes and let their imagination wander. I salute the author. As the Times reported, this is a true 'masterwork,' and a stunning debut for an incredible talent.
B002M87V0A|5.0|I was raised on this movie, and I think it should be mandatory viewing. Also, you'll appreciate The Simpsons 'Monorail' song so much more.. and that alone is worth it. A genuine, bonafide, electrified, six car monorail!<br /><br />Also it's weird how not attractive Robert Preston is, but still.... he wins my heart every time.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and it was suprisingly really scary. I loved it. Everything I could want from a horror movie. Buy it!
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|Having seen the last one in the theater, I still think all these are classics. Still wonder why the last had to be PG-13.
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|I really liked this book. One of those you just have to keep reading. Looking forward to reading more from this author.
145210655X|5.0|I got both Little Princess and Son for my brother.  He read both right away.  Great books for the Star Wars parent. The spin on movie lines is great.  Mr. Brown must be a great fan of the series and it shows.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|If you like old Simon & Garfunkel then you should like this.  Quite haunting and addictive.  See the video Searching for Sugarman for more background.
B00CFA225Y|1.0|Maybe I was expecting more,you know,action,monsters,good 3d. I think its for a younger crowd. 3d was decent,nothing special,so I cant recommend it,even for 3d only.
B003NB8KE6|5.0|I was a skeptic before but I bought it after reading the reviews here and I needed to experience it for myself first hand, and it really does alleviate soreness. Specially intensified my workouts with interval trainings to the point of cramping. Went home too a shower and slept in these and work up good as new and ready for more runs.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|We haven't completely finished Firefly, yet.  But we've watched most of the episodes.  And, having never seen the show before, I have to say that it has a fresh, different feel to a common theme.  The characters are well-developed, and they get you emotionally invested in many of them.<br /><br />My only regret is not watching this show sooner!
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I enjoyed this show. It was really funny and well written.  This show actually surprised me. I will be watching more episodes.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show and addicting!! We finished watching 3 seasons within 3 weeks! This is one of the best shows out there.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I am afraid it is quite addicting!  Play it for awhile almost every day!  Fun on my Kindle Fire in color!  Get rather passionate about knocking out those piglets!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a game you cant go wrong with.The things you have 2 luv r minions,dogs and this game if u don't GET OUT OF AMERICA
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the Despicable Me movies, so it seemed right for the kids to have this game!  They LOVE it...play it everyday!
1423140605|5.0|What an enjoyable and fast read.  What fun it is to cheer and cry for our group of heroes as they attempt to do the impossible.  I'm excited and in anticipation of The House of Hades this October.  Great fiction/mythology!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Really enjoyed the book...Nikki Sixx has great insights and is awesome with the camera.  Again, the book is a great read!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I absolutely loved this story. Dreamy and fantastic!  Will keep you spellbound the entire time you read it and hope the circus never ends.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|The Piano Guys score again with a fantastic blend of classical, electronic, and movie-themed music.<br /><br />From one cellist to another, this is an amazing piece of work!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I really like this game and I think the way it is set up is cool. You can earn or win the acorns and money you need to purchase animals ,fun games and decorations. You can also use coins or acorns to expand your lands. I love the way you can visit random players and send them friend requests as none of my friends like to play these kinds of games. I haven't had any trouble with crashing or freezing or visiting friends! I play on a Kindle and never have those problems! It does take time to collect enough coins or acorns for some things, especially if you don't want to spend real money on the game ( I don't ).  Now the reason for my *Sigh*, each time you expand your land the cost goes up, that is normal in most games, in this one it goes up 100,000 each time after you reach a 100,000.  This was cool with me because you collect coins pretty fast but at 900,000 instead of going to a million to expand it went to 10,000,000. At that rate I am guessing I will not be expanding much now, so two stars off for that little surprise!!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The creativity expressed in The Piano Guys harmonies is difficult to describe.  While some may find the repeating themes redundant or uncreative, I find the blend to be an incredible synthesis of contemporary dance-style music and classical creativity.  I absolutely LOVE The Piano Guys' music.  If you like electronic and classical music woven together, pick this up!
159463176X|3.0|It was a good story but trying to keep up with the characters was difficult as it jumped around from person to person too much.  After about 75% through the book I started to skip a lot of paragraphs just to get to the end.
B009A87X80|5.0|A couple of months ago Eva came to my attention. I was impressed but apparently busy with something else and she slipped by. I look at a lot of Youtube videos and happened to see one of a bride singing &#34;Songbird&#34; to her new husband. It was quite a production with a couple of back up singers followed by a chorus of same. I looked to see who had recorded it and only Eva was listed as i remember. Youtube lists other songs on the right hand side of the page and I listened to other of her recordings. More research led me to her story. I like to send my daughter stuff she has never known and ordered this for her birthday and one for me. I have probably listened to it six or seven times since last Thursday. Songs I had not known attracted me, especially &#34;I Know You By Heart&#34;. It has touched my heart. A song that has genuine feeling (from the lyricist's personal experience) is excellent. It is not a &#34;someone done someone wrong, song&#34;. It is an emotional, tender loving song about the loss of a loved one. I highly recommend this CD by one who only lived to be 33 years old. (Karen Carpenter was 32. The good really do die young.)
B00BR0SGN0|3.0|As a huge Purple fan I have to say its just ok. Some really good tracks, and some just un inspiring
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|This was a very interesting work by Miss Austen. My family, wife and all girls, have been big fans for a long time. I read two different parodies of &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; so I read the &#34;real&#34; book to see how close the parodies were. Then I read &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34; after seeing the splendid performance of Emma Thompson. So that was #2. Then I read this book,, &#34;Persuasion&#34;. I have the complete set and am reading &#34;Emma&#34; which has a biography of which I have read much. Learning of Miss Austen and her seemingly very limited contact with the real world I continually am amazed at what she was able to do. Her language stuns me at time. After some of her female character's lengthy speeches I expect the man to whom she is speaking to say, &#34;Huh?&#34; I don't rank the books as favorite or in any other way. She was a great talent and so far all I have read I find very good, maybe fascinating. I highly recommend &#34;Persuasion&#34;, as well as the others.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so addicting!!  Some levels make you really think and some you can get through quick.  It's an addicting game.  I finished all the levels in 3 days.  Wish there were a lot more levels.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I pretty much start every day at the office by listening to Hold on. This CD helps keep me sain.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I've been playing this game for quite some time now and still enjoy it.  I do have problems when trying to visit friends (neighbors).  I use to be able to visit like 10 or more and now for some reason I can only visit 4 a night.  This part of the game needs to be improved on.  I've turned it off and then back on again and tried evrything I could think of and still can't visit more than 4 friends a night.  I still like playing the on a daily basis even if it's just to collect my coins real quick or to sit and actually play it for a half hour or  so.
0545586178|5.0|I love this story and this book is the best of the series.  Nothing compares. You feel a personal connection to the characters and the plights they are suffering through.
B000YAA68C|5.0|Definitely the best romance movie ever! It never gets old and always pulls at my heart strings. Grab a box of tissues for this one and some chocolate :P
B00BQH9SY0|4.0|These guys rock. Wish I could have seen them at Coachella. Always like new original music. Could list to sweater weather on repeat all day.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I could watch this over and over....Love the animation and the story line parallel.  Written as if it could really &#34;BE&#34;.
0439023513|3.0|Because the setting for this book is so much different than the first two it is a very hard transition.  Being such a huge fan of the first two this is almost like reading an entirely different book with the same character names. The ending however is great!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game was pretty good, but not as good as the first Magic Academy.  The dialog was a little annoying,  but I just turned off the sound.  The searches were different and required several steps-some intuitive and others more just lucky tapping.  Some of the objects to be used were very difficult to place correctly-especially in the chapter in the book room. Overall the game was fun.
B0083EM24C|2.0|There is one good song on this record and one more that I can stand. The rest are a combination of DJ A.D.D and a tolder with random instruments.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|If anybody wants to know why Joni Mitchell is perhaps one of the finest (and underrated) songwriters of the 20th century, this is a great place to start. Every album in the collection is a masterpiece and each album is truly distinctive. This is such a modestly priced collection and each album comes as a cd replica of the original vinyl casing and artwork. I would recommend this to anybody even slightly interested in Joni. It's easy to see why she is really the musician's musician, she just leaves many of her contemporaries in the dust. Very few careers have had such longevity and few artists have been able to stamp such a unique mark on popular music while experimenting with nearly every genre within western popular music. Her music and this collection are surely worth the price.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Great for kids and to open discussion about the unfairness in the world and how to witness it without hardening to it.  Very well done and minimal hoke.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This book will see you evaluating and wondering about events & people in your life just like Harold.Anything is possible.  I found myself cheering Harold on. I couldn't wait to see who he met next.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really awesome. Need to make panda version or puppy version. My best friend recommended it to me. I LOVE IT!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has to be one of the best books I've ever read. It comes alive with detail and paints a beautiful picture in my head. Only wish the movie had been more detailed.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|I've been a fan of Joe's since his first cd.  He delivers great song time after time.  Loving this cd!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a awesome games it is better then ever I I have 80 Dragons lots of pogosticks I have lots of stuff like people
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|this movie was good basicily  it was excalent!i like really well spoiler alert what happent when harry found out about his scar what did it mean.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This game is lots of fun. I just don't like that you only get to play a couple of games before you run completely out of tokens and either have to buy more (using real money) or wait atleast 20 min to try to win a few more. Would be better if you could play more games without all the waiting
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love this Marware cover!  It is thin and lightweight yet seems sturdy, covers nicely. Would recommend this to anyone!
B0061S0A64|5.0|It took me a bit to get used to the mechanics but once it clicked, I really enjoyed it. I wish there was a way to change the timing but other than fun music app.
B00C5XBAOA|1.0|My daughter like most little girls just loves Sofia, so I bought the Magical Talking Castle and the Royal Family Figurine Set to go with it. First of all the figures mostly DO NOT WORK with the talking feature of the Magical Castle. Only Sofia, and sometimes Amber and Clover, work at all, and everybody else just speaks as Sofia, which is such a disappointment. It is great that there are figures of Miranda and Roland that are not available in the Disney Store figurine set, and that those figures are nice and large, but as I said before, they do not work with the castle, and they are also difficult to keep standing with the way the feet are made to fit on the talking castle piece that doesn't work anyways (not Miranda, as she has a flat bottom). They would have been better off just making this a more poseable figure set without the non-functioning talking feature even being attempted. PLUS...the heads fall off of the little ones immediately and constantly, and that does not require any kind of vigorous play at all. Personally, I would also like to find a set that includes Bailiwick and Cedric, since I think that they are just as important to the show, but they got left behind, at least for now. It very much seems like these toys got rushed out the door to take advantage of the popularity of the show, because it appears that I did not just get a bad item, since everybody is having the same problems it seems, and I have no idea how this got through any kind of quality control testing at Mattel. I confess that this was all far more disappointing to me than my 5-year old, but still a total letdown compared to expectations. My daughter would still play with the castle and figures, but for the money spent on these items (especially in comparison to some of the other Princess castles available), it was just way too dysfunctional. Ultimately this set was so disappointing that I packed it all back up along with the Magical Castle and returned everything.
B00DCRE83S|5.0|I saw Newsted on Friday in Broomfield Colorado and they flat out kicked some major ass. I always felt that Metallica treated him like crap. This album shows how much talent he has as a singer and how he still has the passion to play heavy metal. Buy this cd and you won't be disappointed.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|It's kinda fun. There aren't any instructions on how to excel in the bird races, fighting etc. They really want you to spend real money to buy aura to make the game move along. It seems pretty slow since I refuse to spend real money. However, the game is okay. I continue to play it. A little but at a time since it takes forever to build stuff. The game is free so go ahead and give it a shot. Oh you have to be hooked up to wireless to play.
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|Can't miss on this CD.  The opera has always been my favorite and I researched the different versions.  this is the very best.  Don't hesitate in buying this CD.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|This book was and is truly inspiring. I knew Miranda was a lovely soul but this book shows you into her life and how she has such a radiant personality that glows from the inside out. I hope she writes more books soon! Highly recommended.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|I can't tell if the game is any good because I haven't been able to play it. It constantly crashes on my Motorola Xoom while in the first room. It seems that I am not the only one with this problem. I should have read the reviews before installing it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This a fun game it entertains kids and adults . I would give it a 4 1/2 its not one hundred percent perfect but. Good
B00466HM28|5.0|Up to now, seems great product hope it holds for a long time, quality seems quite nice on the exterior, hope the interior parts have a long lifespan.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Never once have I read a book that made me cry and laugh as much as this one. This book made me think and feel things I have never experienced before. Thank you John Green for being such a brilliant writer and for giving me the pleasure of reading it. You're a genius. Please keep writing more books.... unlike Peter Van Houten.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I was impressed how many stars were in the movie and how well they did together. Cool movie and a must watch. Had some great action, lines and the acting was very good. Storyline was somewhat average.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|Downton Abbey, an Edwardian estate of unimaginable extravagance, is not immune as World War I takes its toll on the world. Like the rest of the world, the mansion and its people are at the disposal of the war effort. Life goes on at Downton, although much of it revolves around the sadness and devastation of war.<br /><br />This season presents a much less glamorous Downton, as the war and the consequent deaths take their tolls on the lives of the people. However, this season is no less enjoyable than the first. Exceptional photography, well-orchestrated, poignant dialogue, extremely talented actors, and dynamic settings, give us a realistic look at World War I's effect on all, the royalty and the servants alike.<br /><br />Although season two is, in many ways, very different from season 1, it is still exceptionally enjoyable to become wrapped up in the lives of these familiar characters. I highly recommend season two of Downton Abbey.
B0091JQH2Q|4.0|I tracked down this first Berglund cycle as many Sibelius fans rank it very highly.<br /><br />Overall, Berglund takes tempos slower than some are apt to be comfortable with. This gives the Fourth a necessary gravitas but sometimes weighs down other works, or portions thereof, but Sibelian majesty abounds aplenty. Berglund is fairly transparent with textures so that the strings don't drown out the woodwinds and timpani. The Second is played a little slowly for my taste, veering a little too close to sentimental when the grand sweeping melody arises and repeats. I much favor Beecham's approach here; propulsive, forceful, and devoid of sentimentality. The Fifth comes off beautifully. While most play up its heroism, Berglund infuses a pathos and sense of tragedy not often heard in this warhorse. A fresh take. The Seventh is a stellar interpretation, an intense, concentrated and seamless essay true to its single movement structure.<br /><br />The Bournemouth SO plays with inspiration, but these are not Bernstein's or Karajan's strings; in the opening movement of the First there is so much out of sync vibrato that one would think they're afflicted with tremors, and the team can't play together even at Berglund's modest pace. The recordings were done in the early 1970's and audio fidelity is clear. Overall a mixed bag. Sometimes rare items become \\"legendary\\" more for their absence than their greatness. Berglund's 2nd and 3rd Sibelius cycles are available, and rather than splurge on collectors prices for this, I'd suggest supplementing a collection with individual discs by Beecham (any), Barbirolli/RPO, Bernstein, Davis/BSO, Segerstam/Helsinki, Vanska, Karajan, and Maazel.<br /><br />Addendum:  I haven't heard the remastered EMI reissue and defer to the others on the remastered sound.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|Love is a Bourgeois Construct is the best song I've heard in years. The cards are stacked against it with a title like that but it turns out the song's driven by the words just as much as the music.<br /><br />The other songs are good too, different people will like different ones... Axis is like a dance in a laser gunfight, Fluorescent and Inside a Dream are sparse and polished and sound quite like the songs on Please.
B000GRUMPU|5.0|needless to say, he loves this movie.  The DVD is find, got it for a few dollars and free shipping.  No scratches or problems playing the DVD multiple times!
055358894X|5.0|THE LIES OF LOCKE LAMORA by Scott Lynch is an original, fun, and detailed fantasy caper-adventure.<br /><br />As you'd guess given the title, this is the tale of Locke Lamora, the young orphan who rose to become the leader of the Gentlemen Bastards, the smallest, cleverest, and most successful group of con artists in Camorr (a Venice-like city on a secondary world), going so far as to run a con against local nobles and the crime boss himself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Gray King has come to Camorr and is picking off leaders of the Camorri gangs. And next on his list? Locke Lamora. And from there, the Gray King has his sites on taking over the Camorri criminal underworld. Unless the Gentlemen Bastards can stop the Gray King, that is.<br /><br />Lynch weaves interludes into this main story: tales of Camorr, Locke's youth, and the training of the Gentlemen Bastards. These are largely entertaining, but sometimes they border on infodumps (albeit highly colorful and entertaining infodumps). And I did have an issue with the overall pacing. As this is a caper story, something has to go wrong and screw up Locke's con game. I was nearly 1/3 of the way through the book before the Gray King plot became a big issue for the Bastards.<br /><br />Of course, I had raced through that 1/3 because I enjoyed this world and the story. The characters are amusing, and the team dynamic is well crafted. Additionally, I loved Camorr. It's a vicious, romantic, and cinematic locale that leads itself to an over the top adventure tale.<br /><br />THE LIES OF LOCKE LAMORA is not without its faults, but the positive qualities of the characterization, world building, and the story telling. I read this story on the beach, and I couldn't have asked for a more entertaining tale.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Absolutely fun game. But patience is a must. And common sense.  But don't be in a hurry. This game takes time. But was super fun and exasperating.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love puzzles...I love this game...I want more!!!!!!! If you like random intricate puzzles, then this is for you.  I wish this game was longer!
B005544TRQ|5.0|The show is great and having it available on amazon.com is awesome.  Prime is the way to watch TV, cancelled Netflix.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love this game. My child also loves it. Very addictive. Surprisingly seeing as how it was free. Updates took a while but other than that happy.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Its Apple, thats all that needs to be said. High price, but very high quality. Its they way things should always be.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|I bought this cd as a gift for my niece. She can't take the cd out of the player. It was shipped quickly and price was great.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|The series is good, it starts out strong and there is some great story telling. As the series goes into the 3rd and the 4th book, the story telling starts to lag and there is too much repetitious background exposition. I also read the 5th book before making this review and I can say that my criticism exists after that volume as well. Mr. Martin needs to drive his over-arching theme toward a conclusion or his loyal readers will be greatly disappointed not to ever know how the story ends.<br /><br />I'm not sorry I read it, but it doesn't move forward after a while.
0345495004|5.0|This book was in great condition.  Will keep it as the book looks new and the story was quite enjoyable.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this show. It is one of the best lawyer shows on television. The characters are interesting, and so are the episode plots.
B008MEM24S|1.0|Never received the game. Ordered and paid for but was never downloaded and that really makes me mad ,because my grand kids want to play game.
0345803485|4.0|The book was for my daughter, she said it was a little too harsh of reading, she's  a college student and 21
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A lot of fun, if you like. task games. I like being able to take care of my horse the way I want to!
B00005JOA0|4.0|I thought The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was very well acted, especially by Toby Stephens and Rupert Graves.  A few of the small parts were also well done.  It feels slightly gray and dreary, but I assume that may come from the book that it is taken from, which I have never read.  Despite the somewhat slow and gloomy feeling, the viewer still experiences the unspoken (and spoken)  emotions that lie between the characters.
B00915G6YE|5.0|I can not tell you if you will like the show or not like I do.  But I can tell you is the product came fast and in great condition like they said it would.  5 stars to me!<br /><br />BTW I love the show.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Loved it. Needed another dozen episodes!  I don't know why there are no crickets, as one of them said. Should explain that!
1442366621|4.0|I was disappointed about the downloadable PDF they advertise and talk about.  I did not get that in my CD's. I would have been helpful to have those tools. I probably should have bought the book rather than CD’s.  It was motivating to listen to Michael.  They also talk about weight in ‘stones’ so it is hard to know what they are comparing.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|This app is really fun i love playing it. I just cant figure out what to do when the kid has a broken bone.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|Amazing. I watched it 2 times. I love Jack White and Jimmy Page. this was so well done we all loved it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the Crossfire trilogy. Gideon and Eva are so much in to each other and in love as well. Is there relationship like that in this day & age??
B008RXYOKY|4.0|It does what it's supposed to do. Looks good and works. Its Apple so what do you expect? Reliable and I hardly notice it its so small.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Rented this on a whim one night as my wife enjoys all Disney cartoons. Actually a great movie with great morals.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Gives you pretty much everything you need for all your weather needs. Covers all towns around the world. And good video coverage as well.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Really enjoyed the book, had a hard time putting it down. I can't wait to read the rest in the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game, it is so much fun!!! The only problem is that it can be very very addicting.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|I am so happy with Mel Pierce Camera.  I bought this film to take on vacation, it was a last minute purchase so I was afraid it might not arrive on time.  It actually came the day after the seller shipped it! One note on the shipping is Mel Pierce shipped from Hollywood, CA and I live in the greater Los Angeles area so shipping was bound to be fast; however, Mel Pierce Camera shipped the film the day after I ordered.  They are &#34;on the ball&#34; when it comes to their customers.<br /><br />The film itself seems good.  The expiration date is well beyond the day it arrived by like two years.  The instax film can be very expensive so if I can get it for under a dollar per sheet it's a decent price, with CA tax the 50 pack instax mini film came out to about .80 cents a sheet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book from the beginning.  It caught my attention right away.  I loved the style of writing but most of all, I loved the twist in the story.  It really took my by surprise.
B0049GYXDG|3.0|I love Alice in Wonderland so I was excited to buy the 60th edition.  The Blu-ray and DVD are fine but I was a little disappointed that the video it not come with the little cardboard &#34;dust cover&#34; that most Disney movies come with.  This video only came in the plastic clamshell case.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game :) I'm a big fan of playing card games and sometimes I can't find anyone willing to play with me. So being able to get on and play this game anytime I want is wonderful. Definitely a new favorite. :)
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and felt I was with Harold on every 'emotional' step of his pilgrimage. A wonderful debut novel and I'm now looking forward to reading Joyce's second novel 'Perfect'
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|I had actually first heard The Wall in 2004; since then I've learned more about it. Like how it's a loop, tied together by \\"Isn't this where we came in?\\" And how 'Comfortably Numb' has \\"the greatest guitar solo\\", as determined in a survey. What I've always known: everyone should listen, as a part of their musical education.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Awesome instructions,easy to follow. I thought this would be a great addition to the paracord projects I already know how to do
B008K9SG9K|4.0|Most people buy a CD knowing one or two songs from it. I knew three (and liked two- Radioactive and Demons). By the time I finished the whole thing I enjoyed five songs and was using it to relax enough after work to go to sleep.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|I loved this! A great read! Easily one of the better movie books I have read. This writer understands cinema deeply and knows how to break a scene down. There's some trivia but the focus here is on a serious look at what makes `Scarface' work creatively. Film students and screenwriters will love this but I also recommend it to anyone fascinated by the remarkable 1983 gangster classic. I have an even greater respect for 'Scarface' after reading this awesome book.
B000E6GBV2|4.0|If you want a CD with the lyrics printed for you- don't get this. If you want a 'corporate sound'- don't get this. If you want a folk band that you can listen to and repeat for hours (on the same day, or not)- Get This. (I especially enjoy 'The Funeral'.)
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is fun and not to challenging but has those puzzles that stump you. Its also gives you hints on those that may be a little to tricky.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Pines, like all his other books is awesome, there were several times throughout the book where i thought for sure i had it pegged, but was pleasantly proved wrong. This book is a lot different than his others but he is so versatile in his writing that he didnt miss a beat, please if you have never read any of his books, read this and i promise you will want to read his others. Crouch and King are about the only two authors that i read anymore. I cant wait for the sequel to this.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw these being sold for upwards of 200 dollars. Those stores should be ashamed of themselves! The device costs $35 plus tax and shipping on Google Play. I hope many read this and head to the Google Play store instead of buying from these ripoff artists. I intended to write down every store name that is trying to sell these for an outrageous price, and make sure I never shop there.
B005QYKD4I|3.0|the first one was the best, this was alright, the story line was not that good, i watched because of the graphic
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter, my son and I all have this game on our Kindle Fire HD and love it!! They got stuck for a few days when the update came out but working fine now. Must have for the whole family.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Our grand children encouraged us to read the book a couple of years ago.  It was originally intended for a younger audience, but my wife and I enjoyed it tremendously!.  This is a book that is extremely difficult to put down, once you start reading it. We had to see the film version and we did!  We just had to purchase the DVD - it was a must!  We are now anxiously awaiting the second book to come to life on the big screen in November of this year.  After we see it, we will undoubtedly purchase the DVD.  We highly recommend this disc for anyone looking for a great adventure that is very different.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|&#34;Scarface: The Ultimate Guide, by Damian Stevenson is the first movie guide book I've read. I enjoy watching the behind the scenes documentaries on TV about popular films and this book was no different. It's filled with interviews with the production staff, actors, film bloopers, interesting facts about the previously filmed movie with a similar plot, nuances about the history behind the storyline, and even who was considered to play in the rolls later owned by the actors that made this film the pop culture it is known to be today. I would highly recommend it to the Scarface movie fan!&#34;
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I purchased this series for my wife.  She loved the series when it was on TV.  I watch it with her and we both enjoy it immensely.  Peter Falk has a way of creating a character that seems to be so unaware of things, when he really does know what's happening.  He is a master at creating an illusion for those bad guys.  I wonder if there are actually police personnel like Columbo?
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This movie was intelligent, fun, sad, entertaining on all levels.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see a very lovely story involving people of a certain age with all their jealousies, insecurities along with their compassion, generosity, and loving-kindness. A real treat and treasure.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Fantastic for charging two devices in the car, and the price is awesome.  If you want to charge a phone and a tablet, look no further.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. It's challenging and I love puzzle games. I just wish they had hints for you from time to time but other than that its fun and its good for the brain.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Wasn't sure what to expect, lots of blood and violence, but a good story.<br />Enjoyed the old action characters!  Go Chuck Norris!!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|what more is there to say - watch it year round...might have to buy it again, I think it is stuck in the van DVD player.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Found the case to be well made and durable. Protects without adding too much bulk. Also like the band which ties down the cover or can be used to hold the device when open. No surprises.
B0025X4OYI|4.0|A listen into the past, with the highlights of Ray Charles venture into Country & Western music a definitive plus.
0425266060|5.0|I like getting box sets so I have the next one right there ready to read when I finish the prior book.  I must say these just get better and better.  Though not quite as edgy as Gray they read just as exciting and hot, hot, hot!!  Go Sylvia, I will stary with you till the end!!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|A phenomenal accomplishment, with all tracks most enjoyable. The banjo accompaniment makes for a unique listening experience.<br />The awards received were well earned.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love hill climb racing because of all the fun cars and levels, and there all so different. It's so much fun
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is a must read for people of all ages. The story of Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett is heartfelt and keeps you on your toes.

B00AWJYJVA|4.0|Carre has updated his standard concept to the world of today. That works fantastically and sets your mind going regarding the security policy dilemmas of today. His writing is still very pleasant to read and leaves you in a good mood when you are done
B00A27X972|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Very different, well written characters and unique plot.  You will find yourself thinking about it long after you have finished.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is fun for something to do when you want to be mindlessly stimulated.  At first the dialog is a little irritating, and because I've never played before there was a lot of hit and miss, but I improved after a while, and it became more interesting and fun.  I like the magical element of it.
0399159347|2.0|This review distresses me for I dearly love Ms. Moriarty's books. Three Wishes is my all time fav of the genre and What Alice Forgot is way up there too. That said, this book just didn't do it for me. As other reviewers have pointed out, the beginning of the book makes such rapid and total jumps between situations and characters it's a bit difficult to follow and frankly, a bit dull.<br /><br />The husband's actual secret is very inventive, creative, and intriguing and the book is well written from the point of revelation onward but still manages to be a bit dull. If this were another writer I'd probably have given the book a 3 star rating but Ms. Moriarty is just too wonderful and for her, this book is a 2 star.<br /><br />Ms. Moriarty's quirky, original, make you-roll-on-the-floor-laughing sense of humor seems to be missing in action in this book.<br /><br />I'm hoping for a Kettle squeal? Please, please, please?

0805092919|5.0|My 3 year old daughter loves the baby bear and also brown bear and friends.  She has speech delays and repetition books really help her. She feels confident and she can tell the story all by herself. I recommend as a good resource for children learning how to speak and read.
B00CDZM4QS|3.0|The recording of this live Ring Cycle from Vienna was dogged by controversy from the word go. The Ring is in more or less permanent repertory at the Staatsoper, with a cycle in the spring and one in late autumn/winter.<br />A new production will be ushered in by a \\"Star Conductor\\", who is then replaced after a year or two by less stellar though just as gifted conductors.<br />The current production was inaugurated by Franz Welser-Most, who was succeeded by Adam Fischer and Peter Schneider.<br />It could not have been more of a shock therefore when the 2011 autumn cycle was announced as being under Christian Thielemann than if it had been under Herbert von Karajan via a medium!<br />Furthermore, it was to be a gala project, recorded and filmed live (with no retakes) for intended commercial release, and to that end it was further announced that the orchestra would be the \\" A \\" team composed only of members of the Philharmonic-a true second VPO Ring! Tickets sold out in seconds.<br />After the rush of excitement, a creeping reality began to set in-what about casting? The pool of truly great singers of Wagner is a small one, (is there one?) and all houses struggle to assemble first rate casts across the board, and Vienna is no exception. An examination of the cast roused little enthusiasm, being composed of veterans, second string performers and few real stars.<br />However, at least Dalayman was cast as Brunnhilde-until she was taken ill and had to be replaced by Linda Watson at very short notice! Eric Halfvarson had to be replaced as Hagen by Attila Jun for Act 3, and Uusitala was also replaced late on in the rehearsal process by veteran Arnold Dohmen!<br />Filming stopped after Walkure-Oh Dear!-and it was announced soon after the final performance-that recordings would NOT after all be released!<br />There was anger and speculation mixed-had Welser-Most axed it in pique in his capacity as Music Director, had Thielemann vetoed it, and if so why?<br />There were of course suspicions as to why, but denials came from both camps and the debate raged on. Vigorous protests came from the orchestra, no doubt thinking of lost revenue.<br />Critics in Vienna had hailed the performances as the greatest artistic event in 50 years-international critics were less effusive-MUCH less effusive-so we in the wider public could only surmise that it probably wasn't as great an achievement as we might have hoped for.<br />Well, finally, after all the shilly- shallying, we can judge for ourselves!<br />Comparisons are inevitable with the Solti Vienna recording which is otherwise \\"hors concours\\", and Thielemann's own Bayreuth recording of 2010 from the 2008 deason which I reviewed on its release, and for which I expressed great admiration for the conductor's vision and particularly his sense of \\"architecture\\" with almost equal levels of disappointment for the lack of quality singing.<br /><br />I'll start by paying a compliment-this recording is not as disappointing as I had feared it would be.<br />Pretty much the same applies to this set as to the earlier 2008 live recording except that there is an ironic reversal of roles-those that are very finely sung on the Bayreuth set are here rather poor, and vice versa!<br />The recording is processed at 24Bits/96khz and is excellent in conveying a real impression of hearing the performance in this venue. The balance is inevitably different from the Bayreuth set, with the orchestral presence much more forward and making more of an impact-but those expecting the lush wrap around sound of the Solti/Culshaw recording will be disappointed as this recording highlights the artificiality of sound of the earlier set.<br />However, compared to other live recordings from the Staatsoper, particularly those on Orfeo, the sound is a little dry and airless at times. I won't overstress this as the there is a very realistic sense of presence about the recording which is pleasing, and the balance between voices and orchestrais excellent.<br />Stage noise is occasional but not over intrusive, as is occasional audience participation-applause at the end of acts is left in, as are the occasional (and in Vienna inevitable!) boos!<br />The orchestral sound is very different from that of Bayreuth, where the strings are very forward and the brass recessed. While the refulgent string tone is in full evidence, the resplendent Vienna Brass are major participants in the forefront-and magnificent they are too. In terms of sheer orchestral sonic impact, this set eclipses the earlier Bayreuth one. At times the weight of the brass sound is overwhelming. This is a live \\"warts and all\\" recording, not patched together from rehearsals (there were very few!) and alternative performances (there were none!) and there is occasional imprecision-more especially entry between singers and orchestra is not always spot on, but I'm being hyper-critical and there is little to cause raised eyebrows.<br />The transfer is at quite a low level, meaning that a volume boost is probably required which in turns risks damage to equipment -and the ears-when the many climaxes are reached.<br />I found Thielemann's sense of architecture to be superb, even revelatory in the earlier recording-and so it proves again here. I was time and again reminded of Knappertsbusch at his best-not AS slow, but Thielemann understands the ebb and flow of the drama better than any of his contemporaries, and the orchestral sound world is just perfect. He even emphasises even more the big rallentando he makes before the final statement of the Walkure motif in the Walkurenritt-pure Kna-I love it!<br />What Thielemann understands so well are the \\"big moments.\\"<br />So many of these pass for little or naught under Janowski and Gergiev, but in this set they raise the hairs on the neck as they should.<br />So far then, it's all rather fine. Now we come to the singing.<br />It would be easy for me to yet again launch into a tirade against the lamentable standard of Wagner singing that is inflicted upon us today, and more especially the level of critical approval that it receives-but I'm going to take a philosophical approach accepting that we are where we are, and the stark choices are to perform the music with the best that's available-or not to perform it at all. In this context, this Ring is not bad at all-indeed much of it is very well sung by any standard!<br />I greatly enjoy Dohmen's Wotan in the Haenchen recordings, but find his Bayreuth assumption reliable but rather prosaic.<br />In this recording he is-superb! Veteran he may be, but his vocal resources are in fine fettle in this Ring, his frequent piano singing is truly beautiful, and his sense of the drama is superb.<br />Hi Rheingold Wotan is masterful-he reaches the heights with steady assured<br />tone, his Walkure Wotan is noble, angry and moving by turns, and his Wanderer is just wonderful. Yes, there are barks, snatched notes, exaggerations-this is what one always hears in the opera house. His assumption for me ranks with the very best.<br />Das Rheingold fares well in general-Konieczki's Alberich performance is more to my taste than was his Wotan-well sung and superbly crafted as a really nasty Nibelung indeed. I still find a rather disturbing nasal quality to his tone, but it is quite fitting his characterisation in this instance. He's not Neidlinger or Wolfgang Koch-but he's very good indeed, as are the beautifully sung and acted, on pitch Rhinemaidens. Janine Baechle's Fricka is less hectoring and more studied in her berating of Wotan for his stupidity, Freia sings well instead of screeching, Donner and Froh are excellent and as are the admittedly rather grainy sounding giants, who nonetheless impress with the weight of tone and their acting. Adrian Er&ouml;d is a local Viennese baritone who is considered a star in that city-and rightly so for his assured beautiful singing and excellent dramatic skills more than warrant his reputation.<br />HisValentin in Faust can be heard on the Orfeo recording from Vienna I reviewed some years ago (I was at the performance!), but here we find him in what I believe is the unique situation of being cast as a baritone Loge.<br />The range does not trouble him in the slightest, but the darker quality to the voice makes this loge a much more formidable character indeed-there is much more scorn and menace in the voice. This is a real tour-de-force.<br />Wolfgang Schmidt, a recent Siegfried, adopts a \\"comedy voice\\" for Mime. The squawking exaggerations work quite effectively in his brief appearance here, though not later. Anna Larsson's Erda is very fine and assured, and not too \\"plummy.\\"<br />I count this Rheingold as a major success, and Walkure is only slightly less so.<br />Christopher Ventris as Siegmund is no Kaufmann, never mind Vickers or King (I won't mention Melchior or it will bring on tears), but his lighter voiced , l lyrical Siegmund gains strength and confidence as the first act progresses, and he is as good as Wottrich on the Bayreuth set. He doesn't sustain the final \\"W&auml;lsungenblut\\" for more than a second, but this is not in the score and is only grandstanding by the tenor-but it is sadly missed!<br />He is partnered by the veteran Waltraud Meier. My heart sank when I heard her opening tremulous rather strangulated notes- I need not have worried, for she not only recovers but launches into the higher strata of this role with absolute assuredness, and a brilliant rock steady legato that is a joy to hear.<br />Like all natural mezzos who have \\"bigged up\\" to soprano, there is a slight tremulousness in the middle register, but the committed acting banishes all thoughts of this. It is a truly thrilling performance, not least in Acts 2 and her big moment in Act 3 is hair raising (in the best sense!)<br />Halfvorsen is a mediocre wobbly Hunding-not too bad in this role-Baechle's Fricka is again excellent, and I have already alluded to Dohmen's truly inspired Wotan. The Valkyries have never been bettered-they are utterly superb in every respect.<br /><br />Katarina Dalayman is the best Brunnhilde in this work since possibly Nilsson!<br />She has a lighter voice than Stemme-but none of the wobble. From her first entry and her very cleverly crafted \\"Hojo to ho's \\" to her final pleadings with Wotan, she is utterly superb. The act 2 \\" Todesverkundigung\\" scene can become a drag, but her nobility and brilliant singing make it seem too short.<br />Thank goodness we now have her Walkure Brunnhilde to complement her Gotterdammerung performance for Elder.<br />So, a fine Walkure which is let down only by having a very good rather than knockout Siegmund, and a wobbly Hunding. I will return to it frequently.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes or so of Siegfried are appalling. The strangulated caterwauling of both Schmidt and Stephen Gould is truly abysmal, with little or no attempt (or ability?) to sing any of the written notes. The entry of Wanderer brings things back to an even keel, and Schmidt finds the voice to sing more of his responses to Dohmen's excellent Wanderer.<br />Then a minor miracle takes place-Stephen Gould returns and has found some steady tone to finish off the act with hardly a shout, and he delivers a passable forging song, though I wish his Mime would shut up-a pity he didn't behead him there and then. The audience erupts into cheers-whether this is because the noise has stopped, or it is an expression of genuine pleasure I am not sure.<br />Gould does have more ring to his voice in the second part of this act than he did in Bayreuth, and he continues to improve in Act 2 where after a thrilling confrontation between Alberich and the Wanderer, he croons his way through the Forest Murmurs quite effectively. Don't get me wrong-it's not great, just not terrible which is in these times the best we can expect. The Woodbird is a triumph-just beautiful. This is Gould's best act.<br />Act 3 commences with a raging orchestral storm leading into a moving and terrifically well sung scene between Erda and the Wanderer, and in fairness Gould is not bad in the confrontation with his Grandfather.<br />Sadly, Ms Dalayman became ill after Walkure and was replaced at the eleventh hour by Linda Watson, whom I castigated for her rotten singing in the Bayreuth set. She is in totally different voice here, and delivers a very well acted, technically accomplished Brunnhilde. Her voice is not beautiful in the way of Dalayman, but she sings well with her vibrato under control-mostly.<br />It takes two to tango and to duet-I'll draw a veil over this final duet-I won't be returning to it anytime soon!<br /><br />Gotterdammerung starts with superb Norns, has first class chorus work, the same excellent Rhinemaidens and a fine Waltraute in Baechle again.<br />The Dawn and Siegfried's Rhine Journey are to cheer for, as is the orchestral contribution throughout. Linda Watson's Brunnhilde starts pretty well and improves exponentially through the work culminating in a very fine Immolation scene indeed. Stephen Gould is in the best voice I have heard him, and although he (and we) suffer in his Act 3 narration, he is otherwise not bad and actually does a fine Siegfried's Death-the Funeral Music is sensational with Thielemann unleashing the full force of the magnificent orchestra.<br />Having given us a fine Donner, Markus Eiche gives us a truly memorable Gunther-weak, vacillating and dominated by his well sung sister Gutrune and Hagen, and the Alberich is very well taken again<br />Eric Halfvorsen returns for the role of Hagen in Acts One and Two, but is replaced by Attila Jun (Elder's Hagen) for Act 3.<br />I'll assume that Halfvorsen was in vocal difficulties from the outset, because I find him all but unlistenable. Not only is he incapable of sustaining any phrase, he cannot produce sufficient tone. The only word I can use -being generous-is awful. He manages after a fashion with the more conversational elements of the role, but as soon as he has to force his tone, the voice breaks down. The Act 2 summoning of the vassals is painful.<br />It begs the question not only why did the Staatsoper not substitute the superior Jun for the entire role, and indeed why did they engage Halfvorsen at all? Admittedly they are used to unsteady basses in Vienna-Kurt Rydl was principal bass for nigh on 2 decades, and he always had a wobble that registered on the Richter scale, but at least the sheer volume and intimidating characterisation carried the day. When one thinks of previous essayers of this pivotal role such as Frick, Greindl, Ridderbusch and Salminen, one could weep! It seems that the pool of great basses is as shallow as it is for Heldentenors and Dramatic sopranos-in 2013, veteran John Tomlinson is singing Hagen in this production!!!!<br />Matters improve when Jun takes over in Act 3, and it is a fine conclusion to the cycle. I have already alluded to Siegfried's death, but Linda Watson gives us a very fine Immolation scene, touching and thrilling in equal measure-yes, there is an occasional wobble, but not enough to detract from the overall excellence of her performance. Thielemann gives us a wonderful cataclysmic finale, and the orchestra really rises to the occasion.<br />There is included in the very attractive packaging a comprehensive booklet with translated libretti, and 2DVD's which comprise documentary films on each segment of the production-the scenes shown might be seen as a warning rather than an encouragement as Vienna too has succumbed to the tyranny of \\" Regie Theater\\" for its new productions.<br />So what is the final conclusion? A superb Rheingold is partnered by a very fine Walkure followed by a deeply flawed but ultimately serviceable Siegfried and a fine Gotterdammerung whose qualities just survive the vocal inadequacies to which I have referred.<br />The 2008 Bayreuth recording was patched together from rehearsals and 3 performances each of the works, and as result ensemble is crisper overall.<br />On the other hand, the sheer impact of the VPO eclipses that of Bayreuth.<br />Vocally it is swings and roundabouts with Vienna just winning out despite the excellence of K&ouml;nig in the Bayreuth set. Dalayman, Dohmen and Er&ouml;d are simply stunning, and other cast members are mostly excellent.<br />Therefore, I would just recommend this over the earlier set, and as an added bonus it is much less expensive and has the DVD extras.<br />The Vienna Critics were wrong-it was not the artistic event of the decade-I've heard better performances of all but Rheingold in Vienna over the years.<br />I can see why it was planned not to release it-or rather I can hear why.<br />Even though by today's standards it's a pretty good effort, sadly that's not saying much!<br /><br />Seekers after a VPO Ring should stick with Solti. Seekers after their first recording should opt for the newly mastered Bohm on Eloquence.<br />This is for diehards only-and of course Thielemann admirers. There is much to admire, probably just more than there is to deplore, so I award it 3.5 stars, just above the Bayreuth set. Stewart Crowee Valkyries have never been bettered-they are utterly superb in every respect.<br /><br />Katarina Dalayman is the best Brunnhilde in this work since possibly Nilsson!<br />She has a lighter voice than Stemme-but none of the wobble.

It's a game that challenges your memory skills and may even make you question your own thought process. Magic academy 2 is a great game.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I have always been fascinated by the work of Walt Disney!  So impressive for his time.  This movie has much detail in the backdrops, which I know had to take hours to develop.  I loved this movie when I was a little girl.  I watched it over and over and over.

B00CXQL828|5.0|Every few years a great album (with all that this word implies) is released. This is one of those times. Trying to avoid the \\"Music was so much better before, the music now sucks\\" syndrome, I am always on the hunt for something new and good. I ususally find some good stuff every now and then, but sometimes I find something really great. This album is one of those times.  I now I will be listening to this CD for a long time and I'll be coming back to it often. Plainly amazing.<br /><br />If you are a drummer, is a must buy.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|Brynner is masterful.  Here is a compelling tale of progress gone awry...a Terminator before Arnold announced &#34;I'll be back!&#34;  Brynner proves himself as absorbing a character as ever lurched across a sci-fi screen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game and it takes up lots of spare time and when I'm bored or I need something to make time fly I go on subway surfers and before I know it an hour's gone fast!

B009KS4XRO|1.0|Thisgame used to be fun but since they changed it, its not anymore. They have made winning a game so much harder and they don't give out shadows anymore to complete you room. I know its free but they rip you off for credits all the time and it freezes a lot more now. I wish they would put it back to the way it was. I play it because I have already got it downloaded but I wouldn't get it if I hadn't got it already!  Too bad, was an awesome game. Not anymore. Don't waste your time.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Very Nice Game!!!  I can tell when the game pieces are locked, the other game locked up and had to try all the tiles to see if they played.  On this game u can clearly see what would play...
B000J10KTG|1.0|I bought this gift for my husband. So it went a couple of weeks without being used. Whenever he put it into his PlayStation 3 it was not recognized by the system. Also our regular Blu ray player did not recognize this disk. I thought the price was a good deal but it turned out to be a bust!!!  I never contacted the seller because of the amount of time that have passed and because the price was so low for the item.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Fun movie, just don't take it too seriously. My teenagers loved it, they are 13 and 14, and it was right up their alley!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Some levels are a little harder than others but my 6 year old got me through them. Lol.  So it appeals to all ages.
0425252868|5.0|Read review before purchase and loved story, that there still are caring considerate people in the world. Loved reading of lives leading up to the actual event.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|You can download candy crush saga game at 1 mobile market for free. All games are free. Go to 1mobilemarket.com. hope this helps for all of you trying to find it on amazon app store for  kindle, or any other android device.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book really kept my attention.  I couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to read the third one!  Very exciting.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|it's ok. very touching but still not what i expected. need more wholesome values in the movie for me to like.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is fantastic I can't find the words to explain it. Thank you Stephan Chbosky for allowing me to be able to connect with a book as wonderful as this one.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This Battery HD free app has been a great one on my Kindle Fire HD. I really like it. It gives you a lot of different battery times.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|One of the best books I have read in some time.  It is a well-written window into North Korea and a great human story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game awesome game great great great great wow wow ten more words to go now only five good bye
0099519852|5.0|Highly recommended. Learn what happens in your brain when learning something new and why you have to keep pushing through
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|just downloaded on my gen 1 kindle, so far so good. Great game, love the zen mode for continues play. This is a game in it's own, not to be compared to tetris, fun intertainment and a great way to kill some time.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|I believe this may be the very first time I have not been happy with Amazon.  Normally you guys are the best on everything !!  When I brought this movie up and purchased it, I thought I was buying a DVD at your usual great prices.  I had no idea I was actually purchasing something that would be in some kind of Cloud Library, that could be recalled at a later date.<br /><br />It could very well be that this is the wave of the future and I will be happy watching this on my iPad when I am out of town or something but the marketing is unclear.  Well either the marketing is unclear or I am just not very smart.  I will think long and hard before I spend 15 bucks for something to be stored in the Cloud.  Is there a way to see what all you have in there?<br /><br />Other than a hick-up at the beginning of the movie when I had to reboot and start over it was a very good movie and I really liked it.<br /><br />Mike Mayberry
B000X8KGQM|5.0|I liked the three themes and how they were interwoven in each piece. The music made the movie in my opinion
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I ordered this device to assist me with transferring my video from my video camera to my laptop.  It works well and is what I needed to perform the task.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun and addictive.  Once you get the hang of it you won't be able to put it down.  Consider yourself warned.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|I began reading this book days after I visited the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam.  The diary is so well written - I could imagine the sites, smells, terror, helplessness, and despair, as well as, the feelings of hopefulness, courage, and love. We must never forget and never repeat this history.
B0089LOG02|5.0|As a book group of eight, we all enjoyed the book. It was amazing to learn that this<br />went on for so many years.  The relationship between Vivian and Molly added muh<br />to both their lives.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is one of those books you should read so that you'll know what everyone is talking about at parties, not because it is the greatest novel ever written or even close to it.  The first third of the novel is a fairly slow build and then the first plot twist happens.  This makes for a great middle section.  The end, which I hated, is still suprising and I give points for that even if I didn't like the suprise.  The strangest thing is that you will HATE almost every character in this book but it is still a fairly entertaining read.  In short, I liked it but will never re-read it.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|What is there not to like? Kanye West has taken a different turn in Hip Hop for the better. c
B002RV01QI|5.0|If you're an Enya fan, you will enjoy this CD. It contains all the favorites plus a new, extra track. It's nice to have a CD with all of Enya's best recordings. Great listening any time!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An amazing story and exceptionally well written book.  Nearly impossible to put down....will read all works by Adam Makos asap.
B008Y5UADK|4.0|I like these kind of movies; a bit off the beaten path.  I thought it was cleverly done, despite being or appearing to be very low budget.  Not quite David Lynch (Eraserhead) cult classic, but I would watch it again
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is fantastic. I wasn't able to put the book down for days. Can't wait to read the next book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the app it is great to play with my little brother and he loves the movie despicable me so he was so excited when I showed him this game, its all he plays.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I only rate high the things I like.  So far I have ordered four sets, I like them all. Excellent service.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed Landay's writing style, and throughout the story I found myself wondering what I would do or think as a parent in his situation.I. have already recommended it to friends
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great really Frunze and full of excitement I really enjoy the game and I think u would to have fun
B00ANA27IU|5.0|If you have seen the movie then you must read this book. It ties everything together so much better. Can`t wait to read the next one.
B0015RB72W|5.0|Got the lp in the mail the other day and all I can say is, wow! It sounds pretty amazing on vinyl! Don't know what those other reviewers are saying, that it sounds the same as the CD, etc. Not like my TT is that great, nor is it at all shabby: a Rega P3, and I have a decent CD player too: an Arcam. There is much more detail in the notes of music coming from instruments, and Duffy's voice seems louder and more pronounced, but not so much as to be abrasive. As well as a clear seperation between the singer's vocals from the intruments, beats/samples, etc. To me the detail really came through in the title track \\"Rockferry\\" Seriously, if you like the music, and have the option of listening to it on vinyl, just do it already!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Was surprised with the quality of writing, special effects and action in this show. Was expecting a teen romantic DRAMA, but instead got a fast passed show with quick and witty dialogue, people who come across as real, and characters that you can root for.<br /><br />would recommend for fans of Buffy, Supernatural and Leverage.
B00498YZFK|5.0|We recently watched this on Amazon Prime the other night and loved it! My wife and I both have enjoyed everything she has done, including The Hunger Games and Silver Linings Playbook so we thought we would watch the movie that launched her career. Wow, what a performance at 20 yr.s old in a slow burn, tensioned filled movie. You can literally see her becoming one of the greatest actress of our time unfolding over the course of the movie.<br />If you need adreline filled spectacles, this one isn't for you but if you like great performaces then you can't go wrong, highly recommened!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I've been a satisfied owner of a withings scale for about a year, and for a long time I've thought about purchasing a activity tracker. So when I heard about the Pulse, I was instantly interested..  Especially at the thought of being able to have both weight and activity measures collected in the same interface. I pre ordered the device and got it about a month later. I've been using it since and I've been very satisfied. I love the long battery life, and withings healtmate app works perfectly. The sleep tracking seems pretty accurate most of the time and hopefully it'll improve further once new firmwares are released.
B0053O89IS|5.0|This show has kept me and many of my friends entertained for a long time.Keep it up Booth,Bones and crew!!!!
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|In a world of brilliant guitar players there is Richard Thompson... the man is incredible! Love his voice too. From the Fairport Convention days to 'electric' he has honed his craft like no other.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you have to get this game<br />it is awesome and fun to play<br />log in to face book and come play with me today
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I wish it was a little clearer in instruction i had a hard time figuring out what i was supposed to do on some of them
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Pretty straightforward setup.  Once setup, easy to use.  Very.  Works with netflix, youtube, or google play.  Controlled it from my smartphone, easily (HTC DROID DNA).  Hope they add more streaming services in the future.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|What more can you say about a movie like this? I wish I would have caught it on the big screen with the amazing special effects. Still good even on an ipad.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun little game. Just because the premise is simple, don't think this is super easy. It is a fun challenge that can be played in bite-sized bits. Enjoying the game.
6305428271|5.0|Would recommend this movie for all teens to view.  Very informative and encouraging.  Full of heart.  Everyone should own thismovie.
B0087OUAFQ|5.0|I bought the Up All Night Live Tour Dvd, Second Hand and it came as if it were brand NEW! and the dvd and dvd case were incredible! and it came in very fast shipping! I will buy from again! and it came with the Tour Card/Vip pass that its supposed to came with so i'm very pleased about that!
1781162646|4.0|Not one of Stephen King's greatest effort yet it was spell binding.  I nearly cried at the ending but it is the way the story had to go.  I have been a Stephen King reader since I first read The Shining and I went back and read the ones he wrote before that.  He does have the ability to make my hair stand on end!!
B007JXJ962|1.0|You sent me the regular version of the album it was supposed to come with the special edition collectible cards and it didn't the shipping/packaging is very bad and you can not say, &#34;i didn't know which album&#34; or what it needed inside because it says right on the order with Collectible cards and it came in a week. I'm not impressed!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read alot of crime drama and can usually predict wbat's coming.  Not this one!<br />I was intrigued from the first page.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This is a breath of fresh air. Great read. Would recommend this to all. Have some very strong parts that make you think.
0060207051|5.0|What a wonderful story to read to your little one at bedtime.  Goodnight moon is one of those books that transcend generations.  The simply drawn illustrations and Margret Wise Brown's simple words make a classic.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A story that takes you through generations of a family torn apart by poverty, war and customs. It is a compelling  and emotional read. The characters are so real that. I feel that Iknow them and would love to make everything right for them. I am so glad I read this book - amazing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super cute game!  I like that you can customize it for the age of the player!  Sounds and graphics are a lot of fun!<br />Highly recommend this one!  Very entertaining!
B008476HBM|5.0|I love the setting, and language of the book!!! I must admit it seemed a little long, but it was totally worth it!!! It's a great story of love and romance, there is something in it for almost everyone! The book has altered my perception of people, the developed of Mr. Darcy is so fantastic, he goes from a surly, unlikable character, to one that any girl would kill for. If you like this book you should definitely check out Mr. Darcy's Diary, by Amanda Grange. It tells the whole story from Mr. Darcy's perspective. You may find that your opinion of certain characters shifts a little. But a definite must read for anyone who likes books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If u rated 1 star ur screwed up! I love this game it's great for all ages and a blast to play. I've played all the sandbox games (survivalcraft terreria and much more)<br />And this is by far the best sandbox game out !! It needs some improvements but it's still fabulous. I also recommend downloading the pc version it's more expensive but much better gameplay. I hope u download it immediately and give the best possible rating u can!! I think u should find this review helpful! If not there's nothing I can do :(
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play and customize to suit your taste. Can be as easy our as challenging as you like. I recommend this version for hours of relaxing fun.
B0024CEY36|5.0|My favorite Author Ken Follett never fails me.  Always on top of his game.  A wealth of information in every book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like Facebook.You can keep up with your friends. And family.You can also post pictures.I recommend people to do this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the hungry games series and I cried at every page and then I ate dinner because it made me so hungry.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have never played g5 games before and this game was one of the best games I have played I wish it didn't end so soon
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter loves this game. She plays it for hours on end. It has never locked up or had any problems. Get it for your kids.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This is a great cover. Good quality. My only complaint is that it doesn't hold it in the standing position very well. It tends to slide down.
B008645YH6|4.0|I bought this item for my 16-year-old daughter. She loves it! The tunes get stuck in your head and I have since heard them on a variety of television shows and movies. I enjoy the cd myself. The delivery was well ahead of time and I am happy!
B007REV4YI|2.0|I am an avid James Bond fan have seen (more than once) and own every 007 movie made - but this truly is not a good \\"James Bond\\" movie. It began when Bond's gun didn't work right or he was out of ammunition at the very beginning of the movie - major blunder. Then a few minutes later, his assistant took a shot at him - of course by mistake - to which Bond falls into the depth of the ocean. I don't want to spoil the plot (what little there is of it) for those of you who have not yet seen the movie.<br /><br />My personal opinion is the movie was rather \\"dark and stinky\\" - - - which kind of translates into a bad word unfortunately.  Just not a fun film to watch and that's what Bond movies typically have been since 1960s, fun, full of intrigue and excitement, this was pretty much a downer from beginning to end with tons of special effects thrown in to make sure that people didn't get up and walk out at the movie theater, I suppose.<br /><br />Though it's quite obvious that quite a few people enjoyed this movie, by the high ratings, so there are those who obviously liked it, but for those older folks like me who grew up on Bond movies - it's just not up to par and I didn't care for the movie - the only good part about the movie was the song, in my opinion.
B00006FDCD|4.0|I watched this one time and admittedly it had been a long time since I had seen it, but I am not sure it is the whole movie which, if I remember right, was shown in episodes on television. Not to say that this is the seller's fault, I am just unsure. I probably should watch it more closely next time I view it. The movie arrived on time and in good condition. Nice Job!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|setup went ok, it took it a few times for it to log on to my wifi.<br /><br />my real issue has been buffering, often and for long periods of time.  now before you go right to &#34;oh, your wifi signal is weak&#34; its not. roku works fine, as does my laptop and mobile devices. there are no actions you can take to pause or refresh the chromecast to help it along, nor see what the signal looks like. at one point, i had to unplug it and plug it back in. it really could use a UI on the mobile device or computer to see whats going on.<br /><br />i got the netflix deal, so for $11 im not going to rage, and i assume the bugs will get worked out as the updates come along.<br /><br />if you have a streaming device thats working for you (roku, console, server, etc.) stick with it for now.
0762777931|5.0|I love this book and use frequently.  The layout of the book is brilliant.  Information is in small pieces making it a quick, easy reference book.
0679446230|5.0|This is a five star must read book for everyone, the thought that some people gave this a one star is just beyond me. The audacity. One of my favorite lines of all of literature is found in this book, when the King describes his son as cold impotent ash. That is what literature is all about.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Very nice product. works perfect out of the box. windows 8 compatible 100%. Totally recommend for laptops without a NIC.
1451673442|5.0|One of the best books I have read - full of wonderful ideas to change your life!  Definitely exceeded my expectatations!<br />!
B004LROUW2|5.0|Compelling from the beginning to the end.  Wonderful mix of possible and im(???)possible.  Gradually allows the reader to discover the mysteries surrounding the characters and the action.  Deeply developed characters; highly creative, imaginative story line.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game since it was challenging but not so much so that it gave me flashbacks to taking my mom's algebra 2 class
B0042RUMIW|5.0|I saw the similar concert in 2011 Japan. I like the way Sting tells the story behind each song. Berlin had a great audience as well.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I really liked this movie and I didn't think I was going to. It was totally unbelievable and so...wrong at times, but it was a cute story of love conquers all.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|40 minutes of swashbuckling fun with a morale at the end.  Reminds me of my wasted youth in front of the black and white
B005LAIH2M|5.0|This was a good movie, I would like to see it again, but I have 2 small children at home and by the time I get them to sleep at night I am often too tired to stay up for a whole movie, it is not a movie appropriate for children, and even some older people may find it offensive, but once you get past the language and nudity and violence, it was a good movie.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|I was actually one of the few who saw this in theatres as it departed very quickly.  Renee Zellweger is a believable Brit and Ewan McGregor gives a sensitive performance.  A shame, because it is a sweet tale told with charm with the bonus of beautiful English countryside scenery. Wish there were more  small, gentle films like this in circulation.
B0000029LG|5.0|This is an amazing album and Michael really gave his all to this project! I really believe it's over looked by the media because of all the tabloid junkie and lies that was around the name Michael Jackson during this period of his life..either way this album holds up and contains alot of great pieces of work..we miss u michael
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What can I add about this series? It has marvelous acting, stunning costumes and a stiff upper lip humor. Maybe not the cup of tea for some American viewers, but a delight for fans!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|WOW<br />The great tumblers of the universe waited 40 years to release this music upon us. Rodriquez is a shaman and a poet with a great guitar style!!<br />It's a must have...like Sgt Pepper or Joni Mitchel's &#34;Blue&#34; or Neil Young's &#34;Harvest&#34;.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|i don't understand why people are so angry towards this book, it's so freaking good, it's pace is slow certainly but it was expected.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cable arrived at the promised time, and worked exactly like it was expected to work. I hooked it up to my Kindle and the rapid charger with no problems.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|After scanning 100+ customer reviews, I decided on this Anker car charger VS the other brands that also get many reviews. My fiancee and I often charge both iPhone 4 & 4s simultaneously while heading to our favorite kayaking/camping sites around New England. I am a manufacturing engineer producing state-of-the-art circuit boards so I keyed into the separate power supplies for each port on this charger. I also liked the sleek design. My expectation was met when the Anker arrived and I plugged it into the cigarette lighter. Compact, well made, runs cool, and charges perfectly.
1401938906|5.0|Wayne Dyer recommended this book -bought a copy for my father and<br />I.  What an interesting and spiritual read for all of us!
0345529057|4.0|I have not completed the series yet but I helps me keep track of who is who in the series
B002WY65W4|4.0|This BLU-RAY version of Zombieland does come with a Digital Copy. But unfortunately the Digital Copy must be redeemed by 2/2/11, apparently no matter when you purchased it.
B00008EY7H|5.0|Amazing video features! This is a must-see show for all humans. I am considering getting the Blu-Ray to improve the quality!
B001TCHDPS|4.0|This is a good follow-up to Cold Fact.  I'm glad I purchased it along with the film.  Good to listen to while driving.
B000SFD21Q|5.0|My daughter gave this to me for a gift...what a transformation it will make in my life...especially the chapters on &#34;Depression&#34; and &#34;Addiction&#34;....PLEASE BUY THIS BOOK...IT will make a HUGE difference in your life!!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I understand completely why this film received the best documentary Oscar.<br />It holds up well when viewed repeatedly.<br /><br />Some people object to some of the lyrics.  I think they were quite appropriate to the time when the songs were written.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Even depressed &#34;freeky deekies&#34; like ME have hope for a &#34;normal&#34;, wonderful life...THANK YOU &#34;SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK&#34; creators/actors, DIRECTORS AND PRODUCERS...GOD LOVE YOU FOR MAKING US &#34;WHACKO'S&#34; FEEL good!!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|As a native Detroiter I found this story fascinating.  Loved the music in the film and am happy that Rodriguez will be paid royalties from today's releases.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this game it's totally better then anything else I have ever played. Temple run is ok but subway suffers is the best.
B00BRH2MN8|2.0|I got her EP because I heard Royals and absolutely loved it. So I thought what the heck lets just get the whole EP. I'm kind of disappointed. All of the other songs are really boring and repetative. Not my favorite choice of songs. I find myself constantly skipping over her EP. Sorry Lorde, but the EP was kind of a let down
B008XG1X18|3.0|I can't seem to get to all the places I want<br />maybe the kindle screen is too small<br />im not sure.
B00DU74U74|3.0|This movie was okay.  I made the mistake of reading the book first so the movie just didn't live up to my expectations.
B00CIS1OKW|5.0|Watched this with my son and we both loved it. I was concerned about how the graphics would look but they were great. Wasn't too predictable. Will watch again soon.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I wanted to see it when it was available in the theatres, but missed it. Now, I've seen it. It is geared to a younger audience than I am.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love  this game . It's awesome, fun and super  cute. I like it because  you get  your  own horse and you can take care of it .  You can get awards. And get more horses....
0425263924|1.0|Get out while you are still on top.  This could so have ended with the third book.  I have no intention of buying, or for that matter even borrowing, the next two books.  What a shame Ms. Day; you could have gone out on top of Fifty Shades, now you have become to me one of those romance writers who has 700 words for the male parts and absolutely no decent story line.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Much more fun online rather using a deck of cards, and it can travel anywhere your KINDLE FIRE can go.  Easy to play, and games are brief.  A GOOD GAME.<br />Go to Amazon.com for your copy, too.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Loved, loved the last two books he wrote.  This book went in to many directions, and lost me.  stopped reading it half way through.  Dissapointed.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is now my favorite TV show of all time.  So happy to have the entire series!
006114665X|4.0|The Sleepwalkers is a detailed and profound revisiting of the WWI causes.  Its emphasis on the Serbian conflicts with Austria put emphasis on a part of the War's causality which is frequently overlooked.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is now my favorite TV show of all time.  So happy to have the entire series!
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|Great first release for the new album.<br />PSB is my favorite &#34;band&#34;. They've never lost their way. I wish they did more but I know they are possibly winding down. Too bad.
B003L77G6A|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is now my favorite TV show of all time.  So happy to have the entire series!
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I really enjoy exercising my brain in the morning with this app.  Also playing Hangman with my grandchildren is such fun! Thank you.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Good selection of stations and fairly reliable playback. Two things bugbme though one is that it never auto quits when no stream is played. I would like a configurable setting to autoquit after some duration of time with no playback. Another is the silly &quot;are you sure you want to quit&quot; reminder. I would like to be able to turn that off.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game all the time and I love it. IT IS AWESOME. I highly recommend it for almost anyone! Again, awesome!
B0073CCYAM|5.0|kids love it!  smaller than regular us sized &#34;Cars&#34;.  Great seller too, no problems.  Sent cookies with the cars, we got 2.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you love this game, I would recommend Survivalcraft. its almost as good as this. except there's no cake or upside-down stairs.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Had issues with a generic cord I bought.......stick to Amazon's cord.  It is worth the few more dollars it costs over an off name one.
B00E0ZEDI6|4.0|If Owl City had a baby, these songs would be played before bedtime.  This EP is very chill and not technically acoustic, but I guess acoustic is an appropriate name for it since it's so different than Owl City's typical style.  My favorite song is &#34;Hey Anna.&#34;  I'm pretty sure it was written for me...  As would any other girl who can relate to it.
B005V5WBFG|3.0|This app offers a free trial of a paid service. I have McAfee on my computer and love it. I tried this app for a few days and it worked fine. I was even able to manage the app online with my McAfee subscription. Unfortunately, I changed phones about a week or so after the download. I wasn't planning of buying the full version of this app, as there are many free options that work well on mobile phones, so no, I didn't download it again to my new device.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is the best game I've ever played on the kindle. I recommend to get this game, it's just so fun that I can't stop playing it! :)
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My grandson (19 months) loves Tom.  Tom is his favorite &#34;on the go&#34; toy.  Easy to operate and keeps him entertained.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was hard at times but not in an impossible way. Very addictive and a great app to download if you feel you need something to refresh your brain!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|There are lots of different elements and games to keep your attention.  The story is pretty good too. Nice graphics.
B0026IPAJA|5.0|Easy to download on my IPad.  Wonderful movie! I will definitely buy more movies through Amazon Instant movies! Very pleased with product!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Kindle fires have glitches with this game but other then that the game is cool. Please fix it!!! Xx !!!

B00A7CI82I|4.0|Another great action packed adventure in the original Bourne tradition.  Renner does a fantastic Bourne imitation.  I hope he does more in this series.
B00A2IUHM6|3.0|It was just ok, kind of funny at times, kind of dumb and very pointless.  I laughed a little, would not recommend.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This Movie will never go out of style!  A great coming of age movie that teaches perseverance! Perfect for ages 7 and up!

B0090SI582|4.0|The Wolverine retraces the steps of its title character from World War II to the present day, with ghosts of his past haunting him in the forms of a flawless (even if she is dead) Jean Grey and a Japanese soldier he saved from nuclear obliteration in Nagasaki. Standard Marvel Studios fare, really, but who can argue with a movie starring Marvel's most short-tempered human weapon?<br /><br />Hugh Jackman has got to be taking a pounding from playing Logan all these years. And though his face looks far too old to play such an ageless character, the rest of his body is in fantastic shape. Though many people may not be familiar with his co-stars, they all shine in the film which takes place in Tokyo and Nagasaki. Logan's main rivals in the film are Viper, a biochemist with a wicked kiss and an immunity and intimate knowledge of toxins, played by the gorgeous Svetlana Khodchenkova (from the European film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, 2011); and the scheming son of the Yashida empire, Shinigen, portrayed by Hiroyuki Sanada, son of the soldier he saved in Nagasaki almost a century ago. Asian model Tao Okamoto portrays Shinigen's daughter, Mariko, heir to the largest corporation in Asia, and Yukio, who has the ability to forsee a person's death, played by Rila Fukushima who has only appeared in one short film before this blockbuster.<br /><br />Given that most of the screen time is held by actors and actresses who have had very little relative experience, one might assume that The Wolverine is worth passing on. I think that the crew over at Marvel Studios learned their mistakes from X-Men Origins: Wolverine, however, and have brought together a tight, compelling story, even if its action scenes (the bullet train scene, in particular) do seem a little like Wire-Fu. When you watch it (and you will... you know you will) stay tuned after the credits for a scene introducing next year's obligatory X-Men flick, Days of Future Past, a two minute snippet that brings back Ian McKellen andPatrick Stewart in a scene that, from start to finish, made the comic geek inside me squeal with glee.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I was surprised how much I liked this. It was fairly constant laughs and a good story. Nice and light. Good movie. Good acting. Good watch.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I loved the fact that this was ordered and on its way in no time and the quality of this was excellent...I love Downton Abbey and I love Amazon for being so efficient with their products. My daughter and her husband are regular Amazon users, so I thought I would give<br />this a try.  I could not get the third season from other sources and she said to try<br />Amazon....
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|I can't believe this got such great reviews! What a terrible movie! It had such a horrible message! I get that it was saying \\"be you\\" but it did so in such a twisted way. Not to mention the delightfullness of Disney has just gone out the window. Now they just cater to the raunchy nature of today's youth. I was disgusted by this movie. Boo, Disney, you can do better!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. It is rich in history and tells a story of how the people in Bombay live. They may be poor but seem richer then we can ever be. They are genuine and real. My hats off to Gregory Roberts.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The Wizard of Oz has been my favorite movie forever. I couldn't wait for this to come out. Boy was I dissapointed. The only reason it gets three stars is because visually it was beautiful. But man, James Franco. I mean come on. He was terrible, just terrible. It seemed like he didn't even try. So dissapointed.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Enjoyed the storyline, and the language was not nearly as rough as Torino.  Definitely recommend this one, some language, but it fits the story and setting.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This was a cute little romance/zombie movie. I wasn't rivetted but it was nice to see something different. Worth a watch.
B007N85POS|5.0|I purchased Angry Birds because we were down the shore and my grandson asked me if I had it on my Kindle.  I didn't, but I purchased it for him, and HE LOVES it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome easy to play better than subway suffers or temple run. or t run 2 really good game super really fun
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I like it, but now it is too hard to continue. And since this is the first factory balls, I can't seem to find help on the internet.<br />Makes me sad and frustrated.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I have my fav's of Sade and she rocked them into an even better favorite. She is the queen of &#34;simple&#34; being over the top!!!!<br />the old saying &#34;less is more.&#34; She nailed it!
