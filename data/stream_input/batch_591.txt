B000002U82|5.0|Well, its been only 4 month since y first listened to Pink FLoyd but really listening to them, and after i heard Iron Maiden like 9 years ago, there hasnt been any band that had made such an impact on me. Im greatfull that i didnt heard Pink Floyd before, because i know that now is a time that i most value this band, and maybe before i wouldn't have been so touched like now.  <br /> <br />Well about DSOTM i think that almost everything has been said. I really liked a review which said that if you hear the song individually you wouldn't understand why this album was that great, but listening the whole of it you realize why it is so great. There is something about this album that makes it so great and i dont think there is any word that can describe that. Well, every time i listen to it i feel and find new things, and every time i just love it more. Im 22 so its strange that i didnt heard to Pink FLoyd before, but never its to late, jejeje....
0802130208|1.0|i read a confederacy of dunces at the beach over thanksgiving detirmined to finish it over a week. i figured it had to be considering it won the pulitzer prize award for fiction and will ferrell was considering starring in the still pending and possible (i hope not) movie version. i found all 416 pages of this book to be sheer pompousness and pointless. there was little plot..if any apart from the stripper darla's struggle. it was not worth the time to read. trust me. there are plenty of other good books out there. <br /> <br />
B0000256KE|5.0|First picked this up on vinyl, a couple of years after its release, having first heard Siren and Country Life. Love the inside cover art where the 5 of them are each in rock star pose yielding different guitars. Too cool! Even though there is a an eeriness to some of the songs/arrangements on For Your Pleasure, there is an overall warmth to the sound. For me, hearing this album was a life-altering experience. The scope of the instrumentation (from 1920's to the future and beyond) was mind-boggling. They were unlike any band in the world. All of the progressive rock and pop stuff I was listening to at the time paled in comparison. This more than stands the test of time!! An essential purchase!! Let's all hope and pray that their recent studio endeavors will harken back to the creativity and intensity of this (their collectively favorite release). Scary how good this is.

B0001NBNAM|4.0|These are Connie's first Italian recordings and also her highest charting. They have been released separately on CD several years ago, but it is nice to have them together to give folks an idea what an international singer Connie Francis is. She can capture the moment in any language and was especially fine in Italian. Of her 5 US Italian lps, Love Italian Style is the best. I hope it sees the light of day on CD. Some of the selections can be found on her Italian Collection 1 and 2. This particular CD boasts big production values with luscious arrangements you can almost eat up. Ah, Bella Connie. A feast for the ears and always a delight.

0375831002|5.0|As I was reading the last few pages of this novel, with tears streaming down my face, I couldn't bear to let this story go, and immediately started reading it again from the very beginning. This is a powerful story of survival as told by \\"death\\" the narrator.  I also am an avid reader, and constantly search for a truly good read.  I found it in The Book Thief, and you will too.  I wanted to contact the author, Mr. Zusak and ask him so many questions, and to thank him for writing such a beautiful story.   Thank you Mr. Zusak, I will forever have Liesel and the other characters in my heart.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|I have to be honest. I used to really dislike Rihanna. I couldn't stand \\"Pon De Replay\\" and \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want\\" and thought she was talentless.<br /><br />So how did I come to be buying and reviewing Rihanna's second album now? Well, it was all down to \\"SOS\\" and \\"Unfaithful.\\" Both of these songs are strong, and I loved them both. I decided to give her album a go because both of these songs were fantastic.<br /><br />I'm glad I did. The material on this album is high quality, and much MUCH better then \\"Pon De Replay\\" and \\"IILTYW.\\" I bought it on Friday and have already listened to it numerous times.<br /><br />What are the standout tracks on this album? Well, for a start, my absolute favourite track is \\"Final Goodbye.\\" It is so fab, the music is gorgeous (full of guitars) and the lyrics are just amazing. Rihanna sings this song so well, and it's made me teary at times. Definitely the standout of the album.<br /><br />Other strong songs include the two singles - \\"SOS\\" and \\"Unfaithful.\\" Completely different in their respects - \\"SOS is a dancehall reggae pop song, with a strong chorus and very catchy lyrics, and \\"Unfaithful\\" is another beautiful ballad, with fantastic lyrics and brilliant piano. They are both equally great. \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" should be a contender for the single after \\"Unfaithful\\" - it shows a different side to Rihanna, more rocky then other songs on the album. The chorus is really catchy and it has great lyrics. \\"PS (I'm Still Not Over You)\\" and \\"A Million Miles Away\\" are two more fab ballads, and the fast tracks \\"Dem Haters,\\" \\"We Ride,\\" \\"Break It Off\\" and \\"A Girl Like Me\\" are all brilliant. A surprise was the \\"part 2\\" of \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want\\" - like I mentioned I didn't like the original, so I wasn't expecting to like this one, but I do. The music is BRILL, and the song is much, much better.<br /><br />Overall, this is a strong album, that's converted me into a Rihanna fan. She is definitely one of my favourite singers now.
B000006TRV|5.0|This album not only signifies a change in Pink Floyds musical approach, but a change within the group itself. This was to be the last Floyd album in which the group would participate together as a whole. Tensions grew to an unbearable point with the members of Floyd, and the end of the \\"The Wall\\" Tour indicated the end of Pink Floyd as it was known. (Many things happened within the group between the album and tour(ie. Wright), but you can find the nitty gritty details elsewhere on the web. And don't get me started with \\"The Final Cut\\".  <br /> <br /> <br />\\"The Wall\\" evokes so many feelings that it is understandable why it is one of the most successful albums to ever be released. Songs like Mother, Goodbye Cruel World, Hey You, Comfortably Numb, etc., are so dark and dripping with emotion that you can't help but to be captivated.  <br />Granted, like many have pointed out, there is filler. Even so, I have come to like every bit of the album.  <br /> <br />I encourage anyone who has not heard \\"The Wall\\" straight through to give it a try. And to those who have never listened to \\"The Wall\\" to get yourself a copy of this brilliant piece of work. <br />
0307277674|5.0|It's after hours in the Louvre, and those of us who work in library-museum-archives environments know just how creepy such public places can become late at night. But if you do work there - for long enough so it becomes familiar ground, another home in a real sense - it can also feel like your own living room. That's how the Louvre feels to curator Jacques Sauniere, even after he's mortally wounded by an after hours visitor. He knows just what he needs to do, in his last few minutes of life; and he knows exactly how to do it, even while the Louvre's activated security system holds him trapped within the gallery where the Mona Lisa and other Da Vinci paintings hang.<br /><br />What Sauniere must do is leave a message, or messages, for his estranged granddaughter. As a police cryptographer, Sophie Neveu will have access to the crime scene. Jacques Sauniere must find a way of passing on to Sophie all the secrets that he dies to protect, without revealing those secrets to anyone else. Anyone else, that is, except the man Sauniere makes sure the police will also summon to the gallery where his body lies: American symbologist Robert Langdon, who soon finds himself cast in the role of chief suspect as Sauniere's killer.<br /><br />All the things that writing teachers tell their pupils not to do, author Brown does in this book. He writes in chapters so short that if they were sentences in an essay, he'd be losing points for choppiness. He flashes back repeatedly to his characters' past lives. He uses more different character viewpoints in one book than some novelists use in an entire lifetime's literary output. He supplies background information, history as his plot requires it to be presented, in multi-paragraph chunks. He writes richly detailed setting descriptions, that according to conventional writing advice ought to have his readers putting the book aside in boredom. But - amazingly, and wonderfully - for this author, in this book, those techniques work. Do they ever work! Because Brown paces the novel masterfully, even the driest (if presented in another framework) passages slip by without interrupting the story's flow. The mystery deepens from chapter to chapter, with resolution coming in unexpected yet reasonably logical ways. Even the villians (who aren't always who you think they will be, by the way...) command the reader's empathy.<br /><br />I found some of the resolutions awkward, and perhaps a bit rushed after all the build-up preceding them. I came away from the book a bit concerned about readers who may take all that its author presents as fact, for plotting purposes, as just that: historically certain truth. But approached as a work of speculative fiction, which is the only way I could approach it, this is one cracking fine read! I don't wonder at its sales record, which I'm sure its controversial subject matter has greatly increased.ver work!

B000020617|5.0|The number of cd's that an individual owns is not an indicator of that person's musical expertise-it just means that the person likes to shop for music. Everyone has different musical tastes and will view music differently.

B000BNX3B4|3.0|MUST LOVE DOGS is very reminiscent of an extended sitcom, which would have played better with Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow.  Diane Lane and John Cusack are too talented to resort to this lightweight romantic \\"comedy\\"--which has few laughs.  To think that Lane or Cusack would have any trouble finding romantic partners is absurd---to think they'd resort to the internet for pairing is even moreso.  Ah, but such is the stuff of modern day romances.  Where's Doris Day and Rock Hudson when you need them?  Lane and Cusack are admirably adept in their poorly developed roles.  Christopher Plummer takes a change of pace in playing Lane's widowed father; Stockard Channing stands tough as Plummer's new girlfriend; Elizabeth Perkins plays the matchmaking sister with her usual gusto; and Dermot Mulroney once again plays a selfish cad.  It's all rather mundane, and mildly entertaining at best.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|This movie turned me off with its focus on Nash's schizophrenia rather than his monumental achievements. Three-fourths of the movie turns out to be Nash's delusion. I felt like a voyeur, entertained by someone else's pain.  At the end, I wasn't even certain of exactly what it was that Nash had developed....just that he was a brilliant mathematician and severely ill. The barbaric \\"medical treatment\\" of the 1950s left me feeling sick.<br /><br />A documentary would have been far more entertaining. Nash is a brilliant man despite, not because of, his illness, and I found this movie (especially since much of it is fictionalized) to be exploitive. Only two stars.
B000002UB6|5.0|OK, so Paul McCartney was angry at Phil Spector for allegedly ruining this album -- but don't believe it. He had a point about using his music without his permission, but he didn't have a point about the final product. This album is beautiful, provactive and fun: all in all, what one expects of the Beatles.  <br /> <br />But then, it isn't a typical Beatles album. It was made under the worst of conditions by a band which had become less a partnership and more a reluctant collaboration between four very different artists. But, unlike the White Album, this disc still manages to be consistent and balanced. Each member's contribution compliments the next, and Spector's production (albeit overdone on \\"Long and Winding Road) ties it all together. Don't let McCartney give this album a bad name.
0312995423|3.0|Now that I have read all of Dan Brown's books, I can firmly say that Digital Fortress is his weakest. Brown tends to write his books in a similar fashion. He adds the same inevitable twists and turns in advancing the plot. Readers can now understand that when one of Brown's characters gets close to finding the answer, something else happens that just prolongs the book. Digital Fortress is no exception. Contrary to how Brown writes his, however, he does provide an intriguing plot that can leave you wondering what goes on at the National Security Agency. <br /> <br />If you are a huge fan of Dan Brown's novels, then I would recommend Digital Fortress. It is not a book filled with symbolism like Angel and Demons or The Da Vinci Code. However, it is another well thought out plot that raises some questions about the legality of government agencies. The phrase that stands out the most is somewhere along the lines of, \\"The government watches out for the people but who watches out for the government.\\" This book will lead you on an almost never ending rollercoaster from deadly shootouts to an unbreakable code. Our two main characters, David Becker and Susan Fletcher, whose marriage was put on hold by the NSA, are sent on two different journeys not knowing what they are doing or who they are doing it for.  <br /> <br />If you are not a fan of Dan Brown, then Digital Fortress will be a disappointment. I found myself wanting to just finish the book to see what happens. Brown could have cut the novel in half and still gotten to the same ending. There is no deeper meaning or plot that pulls readers in as some of his other books do. Everyone is betrayed and some have disgusting secrets. There is no solid character that you can rely on throughout the book. <br /> <br />Those interested in standing up against NSA, especially after recent events would find this book interesting. However, do not begin to think that what this book says is true or that the NSA has been corrupted. Just like any other Dan Brown book, Digital Fortress is fiction. <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|rhcp new double album \\"stadium arcadium\\" is an amazing album. both discs explore old and new sounds of the band and the songs are pretty great. from pure funk to hard rock all the songs are classic. flea's bass has not sound better and john frusciante's guitar is even stronger. anthony kiedis get to experiment with his voice and i didnt know he could have done that from the other albums. though some songs are epically long, the music makes up for it and so do the lyrics. have no personal favorites just listen to both discs (jupitar and mars) back to back. highly recommended.
B00005JOVN|4.0|I really enjoyed Poseidon. So much so, that during a particularly thrilling sequence in the middle of the movie, in which all the characters are racing up a very tight air conditioner vent to avoid the rising water, that I almost vomitted. Perhaps it had to do with the massive amount of popcorn I inhaled during the previews. Nonetheless, the movie was extremely thrilling and I had such a blast, a bigger blast than watching The Da Vinci Code (which was less thriller and more mystery). I love to begin the summer movie season with an excellent thriller!! <br /> <br />Poseidon boasts an all-star cast, including Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, and the heartthrob Josh Lucas, incredible special effects, and decent performances all around. Here's the story, in short, a giant wave crashes into a luxury oceanliner, killing everyone on board, except a precious few who defy captain's orders and manage to wriggle and run their way through the destroyed, and upside down floating, oceanliner. Each character is key in some way, performing a \\"thank God we have this person on board\\" action at some point during the movie.  <br /> <br />When the captain spies that giant wave coming at the cruiseliner, you'll instantly grab your seat in shock and awe. Because it's a giant wave. And it's much more impressive this time around than in the original. In comparison to the new version, the original is, well, dull and slow, with crappy special effects, and sappy perfomances. This Poseidon is a much better effort, and you won't be sorry that you went to see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
0064409422|5.0|How does one review this book? Everyone knows about it, everyone has an opinion on it and not everybody likes it. Any discussion on the matter seems somewhat redundant. Deemed controversial because of its religious connotations, adored by millions of readers young and old, the subject of hundreds of different interpretations and now the focus of a blockbuster movie (with sequels still to come), it doesn't seem the \\"Lion, Witch and Wardrobe\\" debate will end any time soon.<br /><br />The four Pevensie siblings are evacuated to the country estate of Professor Kirke during World War II: responsible Peter, worrisome Susan, sullen Edmund and imaginative Lucy. During a game of hide-and-seek Lucy creeps into an old apple-wood wardrobe, pushing aside heavy fur coats, and \\"a moment later she was standing in the middle of a wood at night time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air.\\" Befriending a faun named Mr Tumnus, Lucy learns of her new situation: she's in the land of Narnia, which has been ruled over for a hundred years by an evil White Witch who has made it eternal winter, but never Christmas. But Lucy's coming may portend a change in Narnia; it has long been prophesied that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve (that is, humans) sit on the thrones of Cair Paravel it will herald an end to winter and the coming of the great \\"Aslan\\".<br /><br />But first Lucy has to convince her siblings of the reality of Narnia, especially tricky considering the attitude of Edmund who is determined to ridicule his younger sister. His mind is instantly changed when he follows Lucy into the wardrobe for a second time - but meets up with the White Witch herself. Entranced by the taste of her magical Turkish Delight, Edmund is soon convinced that his best course of action is to lure all his siblings into her power so that he might be made her son and heir.<br /><br />Once Peter and Susan discover the secret of the wardrobe, the story really starts to roll. Discovering that Mr Tumnus has been captured by agents of the White Witch, the siblings make the acquaintance of two talking beavers shortly before Edmund sneaks out in order to defect to the Witch's side. Desperate to get their brother back (as nasty as he is), Peter, Susan and Lucy agree to accompany the beavers to where Aslan is said to have set up an army to combat the Witch...<br /><br />There is a lot of debate over the correct reading order of these books, whether they should be read in chronological or publishing order (in which \\"The Lion\\" comes either first or second). Technically, I don't think it really matters (heck, I read \\"The Silver Chair\\" first), but if you want to make the effort then I recommend that \\"The Lion\\" is read first, considering the nature and identity of Aslan is kept mysterious throughout the first half of the book in order to build suspense for those new to Narnia. What may not be known to the new reader (if there are any left that is), is that \\"The Lion\\" is surprisingly short. The story speeds by at a cracking pace, and so is accessible to a young audience, especially since Lewis himself is a heavy presence within the narrative, often addressing the reader directly to explain, elaborate or shift the scene.<br /><br />As of late, the Chronicles of Narnia have been under some critical scrutiny, accused of sexism, racism and heavy religious propaganda. Yikes! That's heavy stuff for a children's book! Fellow British fantasy-writer Philip Pullman in particular has made stinging attacks on the Narnia books, but how bad are they really? Well, there's sure to be some frustration over the fact Susan and Lucy receive weapons as gifts before being instructed not to use them in battle since \\"battles are ugly when women fight\\"; never mind the fact that Peter and Edmund (both children) are perfectly able to hack their way through enemy ranks.<br /><br />But that's not even opening the discussion of the religious content. Just how Christian is Narnia?In my opinion; as Christian as you want it to be. For me personally, it was several years before I realised the religious connotations at work within the novel and the book can certainly be enjoyed by readers who have no spiritual convictions whatsoever. That being said, it is undeniable that Lewis drew on his own belief system to establish certain story-points, most clearly seen in the sacrifice and resurrection scene that is the centrepiece of the novel. Yet one shouldn't consider \\"Narnia\\" as in any way allegorical; Lewis himself preferred to call it \\"suppositional\\". Aslan doesn't represent Christ; he *is* Christ as he might exist in another world where he is called upon to take a similar (but not identical) course of action as he was in *this* world. Other elements; such as Mr Tumnus or the Turkish Delight have no allegorical purpose at all - they serve the story and cater to Lewis's imagination - it's as simple as that.<br /><br />Read into the content any way you want, since the way in which the story is told is beautifully done. Lewis was the master of unforgettable imagery; whether it be the contrasting colours of red lips, white skin and black hair of the witch, four children crowned as monarchs, a faun scurrying through the woods with an umbrella and scarf, and what is perhaps the most widely recognised scene in children's literature: a lamp-post glowing softly in the darkness of a snow-covered wood. Drawing on a range of mythological creatures (from Roman nymphs and fauns, Norwegian dwarfs, talking animals and even a cameo from Father Christmas), the land of Narnia doesn't come anywhere near the detail and workmanship of Tolkien's Middle-Earth, and yet as a charm and beauty all of its own. Lewis's vivid detail and wonderful invention of a land and its inhabitants are followed through in the sequels, and in my humble opinion it is one of the most beautifully-realised subworlds ever created.<br /><br />Just read it.tian is Narnia?

B000BW7QWW|4.0|I saw a few episodes of `Firefly' but never got hooked and probably only saw two episodes from start to finish. I was impressed with various aspects of the show but the heavy western theme just did not interest me. Thankfully in `Serenity' the aspects of `Firefly' I did not like are minimized and it improves on the aspects I did like. The result is simply a great film. If you enjoy sci-fi at all and movies such as `Star Wars' and `Star Trek' you will almost certainly like `Serenity'. In fact Serenity is certainly superior to a number of the movies in both of those venerable series. <br /> <br />The special effects are inconsistent but always acceptable and sometimes outstanding. The sound is outstanding. The movie has great comical moments as well as creepy ones. The cast does an outstanding job and the cinematography is interesting to say the least. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the movie so much I am going to buy the `Firefly' DVD set. If you did not like `Firefly' give `Serenity' a shot; I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. If you were a fan of the show this is simply a must get movie. <br /> <br />Hopefully the surprise success of `Serenity' will allow them to do a sequel.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|Amazing how the print was found of the original version of the film after 1) the jazzed up one was released on DVD not too long ago and 2) now that there are newer technologies being released such as HD-DVD/Blu-ray that provide even better picture resolution. <br /> <br />I'll buy it since my unaltered version is on LaserDisc but I'm not happy to be shelling out more money for something that should have been released in the boxed set previously.

B0009S4IHY|3.0|\\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" is the most beautifully crafted of my three favorite Stephen Chow's films -  \\"Shaolin Soccer,\\" King of Comedy\\" and this one.  Comedy, martial arts and traditional Chinese fairy tale are all rolled up together in Chow's hilarious, inventive and masterfully told tale, \\"Kung Fu Hustle.\\" If you're not familiar with Stephen Chow's enormous talent, you're in for a big treat.     Chow's leads, always played by himself, most resemble Charlie Chapman's characters.  His physical comedy is especially reminiscent of Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chase - characters that are inept yet endearing and enduring.  Chow's hero is a loser who always falls in love with a poor girl, innocent and trusting. Both of them apparently destined to remain at the bottom rung of society's ladder.  But the similarity to Charlie Chaplin ends there.  Ultimately, this comedy is about the resurrection of one's higher nature.    While he's a child, Chow's character is conned into buying a pamphlet that supposedly holds the secret to great spiritual power.  Shortly afterwards, a humiliating incident causes him to lose faith in that power, and mistrust his better impulses.   Consequently, as an adult, all he wants is to be a really bad guy -in the worst way, literally.  Most of the film's humor comes from his ridiculous and self defeating attempts to prove just how bad he is.  Like a misguided Don Quixote, his quest is to align himself with evil. At his side is his bumbling, confused and even more ineffectual, but ever loyal, companion.     Our hero chooses Pig Sty Alley, a rundown housing complex, for his first attempt to prove how bad he is.  Thinking he's picked an even bigger bunch of losers than he himself, he tangles with the strange assortment of seemingly ordinary characters who inhabit this Chinese tenement. However, they aren't in the least intimidated by his criminal pose, and they prove to be a lot tougher than he anticipates.  They're much more concerned about what's going on in the neighborhood than about any potential danger he might bring.   Desperate to be taken seriously, he accidentally gets himself involved in his first dicey situation.    His determination to hook up with evil takes him, and the people of the neighborhood, into ever more challenging,  frightening, and serious confrontations with really bad guys, which brings out surprising strengths in the people of Pig Sty Alley.  When finally faced with evil personified, the hero's true spirit emerges.     This movie is wonderful entertainment for all ages.  But for anyone who wants to be a filmmaker, it's a lesson that shouldn't be missed.  Stephen Chow is one of the best filmmakers of today. He writes, directs and acts in all his movies.  He pays equal attention to every aspect of filmmaking - whether special effects, editing, set and costume design, sound effects, music, character, or story development.  Every character is unique and distinct.  He works against the expected. In one very funny chase scene, he uses classical music instead of typically comic music.  Listen for the pinball sound effects during a free-for-all fight scene. I've seen this movie many times and I never cease to marvel at his ingenuity, complexity and originality.    As a bonus, his story is powerfully optimistic. It shows us that fighting courageously for the good, and to be truly yourself, can elevate you to heights you never dreamed of (really!)  That the least among us may carry hidden greatness.  That together we can win against enormous odds.  That once we understand who we really are, and what we are here to give, love will be ours.  And, last but not least, that we can laugh at ourselves along the way.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Ambiance, Guitar, Metal and Maynard.  I listen to the album as I write this review.  I have listened to TooL from the start and am one of the people who craves the music, I have read many a review where people are complaining about the lenght of songs, in todays world of rock where the average song lasts what.... there minuets,  TooL brings it back to a point where each song is a story.  It takes time to weave each story into the perfection that is an album.  The entire album listened too fully and with out judgment tells a story, as did Aenema, in my opinion to be the best TooL album to date, being from start to finish an entire story exampling the bands progression throughout the ablub.  Lataralis did so as well, and I know the sales weren't as strong as they were with Aenema, but I think as TooL progresses as a band and the attention spans of normal people lessens, TooL's fan base will continue to decrease, but as long as me and fans like me hunger for a more rich experience with there music, an experience not just a song, TooL will be there.  I hail this new album and listen to it nearly every day just to get back to a time where an album said something, and the fans wanted to hear it, not just hear one song they like and then the rest of the album sucks because the band in question just wrote for the \\"hit\\".
B00005NNMK|5.0|The Final Countdown is one hell of an album. These guys are from Sweden. John Norum (guitar) and Joey Tempest (vocals) met in life, and discovered that they both enjoyed Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple, etc. So, why not put a band together? Well, they did. <br /> <br />Well, indeed, they chose another name, before Europe. They were called Force. They won a contest, that went to a record deal internationally. However, they got a deal with Epic Records in the states. They released 2 albums internationally first. They released \\"The Final Countdown\\" in 1986. I wasn't alive back then, but it's one hell of an album... I will explain why, with a synopsis of each song.. (I think I spelled that wrong). <br /> <br />The Final Countdown 10/10- I never get bored of this song, due to the guitar sound, and Joey Tempest's vocals. They are strong, that make you go wow. It's also probably their most popular song. <br /> <br />Rock The Night 10/10- This one is quite a rocker. I wouldn't be surprised if many bands of today covered this song, since it deserves to be covered. You'll understand why. <br /> <br />Carrie 9/10- I don't listen to Carrie frequently, but it is a good ballad indeed. <br /> <br />Danger On The Track 10/10- I like this song, due to the dynamics, and just the feeling of the song. <br /> <br />Ninja 10/10- This is a very upbeat, and ass kicking song, due to the guitars, and speed, and all of those other dynamics. You'll love it too. <br /> <br />Cherokee 10/10- Great history song. They are talking about the trail of tears, which also involved the 7th president of the United States, Andrew Jackson. It's a great song! <br /> <br />Time Has Come 9/10- Slower song, but it's great. <br /> <br />Heart of Stone 10/10- This song reminds me of some other song.. but I can't think of it. It's very catchy, and well made. <br /> <br />On The Loose 10/10- Great jammin' song! <br /> <br />Love Chaser 9/10- Slower, but still a great song! <br /> <br />This album also has extra 3 lives tracks. So we finally get to hear them live. I enjoy the extra tracks. Well, just get the album. They apparently know Yngwie J Malmsteen really well, the shredder legend. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000089CJI|5.0|Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello craft poptronica to perfection with \\"Give Up\\". I was a little bit skeptical about this album, because I thought nothing they put out could be as good as their song Such Great Heights. I was wrong, very wrong. <br /> <br />It's almost impossible to compare the Postal Service's music with another band's. There are many poptronica bands out there, but almost none of them can pull out the same quality of music that the Postal Service does (bands like Freezepop-- ugh.) <br /> <br />It took a couple of listens to appreciate some songs (like Recycled Air and This Place is a Prison), but once you open up to new ideas and sounds, \\"Give Up\\" could become your new favorite album.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|A shamelessly mushy and romantic holiday comedy clearly defines Love Actually, but that's exactly what it wants to be.  As such, it completely succeeds.  A charming balance of couples and storylines combined with holiday finery and lovely performances make this a real winner.  You would really have to be a total grinch to not be moved by this movie.  From the opening wedding to the sweet conclusion, this is one great Valentine to love and romance.  The cast is great: Thompson, Firth, Grant, Linney, Nisssam are all wonderful.  It will make you fall in love all over again, pine for the love that you lost, or completely depress you.  A bulls eye!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I have never seen the play verison of this but I loved it. This movie made me laugh at times and cry at times and I felt like these eight people were apart of me.<br /><br />The opening scene was nicely done as was the Maureen Tango which had to be my favorite scene along with the scene when they are at the restuarant.<br /><br />I really loved all the actors espically Jermaine Herdia as Angel. He does a great job at portraying a crossdresser. Rosario Dawson also does a wonderful job during Mimi's withdrawal scene.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a movie that will make you feel like you're apart of it Rent is that movie.<br /><br />Penny Lane
B000F6IOC0|5.0|I loved this better then the first one. There was a lot more action in this one and the actors played their roles well.
0321213351|4.0|The book discusses how you can refactor your existing code using design patterns. Unlike many other pattern books it doesn't limit itself to the famous GoF patterns, also includes other less known ones. <br />It has a clear structure, which is followed for all patterns: 1) shows the original design, 2) shows the target design, 3) gives background on the pattern discussed with pros and cons, 4) step-by-step takes you through the refactoring process. <br />I find it very informative and use it as reference frequently. <br />The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the examples are sometimes complex ones, which are hard to follow in the way they are presented. Prefer to read more self-contained sort of books where you can understand the topic without additional supporting material (like code downloads). It would be better if the book showed the complete refactored code at the end of each pattern, to give the full picture. <br />I recommend it for experienced programmers, who are already familiar with patterns because the book's main focus is rather the refactoring process than the introduction to the basics of patterns.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is a movie that haunts you long after it is done.  It resonates far stronger than most films and speaks to universal truths and emotions not just that of a few people.  For anyone who has ever had to compromise who they are or made choices based on situations or society rather than what they had in their heart. <br /> <br />It is funny that as the film progresses, the \\"normal\\" lives the characters pretend to lead begin to ring more and more hollow until they seem to be the oddity.   <br /> <br />Remarkable performances and wonderful restraint by everyone involved makes this a film that will last far longer than some.  There is real humanness to everyone in the story both men and women.  Nothing is crystal clear and the boundaries keep moving.   <br /> <br />Worthy of a best picture award and more likely, in my mind, to be the film that stands the test of time.
0767818040|1.0|i can't even begin to tell how bad this movie is. it just rolls around in its own excess and asked us to play stupid and just follow along. i sold this one the day after i bought it.
630514415X|1.0|Do not waste your money purchasing this movie. Wait until it shows on TV, if you're unlucky enough to see it. The music for the story was inappropriate and totally threw off the entire story. Instead of following the story my husband and I kept concentrating on the terrible music. Dont waste your money.
1592402038|5.0|I LOVED this book.  Couldn't put it down.    Clearly, this isn't a book for everyone.  However, her umbrage at the utter lack of respect for rules of punctuation is one that I share.    For instance, I once nearly fainted when I walked into a diner and saw a chalkboard that said:    Try our \\"soup\\"    \\"soup?\\"  Is it soup, or isn't it?  Why is it \\"soup?\\"    Also, my use of the Oxford comma is one that used to get me in trouble with one particularly ignorant former boss who thought it was incorrect.    I'm relatively sure that this book would not appeal to everyone, but I found it utterly hilarious.      It was also very informative.      A very funny read for people who love the English language.    (I really, really hope I haven't broken any rules of punctuation in this review.)
B000EMGAOY|4.0|This will be another of the 50 dozen reviews to be buried in the avelanche of opinions surrounding this album and the band. Whether you hate it or love it, the amount of responses suggests the significance of The Red Hot Chili Peppers and that people actually care enough to put down their 2cents. <br /> <br />For me, 'Stadium Arcadium'  is the band's most satisfying release since 'Blood Sugar..'  <br /> <br />Realistically, expecting another dose of Chili's of the late 80's early 90's is dillusional as the band aren't in their 20's anymore fueled with lust, attitude, arrogance and that kind of youthful energy you only get once in your life. I do miss that band I admit, but few band ever stay the same and nor should they.  <br /> <br />'Stadium Arcadium' contains some of the best songwritting the Chili's have ever created which is a big call. By that meaning the songs are catchy, melodic, well arranged, easy to the ear but mostly it is Anthony's vocal delivery backed with John's sweet backing vocals which makes this album such a great sing along. The songs are well crafted, the production is absolutely flawless, Flea's bass is well and truely in the mix and John Fruschante, for the first time in more than a decade, shreds a little in that 70's wah solo type of way. Actually,in essence 'Stadium Arcadium' reaks of John Fruschante and it's the type of smell that makes me feel pretty damn good inside. <br /> <br />No, this album probably won't make some people jump out of their skin like the Chili's of past but the different type of experience this album gives me is extremely positive and enjoyable.  <br /> <br />'Californication' was more misses than hits, 'By The Way' took a turn that left me confused and pissed off, yet 'Stadium Arcadium' somehow manages to fuse the vibe of these two albums, improve it to no end and incorparates no cliche shadows of their former selves. Their really isn't any weak tracks out of the 28, obviously some better than others, and I am hardpressed to choose a favourite out of the two disks. To me that is an ingenious achievement in itself. <br /> <br />I could moan for hours about why I loved Chili's of old, how awesome 'Blood Sugar...\\" is (one of the greatest albums of all time IMPO) but I'd be the only only one suffering in the end. Fortunately 'Stadium Arcadium' delivers something special, enjoyable and full of life. <br /> <br />It looks like I'll have to save the moaning for the next one....
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie has to have one of the best love story ever. It wasn't to much talking but you seen the love growing between the two charaters. They had so much passion for each other that they couldn't express out in the open. These two men went on for years with out seeing and being without each other but as soon as they see each other again all the feelings they once had for each other all came back and started to take control of there lives. This love story stands out for more than the fact that it was between two men, it stands out because it was true. True love.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|The songs in this excellent compilation range in obscurity from hits as well known as \\"Louie Louie\\" by The Kingsmen to lost classics such as \\"Spazz\\" by The Elastik Band. Just imagine how much it would cost to pay collectors prices for all the 45s represented here, thank God for Rhino! I loved every earsplitting second of the roughly 5 hours of raw energy in this collection!
0790729725|5.0|Not that there's anything wrong with The Godfather.  Although its director and cowriter, Francis Ford Coppola, has expressed his dismay with audience reactions to the movie.  Particularly, audience admiration for Michael Corleone (Coppola went to a number of screenings where people actually applauded when the door was slammed shut on Michael's wife, Kay, toward the end of the movie).<br /><br />But I'm not knocking The Godfather. Coppola did not in any way, shape, or form intend to glorify organized crime. It appears that Coppola's primary intention was to criticize corporate America by showing its similarities with organized crime. For example, the movie demonstrated how organized crime's business operations were quite similiar to those of the \\"legitimate\\" operations of corporate America.<br /><br />At any rate, Goodfellas demonstrated how ugly organized crime could get.  These \\"goodfellas\\" murdered just about everyone outside their organization that they could get their hands on, and when that wasn't enough, they turned on one another. And selling drugs wasn't enough for them; they got themselves addicted to the stuff as well.<br /><br />By the end of Goodfellas, no one walked away better off then they were at the beginning (and a good many of them didn't walk away at all).  Compared to The Godfather, Goodfellas was completely unambiguous in showing that organized crime is highly unrewarding in any number of ways.<br /><br />Scorsese's last masterpiece to date.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|This show is like a 22-hour roller coaster ride. Do not watch if you can't hold your breath for an hour at a time. Seriously good television. You will laugh, cry, scream, be angry, feel every emotion imaginable, and become totally dedicated to these flawed, wonderful people. Far and away the best the television has to offer right now. I can hardly believe Rob Thomas et. al could top Season 1, but he did. Season 3 has a pretty tall order if it will be even close to this good, but the creative geniuses and cast behind Veronica Mars have definitely earned this viewer's trust.
0684824906|5.0|A masterful study of Abraham Lincoln's cabinet. Doris helps us understand the \\"dynamic\\" at work within the Lincoln Administration in this book. Anyone studying the Civil War must read this book. Once you have you will understand why Lincoln was the right man in the White House at that time. Lincoln was a \\"deep thinker\\" and Doris makes a great point when she shows how he uses his greatest gift \\"timing\\" in all his decisions. We all know that Lincoln failed many times but eventually he learned to act at the right moment. Doris drives this point home in her book.
B0000069NC|4.0|I was really looking forward to this album and music wise I was not disappointed . <br /> <br />What I wanted to make clear is the eccentric way it sounds - this may not be important to all listeners , but it is to me as a person who sometimes listens on headphones . <br /> <br />The rhythm section instruments move all over the stereo image from song to song and this takes me out of the experience of listening , immersing myself in it and enjoying it to the fullest . <br /> <br />It is very good - I thought it was worth mentioning and it may be something that cannot be remixed or altered .
B0002KPIQY|4.0|Before actress Angelina Jolie, there was supermodel Gia Carangi. And before Jolie nailed a supporting Oscar for \\"Girl Interrupted,\\" she snared a Golden Globe for an utterly transfixing performance as the model Gia in this 1998 bio-pic. Directed by Michel Cristofer, \\"Gia\\" culls from corroborating resource material (\\"A Thing of Beauty: The Tragedy of Supermodel Gia\\" by Stephen Fred, perhaps the definitive biographical work) to capture the Phialdephia-born Gia's skyrocket to fame - she went to Vogue covers just two years after graduating from high school - and as rapid a descent, the victim of a self-destructive psyche ravaged by an insecure childhood and ill preparation for stunning beauty and uninvited fame, wealth and power. Gia died in 1986 from complications of AIDS (from IV heroin use), and her self-fueled destruction might be called just another tale of beauty and fame gone tragic. But Jolie's craftsmanship salvages the film from that fate with a stunningly honest and ethical performance. So natural is Jolie in the role of Gia that it might be offensive to dismiss her acting prowess as \\"coming naturally.\\" More to the point, Jolie's talent here is honest, and it is that honesty which makes Jolie unblinkingly compelling here. \\"Gia\\" manages to rise above other bio-pics of its type as a cautionary tale, and the caution may be that, for anyone privileged by sudden wealth, fame or anything else, there is a responsibility to that privilege. Failure to be humbled by that responsibility may bear a cost too high to survive.
0812550757|5.0|So far my experiences with Orson Scott Card have been very good. I enjoyed Ender's Game, although not without some reservations. It was good, very engaging, etc, but not particularly deep - until the end, when he turned the whole thing on its head. I thought Ender's Shadow was written with obvious skill and craft - showing maturity. Speaker for the Dead trumps them both.     I've read that Card really only wrote Ender's Game as a prelude to this novel. That makes perfect sense to me. This is a much more philosophical novel than its predecessor. It's more humanistic, intellectually complex, slower on action and thick with ideas. I loved it for that. At the beginning I was frustrated with some of the characters' actions. On one hand they're supposed to be brilliant, but on the other they make some fatally flawed decisions. But keep reading. Everything comes around and builds as the novel progresses.    By comparison, Ender's Game is kid's stuff. This is a grown-up novel, intelligent sci-fi. I know a lot of readers won't agree with that, but I find that a lot of readers like stories that provide certain easy mythologies. Ender was fighting against what he perceived to be a reasonless evil in Ender's Game. Every human can be on his side. We can all fear the Buggers and revel in his victory. Of course, Card ends that novel by undermining that victory, but most readers - I think - are willing to ignore the philosophical stuff because they're just glad Ender and humanity are safe.    This novel, however, challenges us and our perceptions from page one. I love that in a book. I see that Xenocide got even more mixed reviews than Speaker for the Dead did. That makes me want to read it all the more, though.
B000005JA8|5.0|This album is as disturbing to it's unsuspecting audience in 1969-70 as Ornette Coleman's Free Jazz was in 1960-61. <br /> <br />An out and out untrammelled expression of freedom - it is difficult to explain to rock fans used to more orderly, melodic structures. Yet the superbly produced album (by none other than Frank Zappa!)reminds us of a staggering, regrettably unsung talent of the 60s rock explosion.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard the CD Fallen on my goth friend's MP3 player, and I was utterly blown away by the richness of it! Amy Lee has a beautiful, haunting voice, she could've easily made it big singing regular pop psychobabble, but instead she chose to give her angleic voice to harsh guitars and messages of death, hate and sorrow. Whenever I hear the song \\"Hello\\", I fall into a melancholy reverie, and I can strongly relate to \\"Imaginary\\". The only, ONLY thing I hgave against this CD is that it's all sad and apocalyptic, which I love and is not at all a bad thing, but it does get old after a while. But generally, I LOVE this CD, I've been waiting for a group to use a church choir for blasphemious purposes, and Evanescence has hit the nail on the head!
B00009W0U4|5.0|This was a very intense movie that told a very sad story, one of the most wellcrafted this our postmodern era has to offer. Listen up conservatives, feminists, chauvinists and dummies, this movie is something diffrent than all the commercial crap your seeing. While Britney Spears and the god of israel (i.e. the burning \\"bush\\") are raping society there are many naive anti-intellectuals (i.e. hillbillies) who degrade this movie. Utter foolishness! This movie is art (remember that word, no, Christina Aguilera doesn't fall in that section) and it takes an artist to recognize art. Now I'm just waiting for another good movie by Michael Moore about the rape of America.
1557424292|4.0|After a few months of cajoling, my parents finally convinced me to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde. Actually, part of what motivated me was not my parents' persistant pestering (and occasionally threatening), but the fact that Oscar Wilde is the favorite author of the lead singer from my favorite out-of-date band, The Smiths (Morrissey, yes).<br /><br />  But anyway, to the book. When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself. It has the operatic and tragic occurence of an opera, or at least a play, but had The Picture of Dorain Gray been written as a play, it would have shirked the story of the wonderous use of the English language that so holds this novel up.<br /><br />  Admittedly, it was a bit thick to wade through at times, but other than that, it's a ripping good ride, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the evils and attraction of physical beauty.
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|Let's face it:  we're all voyeurs.  Every one of us.  Some of us are voyeurs more than others, but even the most \\"pure\\" amongst us are fascinated by the idea of eavesdropping into other people's business.<br /><br />This movie asks an uncomfortable question:  IF you could get away with it, would you do it?  Would you listen in as people divulged their deepest secrets?  Would you watch people / couples during their private moments?  Would you get off to it?  Would you try to play God and use what you new to make the world a \\"better\\" place?<br /><br />In some ways, this movie reminded me of BODY DOUBLE with Melanie Griffith.  While that was a totally different plot, it too went into the topic of voyeurism and all its temptations.<br /><br />This is, in short, the premise of this movie.  Of course, the best reason to watch it is that it stars Sharon Stone.  She sizzles in the movie, and this is probably her steamiest role outside the original BASIC INSTINCT.<br /><br />Intrigued?  If so, by all means pick up this film.  It may just reveal a part of you that you didn't know (or didn't want to know) existed.
B00082IJ08|1.0|Feel Good Inc. is the only good song on the entire album...every other song is weird and boring. I couldn't listen to more than 30 seconds of all the other songs without wanting to go to the next one. In fact, I just bought the CD yesterday and I listed it this morning on eBay...I want at least part of the $10 I paid back!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|OK, I will admit it:  I just don't \\"get it.\\"  This movie obviously has a wide appeal.  Two of my co-workers raved about how funny it was, which prompted me to buy it.  I laughed a total of one time (not the best return on my investment for a comedy).<br /><br />The humor in the movie is very dry - and that's an understatement.  Napoleon is the \\"class geek\\" that all of us remember from high school.  So far so good, but the film simply didn't do anything for me.  In a word, I found it lame.<br /><br />I literally nearly fell asleep during this movie - it was that dull for me.  By about 1/4 way through it I could not wait for it to end.  I stuck it out as I kept expecting it to get better and become funny.  It never did.<br /><br />The only part of the movie I liked was the WHEN IN ROME song they played during the closing credits.  I liked it because the song was nostalgic and because it was during the credits, which meant the movie was over.  Yah!!
B0009I7NNA|4.0|alot of people were dissapointed with this album, but it is a nice change. if you have the first 2 albums then you can always hear it. it shouldnt really matter.although i am getting sick of all the labels...
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Director Peter Jackson did a remarkable job in re-making a big-budget KK movie with JURASSIC PARK type special effects.  In doing so, he actually dug out the original script from the 1930s and inserted many scenes that were cut out of the original film as they didn't have the technology to pull it off.<br /><br />It can be said that one can skip the entire first hour of the film without missing much insofar as KK is concerned.  However, the build-up of suspense does pay off when they finally reach the mysterious island.  Also, there are in the first hour a few nice allusions to Fay Wray as well as RCO productions, which made the original 1930s film.<br /><br />The island is the centerpiece of the movie.  They spend a lot more time on it than did the 1970s film, and they go ballistic with all the creepy creatures that they create.  The whole premise of the island is rather interesting:  what if there were a locale on the planet that was so isolated from the rest of the world that evolution went bananas in a variety of directions, while some other long-extinct creatures endured, becoming suspended in time?<br /><br />Naomi Watts proves herself to be worthy of following in the footsteps of Fay Wray and Jessica Lange (I won't mention the farcical KING KONG LIVES starring Linda Hamilton).  The Australian beauty is a great actress who also easily passes for an acrobat.<br /><br />Any fans of KING KONG must add this to their collection.  While everyone already knows the story (whether they've seen the 1930s original or not), it's still worth watching all over again - and again!
B000063147|5.0|This album is original work. People who only get the \\"City of Evil\\" album are truly missing out. A7X made this album at 17. a very big accomplishment for such a young age. I think that this album should be called one of the classics. You can tell that their influences played a big part, because it is obvious, by their sound, the compilation of various artists that this album comes from. BTW, they are the mystery guest at Ozzfest, go to Ozzfest and see them on the main stage!!!
B0009VRHLK|5.0|This movie has a lot of moments that can make the viewer feel awkward or uncomfortable, with very slow pacing and, especially towards the end, with material that seems more [...] (I don't think it could have possibly been a real body part, by the way). One starts to wonder what is this all leading up to? This movie, however, needs to be seen in its entirety and then all of its parts will make sense, nothing is really done without reason; only then will the viewer realize what a masterpiece it is.    It is kind of like a retelling of Huckleberry Finn, the plot consisting of nothing more than a journey, except in this film, with the loss of childhood innocence. It is interesting to note that when the young Bud and Daisy first made their way to the wonders of California, escaping the drudgery of their life in rural Buffalo, NY, they really ended up in the same place from where they started, back to suburbia hell, except this time with palm trees and smaller houses. One can also look at this movie as a retelling of the Great Gatsby, as well.     Pay close attention to the different narrative styles. Throughout much of the film, Vincent Gallo's character is telling his story, which is really more narrated to himself than to an audience; the filming is very choppy and at times out of focus or some of the action is actually off-screen (so much so that it makes you think that Gallo just set up the camera and is actually doing all the filming himself). There's not a whole lot of talking, as he travels from one motor bike race to another. He seems almost lost, even though he knows the route. At the end of the film, when he meets up with Daisy and they talk together, for the first time we see Vincent Gallo's character and much of the action  in clear focus in the full frame and there's more of a dialogue. Gallo has done an excellent and thoughful way of presenting the characters, by portraying inner and personal dialogues, feelings, thoughts, emotions that all go on inside theperson versus an outside perspective, how one appears to others from the outside, that can still be revealing about a person.    I thought the female actreses were all great, especially Cheryl Tiegs and Chloe Sevigny. Gallo uses the \\"flower\\" girls/women cleverly to represent the different stages of Daisy's life, and yet shows that as a person, Daisy is irreplacable.    Gallo has made an incredible film, exploring an area of life most directors wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole, and yet affects us all, or at least some aspects of it.
B00025ETIW|4.0|I am young, but informed. their first CD had more of a raw sound to it. I liked them more then, because not every single 13 yr. old knew they existed. I find it really sad, that every band i like gets so popular, that they have to change to please the \\"new\\" crowd. Or what bothers me is when you go to their show, and all the kids sing along to every song, until they reach a song on their old album, and then they just look confused. Buy the old CD first.
0920668372|1.0|I bought this book because I heard it was so touching and about a mom and her little boy.  I read it when I got home and went right back to return it!  It was terrible.. weird... creapy...bizzare ... the whole bit!   Check out \\"Guess how much I love you\\" about the two bunnies instead.  I read that one every night to my 4 month old.  I cried the first time I read it.  It is a great, short read.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I am 15, and trust me, ive been listening to Lamb of God, since I was 13. This is wonderful. Death Metal at its finest. I also recommend Burn the Priest, Lamb of God's previous band. To me it seems a tad bit harder, and higher pitched vocals, but definetily an album to add to the collection. The only thing that sucks about this. is that everyone knows about them now. it would of been nice to keep them at a quiet, but popularity overpowers...
0894803123|5.0|I found a previous version of this book at a local used book store and was absolutely delighted with the range of recipes and ideas.  There are three different bases given for ice creams, a multitude of recipes ranging from basic flavors to \\"mix-in\\" heaven, and additional ideas for sorbets and ices.  We have been very happy with this little book and our \\"new to us\\" old ice cream maker -- I highly recommend picking up two copies, one for you and one to share or give as a gift!
B000053ZRR|3.0|Bon Jovi are by far the greatest live band in the world, but the awesome live performance and atmosphere that anyone who has ever been to one of their concerts knows, is not apparent watching this DVD.  This DVD makes the great ones' performance look rather average, which is just plain wrong.  Like with the live CD that was released around the time of the Crush Tour you can not even hear the Zurich crowd in most songs with the producers seeming to care more about having studio quality sound, which I might add they did not always achieve. In fact Livin' on a Prayer and You give Love a Bad Name are the exact same recording as was on that album.  All shots looking at the stage are way above the crowd's heads meaning you don't get the concert attendees perspective at all.  Lots of editing means you also miss out on all the stuff between songs as well as a fair few of the songs as well.  Jon Bon Jovi mentions in the 30 minute \\"backstage\\" program extra, that the band would never turn up to a concert and reduce a two and half hour show to only two hours as that would not only cheat the fans but cheat themselves as well.  Yet this is exactly what those who put together this DVD did.<br /><br />You can also get better live versions of the songs on here on other DVDs or bonus songs that came with their singles.  The, photo gallery, discography and film clips for the songs It's My Life and Say it Isn't So and 30 minute \\"backstage\\" program are pretty good.  It would have been nice though if they could have taken off their sunglasses during the interviews, but Jon did explain in the DVD he was doing this to hide his wrinkles.<br /><br />Bon Jovi are by far the greatest live performers there have ever been.  Definitely make sure you have seen these guys at least once before they retire which hopefully is not for a while. Don't pay too much for this very average DVD though.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|The 1990s saw a slow disintegration of the core members of Fleetwood Mac.   This actually started in 1987 when Lindsey Buckingham left the band.   Despite a brief reunion with Buckingham in 1992 for Bill Clinton's inauguration - the disintegration would continue when Stevie Nicks would leave the band shortly after that.   Core members Mick Fleetwood, John and Christine McVie attempted to carry on - even bringing in veteran musician Dave Mason into the band.    1995's \\"Time\\" was the first album in over 20 years without Buckingham and Nicks.   Overall the new lineup  that featured Mason, Bekka Bramlett, and Billy Burnette just didn't catch on.   Things would change in the late 1980s when the core members slowly got back together resulting in a live album reunion - \\"The Dance\\".    \\"The Dance\\" was probably one of the best live albums ever made - namely because the live performance captured the passion and emotion that Fleetwood Mac fans had come to expect.   With the momentum of the reunion in place, Fleetwood Mac seemed back on track.  That was until Christine McVie decided to \\"retire\\" from the band.   However, the remaining core members decided to carry on resulting in 2003's \\"Say You Will\\" album.    The big question would be - could Fleetwood Mac continue the momentum of \\"The Dance\\" without Christine McVie. <br /> <br />Without Christine McVie, Fleetwood Mac not only lost their keyboardist - but lost one of their key songwriters.   Stevie Nicks fills McVie's place on keyboards and she as Buckingham now work on the songwriting.   As has been historically the case with Fleetwood Mac, there are no songwriting collaborations between Buckingham and Nicks.   There are nine songs each contributed by Buckingham and Nicks.  In some cases, outside songwriters are brought in.   In general, I have always felt that when Fleetwood Mac started relying on outside songwriters - this was a problem.    This was something that was done on the \\"Mirage\\" album back in 1982.  One of the bigcomplaints I had with that album is that the use of outside songwriters took away from the emotion that always was a trademark between these artists.   Overall, while I do feel this is an admirable effort by Fleetwood Mac, there is no doubt that this album lacks the emotion that I would have come to expect from the first studio album in 16 years that would reunite Buckingham and Nicks. <br /> <br />One thing that is still present is Fleetwood Mac's experimentation.  This album probably is the most experimental album since \\"Tusk\\".   Much of this experimentation comes from the Buckingham contributions.  However even Nicks expands her boundaries.  Nicks, who is mostly known for writing songs that are personal and of a relationship nature comes up with September 11th inspired \\"Illume\\".   There are cases where the experimentation doesn't work.   I'm really not sure what Buckingham is trying to do with \\"Red Rover\\".   While it does feature some riveting guitar work by Buckingham, ultimately I don't think this song is destined to be a Fleetwood Mac classic.  Experimentation also doesn't work on \\"Come\\" (although there is a better version on the \\"Live in Boston\\" CD/DVD set).  However Buckingham shouldn't be knocked entirely because on \\"Miranda\\" the experimentation does seem to work.   \\"Miranda\\" starts out with almost a \\"Big Love\\" instrumental (from \\"Tango in the Night\\").    Buckingham opts for some unorthodox vocals.  The song then almost gives the feel of a Talking Heads type of song on the chorus when Nicks joins in.   \\"Miranda\\" also has some interesting background sound effects as well and some outstanding guitar work at the end. <br /> <br />Fleetwood Mac also goes into some more social commentary on this album.   As mentioned \\"Illume\\" is Stevie Nicks' September 11th inspired track.    The lyrics such as  \\"I'm alone now; With my thoughts; Of how we could make it; Of how we could get out\\".   This song took a while for me to get into.  While I wouldn't call this an all-time classic Fleetwood Mac tune, it still is a good tune - and it is a good demonstration of Fleetwood Mac exploring a socio-political angle.   This song also features some good guitar work heard in the background by Buckingham.   Buckingham makes his own socio-political track on \\"Murrow Turning Over in His Grave\\".   This song could also be classified as an \\"experimental\\" track - as it has a folk angle.   This song basically is an attack on the media as demonstrated with the lyrics \\"Cause being guilty is just good business.\\"   I'd put this song in the category of \\"Illume\\" - good track, but falls short of being an overall Fleetwood Mac classic.    <br /> <br />There are some very good tracks on this collection.   Perhaps the best track is the Nicks' contributed \\"Thrown Down\\".   This song almost has a bit of a feel to \\"Gypsy\\" with both the guitar work and the gentle Buckingham background vocals.   Nicks' best songs always find a way to get Buckingham in the fold with vocals - and this is no exception.   Nicks'  \\"Silver Girl\\" has a musical feel almost like \\"Two Kinds of Love\\" (a duet that Nicks did with Bruce Hornsby on \\"The Other Side of the Mirror\\").  This song features Sheryl Crow on the guitar.    Another good song by Nicks is \\"Destiny Rules\\".  This song has a bit of the country-influence that Nicks has infused in her music before (namely seen back on \\"Bella Donna\\"). <br /> <br />Buckingham makes some very good contributions as well.  \\"What's the World Coming To\\" and \\"Peacekeeper\\" are two solid contributions.   Both of these songs have much more of a classic \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" feel to them.   This song also features a polished studio version of \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" (featuring Christine McVie making a \\"guest\\" appearance on keyboards).   This version is probably better than the live one on \\"The Dance\\".  Listen to how crisp Mick Fleetwood's percussion is. <br /> <br />With 18 tracks, there should be enough for a Fleetwood Mac fan to find something.  However, this album doesfall short when compared to Fleetwood Mac's past accomplishments.
B00005JO20|5.0|The truth is, most people thought of King Kong as a joke. Sure, the original, way back when, was apparently scary to audiences. But today, the clumsy little stop-motion gorilla doesn't have the power to do much with current audiences. Certainly not scare them. The campy 1970s remake -- with the very timely energy crisis subplot --  doesn't really do it for today's audiences either.<br /><br />Peter Jackson remembered, though, that Kong used to terrify audiences. Lucky us.<br /><br />The 21st century King Kong not only features an utterly convincing giant gorilla and actual compelling characters and a great Depression-era setting, it also is the scariest dinosaur/giant monster movie to date. The bug scene will send arachnophobes screaming for the door and Kong versus not one, not two, but three tyrannosaurs makes the Jurassic Park series look like a lot of smoke and mirrors. Combined with the best version of Kong's climactic stand-off with the fighter planes, this is easily the best version of the classic story to date.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this all adds up to a long, long movie. It's worth it, but be prepared for at least one intermission along the way.<br /><br />Peter Jackon's King Kong gets my highest possible recommendation for fans of the previous films, the Jurassic Park series, the radiant Naomi Watts, Peter Jackson or giant monster movies in general. Great, thrilling stuff.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Not much to like here.  As interesting and well done as the movie is from a visual standpoint, I couldn't have cared less about the characters.  Everyone in the aptly named Sin City is morally bankrupt.  They do all the wrong things for the \\"right\\" reasons, which usually means rescuing a damsel in distress from a child molester or serial killer cannibal.  Violence is the norm in this twisted bizarro world.  In addition to routine shootings you'll also find neck-slashing, impaling, amputation, beheading and body parts being ripped out.  At times I felt like I was watching a horror movie, especially when Alexis Bledel shows up as a double-crossing hooker. <br /> <br />All the stories in this movie take place only at night, and the whole thing is shot in stark black and white with a few splashes of color here and there.  The tough guy \\"heroes\\" talk in hoarse, low voices, even when they're not doing hokey film noir narration.  As much as I love Clive Owen, he comes across as laughable at times, but the big surprise here is Rosario Dawson.  She does an amazing job with what she's given. <br />
B000E8N690|5.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" isn't just an admirable improvisation; it is a great movie.  Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) live out the classic love story.  He is in love with her, but she is usually unavailable or uninterested.  There are other fascinating storylines available, too.  The movie illuminates his difficult childhood with his brother's tragedy and his father's abuse.  We also feel the anguish of an artist before he becomes famous.  He must start with an unfulfilling marriage and an unrewarding sales job before he gets to become fulfilled in life.  The steps after success aren't always uplifting either.  He goes through infidelity, drinking, and drug abuse before he sees the light of what success and happiness can really garner.      Perenially, it has been said that the performances in \\"Walk the Line\\" are remarkable.  True enough.  The story's presentation is marvelous, though, too.  It could have been assembled any way, but we start and end with the \\"Folsum Prison\\" concert, creating the anticipation and closure we need.  The country music performances are intertwined with scenes about John and June's relationship, and all of it is worthwhile.  While many comments have been made about Joaquin's reinactment of the music, it is engaging enough to work well.  (Subjectively, one of the best scenes in the movie is when Joaquin and Reese perform \\"It Ain't Me Babe,\\" a Bob Dylan song.)  \\"Walk the Line\\" is an excellent movie that doesn't require the viewer to like country music (although it certainly helps). The movie is a sincere and flattering portrait of an honest and uncompromising man who was genuine and human enough to represent the tragedies and concerns of all people who struggle in daily life.  The movie doesn't make a legend, but it certainly celebrates one.
B000063DFS|5.0|This album features what is in my opinion Ozzy's best overall line-up. Mike Inez is an awesome bass player. The bass line in No More Tears is simply genius. Randy Castillo was and awesome drummer. I think that this album is Zakk Wylde's best acheivement as far as his guitar playing. Zakk's solos on this album seem to be some of his best written. Zakk's solos sound much better and well written when compared to his more recent work where he just shreds for the entire solo. Ozzy sounds as good as ever on this album. I would not consider any of the songs on this album as fillers.  The bonus tracks are both EXCELLENT making this release a better buy. I HIGHLY recomend this to fans of Zakk Wylde. The songs on this album are very complete and well put together and all in all this is just one truly outstanding album. If you like just one song off this album a lot then buy it, there is plenty more good material on this album.  <br />Highlights: everything <br />Throw-aways: Nothing

B00003CX9S|5.0|Allow me to start out by saying that I hate biopic-type movies. They usually tend to be formulaic and trite, and they often either reduce extraordinary lives into ordinary ones, or take such liberties with the truth that they cease to have any meaning. The Elephant Man is, though, a glorious exception. Filmed in black and white with the visual flair that only comes from a visionary director (in this case, David Lynch), The Elephant Man is the story of John Merrick, a man whose horrible disfigurement has left him unable to live a normal live, to exist in society, or even to make a living--he has to be paraded as a freak in order to survive. He is eventually discovered by Frederick Treves, a London doctor who is interested in John's medical case. Treves eventually finds John to be an intelligent and sensitive man, and while Merrick begins to find acceptance among the hospital staff and London society, Treves struggles with his own guilt about using John to elevate his own career. It is the journeys that the two men take which form the backbone of this film, which includes more than a few genuinely touching moments. John Hurt, previously best known for being the ill-fated incubator for the alien in Alien, delivers one of the most astonishing performances in film history here--he becomes this man, down to the body language, speech, and subtext--there is little suspension of disbelief required here. Anthony Hopkins plays Treves with quiet dignity and humanity, showing again why he is one of his generation's greatest actors. Plaudits also go to John Gielgud as the hospital governor and Anne Bancroft as a sympathetic London stage actress who champion's Merrick's cause. <br /> <br />Unlike most biopics, this one actually shows the struggles and triumphs of its character. Merrick desires nothing more than what should be his birthright--a normal life. Ultimately, this is impossible. He nevertheless manages to find happiness--and even joy--thanks to the kindness of Treves andhis staff. That he was able to achieve even this modest goal, in spite of his massive physical ailments and disfigurement, is something which is truly inspiring. If the society we live in is one which is excessively preoccupied with appearances, then The Elephant Man is a film which offers an impassioned rebuttal against such thinking, and even though it is very sad, it is ultimately uplifting in that it provides an example of the triumph of the human spirit, at risk of spouting cliche. It follows some of the genre conventions, but it all seems fresh and interesting, like a work of literature, not a dime-store potboiler.  <br /> <br />This film should have won several Oscars but didn't win a single one. It is interesting to note that the year in which this film was produced, 1980, was also the year of Raging Bull and Ordinary People, which makes three modern classics made in a single year. Has there been a similar situation in the last decade? Ultimately, these movies were the end of an era, the glorious cinema of the 1970s, where authenticity and truth were the watchwords of film. This is a movie which doesn't try to sugar-coat the story of its subject, but lets the subject speak for himself, and thusly becomes an extraordinary picture.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|Legendary lover, Casanova (Heath Ledger), is the amore' of many beautiful Venetian woman.  His predilection is to deflower innocent women, and his favorite market is the local nunnery.  He can be considered a popular or a notorious lover, depending on whom you ask.  Nevertheless, his escapades only get him into deep trouble with the local chapter of the Inquisition.  (Back then sins were crimes and could be negotiated at a high price.)  In all fairness the local bishop is kind and merciful, a safe haven for the frolicking young lethario.  But, the bishop's resourcefulness has limits, and it is at one point that he makes an ultimatum:  Casanova must avoid further trouble, marry someone, and stay chaste until his wedding day.  Predictably, it is then that he finds the love of his life, Francesca (Sienna Miller), but finds his interest unrequited.  (One of the great aspects of the movie is her mature philosophy about love.  She so articulately presents the difference between love and lust in all its forms and expressions.)  Ironically, just when he keeps his nose the cleanest, Casanova gets into the most trouble.  He takes several identities to allude the grasp of the Inquisition and weaves the greatest deceptions to woo the interest of Francesca, while staying out of the tangles of many courtship connections.  Casanova easily evades the grasp of the Inquisition until the head is replaced by the highly motivated Cardinal Pucci (Jeremy Irons).  Then, it starts to get tricky.    This movie is thoroughly pleasant and fun-filled.  The lines are often witty, the characters are enjoyable, and the costumes and scenery are eye-catching.  There is a formula at work, though:  The movie contains dueling and wooing, as well as several chase scenes.  However, the movie's execution is notably smooth and skillful.  The handling of the story is often original and not always predictable.  It must also be said the classical music (Vivaldi, et al) makes the mood magnificent, even more sothan most movies.  Similar pictures are often tiresome, but this one is easy to follow.  The viewer can see this movie without having to concentrate too much on the plot.  The atmosphere is breezy enough to be pleasant, but absorbing and exciting enough to be substantial.
B000031WBV|5.0|Although most of people tend to consider, Chopin' s Nocturnes as tearful salon pieces,  they perhaps retains, with major effervescence than any other genre composed by him, the essential principles that support  the Romantic  mood. The night conceived as a frame for the febrile imagination, that may originate the most beautiful dreams or on the contrary the most horrid nightmares.<br /><br />\\"Chopin loved the night and its soft mysteries as much as did Robert Louis Stevenson, and his nocturnes are true night pieces, some with agitated, remorseful countenance, others seen are whispering at dusk.\\" ...\\"He ennobled the form originated by Field, giving it dramatic breadth, passion and even grandeur.\\" These smart considerations belong to James Huneker (1860--1921) the famed author and music and drama critic.<br /><br />Under this perspective any analysis around Chopin should be done according the specified genre you consider, due it would explain preconceived attitudes and superficial generalizations that frequently lead to trivial thoughts and originate distorted and deformed opinions around the egregious figure of the beloved Polish composer.<br /><br />There have been three famed and renowned pianists that have shone with radiant splendor at the moment to play this set of Nocturnes. Of course that Rubinstein was one of them, (the others two are Samson Francois and Alfred Cortot), and the reason why they are above the most, resides in the fact they played every one of these works, with a special connotation and intimate atmosphere. As Huneker previously emphasized, every Nocturne has its particular blaze, texture, color, personality and expression.<br /><br />So if you want to experiment a true experience listening this set of Nocturnes, don' t think it over and acquire it.
1400079179|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable read.<br /><br />The hype that's been going on around this book is ridiculous.<br /><br />People contesting whether the Davinci Code holds truth vs truth according to the Bible.<br /><br />The bible is a compilation of stories, non of which can be proven historically, which is why it's called faith.<br /><br />The only factual content we can glean from both are validation of historical sites.<br /><br />If you are interested in the evolution of current religion over the last few hundred years, I highly recommend Riane Eisler's &#34;The Chalice and The Blade.&#34;<br /><br />I am glad to see the sacred feminine ideology being introduced back into our society in a time where it is desperately needed.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Hoffman's acting was superb! I sat up and took notice, despite finding myself disliking the personality of Capote as portrayed in the film. The movie showed a man who straddled the line of confidence and arrogance. I found the fact that his friends stuck by him and overlooked his flaws in personality very commendable, even when he was rude or seemed to use people for his own gain in popularity, which he appeared to have the need to feed off of constantly. Despite all that, Capote was a master storyteller and I was grateful they showed a more 'human' side of him toward the end.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000068FXR|4.0|I guess its just a common trait for supergroups that to characterize a band as such - its an incidental part of their status to come up with an album filled with splendid tracks but goes unnoticed by the masses, like with Queen's HOT SPACE, Yes' TORMATO, and LED ZEP's LP that followed HOUSES OF THE HOLY - thus is the case being for this here the fourth album release from one of the most remarkable bands on this side of the progressive \\"art-rock\\" music genre (and one of me all time favourites nonetheless) - the group, Supertramp.    Other purist fans would claim to the point of spite and say that their BREAKFAST IN AMERICA album comes as a sell-out (perhaps those who'd say so only hated the idea that the album sold out so well selling millions of copies) being that the band moved on by stripping down to regular-lenght tracks against the group's usual stance of coming up with lenghty ones as 'twas the thing of their day, on the contrary had this album (a follow up to the breakthrough LP CRIME OF THE CENTURY) laid out in that format comprising of 10 tracks (which would've been eleven supposedly, but Supertramp's sax player John Helliwell (no relations to those of the SPICE GIRLS, me thinks) ordains the dis-inclusion of the track \\"You Started Laughing\\" due to the interest of sound quality - given by the vinyl groove, reasons that are completely alien and incomprehensible for the less enlightened post- seventies born generation (that's been issued as a b-side for the \\"45 single of \\"Lady\\", a track which succinctly embodied the stuff which makes 'TRAMP a great band, being that they don't give a hoot if some would cite them as uncool with their carnival-like no holds bar type of sound which definitely rocks in its own way, pitting Hodgson and the band as distinctly nothing short of themselves of defining coolness to its most undefiable degree as a rule within itself)).      Prior to the time of having a copy of this LP along with the group's EVEN IN THE QUIETEST MOMENTS, the album that followed this one as a major fan of 'TRAMP (no I'm not speaking of the TRAMMPS who'd a ditty called \\"Burn Baby Burn\\")-- I've mistakenly attributed to think that some of the tracks that are carried in this album have rather appeared there, such as \\"A Soapbox Opera\\", and \\"Another Man's Woman\\". Hodgson is totally devoid of any restriction with his own way for the delivery he pours down on \\"The Meaning\\", which cumulates to the album's poignant conclusion, the closer track \\"Two Of Us\\" (not the Beatle title; however in that regard having mentioned the ever fantabulous Beatles, this album like its predecessor was also produced by Ken Scott who've worked on the fab-four's 1965 legendary LP RUBBER SOUL).    The album containing Davies' (who sports wearing a blue shirt in his blue suit that pictures this album's cover on the inner sleeve of the following album '...QUIETEST MOMENTS...') \\"Ain't Nobody But Me\\", a track which displays his dry british wit, as one of the featured singles for the album - opened with similar birds chirping to that of the immaculate title track for EVEN IN THE QUIETEST MOMENTS, as an intro to its first track in the album \\"Easy Does It\\", which is easily identifiable as an intro track to open for Hodgson's endearing song \\"Sister Moonshine\\" (a predecessor so akin of sorts to one of their biggest hits \\"Give A Little Bit\\", the track that opened the following album '...QUIETEST MOMENTS...'), CRISIS? WHAT CRISIS? is an outstanding album of the high caliber kind. I love this album. Shouldn't be missed.    Hope they re-issue it out with the missing \\"You Started Laughing\\" track.     A significant great work from Supertramp.
1594200823|5.0|The information contained in this text is simply mind-boggling.  The author has done a brilliant job researching and writing this intriguing book about our nation's food supply.  It answers the questions we have always wondered but no pursued;  What does organic really mean?  How much corn do we consume?  Why is corn subsidized by the US government?  Can a farm be a self-contained unit or must we industrialize farming?  How can we slaughter chickens for food at only 2 months of age?  The answer: CORN. <br /> <br />This book receives a high recommendation from me, especially for those inquisitive minds out there.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|I've tried to ignore it. I've tried to make fun of it. I've even tried hiding it from my jaded friends. But I am afraid I can no longer do any of these things: I am openly declaring my allegiance to Panic! at the Disco and their fun, c'mon-sing-along-now debut album, A FEVER YOU CAN'T SWEAT OUT. <br /> <br />Panic! started out as a Las Vegas-based quartet, fresh out of high school and gaining popularity by sheer word of mouth. Despite their undoubted similarities to Fall Out Boy (a band I despise) and subsequent mainstream recognition, I have, from my first listen of \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies,\\" knew there was something going on here. What surprised me most was that I liked it. The lyrics are unendingly clever (\\"Well she's not bleeding on the ballroom floor just for the attention / 'Cause that's just ridiculous...ly on\\") and lead singer Brendon Urie preaches with such fast-paced enthusiasm that you have no choice but to hold on as he blazes through all twelve tracks. But Urie is really just a figurehead for the band, despite the fact his high-pitched, Wentz-esque voice isn't exactly enchanting. The real brains behind Panic! at the Disco is songwriter/guitarist Ryan Ross, who pens the pop-culture sermons but keeps it zipped. <br /> <br />The songs range from your typical cliched we're-some-20-year-olds-trying-to-make-a-difference (\\"London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines\\") to touchy, real-life experiences (Ross writes about his father's alcoholism in \\"Camisado\\") to berating immoral preachers (\\"I Constantly Thank God For Esteban\\") with fluid transition. And then there's the song titles themselves (which may be paying homage to Sufjan Stevens as much as Fall Out Boy), with lengths that make my iPod cry, like \\"There's A Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought of it Yet\\" and \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide is Press Coverage,\\" which obviously reflect the feelings of Ross if not the band as a whole. <br /> <br/>I do harbor a certain resentment for Panic!, however, since they are headlining a tour in which the Dresden Dolls (one of my very favorite bands) are merely opening for them. This is heartbreaking, because Panic! garnered fame for their Fall Out Boy-friendly sound, which isn't anything new, and the Dresden Dolls have actually brought something to the table that you don't see everyday (which of course means that America holds bands like the Pussycat Dolls in higher esteem... shudder). <br /> <br />Either way, expect to see great things from Panic! at the Disco in the future, if not for their literary genius than for their upbeat technopop, which not only gathers thousands of shallow teenagers who just wanna have fun, but hundreds of people who examine the words behind the music - and try to pick out the real message within.

As he unravels the mystery, Reacher is assisted by Lauren Pauling, a former FBI agent in charge of the kidnapping of Lane's first wife, Anne.  Paying close attention to the details is what helps Reacher and Pauling stay ahead of Lane.  Engrossing writing that when focused on the characters is tautly written.  Overall, it is an exciting, riveting thriller.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|is because I saw them live and nothing compares to it. It was an unearlthly experience. Yes, they really sound the same way they do on the album kids. That same etherial feeling is there except BETTER. I had the insense urge to get up and start dancing through the entire show (being a dancer that was my urge...I'm not guaranteeing that it will happen to everyone haha). So my point is, if you think that this or any of their other albums are magical, you MUST see them live. It's like nothing you've ever seen or heard. Just hearing my favorite songs from this album (tracks 6 and 8, especially 6...sorry I don't exactly have the names burned in my head) in full sound resonating through the theater I was in was one of the most damned amazing things I've ever heard. So go see them live!! I saw them in Cleveland so I know they go to more than just ginormous cities...oh and if you can't see them live then please do yourself a favor and just buy all their stuff. Okay I'm done raving...peace and lovin.

B00000IPAX|4.0|if you are a rock fan of any kind you really do not care about american idol or the fact that the lead singer could pass the try outs. with that said this is a funny and classic cd for this band, it also showcased the serious side of them with \\"adams song\\" (which is a great song). you should also check out the 3 cd's before it and see why they will always have a fan base.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Well, this is probably one of the best known Blink albums of their whole career! Here's my review on the songs: <br /> <br />Dumpweed: Fast paced, pretty good. 9/10 <br />Don't Leave Me: One of my favorites on the cd!! 10/10 <br />Aliens Exist: Not really all that good. 8/10 <br />Going Away To College: To me, this seems like sad song, and i like it alot. 9.5/10 <br />What's My Age Again?: Over-played too much, but still one of the good ones! 10/10 <br />Dysentery Gary: Haha, i laugh about the lyrics to this song... it's pretty good. 9.5/10 <br />Adam's Song: Probably my favorite song on Enema! 100/10 :-P <br />All The Small Things: Once again, another over-played song but still awesome! 10/10 <br />The Party Song: I can't really understand the lyrics too much, but it's fun to listen to Mark sing that fast. 9/10 <br />Mutt: Another one of my favorites big time! 10/10 <br />Wendy Clear: I hated it... didn't make sense to me. 6.5/10 <br />Anthem: Umm... it's alright i guess. But i hear that Anthem Pt. 2 on Take off Your Pants and Jacket is much better, but still it has some good lyrics. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />
B0009X7664|5.0|It is likely that most people reading this review are already familiar with the classic movie,  TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, so I'm not going to say much about the movie itself other than to say, if you have not watched this movie, you are missing one of the very best movies ever made. It is one of the rare instances where the movie is almost as good as the book, written by Harper Lee.<br /><br />This is the Legacy Series edition of this movie and contains additional features for ardent fans of this incredible work. Contained here, along with the movie on disc one, are Gregory Peck's Academy Award acceptance speech for best actor, his remarks from the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, an excerpt from the Academy's tribute to Gregory Peck, an interview with Mary Badham (Scout), feature commentary from the Director and Producer and the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Disc two includes a well produced documentary titled \\"A Conversation with Gregory Peck\\" where Peck reminisces his stellar career and interacts with audiences and past co-stars. Here Peck's somewhat controversial social activism is touched on, which may be a turn off to some as he was a staunch and vocal advocate of gun control, withdrawal from Viet Nam and other activist issues of that age. This disc also includes the making of the movie, which is an exceptional feature.<br /><br />Also included in the Legacy Series edition are eleven matted reproductions of original theatrical posters, which would be suitable for framing for collectors of such memorabilia. This is all housed in a sturdy and attractive book-type case. If you don't already own this movie, I highly recommend this edition.

B00006JSS8|4.0|It's kind of ironic because this album is my first Stevie Wonder CD I've bought. But now that I know what I was missing, I don't want it to happen to other people.   Let me list some of the BEST songs that this disc is missing  - Isn't She Lovely  - Golden Lady  - As  - Send One Your Love  - Ribbon In The Sky  - Visions  - Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing  - Send One Your Love  - Lately  etc.    I'm pretty sure there are people who think those missing songs can make up a better collection.     So don't even bother with this one and save money for these packages  - At The Close Of A Century (4 CD Box Set)  - Natural Wonder (2 CD Set LIVE)  - Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants (Tied with INNERVISIONS for Stevie's best album)    13 bucks was well worth for me to be introduced to the greatness of Stevie Wonder. So I don't regret anyway.
0385336691|4.0|At the beginning of Lee Child's latest thriller, \\"The Hard Way,\\" Jack Reacher is sitting in a New York cafe sipping a double espresso and minding his own business.  However, as always, trouble finds Reacher wherever he goes.  Soon, Jack is deeply involved in a search for the kidnapper of a beautiful woman named Kate Lane and her eight-year-old daughter, Jade.  Kate's husband, Edward Lane, assisted by his cadre of loyal ex-military mercenaries, is desperate to find whoever took his wife and stepdaughter and he is willing to pay Reacher a hefty sum for his services.<br /><br />Using his considerable savvy as a former army investigator, Reacher begins to look into the case, but he soon gets the feeling that there are key facts that he is missing.  Helping him to uncover the truth are Patti Joseph, the sister of Edward Lane's first wife, Anne, and Lauren Pauling, a retired FBI special agent turned private investigator.  As time passes, Reacher begins to realize that he has become involved in a complex and ugly situation made much worse by secrets, lies, and a nasty cover-up.<br /><br />Reacher must make full use of his sharp powers of observation and analysis to pick up subtle clues that others miss.  His brain proves to be a more potent weapon than his considerable brawn, and most readers will root for this strong man who resorts to violence only as a last resort.  There is a riveting scene in which Reacher interviews a crippled man who survived unspeakable torture and was left severely maimed.  Even an individual as hardened as Reacher cannot help but feel compassion for someone who is in so much pain.<br /><br />The one-dimensional villain is a stereotypical psychopath, which makes him an uninteresting, albeit formidable foe.  In addition, Child doesn't humanize Reacher here as much as he has in the past, and our hero comes across as a bit too terse and robotic.  However, to Child's credit, he does allow Reacher to make several serious errors in judgment that later come back to haunt him. The bloody ending has Child casting Reacher in the familiar role of the lonely cowboy pitted against a band of evil desperadoes.  \\"The Hard Way\\" offers escapist entertainment, a few surprising twists, and a dollop of romance, but it lacks the freshness and excitement of Child's best work.he bloody ending has Child casting Reacher in the familiar role of the lonely cowboy pitted against a band of evil desperadoes.  \\"The Hard Way\\" offers escapist entertainment, a few surprising twists, and a dollop of romance, but it lacks the freshness and excitement of Child's best work.
B000F48CD8|4.0|When creating The White Stripes, Jack White had specific rules he wanted the band, which only included his ex-wife Meg, to follow right down to the color scheme both members must always follow be it red, black, or white. Another key ingredient was that they could only record song that could be played that way live, which meant only no more than two instruments per song. This led to a garage rock revolution and the simplicity was refreshing. <br /> <br />After years without wavering from those rules, Jack White has finally put the ex-wife on the back-burner and joined other Detroit rockers including Brandon Benson who trades vocals and guitar riffs with White as The Raconteurs on their debut Broken Boy Soldiers. The album starts off with Steady As She Goes that eases The White Stripes fans by starting off with a simple drum beat, then switches to a bass before the guitar comes in as if Jack was taking baby steps as he enters the world of more than two instruments per song. The song even sounds like it could have been a White Stripes song had White lifted his strict rule against songs that couldn't be played live by just the two of them. <br /> <br />But not all the songs have the White Stripes with more musicians sound to it. The very next song Hands, as well later on the album with Intimate Secretary, sound something out of the 60's British Invasion era with harmonizing vocals and all. The title track sounds like it could have been an outtake from an early Led Zeppelin recording session. In fact the album seems to go back and forth between the two time periods throughout the album. <br /> <br />On the balled Together Benson taking lead vocals with a less abrasive voice than White so the song comes off more sweet yet depressing at the same time, something White himself could not pull off during his tenure in his duo. But White is back in the spotlight on the album closer Blue Veins. The bluesy song where White goes on his full Robert Plant impression send chills donethe spine and will fuel the fire of rock fans across the globe as they argue whether White should do another White Stripes or Raconteurs album next.
B000002OHX|4.0|Wishbone Ash deserved better, I thought this album would be there breakout in America and make them a superstar band.  I rate this CD 4 1/2 stars.  A great live collection that ranks up their with Humble Pie/Rockin the Fillmore, and the Allman Brothers Band at the Fillmore East.  Live Dates holds it's own with the above mentioned bands.      This was recorded over June 1973 during their tour of England and featured their best lineup- Andy Powell, Steve Upton, and the Turners.  Live Dates features the songs from their creative peak, and the audience is vocal throughout the duo guitar assault, responding to the incredible harmonics, interplay, melodies woven around each epic song.      I can only describe Wishbone Ash as being similar to progressive rock group Yes, subtracting the keyboards and then adding another lead guitarist.  Martin Turner's vocals remind me a little of Jon Andersons' singing for Yes.  This is a vague comparison for those who have never listened to Wishbone Ash.  The songs Phoenix and The Pilgrim are numbers that are paced like Yes tracks, layered with great guitar work, interwoven, with Andy Powell and David \\"Ted\\" Turner working together and not fighting against each other. Their improvisation on these tracks are tremendous, with Phoenix lasting 17 minutes, and The Pilgrim lasting just over 9 minutes long.      Disc One is centered around British mythology, legend of King Arthur themes, Lord of the Rings, it seems to me.  The first 3 songs fit well together- The King Will Come, Warrior, and Throw Down The Sword, telling a story of battle in ancient England.      Rock n Roll Widow is the most commercial track on Disc One.  I didn't care too much for the Everly Brothers' remake-  Baby What You Want Me To Do.  The most commercial tracks on Disc Two are-  Jail Bait and Blowin' Free.  The Pilgrim and Phoenix songs were previously mentioned above.         Had the original lineup stayed together, maybe they would have eventually taken America by storm.  I could have pictured the Live Dates lineup recording songs for The Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter soundtracks.
B000ENV2P0|4.0|You can bet that I'm one of the biggest fans of RHCP.  But this special edition almost made me feel like I was ripped off.  2 CDs are really good. I gave 4 stars because their older albums - BSSM and By The Way deserve 5 stars.   It's impossible to compare 2CDs to one cd of previous albums.   But if you compare Jupiter OR Mars with BSSM, or By The Way, there's no way it's as good. The only way that Stadium Arcadium deserves 5 stars is to take the best out of 2CDs and put them in ONE disc. Mine would be like this  Not In Order  - Dani California  - Charlie  - Hump De Bump  - She's Only 18  - Slow Cheetah  - Strip My Mind  - Especially In Michigan  - Wet Sand  - Hey  - Descration Smile  - Tell Me Baby  - Hard To Concentrate  - 21st Century  - Make You Feel Better  - Turn It Again  - Death Of a Martian    Now that's 5 stars album.   I still prefer double discs because more is better but that doesn't the quantity gurantees the quality. There are really good songs like those above, and there are few fillers as well.   If you're a RHCP fan at all, you should get this. IMO, this album is their 3rd best behind BSSM and By The Way.   But again, I think it's a waste of money to get the special edition. The only thing that really counts in this edition is the DVD. I suggest you to borrow it from someone because you won't need to watch it too many times.   So just get the normal album for much cheaper!
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|This stupid parody of classic horror movies is garbage and the sequels are even worse. If you want to se a real comedy, watch either Caddyshack or Home Alone (and do not forget to se the sequel Home Alone 2). This movie is crap.
0679783261|5.0|When I walk into a bookstore, you'd rarely see me pick up a classic. I typically head straight to the Young Adult Fiction section, home to my favorite first-class, high-quality novels such as Gossip Girl, the A-List, and The Clique. However, this time I opted for a change, wanting to read, for once, a really good book. With the movie coming out, I decided to give Pride and Prejudice a try. I fully expected to put the book down forever after the first page or so--- it seems to me that most authors writing before the 21st century hadn't quite caught on to the method of captivating the reader in the first few sentences, or even chapters--- but I was surprised. From the start, Pride and Prejudice was interesting, humorous and engrossing. I read on. Taking my clean hardcover copy with me everywhere I went for the next couple weeks, I read whenever I had a spare moment. I loved the language, of both the chatty and funny narration and the dialogue of the interesting, loveable characters. Some phrases and words were unfamiliar, but instead of making it hard to understand, I caught on quickly... for example, a teenage female's 'coming out'. And another thing I loved about this book--- it wasn't just a typical love story. There were all sorts of twists and turns, most noteably with the crabby, snobby Mr. Darcy-- who, by the end, had captured the hearts of the readers as well as the characters. All in all, I'm so glad to have overcame my fears of boring, difficult-to-read 'classic' novels--- this book is really one that nobody should miss.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Coming from someone whose favorite RHCP song is either Don't Forget Me or Suck My Kiss, Stadium Arcadium wasn't quite what I had hoped for.  It is still a great album though and has some great songs.. Readymade being my personal favorite.  Evolution is inevitable, I suppose.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Madonna's Like A Prayer is my second favorite album, my first being Ray of Light. Like A Prayer is a classic, Madonna bares her soul on every track. Her songwriting is strong here, standout tracks include: the title-track, Til Death Do Us Part, Cherish, Promise to Try, Spanish Eyes, and Oh Father. Love Song is also fresh and entertaining (a deut with Prince). The first time I heard Promise to Try I wept like a baby, so heartbreaking, the song is about her mother's death. Like A Prayer is pure genius, the perfect album to end the decade she entered in as an artist. Of course the best song is Cherish, could this song be any cuter? All hail Madonna!
0060589469|5.0|Very curious and unusual read. I was fascinated by the range of knowledge Pirsig possesses about motorcycles and at the same time about how multidimensional and deep Phaedrus can think.<br /><br />It is a great read, it inspires, more in depth readings and kindles that thirst for more knowledge into deeper sides of it. I definitely am intending to explore the Zen philosophy soon!!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I am hard to please when it comes to Music and I am reluctant to hear new stuff because I am usually dissapointed with the albums I get. This is a great one though. The Arcade Fire Funeral is definitely one the best albums of 2004, and one of my favorites. I also love the fact that I don't have to skip past half the cd to hear one good song.The Arcade Fire are from Canada and before the making of this album several family members of the band died, hence the title 'Funeral' but also the very dark tone of the album. Actually it is kind of inspiring in a kind of dark way.This is one of my favorite albums of the new batch I got. <br />  <br />
B000A5044C|5.0|Hirozaku Koreeda, the genius behind the scripting, direction and production of this moving film serves as a true reflection of the Japanese society. A one so obsessed and occupied with appearances that easily translates into selfish existence. 'Nobody Knows' can be easily understood as 'Nobody Cares'. It is against this cruelty  that gradually withers the innocence of the children, making it almost unbearable to watch.
B000002N3J|5.0|Madonna's collection of ballads, Something to Remember is beautiful and a pure delight! I love her ballads more than her fancy dance songs. All my favorites are here: Live to Tell, This used to be my Playground, Take A Bow, I'll Remember, Rain, Oh Father, Love Don't live here Anymore, Something to Remember, and many more. There are some new songs in this collection: One More Chance, You'll See, and i think the Marvin Gaye classic, I want You. Madonna's voice shines on her ballads, great alto! This is a album worth remembering.
0312995423|2.0|I started off with the Da Vinci Code, then Angels & Demons, then Deception Point, and now I'm finally at Digital Fortress.  Each book seemed to be more ridiculous and unpolished than the last.<br /><br />Honestly, I really enjoyed the Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, even if they are filled with inaccuracies and artistic liberties.  Digital Fortress though, seems so corny and contrived that I'm having a hard time reading it.<br /><br />The main character is a beautiful, intelligent, perfect woman who works as a top code breaker for the NSA.  She reminds me of those characters in Bollywood films who work for high-profile fashion design firms.  She's in a perfect relationship that has some troubles when they each get caught up in their perfect jobs.  Of course, I assume that these troubles will be perfectly resolved by the end of the book, if I ever finish it, that is.  Maybe I'll just move on to another book.
B0000019PA|4.0|I like the sound of the acoustic guitars. I am bored with all my loud cd's, so I wanted something quieter. There is a nice mix of instruments so the songs  all have a different sound.\\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\" is the song I like best on this album. I will say though the voice takes a while to get used to, at first I hated it, but after a while I can not imagine any one else singing these songs.I am going to look into some of the other music they have. There are a lot of interesting song topics on this album, which is what makes it special for me. <br />
0156012197|5.0|For all those people who rated this 1 star. Let's just say that sadly, this book eludes you because it brings forth truth with such clarity that you attempt to hide from it. Preferring to wallow in self-deception and pretentions about your ability to be in control or hide the foolishness of the characters in the book. This is unfortunate, as it is for such readers that this book would proof the most beneficial. For people who are open-minded and courageous, willing to recognise and confront their folly, this book definitely serves as a good reminder and I hope you enjoyed it as much as me.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is an old favorite of mine.  Austen has a knack for writing about relationships.  There is a fine subterranean stream of masked sexuality contrasting with the formal social necessities of her era that create a wonderful tension in her novels.  The director picked up on this element and created a wonderful movie.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice was gorgeously and authentically filmed.  The period was pre-regency--in the early Napoleonic wars--one not so commonly portrayed. The men pose in outfits that evoke some of the portraits of Napoleon.  All of the locations are stunning making the most of ancient trees and beautiful mansions.<br /><br />The film portrayed the ramifications of what it meant to be the daughters of poor gentry in this era.  The girls simply must marry in order to survive.  Yet they were looked down upon for their aspirations to marry well.  Also, their lower social status made them prey to men who might exploit these women for sex.  In most cases marriages were simply financial transactions--merging of assets.<br /><br />Matt McFayden was the perfect choice to play the proud man who is humbled by his love for a woman impossible for him to marry because she is not in his social class.  When he decides that his love for her is so great he cannot be without her, his pride and a series of misunderstandings cause Lizzy (Keira Knightly) to reject him. McFayden and Knightly play the star-crossed lovers with the restrained intensity called for by the social manners of the time. In particular McFayden is devastating as the heart-broken lover.<br /><br />This movie succeeded visually, as a psychological portrait of a social era and most importantly as a great romance.
1416524800|3.0|Like many other people, I decided to read Deception Point after enjoying Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code, but I was kind of disappointed.<br /><br />The presentation of the Da Vinci code made the plot somewhat believable, even if it is inaccurate.  Deception Point, on the other hand, has several, crazy action scenes that are comparable to the big finale in Angels and Demons.  Several parts of the book are so crazy that you have to ask, \\"Why would that even happen in the first place?\\" or \\"How could anyone possibly do that?\\"<br /><br />Despite the implausible action, it is a pretty exciting book.  I read it over the course of a week (I read Da Vinci Code in two days), and found it to be pretty enjoyable.  It's not as complicated as the Da Vinci Code, but it's still a page turner.  Just don't expect another Da Vinci Code and you'll probably enjoy Deception Point.<br /><br />This reprint is taller than the regular paperback books that I have, but about the same size in depth.  It makes it feel kind of awkard to open at first, but it's not really a problem after you wear it in a bit.  Just a warning if you're obsessive about having all of your books line up in the bookshelf.
0684808323|5.0|Perhaps a little more well known for \\"Wiseguys\\", the book that became the movie \\"Goodfellas\\", Nicholas Pileggi is as good as they get when it comes to writing about the Mafia, its people and the drama of living the life.  It is unfortunate that he doesn't work very fast - more books would be welcome.<br /><br />  \\"Casino\\" is the true story of Vegas in its heyday prior to the mega resort/casinos we see today, like Excalibur, New York New York, The Luxor, etc.  Before large corporations turned Las Vegas into a theme park with casinos, the Chicago mob pretty much controlled the then famous casinos of the day, like the Stardust, where the movie \\"Casino\\" disguises it with the fictional name of The Tangier.  Skimming the profits was the mob's business.  Perhaps the greatest handicapper of all time, Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal, ran three major casinos and ran them well.  Chicago sent out the legendary Tony Spilotro to keep an eye on \\"Lefty\\" and protect him and the moolah.  Spilotro, however, had ideas of his own and soon became mired in a horrendous mess, dragging Rosenthal and eventually all the mob controlled casinos to their demise with him.  Rosenthal still lives, and even has a web site, but Spilotro at books' end learns the hard way that being insubordinate to the mob and skimming their skim has dire consequences.<br /><br />  Pileggi is a master at showing a picture of the lives of these people, the shady deals, the threats from every corner, from the state, other criminals and the Mob, and how difficult life is for those who choose the gambling scene as a way of life.<br /><br />  It's morbid but fascinating reading.  A must for fans of organized crime books.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|in order to appreciate this album, you're gonna need a couple of things. you're gonna need really good (or state of the art) head phones and alot of patience. if you don't have either, you're gonna miss out on alot of really great stuff. there's alot going on in this album. there's alot going in each song. you can thank fruisciante for most of the melodic layers of sound. this guy finds more ways to treat his guitar and pulls more melodies out of his hat than... most other mofos. this gives this album an experimental edge without settling on making a bunch of avant garde noise. anthony's voice is just plain amazing. he's so fluid now. it's almost flawless. he experiments with his vocals here and there, but nothing sounds really distorted or strange. his rap delivery and screaming are also in really great shape. he shows some pretty great diversity with his lyrics as well. the words range from funky nonsense to deep marriage vows. flea's bass is back in action after disappearing on By The Way. chad smith's drumming is just plain great. throw in a wide range of musical styles, experiments with dynamics, a few keyboards, some additional percussion, a female background vocal here and there, some kick arrrse guest stars like billy preston and you have this amazing album. i can't even begin to fathom what their next album will sound like...
B000EULJLU|1.0|I'm not a big fan of Tool, but I know that Optiate, Undertow and Aenima are great albums, however Lateralus was a terribly boring album, incredubly dissapointing and predictable and lacking any real life.....this album though is a smashing disgrace, the songs sound like they are thrown together crap, not arrangments, no melody tune, structure let alone feeling or emtotion plain boring and dull. No wonder, just like Lateralus they needed to include overe the top eccentric artwork to compensate for the crap they are putting out under their name these days \\"TOOL\\" - the deep phyllosophical mysterious band that was been, a bunch of old 40 year olds trying to be worth it. <br /> <br />Well they are not, back in 1997, they were the biggest thing since sliced bread, but they were actually good then. Which is why Aenima was one of the biggest selling album of the 90s. <br /> <br />Any artist that includes goggles on their cd cover to look at artwork had to be faking it, I thought it was about the music anyway.
B00000J7JO|5.0|this album is worthy of the praise it gets. it's a great album. the funk is strong, the rock is heavy, the lyrics are emotional, the singing is beautiful, the band is tight yet raw, the songwriting is really good overall. the lyrical content is the only questionable thing about this album. there aren't many curses, but the lyrics tend to be graphic. just a warning. oh yeah, the singles had cool videos too. enjoy.
1590581814|5.0|The master turns the juice up one more notch in this new favorite Sallis of mine.  Start to finish magic.  Drive(r) takes you on a ride that is a pure adrenaline rush with what is the most consistently best prose in the genre.  I ordered this with Cripple Creek (a 4 *starred* review Sallis Masterpiece) and couldn't put either down.  This guy is simply the best there is.
B000067CPX|5.0|this was the album that introduced me to RHCP a few years ago. there are alot of really great songs on this album. the singles were/are all great. the title track is pretty awesome. it's one part melody and one part freaky, heavy funk... just like the band! had a really cool video too. The Zephyr Song is melodic and hypnotic. the video was really mesmerising. Can't Stop is grade A chili pepper funk/punk/meldoic stuff. the video's funny. Dosed is a beautiful song. it's an ode to love, as we all know. nice guitars, nice singing. it got some decent airplay. Universally Speaking is a real highlight of the album with a motown beat, beatles harmonies, a touch of george harrison-esque guitar, great lyrics, and soulful lead vocals. this was a single in europe. Tear is the albums biggest surprise (i agree with the professional review). it reminds me of The Beatles' song Let it Be, but the chorus is gorgeous and has lovely Beach Boys style harmonies. I Could Die For You and Midnight are two beautiful, yet underrated tracks. i was never crazy about Throw Away Your Television despite its funkyness and message. Cabron, On Mercury, and Minor Thing are all nice, but they seem like filler. Warm Tape is really cool. the \\"shiver for me girl\\" line is HOT. Venice Queen is the big finale. it's a very impressive track overall. <br /> <br />if you want some great RHCP albums, get this, Californication, BSSM, and their latest Stadium Arcadium. you'll be surprised.
0312199066|5.0|This book is so exciting and interesting to read that you'll finish this in a heartbeat. Once finished you wish there was more to read. The style of this book is really nice and draws you in like no other book. If you enjoy the Apollo era then this book must be on your list to read.
0385720920|3.0|I dunno why I suddenly have the impulse to write a review for this as it was quite a while ago that I read it, but I won't fight it.  In short, this isn't a very good novel and is probably Palahniuk's weakest book.  (It's a tough call between this and the also kinda mediocre 'Lullaby'.  I like all his other stuff a lot, though.)  In summing it all up, you could say that this is the Palahniuk where all the bad things that his critics say about him are actually true.  Its got its good aspects too, but not enough of 'em.<br /><br />Now, Chuck Palahniuk has never been known for his focus and tight plotting and whatnot, but this book just goes nowhere at all.  This wouldn't matter much, except the characters aren't interesting enough to make it terribly worthwhile.  Victor is a less likable, somewhat dull protagonist, definitely the dullest main character in any of Palahniuk's novels.  All his protagonist's have a distinct, interesting voice, and while Mancini does have a distinct voice, I suppose, he's not terribly interesting, and actually rather irritating.  Even worse is the second most significant character, Denny.  I seem to remember reading somewhere that Denny is Palahniuk's favorite character that he's written, which is funny cause I hate the guy, violently and personally.  He's just such a freaking idiot, and I assume this is supposed to make him endearing, but it doesn't work at all for me.<br /><br />Now, the book does have a plot of sorts, involving Victor's childhood and his unknown father and a 'nurse' he's attracted to who works at the resthome where his mother is and so on.  None of this is particularly interesting, or even takes up all that much of the novel.  Of course, I still enjoy Palahniuk's writing style, and some of the individual episodes of the novel are funny or amusing, but it's also surprisingly uninvolving and tiresome at times.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  As a Palahniuk fan I'd still recommend reading this, mainly cause I just insist in trying to get into everything by an artist or entertainer that I like if it's at all feasible.  But don't be expecting too much, and I don't anticipate having any terrible desire to read this again any time soon, excepting maybe I find myself wondering, 'Well, maybe 'Choke' was better than you thought, maybe you should check....'  But that would be an impulse based in experimentation, not fondness.rything by an artist or entertainer that I like if it's at all feasible.

B00005JOTV|1.0|Ashley (Lohan) appears to be some type of admin asst at a publicity firm.  She lives in a luxurious apartment and wears designer clothes on her paltry salary (her two friends in the same job share a much dinkier apartment and have much less money, apparently). Anyway, she gets promoted and everything always goes her way even though she doesn't have much common sense. Jake, on the other hand, is a loser, also without much common sense. Jake sneaks into a party that Ashley is in charge of where everyone is wearing a mask (except Ashley - she wears some netty thing).  They dance and kiss. Their \\"luck\\" is switched. (What happened to all the other guys she kissed? Hey, maybe she stole one of those guys' luck!) Ashley goes to jail and gets punched out. She gets fired.  Her apt is flooded. She moves in with her friends and drops her contact lens in the litter box. She immediately puts it back in her eye. When her friends express concern, she says \\"Hey, it's my last one!\\" She must be out of contact lens solution also!! She gets an eye infection which lasts one day. Ashley also displays her vast stupidity when her blowdryer shorts out: she throws it in the tub and runs water on it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, everything's going Jake's way and he no longer even needs to wear eyeglasses anymore (when they switch luck again he goes back to wearing them). The band he's managing gets a record  contract.  He gets a gorgeous apartment and a limo.<br /><br />Ashley's friends assist her in trying to find the mysterious kisser who stole her luck. Finally she finds him and all ends well.  Is this a Disney movie? It really wasn't good.

038572179X|3.0|Atonement, a novel by Ian McEwen, reaches into the mind of a highly imaginative and spoiled rich girl named Briony.  It tells a tale wrought with betrayal, strife, and war; examining the aesthetic and egotisticaly driven motives of the young Briony as she attempts to atone for the destruction of her sisters life.  Upon the original release, the novel gained momentum as rave after rave review illuminated this literary gem, each one declaring the novel to be some master piece of British literature, second to none.  Unfortunately it was not so for this reader.   <br />       The plot boasts a backgound narrative voice of appalingly monotonous, and opaque prose that prolongs a thin and soap-operaesque storyline that, when reviewed, appears miniscule in relation to the quagmire of language used.  Contrary to many other reviews, this reader found it almost impossible to pick back up, and begin another bout of derisory and headachey leterary torture.  One finds oneself wading through a thick mire of arbitrary adjectives and greatly uneccessary details.  The novel baites the reader with a developing storyline that appears as if to be resolving, creating one of the only seeable motivations in reading it, but all hope is dashed when the book staggers to a highly anticlimactic fruition; there is no real atonement, no real apology, and the end leaves the reader in awe of the unprecedented amount of time that they have invested.   <br />         The book commences in the British countryside at the wealthy household of the Tallis'.  It opens with Briony, a young imaginative and mature girl, wating for three cousins from the far north to act in her play entitled \\"The Trials of Arabella\\".  During the night of production Briony intercepts a disturbing note from the charlady's son Robbie Turner addressed to her beloved sister Cecilia.  Briony feels confusion, and she then proceeds to walk in as Cecilia and Robbie express their feelings for the first time.  With the spotlight no longer on her, Briony broods about the recent developments and not until later that same evening does she have a chance for revenge.  On a night searchparty enacted to find two of the cousins, Briony's cousin Lola is set upon and raped, Briony appears as the figure of a man disperses into the woods.  In her state of begrudging from the previous happenstances, Briony comes forth and swears that Robbie had raped her cousin.  This sends Robbie to jail and her sister into isolation from the rest of the family.  The story illustrates Briony's quest for forgiveness and atonement with the two people who she destroyed with her spoiled and egotistical alligations.   <br />      It is felt by this reader that if, in some strange and masochistic way, one feels the need to wade through a wasteland of gelatinous and cantankerous language, then take this readers advice and do so, you will not be disapointed.
0393035158|3.0|For the most part, I enjoyed this book.  It is rare to see the atheist case laid out so clearly and compellingly--those of us who were either raised atheist or have lost our faith often see little reason to proselytize.  Whether others believe or not, God is still not there.  However, this book does, as the title suggests, point out the dangers of this lax attitude. <br /> <br />I ultimately abandoned this book, however, because the final chapter abandons its own thesis of attacking faith and instead endorses Buddhism, claiming that (a) Buddhism isn't really a religion like other religions are religions, (b) most Buddhists aren't practicing the really real Buddhism that only the author seems to know about, and (c) crazy mystical claims made by Buddhists about the supernatural are entirely different from crazy mystical claims made by Jews, Christians, and Muslims about the supernatural.  It was disappointing enough that I decided not to finish the book, and continue the search for a really decent atheist text.

B000AADYRQ|5.0|I've read so many reviews of this albumn and I don't care if Death Cab sold out...why care if the music and lyrics are still brilliant.  Maybe it's that teenagers haven't lived life and can't relate to Plans.   <br /> <br />I don't care what they think, but if you have lived life listen to \\"What Sarah Said\\"...read the lyrics and listen to it loud.  Then listen to it again with your eyes closed.  Use your brain and think about what Gibbard wrote in this song. Listen to \\"Your Heart is an Empty Room\\", \\"We Looked like Giants\\", \\"I Will Follow You into the Dark\\" the same way. I love the last 3 albums too and I think this the best.

All genres (besides big band and opera :-P) are depicted in this album. This has to be up there with Physical Grafitti as one of the best albums ever. I really have no idea where these one star reviews come from,,
0802130208|5.0|I have been disappointed in the past by great comic novels.  This time, I laughed out loud on the subway to and from work at scenes of bewitching absurdity.  Ignatius has a way with words that is sharply at odds with his position in the world. If you can't laigh at the hot dog vendor who eats his own profits well then, I feel sorry for you!<br /><br />The adventures are silly, and delightfully so.  I think a person who doesn't get this book is taking Life too, too seriouslY!  Lighten up and enjoy the racous New Orleans nightlife, the mad stereotypes.  Irene, Lana and co. are just flights of fancy that will divert you from reality.
B00004VYAP|5.0|This griity and grim mob flick, deftly directed by Mike Newell, is based upon the true story of FBI undercover, Joe Pistone, who. as his alter ego \\"Donnie Brasco\\", infiltrated the mob for a number of years, resulting in its eventual decimation. So artfully did the real Joe Pistone infiltrate and so well did he do his job, that he and his family were obliged to enter the witness protection program for their safety, as a contract was ultimately put out on Joe Pistone's life.<br /><br />Here, Johnny Depp, plays the role of Joe Pistone/Donnie Brasco. He is terrific in the role, and the viewer watches him become absorbed by the lifestyle of the mobsters with whom he associates. He is befriended by \\"Lefty\\" Ruggierro, artfully played Al Pacino. Shifty and common, \\"Lefty\\" typifies your low level made guy, the guy on the fringes doing the dirty work, a real bottom feeder. He is the guy who does the hits, and he is the guy the higher ups look to whack when something goes wrong. It is not an enviable or glamourous life, as has been made out by other films, such as the \\"Godfather\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\". The existence of \\"Lefty\\" and the legions like him is gritty and grim, always a bridesmaid and never a bride.<br /><br />\\"Lefty\\" takes Brasco under his wing and vouches for him. He shows Brasco the ABCs of becoming a \\"made\\" guy. \\"Lefty\\" himself wants to move up in the mob hierarchy. It soon becomes painfully obvious that that ain't gonna happen. One cannot help feel a little sorry for \\"Lefty\\", so limited is his world view and so at the mercy of others. Still, \\"Lefty\\" gives Donnie some invaluable lessons on mob etiquette. He also unburdens himself to Donnie, treating him as if he were his adopted son. The bond between the two men grows. As this happens, Donnie finds himself being pulled more and more into the world of mobsters, until his old and new reality begin to merge.<br /><br />As he distances himself drom his wife (Anne Heche) and family, Brasco is thrust into a maelstrom of mob violence that threatens to tear him apart and consume him. He tries to get \\"Lefty\\" to go straight and retire, in hope of avoiding his betrayal. It is to no avail. Brasco, in for a penny, in for a pound, now stands to become a \\"made\\" guy himself. It is only at the eleventh hour that an intervention set up by the FBI plays itself out, setting up the betrayal of \\"Lefty\\". It is a sad moment for Brasco, as he knows that \\"Lefty\\" has just been handed a death sentence at the hands of the mob for vouching for an FBI agent. It is Brasco's ultimate salvation, however, as he was on the brink of committing an unpardonable act, one in which he would have crossed the line and from which there would have been no turning back. It is a decision that was, luckily for him, taken out of his hands.<br /><br />Al Pacino gives the defining, superlative performance in this film. Anne Heche is sensational as the put upon, concerned wife, who watches her husband change into someone she can barely recognize. Johnny Depp, likewise, gives a stellar performance as the angst ridden FBI undercover agent. All in all, a terrific film with a stellar cast and well worth having in one's collection.violence that threatens to tear him apart and consume him.

0380713802|4.0|I definitely liked this sarcastic but warm book about solitary travels thru Europe, interlaced with fragments of a journey taken years earlier with a certain weirdo named Katz.<br /><br />The glimpses into European culture are just great- how movie tickets are sold here, how food is served with attitude there.  Also, there is great comedy in the scenes of being an odd duck in places like Lichtenstein and MIlan, but also rewarding beauty in Capri and Paris.<br /><br />I wish two things:  that there had been more about Katz, who is one of the most misanthropic figures I have come across in a while and that generally makes for good comedy; also, that the last three chapters hadn't felt quite so tired. I suspect that that is just a realistic impression of how the author did feel towards the end of his journey  but it was anti-climactic.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This is a very emotional film.  It infuriated me, to see how the Germans treated the Jews.  The most visible villain in the film is the commander of a concentration camp, and he is pictured here as an insane psychopath in certain scenes, notably the one in which he accuses a Jewish girl of being to blame for his attraction to her, playing the scene with enough irrationality to place him in the Bates Motel in Psycho.  I wouldn't have made that choice.  I think the Germans knew reality from fantasy and were not clinically insane.  They were just cold hearted and evil.<br /><br />Oscar Schindler himself is pictured, by the end of the film, as a saint, tormented because he didn't sell his car in order to save ten more Jews.  I don't know if that was overdone or not, but I gratefully applaud Oscar Schindler for being one of the very few kind people in Europe at that time.<br /><br />There have been many other genocides in recent history.  They seem to occur on a fairly regular basis in Africa these days.<br /><br />There were many crimes against humanity during World War Two.  The Japanese were right up there with the Germans.  The Japanese murdered six million innocent Chinese civilians and sent their army to rape and murder Chinese civilians everywhere they went.  They committed unspeakable war crimes, like tossing Chinese babies in the air and catching them on their bayonets in front of the parents.  It seems as if Satan himself walked the Earth during World War Two and ruled both Germany and Japan.  Japan was well on its way towards detonating an atom bomb over San Francisco, so it was fortunate that they were forced to surrender shortly before their own A-bomb was ready for delivery.<br /><br />There was some unfinished business at the end of this film.  It left me wondering what happened to two people after the war - Oscar Schindler and Helen Hirsch, the woman who was tormented by the insane Nazi concentration camp commander.  You must watch some of the extras to get updated on that.  Oscar Schindler lived out his life without any wealth, helped by some of the grateful Jews he saved.  He left his wife.  As for Helen Hirsch, we actually get to see her place a stone on the grave of Oscar Schindler.  She lived to a ripe old age.  But the interest that she built in the movie was just left hanging at the end of the movie.<br /><br />This is a painful movie to watch, but it is well done.  Jew-hatred is very popular all over the world today, and of course in Germany, and the young Germans barely know a thing about the crimes against God and humanity that their grandparents committed and applauded.  This movie really needs to be shown to everyone in Germany.<br /><br />Every time I see a Beck's Beer commercial, or a Mercedes Benz or other German car commercial, and I see the Germans once again playing Master Race and telling us that their product is superior because it was made by Germans, I am left to realize that the German people learned absolutely nothing from the Holocaust or the war.  Cars made in other countries don't brag about the race of the people who engineered the cars.  You don't hear Toyota proudly exclaiming it is the product of Japanese engineering, and you don't hear Cadillac bragging that it is the product of American engineering.  I don't understand why the German people are so race conscious and why they are so particularly proud and superior.  I see no reason for that superiority complex.  If anything, I'd think they would be ashamed to be German, not still crowing about it.ras to get updated on that.

0894808532|5.0|This book is just too funny!  A diverse collection of odd characters, witty dialog and narration, hilarious footnotes, and the end of the world, all in one package!  I've re-read it several times over the last 13 years, and it still makes me laugh out loud -- now that's a funny book! <br /> <br />I've seen comparison of this novel to \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\", but I'd advise judging the book on it's own merits.  I've read other works by Gaiman and Pratchett (independent of each other), and while I can see the elements of both authors in \\"Good Omens\\", the two seem to blend so well that this book even seems somewhat different from the authors' independent works.  I haven't found anything truly similar to \\"Good Omens\\" yet -- at least not in the department of repeat laugh-out-loud readability!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I haven't seen Firefly...yet, but you can watch this movie without it and still enjoy it.  Serenity has some really strong, and well developed characters.  It's great when you can see a film with actors and actresses who aren't well known, but can pull the job off as well as any big name hollywood cast member could.  It would be great to see a second Serenity film, but even if a follow up is never made, it's still a great film that stands on it's own merits and then some. <br /> <br />The humor and weird slang are simply outstanding subtleties that really make this film special. <br /> <br />I'll likely view the Firefly show in the near future as a result of how great this film was-which a very, very pleasant surprise for a change.
B000006TRV|4.0|I have a theory that Pink Floyd are good (actually brilliant, great) for 40-45 minutes. Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here are perfect albums (in my opinion) and clock in at 42.8 and 44.4 minutes respectively. Meddle clocks in at approx 47m but when you get rid of the two songs that don't fit and shouldn't be there (San Tropez and Seamus) you get a mighty fine album of 40.7 minutes. <br /> <br />So, to The Wall. A double album, a concept album, dark and depressing overall. The double CD sat in my CD rack for years barely listened to. I tried to listen to it all the way through but it was hard, so hard. Was this the same group that had blown me away in my school days with DSOTM and WYWH?  <br /> <br />The key that unlocked the greatness for me was the live Pulse album sans Roger Waters. Illogical perhaps, but a wonderful distillation of the Wall into the killer tracks Another Brick in the Wall part 2, Hey You, Run Like Hell and Comfortably Numb. To me, therefore, the key to accessing and enjoying the Wall is to free the brilliant from the dross. To find the brilliant 40-45 minute album lost inside. <br /> <br />So, if you can't get into the Wall at all, can't muster more than 2 or 3 stars, then burn a new CD or load it in to your I-Tunes and create another brilliant album / playlist of  43.6 minutes: <br /> <br />1. In the Flesh? <br />2. Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1) <br />3. Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) <br />4. Mother <br />5. Young Lust <br />6. Hey You <br />7. Is There Anybody Out There? <br />8. Comfortably Numb <br />9. The Show Must Go On <br />10. In the Flesh <br />11. Run Like Hell <br /> <br />The Floyd purists will no doubt shout heresy, and that the concept story is torn apart. But if you don't care too much for the depressing story of Pink and just want to hear some amazing rock music, then give The Wall Lite, or the Small Wall, or whatever you want to call the abbreviated version above, a listen. You may occasionally go back forthe whole story just for interest, but you won't get tired of listening to these 11 tracks. <br /> <br />My star rating is 4 for the double CD as is, 5 for my Lite version. <br /> <br />PS. I've just bought Animals, Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell .... Gotta see if my Pink Floyd Theory holds true for those .... <br />
B000F1IQN2|4.0|I won't go into the plot since other reviews already describe it accurately, but this movie is emotionally draining in the same tone as Saving Private Ryan.  Eric Bana's best work.  Despite it not winning any of the Oscars it was nominated for, it was definitely a worthy contender for Best Picture.   <br /> <br />This film gives a very insightful look into the Palestinian/Israeli conflict from the level of the people involved, without the news angle.  <br /> <br />Not to be missed.
1400079179|1.0|This book is very well written. Very interesting and very entertaining. I have no doubt that Brown is bound to be a talented author HOWEVER saying that in all fairness I must add that it is the most deceitful work of ficton I have ever read.  It takes all that Catholics and Christians hold as dear and tranples it underfoot and in my opinon makes fun of it.  True it is marked fiction but its written like it is true and has a lot of people confused.  Jesus DID NOT marry Mary Magdalene and have a daughter. There are not a group of monks hiding this \\"secret\\" and Jesus IS really God in the flesh. If you say this book's claim to Christ is true you deny that we have any hope to eternal life and all humantiy's hope is forever lost.  Brown has taken everything Christians believe as truth and trampled it underfoot like a hogg trampling on our jewels and wallowing in the slop that he is making off this garbage.  If such a book as this is written about Jesus the Christ..and nobody who is a Christian finds it offensive then why not write equally scandle books about other great men in history? Why just pick on God's Son? I had no problem with Harry Potter, Broback Mountain or most books & films some Christians are offended by but this is where I draw the line!  Don't be conned by Dan....If you must read this REMEMBER its ALL fiction and not true!
B00000AFGM|5.0|Why this album didn't sell better than it did is beyond me.  This is by far my favorite Marilyn Manson album.  The songs are diverse, polished, and catchy while still retaining Manson's normal darkness and heavy riffs.  'The Dope Show' blew up on radio, and \\"I Don't Like the Drugs but the Drugs Like Me\\" is one of those songs that only Manson could have made work.  \\"Rock is Dead\\" should please his old fans, and his softer songs like \\"spped of Pain\\" and \\"Coma White\\" are every bit as good as the others.  I know Manson doesn't make a fraction of the publicity he used to, but hopefully that won't make people forget how unique and special and artist he really is.  I'd recommend this album to anyone.

078681859X|5.0|At the tender age of six years, Nathaniel is taken from his parents and apprenticed as a learning magician to Arthur Underwood, a minor functionary in a dark and fantastical English government. This bleak London's parliamentarians and upper crust are members of a greedy, self-serving ruling class of magicians and everyone else is disparagingly referred to as a \\"commoner\\". When Nathaniel encounters Simon Lovelace, a brutal, ruthless magician whose ambition knows no limits, Lovelace chooses to openly display his terrifying power and publicly humiliates Nathaniel while Underwood stands meekly by doing nothing to defend his young charge who has barely begun to learn the rudiments of his magical craft. Angered beyond endurance, Nathaniel decides to secretly accelerate his own learning and begins to plot his revenge against Lovelace.<br /><br />When he quietly masters one of the most difficult spells in a magician's repertoire, Nathaniel summons Bartimaeus, an ancient djinni (with a rather acerbic wit and a very dry sense of humour), and commands him to steal Lovelace's greatest treasure, The Amulet of Samarkand. Unaware that Lovelace was planning on putting the amulet to use in a treasonous coup to overthrow the government, Nathaniel finds himself trapped in a maelstrom of evil, espionage, murder and magical Royal Rumbles and is now pursued as the object of a merciless manhunt.<br /><br />Much more than a mere Harry Potter wannabe knock-off, The Amulet of Samarkand treats us not only to a blazing quick page turner but also throws in a generous helping of more adult issues such as questioning the morality of class distinctions; the development of a resistance movement to a dictatorial government clearly interested in nothing more than the perpetuation of its own comfort and rule; and power lust, greed or altruism as motives for action.<br /><br />Stroud's use of footnotes, far from being distracting is actually quite infectious. Bartimaeus, in the manner of a quietly comic George Burns, well aware of his own comedic skills, steps out of character and out of the story in the footnotes, to offer his own sotto voce observations and asides directly to the reading audience. Judiciously sprinkled throughout the novel, Stroud has kept their number and length at exactly the right level to ensure the high-speed plot is not dampened.<br /><br />The happy ending of the story is not only wonderfully satisfying but open-ended enough that we know (nay, we hope) there is more to come! A couple of the mean dudes have simply vanished into hiding (you don't suppose they'll be back, do you?). Bartimaeus has been dismissed in a cloud of misty smoke and brimstone to his own spirit world and Nathaniel clearly begins to struggle with much more adult ideas of what must be done with his new found reputation, position and rapidly advancing skills and powers.<br /><br />The Amulet of Samarkand is a delicious, fast-paced lightweight reading confection that can be recommended to readers of all ages.

B000EMGAOY|4.0|First off, the chili peppers are the greatest punk rock band on the earth and i dont know how the heck they became so beautifully melodic. I like punk but punk isnt usually considered as beautiful, however chili peppers have changed that concept completely. <br /> Now im not saying i dont like some tracks on this album, i have tried lisening to them loads of times but i just can't see their greatness. My least favourite tracks are: <br />1. Warlocks <br />2. C'mon Girl <br />3. So Much I <br />4. Storm in a Teacup <br />5. We Believe <br /> Just because i dont like these tracks doesnt mean i dont like this album. Infact completely the opposite, i have liked the chilis since blood sugars release when i was 14. It's just that i feel that what made them was johns solos and they seem to be thinning slightly. <br /> Notice that on the great tracks of the album that there is a solo in everyone. My favourite tracks are: <br />1. Dani California <br />2. Snow (Hey Oh) <br />3. Charlie <br />4. Stadium Arcadium <br />5. Slow Cheetah <br />6. Torture Me (my current favourite) <br />7.

B000A896J8|1.0|I should send Orlando Bloom a bill for the cost of this film and the time I spent watching it. The dialoge is uber-cheesy and the plot line very difficult to coherently comprehend. Don't waste your time on this film.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Fasten your seatbelt and leave the popcorn in the cupboard, this movie moves through your senses like a runaway freight train. The cinematography and musical score act like a claw hammer pounding away at your psyche bringing you into the lives of ordinary people caught up in the \\"American Dream,\\" the dream that leaves so many behind without hope, without love, without faith. Brutally frank in its depiction of taking the shortcut to our dreams, it depicts addiction, both legal and illegal, and its short and long term effects. The final prenatal position scenes wrench your guts out and leave you knowing that you have witnessed cinema at its finest.
B0006HXXBA|4.0|After the stunning return to form in 2001's \\"Violent Revolution\\", I was eagerly anticipating this latest Kreator record and by and large it does the job if in a bit less effective manner. \\"Enemy Of God\\" starts off very much in the vein of their last record with the scorching title track building a head of steam that is quickly followed by a succession of solid mid-paced thrash numbers that highlight Kreator's ability to write some of the best thrash grooves in the business. <br /> <br />Nothing here is mind blowing or even that different from their previous work but it's executed perfectly and sounds just different enough to keep you interested. A big part of that different sound is a new melodic undercurrent that gives a nod to some of the newer metal bands. There's a lot more dual lead guitar riffs worked into the songs as opposed to just blazing fast solos. <br /> <br />Besides a new emphasis on more melodic passages, the other big difference between this material and their older work is the speed. The songs here never achieve the vicious pace of classic albums like \\"Extreme Aggression\\" or \\"Coma Of Souls\\" but you can hear hints of similar riffs in many places, just not quite as fast. To purists this may be enough to give a pass on this album but it would be shame to dismiss this album just because it's not as fast as stuff they wrote fifteen years ago. <br /> <br />\\"Enemy Of God\\" is definitely a worthy addition to the Kreator catalog, especially in light of some of the junk they were putting out in the late nineties, but it's not quite as good as \\"Violent Revolution\\". Even though the songs here are dealt from the same deck stylistically, I can't help but get the feeling \\"Violent Revolution\\" has the better hand in the form of faster, more traditional Kreator fare. That disc is pretty much solid from start to finish whereas \\"Enemy Of God\\" has relies a bit too much on melody versus the straight out thrash Kreator is famous for delivering in spades. <br /> <br />Check out more reviews at ohboydestroy.
0553260111|4.0|I was propelled to read this book after watching the movie- and I decided to read the first of three Bourne books.  It took four days to read this book during a family vacation.  Needless to say, the book was hard to put down.  The story is captivating, slowly (although sometimes too slowly) revealing to the reader the twists and turns in the plot.  The main character is a fascinating character, slowly coming to life in the book through his own self-realization.  This was an interesting way to reveal a main character.  Though the character and his circumstances are seemingly beyond the realm of possibility, the plot of the book is amazing, tying everything together resulting in pleasurable reading.<br /><br />On a negative note- at times the book goes slow for my taste.  The strength of this book is not in the author's writing style, but in his ability to tell a suspenseful story.  At times the book tries to get too cute and too clever concerning the writing.  This author will never win any Pulitzers, and I don't believe he should even try.  Also, I realize that there probably needs to be a girl for the main character- but why does she and her interaction with the main character have to be both boring and unbelievable?  Outside of these things the book was thoroughly enjoyable.  I plan on reading the two following installments in the Bourne series.  In a closing note, the movie is good- but hardly resembles the book.  I think it would be too difficult to make a good movie by sticking closely to the book, but I was a little bit disappointed that there were few resemblances.
B000F1IQMS|4.0|I think movies that delve into modern history to remind us what has happened and why events such as these shouldn't ever be lost to memory have to be my favorite. Munich is this type of film. Though named for the events that happened in 1972 Olympic Games, Munich follows not only what happened to the Israeli athletes but the reciprocation as well. Essentially, it turns into one man's story to fight for a country he believes in as a Jew and an Israeli, yet finds himself horrified by what he and his comrades have done and what they had done to them.<br /><br />What hit me immediately about this film was the attempt Steven Spielberg made to try and keep his film culturally neutral. Though I think he failed, he did make an effort, which I have to appreciate as someone who has very little tolerance for racism. Movies such as this can create a stir, especially when they are as successful as Munich was, and creating a deeper sense of hatred between the two opposing cultures in this movie is something that definitely would have ruined the experience for me. So, though at times he slipped a little, Steven Spielberg did a great job at putting a human in all the roles, and not making monsters out of a culture we don't understand.<br /><br />That leads me to the film itself, which was done to perfection. Steven Spielberg still is the greatest director out there, and shows that yet again with Munich. This is one tense film, starting early and only occasionally giving us breathers. Spielberg also did a lot to make the characters likable, despite the fact that they were political assassins. This movie plays out in stages, starting of course with the actual taking of the hostages in Munich, moving into the political battles of how best to get revenge for the massacre, and finally the undertaking of that revenge. The first two steps pass by rather quickly, and the action and suspense take over in the third step. Here is where the story of Avner begins to unfold, as he leads a group of five assassins--including Avner--who are charged by Golda Mier, the Israeli Prime Minister, to take out the eleven Palestinians who planned the Munich massacre. But as the group begins killing, and they become more and more accustomed to it, things begin to turn bad. Avner must find a way to deal with the hardships of being a family man and an assassin, while also keeping his team together.<br /><br />Though I didn't give this a perfect rating, I still highly recommend this movie to everyone. Steven Spielberg takes his liberties, but all directors do in the end, and this movie never really attempts to be completely truthful. What it does attempt is a possible explanation of closely guarded historical events. And even if you aren't interested in learning, this is still a great action movie filled with lots of suspense.oup of five assassins--including Avner--who are charged by Golda Mier, the Israeli Prime Minister, to take out the eleven Palestinians who planned the Munich massacre.

1558908846|3.0|Look, I won't mince words. When compiling my annual list of summer box-office predictions (which I boast a 92% accuracy rate over a 17 year period - HOLLA!), I made a error when I predicted \\"Judge Dredd\\" as #9 with a 92 million gross.  Oops.  It finished with just under 35 million at the box office, even factoring in a 78 million dollar foreign take this was a disappointment for a 90 million dollar budget!   <br /> <br />So what happened?  The movie is reasonably exciting and well acted.  Rob Schneider manages to pretty much steal the whole darn thing with his comic relief - he gets off quite a few funny one-liners.  The special effects are fairly thrilling.  But when all was said and done, there just weren't any stand-out elements in this movie to make it truly memorable.  Too bad Stallone didn't write (or at least co-write) the screenplay, but no surprise because this was during the mid-90s when he wasn't contributing much more than star power to his films (and \\"power\\" is used rather loosely at that point in his career). <br /> <br />In the end, this is a good sci-fi action movie and fun for pretty much the whole family (under 8 year olds might be a bit frightened at times).  I'm not a parent (and time is running out, sadly), but if I was I wouldn't hesitate to sit them down in front of the tube to watch this movie with a bag of Newman's Own cookies.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|Gilmour proves that he doesn't need his bandmates to produce a fantastic album yet again with \\"On An Island\\". This album sounds like a new Floyd album. David Gilmour, unmoving to the current trends, instead sticks with the sound of classic Pink Floyd albums, enhancing them with his tremendous abilities on the guitar, piano, sax, vocals, etc. Gilmour shows with this album that despite the general credit going to Roger Waters, Gilmour was just as much the genius behind Pink Floyd as Roger Waters was. Though Pink Floyd may be gone, Gilmour has released his first solo album in 18 years and it certainly holds up to old Pink Floyd albums while holding up to Gilmour's previous solo works as well. <br /> <br />1. \\"Castellorizon\\" - Awesome guitar solo instrumental track along with a lot of orchestral arrangements involved with it. David Gilmour proves even in 2006 he can play the guitar just as well as in 1976. *****/***** <br /> <br />2. \\"On An Island\\" - Gilmour's guitar ability really stands out on it and it sounds really good. I'd place the guitar parts along the lines of A Momentary Lapse Of Reason and the vocal parts around Meddle. *****/***** <br /> <br />3. \\"The Blue\\" - Very Meddle sounding song and reminds me somewhat of \\"Fat Old Sun\\" from Atom Heart Mother. ****/***** <br /> <br />4. \\"Take A Breath\\" - Definitely place this with The Wall. It has similar arrangements to a lot of songs on that album. It's good though. *****/***** <br /> <br />5. \\"Red Sky At Night\\" - Shortest track on the album, but it's not filler. Gilmour shows off his brilliant saxophone playing in a haunting track. This really reminds me of the heavily sax dominated Dark Side Of The Moon. *****/***** <br /> <br />6. \\"This Heaven\\" - An odder sounding track compared to the others. Probably the least Pink Floyd song on the album yet but I like it. It sounds more bluesy than most Floyd or rock songs in general. ****/***** <br /> <br />7. \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" - A very harmonic, melodic instrumental track. Unfortunately, it lacks a certain element the other songs had. It sounds a lot like The Division Bell. It sounds nice but it just doesn't have much of a drive to it. ***/***** <br /> <br />8. \\"Smile\\" - Another song that reminds me of \\"Fat Old Sun\\" and some of the Meddle tracks like \\"A Pillow Of Winds\\". It suffers from the same lack of energy that \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" had yet it manages to make up for it better than that song with the other elements of it. ***1/2/***** <br /> <br />9. \\"A Pocketful Of Stones\\" - Another Meddle sounding track but with a lot more piano to it. A nice song with nice piano playing. Slowly, the song increases in heaviness and the lyrics become increasingly darker. Finally, around the five minute mark, Gilmour cuts in with a dark, depressing guitar solo that fits the song perfectly and leaves nothing more to be desired from what is a beautiful solo that finishes out the song. *****/***** <br /> <br />10. \\"Where We Start\\" - This one sounds like a mix of Meddle and Wish You Were Here. A slow, melodic song, it works well enough I suppose for the album closer though I feel that \\"A Pocketful Of Stones\\" would've worked better. ****/***** <br /> <br />Gilmour brings to the table a fantastic mix of every era of Pink Floyd but in particular combines the sounds of \\"Meddle\\", \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\", and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" to create a great album. Though Pink Floyd may be gone, David Gilmour is here with an album that will please most fans of Floyd and continues the traditions begun by his old band.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I rate this album a 5 because it ROCKS HARD well....... not really i mean it in the way that it is really gooood Go BUY IT NOW FOR 17.99 at any local music store (well mostly anywhere)SO ya buy it and all the others cause the 40 year old rockers are wickid!!!!
B000ENWKN8|3.0|While not the instant booming classic of Rob Zombies previous works , this still rocks and gives depth to Rob's catologue.(Small, but still great)<br /><br />\\"Foxy Foxy\\", a song chiseled with a groovy beat (right from the get go) is the sure fired hit, and will be doomed to constant airplay.While the hits though aren't nearly as good as say \\"Dragula\\" they have a different approach to at least back it up.The songs are not incredibly heavy as one might expect.\\"The Scorpion Sleeps\\" starts off with a drum beat that could be found on say a beer commercial, it then bursts into a classic Rob sound.As for songs like \\"Let It All Bleed Out\\" the tempo speeds up and kicks up the power to this album.There is some familiar territory too(!), \\"American Witch\\" is no doubt the closest work to the previous albums.\\"Sawdust In Blood\\" is a little gem, the piano overlayed with demonic speeking of some sort is great!<br /><br />I'm giving this a 3 out of 5.No real issues at this time, but nothing to addictive to win me over, but it's non the less a stale album.<br /><br />Twisted lyrics and gravel like vocals sums up this album.If you like slow modern metal, you got a winner.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've always liked The Phantom of the Opera...I've seen the play, TV series about it and I was looking forward the release of this movie. Emmy Rossum is such a talented and lovely girl...and she interprets Christine like an angel. Is so pleasant to hear her sing...that it is impossible you don't fall in love with this movie.<br /><br />There is luxury everyway, the cast in general is excellent...the music is beautiful, when I saw the movie I felt so identified with the story, the passion, the feeling, the beauty of the story that I can say that this is one of my favorites movies ever.<br /><br />I saw it at the movies, then I saw it in HBO, and I ended up buying the DVD because it is a must have. It is soft, delicate, beautiful...a perfect escape of those full of especial effects and violent movies. If you like musicals, you will love this one.
B00005JOVN|4.0|\\"Poseidon\\" is one of those movies where character development, human inspiration, thought provoking themes, social commentary, or anything resembling an argument or point are all summarily ignored in favor of entertainment and a more visceral movie going experience.  Viewers can leave their brains at the door - they won't be needed here.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as Poseidon definitely achieves what it sets out to.  The audience will be enthralled with the amazing effects and entertained by the story of Macguyver style survival.  While this isn't great story telling, it is great movie making, and is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />The basic story of Poseidon is a silly as it is simple.  A huge wall of water crashes over a luxury ship while out at sea, tipping the massive boat over and submerging all the hapless inhabitants.  A small group of people ignore the pleas of the captain to remain in a sealed off room and await rescue.  Realizing the boat is going to sink soon, they search for a way out of the ship by climbing through the now upside down vessel.  Waves of this size don't actually occur anywhere in the open sea, as waves generally only exist in shallow areas or directly on shorelines, but that doesn't really matter.  The reasoning behind the movie is secondary to the action and effects, which are in abundant supply.  It's really unfair to compare the effects of this movie to the original \\"Poseidon Adventure\\", which was filmed over 30 years prior, but honestly this remake is a lot more believable than the first film.  In the original, it was quite obvious that people were voluntarily throwing themselves sideways while the camera tilted at an angle - showcased by the fact that none of the chairs fell from the ceiling.  No such suspension of disbelief occurs in this film, where quite a deal of effort has been expended to convince the viewer that a ship is in fact turning upside down.  Barring the very beginning of the movie, in which everything has a far too bright look and it's obvious some sort of green screen is being utilized, the effects used throughout the film are on par with those seen in recent special effects extravaganzas such as the Lord of the Rings series or the new remake of King Kong.  One particular effect of note occurs when a giant engine plunges through an upside down ceiling, unleashing a huge stream of fuel which soon catches on fire.  A superbly done giant pillar or flame streams endlessly downward, seemingly preventing passage by the intrepid group of survivors bent on escaping the ship.<br /><br />There is really only one direct translation of character from the original, and that is the character of the little boy who has befriended the various crew members and has a working knowledge of the boat's layout.  Everyone else is at least slightly different from the original characters.  Kurt Russell plays a character based on Gene Hackman's role in the original.  While Kurt delivers his lines in a much different style, it's easy to see why he was cast as this particular character, as Hackman and Russell look almost identical in close up shots and have very similar mannerisms.  The characters presented are all very stereotypical of our age.  There is a young couple who obviously cannot die as they are in love, a sternly disapproving father who has to show everyone how much he is willing to sacrifice for his family, a selfish man who will of course realize the error of his ways and become a more well rounded individual, a love-lorn man who wants to kill himself, and then the obligatory cannon fodder characters who will be offed quite quickly by the sinking ship.  Thankfully, they are all less annoying the characters in the original film.  During the first movie, it was hard not to root for the bleak cold depths of the oceanic deep to just get it over with and kill the lady who wouldn't quit sobbing uncontrollably and hold the team back, or the woman who would just not stop trying totell her husband to go on without her.  In the new version the viewer will never be so annoyed as to actually wish the death of any particular character.<br /><br />While lacking any kind of deep storytelling or characterization, Poseidon is a fun adventure, and worth at least viewing once.to tell her husband to go on without her.

B00005JMX6|4.0|It was good too see something new for a change. It did remind me of the 80's film Risky Buisness but this is no where near that film. Anyway the movie is a fun ride, and there are some redeming qualitys. The casting was great Tim Olyphant(Go) and James Remar (Mortal Kombat Annihilation) were a great choice. The movie is about taking chances and letting loose (Like taking E and blowing the future career youd been planning for years down the drain) but it all comes together as a love story. There is some kind of genius in this film and its alot more than your average teen sex comedy. Honestly the most amazing thing about this film is that, the same director who created The Animal (Rob Shneider) made this.
0895260131|3.0|I confess that I did not read this book...yet.  I gave it 3 stars so that I did not help or hinder its ratings.  I did find one thing  interesting about the reviews of this book.  Reviewer TW reviewed this book and gave it one star.  I clicked on his name to see all his reviews.  He did all his reviews on May 9th and gave any \\"anti Islam\\" book one star and all but one review is EXACTLY the same.  Am I supposed to believe anything that TW says.  Please....He found several books that he did not like the theme of, did not read them and gave them scathing reviews.  Come on...get a grip!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|What i love about this album is, it's like mixing al green's soul with modern day hip hop. The Album is short, but i can listen to this album over and over again. It has a lot of diverse tracks. Crazy obviously is a great, great song. My other favorite is \\"the Last Time\\" This album is VERY GOOD, go out and get it right now!!

Hitler and Lenin would envy Dan Brown who managed to write this anti-God and anti-Human book! Full of blasphemy! If you think of your life after you join your beloved ones high, up with the Gentle Fella, then read the Bible and just beware of this book. Shame on the author! Though he did one great thing - all the people of all beliefs are united, and they are united against this blasphemy! Read prayers, think of your beloved ones and think about your life....
B000AADYRQ|3.0|I like Death Cab a lot, they can be soothing and fun to listen to on long road trips, in coffee shops, etc. But then again, this CD can sound like this one long song being played over and over. There are only two different songs out of this whole CD. Don't get me wrong, I would choose Death Cab over Fall Out Boy any day (.. yes I'm comparing them to the unoriginality of Fall Out Boy) but then again this CD does not excite or get me going every day. I very much liked \\"We've Got The Facts and We're Voting Yes\\" etc. etc. but this CD lacks originality and does not stand out at all to me. But it doesn't bother me to listen to it from time to time. Songs like \\"Your Heart Is An Empty Room\\" and \\"Brothers on A Hotel Bed\\" have been added to my Mp3 player, but other than that, this CD isn't worth much.
B000FIMG68|2.0|I don't understand how many people have become addicted to this show. I liked season one very much but I just stopped watching in the end of the season. Why? I couldn't care less about what was happening or about the characters. The writers even managed to turn interesting characters like Swayer and Locke into dull material. I couldn't care less about the others either. For example I hated Charlie, Micheal or Yim so I coulnd't stand an entire chapter (hour ) devoted to flashbacks of any of them. Good job writers in ruining  a good show you clearly showed us no respect in not having any clue  where the story nor the characters are going.

B00005JOVN|4.0|I'm a big fan of disaster movies.  I also recently went on a cruise.  And I'm not all that fond of water.  So it was inevitable that I would see Poseidon, a movie that must be witnessed on the big screen for the full effect.<br /><br />Everyone knows the story by now: Poseidon, a massive cruise liner, flips over when a \\"rogue wave\\" strikes during a New Year's Eve celebration.  Just about every passenger is gathered in the grand ballroom, although the youngsters are also celebrating in one of the (invariably many) nightclubs on the ship.  And just like that, their world is literally turned upside down.<br /><br />Our hero is the professional gambler, Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas).  Rugged, shifty, and a little too smooth for his own good, Dylan is an ex-Navy man who lost his moral center.  He finally meets a woman seemingly immune to his charms in the form of Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett) and her son Conor (Jimmy Bennett).  What's a lovable rogue to do?<br /><br />One of those rich folks that Dylan separates from their money is Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a former New York City mayor and ex-fireman.  His daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) struggles for her independence with her boyfriend Christian (Mike Vogel). There's also the lovelorn Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss) who is considering killing himself, and the secret couple of Marco Valentin (Freddy Rodriguez) who smuggles aboard Elena Gonzalez (Mia Maestro). And how could we forget one-note Lucky Larry (Kevin Dillon)!<br /><br />While the ship's captain, Michael Bradford (Andre Braugher) advises that everyone stay in the ballroom, Dylan has other plans.  He leads Maggie, Conor, Robert, Richard, and Marco to find his daughter in the nightclub.  Facing their own struggles to survive in the nightclub are Jennifer, Christian, Elena and yes...Lucky Larry.<br /><br />I don't remember the original Poseidon Adventure very well, but it was a very detached experience, much less horror and much more of a character study.  Fortunately, director Wolfgang Petersen isn't interested in showing how good an actor can mime hysterics.  Instead, he goes for the throat; this is a disaster film and it looks like it: dead bodies float everywhere.  When the ship flips, everything flips with it, and we can never forget that our protagonists are upside-down because every sign, door, and table is the wrong way.  And then there's the water.<br /><br />Gurgling, growling, snaking through shafts, suffused with flames; water has never been so terrifying.  The survivors must swim through a conflagration, in the dark, through a nettle of wires, past floating dead bodies, and at one point, hold their breath to the breaking point.  It is horrible.  It is undoubtedly realistic.  It is a disaster movie with a capital D.<br /><br />Throughout, there are little bits of humor that help relieve the tension.  I mean, there's a guy named Lucky Larry for crying out loud!  Conversely, Poseidon is deadly serious about the plight of its characters, and the survivors must make a host of moral choices that force us to ask: faced with survival or death, would we make the same decisions and sacrifices?<br /><br />Disaster movies are in a particular quandary these days.  It's no longer sufficient to pretend that we're watching a make believe event that can happen to fictional people.  Always lurking in the back of our minds is the possibility that whatever disaster we're witnessing could happen to us...or happened recently.  When is a movie about a disaster appropriate?<br /><br />The answer is that there is no appropriate timing for a film.  I think releasing Poseidon on May Day was an inspired choice.  It's our reaction to it that moviegoers must ultimately decide for themselves.  If the film disturbs you...then perhaps that was the point.<br /><br />If you're ready for a wild ride, if you've ever been afraid of water, or if you always wondered what nature thinks of big floating cities in her oceans...see Poseidon.dy.

It is undoubtedly realistic.  It is a disaster movie with a capital D. <br /> <br />Throughout, there are little bits of humor that help relieve the tension.  I mean, there's a guy named Lucky Larry for crying out loud!  Conversely, Poseidon is deadly serious about the plight of its characters, and the survivors must make a host of moral choices that force us to ask: faced with survival or death, would we make the same decisions and sacrifices? <br /> <br />Disaster movies are in a particular quandary these days.  It's no longer sufficient to pretend that we're watching a make believe event that can happen to fictional people.  Always lurking in the back of our minds is the possibility that whatever disaster we're witnessing could happen to us...or happened recently.  When is a movie about a disaster appropriate?   <br /> <br />The answer is that there is no appropriate timing for a film.  I think releasing Poseidon on May Day was an inspired choice.  It's our reaction to it that moviegoers must ultimately decide for themselves.  If the film disturbs you...then perhaps that was the point.  <br /> <br />If you're ready for a wild ride, if you've ever been afraid of water, or if you always wondered what nature thinks of big floating cities in her oceans...seePoseidon.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|I'm hooked on this show, and its easily one of my favories. I'm very happy the 1st season will be available on DVD soon.
0618477942|5.0|This is a sharp, literate, excruciating, and mature piece of autobiography, which should with any justice nudge Alison Bechdel from cult favorite to widespread critical recognition.   <br /> <br />Her always appealing and humane art is given emotional depth and shadow with a layer of ink wash, which Houghton Mifflin has thankfully payed out to print in faded royal blue. <br /> <br />In terms of content, Bechdel ably and appropriately includes themes from Proust, Joyce, Homer, and F.Scott Fitzgerald as she strip-mines the contorted relationship between her younger self and her English teacher father.   <br /> <br />This is a work of real emotional honesty, paired with a professional execution.  It's also a welcome change from the relentless brand of masculine self-loathing dished out by R.Crumb and Harvey Pekar, and more mature than the delicate, achingly self-aware recent works by Craig Thompson.   <br /> <br />The overall quality and insight of the work brings it beyond being just a female, feminist, or queer genre piece (all of which Bechdel has done with great aplomb in the past);  with any luck it should make itself felt across the demographic bar chart.
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|I didn't see the movie in the theater but did catch it on pay per view TV recently and have bought the DVD as well.  <br />As usually happens with soundtracks I don't think I remember any of this stuff from the movie itself, but the samples sounded good here at Amazon so I bought myself a copy. <br />I'm not sure that any single tune is a favorite, and some have similar or identical bits in them but I did find a lot to like here, more than in other soundtracks I've had. <br />I think I liked #7 \\"Arrival at Netherfield\\" and #8 \\"A postcard to Henry Purcell\\" as well as anything but even the worst selections (can't remember what those were)had something good in them. Out of 17 song titles I'd guess half are under two minutes, if you don't like a selection, don't worry, it'll likely be done fast.
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|I won't even try to review this film, since there are so many helpful reviews at the other Battle Royale (theatrical release) product information page. I'm only writing this to ask other people who have seen both versions to tell other people where the difference lies. This director's cut is apparently longer, but I can't really say.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|I didn't really mind the length and thought the plot was pretty well laid out, the casting good too. The movie at just over three hours may have hurt it in this short attention span world but what is there to cut?  I don't know if I've ever seen the original so I can't really compare the two but Jackson's Kong was well written, the sets were great (apparently none of the story really filmed in New York)and most of the computer generated effects were top quality (I did think some of the dinosaurs didn't look quite right). I liked the characterization of Kong as an old, beat up, Gorilla.   I just have a few complaints;  #1 What happened to the natives?, you never see them after they offer Ann up to Kong. All the time the story spends on the island and you learn nothing much about them.  #2 The 'native' part of the island looks almost as fake, sometimes, as I remember the sets looking in the original, most of the story apears to have been shot somewhere real.  #3 Between Kong's capture (even if the ship's crew made their living capturing wild animals why'd they have so many gallons of chloroform- more than enough for Kong even)and the show in New York, where's the story? Not even a line about it except for a bit about Ann not working for Jack Black's character.  #4 Kong's weight and emotions. A 25ft. Gorilla would surely weigh in at 25 tons yet Kong would climb/sit on things as if he weighed a real world gorilla weight. Do real Gorilla's laugh or smile? I didn't mind it but I'm not sure that they do.    This movie is worth seeing and owning, I'll be getting a copy the next time I order DVD's I think.
0375831002|5.0|I just have to reiterate what \\"nokegchris\\" had to say.  I too read all the time and get poked fun at because of my \\"habit\\". I have varied tastes that run from Sci-Fi/Fantasy to History and Eastern and Western Philosophy.  This is one of my favorite books of all time.  The writing was excellent and it touched me deeply on a variety of levels.  I hope that the Young Adult marketing does not throw off the adults.   <br />ATTENTION ADULTS! This book is WELL worth your time.  I am just trying to figure out how to afford to send a copy to all of my close friends and family.
B00005NNMK|5.0|If we share the difference between this album and wings of tomorrow ( 1984 ), Joey Tempest sings in a slower rhythm ,the <br />songs are a bit lighter ,the riffs are slower and the keyboards started to be a permanent part of their sound. <br />For this purpose, this swedish hair metal band hired an official keyboardist. <br />However, it's still metal, the fast guitar solos were mantained. <br />Agression isn't an obligation in heavy metal.  <br />The final countdown is their most famous album and introduced me to Europe. When I first listened the leading song ( title track, a megahit ) in details I decided to get a copy almost immeadeatly. <br />I loved the guitar work ( by John Norum who decided to leave after the tour )and Joey Tempest's tuning.  <br />It was a record because , Europe was the band I wanted know better more quickly after listening to just one song. <br />In general the tracks have clutching atmosphere, are catchy, melodic and have good guitar work , but if you want John Norum shredding at his best try the previous 1984 recording. He did something crazy there that made me remember Van Halen in the 10 th track ( Dance the night away )  <br />The group used that \\"wo-oh\\" type vocals and I liked the effect.  <br />The final countdown is an excellent place to novice people in Europe. <br />No filler songs , a complete masterpiece , trust me.
0684857219|5.0|I bought this book a couple weeks ago and it is a tremendously good book. It outlines all of the Weider principles of training as well as being very specific about nutrition which is one place in particular I thought Weiders \\"Ultimate Bodybuilding\\" was lacking. The book starts out as a bit of a history lesson most of which I skipped over and then goes into the basics of exercise and fitness. It has advice for everyone from the beginner to the advanced competitor on everything from weight training to competition preparation and even psyching out the competition. I am not a competitive bodybuilder but it was very interesting to read these parts of the book and I think it will be very helpful if I ever decide to compete. I havent seen very many books that cover the actual competition side of things. The training routines are based on Schwarzeneggers training styles though and may not be best for everyone but you can take the knowledge from this book to help create your own personal routine.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Terrible action/horror movie that puts on a lot of hot air but lacks a lot of brains and substance to pull off the story its trying to tell. Keanu Reeves was just the wrong man for the job and his performance is that bad. You just want to smash his faces of the people who though that he was right for this kind of role. You just don't take him seriously and you end up laughing at him more than being intrigue by his character. His co-star Rachel Weisz not only has a more interesting character than he does but is 100 times more the actor he could ever hope to be. She not only gives the film's best performance (a performance that has more life and complexity than the film itself) but is the films only redeeming quality. You actually want to spend more time with her character and pick her brain on the life she have lived and the sister she has forgotten instead of the mindless dribble that the film because after the second act. Her story would have made a much better and scarier horror movie but of course this is a Keanu Reeves movie, and we have to suffer with a script and a director who will cater to his limited needs as an actor. The director has some talent with visuals but he has no idea on how to put a actual film together and the screenplay is so unfocused that you really have no idea on what is going on from time to time. <br /> <br />Worth a look for Weisz's efforts but don't hold out hope for a film as good as she was  <br /> <br />
0385333846|4.0|Slaughterhouse five is an absolutely wonderful book.  It is written in a very simplistic manner, yet it is so powerful that you'll wish there was more.  The main character, Billy Pilgrim, is an ordinary man who seems to be lost travelling through time.  You see his life both as foresight and as hindsight.  He is portrayed as an ordinary man who experiences exceedingly extraordinary events.  From his enlightening visits with the Tralfamadorians, which teach him much about humanity, to his horrifying experiences in Dresden, Billy's life is far from normal. <br />     To me, the novel deserves 5-stars. It is interesting, funny deep, and dark.  It has much to teach about life.  However, when reccomending it  to others I must point out that it is a strangely written novel and takes a certain mind to enjoy it.  It is the kind of book where, either you love it or you hate it.  Beyond that, Slaughterhouse five is one of the most powerful novels ever written.  It is a truly unique book.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Listened to this whole 2-disc set on a road trip yesterday.<br /><br />Here's a tip.<br /><br />Listen to Mars first.<br /><br />But it's all good.<br /><br />And Dani California is Sweet Home Alabama.
B0009IW8IK|4.0|The Swedes clearly figured out what worked well on their first album and decided to work with their strengths. Gone are all the little transitional instrumentation (violin, cello, female vocals) and overkill of experimentation. What we're left with is melodic death metal, filled with hooks and leads along with a more fine tuned aggression. They still run with acoustic interludes and an almost folk influence on occasions, yet the transitions are far better than on their debut album.  <br /> <br />The band hadn't yet settled on a line-up, with vocalist Anders Friden yet to join the fray. In fact, only Jesper Stromblad is still with the band today (2006) and he didn't play on the debut. So it's not completely surprising that Subterranean period In Flames is nothing like the albums released since the year 2000. Vocalist Henrik is great (also in Dawn) and Daniel's drumming is awesome, but it's once again the dual guitars of Jesper and Glenn that make this EP so good. Check out \\"Stand Ablaze\\" or \\"Subterranean\\" for exhibitions of brilliant melodic musicianship.  <br /> <br />In Flames are reaching their peak with Subterranean, both as musicians and as songwriters. With only 5 tracks and a running time of just over 20 minutes, it was an excellent teaser for the bands next couple of full length albums that would be the pinnacle of their career. Regain's re-mastered edition of this album released in 2004 has a far superior sound and is well worth purchasing, even for the fans that own the Wrong Again Records CD from the mid nineties, particularly for the bonus tracks and covers that come included.  <br /> <br />Overall, a step up in class for In Flames and a fine example of the Gothenburg sound that has been completely bombarded with clones for years since its release.
B000957O82|5.0|This movie was brilliant and funny.  Kevin James as Albert Brennamen and Will Smith as Alex Hitchins, were great together.  All the sequences are memorable - each has its moment.  You will laugh, and there is a great story to be learned.  I think this movie is underappreciated in many aspects.  It's one of my favorites of all time.  If you haven't you must! What are you waiting for?
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|Orphaned Land makes me proud to be a metal fan! With the complete lack of respect that the metal scene in general has to face due to a complete lack of understanding and narrow-mindedness, it can sometimes be difficult to admit that you think Carcass' \\"Necroticism\\" album is one of the best things you've ever heard. It's hard not to feel just a little apprehensive about letting your workmates know that your favourite band is My Dying Bride, or that Robbie Williams' latest album is crap compared to the latest Behemoth masterpiece. It's bands like Orphaned Land that release music of such a high quality and with a level of integrity and class that annihilate any doubts I have about my chosen path, and make me feel just a little perturbed that the majority of society are too narrow-minded to ever experience it.     It's been 7 years since the bands last studio album and I'm not completely sure whether this is due to environmental factors (they come from Israel) or whether the band has simply spent the 7 years preparing the album. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the latter turned out to be correct, since \\"Mabool\\" (which translates as \\"flood\\") is a truly monumental album, pieced together with such care and depth that I can't begin to imagine how much time and effort has gone into it.    After really enjoying \\"Sahara\\" back in the early 90s as well as its follow-up a year later, I was always hoping the band would release another studio album. If they did, I expected it would be a fine melodic death album with a major injection of Arabic influence. I expected it would show moments of intimacy and outbursts of powerful emotion and passion. I even expected the intense creativity that makes up this epic, but what I never expected was a religious theme based album that displays a level of musicianship and skilfully crafted pieces of work that has left me speechless. Well...almost.    Yes, you heard right. This album tells the story of the flood from the bible. Now, I find it difficult to not let my personal feelings about religion get in the way when I listen to Christian metal, but no-one should let that get in the way of listening to \\"Mabool\\". There is no preaching of any sort, this is purely story telling.    There are exquisite female vocals, excellent clean and death metal male vocals, incredible guitar solos, perfectly placed keyboards and samples, acoustic interludes, and crushing riffs. The range of emotions that Orphaned Land integrate to express their biblical story are just astounding and never sound contrived or overwhelming.    I find myself finishing reviews too often lately with \\"this album is not for everyone\\", but damn it, this one is! If you have even the slightest interest in heavy music, then there's no excuse not to check this out. It's album of the year and I'm proud to be a metal fan!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I had not paid much attention to this genre of film as most of them end up being complete \\"Cheese-fests\\" with horrible acting, dumb plots, and the typical empty characters.  Man was this different! <br /> <br />It was very well acted and the action sequences were terrific.  There were no \\"impossible\\" last minute saves or other unbelievable situations.  Everything was built up perfectly and the movie got better and better as it went along.  There were some intriguing plot twists and it was suspenseful just trying to figure out who the real bad guys were and who the good guys were.  That was another point I liked, it actually presented the story, especially towards the end, from a different perspective and that potentially changed your feelings towards the characters.  Very solid!!! VERY SOLID! <br /> <br />Of course Kate Beckinsale is a fabulous babe and her performance would have been awesome even if she wasn't hot....but what the heck, she IS hot and that just makes it all the better.  The casting for this movie was just about 100% which makes a huge difference in the quality of a film.  If the wrong actors play the wrong roles...the movie is screwed before it even starts. <br />  <br />This is the kind of film to watch several times and really get into it which makes it very well worth owning in my opinion.   <br /> <br />What can I say?  Great movie all around.  If you like this type of film I see no reason not to go add it to your collection ASAP!
B000001C6M|5.0|Slayer's importance to extreme metal in general can never be underestimated. When metal was at its most groundbreaking and exciting peak, these U.S. youngsters were the driving force (along with another young American band you may have heard of called Metallica), releasing several hugely influential albums along the way. \\"Show No Mercy\\" is merely the beginning of this journey, but filled with significance for more than this reason alone. If one looks at where metal was at the time of its release (1983), it's no wonder Slayer caused such a stir. The obvious influences are Venom, Iron Maiden and Metallica. In fact, it was the latter of these three bands that influenced Slayer to play faster and more aggressive after the youths witnessed a Metallica concert in 1982. But while Venom's albums were tongue in cheek Satanic, Slayer's music, image and lyrics were as evil as music got. Tracks such as \\"Evil Has No Boundaries\\" and \\"Black Magic\\" dripped with malevolence and metal has never looked back since.    Looking at the album today after 23 years, it's surprisingly still a great listen. The band had already found their sound. It's dirtier and less produced than anything that would follow, but the trademark Slayer riffs and solos, as well as the mid paced powerful drumming is already in place. Tom Araya's vocals contained more high-pitched screaming than usual as was the trend of the day, but considering the range of his voice, it was never a bad thing. Quite a few of these tracks would be played live for many years to come including \\"Die by the Sword\\" and \\"The Antichrist\\" and I certainly see \\"Show No Mercy\\" as not simply a fine piece of nostalgia, but a bloody impressive slab of thrash metal, filled with youthful exuberance and talent. The fact that the band still today contains the same four members is proof enough of just how well these guys function together and that their vision has always been singular.    All in all, a great and entertaining debut release from a bandthat would very soon enter the realms of metal immortality.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Great album, Jack White with a full band, oh man, cool sound terrific lyrics, one of the best bands i've ever heard
B0006HXXBA|5.0|Now this is what thrash is all about! I must admit that I'd almost given up on thrash a few years ago. With more and more of my previously favourite thrash entities either disbanding (Exodus), moving away from their roots (Metallica) or releasing sub-standard albums (Megadeth), it looked like the genre was finally about to kick the bucket.    Then all of a sudden, the thrash machine has regained its momentum, and a string of excellent releases and band reformations have come about. Exodus, Sodom, Testament and now Kreator have released their best albums since the 80s and thrash is back!    \\"Enemy of God\\" is Kreator's 11th full-length studio album and comes 20 years after their debut \\"Endless Pain\\". Their earlier releases are pure classics, with 1986's \\"Pleasure to Kill\\" and 1989's Extreme Aggression\\" being the highlights. Although the band went through an uncomfortable experimental phase through the mid to late 90's, 2001's \\"Violent Revolution\\" displayed a renewed vitality and aggression that has recreated the bands glory years. \\"Enemy of God\\" continues this form and in fact raises the bar even higher.    Right from the outset, it's apparent the band means business. The title track is an awesome way to kick off the album and the sound is incredible. Ripping riffs, venomous vocals and some very impressive drumming combine in controlled violence. Mille has taken inspiration from the world's current political and religious climate, which gives him plenty of ammunition to fire and that recognizable German accent remains intact, even if he's learnt to pronounce his v's much better these days.    There are 12 tracks on \\"Enemy of God\\", all of them of suitable high Kreator quality. The difference between the old and new Kreator is that the modern phenomenon have the ability to slow it all down without displaying seams, whereas the band's minimal musicianship of the early years once hindered that sort of variety. 2005 Kreator is tight and technically superior. The nave youthfulness of their teenage years may have been long left behind, but the experience and understanding of Mille's troops more than carries the burden of expectation.    2005 has started with a bang, and if \\"Enemy of God\\" is anything to go by, we're in for one hell of a ride. Bring it on!
B0002W4SWC|5.0|What can I say? My single 20 something friends and I made an evening of seeing this movie and going for cocktails later. Our jaws dropped at the opening sequence of Bridget reading magazines, eating take out on her couch, checking her phone messages, watching re-runs late at night and drinking wine--we recognized ourselves!  <br /> <br />Renee Zwellinger is hilarious in this film and makes Bridget seem very real. We blush and laugh while feeling embarrassed for Bridget as she makes a bunch of goof-ups that are so familiar for many of the 20 something females out there. We watch her juggle between career, two men(you know the types--bad boy and boyfriend material), family drama --all with the loyal support of her friends, of course! <br /> <br />If you loved Sex in the City, you will love Bridget Jones!
B000AADYYO|5.0|There are very few things that I can truly rely upon these days. Australia lost the Ashes to England in the cricket which should never have happened! Every TV show I enjoy gets cancelled! Even life itself cannot be trusted, with natural disasters ravaging the Earth all over the place this year. At least there's Opeth! Every year or two, these Swedish legends release another cracking album. No other band comes close to them for sheer consistency, at least anywhere near this quality.    It may be easy to categorise Opeth's albums into the masterpiece grouping, but it's not quite as easy to describe their music to the uninitiated. If I said death metal, you'd think of a band like Morbid Angel and they're nothing like that. If I said progressive metal, you'd probably think of a band like Evergrey and that wouldn't be fitting either. I'm going to call it atmospheric melodic progressive death metal. One thing to note about \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is that the progressive part has become much more prevalent. But that's not to say that Opeth have gone soft. This is still very much in the vein of \\"Blackwater Park\\" and \\"Deliverance\\", with death vocals mixed with clean, some crushing riffs, and a generally dark feel. Yet there's a much greater emphasis on musicality and interweaving styles, from classical music to seventies progressive rock, to magnificent mind shattering metal arrangements. It's one of those albums that the more you listen to it, the more you pick up, and the better it gets.    So much has been said about these guys already, but I really think this is their most mature album to date. I've always praised Mikael's (and Peter's) guitar work, but everyone involved has stood up on this album and displayed an immense amount of talent. Martin's drumming has always been solid, but now it is breathtaking. Mikael's vocals have improved, and considering how good he was before, that's saying something.     Every track just oozes class and all those Opeth-bashers (and there are quite a few) are seriously missing out due to some strange tall poppy syndrome. But for every jealous detractor, there are twenty Opeth worshippers anticipating new material, so I guess that's as close as I can get to a perfect world where bands get the attention and praise they truly deserve.    Highlights for me are \\"The Baying of the Hounds\\", \\"Hours of Wealth\\" and the monstrous \\"The Grand Conjuration\\", but Opeth simply can do no wrong in my books. \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is up there with \\"Still Life\\" and \\"Blackwater Park\\" as the best album from one of metal's finest acts. If you only buy around three or four albums this year, make sure this is one of them. Enough said.
B0007O38F8|5.0|I can listen to this whole cd without skipping a single song. Position of Power is an awsome song. 50 did a great job with this album. Pick this one up because it is hot!
B000089J0R|5.0|I will be honest.  I bought this album as a joke.  Their name, the d&d-themed lyrics, and thier look seemed completely irrasistable for a good laugh.  I laughed a lot...and then the laughter stopped.  Why?  Because this is the fastestest, most musically talented metal band EVER, thats why.  Herman Li is an incredible guitarist.  More than incredible, he is a god of his art.  And that's not to say the rest of the band is chopped liver.  They all rock.  I've actually come to love the cheesy lyrics, and I often sing along.  I listen to this album every day, and so should everyone, as far as I'm concerned.  Buy it.  Love it.
B00005JOUM|4.0|A film that is very well built as an action film, though the cops are trapped by the burglars with a microphone brought to them by a released hostage. How can New York policemen be that negligent and sloppy ? Apart from that, and maybe because of that, it all looks very convincing, though we know very fast what it is all about. The point is just to let us get involved in the bank robbery and in the naive unprofessionalism of the police and how they are fooled like little boys and girls that don't play games on their gameboys or consoles. This long and slow building of a logical mesmerizing plot is there to hide the final kick you will get in your brain without even realizing it and this punchline will nicely survive in your subconsciousness without even realizing it is there in your head : the Jews are invisible and dark plotters who do things in the back of everyone and know no law of any kind and no limit at all when they are trying to get some kind of a vengeance. That kind of a subliminal openly disagreeable punchline is absolutely irritating because it reveals the entertaining film you have been watching for more than two hours has a totally different objective and agenda.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne
B00000K19E|4.0|One of the most compelling things about The Matrix is its biblical theme on Messianism, the belief that a particular hopeful saviour, who is usually derived from the outside world, comes and saves the world.     The protagonist of this film is obviously Neo. Here, his name literally means `new,' as in a new concept or idea being formed. He resembles Jesus in being `the absolute One' that is able to perform miracles and in conflict with Thomas Anderson, the Satan in this movie.     The Matrix demonstrates that the story of Jesus is still relevant in today's world. Although the real Satan may lack the black rimed sunglasses and sophisticated suit, this film is capable of showing us His miracles, teachings, and inevitable love for humanity.
0312995423|1.0|Having read Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, I had high expectations when I bought this book. I am disappointed with this read because... <br />- it was too emotional, seems like this book was written with a movie in mind. <br />- I could guess what will happen next and I was right most of the time. <br />- I guessed the pass key 11 pages before it was revealed. <br /> <br />Bottom line, not Dan Brown's best work!
B00005O3VC|4.0|As a teacher of medieval Grail literature, I have shown \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" to many generations of students -- and indeed there are a number of scenes that really do help young people understand either the medieval literary tradition or medieval history. These include not only the unforgettable \\"Bring out your dead scene,\\" which educates the fortunate modern viewer on the ubiquity of the medieval Bubonic Plague, but also the Grail Castle with its unimaginable and unaskable question, not to mention the over-the-top battle ethos that would lead to a knight's having not only his arms and legs cut off but also his head! It's hard to believe that such scenes have their medieval progenitors (though I do have to say I know of no medieval precedent for the \\"shrubbery\\" scene), but honestly they do.    More than that, however, in my book the very best scene of this film has absolutely nothing to do with the Grail or with anything medieval -- and that is the scene of the fierce rabbit. I still cannot watch this film without cracking up (as we moderns say) over the scene in which the \\"harmless little rabbit\\" attacks the Arthurian troupe. The hubris that the rabbit scene uncovers is a sadly (but hilariously) universal feature of human nature.    But even the rabbit scene hooks back into the medieval theme, as it links to an exploration of a cave with literary texts that conclude because \\"....arrgh....\\" Well, indeed, many medieval texts remain unfinished, perhaps because the authors died, more likely due to the vagaries of preservation. So Monty Python has something to say not only about history and literature but about literary history; in its very aesthetic form, this film reminds us that the standard linear narrative is not the only way of organizing a story. Many medieval stories are likewise structured either allegorically or with significant disruptions, such as this film has, that reveal that a story is something that is constructed and has its gaps and interventions.    In the \\"Age of the Da Vinci Code\\" -- another far less successful Grail story --  I'd be happy to see folks go back to Monty Python for their understanding of medieval literature and Chrisitainity. Maybe they'd learn that all enigmas are not meant to be solved; some are meant to be the topic of cleansing and cathartic laughter.
B00005JOWR|5.0|A very nicely done film about a cigarette lobbyist that deep down hates his job but loves what he does apologizing for the industry and basically making people do a complete 180.  Its basically a collection of short segments of his life with on real overarching storyline.  Unlike most movies of this type that is a good thing.   <br /> <br />His relationship with his son  <br />His relationship with a former spokesmen for the people he works for who has since become a spokesmen for the anti-cigarette people  <br />His dealings with a group of militant anti-smoking advocates  <br />The most hilarious is his relationship with his only friends the so called merchants of death.   <br /> <br />With excellent acting from pretty much the entire cast this movie will not disappoint you.    <br />
B000EHSVOG|5.0|I first saw this movie as a kid when it was released in the theaters.  As the years have gone by, I have come to appreciate the cinematic genius, the special effects, and the plots and subplots of this fine movie.  Irwin Allen was truly one of a kind.    Unfortunately Hollywood can't/won't make movies like this anymore.  Sometimes they try with flops like \\"Independence Day\\" or \\"The Day After Tommorrow, and the like but they are all pretty one-dimensional.    The Towering Inferno has EVERY thing you need for great entertainment.  The story is set around a 135 story building that hails as the tallest in the world and which has been constructed with substandard materials, especially electrical wiring.  From that starting point there are all kinds of stories that intersect and end in a high rise fire.    The overall \\"feel\\" of the movie is one that is lost these days.  There is an undeniable elegance in that runs throughout the whole film. The scenery of San Francisco as a backdrop, the sets, costumes, and music give it something that sets it apart from other films of its type.  Even the very beginning of the film with the credits is larger than life.  The rest of the movie just gets better.    It was nominated for Best Picture in 1974 and in my opinion should have won.  It ended up winning awards for techincal achievements.  However, Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, and William Holden were, in my opinion, overlooked in the acting category.  Yet they were excellent.  Fred Astaire was nominated for a supporting role as Harlee, the con man, but lost.    More than just an extremely well done movie, it is one that grabs you from the get go and thoroughly entertains in a classy, dramatic way. The special edition DVD comes with an extra disc that gives you a lot of details, theatrical trailers, an interview with Irwin Allen and more.  It is well worth it to pay a little more for this special edition.  This is one of a kind.
B000000H6D|5.0|Not since black sabbath has a band been able to progress - dark, tuned down distorted heavy guitar based music with such melody and genuine creativity. The melodism and creativity in the songwriting is just simply awe inspiring. Peter Steele (vocals, base)is raw, honest, self deprecating, intense and full of dark humour - in a touching  genuine way. This album is a true rarity, what heavy metal should be about but all too often isnt
B00000JNO1|5.0|This is one of Skynyrds finest moments! <br />The album gets a heavy start with - Saturday Night Special, and to my opinion theres not bad song on the album. <br />Its a mix of heavy bluesy songs and not heavy but bluesy songs. The album feels very honest, true and well written <br />Its their album after their mega success witb Sweet Home Albamala........ <br />So dont hesitate - Go and get the sweet sounds of the south.
B0002TX4QQ|5.0|Shriver's novel suffers from a cover that cheapens its contents and a title that sounds like a Scholastic book for young readers.  Neither of these convey the literary genius of this story.  If I were crowned an editor, I would have would have titled this book Before and After That Thursday.  This is great literature manufactured as mere \\"fiction.\\"  It is as readable as anything on the bestseller list, though (no literary pretension here).<br /><br />Our narrator is Eva Khatchadourian, the mother of teenaged Kevin, who murdered seven high-school students, a cafeteria worker, and a beloved teacher in a single day (that Thursday).  Sure, the murders and the aftermath are juicy, but the story covers much more ground than the \\"incident.\\"  In a series of letters to her estranged husband, Eva examines her childhood, family relations, dating life with her husband, their marriage, the decision to have children, Kevin's troubled youth, and more.  Eva can't tell the story of Kevin, the story that made the headlines, without talking about her background and the foundation of her marriage.<br /><br />The examination of Eva's marriage and Kevin's childhood is both the strength and (slight) weakness of this novel.  Eva has no answers, and Kevin has never been open with her, nor has he ever found joy in his life, not from the time he was born.  The novel consists of Eva's meditation on every incident, every fight, every issue that shaped her family.  The weak point is that the narrator occasionally ruminates in too much societal detail, but overall, her observations are brilliant and relevant to the overall story of Kevin's life.<br /><br />The novel has one twist which any reader might see from dozens of pages away, and even though I was expecting it, it was much different than I imagined.  It still socked me in the gut, no matter how much slight foreshadowing the author offered throughout the text.<br /><br />Kevin is a fascinating psychopath, one who despises the other school killers.  He planned to show them all up with his body count, but Columbine killers Harris and Kebold \\"beat him\\" just a few weeks after his killing spree, much to Kevin's dismay.  Kevin is also especially proud because he planned his targets carefully and did not commit \\"random\\" violence.  As frustrating as Eva's relationship with Kevin is, the reader finally sees a small, small human side to her son at the end of the book.<br /><br />This is an epic tale of a marriage, motherhood, family, and a small town.  Eva's meditations on her life, her marriage, and her influence on Kevin are poignant and unforgettable.  This is a must-read novel.r school killers.

0345350472|3.0|Not many directors can make a film that surpasses the book on which they base their work. Stanley Kubrick was a rare example of a director who accomplished the art. Ridley Scott, who directed Blade Runner, managed to do the same with Philip K. Dick's 1968 detective science fiction novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep.<br />The book narrates the story of Rick Deckard who is a bounty hunter in a post-apocalyptic San Francisco. His job is to `retire' androids who have escaped various colonies and illegally returned to earth. His hobby is to dream of owning real or artificial pets. While not quite hitting the impressive mark as a detective story, given the seeming ease with which the androids are detected and destroyed, Dick brings up quite a few serious ethical, moral and political issues. Faced with an empty existence Deckard ponders his relationship with his wife, his job and religion all the while craving artificial organisms as pets and lovers. His life and job lead to interesting questions. Is his job moral when an 'andy' can be an opera singer, negotiator, pharmacist or anything else? What is the definition of life and is it anachronistic?<br />In many respects, except for the literal storyline, the novel is reminiscent of Heinlein's seminal work, Stranger In A Strange Land. Some of the science fiction seems dated and the author's pontifications seem at odd with mainstream thought today. That, however, might say more about contemporary shortcomings than anything else.<br />The book - much like the film version - leaves a major question ambiguous and for the reader to ponder, while simultaneously leaving many hints and landmarks as clues to the answer.<br />Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is a philosophical book that forces the reader to make a judgement call. Dead, alive or in-between the point is poignant and thought-provoking.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I am a man of few words so I will not bore you with some long description of this CD. Suffice it to say this is the Pepper's best yet. Not a bad track on either CD. Congrats to the band for a great effort and buy it you will not regret it.
B0000AFONX|5.0|i had to write a review after  seeing the 2 idiots at the bottom of this first page, basicly there's only 2 reasons you wouldn't like this band,  <br />A)don't like bands with talent <br />B)don't like female singers in a rock band or any band <br /> <br />this album is incredible I can't wait till there new album , everything about the band is nothing like you've ever heard <br />Luguna Coil, or whatever the name is, don't even compare, to Evanescence, i listened to them , and they got nothing, not to mention Amy lee's voice is uncomparable to anyone on the planet ! <br />she takes your breath away on just about every song,  <br /> <br />so for all the clowns that don't like it, don't know what talent is in the first place... get a life,lol stick with your simple music, that goes nowhere, after all 1 star reviewers ! there record sales speak for themselves over 6 Million. !!! <br /> <br />Rock on !!
B000F48CD8|3.0|If all your looking for is alot of catchy singing then you may enjoy this album. If your looking for jack whites wailing guitar however, your looking in the wrong place. white stripes fans, especially those who have seen them live(under the blackpool lights is fantastic), know the incredible emotion that jack gets across through chrunching rythm and screaming leads. The only song on the album showing any instrumental skill is the amazing store bought bones. youll will find some great melodies in songs like steady as she goes and call it a day. but most of the tracks will lose your attention fairly quickly. lyrically it is quite good but not memorable. my reveiw most likely reeks of discontent due to the imense hype this album had. i give this album three stars because it IS better than most work out there. you may listen through the whole thing a few times after you first get it, but give it a couple months and all you will want to keep is a few individual songs.
B000000WHX|2.0|I don't get why this CD is such a big deal other than it was the first CD that Massive attack released. I consider myself a massive attack fan, but it just sounds very outdated to me. Don't get me wrong. There are a few songs that point to group becoming excellent in the future. Five man Army is great. So is blue lines, and Safe from harm is alright for sounding like early 90's dance, but other than that I didn't care for it.
B000006045|5.0|This Cd was just so smooth, mellow, and sensual. I can't think of one track on it that I didn't like or hate. It was a masterpiece from start to finish. My favorite tracks on it had to be Dissolved girl, Man next door, Inertia Creeps, Risingson, and Mezzanine. If your into Portishead, You'll love this album.
B000000W6X|4.0|A lot of people prefer blue lines over protection and I just don't understand that. I found protection to be great. Possibly one of the best CDs that Massive attack has ever released other than Mezzanine. Eurochild is mindblowingly amazing. Karmacoma, Better things, Heat Miser, weather storm and spying glass are also exceptional. The only reason I don't give this a 5 star rating is cause of the last track. A cover of the Doors, Light my fire that, to me, seems very pointless.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|AWFUL!!! this movie was by far one of the, if not the worst movie I've seen in my life.  If you buy this, I suggest you check yourself into a psyche ward!!
B0007Y08IS|2.0|Isn't it interesting that a million and one movies can be made that are anti-Bush, anti-Republican, anti-Conservative, anti-traditional values, but one movie comes out that is Pro-Bush, and suddenly it's a conspiratorial, right-wing, fascist propaganda machine going on where we must all head for cover before they get us. <br /> <br />It's just like the folks who accuse Fox News of being biased in favor of Republicans as if no bias ever existed before one little 10-year old cable news station popped up. <br /> <br />The movie does hit on some great points: liberal actors who pretend to know of an existence outside of their backyards, but actually know squat; and the phenomena of believing a leader's word when they say they have nothing that could kill us even while forbidding us access to search.  <br /> <br />As far as the movie itself, I think it sucks. It's over the top in every way. There is one scene where one of the puppets vomits for an entire minute. Not funny in the least. And all of the voices sound exactly like South Park characters: Kim Jong II sounds just like Cartman.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|<br />...and Flea and Kiedis aint that bad either. <br /> <br />What I did was not listen to any of or read any reviews before receiving the disc(s) in the mail, being as I'd like to formulate my own opinion. <br /> <br />2+ hours later, I found myself wanting to listen to this music over and over. This to me wasn't one of those recordings that needed to \\"grow on me\\". I liked it instantly. And the more and deeper I listened, the more appreciation I garnered. <br /> <br />These musicians are truly unparalled. Frusciante is at his best in some time. Kiedis' voice is an instrument itself, marvelous. Smith is clean and hard. Flea is Flea...on time, funky and unique. <br /> <br />28 songs too much...? Hardly. It works and it works well. I do think however, that at times pacing is an issue, but I give this a rating of a 5 as nothing in the last couple of years conjures up such an array of emotion. It transfers nicely from an energy ridden diddy to a melodic pop, and in many cases, in a particular song. <br /> <br />Rock, funk, jazz, and Ska are all present. My preconceived notions were...\\"I hope it's not like their last two releases, (though they were very good) and it's not not. It's better. It's obvious the boys spent many an hours honing their skill. <br /> <br />Too many songs to rate, but a couple of standouts are (in no order): <br /> <br />21st Century <br />She Looks To Me <br />Slow Cheetah (reminds me of a summertime drive) <br />Torture Me <br />Readymade (best jam I've heard in some time) <br />C'mon Girl <br />Turn It Again <br /> <br />Listen to this...I mean REALLY listen to this. NOBODY can match their musicianship or degree of uniqueness. There's a depth to this music. There's an obvious maturation that has occured. <br /> <br />Thanks RHCP's for for sharing...the entire CD is great. <br /> <br />
0064471837|5.0|I had two friends and a teacher recommend this book for me, so I decided to try it out. Sabriel is a wonderful fantasy full of magic and new creatures. A girl named Sabriel is daughter of the Abhorsen. One day when she is at school, her father appeared to her, obviously bound in death. He turns over to her the instruments of an Abhorsen. This is the moment that Sabriel has been waiting and training for, the time when she becomes Abhorsen. A Greater Dead is stirring in the Old Kingdom. Free Magic and evil are coming together. More and more dead are coming into life and invading, despite all her fathers' charms and spells. Her father is dying, so Sabriel must re-bind the dead and try to rid the Old Kingdom of this Greater Dead. This is no easy task for Sabriel, because now that she is the Abhorsen, the only one who can bind the dead, she is hated and hunted by the dead. She accumulates help from different and new people, and you will have to read the rest to find out what happens. This book was one of those books that you would read in one day, it's so good. Sabriel is the first book in the series, followed by Lirael, Abhorsen and Across the Wall. The story definitely has many interesting twists in it. Garth Nix is an absolute genius. Almost everything can tie into each other in an exciting sort of way. It is a book for everyone; it has magic, action, mystery, horror, romance and even some humor. It has animals and mythical beings and it can relate to the sort of medieval stories.<br /><br />When I first read this book, I admit I was a little frightened by the immense details in the book, but I refused to stop reading. As I read on, I found I didn't want to stop. As I was reading I went from almost crying, to white knuckled fear, to sappy, to devastating, back to sad and surprised. You will feel a huge range of emotions as you read this book. One if the things I learned from this book was how many emotions and themes you could fit into one book! I thought it impossible, but now I can try and put more feeling into my writing because I know it can be done! I have recommended this book to many of my friends and have caught them reading it. I hope to catch you too!ut now I can try and put more feeling into my writing because I know it can be done! I have recommended this book to many of my friends and have caught them reading it. I hope to catch you too!
B00005JKC3|4.0|After reading some of the reviews for the Hulk I thought it was going to be horrible.  I was surprised to find out it wasn't that bad.  Yes, there are boring parts and yes, there is some bad acting and yes, the Hulk does resemble a certain green ogre, but after watching the Hulk take down some tanks and helicopters and kicking Nick Nolte's [...] I realized this movie, was not that bad.
0060005424|5.0|Lirael was a Clayr. She had lived with the Clayr her whole life, but she some how didn't fit in like she would like. The Clayr's signature look was blonde hair, dark skin and light eyes. Lirael had black hair, fair skin and dark eyes. Another thing that set her apart from the Clayr was the Sight. The Sight was what all the Clayr used to see glimpses of the future. They usually acquired the Sight at about ten years of age. Lirael was fourteen and she still hadn't awoken with the Sight. Lirael was contemplating suicide on her fourteenth birthday when she had a stumble-in with the two head Clayr, Ryelle and Synar. She told them how she felt and they put her to work in the Clayr's Library to get her mind off things. The library was a very dangerous place. She had a run-in with a Stilken, and after binding it, was now the library's protector, unbeknownst to the Chief, or anyone for that matter. She also tried to make a charter sending and instead unleashed a very powerful being that became her best friend. During her whole time in the library some evil is being dug up that shouldn't be, and the Clayr have seen Lirael in this whole mess. So Lirael is sent off into the Old Kingdom by herself and her friend to fight this powerful Free Magic being.  <br />I really enjoyed this book. It was my favorite out of all the books. It was also the longest I read, and I like long books, because you get to be with the characters longer. This book was a very intense book. There were so many places where I could not put the book down. If there was a fire I would not put the book down it was that good. I think that Garth Nix does an excellent job at creating this whole other world. The details are immense, Garth has the best imagination I have read yet. I hope to recommend this book to everyone who has even seen Sabriel, much more read it. It is incredible how everything has a twist and are all connected. I hope you all love the book as much as I did.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is a great movie.  It has great acting(William Dafoe was the perfect choice for the Green Goblin) Sam Raimi is also a great director and probably one of the few who could take the comic book Spiderman and adapt it to the Big screen.  The shots of Spidey swinging through New York are sweet.  Overall this is the best superhero franchise so far, although Batman is making a comeback with Batman Begins, after so many lousy superhero movies its refreshing to have a great movie like this.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Ms. Nash needs a new set of ears, or something.  This is an amazing album, haven't enjoyed a popular release as much since Hymns of the 49th Parallel [and for some of the same reasons - great songs, wonderful performances].  Brilliant.
B00003CXSP|5.0|This is well done film on so many levels. And works in many different styles of films. It's chilling and dramatic. It's wickedly funny and in the broadest sence a love story. Beast finds his beauty, but what if the beast's sins are too much to overlook for beauty. The movie plays out like an opera which is fitting for the character of Hannibal Lecter also. <br />Each act of the film served with perfect timing like a chef serves his meals. Yes, pun intended. But it's just a beautiful movie. Beautiful to look at, and beautiful to let it soak in to your mind and simmer. Well, there I go again, but it's a must own for fans of the books and character. Or just fans of Hoppkins who really sinks his teeth into the role.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|so, i just bought this cd, along with my unrated awesome edition of napoleon dynamite, VOTE 4 PEDRO, and now i'm totally hip and all the make-up drenched girls who think they're Joan Jett, but in actuallity have no clue who Joan Jett is, so let's say, who think Karen O (OH MAN THE YEAH YEAH YEAHS ROCK SO HARD, THEY'RE SO ORIGINAL AND GROUNDBREAKING!) is a god, and guys, think i'm awesome.    oh man, i can't wait for someone to make a chuck norris joke.
B00005JKZ2|2.0|This from the very beggining feels off. Something is missing from this one that was in the first. And it's not lack of being original, because the story works, and it's not flawed preformances because everyone brings it to the table. Just the heart of the movie is gone. It feels witout a skelliton. <br />Each trick seems to be like that guy at the party thats always funny but just having an off night. I'ts fun in places, but when it's not, you feel it ten fold. Rent, don't buy.
0671027344|1.0|Everyone went ga-ga over this book in my high school, so I figured I better read the latest pop novel everyone was saying was so wonderful.  <br /> <br />Frankly, the writing is beneth anyone with an 8th grade education. The issues dealt with in this little tome are complex but are potrayed and simple. There is so much going on that one doesn't really find anything out about the charecters or about themselves.  <br /> <br />Again, it's ok for a young adult/childrens book. Anyone who is looking for substance and not sensationalism and drama should avoid this book.
B00005JO20|4.0|I went into this film expecting a good FX no story summer movie offered under the cloack of a holiday release. <br />What you get is an fx chariter that is so full of life and soul that you abbandon all thought of FX and relax to the story. And although Jack Black is a bit Hammy in scenes it make no difference. Naomi Watts gives steller legs to the cut out character as thin as paper. But she fattens the part up and gives her a pulse. There is a looming Lord of the Rings feel to the scull iland that is felt no matter if you know that Director or not. But a very Great film none the less.
B0000009RT|5.0|In 1966, a double LP by a rock band was unheard of. And yes, it was a band. Frank Zappa gets the lion's share of the credit, being the cheif songwriter. But as the title on the cover says, it's \\"The Mothers Of Invention.\\" The first incarnation of an ever-revolving cast of musicians, all of whom had lots and lots of talent.<br /><br />As a CD, Freak Out loses some of its impact. Even though the artwork is all intact, and it's the same music, tweaked a little here and there, it's the same recordings, nonetheless. But the tactile sensation of opening a 12x12 cover into a 12x24 gate-fold onslaught is lost here. And you can tell the division of the format a little better on the LP, as the first half is  based more on traditional song structure and the second half is more experimental.<br /><br />Song titles and content vary, from social criticism (\\"Hungry Freaks\\") to songs about boy-girl relationships (\\"You Didn't Try To Call Me\\") to flat-out weirdness (\\"Who Are The Brain Police?\\"). But despite the gritty, even greasy sound, there is an innocence to it; although the band and its image are anything but. This was the most scandalous, possibly the most hated rock band in history, and they used this to their advantage. Radio stations wouldn't touch them, and every television appearance was riddled with controversy. Phone lines would flood with people who loved them, or hated them. It seems that \\"Freak Out\\" was more of a social/cultural phenomenon than a piece of music. The sleeve notes describe this in pretty vivid detail, and it would be counter-productive and a little tedious to quote it all here.<br /><br />Creative highlight: The last segment of the format, from \\"Help I'm A Rock,\\" right on through \\"The Return Of The Son Of Monster Magnet.\\" This is a suite of \\"songs,\\" for lack of a better word, more like rhythms accompanied by layer upon layer of sounds. \\"Monster Magnet\\" is the peak. It has such an elaborate spectrum of sounds and textures, it boggles the mind at first. Warning! NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH CONSERVATIVE TASTES IN MUSIC! Frank Zappa's strict anti-drug stance is cleverly hidden here, because a lot of people think you have to be stoned or tripping to come up with this. But the truth is, absolutely not; You just need some imagination to come up with it, the intellect to pull it out, and the intelligence to pull it off.<br /><br />Subsequent works showed more sophistication, but this is the true ground-breaker.WITH CONSERVATIVE TASTES IN MUSIC!

B000F1IQN2|5.0|When the name of Speilberg is mentioned to anyone pretty much it conjors the images of Giant Great Whites, aliens, dinosaurs, and of course Goldie hawn running from the law in Sugarland Express...well maybe not that last one. But what I'm getting at is that it easy to forget the Schindler's List, Amistad, Saving Private Ryan, and now this Masterpiece that is Munich. <br />Speilberg can really get your attention when he wants to, and he does in this. The shots and Characters are full and rich. The way he is able to put down his Blockbuster cap, and pick up his I don't give a damn if you like it or not Director cap. <br />This is the best of both world mixing his art with actors and his special effects. ANd the message at the end is very subtle but clear. Nice work to the re-creator of dinosaurs, and creator of Richard Dryfuss. This is a movie that all should see. Bravo!!!
B00005JKED|1.0|Fooled by Denzel's Academy Award I rented this dismal film.  The plot is ridiculous, but worse still the characters are just not credible.  Ethan Hawke wants a promotion, and to uphold his lawful values, so much so that he smokes dope and drinks booze within hours of commencing his first shift...he has hardly had time for a proper breakfast, and there he is high on PCP, thanks to Uncle Denzel, whom (for some reason) he still adores.  From then on rather than characters there are cliches, including insulting racial stereotypes, nihilistic violence, and repugnantly casual misogyny.  An ugly and horrible film.  Hollywood has entertained us yet again.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|I thought Syriana was an excellent, ambitious, and thought-provoking film. I do agree with the other reviewers that it is a bit hard to follow, and tends to get off-track at times, but if the subject of oil or geopolitics interests you, it is well worth it. Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't see how it was over-hyped, since most people I've mentioned it to have never even heard of it.<br /><br />I thought the film had a ring of authenticity to it, especially since it is loosely based on the memoirs of former CIA agent Robert Baer. As the film goes on, you see the connection between the American and middle eastern governments, oil companies, and Islamic fundamentalists as they come together in a complex web of espionage, business deals, and terrorism. The underlying message is clear, oil makes the world go round.<br /><br />Overall, I thought Syriana was a solid political film. If you are simply looking for a decent action film that doesn't involve a lot of thinking, you will probably be disappointed, but if you don't mind thinking, Syriana is definitely enlightening. Four stars.

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|When I first heard 30 Seconds To Mars I found them to pretty awesome considering Leto being an actor and the band name being after his big movie.  I found an incredible blend of space rock and some 80's pop in there as well making a wonderful mix.  To me there was something missing to me like the band needed to step it up a notch to achieve greatness and become an amazing band.  Well this album does just that.  The murky production found on their debut has been replaced with a very clean and clear production with a more cold feeling.  Its very cold and electronic and the production is amazing.  Leto's voice has gotten a thousand times better and he uses a lot more styles than the previous album showing us the full range of his voice.  Maybe he had some lessons because he has really stepped up on his voice.  This album is soaking with emotion.  I compare it to the same feeling as Marilyn Manson's \\"Mechanical Animals\\" or Placebo \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" is it as good as either???  Time will tell but so far its a contender.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I haven't listened to this cd in a while, but after coming back to it, I'm actually thrown aback about how incredibly excellent it is.  It's not a one-song buy, but instead, every song on the whole album is amazing, it makes me think of Pearl Jam's \\"Ten,\\" because it's just hit after hit.  Man, that's some good stuff.
B00005Y46O|3.0|'Free' ushered in the 1970's as a power-rock trio in the mold of 'Cream', topped off with the powerful voice of frontman Paul Rogers, who would gleen further critical acclaim later in the decade as the voice of 'Bad Company'.  While many of 'Free's compositions are basic blues-rock, the vocal talents of Paul Rogers and the sharply punctuated guitar riffs of Paul Kossoff go a long way towards redeeming most of the selections.  Bassist Andy Fraser teams up with Rogers on most of the composing, and with drummer Simon Kirke to form a sturdy, if unspectacular rhythm section.  The band employed plenty of posturing and strutting to supplement the testosterone laced lyrics and pulsing beats, most of which is well-received as genuine by the British audiences captured here.  At the same time, the absence of stylistic diversity probably spelled out the fate of the band as a one-trick pony in the US more than anything else.  At home in England, however, where the blues was king in the mid-to-late 1960's, the band scored two additional Top Ten and one #13 hit between 1970 and 1973.  Unfortunately, none of these commercially successful tracks are performed on 'Free Live'.  <br /> <br />'Free Live' is composed of thirteen tracks recorded in January of 1970 at the Locarno Ballroom in Sunderland, England, and the 1,500 capacity Fairfield Halls Arts Center in Croydon, England in September of 1970.  In that same month, the band's only Top 40 US release, 'All Right Now', maxed out at number four.  The original vinyl closed with a studio track recorded in March of 1971, the acoustic ballad 'Get Where I Belong', and fittingly this expanded edition of 'Free Live' concludes with a more vibrant and urgent alternate take of the same track.  Sandwiched between are six additional bonus tracks from the Sunderland and Croydon performances.   <br /> <br />The producers of 'Free Live' seem keenly aware of the band's limitations, and provide two versions of three of the best tracks available.  Nothing, of course, matches up with the raw appeal of 'All Right Now', and the Croydon performance aptly demonstrates how the band's interpretation of the song evolved over the course of their touring.  It's such a stunning representation of the power rock epitomized by band's such as Led Zeppelin and Grand Funk Railroad in that same year, that it justifies the price of the disc by itself.  Two versions of 'Mr. Big', a heavy blues-rock number with a fairly catchy basic guitar hook are also offered.  Only on 'Get Where I Belong' does the band diverge significantly from the blues-rock genre, with lyrics focused on repentance and redemption (\\"Help me to repay things I have done wrong, help me find a way to get where I belong\\").  The next nearest thing to diversity is found on the second track, 'I'm a Mover', which might be better described as boogie-rock with guitar lines garnished in psychedelia.  Other than that, the remaining tracks saunter from slow to mid to fast tempo variations on the blues-rock theme.  The longest track is the plodding, bass-driven 'Moonshine', which times out at nearly nine and one-half minutes, while the shortest track is the 3:42 rendition of 'I'm a Mover'.  Both versions of 'All Right Now', the main attraction, are in the six minute range. <br /> <br />This particular version of 'Free Live' comes packaged with a well designed and informative booklet, featuring numerous performance and publicity shots of the band, plenty of details on the individual tracks, and well-composed text detailing the short-lived history of the band.  The recording is as clean and well-defined as any recording I've heard from the era. 'Free' possessed a great deal of heart and attitude, and coupled with Rogers pristine vocals and Kossoff's intense guitar work, this product clamours for a listen even 36 years after the tracks were laid down.  It's not essential, but it is enjoyable.  And of course, turn it up loud for maximum listening pleasure!
B000002IHD|4.0|This is probably Redding's most famous and acclaimed single LP; it's one of only two that Rhino keeps in print domestically at mid-price. (The other is the ubiquitous semi-compilation, DOCK OF THE BAY). Redding's incredible force of personality carries all of his LPs, and they're all quality entertainment, but most of them are erratic. OTIS BLUE is as uneven as any of them but contains a handful of seminal performances. <br /> <br />Side A is much stronger than side B, and contains all of the original material Redding brought to this session. As expected, the three originals are all outstanding. \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\" is a justly famous, dynamic torch ballad; \\"Ole Man Trouble\\" (repeated, perhaps to more poignant effect, on DOCK OF THE BAY) receives a cavernous arrangement, anchored to a dissonant Steve Cropper riff, with lyrics of overwhelming despair. And the version here of \\"Respect\\" is sleeker and punchier than Aretha's, although necessarily it lacks much feminist interest. I prefer it anyway. <br /> <br />There are also three Sam Cooke songs, which suggests that Redding might have had a fuller tribute in mind to the then-recently deceased legend. Otis improves on both \\"Shake\\" and \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" - the latter is skeletal and gut-wrenching, the former gloriously raunchy. (Despite the album's title, Redding's concerns throughout the album are pretty earthy - a lusty blues showcases Cropper on both sides of the LP, although the performances aren't among Redding's most memorable.)  <br /> <br />Side B features a take on \\"Wonderful World\\" that is more radical, but not nearly apt or successful as the late-Cooke pieces on Side A. There's also a perfunctory version of \\"My Girl\\" that, like the two blues, slows the album's momentum and leads me to wonder why this is usually classed as Redding's masterpiece when discs like THE IMMORTAL OTIS REDDING are just sitting there unnoticed. After an odd (but basically reverent) version of \\"Satisfaction\\", complete with fuzz guitar, Redding takes William Bell by the collar and shakes \\"You Don't Miss Your Water\\" free, cutting to the quick just as he did with \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\". His rendering of the immortal soul ballad is as eccentric and indispensible as The Byrds'. <br /> <br />Either three-and-a-half or four stars. DOCK OF THE BAY, which is just as cheap and is, to a certain extent, cobbled together (side B extracts tunes from three previous Redding LPs and one Stax compilation) is probably a better starter.
B000063DIH|3.0|Its real obvious after one listens to this cd, that what has happened to the guys after \\"Somewhere in time\\" is that the success that they found, that they rightly deserved has softened them, and dimmed the great light that they once opened the door way to.     Laziness? more likely seperate lives lived by the band, where they all live in vastly different areas on the Earth with that many different interests is most probably the culprit.    Whatever the case, the guys suck on this one, plain and simple.     be quick or be dead    from here to eternity...they are lucky Bon isnt alive!    Fear of the dark    Judas be my guide? Yea I guess maybe...nothing special thats for sure.. too bad a band with this much potential is playing like sophmores.    Wake up guys we miss the REAL IRON MAIDEN!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I drove from Orgon to see this tour in Canada. What a rush! I have the VHS version of this and it is great to relive the memory. My only concern is the statement \\"Region: Unknown. This item may not be viewable on most DVD players sold in the Region 1 countries (U.S. and Canada)\\" What's up with that? We can buy it but not view it? If someone can set me straight, please do. If you are a Floyd fan, this is the show to watch.

0399245030|5.0|Lost and Found will hopefully win many awards for this touching adventure story with themes of Love and Friendship at its core.<br /><br />A boy befriends a penguin and tries to return him to his home at the South Pole. They bond and enjoy each others' companionship. They never give up on each other, even when they become separated. The boy shows surprising maturity when he realizes he made a mistake leaving the penguin and then goes back to find him. What a great lesson to learn, that it's OK to make a mistake, acknowledge it, then take action to amend it!<br /><br />This story illustrates that it's the Journey, the trip along the way, not necessarily just the destination that gives life meaning and value. Furthermore, the values of friendship, companionship, and sharing come through strongly in this story.<br /><br />This book also taps into classic, timeless themes of finding one's way back home, almost like a kid's version of The Odyssey.<br /><br />The watercolors of the book are spectacular, deep and rich. The drawings have an interesting scale that make the two travelers seem quite heroic.<br /><br />The final reunitement embrace of boy and penguin will melt your heart. What a touching portrait! I challenge the public to find another embrace that is so simple, so pure, so elegant, so Loving.<br /><br />This book is a Treasure!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pulse, was, is and will be, the best concert of all Time! It has been one of my personal favorites, and havent stop whatching it since it came back in 95, on VHS. Now that is going to be on DVD, I cant wait for all the extra material put in it, and the 5.1 dolby sound! <br />I am concer in only one thing, the day it will be release. I have been in various Pink Floyd fan sites, and it said that is coming out till september, so I hope that the date that amazon is releasing this product really  comes out.
B000002U8G|5.0|I'd just like to say that \\"Echoes\\" is Pink Floyd's best song ever. It is the turning point in their trajectory: it is well grounded on their previous work, it signals the path they would follow in the future. Only for this song the album deserves 5 stars. The rest of the songs are good and interesting as well. <br />If you like this album, you shouldn't miss the \\"Live at Pompeii\\" film. <br />Finally, I'd like to propose \\"Echoes\\" as the best pop-rock song ever... Am I saying to much? Well, any other candidates?
B000EWBKM6|3.0|I didn't really care for the finale.  It was cute but also kind of lame.  I think they (the writers) could've done a little better.  It hurt to see two really good friends lose touch over several years.  I know it happens all the time but it's just my opinion.
B000EULJLU|5.0|2 rating systems i say because you need 1 to rate the album vs the rest of the music industry and 1 to rate the album vs other albums the band has released.<br /><br />I have listened to Tool since Undertow when that baseline from sober cought my attention.  Haven't really stopped listening since.<br /><br />First off, like the other albums Tool has put out i thought it was great, especially when compaired to 98 percent of the other albums being released by other musicians.  I mean, I would rather listen to a bad Tool album then a good Korn album and the like.  With that being said I have to comment that this is by far Tool's worst album as far as I'm concerned.  You see, the music is great, but its got way too much filler, I would have rather bought a short album then one filled with low quality filler junk.  The 6 or 7 actuall songs that are on this album are incredible however.<br /><br />I think that Tools best album is also their biggest problem.  Aenema was great from beginning to end and needed no filler, but because it was so good and such a step up from their previous albums it lead you to believe this was a group who's talent was being sharpened, and who's musical style was developing still.  10,000 days is worth the buy, but just like being a Pink Floyd fan, comparing all their albums to \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", I feel Tool fans are always gonna compair any Tool release to \\"Aenema\\" and be dissapointed, no matter how good the albums are.
B000AL730O|4.0|I'm a big McCartney fan and have been for many years. But in recent years I think his albums have been enjoyable but maybe a little over hyped (how many times has the phrase \\"his best since the Beatles\\" been bandied about?). So, I was looking forward to the release of 'Chaos..'but had a few reservations.  <br /> <br />The choice of Nigel Godrich as producer I thought was a bold move, but I wasn't sure whether the end result would sound more like a Godrich album than a McCartney album. <br /> <br />What the album does sound like is 63 year old Paul McCartney. And that is a good thing. What I think you can feel while listening to this album is McCartney being totally himself. His voice sounds more mature, vunerable, his subjects are a little more weighty and his art has benefitted from it.  <br /> <br />The decision to allow Paul to play the lion's share of the instruments himself was a masterstroke by Godrich. This I think is where Paul gets in the zone and does his best work. No uneccessary fancy guest performers, no overblown orchestral scores, just Paul..pure and simple. <br /> <br />Of course, the sweet McCartney melodies are all present. But they are arranged in such a way that gives them an edge and makes them interesting to listen to again and again, without them becoming sickly and cloying.   <br /> <br />There are no bad tracks on this album. My favourite however is 'How Kind Of You' a touching song of vunerablity with some beautiful instrumental work towards the end, perfect.  <br /> <br />The whole album is close to perfect. <br />
0399245030|5.0|This is the first children's book I have purchased since I was a kid (which was not long ago!) The adorable penguin on the cover caught my attention, but the illustrations and sweet story blew me away. I am so impressed with Mr. Jeffer's book, I had to write a quick review.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to people of all ages - young kids will understand the story and older kids and adults can appreciate the artwork. His illustrations are fantastic and the subtle humor of the artwork can be enjoyed by everyone. A must for children's books fans, artists and adults in need of a new book for their kids!
B000EMGAGW|4.0|I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST BUT AFTER REVIEWING THE ALBUM, I DEFINATLY CAN BUMP IT FROM TIME TO TIME. PEARLY GATES WAS MY FAVORITE TRACK, SLICK AND COOL FLOW.  MOBB DEEP, IN MY OPINION WON'T EVER COME BACK HARD LIKE THEY USE TO BE, BUT IF HAVOC GOES SOLO ON HIS OWN ALBUM, G=UNIT OR NOT, IT WILL DEFINATLY SHAKE THE HIP HOP WORLD. GO ON AND GET YOURS HAV ITS YOUR TURN.<br /><br />yours trully, JAY TERRA!
B00002E23E|3.0|For decades we've seen this movie. We know it as the back of our hands. You already done a fantastic piece of work by releasing the essential Led Zeppelin DVD Box Set. <br /> <br />Having found the Madison Square Garden tapes (that's undeniable because of the previously unseen footage on the 2 DVD Box Set) my question is simple: <br /> <br />WHERE IS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT?. <br /> <br />I can't believe this is a copy-paste DVD from the VHS we already have. Why not the uncut footage instead?. We've seen the filming scenes... and we don't like them, face it my friend. All that stuff is just pointless, filler, pathetic. I give this 3 star just for the concert alone and the parts we can see the band playing. <br /> <br />Its so annoying not to be able to see John's keyboard solo Paul on Not Quarter, or Bonzo's quintessential solo on Moby Dick, the interpretacion of Dazed And Confuzed, Rain Song, etc.  <br /> <br />Easily the most memorable, viewed and  recalled part of the whole film is Stairway To Heaven... not only for the song but it appears complete without any scenes interruption!. <br /> <br />Moreover, even we can't have the complete version of Heartbreaker, and it's probably that also exist Celebration Day.   <br /> <br />It's about time that you make justice to this document of the history of the music, truly, we are tired of waiting. <br /> <br />PLEASE, LET IT HAPPEN, AT LEAST IN THE NAME OF BONZO. <br /> <br />MERCI <br /> <br />
B00006IU73|5.0|This was my first exposure to PT.  Ran across several references to them in other reviews of prog music here on Amazon, so I decided to give (album title) a listen and one-clicked a copy to try out.  First thing I have to say I noticed about the disc was the recording quality.  It is PRISTINE and crystal clear.  Not sure what Steve Wilson and/or his recording engineer did while recording this to make it sound so good, but hats off to them for pulling it off.  This is one of the best sounding CDs I've bought in the last decade.  Second thing that struck me was, while I very much enjoyed the music, it didn't necessarily strike me as being obvious prog-rock.  Rock, yes.  Prog, sort of.  I admit my definition of progressive rock is more defined by the 70's prog sound, and PT reminds me more of early 80's Triumph, Rush or Blue Oyster Cult (peppered with a touch of 90's grunge) than 70's Yes, Genesis, or ELP.  The use of heavier electric guitars layered with some feathery strummed acoustic reminded me of Triumph (or the like) quite a bit.  But is it good music?  Oh yeah...the team Steve Wilson put together consists of solid musicians, and they deliver on here, pulling out powerful performances of his material.  Another aspect of PT I really like are the vocals.  I've moaned in several other reviews about the vocalists in a few other prog bands, and I was pleasantly surprised with Wilson's voice.  He tends to sing in a lower register than a lot of Dream Theatre-inspired prog outfits, and it's a nice change.  I think it better relates the more personal-sounding lyrics Wilson tends to write.  Though I'm not a hard rock fanatic, I tend to like the harder rocking tunes on this.  The ethereal-sounding, slower numbers sound great (production wise) but don't really carry the energy the harder numbers do (the slower songs come across a little more emotionally heavy).  And don't expect any massive B3 or moog solos or any other prog rock keyboard staples.  All the keyboard work is very subtle and textural, flavoring the music much more than leading it.  <br /> <br />Though some of the songs are less than 5s (the slower, keyboard driven numbers for me), the disc as a whole is a work of art for production and musicianship. <br /> <br />So, if you like prog-ish rock with good energy and a darker mood, this is definitely one to consider. <br />
B00005JNEI|4.0|Five things struck me about this film that have stayed with me:<br /><br />1) President Bush's almost sphinx-like reaction to the news of the terrorist attack on 09/11;<br /><br />2) his weekend at the ranch clearing brush appearing as the common man's man while ignoring the August 6th memo that announced al-Qaeda was going to attempt an attack against the United States using airplanes;<br /><br />3) telling reporters (and forgive me, if I don't have it completely right) \\"I think it's important that we all fight against terrorism.\\" Then, he segues to \\"Now watch this shot.\\" as he steps up to the tee.<br /><br />4) the mother who lost her son in Iraq;<br /><br />5) The military targeting the poor for recruiting.<br /><br />The first image of President Bush in the classroom gives him the appearance of a clueless Captain Queeg who simply does not know what to do. That is not how I want our leader to react in a time of imminent crisis.<br /><br />The second image of our president at his ranch where he has spent 40% of his presidency suggests that the August 6th memo was not given its proper attention. No matter what spin neo con talk show radio hacks may want to say about Clinton, no one can seriously say that this president did not have the information to do something, to take some action other than standing in front of his pick-up and clear brush. As a reminder of how clueless this administration was, Condoleeza Rice was still promoting an upgraded nuclear ballistic missile system, and the attorney general, John Ashcroft placed terrorism under drug interdiction on his priority tree. That's how clueless these people were.<br /><br />The president talking about getting everyone to fight terrorism and then blithely segueing into, \\"Now watch this shot,\\" suggests that his prior comments were almost reflexive and insincere. It isn't appropriate to say, \\"Now watch this shot!\\" right after discussing terrorism.<br /><br />While filming the mother who lost a son in Iraq may seem to be a cheap shot at gaining sympathy, it does send another important message: this mother and other Americans who speak out against the war are patriots, far more so than the people who attempt to brand them as traitors.<br /><br />Moore makes an excellent point here about how the poor are so actively recruited for the military while congress keeps their sons and daughters out of harm's way, but are quite willing to send the children of others into harm's way. This is a very old tradition. The president was even the beneficiary of it, receiving a direct commission he did not have to earn, and being jumped over 600 other personnel waiting on the list for the Texas Air National Guard.<br /><br />I gave this only four stars because Spinsanity was able to find a number of misdirections and false impressions under Michael Moore's direction.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an important film worth seeing or purchasing.<br /><br />P.S. Some have called Michael Moore a hypocrite for having made a ton of money, and having put some of it in tax shelters. Three questions come to mind: So, what? Is he supposed to be poor, or something?

B000068PQ0|5.0|I know this album has been out for a while but thought I would drop a review anyway.  As I was brushing my teeth and pondering a little I really realized that this is in the top 5 albums I have ever heard in my life. Even after having it for a few years and having listened to a lot of great music, it is still in my top 5.  Hope that helps.
B000002ADT|5.0|If you find most jazz to be too busy, too fast, too sonically dense and not melodic enough to suit your taste, I think you'll find this classic a very pleasant surprise. It has space, it has unforgettable melodies- it is quite simply a subtle gem of the jazz genre. Miles Davis assembled a band of jazz gods including John Coltrane, \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley and Bill Evans. Jimmy Cobb, Paul Chambers and Wynton Kelly round out the ensemble. Mr. Davis provided the band with the frameworks in which they could improvise and off they went to create this gorgeous work. I can't stress enough how peaceful and laid back this music sounds. It's a far cry from Miles' later experiments in jazz fusion (see \\"Bitches Brew\\") and indeed most of the subgenres of jazz.<br /><br />If you love this album like I do, you might also enjoy Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\", Dave Brubeck's \\"Time Out\\" and Charles Mingus' \\"Mingus Ah Um\\". You might also want to check out the artists on the ECM label for examples of more contemporary subtle, spacious jazz but \\"Kind of Blue\\" is number one on my list of terrific jazz albums. Dig that mellow vibe!
0451212088|4.0|25 years after its first edition, this book is still topical. It takes its readers into a violence and explosive world of espionage, alternated with love, passion, desire, hate, confidence/faith and deception. This book is certainly a compulsive and satisfying piece of art.
0385495315|5.0|As someone who reads technical writing both for a living and for fun, I have to say that this book is perhaps the very best example of technical writing I've ever seen. Singh is able to explain some fairly complicated mathematics to the lay audience beautifully, and weave in great stories all the way through.
B000F48CD8|5.0|I must say I LOVE this band.  This album is amazing. I had not heard of the Raconteurs before, (or the people in it, i must be a bad person :0), but I did when the online itunes music store made \\"steady, as she goes (aucustic)\\" an itunes free download. Noticing that was the best thing music wise that might have happened to me this year. <br /> <br />The Raconteurs is a truly unique band.  I love every song on the Cd, so it definitely was a good buy.  Every song the CD is just about a different genre from eachother, so it pleases every one.  To be able to perform every genre perfectly means that this band has got talent. <br /> <br />variety=good. that way you don't have to listen to crazy boy-band pop music on every song like 'NSYNC does or the BackstreetBoys. Thank god for that. <br /> <br />I think it took some finding, but I actually found a good band nowadays that isnt a boyband or that curses in every song.  Or ANY song for that matter.  Not that there's something wrong with that, but I personally prefer guilt-free music. <br /> <br />In conclusion, you should buy this album, because it is amazing. It has music for everybody on it. Don't be scared off by the scary coverart ;-) <br /> <br /> <br />The Raconteurs=pure goodness
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|when a piece of an alien ship lands on the head of the main character in the movie, he frantically screams and yells and rings a bell that frightens everybody. When he has everyone's attention he shows them the \\"Piece of the sky that fell on my head,\\" only to rudelly realize, it's not there anymore. Then an acorn flalls on his head, and everything just crumbles from there for the little guy.  <br /> <br />Don't be fooled by the cast, When watching you can barly pick out anyone [except of course the main chracters and Don knotts, the turkey]. I didnt even know Patrick stewart was ion the movie till i read the cast and credits... online.  <br />The story line gets a bit redundent and is very predictable. It ends up being a \\"War of the worlds\\" look alike, only it's kid friendly, so no one dies. There are a few jokes that are amusing, but the storyline is just not that good, and the jokes don't revive it. In fact, if it weren't for the character Fish, this movie would not be funny at all.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, for any 5 - 7 year olds, this movie has the formula for a good buy. Action, a simple plotline, a few scenes where cumunication is seen in a good light, throw in a few scary scenes at the end, add an unlikly hero and... you have what disney has been doing for years... only with Chicken little, they got a little lazy, and made the plot a little too simple, repedative, forseeable, and again if it werent for fish, id take off yet another star. <br />Some people may be offended by the many derogitory jokes cracked in this mvie. However keep in mind the person who does them is not exacally an angel herself and is protrayed as a \\"Bad person.\\" The jokes are generic, but to some kids, it may just slip out one of these days... Not that that can be avoided.  <br /> <br />I give it two stars for its nice, and easy to follow storyline, and Fish.  <br />Everything else is just a bit... repedative. After the first 300 seconds of movie watching, you can already predict the ending. Fish adds the spice to the movie, if it werent for him, it just wouldnt be worth watching.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005OMTT|5.0|If you don't know what the sound of Enigma is all about, this album is all you need. I couldn't have chosen a better list. Because the album is nice and long, it's perfect for leaving in the player along with other dark, ethereal favorites for some reflective or creative alone time.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers career can be broken down into 3 distinct segments--the original band with John Frusciante, the \\"Our lead guitarist this week is .....\\" phase and the current Frusciante restoration phase.   <br /> <br />The first phase was characterized by powerful music that forced alternative into the mainstream consciousness.  The albums were uneven, with considerable material that can most charitably be characterized as \\"filler\\", but the masterworks were so powerful one had to have them and resign onself to liberal use of the \\"seek' function on ones stero.  The middle phase is best forgotten.  With the restoration of Frusciante to the band, the Peppers were once again a force to be dealt with. <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium is a bit of a departure.  Californication, the first element of the restoration period was more in line with the 1st phase--powerful music spaced with filler.  With By the Way the Peppers achieved the ultimate--a perfect album, where every single track was worth listening to and the whole was far greater than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br />This effort lies somewhere in between.  The synergy and cohesiveness of By the Way are not as present in this album.  The lushness and resonance of that effort have given way to a more spare, cleaner sound on this album.  This work, encompassing two discs, is more fragmented and less driven than the last effort.  And, this effort is a more rhythm than melody based composition. <br /> <br />It is, however, all those facts notwithstanding, an extraordinary album.  The lyrics are more nuanced and comprehensible here.  The music more controlled and articulated.  The energy level remains the high octane explosion one expects from the Peppers.  If this album is somewhat devoid of the monster Top 20 type hit, it is nevertheless heavily populated by accessible and memorable tracks. <br /> <br />The Peppers history has been one characterized largely by chaos and extremism.  Frusciante's survival of his nearly fatal herion addiction and the sheer inertia of age has combined to soften the sound and lend a more mature, introspective aspect to their music.  In other words, the Peppers are evolving--and, happily, evolving to a much higher level musically, harmonically and intellectually.  We are all better off for the change. <br />
6302453356|5.0|The action and character development in this unusual take on the popular story make for a creative piece of family entertainment. Not your run-of-the-mill fantasy, Hook pulls a modern-day Peter Pan from reality and sends him far from home for a unique adventure. You have to travel outside the box with the writers and director, but there's fun to be had. The all-star cast gave top performances and the action was non-stop. My video library includes mostly documentaries, independent and foreign films. But everyone's got to have some fluff in their life. Come on Terrence (The New Yorker), open your mind!
630469654X|4.0|I'm giving this movie 4 stars.  If it wasn't for the musical score it would have 5.  I first saw this movie in the late 80s? and I like it as much now as I did then.  In fact, for years if you wanted to watch an enjoyable medeval movie, you were limited to this and a small handful of others (nice to see that times have changed). This movie is really timeless with the exception of the score which dates it immediately.  As someone in a previous review mentioned it would be great if they would release the movie as a special edition without the tacky '80s soundtrack.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Several versions of Peter Pan's adventures swim the cinematic sea, but this one has to be the best. With a plot that's total fantasy, this film takes you into Neverland and makes you a believer in everything you see. Acting, directing, editing, writing and special effects are superb. You won't be disappointed.
B000EMGAGW|3.0|I am a huge Mobb Deep fan and a 50 Cent fan, although the fact that his songs sound good is about the extent of my admiration. <br />This latest disc has its moments, but it is short on tracks, even with the recycled bonus tracks that everyone downloaded 6 months ago.   <br />And then, only about half the songs are worth listening to more than once.  50 drops a couple good hooks, and even some hardcore verses with those little hood-details that made him a hit on Get Rich or Die Tryin.  Havoc and Prodigy, on the other hand, spit repetative lines about shooting people and everyone being jealous.  I mean, I know Mobb Deep is KNOWN for some hard-core, grimy type ish, but you gotta switch up the flow every now and then, come on! <br />Production wise, there are some really hot beats on this album.  G-Unit releases always seem to have the best beats around, which keeps their albums afloat no matter what.  Alchemist and Dre laid down some killer instrumentals this time around.   <br />Overall, worth burning from someone and listening to a few times.  Save your money for when the Busta CD drops.
1400079179|1.0|This rating system doesn't have an option for a \\"no star\\" because it doesn't deserve it. I wasnt surprised when I heard this book was going to be published because if you are a true christian you wouldn't believe one bit of information it tells you. This book confuses christian believers and make them think twice about whether their belief is true or false? People these days will come from every corner to lure you into their stories and believe that they hold the truth and evidence for christianity beliefs. I for one, am a true christian and I will stick to what I believe and that is Jesus Christ, Is-Have Been-And Forevermore will be the Son of God, the Beginning and the End, the Alpha and the Omega, the Life, the Truth, and the Way.
0743454537|5.0|I LOVED, LOVED this book.  This was the first book of Picoult's that I've read & I can't wait to read more of her.  I knew within the first few pages that this was a different type of writing style.  She weaves a story by telling it from all the characters' perspectives.  A heart-wrentching tale about a family illness & the lengths your loved ones will go to save you.  All the characters seem true-to-life & their struggles believable.  Sit down with a box of kleenex & a glass of wine (you'll need both!)
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Oh where oh where has good horror gone, oh where oh where can it be! From the moment I rented this piece of s*it movie, I was on the edge of my seat, waiting for something that never came. All the cross talk I heard about this film had built me up for something that was supposed to be scary and gory as hell. The only thing this film had in it was two little moments of humor when one of the two ugly b*tches from the club gets ran over by the car, and the oriental girl throws herself in front of the train. When I rent a horror movie, I expect more than a couple of laughs. Hell High Tension was better than this, the end was f#cking stupid, but I enjoyed it allot more.<br /><br /> Have people grown so \\"sensitive\\" that they are now horrified by anything. Was Bambi Two straight to video because it was \\"too hot for theaters?\\" I saw more horror in Nightmare on Elm Street, more gore in Day of the Dead. I cry when I watch horror now. It's not that I have an over abundance of compassion for the characters, it's just too painful to watch a genre that I love going straight to hell. For decades, horror movies had balls, and then, to my surprise, one of the grandfathers of modern horror, Wes Craven himself, made Scream, and nothing has ever been the same since.<br /><br /> This movie will chill you if your one of the millions of brain dead zombies that thought the world of Scream,  Saw Two, (or One for that matter), or any of the countless other mindless horror movies made over the last fifteen or so years. For anyone who wants to see real terror, rent I Spit on Your Grave, or Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, and feel the pain.
1400079179|2.0|I read the book several years ago soon after publication and before all the hype and hoopla. The theories Brown presents are intriguing and thought provoking and are the only reason I managed to finish the book. However, I was very bored with the sophomoric writing style, the flat one-dimensional characters and the way the events just fell into place, very scripted. But to give credit where credit is due, Brown was did a good job of weaving the \\"theories\\" into the story other than that, the book lacked depth.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I agree people need to listen to the \\"Mars\\" portion of this album to really appreciate what Red Hot Chili Peppers wrote for this double-disk album.  However, I'm really appreciative of this album for another reason. <br /> <br />RHCP tried to revive an old way of writing an album.  You may notice that the same melodic theme comes up quite a few times along with repeating chord progressions.  This type of album writing can be seen in artists like Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan, King Crimson or even classical era composers like Bach, Mozart, or Handel in his oratorios.  It was used as a way to tell a story using intertwining/reocurring melodies to tell it. <br /> <br />It may seem repetitive but it is a form of art.  Agreed, RHCP could have explored and diversified the songs a tad more because they do sound a bit too much like the one before, but all in all they did a good job reviving an old artform. <br /> <br />I firmly believe this will become one of those albums we will all see on VH1 some day and an album that the next generation of kids will go and buy like Dark Side of the Moon or Highway 61 Revisited (but certainly not to that extent).  It is definitely an album everyone should try listening all the way through to.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|Ten year old fatherless Elliot has the ideal friend in the harmless little extraterrestial E.T. who has been left inadverentely behind by his spaceship. E. T. gets to know Elliot's brother and sister and in effect becomes a member of the family. The real heart- jerking comes when E.T. dies, and is then at hearing from his own Civilization, resurrected. This special little cinematic miracle works wonders on the viewers heart, and the movie has a moving and inspiring ending.<br /><br />Sentimental, it may be. But strangely moving also. A masterfully done movie , still tremendously popular and by now a film classic.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's second album deserved all the commercial and critical success it achieved, it managed to strike the right balance between their stripped down intimate debut album 'Parachutes' and the anthemic melancholy of the follow up album 'X & Y'. 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head' is dominated by piano-based ballad's which the band excel at and is preferable to the layer's of keyboard's and synths that feature heavily on 'X & Y' (a strong album but definitely over-produced!).<br />I've never been particularly impressed by Chris Martin's lyrics but he get's away with it as he sings with a genuine humanity and passion that is gripping and heartwarming and he's on his best form here. Johnny Buckland play's a subtle role on this album, the guitar's are almost non-existent compared to his playing on 'Parachutes' but they are there when the song's demand them and they serve their role well.<br />'Clocks' is one of those rare songs that has been played to death on radio and television but has never grated on me- in fact, I love 'Clocks' just that little bit more everytime I hear it. The piano riff, Will Champion's drums and Guy Berryman's pulsating bassline help to drive along a song which ranks as my absolute favourite Coldplay tune.<br />'Amsterdam' is a very close second to 'Clocks', it's my favourite closing track to any album I've ever heard and I hope Coldplay don't abandon songs like this in future, whatever direction they choose to take because they are master's of the slow-building piano ballad and 'Amsterdam' is their best effort in that style. 'The Scientist' almost matches it.<br />'In My Place' has a gorgeous tune and is one of their best singles, I've always preferred it over 'Yellow'. 'Daylight' and 'A Whisper' are a couple of my other favourite's from this album.<br />A lot of similar band's have since tried to make an album as consistently strong and emotional as 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head' but none have matched it.
068485743X|5.0|Having collected many slush- pile rejections in my time it was interesting for me to read a bit of what was actually going on on the other side. The obvious fact that a sloppily presented manuscript is readily rejected is one I admit I probably never have completely learned. At Cornell the late David Novarr taught us 'Sloppy punctuation makes for sloppy thought' and this seems to be one of Lukeman's fundamental insights.<br /><br />He goes on to give a number of reasons why manuscripts are readily rejected, including excessive use of modifiers, and wooden trite dialogue.<br /><br />He in fact goes through the stages at which a manuscript is conceivably read pointing out grounds for rejection at each stage.<br /><br />At my age I do not know how much of all of this can be of use to me. But my guess is much of it will be of use to fledgling writers.<br /><br />I think his point about writers' need to devote time to researching the appropriate possible agent for their kind of material, makes a lot of sense. Looking at acknowledgments in books of similar subjects is clearly one way. Finding out from people who might be in the know , if one knows anyone in the know is another. Clearly indicating a knowledge of the Agent's previous work is a way of opening the heart, and perhaps the door a bit.<br /><br />This is a good guide which hopefully will be of use to some of its readers.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|(2005) What a pleasant surprise. Elijah Wood's best role since the \\"Lord Of The Rings's\\" Frodo. Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a young Jewish American who wants to discover his past - and say a special thank you to the woman who helped save his grandfather during the Nazi invasion during WWII. And so Jonathan's European road trip begins. Foer is somewhat neurotic - tagging and bagging life's souvenirs to his bedroom wall. Foer departs the train to find his tour guides... an odd pair, a mid 20-something hipster and his grandfather... and the real journey begins. Both guides are extremely funny at times. Unknown actors to me playing the younger tour guide (Eugene Hutz) and the witty grandfather (Boris Leskin)... not to mention the dog - the \\"official seeing eye [...]\\" by the name of Sammy Davis Junior, Junior. The cinemaphotography is beautiful as Foer is taken through the many rolling hills and small quaint towns. The storyline engrossing; the dialogue sharp; the character's creating empathy; the dog acting cute as can be and barking on queue; the ending fulfilling. I did not read the book, but the movie makes me want to now. A great movie with some truly wonderful messages.
B000002J09|1.0|Wow: I can't believe people love Led Zeppelin so much as the singer can't sing because I hear them all the time on the radio and they are annoying. And plus, this is one of the worst albums yet containing two of the worst songs in Black dog, and Misty Mountain I have ever heard. The only decent song on this album is Stairway to Heaven which makes me a little sad. But the rest sucks. Avoid the 5 star reviewers for this album and all the other overrated Led Zeppelin (with the exception of Physical Graffiti) and anything else by The Rolling Stones, The Who, and The Beatles because all those bands are trash and are for Babies.<br /><br />Go get Nirvana Nevermind and any Guns N' Roses CD insted.
B000E33VWW|4.0|If you are on a march to view the majority of critically acclaimed movies of 2005, well your march will no doubt see you watching \\"Capote,\\" along the way.<br /><br />There seems to be too much space in, \\"Capote,\\" too much time.  The film matches a Kansas landscape, sparse and vacant.  No doubt Phillip Seymour Hoffman turns in a remarkably understated performance as writer Truman Capote goes through an exhaustive 6 year creative process to write \\"In Cold Blood.\\"  Whereas, \\"Walk the Line,\\" draws you into the persona of Johnny Cash and gets you excited to learn more, director Bennet Miller's biopic falls short.<br /><br />Taking this criticism in stride, \\"Capote,\\" is very much a worthwhile movie to spend your time viewing.  The juxtaposition of Capote, the twisted soul writer, and Perry Smith, the twisted soul killer, reveals the thin line between people who follow different paths in life.  Capote is drawn in to the humanity of a rightfully convicted killer and finds himself shattered in the process.  Tortured souls do create good art though.<br /><br />\\"Capote,\\" could have been more.  We could have gotten under the skin of Truman and revealed complexities barely explored, barely scratched.  Don't expect, \\"Capote,\\" to gain lofty heights on your top ten list but do watch it for Hoffman's performance of a complicated man.<br /><br />--MMW
B00002E233|1.0|Caution: This review contains a couple spoilers! <br /> <br />First off, I have to admit that my husband and I ended up seeing this by accident, when flipping through channels. What is not accidental (and is patently inexcusable, in my opinion) is the sheer awfulness of this movie. It was so bad it was funny, and for that reason alone we watched it for the (surely unintended) comedy.   <br /> <br />The movie is rife with stock and unoriginal characters: whiny useless blonde woman, who can only stand there and scream at critical junctures (almost as vexing as those young women in horror flicks who are running for their lives but always trip and/or fall down), sexy young doctor/bimbo character (I guess she finished that pesky PhD while still in high school), buff blonde himbo (no, that's not a typo, he's just the male surfer version of the bimbo), and a couple of token minorities, one of whom gives preachy pep talks (we actually cheered when in the midst of Jackson's character's \\"we must pull together as a team to survive\\" rah-rah speech, a shark surfaced and gulped him down raw). Yummy. Mr. Shark doesn't fancy that sanctimonious claptrap anymore than we did. <br /> <br />Most amusing scene: bimbo scientist feels it necessary to strip off her wetsuit before she kills a shark, and after all the drama and suspense of the impromptu strip-tease we see she's wearing sensible white undies rather than Victoria's Secret. Aww, what a disappointment. But I guess good girls don't go to heaven if they wear naughty underwear.  <br /> <br />More things we picked up on: whenever a character cusses, drinks, smokes, or looks at porn, something terrible happens. Evil shark suddenly appears and punishes said sinner. Hardly subtle. (For example, one guy lights up a cigarette and seconds later loses a hand - hubby said this was the best anti-smoking campaign ad ever!) There are probably more than a dozen references to God throughout this film, which in itself is not objectionable, but becomes obvious and annoying after more than a couple times. There's even a \\"group hug\\" scene where all the characters join hands in a circle and pray. What is this, the 700 Club? Not to mention a shark gets stabbed with a crucifix in the end. Spare us the lofty moral overtones and get on with the story already. Oh wait, that would require a plot, wouldn't it?   <br /> <br />A lot of people have been comparing this movie to \\"Jaws.\\" I'm not sure what they've been smoking (careful there, might lose a hand!;), but the only thing this joke of a film has in common with \\"Jaws\\" is the CGI effects might as well date from the 70s. There's no excuse for a 1999 film to have CGI so terribly bad that it's just plain embarrassing after awhile. Cast should have done shadow-puppets on a wall instead - I think it would have been scarier. More entertaining, too. <br /> <br />This movie is so predictable, so corny, and so appallingly bad that I wonder if the actors even dare list it on their resumes.
0446310786|5.0|I read this book over the course of 2 months. It is just beautifully well-written. No wonder it's a classic! It has humor, a strong climax, well-described characters with each adding a key part to the novel. However, it gives no useful advice on killing mockingbirds. Okay seriously, I HIGHLY recommend this book. Well done.
0385336691|5.0|Edward Lane made his millions brokering deals for mercenaries, but now needs to hire one for personal reasons before dj vu occurs.  Someone has kidnapped Edward's second wife Kate and demands he hand over a million dollars for her safe return.This is just like what happened to his first spouse, Anne, who was abducted but killed.  Knowing the mercenary traffic, Edward hires the man he considers the best, loner Jack Reacher to go after the kidnappers once his wife is safely returned to him.<br /><br />In a caf in Manhattan Reacher watches a parked Mercedes with the million dollars that Edward placed inside of it until someone drives off with the vehicle.  Reacher, with the help of former FBI Agent turned private investigator Lauren Pauling, who worked the first Lane tragedy, follows a particular nasty kidnapper.  However, this time his uncanny instincts fail him as he makes errors based on assumptions that prove false.  Now the former military police officer turned vigilante for hire realizes he has to expedite himself out of a dangerous trap and that he has ONE SHOT to do so.<br /><br />This reviewer has always been a fan of the Reacher series, but in the HARD WAY, he seems less the invincible superman and more the error prone human.  The premise that he starts off with a wrong assumption that leads to mistakes embellishes the typical high level of suspense as the audience wonders if the hero will survive as he does not seem to know Jack about what is going on.  Lee Child more than just refreshes his series; he widens the scope without changing the essence of his champion mercenary.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0618477942|5.0|Fun house is a spectacular achievement.  Deeply moving, sophisticated and stunning.  I read it in one, thrilling, session. I can't recommend it highly enough.   <br /> <br />Gail Leondar-Wright
B00005JOYA|5.0|It seems that there were two kinds of people, those who hated Silent Hill before even seeing it, and those who couldn't wait to see a film adaptation of their fave video game. Guess which group is probably eating it's hat...<br /><br />I actually was dragged against my will, and guess what? I loved it.<br /><br />It's a slickly done, beautifully shot thrill-show, and it delivers the goods. The excellent music score alone was worth the ticket price.<br /><br />While not exactly cinematic art, it's a well-done popcorn movie, with a perfect, haunting ending. It's been among the nation's top ten films for 5 weeks straight, so apparently word of mouth was better than the nay-sayers predicted.
1580084621|5.0|I have been cooking Thai food on a semi-profesional level for more than 15 years. Teaching Thai cooking, running a Thai chef service and cooking for family and friends. I have taken private cooking lessons with chefs in Thailand and I am addicted to both the culture and food of this beautiful country.     When I got David Thomson's book for my birthday, I was both very happy and very sad. Happy, because I had finally found the ultimate Thai cookbook. A book that reads like a blend between a dictionary, history book and fantastic cook book. Sad, because at the moment I opened the first page I knew that my dream of writing a Thai cookbook had come to an end. There is nothing more to be said or written. David Thomson has done it. I recommend this book to all people serious about Thai cooking.
B000B19BCG|4.0|Not your typical Supergrass album in that there isn't really a standout, radio single on the album. This is more of a Sunday morning / 'road' trip through the countryside album that has the group maturing their sound and showing their musical talents in a subtle but easy to embrace sound. If you are looking for a catchy, danceable song; the first song might entice you. Parts of the song have a little bit of a Franz Ferdinand sound. And \\"Coffee In The Pot\\" has a silly, happy-go lucky Russian wedding ditty feel to it that only Supergrass could pull off. But for the most part `Road To Rouen' is a smooth, somewhat moody album that might take a few listens to warm up to. The warmth is worth the wait though.
B000002P6R|2.0|Face Dances should have never been made.  Townshend, the Who's chief songwriter, put all his best post-Moon material on Empty Glass, leaving table scraps for this album.<br /><br />The music is pop-synth oriented, uninspired and bloody boring.  \\"Don't Let Go the Coat\\" and \\"Cache Cache\\" (\\"...there ain't no bears in there, cache cache...\\" huh?) are embarrasing.  Other than \\"You Better You Bet,\\" the songs are forgetful at best.<br /><br />Poor Kenny Jones has been the target of Who fan anger for 25 years, but this lackluster album was not his fault.  He was just the drummer.  Face Dances is lousy because of the songwriting, not the drumming.<br /><br />As a live act, the Who was good enough with Mr. Jones on the skins, and it makes sense that they tried to jump start their careers with him.  Understandably, the band was shaken after Keith's death, but why even bother putting out new material this bad?  At least the next Who mach II album, It's Hard, had some great songs.<br /><br />Even with the bonus tracks, Face Dances is a bargain bin album.  Don't waste your money on this; go out and get Empty Glass, All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes and It's Hard.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album takes lots of time, way more time than Lateralus even...Songs that sound second rate at first eventually become masterpieces. Been a fan since 1993 and I can say this is up there with Aenima as their best work. An improvement from Lateralus (which was outstanding as well)...This album is amazing, the six actual songs are very complex and intricate, they only reveal their secrets after multiple and careful listenings...But, oh, is it worth it. And the five interludes/segues are also brilliant and vital to the album...Again, they also take time but eventually it all comes together and it is beautiful and stunning. This is Tool in top form...

067182449X|4.0|Anne Frank- The Diary of a Young Girl is an inspiring and uplifting story during which not only readers learn about the circumstances and events of the time of World War II, but gain insights into the true meaning of life from a teenage girl opening up her heart to her diary. She changes the meaning of life and happiness while hiding in a warehous for more than two years. She dramatically changes from a girl to a young woman who falls in love, is extremely independent, and finds happiness in the darkest of situations. Although the middle of the diary is a little dry, her story is still amazing and keeps readers' attention, especially as her deepest thoughts, feelings, hopes, and dreams are poured out. Particularly when she says that she wants to remain alive even after she's dead, readers know that this girl is special. Finally, her diary ends, as she is finally found and set to a concentration camp; yet her dream came true because she is still alive in all of us deep down today.
1400079179|3.0|This is the type of novel that is best read before the hype, considering once you read it after the hype, it becomes entirely an act of sorting through other people's thoughts and arguments about what it becomes in the end and \\"choosing a side, so to speak.\\"  So when approaching this novel so controversial in quality, I speak only of my responses to others' arguments, ones obtained without even searching or asking for them.<br /><br />So I will begin with the now pop-lore level overview of the book: a \\"symbologist\\" named Robert Langdon is called to investigate a murder at the Louvre, and he doesn't know why.  Half-an-hour, a new female friend (to quote Monty python: \\"Hint hint nudge nudge wink wink say no more, say no more), and a bunch of enemies later, Langdon is in a race to uncover a multigenerational, internation conspiracy involving a lot of Da Vinci, a lot of Christian analysis, and quite a lot of allusions to the idea that maybe the Catholic church ain't so benevolent an institution.<br /><br />In general it's a pretty engaging thriller, interesting and keeps up a fast, fun pace.  If it wasn't nearly as famous, I'd go as far as to say it'd be pretty much liked by everyone who found it.  If it less-than-popular, it would be a cult classic that was \\"underminded by the status quo\\" and kept out of the limelight because of the controversial ideas it presents.<br /><br />Instead, it's rather famous, with all of the angry fundamentalist Christians saying it shouldn't exist out there necessary to code it deep within our souls that this novel MIGHT BE SAYIN' SOMETHIN'!  Goodness knows it isn't an important work if it doesn't anger da Krishtens.<br /><br />Which is funny, because once again, if they had actually read the entire thing, they might have realized that it's ultimate view of Christianity is not as demeaning.  Funny how often that happens.<br /><br />But of course, I can understand them their not wanting to read further, as the book pretty much presents a plethora of fast-paced ideas without really working on some of the more, shall we say, \\"literate\\"? aspects of the novel.  When people say that this was written to be a movie, they are not lying.  I could see the shots all planned out, but none of the character development we expect from the ability to crawl into these characters' consciencenesses.  \\"He got shot, and felt pain.\\"  That's basically as far as it goes with character development.<br /><br />Indeed, the whole power of the book rests on two things: interesting ideas, and thrills.  The interesting ideas are about as controversial as the book itself: are they real, fabricated, or just misrepresented?  The answer to that pretty much depends on how interested you are in the subject matter and what you know.  Let me put it this way: if you don't know anything about art history and want an entertaining fiction, it's a great novel.  If you're some crazy intelligent person who actually knows about all the information on the book, you'll be too busy nitpicking to enjoy it's, let's call it FICTIONAL, elements.  Because despite the little thing in the front that claims truth, this is a fiction, buddy, and should be taken as such.<br /><br />No, where I actually pull my problems with the novel comes from the things people call it's greatest strength: it's suspense.  Sure, it moves at a breakneck speed, but it moves at a breakneck speed so willing to give denouement to each chapter that you can leave the car at any moment relatively unharmed.  The puzzles, riddles, and such run the gamut between ingenious and obvious (sometimes I was all like \\"Dude, this CAN'T mean anything... oh...\\" and sometimes I was like, \\"Why is it taking half a second for them to figure this one out?\\"), but all of them are given their solution within fifteen pages.  Gripping suspense that is not.  Anyone can rest easy knowing the next big moment of the book is just another five minute's read away, usually with enough expository dialog, (\\"I'm glad you asked, now let me tell you!\\") to know when it's okay to take a break.  The in-book timeline may be short (over the course of less than 24 hours), by the book's thickness is not created by a full twenty four hours of direct action.<br /><br />I think the book could have used some minor dieting.  Lose a couple unnecessary characters, not be so repetitive with the flashbacks (or here's a thought, take them out completely...), do a bit o' the ol' \\"Show, don't tell...\\"  In fact, it went through such lengths to tie up every loose thread that basically nothing was left to the imagination.  That's disappointing, as the book itself is a great medium from which to express these ideas to do something called \\"making people think.\\"  Instead it just kind of finishes everything and then even goes as far as to take the time to explain that it is, in itself, metaphorical and symbolic as well!  Good job there, Mr. Brown.<br /><br />At this point, it's pretty much up to you how much you enjoy it.  What you're expecting is exactly what you'll get out of it.  If you've seen the movie, the book is unnecessary, because you've seen everything and it was written to be a movie.  If you've read the book, the movie is unnecessary, because you've basically read everything and even have the implied shot list.<br /><br />In the end it's basically just another decent pulp novel.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBlog, (\\"I'm glad you asked, now let me tell you!\\") to know when it's okay to take a break.

B000EBEHR2|5.0|Wow. This really took me by surprise. After hearing it was supposedly much more \\"stripped down\\" compared to Sleeping With Ghosts, I feared the worst. Granted, Sleeping With Ghosts was my introduction to Placebo, and is much more appealing to me than their earlier work (which I do like, just not as much). I expected Meds to be much more organic and grungy, without the beautiful electronic textures that made Sleeping With Ghosts so warm and interesting. I was completely misled! Meds is far and away the best Placebo yet. There are still plenty of electronic touches and smooth, catchy melodies. And at the same time, it manages to rock your socks off. <br /> <br />The one thing I don't understand is their decision to make \\"Because I Want You\\" a single. It seems extremely out of place among the other tracks and is quite bland in comparison. It is by far the worst song on the album, and one of only two that I don't love (the other being the Michael Stipe duet, \\"Broken Promise\\"). <br /> <br />There are so many other good tracks, though, it's unbelievable. My absolute favorites are the menacing \\"Infra-Red,\\" the semi-experimental \\"Space Monkey,\\" and the gorgeous ballad \\"Pierrot The Clown.\\" Not far behind are \\"Drag,\\" \\"Post Blue,\\" and \\"Song To Say Goodbye.\\" <br /> <br />I can't believe how many people think Meds and Sleeping With Ghosts are Placebo's worst. I couldn't disagree more with these people! Brian Molko and the boys have created a masterpiece. I typically listen to bands that lean slightly more toward the electro-pop or new wave end of the pop spectrum, and some of my favorite bands have released brilliant new albums this year... which is why I'm so shocked to find that I keep returning to Meds. Somehow it's managed to push its way to #1 on my list of 2006 releases. I love it.
0895260131|3.0|about halfway through you'll start skipping pages looking for a new idea or new argument. There isn't one. Yes, Islam bad. Got that. What's next? the downfall here is there isn't anything next. No \\"and here is what to do about it\\". <br /> <br />Leave this on the coffee table to annoy your perpetually offended visitors - if you have any.
B000AL730O|5.0|Before I heard this album, I figured it could never live up to McCartney's triumphs of the Sixties and Seventies. But there is little doubt: this album would fit right in among his best work. The best tracks are Fine Line, English Tea, Jenny Wren, Too Much Rain and Riding to Vanity Fair. Choas and Creation proves Paul can still make a great album.
076790592X|4.0|I've always heard about this book, but never had the urge to pick it up and read it. I read Albom's other book \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" prior to reading \\"Tuesdays with Morrie.\\" (which I also recommend) I read this book for class and watched the movie. This book really makes the reader think and apply the different topics of discussion in their own personal life. I wondered how I would face death if it was knocking on my door, how would I deal with now distant friends/family who were once close, how would I deal with someone close to me dying? This book takes an in depth look at the things that are important in order to live, all packed into one small book that's easy to read. I think if anyone takes something away after reading it, it should be the ability to start thinking about matters of death, family, values, etc. Because just starting to think about these things opens the doors to look inside yourself and the environment around you.
B000F48CD8|5.0|This album clocks in at just under 34 minutes but when the half hour is this good, it's hard to complain. <br />The versatility that Jack White continues to show year after year is almost mind boggling. From the early White Stripes albums to \\"Candy Cane Children\\" to Loretta Lynn's \\"Van Lear Rose\\" to the music from COLD MOUNTAIN to \\"Get Behind Me Satan\\" to The Raconteurs, you just never know what he's going to do next. You can count on two things though: it will not be a copy of what he's done before and it will be quality music.  <br />I believe he's the best composer and best musician in rock music today (and will be tomorrow).  <br />The Raconteurs debut album is 10 infectious tracks that have a timeless quality. Sometimes it sounds as if this album could have been made in 1973, or 1979, or 1982, or 1990, yet it sounds very contemporary too. Instead of fronting the band, Jack's style is incorporated into a group of incredibly talented performers. The last track \\"Blue Veins\\" is one of the best songs from any of White's projects.  <br />When there's so much insignificant music being made these days, it's good to know you can put your trust in Jack.
B00004Z459|2.0|Still, it's mostly a bunch of yelling and heavy guitars that never manage to come together into a truly compelling song.
0440236304|5.0|A narrative of suspense, action, and horror set inside the mind of Donald Burgett as he struggled to become one of the members of the elite 101st Airborne Division and ultimately survive through World War II. Currahee is written such that one feels as if he is following the main character, Burgett, step by bloody step. This first person narration by the hardened war veteran, Burgett, adds a suspense and gritty realization to the horrors of war. Every chapter focuses around Burgett's adventures and deadly battles he encountered regularly. He describes in detail every action he took, and every shot he fired so that the reader can never miss a beat. He explains his training and how damn near impossible it was to become a paratrooper. The joke going around during his first day of boot camp in 1942 went, \\"If two doctors were on each side of you lookin' in your ears and could see each other, you were a new member of the 101st Airborne!\\" At only 18 years old, Burgett had the heart and mind of sure will and determination. He did whatever he had to do in order to pass the required training and receive his jump wings, qualifying him as one of the best in the army. I am convinced that Burgett and his entire generation who were tough enough to make it into the 101st became the most admirable \\"bunch of guys\\" this nation has ever had for now and generations to come. We, the people, of the United States of America owe them our solemn gratitude and utmost respect that they laid down their lives so that your children, and my children, might be able to live in freedom for years to come. <br /> <br />I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 15. Not only can the language be foul, but the amount of detail in the actual WWII fighting can become too much to endure for young teenagers. The amount of agony, blood, and gore described even left me sick to my stomach and filled with sadness over the amount of death of those brave American soldiers. These citizen soldiers werejust like you and I, working part time at the grocery store and helping their parents clean the table after supper. But when the time came, they all went out to defend their country without hesitation, without remorse for the enemy. That is the beautiful part of this book, that men such as Burgett would answer the call and damn well know that they were risking their lives for the sake of their mothers, fathers, and all of people who lived in this country. That is why every time I read this book I cannot put it down because I know that Burgett was MY AGE when he was in the fields of Normandy risking his life to preserve the sacred word, freedom. With such eminent detail, I often find myself ducking my head thinking that those bullets are going to strike me. I often wondered, \\"He was killing Germans while I am still learning Math, how weak and insignificant I must be compared to him.\\" When I read the first page, I could not stop until I reached page one hundred and fifty. So please, pick up a copy of Currahee and become engulfed with a true story about how self-sacrifice and military excellence ultimately won World War II and preserved freedom to this day.  <br />
B000002H6C|5.0|Even though I'm one of the few people who liked the Load albums, there's no denying that Metallica never again reached the high level of complexity and intensity of ...And Justice for All. Thematically, this album has nothing to do with the supernatural topics that are often associated with heavy metal. Instead, Metallica focus on the horrors of this world - war (Blackened, One), corruption (title track) and mental illness (Frayed Ends of Sanity). Hard-edged from beginning to end, if only you could hear Jason Newsted's bass work in the mix.

1400062756|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It makes a great deal of sense and has got me thinking a great deal about my approach. <br /> <br />The extent to which the points apply generally will not be clear to me until I read the cited research. I can only presume that an author of such academic standing must have described the findings of research accurately. <br /> <br />I can't be sure how 'new' these ideas (or the way they are framed and presented) are. I suspect that the fear of failure is a recurring theme in similar works. Despite this possibility, I think the work is a very worthwhile read in it's own right. <br /> <br />I would also love to see how these ideas could be integrated with evolutionary psychology.
0802130208|1.0|Well, count me in the 'I didn't get it, either' camp too. <br /> <br />I'm not exactly sure which parts of the book were intended to be laugh-out-loud humorous (unless the humor was in the burp-n-fart category and the 200 times the word 'weiner' or 'weenie' was mentioned): A grown man pushing a hot dog cart dressed as a pirate? A pants factory where most of the office staff doesn't bother to show up for work? A woman being stripped by a bird? I will admit that these situations were entertaining, but...funny? Maybe I'm jaded by 20-some-odd years of watching sitcoms where situations like that are commonplace. I don't know.  <br /> <br />I didn't love Ignatius or any of the other characters, but I didn't hate them either. Any book that can make you feel any sort of strong emotion is generally a good one. But this one...I just felt that everyone was sad, pathetic and most of the fringe characters were stereotypes (the bungling cop; the unwashed, free loving, folk-song-singing hippy; the flamboyant gay men; the burly lesbians; the lazy African-Americans; the idiot stripper; the demented senior citizens). I just didn't care what happened to any of them. <br /> <br />
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Scary Movie~ Jon Abrahams is one of the best parodies of all time. They have like totally hit the horror genre right on. The movies that they spoof are plentifull, like I know what you did last summer, scream ofcourse, and many others. Ann Faris is right on the mark with her like parody of Cindy in the scream movies. Some of my favortite scenes are the scene when cindy talks with her father, the carmen electra death scene, cindy getting wasted and the garage scene with the fake 40's (gotta love the labels like cult 45, killer and satan) with first like a the classic cat scene and then a horse?. The music is also carbon copy of bad horror movies and the acting is over the top just like in bad horror movies. This is a movie not to be missed. Highly recommended.
B00004YA66|5.0|It's a father and son buddy movie...<br />It's a science fiction movie...<br />It's a serial killer thriller movie...<br />It's a baseball movie...<br /><br />And somehow it all hangs together beautifully, does a good job of portraying the love between a father and son and never gets morose or maudlin.  The writer, director, and actors took a formula that sounds like it is ripe for disaster and make a great movie!  Imagine that.<br /><br />Oh, and anyone who pans this movie in their review is just being a stupid schmuck.  A movie doesn't have to be Fellini, Trufau, Jarmish, Wenders, Kurasawa, or Bergman - yes, I too can be pretentious.
1400079276|4.0|This is my first Murakami book. Prior to reading Kafka on the Shore, i was told that he has written better books. Obviously, I have nothing to measure it against but I must say that if this is not his best book, I'm definitely in for a treat when I read his earlier ones.  <br /> <br />Parallels between the two journeys or stories of Kafka Tamura and Mr. Nakata are underscored on several occasions. Actions in one story always affect the other and such a plot structure invariably compels the reader to draw intersections of the two stories on his or oher own. This, i would say, accounts greatly for the intrigue or addictiveness of the novel as it engages us and forces us to accept such dreamlike-ness as perfectly plausible. Given the title, I guess one can say anything less than such bizarreness would be a great disappointment.  <br /> <br />The fact that many parts are left unexplained towards the end also compound the bizarreness. Either Murakami has ran out of steam here or simply refuses to tie the plot neatly together. Personally, i'm inclined towards the former cos I think a much better crafted plot (even when that stresses on uncertainty) would at least leave one with some suggestions to ponder over.  <br /> <br />Overall though, the book is compelling and entertaining. Characterization, for one, is intriguing, especially because of the hermaphrodite, Oshima. In him/her, i think the novel seeks to epitomize the essence of its plot--the overwhelming uncertainties, and blurring and impossibility of distinctions or dichotomies in the current world; life is but a dream. Also, I wonder if the constant references to past, memories and war are a nod to the impact of Japan's militaristic past. In any case, this is a book i would recommend to friends. Definitely an interesting read.
B000AL730O|4.0|I have allowed myself some time and many playings before writing a review, because I wanted to see how I felt about this record after a bit as opposed to first impression. My feeling today is similar to how I felt when I first heard it - it is very good.  Some other reviewers have called it a mature album and I agree.  Some have said it has a bit of edge (while being restained) and sounding a bit more modern than some of Paul's recent efforts.  And I would agree there too. But all in all, I think it is a record that plays well from start to finish.  The songsa and the performances are excellent.  McCartney is rightfully a legend.  And it is very nice to see his art mature, refine and continue to grow as time marches on.  I would give this 4 and 1/2 stars if allowed, and the only reason I don't give it 5 is because of the fact that the competition in Paul's own catalogue (including that 60's band he played in) is so astronomically great.
B00006JDVV|3.0|3 1\2 STARS<br /><br />It's hard to NOT like this movie...<br /><br />I admit this movie wasn't designed to win any Oscars, it was meant to enjoy. Reign of Fire is a horrific vision of the future where mankind struggles to survive as dragons rage across the planet, destroying all they come across. Only a few humans have managed to live, by going underground and living a hand to mouth existence. I won't give away much more because I don't want to blow the movie with any spoilers. Mathew McConaughey transformed himself in this movie, looking different than ever before, playing against his normal type, and it works to perfection. Christian Bale is also strong in this movie. As the leader of the British survivors, he shines in his quiet heroism. The special effects aren't anything earthshaking, but they're good. My only question with the special effects was why do the dragons have holes in their wings? The story line leaves a few plot gaps, but like I said, it wasn't meant to be art, it was meant to be what it is: an action charged, explosive packed, fun filled, blood and fire packed movie, that's great for the action movies buff in all of us. Highly recommended!
0060555661|5.0|This is a must for anyone that wants to be serious about investments, and hopes to become an Enterprising Investor and to beat the market. The father of Value Investment and the mentor of Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham teaches you how to think like an investor. For the more defensive passive investor that doesn't intend to put serious effort into their investment education there are better books as even with the revised additions this isn't about defensive passive index investing that most investors should embark  upon that aren't ready for a 2nd full time job.
B00005JO20|5.0|I loved it a bit long but it was worth it i really didn't want to see it because i thought it would be just another movie that would be boring and might put me to sleep in the first couple of miuntes watching it  but it makes you say aaaahhhh i want a big furry king kong too lol but don't think i can keep in in new york as a pet...<br /><br />Turly an amazing film 10 thumbs up to Peter Jackson

B00003CXE7|4.0|Amazing! Wonderful!<br /><br />I havn't seen the extended version, but the original is one of the best movies ever(It's in my personal top two and gaining)! It is an epic that deserves to go down in history beside Beowulf, The Song of Rolland, etc. Russle Crow is at his best with a performace that makes even the toughest movie goer misty-eyed. The plot is beautiful and uplifting, with a hero you root for and a villan that is one of the best(aka most evil) ever to grace the silver screen. The characters are consistant, never lapsing into goofy moments. I could say more about it but this review would get too long.
0765315246|5.0|I have been a sci-fi fan since I was 4 years old, & my father took me to see Star Wars: A New Hope.  I was hooked.  I've seen EVERY sci-fi movie to come out since, & several that came out before.  I have always understood the love of the Star Trek series, but never understood the cult following of it.  It is completely unrealistic.  A society of humans that are NOT motivated by power, greed & the need to dominate others???   Not likely!   I always found it hard to believe that any large group of humans could ever reach the level of peace & harmony that would be required for anything like the Federation of Planets to exist.  I loved the stories, but found it was simply a fairy tale.  Now this is something totally different.  Scalzi's universe is the one that needs a cult following.  Imagine if NASA joined with the other science & space organizations from every country on Earth & decided to move to their space stations, & forsake the rest of us.  Free from the constraints of religious based fear of scientific advancement, how long do you think it would take them to leave us technologically in the dust?  They'd be so far ahead of us in 1 generation's time we would never recover.  They'd be free of all diseases & working towards colonizing new planets, while we would still be here trying to figure out athlete's foot.  That's the Colonial Union.  Scalzi has given us an image of the future that could very well BE our future. The story is quick-paced, but not scattered.  It moves along well, but still allows for enough character development so you care about John Perry & his group of \\"Old Farts\\"!  The idea of getting to be 75 & then given a chance to become young again doesnt hurt either! LOL!  This is a must read for anyone who loves the science-fiction genre!

1580084621|5.0|I have been interested in Thai cooking for a while. I have some extra time on my hands lately, so this is a good time for me to try my hand. This is a good book, I have not tried all the dishes yet, but I did get about a third through the book. Everything is easy to follow, and so far the things I made came out really well. Some of the ingrediants  can be a bit hard to find (water chestnuts, lemon grass) depending where you live, This is a good book for anyone interested Thai cuisine.
B000BCE918|5.0|3 movies how can you go wrong, fun, humor, action etc...<br /><br />This is a great film that not only goes into the ethics of scientific progress, but also analyzes how the human spirit prevails in difficult situations so that most of the people in the park survive. This is a must-see for anyone who likes the sci-fi genre.

B000002MFE|4.0|The reviewer who noted that Clapton's songs are made fresher by being unplugged is right on! For me Clapton is one of founding fathers of electric guitar. His work in Cream is the subconscious. Here he is kinder and gentler, more subtle and, like a good wine, better than ever. I especially think this applies to the Johnson material (Malted Milk, Walkin' Blues). Let me note that the GODFATHER OF ALL UNPLUGGED events, ground zero for the whole phenomenon is also a guitar album, the best live one EVER recorded: FRIDAY NIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO (Di Meola, McLaughlin, De Lucia). Buy it now.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I read the book before the movie came out and my reaction was \\"They're making a movie on this?\\" It's just not that great of a story. Granted, the movie is better than the book. There are more characters. But still, it's just not that great. There's a lot of beautiful scenery in this movie though and good acting. Although I found Heath Ledger to be very difficult to understand half the time. I'd say this movie was good but not great.
B00097DXZS|3.0|Let me first say that I love Carlos: no one has more generosity and heart. He continues to play beautiful music that is always renewed by collaborative efforts. I am impressed by a few tracks here especially \\"Trinity\\". If you like the \\"interactive\\" and \\"collaborative\\" Carlos let me STRONGLY recommend a CD called \\"Love, Devotion, Surrender\\": an extended jam with John McLaughlin, arguably the heaviest guitarist on the planet. For thirty years now McLaughlin has been a mentor, teacher, and best friend to Carlos.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Just when I was about to give up on popular music as a whole, along comes Gnarls Barkley to restore the faith. \\"Crazy\\", the first single off the album made the record books here in the UK by being the first single to make it to number one without the single actually being available in the shops. It got to the top of the charts by download sales alone. The album also promptly shot to number one on the album charts upon its release and one listen will tell you why. I just can't stop playing it!<br /><br />The producer known as Danger Mouse and the singer known as Cee-Lo have put together a magical concoction of soul, rhythm and blues, gospel, hip hop and whatever else takes their fancy, and the end product is just damn good music, pure and simple. This is not for the fainthearted nor the listener with narrow-minded stereotypical expectations of what music should be. This is daring adventurous stuff and thank goodness for that. Someone once told me that Cee-Lo is of the same mindset (musically and artistically) as Andre Benjamin from OutKast. I didn't see it then but I see it now. If you're into the uniqueness of OutKast, you'll love this.<br /><br />It's impossible for me to choose favourite songs here, which I'm still trying to wrap my brain round (What? A 2006 album where I like ALL the songs?!) but \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Smiley Faces\\" are both instant classics. And please, check out these lyrics on the song \\"Who Cares?\\": \\"You see everybody is somebody, But nobody wants to be themselves; And if I ever wanted to understand me, I have to talk to someone else...\\"<br /><br />Now THAT is how a lyric should be written. The kind of stuff that makes you stop and think.<br /><br />Observers are already asking whether Gnarls Barkley could possibly be the saviour of an ailing music industry? If their success encourages more music makers to have the courage of their convictions, step outside of the box and dare to be different and original, I very much believe they could. My only complaint? I agree with most of the other reviewers of this album - it's all over way too soon!her reviewers of this album - it's all over way too soon!

0156030306|5.0|This book by Daniel Keyes is expertly written and offers an in-depth look into one man's life. Charlie Gordon, a retarded thirty-two year old man, has always lived a simple life. He grew up with a somewhat neglectful mother who could never accept the fact that he was retarded. The one thing Charlie always longed for was being accepted into the world as a person. He may have been retarded, but he had feelings. <br /> <br />Charlie is approached by a science research team and to make a long story short, is made into a genius, along with an experimental mouse named Algernon. Gradually his mental and emotional self matures and he learns things about himself that he never would have known. Suddenly Algernon begins to become hostile and erratic in his behavior and Charlie fears for his own sake.  <br /> <br />Daniel Keyes provides unique atmosphere of suspense that keeps the reader into the book throughout its entirety. I found myself many nights reading one hundred pages at a time because the book was so expertly written. As Charlie as the narrator, the book covers the changes that Charlie experiences as he grows intellectually. It is fascinating!!
1400079179|3.0|This is a typical Dan Brown novel. That said, it was a good book, fun to read, even thought-provoking. The 1 star ratings on here for the book are clearly written by people offended by the material.<br /><br />If it didn't center around Catholicism it would be rather forgettable. What it will do is make you re-think some of the things you were probably taught to believe as a child, including whether Jesus was truly divine or just a charismatic man whose followers managed to start a very successful religion.<br /><br />I tend to believe Jesus was just flesh and blood, nothing magical about him. The book's message seems to push that idea. It also casts a light on the dark past of the Catholic Church and its calculated attempts to keep its power. Dan Brown does a good job of showing just how ruthless the Church has been to maintain its grip over its followers.<br /><br />If you're afraid of new ideas that might make you question your faith or you're not strong enough to withstand pointed criticism in a fictional format, you're better off not reading this novel.  However, if some history, conspiracy, and fast action are what you like you could do much worse than The Da Vinci Code.
B000002513|5.0|okay, okay. fluffy the human being has made a few reviews on amazon & they've been pure negative (if i remember right?). all poison. pure sour grapes. fluffy, however, is not actually a negative person. he actually likes most of the cd's & books he gets: therefor it's time to say something good about something, & this is the first item i choose to go all googly over. I got this in 1976, & i loved it then & i love it now. i wish mr. springsteen would try something this musically ambitious & varied again. on any given day it is possibly my favorite album of his. a great record. get it before you drop dead & it's too late.

It ended like any other episode.

055357342X|3.0|I thought the first book was interesting and well done, if not true 'high fantasy' (see my review). However, I'm finding this series seems to drone on and one in the same fashion. Each book reads exactly like the previous books. The same characters are doing the same things, thinking the same thoughts, etc etc. I actually don't mind when main characters are killed in this book because I'm so thoroughly BORED of them that killing them will at least force Martin to introduce other characters. I actually think \\"Yay! So and so is dead so I won't have to read any further chapters named after them!\\".  <br /> <br />This series is playing out like Dynasty/Dallas/Knot's Landing set in medieval times. Please, throw a wizard, warlock, elf, dragon, magic, etc in, George? Pretty please? If you do, we promise not to throw this series in the 'fiction' section instead of the sci/fi/fantasy section because you know something? It has absolutely no place in that section.
1400079179|3.0|I am sure by now, you've heard of the novel THE DA VINCI CODE.  If you are looking for a flurry of page-turning excitement, this is not it.  I found this book to be immensely overrated.  Still, I can see why some people would like it.  The movie was horrid.  I saw it this weekend and thought the book had to be better.  The book was better, but it was still overly detailed and the character was flat and uninspiring.  To give this book a letter grade, it would  be a C+.  Thank you for reading my review, LISA SCHUMER
B00001OH7G|5.0|Started listening to this back in '74 when I was a wee lad .It still sounds amazing all these years later.Walk on Hot coals is a masterpiece of Strat sounds.I put it alongside Jimi's \\"Machine Gun\\" from the original Band of Gypsies recording and Trowers \\"Daydream\\" from his 1975 \\"Live \\" recording.A must have .
0684824906|2.0|The book suffers from two flaws that in my opinion are ultimately fatal.<br /><br />1.) The writing suffers from the over-use of indefinite pronouns. Before the end of the second chapter, you will be annoyed by the number of sentences which are impenetrable because there are three or four actors ... all of whom are referred to in the sentence as \\"he\\".  Which he did what is left as an exercise to the reader.<br /><br />2.) Equally unfortunately, some of the most important developments in Lincoln's thinking are presented as fact but inadequately defended or not defended at all.  It becomes unclear whether Lincoln's ultimate motivation was, for instance, to free slaves or to create a place for himself in history.<br /><br />The first failure is merely annoying; the second effort dooms the book.  By the end of the book, I was convinced that the only difference between Lincoln and Bush II was that Lincoln had picked a cause that he could actually win.<br /><br />This book was for me ultimately depressing, and more so because I had to work so hard to understand it.  Here's an easy example I picked simply by opening the book and reading until I found one.  I opened to late on page 567, and in the first full paragraph of page 568, the last two sentences are as follows (actors in the first part of the paragraph are Bates, Gamble, and Chase.)<br /><br />\\"Gamble replied that Bates should hardly be shocked by Chase's willingness to entertain \\"these persons,\\" for \\"Mr. Chase is the author of our troubles here.\\"  His \\"criminal ambition\\" for the presidency had led him to incite the struggle, and he would undoubtedly have the support of every radical paper in the state if he were to decide to run against Lincoln\\"<br /><br />To understand the book you have to determine who the \\"he\\" is here (if, as appears to be the case in this instance, \\"he\\" only refers to one person, which is rarely the case in the book) and whether or not the statement \\"undoubtedly have the support of every radical paper in the state\\" is:<br /><br />1.) the opinion of Gamble<br />2.) supported by other facts<br />3.) referring to a specific state, and if so what state<br /><br />The author wasn't quoting Gamble, so why not just insert the name of the state?  Gah!  And this was an easy example.<br /><br />Perhaps I am overburdening the author with a need to write clearly.  But unclear writing often follows from unclear thinking.  Therefore the writing undermines the credibility of the book ... especially since the writing is supposed to be showing the state of Lincoln's mind, and Lincoln had an unusual ability to show his thinking in clear, concise speeches.f Gamble  2.) supported by other facts   3.) referring to a specific state, and if so what state    The author wasn't quoting Gamble, so why not just insert the name of the state?

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|From the breathtaking English countryside to the finely-honed performances, this movie is a real delight.  All of Jane Austen's characters are there:  the long-suffering Mr. Bennett, the manic, matchmaking Mrs. Bennett, the lovely Jane, the feisty Elizabeth, the dour Mr. Darcy, the affable Mr. Bingley, and the imperious Lady Catherine.  Many of the lines are taken directly from the book, and the important plots and subplots are all there.  The sharp divisions between social classes are evident, as is the scheming behind who is to marry which man and receive which yearly income.  The casting is superb, from Donald Sutherland as the befuddled and very much outnumbered male in the Bennett household to Judi Dench, in the small but pivotal role of Lady Catherine.  \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of my favorite books and this movie truly does it justice.
0316172324|3.0|There are a few good ideas in here, which attracted me (as well as millions of others) to pick up this book.  I am impressed at the sheer number of people he's convinced to buy his book at first blink.  However, Mr Gladwell ultimately falls victim to his own preachings as he seems to shun the alternative logical, methodical way of doing things, resulting in a work with a few interesting but embryonic ideas and no clear flow of themes. <br /> <br />What really rankled with me was the writing.  It's appalling.  From Chapter One: \\"He's gotten so good at thin-slicing marriages that he says he can be in a restaurant and eavesdrop on the couple one table over and get a pretty good sense of whether they need to start thinking about hiring lawyers and dividing up custody of the children.\\"  This is undoubtedly the most tortuous sentence I've read in print.  Come on Mr Gladwell, haven't you heard that \\"it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing\\"? <br /> <br />Perhaps he should have taken a cue from \\"Freakonomics\\" author Steven Levitt and gotten a journalist to do the writing for him.  In addition, the editing is just sloppy.  The frequent typos quite spoiled for me this otherwise fairly entertaining light read.  It's an informal collation of behavioural experiments and amusing incidents illustrating triumphs of instinct, but don't expect to walk away with a clearer understanding of how and when to use this intuition any better.  I'm just glad I borrowed it because I wouldn't have paid to read this.
B00005MP58|5.0|Girl meets both good guy and bad guy.  <br />Bad guy turns worse.  <br />Showdown.  <br />Good guy gets girl.  <br /> <br />This, in short, is the story but of course I'm joking - Jane Austen's laconic wit and the delightful lightness of her writing are justly famed and have lost nothing of their charm and entertaining quality in two hundred years. As with all of her books, they are very well worth reading because of her wonderful ironic comments that usually fall by the wayside in dramatisations, even the best ones. I feel that this TV production, too, would have benefitted from an occasional background narrator giving us at least the funniest of Austen's remarks and observations about her characters. But all in all, that is a minor point: This \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a gem, every single actor is fantastic, Jennifer Ehle does justice to Elizabeth's vivacity and wit, on top of being truly beautiful and having a lovely and mischievous smile (funny that the very same actress all but ruined \\"Possession\\" for me but that is a different story). Colin Firth is simply perfect as the brooding dark horse who turns out to be such a diamond in the rough (if you permit the cheap metaphor). He is, in short, the thinking woman's heartthrob and that alone should be reason enough to watch this DVD. Afterwards, you'll want to read the book, too. I could think of no better combination, other than maybe Darcy and Elizabeth themselves.
1559409002|5.0|this is the best i have ever seen this movie!!!!  this low-buget horror classic has been made to look new and for a film made 40 years ago the extras are great. this was a gift,so the price wasn't a problem for me,but if you don't love this movie you may not want to pay the price,but if you want to see this classic in a new light give it a try you will find much to love here!
B000EULJLU|2.0|I waited a long time for Tool to release something new and I was quite dissapointed with this album.  There are no songs on it that I found even mildly entertaining.  I'm glad I didn't spend too much money on it.  It wasn't even worth a second listen to.  Despite being downright boring as far as the lyrics and the guitar riffs it  seemed like every song on this album was a rehash of the first song on the album.  Pass on this unless you just want to support the band.
B000683VI4|4.0|I want to start off by saying that even as a guy, I loved this movie.  So yes, it is the ultimate sappy, tear-jerking, chick flick, but it's a really good one!    The movie is a mixture of all the right elements : the scenery is utterly breathtaking, the story is beautiful and it's a great adaptation that remains faithful to the book, the casting and acting are near perfection (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams work great on-screen, and McAdams is amazing!).  And I also loved the \\"feel\\" of the movie image-wise, at times I felt like I was watching a movie from 25 years ago because of the play with colors, etc...which gave it an original feel to it.    The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because as beautiful a love story as it is, it wasn't as emotionally charged as I thought it would have been.  The kiss under the rain, for example, lacked the feel of longing and passion mixed together, if that makes any sense.  But then again, that's just me.    On this level, I enjoyed \\"A Walk To Remember\\" (also an adaptation from a Nicholas Sparks book) much more, I could relate to the characters a little more, which gave it that extra something.  There's also the fact that Alzheimer's disease isn't depicted realistically, even if it is put that way to show the power love has.    Other than that, there's nothing remotely negative I could say. It's a beautiful, moving story about the power of love, that I'd definitely recommend (as well as the movie \\"A Walk To Remember\\").
0061008079|5.0|I bought this book many years ago...The first time I read this book,I was hooked, not only on Emma Harte but also Barbara Taylor Bradford. When ever I get to a point in my life that I feel I need a boost, I re-read this novel! It makes me feel like I can do anything, just like Emma!
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Let me just say that I am female and appreciate a variety of genres, such as jazz, R&B, pop, rock, etc. I have never, for some reason, listened to hardly any Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, White Stripes or any metal.  <br /> <br />However, I really enjoy this album. Quite simply, and to be really cliched, it rocks. Faves include White Unicorn, Pyramid, Mind's Eye, Joker & the Thief, Dimension. This CD has been on high rotation on my stereo and ipod since I got it.  <br /> <br />I wanted to put in my 5 cents' worth given that I am not normally into 'this type' of music. I just find it very musical, catchy and original (despite the comparisons). (Oh, and maybe I am a little patriotic as I am here in Australia :). Enjoy. <br />

B000EQ5SRK|4.0|I absolutely love this movie. When I was in high school, a bunch of us went to see it (yeah, I'm dating myself aren't I?) and I loved it then. Good to know that 13 years later I still love Sliver. Perhaps it was my giant crush on William Baldwin that really made this movie sparkle to me. Or perhaps it was the voyeuristic ambiance throughout it. Either way, this is a fun little thriller that will keep you entertained. For the guys, you can oggle Sharon Stone in all her hotness. And as I mentioned, for the ladies, there's William Baldwin to adore. Basically, a woman named Carly (Stone) moves into the Sliver tower where there have been several weird deaths, most recently, a woman whose looks resemble Carly's, who happened to be the former tenant of the apartment Carly just bought. A variety of suitors attempt to get Carly's attention, one of which brings her a telescope, in turn making her realize that she indeed likes to watch. But who's watching Carly? Ah, to go into it any further would ruin this fine little movie. I'm not saying it's the best ever, but Sliver is plenty of fun for men & women alike who enjoy thrillers.
B000E0WJIC|4.0|These guys clearly know what they're doing. They have quite a bit of potential. This album is really good, but I agree with the fact that there is a lot of competition in this genre. They do play very well though, and the guitar solo's do set them apart a little. I totally disagree with the 14 year old girl comment, this album hits hard, the only thing a 14 year old girl might enjoy about this album would be the band's name (which I find kind of unoriginal, but its only a name). The vocals can get a little anoying but for the most part they don't hold the album down and are decent most of the time. If you're into metal and hard rock, this album has a little bit for everyone. A great effort overall.
B000F1IQMS|5.0|Steven Spielburgh's \\"Munich\\" is a fearless classic.  He takes the 1972 Olympic slayings of innocent Israeli athletes and recreates the ordeal in all its horrifying detail.  We get some of the footage from ABC's \\"Wide World of Sports\\" to create authenticity, but the reinactment has all the immediacy and horror of \\"Schindler's List\\" and more.  After the outrage, one of Golda Meier's trusted bodyguards (Eric Bana) is summoned to join a team of assassins meant to seek vengeance on the perpetrators.  The vast majority of the movie focuses on the complexity, the obsession, and the miscalculations that come from this type of counter-terrorism.  The missteps are harrowing.  The most touching scene is when they are set to bomb an assassin at his residence, but they immediately need to stop it when his adorable little daughter unexpectedly reappears.      There has been much commentary made about the agenda of this movie.  Despite any stance, Spielburgh has made a relevant movie, a true movie, at a crucial time.  The movie questions the premise of festering violence and its consequences.  It does so through the dialogue without preaching, but mainly through the action which is often horrifying and brimming with suspense.  There are two matching scenes, one at the beginning and one at the end, where the maverick protagonist has an intimate scene with his wife.  It doesn't really give away too much of the movie, but it frames the theme of the film.  He has become a hero to his people for requiting the crimes of the extremists, but it illustrates that he has done so at a high personal price.
B00005K3NR|5.0|the fact that sissy spacek and piper laurie both got oscar nods for a horror movie(horror movies aren't oscar bound very much) tells you something about this movie,de palma's best (best horror movie anyway). his \\"style\\"(long tracking shots,split screens,slow motion action,and over the top gore)is very much out there for all to see,but the acting of spacek(as a mouse of a girl ,beat down in every way possible by her crazy religous mother(piper laurie in her best supporting acttress role,the last word in \\"controling mother\\"). their scenes together put this tale of esp and getting even with those who wrong you,into a level never reached by most movies(horror movies anyway). the prom is one of the classic of the gore hound school of horror and i dare you not to jump at the ending of this shocker.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I know of no other band ever that was on the roll that RHCP is. Starting with BSSM, then Californication, then BTW and now Stadium Arcadium. They have been at the top of their game for ten years now and do not seem to be slipping at all. Certainly Rick Rubin factors heavy into this fact. Let's face it, the band started to change with BSSM and then totally changed with Californication. The Hendrix-style, white-funk is pretty much gone, or at least modified. I know that some of their hardcore fans don't appreciate that. Sure, a lot of these new songs are softer ballads, but still, they are brilliant songs. Frusciante has never played better guitar then he has in the last two albums. On Stadium Arcadium he is at his best, all but dominating the musicianship on the album. Flea is still a bass god, but Frusicante has ascended to new heights. Keedis is the icon of the music industry right now, his voice and energy have never been matched. He can sing up tempo numbers to get your feet tapping and then turn around and sing the most beautiful ballad you have ever heard. Of the two discs on this recording, I think Jupiter is the superior. With tracks like Dani California, Snow and Wet Sand, it could stand alone as one of the best RHCP albums ever released. Mars has some great songs as well, with Make You Feel Better being the best. Yes, the Peppers have changed a lot, hell, call them RHCP Part II, but in my opinion, they have evolved into something better and people better appreciate them now, before they are gone.
076790592X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Tuesdays with Morrie, is an indepth look at the meaning of life, and how Morrie viewed it as a dying man.  As he watched his own body wither away, he was able to give great insight, and love with many around him, including his old student Mitch.  Morrie is an extrovert, and displays what the true meaning of life is to Mitch, \\"To love others or die\\".  This book has so much to say in less than 200 pages, and is definately worth reading.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|Let's face it, these guys have 2 catchy songs...and the rest is just pretty much fluff. This music is best suited for some smokey coffee house in upstate NY. Although, after hearing them play live on Late Night With Connan Obrien, I'm beginning to wonder how they ever created a following at all! Their live performance on Connan was one of the worst I've heard in ages. It's a shame I stayed up late waiting to hear them. <br /> <br />Overall though, the album is pretty good. It's easy to listen to. Perfect for driving through rolling meadows on warm summer days.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|If Black Sabbath and Deep Purple had a kid... <br /> <br />Actually, one band I haven't seen sighted as a comparison for this Australian trio is Uriah Heep, whom I think surface in quite a few tracks here. <br /> <br />Anyhoo, this is goooooooood stuff.  I have a pinched nerve from headbanging to \\"Colossal\\", \\"Dimension\\", and \\"Woman\\", the last one being one of the most exhausting songs ever to pour out of my three-foot-tall tweed-covered speakers.   <br /> <br />That's right, folks, break out the black lights and lava lamps, because we've got yet another young-band-sounding-like-old-bands act.  Only difference is not only did these guys get it right that I dare say they improved upon it.  If I didn't know any better I'd say \\"Colossal\\" was supposed to have been on Sabbath's Master of Reality album, but some strange time paradox landed it here (that's meant as a compliment). <br /> <br />Thick, sludgy organ paints with dark carnival colors while rich, heavy-fuzztoned guitars hurl you forward into an firing squad of old-school beat-the-s#!t-out-of-em drums.  And the whole thing is serenaded by a Robert Plant meets Ozzy Osbourne voice.  A vocalist hasn't been this suited to his band since Bon Scott with AC\DC. <br /> <br />A couple of over-the-top-weird songs aside, this is great fun.  Catchy, heavy and addictive.
0553582461|5.0|I read Assassin's Apprentice almost 2 years ago.  I liked Hobb's writing but the story really didn't captivate me at all.  The pacing was very slow and the plot never seemed to go anywhere until the very end.  The next 2 in the trilogy sat on my shelf for a long while, and finally, some months back, I decided I would give her series another try and I picked up Royal Assassin.  This time, I was hooked right away.  The characters enthralled me, and her unpredictable plot and story twists kept me on the edge of my seat.  I didn't hesitate to pick up the Liveship series and finished those wonderful books very quickly, and then went right into the Tawny Man.  Her trilogies just keep getting better and better. <br />Fool's Fate stars a little slow, but once Fitz and many of the other characters depart and the story gets going, it doesn't stop.  Hobb has a way of keeping you excited and enthralled without having to use a lot of action, and rewards the reader when the action sequences do come about, though there's so much emotional attachment to the characters, her action sequences are almost difficult to read for not knowing the outcome.   <br />One of Hobb's greatest strenghts is writing the relationships between her characters, especially between Fitz and everyone else.  Her books seem to be a character drama that happens to have a fantasy backdrop.  Normally this would not appeal to me, but she does it so darn well.  I find myself anticipating charcter relations and reunions more than I anticipate plot developments. <br />Eventually all good things come to an end, even this book at a hefty 900+ pages.  I won't reveal much for those who haven't read it, but I have to say that I was scared at how Hobb might end the series.  As long time fans will surely know, Fitz hasn't always gotten the long end of the stick.  But the ending was great, it was a perfect balance of bitter and sweet and I don't know of a better way that it could have ended.  I even cried... that's right, Icried at the end.  I didn't realize until it was over how attached I was to these characters and was very sad to see them go.   <br />For me, Hobb has moved herself into the Fantasy Hall of Fame with George R.R. Martin and Guy Gavriel Kay.  I will keep her books on my shelves always and look forward to reading them all again in the future.   <br />Long live Fitz and the Fool as legends of our time...
0316172324|5.0|I finished this book over a month ago and to this day think about it every day. That is the power of this book. <br />I strongly recommend it to every working man or woman.
0875428940|5.0|There are some reviewers who mention the deck's happy go luck outlook and watered down imagery.  That may be the case with a more seasoned reader- I don't know, but as a beginner I couldn't disagree less. <br /> <br />The images are simple and clear enough to evoke an immediate emotional response from even those not interested in tarot.  Reversals are easy to read and interpret.  Take the wheel of fortune card for instance.  Right side up it shows a woman expriencing great luck and joy in a wheel and it's reversal shows a woman in black in great despair on that same wheel.  The depiction of sorrow is dark and clear enough to strike a cord in a beginner's heart.  I have to say, I have looked upon this card and some others with dread.  So much for happy go lucky. lol. <br /> <br />I have a more traditional deck as well and it doesn't evoke the same reaction from me.  I don't 'fear' the negative cards of the more advanced deck nor do I quietly celebrate the positive ones in readings.  I realize this is because the imagery of more traditional decks is not powerful or distinct enough to really mean much to the beginner.  The problem doesn't exist with this deck.
B000002KY8|5.0|I bought this CD in a nostalgia-induced music buying bender and have had it in heavy rotation ever since. Unlike Def Leppard's often cringeworthy 'Pyromania,' (my sincere apologies, guys)1999 has stood the test of time--and then some. If you haven't listened to this album in a long while or if you (gasp) have never heard it, you owe it to yourself to give the early genius that is Prince a listen. <br /> <br />While I used to choreograph dance routines to 'Little Red Corvette' in my basement when I was in sixth grade, now I vacuum my livingroom with it cranked. (Sad but true.) At least I have Prince to ease the pain of aging.
0764113496|2.0|These kinds of books are a joke in my opinion. I suppose that some incredibly lazy Russian language student could find the answer to some obvious question that they should be figuring out on their own. Anyone that is lazy and is learning Russian is learning the wrong language; better stick with pig latin.    Russian verbs is a very complex subject and you can buy many books in Russia that are just devoted to verbs or motion or perfective/imperfective and they are all clear as mud usually.    There are good spelling dictionaries you can buy from Russia that have every verb know there in case there are some participles or gerunds that you are unsure of but the rest you can find out in a regular dictionary and derive using rules you learn in the first few weeks of studying Russian.    My general advice is that unless you are very sure what you are buying, DO NOT buy any books on Russian written by non native speakers. In general non native speakers can't hit the broad side of barn with their understanding of Russian.    Get \\"5000 Russian Words With All Their Inflected Forms: A Russian-English Dictionary by Richard L. Leed and Slava Paperno  \\". This is an infinitely better book. There is really no comparison.    I bought the 501 Russian verbs book and I never use it.     Whereas the one I mentioned is very useful and well organized.    In general, I would not buy any books on Russian that are by non native speakers. There are a very few exceptions but this is not one of them.    I actually question the usefullness of this whole series of books. You need to learn verbs in context of actual Russian movies or books or real speech you hear. If you try and use them by learning them in a dictionary, the result will be laughable.    For example, when you hear an imperative a lot or see it a lot, you will learn it and then know it and how and when it is used. Do you really expect to look up an imperative in a dictionary and use it correctly? That is such a laughable notion. Especially in Russian!
B000001FA4|5.0|What we have in 'The Unforgettable Fire' is absolute classic U2 that shows what makes them a top class rock band and pre-dates the more preachy nature that the band have introduced in more recent years. <br /> <br />The album opens with 'A Sort of Homecoming', the kind of genuine U2 rock song that they have, to an extent, lost along the way. Indeed much of what is on show here has been lost along the way by U2. It is not that their new music is bad, but somewhat more predictable. It is difficult to picture them doing a completely instrumental number like '4th of July' on a newer album. 'Bad' is another form of their music that has all but disappeared and is a classic that is typical of their earlier albums. <br /> <br />This is the album that truly launched U2 in America and it is easy to see why. This is the first U2 album that clearly defines their sound and defines the sound that they would follow for years to come. Here there is a very marked departure from the days of 'Boy' and 'October'. 'The Unforgettable Fire' marks the beginning of U2's musical expression of their connection to American rock and also marks the starting point of what was to become their world renowned style.
B0002X314C|4.0|For the most part this is a near flawless CD.  It starts off establishing the fact that man is imperfect and then flips the subject to prove that man can change for the better.  The first half of the album sports tracks like 'Used to Love You' 'Alright' and 'She Don't Have to Know' covering the bases of broken relationships, talking about trying too hard to make a relationship work when it won't to going as far as cheating on the ones we love...and then theres a changing point for once John and Snoop take on the track 'I Can Change' the album takes a different approach, scrapping the bad ways and pleading for forgivness, stating his undying love and devotion and praising those who've been there for him the whole time.  Tracks like 'Stay With You' and 'Refuge' are just so heartfelt and beautiful that you become a believer, no matter how much John established his pimp mentality on the dreadful 'Number One'.  There are quite a few golden tracks here, the two singles (perfectly chosen) 'Used to Love You' & 'Ordinary People' included, but tracks like 'Alright' and 'Stay With Me' lay on the bass and beats heavy while 'So High' and even the opener 'Let's Get Lifted' slow things down and give us raw emotion and pure talent.  The song subjects in general may not be completly origional but with the family throwback in 'I Don't Have to Change' and the creamy vocals on 'So High' John serves up just enough difference from track to track to keep us interested...and in this day and age there isn't much that hasn't been sung before, so it comes down to HOW you sing it, and in John's case he sings it just right!
B000FDFVZ6|3.0|This book was excellent up until the last 4 chapters or so. I loved that Sebold told the story from the point of view of the murder victom and followed all of her family members and friends as they dealed with her death over the years. The plot continued to build and build only to fall flat, creating a lowsy ending. I almost wonder if the author had no idea how she wanted the story to end and hurridly threw one together. I still think it was a good read but the ending does not do justice to the rest of the book.
B000C65Z1G|3.0|The problem with this movie is that at its core it is a standard plot cliche.  There's little more here than the old Hollywood standby \\"evil profit mongering corporation driven by a corrupt CEO and/or politician\\".  Typically, this leaves only the context and the characters involved in the struggle as the fresh and interesting aspects of the movie.   <br /> <br />The context and setting works well enough...the cinematography was attractive and much time is devoted to depicting the plight of poverty and the struggle to live amidst rampant disease and lawlessness in remote Africa.  You also get a good sense of what aid workers (or anyone else helping in those regions) are up against...the numbers are so overwhelming that you know you can't help them all, but what if you can help this one right here, right now?  How do you choose which ones to help and when?  When do you bend the rules, and what are the consequences?  Thought provoking notions in refreshingly compact dialog that doesn't get too preachy. <br /> <br />Ultimately, the characters involved fail to drive the movie, and that's a problem since there's not a lot of fast-paced action happening as the coverup is unravelled (as you get in something like \\"The Bourne Identity\\"), so the characters are all you really have.  The most notable flaw is the fact that the timeline jumps around on the main characters too much for you to build an adequate sense of what they're about or to care what happens to them.  Tessa's anti-Iraq rantings felt a little too much like a trendy Hollywood copout instead of a solid backdrop for her political motivations.  Is she more interested in helping and protecting the disadvantaged?  Or simply sticking it to the establishment?  Sure, the two intersect frequently...but you never get a true sense of what is truly driving her.  Justin works a little better as the \\"Constant Gardener\\", just oblivious to everything going on under his nose until he quite passively uncovers Tessa's involvment inthe drug testing coverup and decides to finish what she started to honor her memory.  But still, he does it with far less punch than other memorable wife-avenging widowers like \\"Braveheart\\" and \\"The Fugitive\\".   <br /> <br />While a somewhat interesting movie, this is not one you'll ever pull back off the shelf again.
B000EGDC14|5.0|As a 57 year old music junkie, I was beginning to think that innovation would not strike again in my lifetime, but I am simply blown away by Goldfrapp.  She simply oozes sex, and takes electric to a level I never dreamed of.  I just hope they get more main stream exposure.  I want people to know what is out there.  The appearance on Letterman really helped the cause.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Echoing pretty much everything that the 2000+ folks have said already. This is really an amazing series and just such a shame it ends so soon by the 14th episode - it leaves you crying out for more..but sadly there is no more.
B00002E23E|5.0|First and formost, there can only be one. One concert dvd and its called \\"The Song Remains The Same\\". If you grew up in the LZ era, and you were a FAN, then you went to the movies at midnight to see this tour and you hoped the theater let the movie finish all the way! You sat until the credits had rolled, then totally spent from air guitaring in front of the screen to the movie audience you went home...with very little voice left. That's how I experienced it, 50 times along with a pretty packed theater full of rockers. If you missed this experience...Meybe you should write a review of something else, since the whole point of the fantasy sequences will be lost on you. As will the blind emotion of feeling a part of it. Looking through the eye of Jimmy Page as he takes you into his dark world from who he is to where he started , Plant eating the mushroom and telling of his trails and travesties \\"I felt the coldness of my winters...I thought, it would never go\\"...Jonesy out for a days work dealing with the demons of who pull him away from those closest to him. And Bonzo, Truly a drummer in his mentality, linear...black and white with a little psychedelia...and fun! The rest of the movie is there to give you insight about what happens in a tour. It does this. The two kids getting in... Later this would inspire a movie called Detroit Rock City.  The wasted groupies watching the limos drive away, another movie called \\"Almost famous\\". The roadies  making a little on the side. The bouncers not being all bad. Peter Grants struggles to control the concert machine. One of the best shots ever was of the NYC cop being transformed from a pig, there to keep these kids in line, to an awestruck man wondering what the hell was going on. Its indellibly etched upon my mind. {and his} The mounted police saying \\"lotta fun lotta fun\\" as they rethink their image and actions in front of a camera. The woman shown in the audience reaches that place she's been striving for in her buzz as theystart to play. You get to see Led Zeppelin play a song for 26 minutes for christs sake. You really get to SEE Led Zeppelin! What more can you ask? This movie is not an editors choice... What were some of the other reviewers thinking?! It is the Fans choice though. Who wants to see or hear a perfectly edited LIVE concert? Isn't that an oxymoron? I ONLY recommend this tape footage for people who at least occasionally leave their terminals. Get on LZ airways..take a trip for a couple of hours. Jump off when you miss 2006. ROCK 'n ROLL!
0316172324|3.0|Gladwell was on to something, and then he fell short of delivery when he vacillated with his latter stories and analogies. I think he should have sat longer on this before wrapping the writing up and publishing what looks to be unready. I found it to be weak in foundation and annoyingly confusing. If you have all the money to waste buy it, otherwise, look into more solid titles to spend your cash on.
B000FDFVZ6|3.0|The novel started out in a fast-paced, haunting description of Susie Salmon's rape and murder, which was powerful enough to make me wince. Gradually, the book began losing its momentum and twisted at places which didn't require a turn of events. I was simply confused when Susie's mother committed adultery with Detective Len Fenerman, and began to read with frustration---why in the world did Mrs. Salmon choose this particular point in time to become a \\"woman\\"? There was another part in the book which knit my eyebrows considerably---Susie falling from the sky, taking over Ruth Connors' body, and engaging in sexual intercourse with Ray Singh. Huh?  <br /> <br />I particularly liked the beginning and ending of the book, but despised what was in the middle. I guess the only thing which kept me from putting down the book eternally, was that I was doing this for a book report. The book DID have some good moments, such as when Mr. Salmon tries to explain that Susie was dead to her 5 year old brother, Buckley.  <br /> <br />This book was extremely hard to do a book report on because it had too many characters and too many conflicts, but I'd recommend it to you if you're just plain bored.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|\\"City of Evil\\" was my first introduction to Avenged Sevenfold.  The CD looked interesting enough so I picked it up without hearing a single song.  My first impression was that I liked it.  I didn't love it, but there was something about this band that was intriguing me.  I decided to pick up the earlier releases and was shocked to find such a different sound on them.  At first, I liked those a lot more than this album, but the more and more I listened to \\"City of Evil,\\" the more and more I fell in love with it.<br /><br />Having a completely different singing style sound, having more melodic riffs to accompany stronger song craft while still keeping that heavy edge that they're known for, Avenged Sevenfold gets rid of their emo look and feel and strive to come up with something better, something stronger.  I believe they accomplished that.  The songs on this album are like short stories.  Instead of the \\"life is horrible\\" or \\"kill me now\\" vibe that you would've expected from them on their earlier releases, they have written stronger songs with different meanings.  \\"Strength of the World\\" is constructed like something you'd expect from an old Western--a man coming home to find his family murdered, and swearing revenge on the killers responsible.  \\"M.I.A.\\" appears to be very much influenced by the ongoing war we're dealing with, as it tells the story of a soldier coping with his feelings after everything is all said and done.<br /><br />And other songs... well, they're just amazing to listen to.  \\"Bat Country\\" is a tribute to the late Hunter S. Thompson, and \\"Betrayed\\" is dedicated to the murdered Dimebag Darrell.  All of the songs have haunting lyrics and lines that stay in your head long after the song is done.  The guitars sound fantastic and the drumming even sounds improved over the other releases.<br /><br />People who loved the old Avenged Sevenfold may be put off by the lead singer's new approach.  He doesn't have that \\"death-metal\\" like scream that can be found on the other releases.  This may put off some people, but I have to say I like the new style.  It fits the content of the songs, giving them more life and depth than it would if he were just screaming non-stop.<br /><br />The entire album is great from start to finish.  It's hard to listen to it out of order, so rarely do I do that.  I start on the first track and play it all the way through.  My most favorites, however, are \\"burn it down,\\" \\"bat country,\\" \\"trashed and scattered,\\" \\"the wicked end\\" and \\"strength of the world.\\"  Again, all are great but those are my favorites.  I especially love the lyrics in \\"the wicked end.\\"  There's a part of it towards the end where it sounds like something Danny Elfman would have composed.<br /><br />\\"City of Evil\\" is a complete success in my eyes.  It's not one that you can listen to just once and then give out your verdict.  Let it consume you.  Play it again and again.  Get lost in the songs, the lyrics and the melody.  It won't be a winner to all but if you're looking for something different, I highly recommend it.  Try to act like you're not going to have a line or two stick in your head after the CD is done playing  -Michael Cranebe found on the other releases.

B00028HBKM|5.0|The Passion is an awesome, thought-provoking film.  I've never been so moved by a movie in my life.  It starts off with Jesus getting tempted by Satan, then goes on to show his betrayal by Judas Iscariot, who later hangs himself out of guilt.  I was amazed at how fairly the villains were portrayed, mostly Judas and Pilate.  They weren't evil charicatures, they were real people and their motivations, whether or not you agreed with them, could be understood.  And when Jesus is dragging his cross to Calvary and we see that Satan is still tempting him--pure genius.  I never thought about it that way!   <br />The focus of the movie seems to be the physical suffering Jesus endured to save his people, and while it's probably somewhat exaggerated (I don't remember anything in the New Testament about that whip thingy with the metal spikes on the end of it) it's still painful to watch. <br />It answers a lot of questions, but the most important still remains: if Jesus played baseball, would he be a pitcher or a batter?  I'm leaning toward batter.  He was a carpenter after all, and all those years swinging a hammer would probably translate well to swinging a bat.  And, as we know from that part in the Bible where He gets all mad at those people selling stuff in the church and starts knocking over their booths, he had pretty good upper body strength.   <br />Don't get me wrong.  I'm not being sacriligious.  It's just one of those things I wonder about, like did Buddha smoke and would the prophet Mohammed pose for a charicature? <br />Again, don't get me wrong.  A powerful and thought-provoking story it is, but it needs baseball.  Maybe Mel Gibson could make a sequel that has baseball, but then that creates another question.  Would Jesus play for the Angels, or would that be an insult? <br />
B00006879E|5.0|This is probably the best album I have ever listened to. It is definitely worth buying a copy. Maroon5 not only delivers some of the best music I've heard in a while, but they are truly 100% original. You really have to love that. What's really the only problem here is that Maroon5 is virtually unknown, and they just haven't gotten the attention they deserve since Songs About Jane was released a few years ago. <br />What's great about this album is that the lyrics, the vocals, and the musical composition all come together to create this incredible collection of music. Each song on this album tells a different story and every song's lyrics are outstanding. The emotional impact I got from the separate feel of each song was totally unexpected. The musical arrangements are phenomonal, if not better. But the standout of this album was the incredible voice of Adam Levine (who is rather hot as well). Adam's vocal ability for pure emotion and simply his talent truly make the album the treasure it is. He brings so much to the band, you can't help but appreciate him. <br />I loved every single track on this CD, because each song has its own feel to it and its own groove that you can really get into. If I had to pick a few of my absolute favorites, they would be: <br />track 6-The Sun <br />track 5-Tangled <br />track 10-Through With You <br />track 11-Not Coming Home <br />track 4- She Will Be Loved <br />Now, to quickly go over each song individually: <br />1-Harder To Breathe-great beat, lyrics, and vocals. This song makes for a really good single. <br />2-This Love-This song is catchy, and is also good for airplay. The music to it is also great. <br />3-Shiver-A very different composition. I liked how original this track was, and Adam's vocals sounded great with the flow of the song. <br />4-She Will Be Loved-An amazing song. People of all different musical tastes should appreciate this song-it truly is a masterpiece. <br />5-Tangled-I liked the way this song plays out, with a nice tune to it. A great track to the album. <br />6-The Sun-A phenomonal song. The chorus, especially, in this song, is what stood out for me. Beautifully written, and the vocals were, again, in a word, amazing. <br />7-Must Get Out-I really enjoyed the lyrics to this song. It was very unique-it's a nice slow song to listen to on this album. <br />8-Sunday Morning-Another good, catchy tune that people will love. The music and singing on this track is also good. <br />9-Secret-A nice song-I enjoyed how this track suddenly changed the course of the whole album as I was listening to it. It has a very different feel to it. Good lyrics, too. <br />10-Through With You-I absolutely loved this song.Taking the lyrics, melody, and catchy chorus to heart, this ong instantly became one of my absolute favorites. Great, great song. <br />11-Not Coming Home-This was the only track on the album recorded live. It really adds to the song, maybe even making it better than its original. I love the way this song is composed-the music arrangements were also excellent. <br />12-Sweetest Goodbye-What an awesome song. This is one of Maroon5's best tracks. Lovely melody, and such beautiful lyrics. This is a nice close to the already outstanding album! <br />So to sum it all up, this is a must-buy album. The whole entire CD, I think, is a collection of great music worth remembering. Honestly, Songs About Jane is such an amazing album that everyone should listen to. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this CD to anyone who would like to hear some of the best (if not THE BEST) music out there. And really, Maroon5 is just a downright incredible band that truly deserves to be recognized in the music industry. You have to hear this to believe it!
B000EULJLU|4.0|Seldom does a human brave the vast inner world of their own psyche.  Maynard James Keenan fearlessly dives into himself, rips the doors from their hinges, finds light in the darkness and brings it back to the surface.  He'll deliver it to you on a voice that could make angels cry.  His teammates in Tool back him seamlessly with the passionate melodies and rythms that drive the journey home.    Perhaps the naysayers here aren't ready for such an honest look at what goes on inside the mind.  Perhaps it has never occurred to them that true artistry, like the artistry displayed on 10,000 Days, is merely a translation of the soul's continuing process of understanding.  Whether it be in the intensely personal lyrics of Maynard James Keenan, or the visionary paintings of Alex Grey, the cover artist, or the ever-enlightening rythms of Danny Carey, true artistry IS the personal journey of one human brought to the masses to help them on their own journeys.    Perhaps if you get through a few listens of this album, with songs like Wings For Marie and 10,000 Days (listen closely), and you still don't see this, you aren't ready to see.
B00005JOE8|3.0|Alright, alright.  It's kind of entertaining.  It starts off pretty good, but the second half kind of trails off.  I'm getting tired of the gay agenda and I'm already tired of Hollywood assuming everyone is naturally prejudiced.  I mean, come on!  Stop insulting us!  And more importantly, stop messing with out minds! <br />We have our own beliefs.  We don't need yours. <br />Whatever happened to movies like Die Hard and Con Air where things got blown up and the good guys always won?  Those were entertaining.  V for Vendetta isn't.  The director focuses more on making it all arty and pretty.  It's like a big f'ing moving painting!   <br />Stuff blows up, but they try to make it artistic by playing music during it.  And it's so unrealistic too.  For those kinds of explosions to happen, V would had to have put explosives inside the buildings, not under them.  They expect us to believe anything they tell us, and that's insulting.  <br />And it needed baseball.  I mean, come on!  Don't they play baseball in the future?  And how has the game evolved?  If V played baseball, would he be a pitcher or a batter?  These are the questions that need to be explored, because they're the questions that shape our world.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|First off, let me be honest and state that I'm not a real Madonna fan. What I mean is that even though I've liked several of her songs over the years like, Power of Goodbye, Frozen Spanish eyes and Like a Prayer, to name a few; I never bought any of those records...I never really bothered to for reasons that I honestly don't know... and now along comes her latest effort, \\"Confessions on a dance floor,\\" and suddenly I was compelled to go out and get it after hearing the first two singles, Hung Up and Sorry... and I had also read some of the reviews on Amazon which peaked my interest even further and so I went out and bought this record... and I am enjoying it over and over again! <br /> <br />This album is simply wonderful! It's a dance record. All of the tracks are upbeat and fun, which makes for great listening. Dance music is where Madonna's true talent lies.... I mean her ballads are nice also but she really knows how to work dance tracks and make them infectious to the point where you find yourself really listening and singing along with every track... and before you know it, you've lost track of time having been listening to this music and being sucked into Madonna's world repeatedly. <br /> <br />In terms of lyrics, the album isn't deep but they are fun and that makes the songs all the more enjoyable. In fact, sometimes the lyrics are downright ridiculous... I don't like cities, but I like New York. Other places make me feel like a dork... she sings on the Track I Love New York... but hey come on its all in the fun! That's what makes this album fun...the fact that its lighthearted and upbeat and purely entertaining, and we can always use a little more fun in our lives! <br /> <br />Every track here is great and addictive but my favorites include; Hung Up, Sorry, Forbidden Love, and Push. Even though these songs are not deep lyrically does it mean that there aren't stories and messages in them, because Madonna finds ways to get her messages across while maintaining that light atmosphere.  On the track Jump she talks about her experiences in life and finding your way in life, On How High she talks about her rise to fame and her experiences and her reflecting on her life and career, and as we all know weather you are a true Madonna fan or not, she is a person who likes to push the envelope and just try new things, she likes to keep people guessing and wondering about her sometimes that that being said there is the track called Isaac on here that I've heard people talking about... honestly I don't really know what it's about but it sounds fantastic....it has a kind of religious tone to it I think, so I won't be surprised if someone starts to complain about it...but for me its just another great track on this album. The final track on here ends the album on a fitting note, on \\"Like it or Not\\" she takes on the haters saying \\" This is who I am, you can like it or not, you can love me or leave me cuz I'm never gonna stop,\\" which I think is self explanatory, and true to Madonna's style and character.  <br /> <br />The album consists of 12 tracks but it really doesn't seem that way...it plays continuously from track to track uninterrupted, until the final track closes which is a nice touch and suitable for a dance record such as this. <br /> <br />When it comes down to it I think both hardcore Madonna fans, newbies or just the curious sort will love this record... if you cant get the current singles out of your head then this album is for you! If you're just curious but hesitating for whatever reason... I urge you to give this album a try or at the very least try to find <br />someone who owns it and give it a spin.... I'm sure you'll like what you hear... I sure do!! <br /> <br />
0525948023|5.0|In the book A New Earth Awakening To Your Life Purpose written by Eckhart Tolle, Eckhart provides a brilliant introduction to the opening of Oneness with the Universe. On a rating scale of one to five I would rate this book at 100 (highly above a 5). However, I feel like the real purpose of this book is not to inform a person of the True meaning of Consciousness; it is to help a person understand that we ARE Consciousness; that we are all interconnected spiritual Beings with the same Power of the Universe. If you are looking for a \\"how to\\" book then this book will most likely be a dissappoitment; because the answers you ask are already within yourself. Ego is what prevents a person from connecting to the answers; and I feel like the message that Eckhart really wants to help provide through this book is not \\"Here is information to help you understand the relationship between Consciousness and Ego\\" but that it is \\"There is a seed of awareness that wants to take hold of your hand; you did not find this book, this book found you through my writings. Open up your mind, and join it.\\"
038572179X|3.0|Atonement is bestselling author Ian McEwan's latest novel. Atonement tells the story of 13 year old Briony Tallis. The book opens with Briony attempting to produce her childhood drama The Trials of Arabella with her cousins. Briony, is the youngest of three children and the daughter of ever absent parents Jack and Emily Tallis. Jack is a minister who works in the Home Office, and Emily tries to be there constantly for Briony but is under constant fear of severe migraines. Briony has two older siblings; Cecilia who is ten years older, and Leon who is almost twenty two years older than Briony. <br /> At the beginning of the story, Briony Tallis lives outside of London with her parents, sister and her cousins. The cousins moved in with her while their parents are going through a nasty divorce during the summer of 1935. Briony attempts to produce her play with her cousins to no avail. During these rehearsals Briony witnesses the sexual interaction between her 23 year old sister Cecilia and the gardener, Robbie Turner. Cecilia and Robbie see there relationship as normal while Briony sees it as assaulting. This leads Briony to accuse Robbie of raping her 15 year old cousin, Lola after she witnessing the raping one dark evening during the summer. Since Briony is the only witness she is vital in sending Robbie to jail. He is later allowed to join the British Expeditionary Force in France as conditions of parole. While Robbie is in jail and the army, Cecilia continues to stay in touch with him and not let there love die, but she does disconnect herself from her family. <br /> Briony continues to succeed in life and becomes a nurse, like her older sister. Briony later learns that Lola was raped by Paul Marshall, Leon Tallis's friend. After learning that she had falsely accused Robbie of the rape which Paul had in fact committed and a confrontation with her sister, Briony realizes that she must atone for her wrong doings and reveal her story to the whole world. This takes Briony nearly six decades but when she finally finishes her story she learns that she is being faced with a terminal illness and that her book will be published posthumously. In doing so, she changes the ending of the story to a happy one instead for the reality of Robbie and Cecilia both dying.  <br /> Atonement is divided up into four sections which allow the plot to develop uniquely. Part 1 focuses on the background of the story and leads up to the arrest of Robbie Turner for raping Lola Quincey. Part 2 follows Robbie while he is on parole and required to join the British Expeditionary Force in France. Part 2 allows the reader to know that Robbie is in constant contact with his true love, Cecilia Tallis, who at that point is estranged from Briony. Part 3 focuses on Briony's nurse's training in London during the war. Part 3 deals with the bombing of Dunkirk, the marriage between Lola and Paul Marshall, and Briony's confrontation with her sister about what really happened on the matter of the rape. Part 4 or \\"London 1999\\" occurs on Briony's 77th birthday. At this point the reader learns that the previous three parts are Briony's writing to try to atone for her 1935 wrong doing, told in a fictional way. <br />Atonement was written well, but it did not capture my attention one hundred percent. There were times when I couldn't put the book the down but they were outnumbered by the times that I just couldn't get into the story. However, I did enjoy the way that the story was divided and the fictional/factional aspects that were told. <br />
0679422714|1.0|I teach Chinese politics at the college level.  I assign Jung Chang's excellent autobiography, Wild Swans, to my class.  My students love it, and with good reason.  It captures the ever-changing complexities of China in the 20th century as few books can.  Therefore, I was eagerly anticipating the publication of Mao: The Untold Story.  However, not only have I been disappointed, I am appalled!  Books like this serve to dumb down the next generation of people with a casual interest in China and Mao.<br /><br />First, the book is written in a style that approximates a book-length version of a Red Guard poster.  Every sentence is a polemic.  Each paragraph is sure to remind the reader (in case he or she forgot what was written in the previous paragraph) of just how evil and horrible Mao was.  Indeed, the thesis of the books is that Mao was so horrible, that he had absolutely no redeeming qualities.  Now, no serious China scholar would disagree with the statement that Mao was an unlovable person and an increasingly poor ruler after 1958.  In this, the book does not tell us much new (and as the book gets closer to the last decade of Mao's life it becomes somewhat less egregiously inaccurate).  But denying Mao his place in history by arguing that he was simply a scheming manipulator whose monstrousness was matched only by his incompetence makes no sense.  The Chinese had many potential leaders to choose from after May 4th 1919, and the history of the CCP is full of intrigue.  Anybody who rose to the top must have been ruthless and manipulative.  But they must also have been extraordinarily competent, if only to survive.  If Mao was the imbecile that Chang and Halliday make him out to be, this could simply not have occurred.<br /><br />In addition, the book boasts a list of interviews and interviewees that is quite stunning in its scope and in terms of the incredible access obtained by the authors.  Alas, the result is an almost criminal exercise in missed opportunities.  Apart from citing Michael Caine (whom I love as an actor) as an expert on the Korean War, and the now-famous 90+ year-old woman in Luding who denied the entire Luding Bridge episode during the Long March, the authors interviewed a number of my senior colleagues in the China field.  Instead of listening to the more nuanced accounts that these scholars were attempting to provide, Chang and Halliday (according to several of these China scholars), but especially Chang, simply did not want to hear any information that contradicted her central thesis that Mao was evil and incompetent.  As a result, although these China experts are cited in the interviewee list at the back of the book, the data that they were uniquely qualified to provide did not appear in the book itself.  I will assign the book in my social science research courses as an example of how NOT to interview experts in the field.  One is reminded of the brilliant Monty Python sketch in which there is a TV show featuring as guests Karl Marx, Lenin, Che Guevara, and Mao Zedong and instead of actually holding a substantive discussion, the guests are asked to guess the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest and the nicknames of British soccer teams.  [..]<br /><br />Another serious problem in the book is that the authors reinterpret largely settled issues in 20th century China.  There is nothing wrong with revisionism per se if it provides new light on a previously misunderstood event.  Usually, however, such Perry Mason-like moments in scholarship are few and far between.  If a scholar is lucky, he or she can publish one or two books that refute the existing paradigm on a major substantive subject.  But in this book, there are dozens of such refutations.  This means that either the scholarly community got it wrong and Chang and Halliday somehow got it all right, or that Chang and Halliday played fast and loose with facts and interpretations.  Now, I am no believer of maintaining sacred cows in academia, but one cannot but be suspicious of Chang and Halliday's Oliver Stone-like approach to China scholarship, especially given what we can infer from their less-than-disinterested approach to interviewing the participants.  This book is the JFK of China studies.<br /><br />The reason why it is important to lay out the problems with this book is because Chang and Halliday have the type of access to the general reading public that most scholars can only dream of, given the success of Wild Swans and the advertising campaign that surrounded Mao: The Untold Story.  I would urge people to read The Politics of China edited by Roderick MacFarquhar or Governing China by Ken Lieberthal.  If these are too \\"dry\\" for the average reader, they should read Philip Short's Mao: A Life or Li Zhisui's The Secret Life of Chairman Mao.  [...]
0446343129|5.0|I am appalled at how the sugar industry has no concern for Americans.  I have even found sugar in Hunts tomato sauce.  One would expect to find sugar in candy, sweets and soda but to find it in most everyday prodcuts is ridiculous.  The most disturbing was realizing that it is in cigarettes. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to see how the world truly runs.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Sometimes there's nothing better than a solid classic western on a warm Saturday afternoon. I have heard all the praises of this movie but after watching it I think my opinion of this paramount achievement rose way above my expectations. <br /> <br />Great reason for watching this movie other than the simple fact how fabulous it is the quite modern story with twists and turns as things happed in the Wild Wild West . I was entertained for the whole time with no slow moments and the never ending looming spiraling staircase of misfortune and quirky scenarios that kept happening to Blondie, as they called Eastwood and Tuco, his partner in crime. Without spoiling too much all I can say is that they both know a part of a secret, of a buried treasure; two hundred thousand dollars and each one of them knows on part of the location as they realize they need to join forces and overcome their differences in order to find it. Hot on their tail is the bad guy, known as Angel Eyes who has no soul and will kill anyone who gets in his way and who is also after the treasure.  <br /> <br />Eastwood is a great bad ass tough character, with that cold intelligent stare and his favorite cigar hanging in the corner of his mouth, and when he is squaring off with an opponent you just know who is quicker and who will win. <br /> <br />Sergio Leone proves as a superb director with  flawless movie technique with short funny smart moments, fancy tricks, quick escapes and our main characters stepping on each others toes, turning against one another, trying to kill each other off until they reach their goal; the buried treasure. This movie might be almost 40 years old but its still 100% pure and solid entertainment, whether you like westerns or not, this is simply good fun. This saga of sun and gun stories involving clever characters are bound to be around for as long as movies are watched, and I promise that after watching this movie no one can feel anything other then a sense of great self worth and time well spent.
B000002542|5.0|Do not buy this album if you want to hear preppy pop hits.  This album is pure rock and roll.   <br />Journey started when Santana lead vocalist and keyboardist Gregg Rollie and Santana guitarist Neal Schon left Santana after the Caravanserai album.  Carlos and Santana drummer Michael Shrieve wanted to play more jazz influenced music, while Gregg and Neal wanted to play more of the music that made the band famous, rock and roll with afro-latin rhythms.  Consequently, Gregg and Neal split and formed their own group.  In December 31, 1973, Journey played their first gig at the Winterland in San Francisco, opening up for \\"The New Santana Band.\\"  Eventually, Journey released their self-titled debut.  You can still hear the Santana influence in this album, except without all the percussion.  This album rocks hard all the way.  Since it's mostly instrumental, you can really see the musical talent that the bandmembers have, especially Neal Schon and Gregg Rollie.  After Steve Perry came in, the music became much more lyrical, and Neal Schon's breathtaking guitar was mostly heard as backup, and keyboards were used only for emotional effects, as opposed to being a driving force of the music, as heard in this album. <br />If you want to hear great classic rock with plenty of guitar and Hammond Organ flourishes, buy this album.  It's an excellent album, and the great price makes it an offer not to be passed up.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Absolutely the best movie of 2005!!! Granted I'm totally biased since I am an absolute fan of the \\"Firefly\\" tv series. All in all though, this movie puts the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels to shame. Lots of action, snarky dialogue, suspense and heart. One of my cousins liked this movie without knowing any of the backstory, i.e. without having to watch the series. One hopes there will be another movie made in the future. Can't stop the signal.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|Some of the reviewers claimed the plot was new, but please, I can think of at least a half dozen flicks in the same vein without even trying.  Nevermind, the point is I paid zero attention to this film at the time, assuming anything with Aston Kutcher in it had to be a joke, and the critics certainly helped.  So I was channel surfing today, caught this about ten minutes in and was hooked, watched it to the end.  Hey, Kutcher's not a bad actor at all, in fact he was quite good, likable, engaging and in character throughout.  Surprise, surprise.<br /><br />The film was also quite good, in the top quartile of these time travel / is it real or a dream type movies.  It's a tired theme, but it was well put together, nicely acted and had a reasonably satisfying conclusion, although cliched.  I think a \\"Pet Semetary\\" type twist would have been cooler, but I bet the somewhat sunny ending passed the audience test much better.
B00004VYQ5|4.0|This is an offbeat, black comedy about a hit man, Martin Blank (John Cusack), who is undergoing some personal angst about his career choice. He sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Oatman (Alan Arkin), who, once he becomes aware of his patient's profession, wants nothing more to do with him. Moreover, a most unlikely, rival hit man (Dan Ackroyd) is on his tail, looking to clear the field of a potential rival.<br /><br />What's a conflicted hit man to do? Why go to his tenth year high school reunion in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, of course. There, \\"Marty\\" plans to do his final hit and hook up with his high school sweetheart, Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), whom he unceremoniously stood up on prom night, ten years earlier. Once he gets there, however, things do not go according to plan, and \\"Marty\\" is in store for a few surprises.<br /><br />John Cusack is terrific as the hit man, playing him with just the right blend of sangfroid cool and, at other times, with all the charm of the boy next door. Dan ackroyd is funny as the unlikely, rival hit man. Alan Arkin is excellent as the shrink who does not want \\"Marty\\" as his patient. Minnie Driver is the least compelling of those cast in this film, as she adds very little to its success. Joan Cusack, John Cusack's real life sibling, more than makes up for the gap left by Driver, however, as she infuses the role of Marcella, \\"Marty's\\" gal friday, with enough pizazz to shore up the film.<br /><br />All in all this is a surprisingly entertaining film. Unfortunately, the DVD offers next to nothing by way of special features. Do not, however, let this deter you from buying this funny and unusual film.
0765315246|1.0|\\"Old Man's War\\" is a trite, weakly written novel that barely qualifies as science fiction. The characters are aging people from earth who are transformed into hyper-soldiers to fight aliens. The science (I'm a hard core devote) is absent or implausible, and the action is a series of chiches. For example, at boot camp the sargent delivers a brutal speech about the horrors of war, ho-hum.
B000F48CD8|4.0|As a huge White Stripes fan, when I heard that Jack White was joining up with Brendan Benson, \\"Little Jack\\" Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler, I thought, \\"Hey, he can do what he wants. Nothing wrong with a side project.\\" So when Steady, As She Goes and Store Bought Bones became available for download, I listened and came to the conclusion that they were good and this album would probably be good enough to hold me over until The White Stripes came back from their temporary hiatus. <br /> <br />But the more I listened to them, the more I liked them, especially Store Bought Bones. I started to look more into them and became more interested. I got a few bootlegs, most notably their 3rd-ever concert from Newcastle on 3/22/06, and I started to really anticipate this album. <br /> <br />The clips and bootlegs I heard were really starting to sound awesome, and soon I was almost creaming myself in anticipation. I finally got the album the other day, and I am left speechless. <br /> <br />Not really. If I was left speechless, I wouldn't be typing this. But I was amazed. I could no longer think of this has \\"Jack's little side project.\\" The energy and time put into these songs are amazing, and every single song delivered. When I listened to the album the whole way through the first time, I had to listen to it again! <br /> <br />1. Steady, As She Goes - The first single from this album has amazing staying power. It doesn't get old, at least not in my mind. Every time I hear it is like hearing it for the first time. The only difference is that I like it a lot more now! Great vocal deliveries and a catchy bass line. <br /> <br />2. Hands - This was one of my favorite songs from the bootlegs, especially the live video version that's available here on Amazon. I like this album version a LOT too, although it's a tiny bit slower. But that doesn't detract from it. The harmonies are awesome, and it gets stuck in my head frequently. <br /> <br />3. Broken Boy Soldier - The title track is oneof, if not my single favorite song on the album. You could close your eyes and swear this is a long-lost Zeppelin song. From the funky acoustic guitars to Jack's searing vocal delivery, it screams Zeppelin. Everything about this song is perfect! <br /> <br />4. Intimate Secretary - Another one of my favorite songs on the album. Playful lyrics and playful vocal delivery. The harmonies between Brendan and Little Jack in the verses sound friggin awesome, and Jack sounds great in the chorus. This song is really a group effort, and you can't help but sing along with the childish lyrics (I got a rabbit who likes to hop / I got a girl and she likes to shop / The other foot looks like it won't drop / I had an uncle and he got shot). Very Beatles-esque. <br /> <br />5. Together - A great ballad with Brendan and Jack trading off vocals. The lyrics are decent, if not a bit cliched at times, and everyone sounds in top form. <br /> <br />6. Level - I dare anyone to listen to this and even TRY not to rock out. An insanely catchy keyboard beat with burning guitars. The solos between Jack and Brendan are, for lack of a better word, awesome. The vocals, once again, sound great! <br /> <br />7. Store Bought Bones - This one really catches your ear. Patrick's drum beat, which changes throughout the whole song, is insanely infectious. It's one of his finest moments on the whole disc. The harmonizing is almost haunting in a way, but they are great. Everybody gets a chance to solo at the end, a great way to end a great song. <br /> <br />8. Yellow Sun - It's hard not to bob your head to this bright, sunny song (no pun intended). This is also very Beatles sounding, if not as much as Intimate Secretary. The whole song has a nice feel to it, and it will instantly put you in a good mood. <br /> <br />9. Call It A Day - Another good ballad from Brendan. I really like the lyrics in this one, and Brendan's voice is really nice. The background vocals sound a bit colorless at first, but you kindof get used to them, and they don't sound so bad after a while. The song is also a bit repetitive, but it doesn't take too much away. Overall, maybe the weakest song on the disc, but still a very worthy one and not one to skip over. <br /> <br />10. Blue Veins - One of the best blues songs written in a while. Jack's voice sounds in top form here, and there's a pretty cool backwards section in the middle (although I personally prefer the solos they do in concert). A good way to end the album. <br /> <br />I was just blown away by this album. I've listened to it about 10 times in the past 2 days, and I love it every time. This isn't just a silly side project by any means. The Raconteurs take themselves seriously in their music, and it shows. If this is what we have to hold us over while we wait for the next Stripes album, I won't be complaining for a minute. Don't miss this.
B000001DYD|5.0|RID OF ME was PJ Harvey's sophomore effort and hands down, my favorite album of all time.  Truly!  I wish I could convey just how excellent this album is and how much it's changed my life but alas, words can never describe the experience of the wave of emotion and longing this album will hit you with.  Even now, over a decade later, my heart still skips a beat whenever I anticipate hearing this CD.  It is that good.<br /><br />A lot of people describe this album as raw, noisy, angry and uncompromising.  And while that may be true enough, I think it is also profound, deeply passionate and to me, storytelling at its best.  The songwriting is superb, with topics we can all relate to, ranging from unrequited love to religious references to feminism to (attempted, anyway) murder.  Throw in Steve Albini's signature raw, stripped-to-the-core touch and we have this flawless of a record.  All the songs flow beautifully together, yet each song can hold its own.  I'm tempted to go through every song because honestly the whole album is fantastic but that would mean a review ten pages long and I know no one wants that, so I'm just gonna highlight a few songs that are extra special to me.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the song \\"Rid of Me\\" and what a great title track this is.  Starts off slow with a bit of guitar but by the end, it'll have you screaming from the top of your lungs, \\"Don't you wish you, NEVER, NEVER MET HER?!!\\"  This song is about a love affair gone sour and a desperate woman pleading and plotting for her lover to return but to no avail.<br /><br />\\"Missed\\" is such a beautiful, melodic, sorta downtempo song.  One cannot help but be moved by this song.  It is somewhat out of place on this album, I think, just like \\"Plants and Rags\\" seemed out of place on DRY.  Nevertheless, it's a great song.  PJ's vocals is especially effective here, lending to the lush, surreal vibe of the song and the lyrics are very heartfelt, supposedly about Mother Mary and how she went mad over her son's Crucifixion.<br /><br />\\"Legs\\" is awesome!  It is a jilted lover's anthem!  Such a wickedly intense song, from the opening crooning of, \\"OOOOOOhhhh, you're divinnnnne...\\" to the sinister last lines, \\"I might as well be dead.  But I could kill you instead.\\"  The lyrics are most powerful in this song, I think, with words like, \\"I'll bet you never thought I'd try.  Your mouth my love, was open wide... Got to ease my aching head.  Do you know, no other way, cut off your legs...\\"<br /><br />\\"Man-Size Sextet\\" is a two minute masterpiece of extra creepy strings and organs.  Think raised hair.<br /><br />\\"50ft Queenie\\" I call my therapeutic song.  It is one of my favorites to see live, with the mad high low beats merging with the crazy fast and fun lyrics.  I really feel a need to jump up and down and shout along with the words, \\"Hey now I'm the King of the world, you oughta hear my song.  You come and measure me, I'm twenty inches long!..\\"<br /><br />One of my favorite PJ Harvey songs is \\"Yuri-G.\\"  I cannot get enough of this lil' ditty!  \\"She's so white, she's so clean.  I'm telling you, she's everything.  I'd give it all, my sorry eyes, give just everything, she's got me so mesmerized..\\"  This song (I think) is about being envious of the moon and how exquisite it is, and pays homage to Yuri Gagarin, a Russian astronaut and the first man to orbit the earth.<br /><br />Ah, then we get to the most excellent of songs, \\"Man-Size.\\"  Oh Polly, thank you for gracing us with this amazing song.  I love to sing along with the lyrics because this song really help put things in perspective.  Told from a macho man's point of view, I can't help but get a sense of harrumph, well, a bit of penis envy, I suppose:<br /><br />\\"I'll measure time, I'll measure height<br /><br />I'll calculate my birth right<br /><br />Good Lord I'm big, I'm heading on<br /><br />Man-sized<br /><br />Got my leather boots on<br /><br />Got my girl, she is a WOW<br /><br />I cast my iron knickers down<br /><br />My babe looking cool and neat<br /><br />I'm pretty sure good enough to eat<br /><br />Man-sized, no need to shout<br /><br />Let it all, let it all hang out!<br /><br />I'm MAN SIZE! MAN SIZE! MAN SIZE!\\"<br /><br />The album ends with a few more great songs such as \\"Dry,\\" the excellent track \\"Me-Jane\\" and \\"Ecstasy.\\"  As I mentioned, there is not a bad song on this album, and depending on the day, I still discover bits about the record that's more brilliant than I remembered it to be.  I've just about worn out my copy, as I play it so often but yet somehow I never seem to tire of this CD.  And I doubt I ever will.  It is that good.wn <br />My babe looking cool and neat <br />I'm pretty sure good enough to eat <br />Man-sized, no need to shout <br />Let it all, let it all hang out! <br />I'm MAN SIZE! MAN SIZE!

0767812166|3.0|According to one website, the original script for Starman was written by the actor Michael Brandon (Dempsey and Makepeace) and was bought by Universal. the studio changed the script and didn't give Brandon any credit. If this is true, it's a complete shame, because the ideas are what makes this film so compelling.<br />Carpenter, at a certain point in his career started to make bland movies. It's not hard to understand that he couldn't keep the level of classics such as The Fog, Halloween or the superior remake of The Thing. But Memories of an Invisible Man and Village of the Damned could have been directed by an average director. These are films for the familiy on a sunday afternoon.<br />But Starman is a bit different. Jeff Bridges gives an exceptional performance as the alien - which was nominated for an academy award. i don't know who won in 84, but if Bridges had won it wouldn't surprise anyone. Karen Allen is a great actress - she played aopposite Harrison Ford in Raiders and she doesn't get overshadowed by the lead actor - quite a feat in both of these movies.<br />Starman is a good film, maybe a great one, if one forgets it's not typical of Carpenter: it's politically correct, the opposite of The Thing, for instance. the direction is not the strong point in Starman, one almost forgets it's Carpenter's. But he does his job.
068484267X|5.0|I read Angela's Ashes in less than two days.  I read another book, America Hates Me but I still Love Her in less than a day.  That book, by Umut Ozturk, is another autobiography.  Like Angela's Ashes, it's a tale of a young boy growing into a man in a world he doesn't always understand.  Both of these books are now two of my favorites.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Loved this album from the day it came out. I'm a huge System of a Down fan, and enjoy every one of their albums enormously. To me, they are one of the fastest, most precise bands out there with both personality and a real, genuine idea of melody.     For me, System of a Down keeps getting better. With each of their albums, there's been a crisper, cleaner production. Progressively, Tankian's vocals have faded just a bit to make room for guitarist Malakian's high pitched squeals. Guitars are more pronounced, as well as vocal choruses, and both the drums and bass have taken a backseat. Everything just sounds more systematic, exact, and coherent. Some people don't like this; I do.    Mesmerize is slicker than any of the band's previous albums. Lyrically, it succeeds mostly because it has a less direct expression of ideas than, say, Toxicity. While, I think, the album doesn't ever really reach a sense of lyric profundity (which I think System does now and then and I understand others would fight to the death on that), it also takes its tongue-in-cheek mentality to an even higher level, abandoning most forms of seriousness for an almost circus-like energy and grotesque theatricality. The worst lyrics System has ever wrote have been either based in trite, all-too-obvious political/world criticism, or lame, Eastern-inspired duality/psychology/whatever you want to call it. Not that Mesmerize doesn't say anything -- because it does -- but it seems equally as confident, with something that doesn't betray it's own confidence out of stupidity.    Oh yeah, this is a pop album. Can't name a catchier disc of 2005. It's hard, too; I don't understand those who claim that System's older stuff was \\"SO MUCH HARDER WTF!!!!!!\\". This is poppier than \\"Steal this Album\\" but just as tough, and \\"Toxicity\\" for me seems like it had the smallest balls of the bunch, but that was probably due to a muted production. Their debut album is the only one that qualifies as harder to me because it's both raw and loud.    Anyway I've written so much that I've bored myself. This is a great album with brilliant highs (BYOB, Question!) and a few average lows (Sad Statue, Old School Hollywood)... Wow what a pathetic conclusion.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|Dune Lost!  <br />Some years ago in the by gone days when Laser Discs were KING. I found a copy of the Japanese Release of DUNE Laser Disc box set. As I remember it contained two releases 137 minutes and 189 minutes. I have always regretted letting that one get by me. My only excuse was I believe it cost over $100.   <br /> <br />Dune Found!  <br />I must say DUNE is one Film I can't get enough of. After multiple viewings I always come away with something new. One of the most unnerving things I've found is how the universe of Dune parallel current events 20 years later here on Earth. Frank Herbert's use of language is worth a study alone. In many ways oil is our spice! I can't say I even have a favorite version both of the current releases are wonderful in thier own right. The special effects are always spectacular and outclass many films today. <br />My only complaint about Dune (Extended Edition) is it comes up short on extra - features especially a running commentary!

B000DWMN2S|5.0|I picked this film on a whim at the video store- it looked quirky and smart, by the cover art and story summary. And it was a bonus to see Elijah Wood as the main character.<br /><br />It started off a little slow- I was worried when I caught my mind wandering a bit. This was the instant-gratification-gotta-have-it-now Amercian ADHD consumer in me needing to just chill out. Once I did, I was totally awed by the beautiful, artistic cimetography. The well placed \\"white space\\" in the dialog. The kind of sadly true humor. And I was heartbroken at the end.<br /><br />I don't go around looking for personal and profound meaning in every movie I see or book I read. But I think you'll find that if you sit quietly and let this film carry you, you'll be changed by the end.<br /><br />To me a good movie is one that sticks in my mind long after I've seen it. Little snips of scenes bubble up in my memory at random moments. This is one of those movies.
B000002O1P|4.0|first off i would just tell you that tom petty and the heartbreakers are by far my favorite band ever and i think they are the greatest thing to ever happen to music.  better then elvis, the beatles, dylan, the stones or anybody else i realize these artist have had a huge impact on music and petty as well but in my mind their is no one better then tom petty and the heartbreakers.  having said that while this album is enjoyable i can not say it is his best in fact in my opinion it is probably his worst.  that doesn't really say much though since most artist would be thrilled to have an album this good and i would rather listen to this then 95% of all other music.  this album is definitly worth owning as are all of petty's albums.  now to the music. i like all the songs on this album and as already said in previously reviews this is probably his most diverse album which kinda makes it a collection of songs rather then an album.  it doesn't flow together like an album.  it's more just listening to some songs written at the same period of his career.  so basically if you like petty at all give this a chance.  you might be surprised.  and hey a bad (or should i say not as good) petty album still beats pretty much anything else.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day delivers an amazing life changing cd in American Idiot. 9 minute jesus of surburbia the second track on the album is amazing and will send you into a great story and sends a wonderful message to the listeners. this cd changed my life and will change the lives of many people who listen to it. the people who dont like it are the ones who are offended by the album title \\"american idiot\\" the music is brilliant. Green Day is one of the best live bands in the history of music, and their Dookie cd sold over 10 million copies. American Idiot was platinum in 8 other countries around the world, and hit gold in 5 others, the cd sold over 2 million copies just in the US alone. anybody who bashes this band only does it because they are offended by the lyrics and the album title \\"american idiot\\" its a character, thats it, this cd is incredible from start to finish. Jesus Of surburbia is the best song on the cd. St jimmy is amazing as well and it wont get as much attention as the other songs, but its a great number 6. everybody hurry and buy this cd, and experience the wonderful ride
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This was a different direction for Disney in that it's not a musical, and it's a throwback to the silly cartoons of the fifties.  The story, the voice actors, and the style/design all work.<br /><br />I laugh every time I watch this movie. The villain trying to poison the emperor, the henchman humming his own theme music, the chipmunk, the scene at the restaurant.... It doesn't stop.<br /><br />If you're a fan of classic/retro animation or just enjoy a big laugh, you'll love this.

This is a win-win book. The ideas contained in it, if properly applied, could improve our economy and enhance our freedom at the same time.
0812976525|2.0|I was unpleasantly surprised by this book.Reading it before I saw the movie, I didn't like it.With a lack of dialogue, it seems that the the story moves slowly, not really going anywheree.One of the only things I did like about it was the subject matter, drawing readers in to something they see regularly in Washington. I wasn't happy with the lack of character interaction, there was definetly alot more telling by Buckley than showing, he needed to let the story just tell itself throught dialogue and character interaction.I was really expecting something better in this book.
0553213105|5.0|Although this is my first Jane Austen novel (I started Emma but returned it to the library after a boring few pages), it suprisingly was a fun read.  I admit I read this because of the movie and the BBC miniseries, but even watching both does not give the full story behind Pride and Prejudice.  The book can be boring at a few scenes, namely, Mr. Collins, but whenever we read Elizabeth's and Darcy's banter, it makes it all more worthwhile.  Definitely recommend the book if you enjoy the movie/BBC series.
B000ESST6U|5.0|First performed 20 February 1724 and frequently revived thereafter during Handel's lifetime, Giulio Cesare, like all of his operas, fell into obscurity for 2 centuries. Supposedly, they were uninteresting to a modern audience and unperformable by modern performers. Recent scholarship proved the absurdity of this mistaken viewpoint. Handel's operas are joining his oratorios in the repertory with Cesare probably most performed along with Serse.<br /><br />Cleopatra made a star of Beverly Sills. I think it may do the same for the uncommonly beautiful Danielle de Niese whose stunning appearance and rich soprano fill the Glyndebourne stage with that ineffable quality called 'starpower'. Glyndebourne and Opus Arte must agree because they showcase Ms. de Niece in a 30 minute documentary on disc 1 called 'Danielle de Niece and the Glyndebourne experience'! In it, appealing to the under 30 audience is explicitly discussed. Every aspect of this staging of Cesare is created with that mission in mind. Another documentary film included in the set is 'Entertainment is not a dirty word'. If you can deal with all this, you will enjoy this 3 disc DVD immensely. I found this performance funny, entertaining, inventive, a little glitzy (in a good way) and well sung. On the negative side, I found it slightly weaker dramatically but with some absorbing tragic singing from Angelika Kirschlager as Sesto and Patricia Bardon as Sesto's mother Cornelia. Sarah Connolly makes a fine Cesare. Christopher Maltman is a standout Achilla. The cast is quite good and they appear to be enjoying themselves. In a 4 hour opera that is probably helpful.<br /><br />William Christie is a superb conductor of Baroque opera. He has been joining his talents to productions that emphasize a more modern sensibilty. Some purists wonder where the real heart of Baroque opera is when singers cavort onstage in slinky Flapper dresses and designer sunglasses. I can live with it if the music is well performed: as it is here by the superb Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. But even open-minded laissez-faire opera fans (like me) would like to see a real Baroque opera performed as written one day. This is a vastly entertaining production. The costumes are beautiful. The stagecraft and sets are brilliantly conceived. There is a wonderful wave machine with 19th Century ships-of-war at the rear of a Baroque-style stage. A harvest moon with stars glimmers in the sky. It is quite lovely. And the music by Handel is pretty good, too.<br /><br />This 3 DVD set is NTSC all regions shot in 16/9 true anamorphic widescreen in high definition. It looks beautiful. Sound is recorded in LPCM stereo and 5.1 DTS Digital Surround Sound. Both are crystal clear with DTS providing terrific immediacy and presence to the sound. You feel like you're there. Subtitles are in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. Menus are in English. There are numerous extras: including the films mentioned, an illustrated plot synopsis, a cast gallery, production and rehearsal photos. The 48 page enclosed booklet is glossy, beautiful and informative. Total running time of the DVDs is 305 minutes. Another superb Opus Arte release.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully entertaining modern production with a great Baroque opera at its heart. If you can deal with the anachronisms and glitz, you will love it. If you're a purist, be forewarned. Strongly recommended.<br /><br />Mike Birmanrchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.

B000EULJLU|3.0|I'm not reading much about how Maynard's role is realy lacking from this entire album. I knew his side project would be too much for him. Hard to be in two places at once. The music sounds pretty good but it almost sounds like they're done by a tool cover band. They would've made a great instrumental band however it's kind of difficult to adjust when I've gotten so used to hearing Maynards powerful vocals and lyrics that compliment the music so well. Oh well I guess we can all wait and see what lies ahead in another 5 years. (perhaps instead of being so experimental they'll revert back to they're old selves.)That doesn't seem so bad does it?
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|rihanna was definatley not my favourite artist.... she had a hit song 'pon de replay' and everyone seemed to like it but she seemed annoying.... but then something happened.she dyed her hair and  came out with an album that was way better than her last effort. A GIRL LIKE ME is defiantley a 180. <br /> <br />rihanna shines on the ballads on the LP especially my favourite track on the album which is also the darkest song on the album. 'unfaithful' was the single that changed my opinon about her. she has a really pretty voice.  <br /> <br />'final goodbye' is very haunting and elegant, 'a million miles away' helps you feel her pain about her so-gone lover, 'we ride' is a great car jam, 'SOS' is a club banger all around, 'selfish girl' has dancehall all over it... <br /> <br />the only tracks i dont like on the album were 'break it off' and the remix to \\"if its lovin that you want' very lackluster and no place on this album... <br /> <br />it rihanna keeps this recipe up then she will have a very successful career. just keep away from duets with sean paul and everything will be alright... <br /> <br />3.8 out of 5 stars

The prose style is marvelously creative, so completely captivating that word by word, moment by moment, the story is nearly impossible to stop reading.  Each and every character becomes real, but most memorable may be the father, Hans, whose kindness and courage are inseparable.  The voice of Death, the narrator, is different from any other voice that I have heard speaking of the horrors of WWII. In the midst of tragedy, compassion remains, even in the most unexpected places.  The publisher should be marketing The Book Thief as fiction for general readers (rather than \\"young adults\\")because it deserves the widest possible audience.
B00027JZ3E|5.0|...and definately a 5 within the genre. It boasts a stellar cast(Dianne Wiest among others) with several helpings from members of the Brat Pack(Kiefer Sutherland, Corey Haim) and Jason Patric. The visual design and the soundtrack are breathtaking(indeed my teenage friends - we called ourselves the Lost Boys hehehe) and THAT`S enough said.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink hits the mark and the perfect note with this incredibly personal and personable CD.  Great from the first to the last track, Pink has outdone herself and most other artists with this CD.  Stellar vocals, excellent songwriter and fresh production make this CD a must.<br /><br />A true revealing look that you will never get if you're watching an interview from Respect, Dear Diary, Lonely Girl and Family Portrait to every song on the CD.  Pink has a pop CD of course, but the raspy blues of her vocals, especially on Misery is captivating.- To a better day in every way.  Jaci Rae
0452282152|3.0|<br /> Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier is an enjoyable and thoughtful read.  It transfers the reader into the Delft, Holland in the mid-1600s via the eyes of a young servant girl.  Pre-knowledge of the setting is not a requirement of the reader as Chevalier does a magnificent job of flawlessly explaining the setting and place with interest and history versus story transfers unnoticeably.  The story is rich with the culture without any dullness.  How does Chevalier do it?  The narration is through Griet, a reserved servant girl sold to work in the great master artist, Vermeer's home -- she is to clean his studio.  As Griet explores her new residence, unravels mysteries of the elusive artist and learns how to interact with the fragile household the reader is slowly unfolded to her new settings and the place generally.  It is written with contemporary English in a way that is formal yet simplistic and does not clash with the setting.  The setting is often serene and Griet's insightful, reserved conscience is quick, enjoyable and realistic. <br /> <br /> As I fell deeper and deeper into the story, I quickly empathized with the various characters and their reserved yet tense relationships with one another.  The tensions are of interest and do not make the reader weary.  Then the novel turns and Griet becomes closer to the artist, more knowledgeable of the family and beings a romance of her own.  These great folds of the story are beautifully written escapes rich with painting, emotion and swiftly moving plot. <br /> <br /> I highly enjoyed the novel.  When the last page had turned, I wished to visit the town again, the fish markets, the studio, the brick roads and interesting characters.  The novel isn't complicated, it is written artistically and well but does not exceed a high scholastic level.  I believe young adults as early as junior high could fully appreciate and understand the novel.  However, the novel could easily peak the interest any age beyondit.  It is not wholly feminine, in fact, I think for Vermeer's character insight may be lost in women.  I would recommend the book on the basis of its story, enchantment and interest.
B000EGCITG|4.0|An okay CD, but not what I love about Pink.  This slightly campy, half-hearted attempt to poke fun at the typical Hollyweird girl, I just wasn't that impressed with this CD.  Perhaps it was because I had too high expectations. When you come out with an incredible CD (Missundaztood), it's hard to follow up.  This reminded me of an attempt to write a sequel to a blockbuster movie, using the same formula and writing style to come up with another catchy phrase.<br /><br />Rather like Arnold in Terminator II when he said, \\"I'll Be Back.\\" And it caught on, then in every movie he attempted to make another line as catchy and it just seemed silly. Pinks vocals are good and if this had come before Missunazstood, it might have seemed fresh, but it wasn't for me.  y were taking a scenic route, which if you listen to the words of this album they did. - To a better day in every way.

0385336691|5.0|I have a dirty little secret: Every time a new Lee Child book comes out, I secretly hope it will be lousy. Most series that have lasted for ten or more books have a few clunkers in them. When I read those clunkers, I think to myself, \\"A-ha! I knew they were only human!\\" and spend a good week or two feeling smug and superior.<br /><br />But so far, the only feeling the Reacher books have stirred in my cold heart is envy.<br /><br />THE HARD WAY is no exception.<br /><br />Once again, Child drops his loner hero into the middle of a very bad situation, and once again Reacher uses a combination of wits and violence to unravel an ever-twisting plot.<br /><br />THE HARD WAY contains more than its fair share of action, suspense, surprises, and sex. It also contains some damn fine writing. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough, and hated for it to end.<br /><br />If you're a reader, you'll love it.<br /><br />If you're a writer, it won't make you feel good about your own work. Not even a tiny bit.
B000FSME1A|3.0|At $19.99 , this is a great bargain for a great film with a lot of nice extras but calling this edition which includes both the original theatrical cut and the inferior \\"Redux\\" is a complete misnomer. Most notable is that it does not include the great \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" documentary, argueably one of the greatest making of docs ever made! It also does not seem to port over extras from the previous edition such as the \\"Destruction of the Kurtz Compound\\" featuring commentary from Coppola. Mr. Coppola what are you thinking !??! I'm sure fans wouldn't mind dishing out a few more extra bucks for a true definitive \\"Complete Dossier\\". Looks like I can't get rid of my old edition yet. Please Mr. Coppola and Paramount, do it right !!!

Then 250 pages with just no action, the main character learns italian and the narrator gives details about the history and geography of northern italy. Then the last 40 pages, the main character defeating only the CIA, the FBI, the Mossad and the best chinese killer alltogether. <br /> <br />Grisham should change of ghostwriter, the current one is exhausted. Save money, don't buy this book.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|First off, I'm not Sheryl Oda, I'm her 14 year old son. =P <br /> <br />Maybe you got the wrong idea from the title. It's not as tiresome as people say, even though 2 hours of music by the same artist can get a little, shall we say, irksome. As a fan of the Peppers for over three years, I've had time to get to know them as a band, their style, and their vision. Three years may seem short compared to people who have been listennin' to them for 20 years, but trust me, I know the Chili Peppers. <br />Anyway, this record works as an ALBUM. It is strong as a complete piece, although it lacks an amonunt of stong tracks. I mean, there are songs like Dani California, Snow (Hey Oh), Stadium Arcadium, Hump de Bump, Torture Me, She's Only 18, Hey, and Readymade, but the other songs maybe get a bit repetitive and monotonous. <br />Lemme put it this way: the songs I didn't mention that are up tempo-could be formed into one song, and the songs I didn't mention that are slow could be molded into another song. <br />Maybe the Peppers tried to hard. I'm trying not to be too cynical, cos I love RHCP. I guess what I mean is, if Mars and Jupiter had been released seperately with not all the strong songs on Jupiter, they would have been two successful records. <br />Argh, forget it, it's hard to explain, and I'm lazy. <br /> <br />1. Dani California: 5/5 First single. I heard it and loved it. Very catchy, but I wanted more songs like this on the record. <br />2. Snow (Hey Oh): 4/5 Needed a couple of listens to appreciate. But now this mellow but powerful tune is in my head all the time. Very sweet. <br />3. Charlie: 3/5 I like the chorus, I guess. Interesting song. <br />4. Stadium Arcadium: 5/5 This song is underappreciated. I love the guitar and drums on this track. (Fun to play on guitar... simple, but fun) <br />5. Hump de Bump: 4/5 Gives us more insight into the percussion than before. As a drummer, this was a fun track to listen to. <br />6. She's Only 18: 4/5 It's cool, I guess.Dunno why. <br />7. Slow Cheetah: 3.5/5 Cool lyrics. I like the verses and the chorus in a different way. <br />8.  Torture Me: 5/5 Fun! Fast! Frusciante! Flea! Nice bass. <br />9. Strip My Mind: 3.5/5 Interesting, chorus is rather catchy. <br />10. Especially In Michigan: 4/5 Cool guitar riffs, but they get tiring. <br />11. Warlocks: 3.5/5 Kind of different from the rest of the album, but enjoyable.  <br />12. C'mon Girl: 4/5 Chorus rocks! <br />13. Wet Sand: 3/5 It's okay, maybe a bit too long. <br />14. Hey: 5/5 Jazzy and a new sound for the Peppers! <br />15. Desecration Smile: 3/5 I'm not too sure about this one... <br />16. Tell Me Baby: 4/5 Catchy tune. Interesting lyrics. Nice blend. <br />17. Hard to Concentrate: 4/5 Try to imagine a mix of Throw Away Your Television and Tear. Soft as Tear, but reminds me of Throw for some reason. <br />18. 21st Century: 4/5 Love the chorus. Nice horns. <br />19. She Looks to Me: 3/5 It's okay. You can at least hear Flea better on this track. <br />20. Readymade: 4/5 Funkeh <br />21. If: 3/5 A nive intermission <br />22. Make You Feel Better: 4/5 Head banger, no wait... Head nodder. But fun <br />23. Animal Bar: 3/5 HMMMmmMMMMmm... Interesting. <br />24. So Much I: 3.5/5 I like the chorus <br />25. Storm In a Teacup: 4/5 I like it cos it's funny. Verses are better than the chorus. <br />26. We Believe: 3.5/5 Did they really need the kid's choir on this track? <br />27. Turn It Again: 4/5 Whoo! Go Frusciante. <br />28. Death of a Martian: 3.5/5 I haven't listenned to this song enough. Interesting way to end an album <br /> <br />You might disagree with me, but so what. BUY THIS ALBUM <br />OVERALL, IT IS WORTH IT
0393327655|2.0|I can't really review the whole book as I couldn't get beyond the first few pages before I had to put this book down, since its assumptions and initial arguments seemed fundamentally flawed.  But for the bits I read here goes.  <br /> <br />The book starts with the example of a young Muslim man blowing himself up on a bus in Israel and killing many others.  This is used to illustrate the madness of religion which Sam Harris seems to blame for many if not most or all of the world's ills.  He then twists uncomfortably as he tries to argue that the Tamil Tigers, who have killed hundreds of civilians in bomb attacks in Sri Lanka are motivated signifcantly by religion following, or being significantly influenced by Hinduism.  To me it would seem more consistent and truthful to say that these 'terrorist acts' are committed in pursuit of political goals. [notably, with reference to his probably largely American audience, he does not mention American bombings in Vietnam and napalming of civilians, or various other acts of terror committed by US administrations - these quoted American military acts being committed for imperialist, economic or other reasons - but surely not for religious reasons]  .  In my view there are clearly many reasons and influencing factors which result in people committing these types of violent acts, including perhaps deeper psychological factors which can find expression through religion but which are not religion itself.    <br /> <br />While I am a committed humanist, I cannot accept, as Sam Harris appears to claim,  that organised religion is responsible for all or most of the bad things happening in the world.   <br /> <br />Sam Harris's attempts to then attack religious moderates, with all the decency and courage these people bring to life, whatever their personal beliefs with respect to their God or Gods, is another error as far as I am concerned.   People who do good, encourage tolerance, love and understanding are to be lauded. I do not accept their beliefs but I would feel that in the scheme of things they are doing a whole lot more good than those who preach intolerance and hatred. <br /> <br />With such a bad beginning to this book I could go no further.  People who feel hatred for religion, who have been oppressed by religion and those who are looking for their views to be confirmed may enjoy this book.  But, as I've found with a number of other books of this type, focused analysis leads to identification of threadbare arguments and poorly supported hypotheses.  However although this book may lack scholarship, it does, through its subject matter, highlight real dangers from religious fundamentalists.  The established church was responsible for the massacres of the crusades, the inquisition, burning of witches, and much much more, holding back the advancement of science, reason and the search for knowledge  The most horrendous, barbarous  practices are carried out in countries following Islamic Sharia law. I have no time for such insitutions and practices.  But the idea that organised religion is responsible for all or even most of the bad events in the world seems far from the truth and if there was an argument that religion is so responsible, this book in my view, doesn't present it.  <br />    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005KFUM|5.0|Before I begin this review, I felt it necessary to say that this here is my all time favorite band, and favorite album. I know I don't have the greatest taste in music compared to some, but if I were to reccommend ANY album to anyone, this would be my first suggestion. <br /> <br />I retrieved this CD for Christmas from my boyfriend, who doesn't like this band too much.. but he's one of those \\"if it's not screaming, I ain't listening to it\\" hoo-has. And I will admit, it takes a while to appreciate such a talented and amazing band. Not many people have taken much interest into this band, especially kids under perhaps the age of 16. Little teens aren't too into the techno-rock sounds of this band. Take my little brother for instance, he hates this band. <br /> <br />But if you're big into different music that will leave you wanting more, this is the band for you. Their album 'Absolution' is just as good! Two thumbs up!
0446677450|5.0|Reading the brief description of this book before I purchased it obviously intrigued me enough to buy it.  Once I got it, I couldn't put it down.  Unlike a Finance Class textbook or other financial resources, this book talks in a somewhat story-like manner to the reader, which helps put the ideas into human perspective.  It's awful that Americans have no formal FINANCE education in high school.  This would have certainly been more helpful (even as a random reading assignment in English, or Home Ec.!!) before college and all of those free t-shirts with credit card applications.  You know, the rewards for getting your credit score off to a flying leap.  Anyone who feels like they've missed the boat and is trying to get back on before they hit retirement might find a real appreciation for this book.  I've also passed it on to a friend, who has thanked me twice for leading her to a few quick ideas that have already changed her financial landscape for the better.

B00005QG9J|5.0|This was the first Incubus CD I listened to.  While I don't know if that influenced me, this is my favorite Incubus CD.  The playing is succinct and Boyd's singing is great. The band sounds really tight. These kids really know their instruments. Listen to some of the tracks and see if you don't agree.  This is one of my favorite rock CD's. BTW, I was driving the PCH (Pacific Coast Highway) in Malibu the other day and passed the street - you guessed it - Morning View Drive.  Wonder if that is the inspiration for the title.
0060977493|3.0|While I greatly appreciate Arundhati's skillful rendition of setting and her characterization, I regret having bought or read this book.  It matters not how many rave about a so-called \\"masterpiece\\", or what prizes have been awarded, the inappropriate publicizing of private sexual activity is vulgar and sickening. As much as the intrusion would raise objections in our own lives,  so the explicit, painful efforts to make sex public in this novel is a misplaced attempt at being liberated.    I am an Advanced Placement Literature teacher.  I have been looking for a classic from another culture. It is definitely that, but not recommended as reading for anyone, young or old.
0440419514|4.0|...I mean it. But fairly loosely. I mean, it's not perfect, but it's not bad.   <br /> <br />The storyline was pretty good. All but the first book. The first book was lame. I mean, I get the whole \\"save your friend or die trying\\" theory. But where's the whole \\"larger picture\\" thing? What do they call it? Destiny? He keeps mentioning it, but doesn't do much about it. Like he's trying to \\"build up suspense.\\" Dude, get on with it! <br /> <br />The other books, however, were a lot better. You could actually  <br />imagine a larger picture. It was no longer this whole one-scene thing. You could actually see that it wasn't just the problems of one or two people anymore. Suddenly, loads more was at stake. I have to admit that, after reading the first book, I might not have continued if I didn't have a close friend who was crazy about it. But I've got to admit, the last two were really good. Particularly the last one. What's it called? The Amber Spyglass. Yeah, some Christians might be a little touchy about it, but I'm Christian, and I like it. People, it's a story. If you're hell-bent on hating it because of that, then get a life. <br /> <br />Besides Will, all the other characters were a little . . .  weird? Their characters were a little . . . um . . . not my type. But Will was awesome. <br /> <br />Would I recommend it? Probably. But if you're more into the whole action-not-fantasy sceme, you'll probably be disappointed. Still, it's worth a try. <br />
B000EGF0NW|5.0|Lucky was a blunt memoir of the author's experience with rape. Alice Sebold writes very personally, as if she is verbally telling the story. The book opened my eyes to the effects of rape and the ways it can completely change a person's life and way of thinking. Not only is the book thought-provoking, it is a page-turner as well. I guarantee you will want to keep reading through the very end. Both terrible yet inspiring, I highly suggest reading Sebold's story.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool have finally done it, they've created an album so epic it is in a category all itself. This is their greatest achievement and that is saying a lot for a band who has released Opiate, Undertow, Aenima, and Lateralus. But this tops them at all, it synthesizes the best elements from those albums and creates a sound all its own. Allow yourself to immerse in this album, it is truly a project that requires the full attention and devotion of those who are listening...
B00000AOUD|5.0|Is this album really a joke?  The music has tremendous rhythm, grace, depth, and the lyrics develop a single idea and make perfect sense to anyone who's seen metaphors before.  Sometimes they hardly count as metaphors: <br /> <br />\\"The poet and the wise man stand <br />behind the gun, behind the gun.\\" <br /> <br />The lyrics in no way pretend to be from the point of view of an eight-year-old, although youth is one of the themes. <br /> <br />Likewise the development of the music is interesting and exciting, sad, sometimes puzzling or challenging, but not confusing.  This piece really satisfies my appetite for structure: themes, contrasts, transitions, reprises, development.  There's a section where the music breaks down and makes some false starts before regaining its feet, but all in service of the story. <br /> <br />Of course the album cover is bizarre and funny, but it can be seen as complementing the story: parodying a world too self-stupified to receive something different. <br /> <br />I think the crazy cover and the \\"joke\\" description of the album are something between a counterbalance and self-consciousness after having produced something heavy and serious, beautiful and sad.  \\"Hey, we were only joking.\\"  Or maybe they really were fleeing from Significance (the song makes a case for that) but reached it anyway. <br /> <br />The live excerpt is so-so, the interview is interesting background on how the album came about. <br /> <br />There is a sound at the very end of part one, a low electronic \\"blurp-blurp\\" that I swear is the sound of the scary machine in the Avengers episode, \\"The House that Jack Built.\\"
B0002X314C|5.0|I have never owned a CD that was perfect listening throughout the entire CD until now. John Legend covers everything you need in an album. From music to be mad to, to be happy to, to be sad to. Perfect for kicking back and enjoying good music. Don't press the skip button with this one, you'll miss something great.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|I keep my reviews short and to the point so in my opinion, I really enjoyed this movie and there was great action & adventure along with alot of comedy.  I recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of movies. <br /> <br />
B000E33VWW|4.0|This was a very smartly made movie.  To understand Capote you must understand the man, and as you watch this movie you really understand the many layers of Truman Capote.  An egotist, that struggles with constant hints at homosexuality, as well as an insane genius.<br /><br />The basic plot of of the movie is that after great success from his novel \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" he is onto his next great venture.  In 1959 a family was brutally murdered by close range shotgun in a very bloody massacre.  Truman Capote interviews and empathizes one of the murders to see the man under the crime.  In doing so, he creates one of the greatest non-fiction novels to date, \\"In Cold Blood.\\"  This movie uses great characterization and you really begin to understand what motivates each character in the story.<br /><br />This movie also used a lot of research, even little things like clearing up the rumor that Harper Lee wasn't the true author of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" which wasn't even proven false until after the movie was on DVD, and many of his letters and conversations.  I found this movie very enjoyable, and Hoffman's best acted film to date.  It's much different than a lot of other roles he's done.<br /><br />For those who saw many of the other Oscar nominated movies like Munich, Crash, and Brokeback Mountain, I feel it is time for you to also give this movie a shot.  You won't be disappointed.  Even the special features and commentary on the extras are great.<br /><br />Great transfer, great surround sound, and easily navigable menus make this a really enjoyable DVD, as well as a really enjoyable home theatre experience.  This is definately worth purchasing, or at least seeing.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have surprised me with every record they have put out. They are by far, impo, the coolest rock band to have ever lived. When I heard about this album, I was so anticipated that it would bring back their earlier days with their crazy funk style. It not only has done that, but it has some of the most original and different Chilis style I have ever heard. Songs like \\"So Much I\\" and \\"Make You Feel Better\\" sound like nothing the band has ever done. Also, I think both CD's, Mars and Jupiter, are probably equally as good. I couldn't decide which one was better. Highlights on Jupiter I think include: \\"Especially in Michigan,\\" \\"Hey,\\" \\"Charlie,\\" and \\"Hump de Bump.\\" Hump de Bump is crazily funky and will make you want to get up and dance your ass off. Highlights on Mars would have to be \\"Hard to Concentrate,\\" \\"21st Century,\\" \\"Storm in a Teacup\\" and \\"So Much I.\\" Storm in a Teacup is some hardcore stuff and probably the heaviest Chilis song I think I have ever heard. What an amazingly talented band. Just listen to the solos at the end of Turn it Again and tell me they are not amazing. Rock on.
B000EULJLU|5.0|i am addicted to this album, its awesome! recommended to all who appreciate great music!!
B0000640VO|5.0|I'd give it more stars if possible. It just makes you love life, and it does it in the simplest way. The opening can almost be seen as a little Wes Anderson-ish, only GOOD. It takes on a life of its own, and it can only be viewed in french. As with most subtittle films, you eventually don't even notice, but the beauty of the language just adds subconscienciously to the wonder and charm of this. I cant say enough about it. It has its own world, yet is terribly familiar, and is the CLOSEST any film I have seen has ever come to showing how people think, what they like and why, and the tricks our minds can play. You leave thinking you were sitting in that cafe just watching a true, heartwarming tale that is just too good to be false. The music, cinematography, story, everything just makes you love life and fall in love. All together, there is about 20 seconds of actual sexually explicit material, but the overall good of the film gets it by and is more than forgivable to the faint of heart. Sit back and enjoy.
B0000024K1|5.0|Is what you'll do after you've listened to this. Then you'll put the CD into the hole and cover it up with the dirt you've just exhumed. Just kidding, of course, this CD is too mind-blowing to describe in words.<br /><br />What I'll do is put this on while I watch Will & Grace reruns, then I'll just dance and dance until I feel like Chuck D. is there with me and we twirl around together like silly high schoolers and all the worries of the world drift away.<br /><br />Then night falls and we share a bottle of chianti and some oysters. I'll show him my collection of potato chips that look like celebrities and he'll freak out when I show him the pringle that looks liek Elvis. He'll say, \\"Elvis was a hero to most, but to you he's a salty snack treat.\\"<br /><br />To which I'll retort, \\"Word.\\"
B000EGCITG|5.0|Watching the decline of pop music over the last few decades has seriously sucked for someone like me who lived for music. I worked the music stores back in the day when it was fun and not in a mall. I went to endless concerts and then scored myself a long term gig with a great musician. As you can see I like music. I have all kinds - from world - electronica - classical- pretty much any kind of music has something to offer to me. But pop music was beginning to rot...literally. Pop - at it's best - should be catchy and well made music that also has a little something to contribute socially. Among a small handfull of others who are bringing pop back from the dead (Beck, Ben Folds, Imogene Heap, Gnarles Barkley:Danger Mouse and CeeLo to name a few) I'd like to thank Pink for actually pulling that off with this record. I listen to it repeatedly...and that's hard for me to do anymore. Please keep it up!
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Just heard the track \\"Woman\\" in Dubai... Scorching! It's good to hear MUSIC again. Anyone who is searching for rock done right. Look no further.. Wolfmother.
B00003ETOW|3.0|The reason for the atrocious quality of the DVDs and tapes is probably that they were made off old film prints from TV stations and the European theatrical release, with all their splices, dirt, color shifts, sound drop-outs, etc.  Not to mention old transfers to video from God knows when.  Maybe it's no longer copyright protected and in the public domain, so anyone with an old print can knock off some cheap copies and sell them at dollar stores and the like.<br /><br />Someone on an IMDB post says that the original material (e.g. the original negative, sound elements, copies used to make release prints and so on) was destroyed. If this is true, there is no way to get a re-mastered version as all you can do is try to find the best of these crappy broken-down prints and old video transfers.  Storing original negatives properly at a lab or other archival facility is expensive and it seems many producers just threw stuff away not thinking it would be worth anything in the future.  This is too bad as it sounds like it's a rather decent production that had some nice cinematography and good performances.
B000EGCZQC|5.0|This mini-lp sleeve version of this brilliant classic rock masterpiece is a real treat for fans.  It comes in a wonderfully designed gatefold sleeve which includes a sticker of an abstract from an old Time Magazine review of the album, all the lyrics in both English and Japanese and a poster of the band albeit in black and white.  The packaging so faithfully reproduces the original vinyl sleeve even down to the inner sleeve.<br /><br />The sound quality is an improvement over the previous remastered version however for the two big tracks, \\"Black Magic Woman\\" and \\"Oye Como Va\\" for some reason the bass overpowers everything else and even sounds muddy.  The rest of the tracks, including the bonus live ones, sound much better but it's a shame that for my 2 favourite hits, the sound engineer had to screw up the sound levels.<br /><br />And now to the quality of the songs: Carlos Santana who once played with Miles Davis is very obviously heavily influenced by him, Tito Puente and Gabor Szabo (Gypsy Queen) and this is very evident on this album. Peter Green from the original Fleetwood Mac and the composer of \\"Black Magic Woman\\" was also involved in the making of this cover version of his song which is arguably even better than the original which may not be the case for the other cover \\"Oye Como Va\\" wherein Tito Puente's version with lots more percussion probably is better and yet both tracks are every upcoming guitarist's dream jam songs.<br /><br />Speaking as a guitarist myself I can tell you that there are few joys that surpass that of jamming to \\"Oye Como Va\\" with a band and \\"Black Magic Woman\\" is one of the first songs that I learnt to play note-for-note when I first started playing years ago. Although most people remember the album for these 2 tracks, the rest of the tracks are also very good and \\"Samba Pa Ti\\" is just a brilliant piece of mood music and great tone and phrasing on the part of Carlos on guitar.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00005QEO1|4.0|buy the album if you enjoy good music and someone teach that moron that loves Guns N Roses how to spell the word instead...oh, I guess I just taught him...anyway, buying this album is a no brainer....just get it...thank you
B000EGCITG|2.0|I really wanted to write a scathing review, but I'm going to refrain because I looove Pink and I think she is totally rad, but this album is not up to snuff. I don't know if her label threatened to drop her if she didn't churn out a few hits or what, but the album is lyrically trite and melodically hackneyed-- the bad kind of pop. To me, her fist 2 albums were the good kind. Even the third had redeeming songs. (Duet w/ Peaches? Awesome.) She gets 2 stars instead of 1 for the duet w/ the Indigo Girls. <br /> <br />And that is my nice review.
B00005MP58|5.0|After being hounded for many years by my friend to watch this movie , I gave in. One day on a whim I bought the film and have been hooked ever since! I have watched this movie so many times that I'm surprised the dvd hasn't worn out!<br /><br />  As a viewer I always know what each character is feeling without them having to say a word thanks to the superb acting. There are no gaps in the story and is all flows together nicely. A truly beautiful love story. I've never read any of Jane Austen's books but I love the movie adaptations of them. The color quality is poor at times but I'm so engrossed in the story that I only noticed the first time I watched it. I Love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!! A must own for any lover of romantic movies and romantic period pieces.
B00005JOVN|4.0|While this is a remake, I'm reviewing it as a stand alone film.  While the original was certainly a great movie, why should its existence reduce the enjoyment you can get from this film?  I would recommend viewers judge this film on its own merits, as most comparisons to the original will only limit your own enjoyment. <br /> <br />This is an exciting movie with some great special effects.  I know that many people have knocked the character development and the uninspired dialogue, but I think that they miss the point of the film.  When you watch this film, I would encourage you not to build up any false expectations.  Instead, realize that the show you are about to view was made with great special effects and will feature numerous escapes \\"just in the knick of time\\" (Even if most are out of the realm of realism).  This is not an academy award nominee for best picture, but that doens't mean that it isn't a lot of fun to watch. <br /> <br />While the characters aren't developed very fully, most have a lot of charisma.  Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, and Richard Dreyfus really stand out, but the rest do well, too.  The nature of the film, in which we're never sure who's going to live or die, makes the many close excapes exiting.  In fact, several of the stars die in the process, so you never really know who is going to make it.  Thus, even though we all know that some will escape, we never know until the end which ones that will be. <br /> <br />I also appreciate the fact that the film is only 1 1/2 hours long.  For an action film like this, that's about the limit before the viewer tires of all the effects and close calls.   <br /> <br />All in all, this film is one that most people can enjoy without having to think too hard.  While there is no sex in the film, the scenes of people dying are often disturbing, so the film is not for the very young.  Otherwise, I would recommend this to most people.
0786915749|4.0|I very much liked this book. It always keeps me thinking and unlike most books, I didn't know what was going to happen next. It kept me surprised and on the ball because of all the new things that keep happing. I never wanted to stop reading it, but I have a busy life so I had to do many other things or I would have tried to read in all in like a few days. <br /> <br />Weis Margaret did a wonderful job making many things of them to encounter on there way of there original journey. One of the only things I didn't like was that I lost track of some of the characters it seemed like they just left and you didn't know what was happing to them or anything at all. Other then that, she did a great job. <br /> <br />I would definitely refer this book to any one who likes fantasy. It is at a good reading level for most people to read it I missed some things because I had a limited time to read it and I was so busy. But any young adult I think would really like it. For it is challenging to remember what all that is happening, but still easy enough for most any one to read.  <br />
B0000DBJDM|5.0|One of the strangest \\"Live Music\\" DVD's I've ever seen, Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii features a Pre-Dark Side of the Moon Pink Floyd rocking out in the ruins of Pompeii, Italy and giving their interviews. In the ruins of Pompeii there is no audience; Only the band, their instruments, amps, and a camera crew. I'm giving it 5 stars, but a complaint I have is the cinematography. There's times when, instead of focusing on the band, the camera will begin filming other stuff. I want to see the band...Anyway, another cool thing about the show is that the performance stuff isn't even the best part. I particularly enjoyed the interviews, especially with the obviously high David Gilmour. <br />There's one part in an interview where Gilmour states \\"A lot of people think we're a drug oriented band...But we're not, you can trust us.\\" This wouldn't be funny if he wasn't so obviously baked. While the setlist they perform, which is: <br /> <br />1. Echoes Pt.1 <br />2. Careful With That Axe Eugene <br />3. A Saucerful of Secrets <br />4. One of These Days <br />5. Mademoiselle Nobs <br />6. Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun <br />7. Echoes Pt.2 <br /> <br />may not be the best setlist, as I said...It was done while they were recording their masterpiece. One thing I realized while watching this DVD though was how good of a drummer Nick Mason is. The guy is almost as good as John Bonham or Neil Peart.  All the guys are obviously good performers and it's cool to see them jamming. This is probably my 2nd favorite Live DVD (right behind Led Zeppelin's \\"The Song Remains the Same\\") check it out. <br />GRADE: A- <br />
1400062071|5.0|Elizabeth Strout's latest, \\"Abide With Me\\" is a wonderfully rich and satisfying novel. I agree with all the other 5-star reviews. I also wanted to point out how well Strout incorporates the Cold War era into her small town sensibilities. Little things, such as the way Tyler begins his sentences with \\"Say...\\" and how characters use \\"Godfree\\" rather than \\"God\\" to punctuate their outbursts, and that several families have invested in bomb shelters, all add so much to the overall authenticity and \\"feel\\" of the novel in time and place that you can really be transported to this provincial town in the late 1950s.<br /><br />In addition, the foggy specter of possible incest in Tyler's late wife's life is skimmed over in just the way it would have been in the 1950s.  Strout is wonderfully subtle! I'll look forward to her next novel - may it come soon!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I've never really liked the Red Hot Chili Peppers...I liked \\"Bloodsugarsexmagik\\" and I like the song \\"Californication\\" but that's about it. This double album is not only probably their best album, but it's also one of the best double albums I've ever listened too. Double albums always seemed to me to be a way for the artist to funnel all the crap they've written and a couple good songs just to get it out of the way. Here, RHCP has crafted an album with every track being good. This isn't an album you can just turn on and listen to one or two tracks...Every song you'll want to listen to again. The band is in top form, Anthony Kiedis's vocals are as good as they've ever been. Flea further proves he's one of the best bassists around right now. John Frusciante goes nuts on the guitar solos and Chad Smith fills out the rhythm section nicely. The following is a list of the tracks and a few (extremely undetailed) comments: <br /> <br />JUPITER (DISC 1) <br />1. Dani California-5/5-This song is awesome, the chorus is great.  <br />2. Snow (Hey Oh)-5/5-Very funky song, but just as good as the first song. <br />3. Charlie-5/5-Very cool rhyming techniques in this song. Another really good song. <br />4. Stadium Arcadium-5/5-A little mellower than the last few songs, but good. <br />5. Hump de Bump-5/5-One of the best Chili Peppers songs. It's so great and so catchy, you can't not like it. <br />6. She's Only 18-5/5-An awesome guitar solo. <br />7. Slow Cheetah-5/5-It's slower, but it's catchy...So, it works. <br />8. Torture Me-5/5-This song is good, the guitar solo by John Frusciante is totally awesome. He goes off. <br />9. Strip My Mind-5/5-Lyrics are good, the song is one of the weaker tracks though. <br />10. Especially in Michigan-5/5-This songs pretty cool, but it's too simalar to \\"Strip My Mind\\" <br />11. Warlocks-5/5-Great basslines and guitars. <br />12. C'mon Girl-5/5-My favorite song on the album, up to this point. <br />13. Wet Sand-5/5-Smart lyricism. <br />14. Hey-5/5-It's mellow, but really cool and catchy. <br /> <br />MARS (DISC 2) <br />1. Desecreation Smile-5/5-Great song, one of the best on either discs. <br />2. Tell Me Baby-5/5-Really catchy and the basslines are terrific. <br />3. Hard to Concentrate-5/5-A little mellower, but it's good. <br />4. 21st Century-5/5-Awesome. Lyrics are kinda trippy, but that's not a bad thing. <br />5. She Looks to Me-5/5-One of the weaker tracks, but again...It's still a 5-star song. <br />6. Readymade-5/5-Great guitar solo, the song is catchy. Pure RHCP. <br />7. If-4/5-The weakest track on the album...RHCP should stick to the funky-kind of music they've been doing the entire album. <br />8. Make You Feel Better-5/5-The lyrics are great. Lots of sexual innuendo. <br />9. Animal Bar-5/5-Another great song. <br />10. So Much I-5/5-(No Comment) <br />11. Storm in a Teacup-5/5-One of my favorite songs on the CD. <br />12. We Believe-5/5-Good. <br />13. Turn it Again-5/5-This is one of those songs that really picks up when it gets to the chorus. The guitar solo is the best one on here. <br />14. Death of a Martian-5/5-Great song to end the album....Perfect. <br /> <br />There you have it. Fans should be impressed. <br />GRADE: A+ <br />
B000002H4C|4.0|I am a big fan of this sound track.  The sound quality is good, the tunes are good, the variety is good, and it holds up well to repeated listenings... the only down side is that some of the best music from the movie is not featured and some of the  songs on the CD werent in the movie or were only played in the closing credits!  Most notably missing are Devo's excellent We're Through Being Cool, and Black Sabbath's EV1050 as well as the original classical score by Bernstein.   It should also be noted that some of Blue Oyster Cult's songs were cut from both the soundtrack and the movie but can be found on their Fire of Unknown Origin album.
6305657947|5.0|\\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" is a remake of an older film I've never seen and stars the former James Bond, Pierce Brosnan as the title character. This is the perfect role for Brosnan, because he's better suited as a smart and sophisticated millionaire than an action hero. The movie is smart, plausible, entertaining, and the performances are very suave. As I said, Brosnan plays Thomas Crown; a millionaire who's life really isn't very fun...So, Crown decides to steal a painting from a museum that's worth 100 Million dollars. <br />Crown, however, is not stealing the painting for what it's worth but merely for the excitement of doing it. The actual theft of the painting is really entertaining and pretty damned plausible. After he steals the painting, the cops begin investigating as well as an insurance investigator named Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), who's willing to do anything to find this painting. One thing Crown longs for (as it's explained in his therapy sessions) is a female equal to himself and Catherine has enough determination and smarts to fill that. Well, eventually Crown and Catherine begin an affair (and I must say, that for a woman in her forties Russo looks incredible) that appears to be only about sex. Neither one of them are entirely sure if they can trust one another. Comedian Denis Leary ('Rescue Me' & 'Jesus' Son') plays Michael, a detective working on the case along with Catherine. But, Brosnan and Russo really light up the screen. They play the characters better than anybody I could think of and they actually have charisma on screen, which makes it all the more better. This movie isn't a masterpiece but it is entertaining and exciting and worth watching. <br /> <br />GRADE: A- <br />
0066214122|4.0|I found the book enjoyable to read in just one sitting. The story moves pretty fast. The background information on nanotechnology is very well presented and easy to understand.  <br /> <br />However, i found certain elements of the story really far-fetched. Don't worry, i won't include spoilers.  <br /> <br />I just can't imagine that there are only a handful of programmers in charge of the fab production. This fab seems to have sprung out of nowhere with little evidence of a ramp-up in technology. It's like they've managed to produce high speed laptops while the rest of the industry is still struggling to get a working abacus. <br /> <br />Not to mention they don't wear bunny suits in their cleanroom. If they're situated in the desert you'd think at least they'd wear protective boots so they don't get sand all over the floor. I can't imagine the air shower getting all that off.
0385504209|2.0|The son of a prep school math teacher and a church organist, Dan Brown has publically confessed an uncomfortableness with absolute faith.  During a recent speech, he said, \\"I was not born with the luxury of absolute certainty or absolute faith. I have a lot of questions. I've written a novel in which fictional characters ask some of those questions and offer possible answers.\\" So is the DaVinci Code really a work of fiction or a book about Dan Brown's quest for answers?  I guess it's up to the reader to decide.<br /><br />Frankly, I've grown weary of techo-thrilling, conspiracy busting, orthodoxy deconstructing novels.  Give me the well-told story over the controversial theory anyday.  The DaVinci Code made me want to reread all those wonderful Alistair Maclean novels (Ice Station Zebra, Guns of Naverone, etc.).  Bring back the Master Storyteller!
B0000W3P00|3.0|I was hoping the sound quality would be better but it's simply a reissue, NOT a remaster.<br /><br />If you have the original, save your money.<br /><br />It does come with the lyrics though, which is something the original CD didn't have.
B0001HLVS2|2.0|This movie got out of the gate rather quickly which I was very happy about.  It's important for a film to grab the viewer or at least set a few things up to spark interest.  The first 20 minutes did just that.  BUT.... <br /> <br />... the next 1 hour plus just dragged and dragged with nothing happening of any importance and this is where the movie spun its wheels really badly.  It wasnt sure what to do with itself and just plodded along with some meaningless side-stories and situations.  I started yawning at one point just hoping that the early excitement came out again.  It barely did.  One interesting but too short battle sequence late and then it just fizzled off and was over.   <br /> <br />Russell Crow's character was pretty cool but I wasn't rooting for the guy or anything.  Most of the other shipmen were throw aways.... noone stood out or made anything of themselves.  Too bad. <br /> <br />The battle scenes and camera work were solid and the sound of the cannons was awesome.  But, there was not enough action and too much dilly-dallyin' around.  Ultimately, this movie is boring and will help you sleep if you're having trouble.  The good reviews here at Amazon must be coming from large boat owners/hobbyists or ex-navy members because the general public will be squirming in their seat waiting for it to be over. <br /> <br />The movie is 2 hours and 18 minutes long and about a half hour of it actually has anything happening.  The rest is blah. <br /> <br />NOT recommended!
1400079276|5.0|This is not an easy read. All of its 600 odd pages are littered with subtle undercurrents making it dense, complex and surreal at times. Often sad and wistful with copious amounts of philosophy, art and music thrown in, Kafka on the shore is never boring. True, parts of it are slower and some parts whizz by. Sometimes you'll feel frustrated at not getting what the author intends to tell you immediately. This book requires some patience. Its not fast food meant to be gobbled up in a quick bite. rather, it is like rare wine meant to be savored. <br /> <br />This is the first Murakami book I have read, so I may be off key in his writing styles and his previous works comparison. I will not reveal the plot, but let you in on the fact that often there isn't one. The author leaves a lot for you to decide in what you want to believe in... 'Everything is a metaphor' he writes and indeed its for you to decide how to decode it. Which is why you'll often find that you can relate to it at different levels. Its a sheer piece of art and you'll either love it or really hate it. <br /> <br />The journey of a 15 year old to clear his warped mind of a curse is intersected with that of 60 year old whose mind is much that of a young adult - unable to read or write. In that sense, the work is allegorical. What one lacks and searches, the other has - opening doorways to age and mind. Alternate chapters detail this journey and their paths cross though they may or may not ever meet physically. Murakami strongly uses the idea of a labrynth and the notion that we are the products of the reality of our minds. <br /> <br />One of the reviewers here remarked that he wasn't sure if Murakami is a Genius or merely someone really clever. I'm not sure myself - for very often you feel that something ordinary must have a hidden meaning in the book. Perhaps that is what the author means to deliver in the book. That our realities and our understandings of everything in this world is a product of who we really are. <br /> <br />A really fine piece of literature that deserves to be amongst the best books written recently.
B000F4RHB6|4.0|I think I speak for many when I say their previous collection \\"Time Flies\\" was a few essential tracks short. To me, Huey Lewis & The News was one of the defining bands of the 1980's. \\"Greatest\\" corrects that by adding those songs and being longer overall. So besides the obvious choices like \\"Heart Of Rock & Roll\\", \\"Do You Believe In Love\\", \\"I Wanna New Drug\\", and \\"The Power Of Love\\", we also get fan favorites like \\"Hip To Be Square\\", \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", \\"Small World\\", and \\"Back In Time\\" (the other great song from Back To The Future). I could still complain about a missing song or two, but at 21 tracks, I'd have to admit this is the \\"Greatest\\".
B000FP2OPY|4.0|Horror and monster shows are certainly not for everyone, but if it is something that you enjoy, this show is among the better examples of the genre.  <br /> <br />It can be genuinely scary at times, and not many shows can make that claim.  These aren't the wisecracking, \\"hip talking\\" monsters of other recent shows . . . they're savage and the result is a high body count in most episodes.  Another problem of similiar shows is when season long plot lines never go anywhere and leave you with as many questions at the end as you had in the beginning.  This series concludes the first story arc at the end of the season with a typical \\"cliffhanger ending\\", but there's not a lack of answers to leave you frustrated. Well done. <br /> <br />It was recently announced that Supernatural will be back on the air again in the Fall on Thursday nights for its second season. I hope it continues to see success for as long as it takes to tell the entire story.  <br /> <br />P.S. - There's a great Wendigo (Bigfoot!) episode early in the season.  This is no \\"caught on film casually strolling in the distance\\" Bigfoot. If you watch nothing else, watch that episode.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This album kicks the doors down and clears the space of all the predictable [...] that has come out lately.  I was so caught off guard by this record and it will be copied by everyone over the next two years.  Cee-Lo's voice has always been amazing, but this is unreal.  Lyrically \\"Just A Though\\" is the best track on the album and musicially as well.  I can't get enough of this and it restored my faith in popular music-I hope I don't get tired of hearing this on the radio.
0140288503|5.0|Black Hawk Down                    Penguin Group, 2000, 392 pp.  <br />Mark Bowden                                                                                            ISBN 0140288503 <br /> <br /> In the dry and arid desert climate in Mogadishu, U.S. troops try to take down some high-ranking terrorist officials.  Their once simple mission turns into chaos as one of their Black Hawk helicopters is shot out of the sky.  This leads to an epic rescue mission, in which many lives are sacrificed.  The intensity picks up as the town's people start to overtake the small amount of troops, and backups are late in arrival.   <br /> This book was really fun to read because of it authenticity.  It is very dramatic and intense, and to think that it really happened is hard to believe.  This is a great classic book that I recommend to anyone who likes action and fun reading. <br /> <br />  <br />
B0009X766Y|5.0|Let's clear up this aspect ratio issue once and for all.  THE STING was shot in 1.37:1 for intended matting to 1.85:1 for theatrical exhibition.<br /><br />Many films are shot this way.<br /><br />When you watch a film shot through this process on television or full screen DVD, the matte is removed and you see more of the original negative image on the top and the bottom.  This often called \\"open matte\\".<br /><br />The latest release restores the theatrical exhibition ratio of 1.85:1.  In short, it replaces the intended matting.<br /><br />There's nothing \\"bogus\\" about the widescreen on the legacy release.  This is the way the movie was originally shown in theatres.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is a wonderful album!It's difficult today find beautiful album like this.This band reminds me great bands like new order and joy division and all the new wave of the 80's.Buy this album,believe me it's not a waste of money!

B000A2H812|5.0|Being both a Reggae fan and a Punk fan, I loved the Clash, this band is just as good and this cd has been in my car stereo for 2 months solid! My wife is going to kill me if I don't change it soon, a great blend of gypsy(tom waits rain dogs stuff) and great english punk!

B000001DTM|4.0|Although 'Achtung Baby' is without doubt an album of quality, it is not quite U2's finest. This album shows U2 when they were somewhat more raw, edgy and experimental and is a long way from the more cautious and conventional rock that has found its way into their newer offerings. <br /> <br />This album contains a number of top notch classics such as the anthem style 'Who's gonna ride your wild horses' and the fantastic 'Until the end of the world'. The latter containing the immortal line \\"In my dreams I was drowning my sorrows, But my sorrows, they'd learned to swim\\". However the track that stands out above all else on this CD, and indeed above the rest of the band's work, is 'One'. This is lyrically one of the finest songs ever written and is the song for which, above all others, U2 should be remembered. <br /> <br />The only reason this album doesn't receieve 5 stars is because of the unbelieveable quality of some of U2's other albums. For almost any band other than U2 this would represent the pinnacle of their achievements. For U2 however, there have been greater.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I'm a cure fan and I'm so happy that dark music is come back thanks to band like arcade fire and interpol.I like this album very much.I bought it in a period when I was a little depressed and I listened songs like the beautiful nyc,untitled,hands away and leif erikson...this is a great debut of one of the best band of the 00's
B000002UYZ|4.0|What's the worst thing you can say about the Beatles? During the British Invasion, at the height of \\"Beatlemania\\", they're wasn't much. They made the most kick ass tunes, they made girls scream and parents blush. They had hair like no one else, with a heavy accent. If you hadn't heard a Beatle song, you had to be pretty much on an island somewhere.  <br /> <br />The Beatles are one of those bands that recorded great music year after year, until their demise. However, to see them in their early years (1962 - 1966) was something really special. They were young and loving it, and made songs that people in love - or out of it - could relate to. They had been together for so long, and so their early effort really showed them trying to prove themselves in the mainstream. And it worked.  <br /> <br />This album has all of that goodness packed in. It's got \\"Help\\", \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\", \\"All My Loving\\", \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand.\\". I can go on, man, but what's the point. If you need the Beatles at their youngest, you NEED this album.  <br /> <br />The only flaw is the sound quaility. We have people in space, but we can't make \\"Eight Days a Week\\" sound better than a live feed from a radio. Sad thing is, the songs on Disk 1 (which were REAL early for the Beatles) are not graced with good quaility, although any media player will signal a 320 kbps. Which is sad, because the songs just so fine.
B00000294R|5.0|think about it this guy dropped 1 album!!!!!!!!!! the other was after he died, if he dropped a few mo were u think he be??????you would be mentioning him w/ pac, big, nas, jay, damn i feal bad 4 em.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I had LOG's previous album and I enjoyed it but then I just kind of stopped listening to metal for a year or so and it was just sitting there. So fast forward a year or so after Ashes of the wake is released I went ahead and picked it up because I was back to metal with the likes of Slayer, old Metallica, Converge and Unearth.<br /><br />After a couple of listens I realized that this band could quite possibly be the best metal band of the new age. And since they got signed onto Sony, their fan base has grown. And you can now find their albums basically anywhere.<br /><br />The thing I like so much about this band are their signature 'springy' sounding riffs that just get you moving. I haven't found any other band with better riffs.<br /><br />Overall, pick up this album and check out LOG's previous work too. This is probably their best release so far. Everything about this album just screams METAL while other 'metal' bands are using riffs that don't sound metal at all.<br /><br />Don't hold this band above Slayer though. They've basically laid the foundation for all things extreme/thrash/death metal.

B0002858YS|4.0|This is an album that I borrowed off of a friend and I didn't have very high hopes for it.  When I heard it I was pleasently surprised.  When I listen to these guys two bands come to mind, The Cure and Coldplay.  I think this band sounds alot like the cure, from the vocals down to the music.  It is definately pop and it may be just me but they, in a small way, remind be of coldplay.  Maybe it's because they are the only other brit pop band I like, I don't know.  It was a good album, I didn't like all the songs but there were 5 or 6 that I enjoyed listening to which is good enough for four stars.  I don't have it anymore but I plan on getting it soon.  If you like the poppy style music, especialy the brit pop, it's in my opinion some of the best out there!
B000AU9UYM|1.0|Boring, dragged out, thought it would never end!  This movie is terrible!!!!!  NOT fun like the other Batman movies!!!!!
B00005ATQD|1.0|I just happend to tune in to this ludicrous excuse for a movie.  No wonder they're marriage didn't work considering the sick lengths the man went to in a movie which proved to be completely bizarre and beyond any understanding in the normal realm of the universe.  Nicole is much better off with Kieth Urban or not but alone would be better than with crazy Tom.
B00082IJ08|5.0|First off if you really, really, really like feel good inc be prepared for a potential let down, no two songs on the album fit the same mold and many of the songs on the album are much weirder than it (and in my eyes better). Also once you by the album you will realize that the band is less a hip-hop(/a hole lot of other things) group because of the rap, but more because of the sampling and electronic aspects. In listening to the album I can see that the band is really quite smart. They have \\"feel good inc\\", \\"dirty Harry\\", and, \\"dare\\" which are all good songs but are very radio friendly. Then they have songs like \\"kids with guns\\", \\"Oh green world\\", and \\"November has come\\" which are, well, weird. However, I like weird music and it is rare that I like a group that hits the top of the charts. I came to this group due to it's similarities with Mr. Bungle (although small they may be) and through hearing that they had worked with Del the funky homosapian, so keep in mind that I might just like different music than you.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|This does not unfold like a Spielberg movie, as it at times is more artfully rendered and less sensational than most of his work.  Eric Bana is perfectly cast as a deep thinker in the shell of a hulk of sorts.  In the plot line, he is a secret service agent, and former Golda Meir bodyguard, assigned to kill those responsible for the deaths of Israili Olympic athletes.  Oddly similar to his casting as The Hulk, where he must also show both brains and brawn. <br /> <br />I wont go into the real events this is based on, as other review do so.  Instead I point out the movie has depth and subtlety.  In the final scenes Bana's character is in bed with his wife, and clearly traumatized.  He pictures the murder of the athletes which began the quest for revenge that took him from his family.  Does his wife know what images were running through his mind, how?  When the agent's superior refuses dinner with him, somehow this is a supreme dissavowal, but this is not stated.  Golda does not herself ever congratulate or even thank the agent.  Was this reprisal for certain of his actions? <br /> <br />Last, the legend of the Israeli secret service as an unstoppable agent of death, is questioned in the movie, but more so in real life.  Some of their targets appear unrelated to terrorism as the agent himself suspects, and at least one of the masterminds of the Olympic deaths, lives in the middle east still.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|I'm not into DVD extras.  I almost never watch them.  I just finished watching the 2nd disc in this set, and it is worth the purchase price alone.  The Utah State Fair commercials are a riot, and the other extras are great.  Highly recommended for any ND fan.
B000ENV2P0|5.0|the red hot chili peppers have been known over the years for their in your face agressive funk rock, with keidis spitting lyrics and flea playing them riffs like a maniac, and john frusicante playing the guitar like it was on fire [the new hendrix anyone] and chad smith being the one putting the beat too hold the whole serade together   now since john frusicante return from his hell of dis-illusion   due to his heroin addiction the chili's changed their style of music for an more mellow sutle approach, to their disappoint of some fans, that wanted the no nosense abrassive band that gave us \\"give it away\\"     i've loved the new evolution of the chili's from californiation   and by the way[two classic albums]   these guys are in their mid forties that can't still being playing as if their was still spunk in their socks,   they wanted to add a new dimension too their music still keeping some of the funk intrusions on this album, in the likes of 21th century[classic flea]     god if a band doesn't changed it gets tarded with the same brush as metalica but if a band does change that get tard with selling out and making commerical music,   god sake this double album is their white album, phyiscal garfetti, or use your illision     this is an superb album with not one single dud   [well not to my ears i must concur bc we all have different tastes]     here's some of my highlights[they're all excellent]    Jupiter's highlights   dani california the classic first single with an catchy summer chorus 4.5  stadium arcadium when bands usally make title tracks to their albums they're fillers this is far from an filler BEAUTIFUL 5/5        she only eighteen keidis lyrics are superb 5/5   slow cheetah the slow acoustic mona lisa 10/5  wet sand i've heard this may be the new single i hope so an excellent classic and the ending with the line \\"you don't form in the wet sand i do\\" and the whole ombience is fantastic  2000/10    MARS:   the second course on the journey with the chili'smemerising   double album,   now this album starts off with a stomper just like jupiter   with dani california   well mars starts off with   \\"desecration smile\\" an acoustic beauty to weave an honesty into those that don't believe the chili's can do ballads   well this proves 'em wrong they can 6.5    she looks too me is another super high point,   an beautiful song 5.5    \\"she looks too me\\" may be pretentious too the eyes and ears that are formulated in just looking at the lyrics on the surface  but beneath you can tell it's got an religous undertone   4.5     \\"readymade\\" the funky hendrix song that's be sqaurming roud my head like flies on s*** in a good way it has frusicante on top form with an infectious riff   and the part where kiedis yells \\"clean it up johnny\\"   as frusicante goes into an fret w****** moment of aboslute bliss     \\"if\\" and \\"make me feel better\\" are those songs that after the fericous delievery of \\"readymade\\" keeps you high, but subtily,   choosing your course of an path     animal bar\\" the song doesn't make much sense to me in lyrical form but i don' care it's the music and the whole ombience of kiedis delivery that intrapicated me..CLASSIC LYRICS weird and wonderful     so much I\\"----see \\"if\\" and \\"make me feel better\\"     \\"storm in a teacup\\" now this made me want to dance like a demented chicken on an night out, funky brooding skillful chili's at hand here     \\"we beileve\\" some reviewers have stated that this is a cheesy pop song when the chili's get the choir to join in on the chorus   i say it adds to the dramatic, delieverence...wonderful     \\"turn it again\\" the last track before the end...it forfills it duties..and then some,     \\"death of a matian\\" now this has inticed me like no other finale track on any double album, it's a song of world renounce   it has all the qualities you'd expect from the chili's   listen to kiedis vocals at the end you'll see why this is one of the best productive songs the chili's have ever produce   [some say this song is about kiedis dog who knows?]     final summary,   the chili's deliever an double album of all killer and NO AND I MEAN NO FILLER WHAT SO EVER..one of the best albums by record buying hands has ever clspsed..  if you're an diehard fan of the early years then you'll be disappointed but if you like the chili's evolution of californication and by the way then you can't go wrong and you may not be like me and love every single track but at 2 hours and 28 tracks you'll find something that will surcome to your taste buds,   and if you've got an cd rewriter then you can compile the trscks you like onto one disc as some have quoted the chili's should of done i say NA the chili's WHITE ALBUM IS THE BEST ALBUM THIS YEAR AND WILL BE IN continous rotation for years to come until they release a new album..  what about the 14 tracks that was gonna make stadium arcadium a triple album ah flea...i hope they release it soon i've got a thrist for more chili music
B0000262QW|4.0|Released prior to his more familiar synth-laden jazz fusion offerings, this vibrant recording features Corea exclusively utilizing the electric piano to produce a quietly joyful sound.  The title track starts quietly with soft e. piano cadences, joined by Airto Moreira's innovative percussion.  Flora Purim, at the peak of her vocal abilities, insinuates herself into the mix, using her elegant voice as an instrument, segueing into a Joe Farrell flute solo.  The song diminishes and slows back to a Corea solo, then speeds into an effective blend of keyboard chords and Stanley Clarke's melodic driving bass.<br /><br />\\"Crystal Silence\\" features Farrell's delicate soprano sax.  \\"What Game Shall We Play\\" features words by Corea's longtime lyricist Neville Potter, which are brightly sung by Purim with a decidedly upbeat Latin edge.  \\"Sometime Ago-LaFiesta\\" spotlights each member of this extremely gifted band as they start out in a wistful ballad moving into a musical rendering of a Spanish Festival.  Recorded in February, 1972 for ECM records, \\"Return to Forever\\" was produced by Manfred Eicher
B000EULJLU|5.0|Ok...so im gonna review Tool's new album 10,000 Days. <br /> <br />As most Tool fans know (or should know) their last Album Laterus which came out in 2001 was the biggest album ever for this kind of music. Everything about it redefined music. 5 Years later, here they are again with their newest album 10,000 Days. Most Tool fans including me, were waiting for this album for quite awhile. Its been such a long time since they made a new album, but it is worth it! In my opinion, their best CD yet! If you like Laterus, you should definetly pick this one up. It continues where Laterus ended. When you purchase this album, not only do you get a kickass 75 minute + album, but you also get insanely awesome CD case that has goggles on it that you can view all the art of the album in 3d...its actually quite amazing, haha. So if you like Tool, or even if you never heard of them and want to get into them, I say pick up this album! or Laterus which comes in 2nd only to this album.
0060853964|5.0|I'm not going into any great detail, but this book has been atop my favorite book list for nearly a decade now.  It has fought off staunch competition, but it remains the one book that I read annually and have yet to grow tired of.  Funny, satirical, original, fun.  Pratchett in general is always a good read.
8590379825|5.0|I am new to Lua. While a C++ developer, having used Perl, Python and Ruby, I was suprised by how much you can do with this compact scripting language.<br /><br />The second edition is as eloquently written as the first (which is available online), but with new material and even more examples. In little time it introduced me to all aspects of the latest version of Lua -- 5.1 -- which includes a number of new features such as the new package system. Being a newcomer, it was nice to have a recent book covering all aspects of this latest version.<br /><br />The book is well organized. It works as both a primer and complete course on the langauge. It covers the basic tenets and first principles, as well as the subtleties. It is written in the spirit of Lua: accomplishing much in minimal space. It does so through crisp, engaging writing and thorough, well-crafted examples. It is one of those books that feels timeless -- so well done that you mark your name on it with a Sharpie.<br /><br />Lua is both a language and developer's tool. Part IV of the book, devoted to the C API, is as thorough for developers as the preceding parts are for language users. As I am using Lua in a multi-threaded environment, the second edition had the perfect example covering everything I needed to know -- from managing multiple states (interpreters) to wrapping C/C++ data structures.<br /><br />I was so pleased with the book, I emailed the author. If you use Lua, and especially if you are new to Lua, you won't be disappointed with this edition.

0143036556|4.0|There is an old saying, when referring to elected leaders, that says if everyone is unhappy, you must be doing something right.  The saying could probably be applied to this book as well.  The thesis that mankind can significantly alter his environment is self-evident (cities like New York and Tokyo don't spontaneously spring into existence!).  Diamond then makes the more controversial conclusion that the environmental choices made by civilisations are often the roots of their own downfall, and, by analogy, our current global civilisation is on the verge of another collapse. <br /> <br />Diamond is in his surest ground, and is the most convincing, when he's speaking of historic collapses.  He uses a number of examples of past societies that used up their \\"environmental capital\\" - by deforesting their lands, allowing topsoil to erode by poor agricultural choices, etc.  Once used, these resources are slow to recover, and the society that grew larger by spending the capital could no longer support their populations.  The society would then go into a \\"collapse,\\" which often included civil war, genocide, etc. <br /> <br />Diamond then proceeds to link these past societies with the present state of the world.  He points to modern-day hotspots of environmental catastrophe and links them with sites of modern-day social catastrophe.  Unfortunately, a skeptic will find much to disagree with in these passages of the book.  Diamond skillfully answers a number of objections, but appears to pick-and-choose examples that actually detract from his credibility by being too perfect.  For example, Rawanda, Somalia, Afganistan, and the former Fertile Crescent lands and obvious sites of both environmental and political problems.  But Diamond disengeniously omits a number of political hotspots (North Korea, Chad, the Congo) that are not suffering the same degree of environmental degredation.  Similarly, he paints a bleak picture of Australia's environmental prospects, but clearly it is not a country of major political strife.  Another spurious analogy: comparing Easter Island chiefs with the modern-day CEO's of major corporations seems like hysterical far-left finger pointing. <br /> <br />At the same time, though, Diamond is likely to anger that same far-left constituency by defending a number of big-businesses and globalisation.  In effect, he states that globalisation is good because it will force us to take a global view of environmental issues, which is definitely needed.  He also points out that trans-national businesses (oil and mining companies, etc.) are likely to be the conduits through which environmental progress is likely to occur, so these companies should be praised for any environmental initiatives.  It is this dual defense - of the environment and of big business - that makes the book so interesting.  It is also the source of Diamond's \\"cautious optimism\\" that our global society will not collapse. <br /> <br />As others have pointed out, there are some flaws.  He uses lists of examples as proofs of his theses.  He underemphasises the tendency of people to forget lessons learned (e.g. people went right back to gas-guzzling cars as soon as the last oil crisis passed).  He uses too much anecdotal evidence (a typical passage might begin \\"my friend in Borneo told me....\\", and use such a statement as proof).  But overall, I find his arguments convincing, and they are presented in a well-written fashion, so I recommend the book.
0553801503|2.0|I'm sorry to say it but this book was a chore to go through. Only one or two chapters (like where Brienne fights Biter) were exiting. <br />In the end of the book the author explains that instead of splitting one book into two parts, he decided to make two separate books which in short resulted in putting all the booring characters into this book. Big mistake I'd say. <br />As in all his books the writing is excellent but here you rarely got that nice urge of wanting to read the next page. <br />Anyways... The other books in this serie are absolutely marvellous and likely the remaining books will be as well. <br />
B0001DI0FI|4.0|There is an oft-quoted line from the movie: \\"This ship be home... this ship is England.\\"  The Royal Navy had such a tradition by 1805 (the year of this film) that its ships really were little floating islands of England.  This is both good and bad - it made them formidible opponents, was morale-boosting for the crew, etc.  Of course, it also embodied the imperialistic chauvenism of the English, as well as their stratified society.  These thoughts went through my head after watching \\"Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World\\" because the film so convincingly models the attitudes and feel of a 19th-century man-of-war. <br /> <br />I have not read the source material - the Maturin-Aubrey series by Patrick O'Brien - so I can't comment on the accuracy of the film to the books.  However, as director Peter Weir points out, the plots aren't nearly so important as the relationships between the boat and its crew, between the crew-members themselves, and the books' historical authority on the Age of Sail.  Thus, this doubly-named film (\\"Master and Commander\\" and \\"The Far Side of the World\\" are, in fact, two different stories) concentrates on the accuracy of costumes, rigging, and speech.  This accuracy is essential, as immerses the viewer into the film, so when the action does take place, it is all the more poignant.  The basic plot - Capt. Aubrey hunting a larger and better armed French ship around the Cape - allows for some spectacular footage.  There are the obligatory sea battles and a visit to the Gallopagoes (filmed on location in the very islands), but the best part of the film is probably the storm as the ship rounds the Cape of Good Hope.  Combining location footage, computer animation, and model work (both full and 1/6 scale), the storm is hang-on-to-your armrests convincing.  This brings up the point of the effects; they are so seamless that they are unnoticeable, and this is possibly the film with the best-ever visual effects. <br /> <br />So why only 4/5 stars?  Viewing this film on my system, it does move a little slow.  It works better in a movie theatre, I think, but since this is a review of the DVD, I have to deduct a star for the DVD-watching experience.  The extras on this two-disc set are interesting, but not complete.  There is ample footage of the film being made - including a 20-minute feature on the fantastic score and some deleted scenes - but there are no background featurettes on historical context, little on the anatomy/vocabulary of a square-rigged frigate, etc.  I think most people who would buy this DVD set would also be interested in this information, and not so much in information that is so similar to the extras on the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings special-edition DVD's.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Ranks with Battle of Britain in portraying some of the most realistic WW2 air combat ever put on film. The tight direction, despite several wordy interludes, propels the viewer up to the actual attack which culminates about 2/3rd's the way through. Understated acting by veteran TV actors Martin Balsam, EG Marshall and Jason Robards, in conjunction with a large Asian cast, keeps the story and plot on track to build momentum and drive the movie to its inevitable conclusion. Director Richard Fleischer effectively divides the story and allows the viewer to observe the planning and failures of both sides, making it a more complete depiction of what truly happened on that day.     Well worth multiple viewings and stands with Patton, Saving Private Ryan and Battle of Britain as some of the finest WW2 films ever made. Though for all it's cinematic greatness, it still flopped at the box office when released in September 1970. The reviews at the time intimated that the actual events the film was based on, were simply too depressing to enjoy. And no amount of acting or cinematography could compel ticket buyers to plunk down good money to see a movie with such a predictably, horrendous downer of an ending. Perhaps the addition of a major leading star could have excited the movie going public enough to look past the bleak storyline. Sadly, that mentality is indicative of the values of the American moviegoer.    Plays infinitely better though than the absolutely awful 2001 Micheal Bay directed Ben Affleck vehicle which only elicits snickers and chuckles at the absurd acting and preposterous plotline. I won't go into detail on that one, as there does not exist words that can aptly describe the sheer embarrassment of that \\"bomb\\". Suffice to say that the dialogue and screenplay is in the Ed Wood \\"Plan 9\\" territory.    One curious note though about this current re-release. The previous DVD release of Tora, Tora,Tora ran 149 minutes yet this new re-mastered edition clocks in at 144 minutes. Anyone have an idea why?

B000EDWKXI|3.0|For a film that impeccably recreates 18th century Venice with such dazzling exteriors, sumptuous costumes and beautiful Baroque music, it seems a shame that the story at the center is just a frothy, mechanical series of mistaken identity situations and contemporary-pitched comedy (I groaned when one character actually says during a chase scene in a carriage, \\"This is the last time I travel coach!\\"). After the lethargic family tensions of \\"An Unfinished Life\\", director Lasse Halstrom chooses to lighten up considerably with this fanciful account of the legendary lover, Giacomo Casanova. It seems that he is going for a \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" vibe but misses the depth of that film.<br /><br />For a while, the farcical elements are entertaining, but as the 2005 film goes along, it refuses to congeal into anything that takes advantage of its historical period or sheds any light into the title character beyond the formulaic romance. While he has the looks and wit to carry off the role, Heath Ledger is the most interior of actors and fundamentally cannot emit the joie de vivre that Casanova must have, something a more magnetic swashbuckler like Errol Flynn had in spades. A similar problem exists with Sienna Miller, who has the Katharine Hepburn role of a proto-feminist writing about women's rights under a male pseudonym. She is certainly pretty and intelligent enough but somehow does not register memorably as Francesca. Luckily, there are some fun sideline performances with Oliver Platt as the pasty-faced lard magnate Paprizzio, Lena Olin as Francesca's socially ambitious mother and Jeremy Irons especially over-the-top as the dastardly bishop Pucci.<br /><br />The actors, however, cannot escape the galloping momentum Hallstrom generates to produce the central halcyon of comedy shenanigans because screenwriters Jeffrey Hatcher and Kimberly Simi do not seem as interested in developing full characters. Regardless, there are some lovely scenes just to take in, even the obviously green-screened hot-air balloon ride amid fireworks over the Venice. Special credit especially needs to go to Alexandre Desplat's music score which mixes original compositions with Baroque masterworks from Vivaldi, Rameau, Albinoni and of course, Handel. The 2006 DVD contains a standard package of extras - an informative commentary track by Hallstrom, a brief making-of featurette, even briefer shorts on the costumes and Venice and an extended deleted sequence which goes into more specifics about the burgeoning love between Casanova and Francesca.hot-air balloon ride amid fireworks over the Venice.

B00000JNNY|5.0|It's amazing to think Etta James was just in her teens when these tracks were cut. The vocals on this collection of songs range from sassy to tender to broken-hearted to playful. Truly an incredibly gifted vocalist, and a great selection of tunes. The title track, often used in commercials and movies (perhaps a little too often), is one of the greatest love songs of all time and only hints at the variety herein. Get \\"At Last.\\" Play it at your cocktial parties, during romantic dinners or on a rainy, lazy Sunday morning at home. It delights, it thrills, and  it is an all time classic.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|First, allow me to offer this fact: I have been waiting for this movie to hit the shelves since 2000 (for those who are not fans of the PS One Game, this was announced 3 years after the game was created).<br /><br />Six years later, I had to drive 20 miles to get my hands on a copy on the release date. Once I was able to watch the movie on my HDTV with my surround sound, I would have to say the wait of 9 years from the release of the game was worth it. Most producers are known for pumping out titles for the sake of making money. The creators/directors for FFVII and FFVII: AC are concerned with a greater cause - the legacy of the game.<br /><br />While some of the reviews you will read will say there was not enough action, the fights were small, there wasn't a story, etc - you must keep one thing in mind: this movie was created for gamers who had the background of the game. This would create a maximum impact and the game and movie would synergize, creating a feeling unparalleled by any other series/game in the history of the genre or even game. Everytime I watch the movie and the crew attacks Bahamut (for those who haven't played the game, it is the giant dragon in the midgar square which also serves in the game as a summon) I get a sense of joy and it takes me back to the epic battles within the game.<br /><br />While the story may seem a bit stretched for some people, I think the plot and all of the details were all within reason. The movie is a fine extension of the game, told by those who were closest to the game.<br /><br />My only complaint might be the stretch about Rufus surviving (as well as some of the turks) the fatal blast eluded to in the first confrontation of Cloud, Rufus, Ruud, and Reno. Overall, it is a good extension and a fine job of clarifying some points I felt were left open in the game and provided a good history/refresh for those who have not played the game in a while.<br /><br />I feel the bottom line is this: there will be critics. Some will feel cheated by the \\"lack of action\\" or \\"lack of story\\" (which I feel to be completely false statements). But everytime I pop the DVD in my multi-disc player and turn on my Bose surround I start to get that feeling something great is about to happen. Once the musical score plays in the menu the hairs on my arms raise and stay up throughout the movie. The feeling of satiating my 9 year thirst for more FFVII is finally achieved at the battle between the good guys and bahamut. The rest of the movie is great, and the ending makes sense if you have played the game (the thought and ideology of Aeris can only be comprehended completely by one who has finished the game). I feel Cloud has finally gotten some much needed closure at the conclusion of the movie, and you feel as though the game has come full circle.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who has played and finished the game, and for those of you who haven't, you will finally get a sense of what you may have been missing for the last 9 years. If you do not at least watch this movie once, you are doing yourself a disservice - regardless to whether you have finished/played the game or not....cs.

The rest of the movie is great, and the ending makes sense if you have played the game (the thought and ideology of Aeris can only be comprehended completely by one who has finished the game). I feel Cloud has finally gotten some much needed closure at the conclusion of the movie, and you feel as though the game has come full circle.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who has played and finished the game, and for those of you who haven't, you will finally get a sense of what you may have been missing for the last 9 years. If you do not at least watch this movie once, you are doing yourself a disservice - regardless to whether you have finished/played the game or not....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|And sadly it was cancelled after half of a season! I am normally not much of a science fiction fan, but this series blew me out of the water. It has such an original take on the future by mixing spaceships and the Old West. This series also has so many great funny moments that you never get tired of watching any of the shows. (Wash and his dinosaurs!) It's also the only show I've watched in which I like ALL of the main characters. Each person brings an element to the show that would be missed terribly if they weren't there. I highly recommend owning this series.
B00003CX9E|1.0|I saw this movie and just about puked in my lap because it was so terrible!  Go see the Da Vinci Code instead.  Tom Hanks is ten times the actor Orson \\"Fatty McFat\\" Welles ever was! <br /> <br />Cheers.
B0000C8AVR|3.0|Although a good album, it definently is not great. none of the other tracks trancend the awesomeness of \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", and some of it actully sounds like(Gasp!, God Forbid!) country, but it is still a pretty decent album. <br />If you must know, I took it down a star because of the country. I hate country
B0000029GA|5.0|\\"Illmatic\\" has to be considered one of Hip-Hop's most prestige and acclaimed albums of all time. Clearly with one hot album, \\"Nas\\" (aged 20 at the time) was looked upon as one of Hip-Hop's promising premier rap-artists. This album really does showcase \\"Nas'\\" street-wise mentality and his superior thirst for knowledge with a vast amount of extended vocabulary used in every line he hits. It clearly shows that he was a pure Hip-Hop fan growing up listening to the likes of \\"Rakim\\" and \\"KRS One\\". This was certainly \\"Nas'\\" greatest work put on display.
B000AXRTPQ|5.0|I found this story impressive, because I know how incredibly hard it is for a woman to work full time and still be present for her husband and children. I admire any woman who pulls it off. Me, I tried hard to do it -- I planned to be a real success as a working mother -- but got lost in the rat race, and had to drop out several years ago. It's not a race that every woman can win (or even survive). I really appreciated the frankness of this book. Let's all just admit it, shall we? Those stupid Working Mother magazine covers that show peacefully smiling women executives holding their perfectly well-adjusted kids are just a big, fat, insane, ridiculous lie.  This book made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me angry that the world still judges women so harshly, whether we choose to work or not. We are all just women who love our kids and desperately want to be good enough at everything and make everyone happy: spouses, kids, bosses, colleagues, friends; but of course, not ourselves. Who has time for that?
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|For new stuff recorded and released in 2006, this is pretty HEAVY STUFF...almost too heavy, if that's possible?!  No really, I don't know ANY contemporary young bands who are laying it down as thick as Wolfmother - check out DIMENSION, MIND'S EYE, and more - some of the hugest riffs this side of your old Lep Zep or Sabbath LPs - sure it looks back, but it distills the BEST of stadium rock from the last three decades and mixes up a potent concoction.  Low price, classic cover art, what's not to like?
B000003TBP|4.0|Really 3 and a half stars, but I round up.  Unfortunately religion has crept into his work making the lyrics more pretentious and less insightful, despite the solid songwriting that defines the CD the songs many times fail to grab you. \\"Where It's At\\" was the first single and I don't need  another song written about the most overdone topic in rock, while others applaud it for some reason.  \\"The New Pollution\\" was the second single and to me this is formula at its most obvious.  I am glad I own this CD though. I love many of the experimental sounds added and \\"Devil's Haircut\\" is worth the price of admission by itself.  You can listen to this CD straight through, but it just doesn't match Mellow Gold or even Guero for it's abbility to draw you in.  Recommended for diehard Beck fans.
B000EOTTV8|5.0|Duncan Tucker's Transamerica could have easily been a docu-drama about life as a gender dysphoric individual, but instead transsexualism is merely a backdrop for the real story.  The fact that Bree Osbourne (Academy Award Nominee Felicity Huffman) is really a man does not overshadow or overpower the other interesting points in the story.  Yes, her (I will refer to Bree as a her from now on, since that's what the movie seems to do) sex does play into certain positions, but the film is really about two very unique people trying to form a steady relationship.  The film starts with Bree trying to get a form signed to give her permission to undergo gender reassignment surgery (as she later says, \\"They don't cut it off, you just have an inny instead of an outy.\\").  Her therapist does not give the permission, however, when Bree discovers that she fathered a son (it does sound wierd at first, but you'll get used to it after watching the film) before she had any plastic surgery, and when she lived her life as Stanley.  Bree travels from Los Angeles to a New York Prison where her illeged son Toby is being held for being a male prostitute.  In an attempt to get her therapist to sign the consent form, she embarks on a road trip cross country.  At first, she hopes to dump Toby off with his stepfather (his mother is dead) in Kentucky, but in a turn of events that isn't really all that shocking, they are forced to leave and head west towards Los Angeles, where Toby hopes to make it in the adult film industry.  On the way, Bree makes attempts, most of them failures, at parenting, but she soon discovers that it is extremely difficult when she learns of his addiction to cocaine and his constant troublemaking.  Toby and Bree couldn't be more opposite, transgender issues aside.  Toby is a \\"free spirit\\" who goes where he wants and does what he wants, whereas Bree is a conservative rule-follower (\\"I had to sleep on the ground last night!  With bugs!).  They get about to Texas, where Tobylearns of Bree's real sex and they pick up a hitchhiker who steals their car.  After riding in the back of a truck with some migrant workers, they come to a bar, where we meet Calvin (Graham Greene), a Native American with a not so native name.  Bree and Calvin form a strong relationship, and if left up to Calvin, he would have continued it much further, but, alas, they must indeed move on.  In what is really the last leg of the journey, Bree must move to a last resort decision and ask her parents for help getting to Los Angeles.  This is the most interesting part of the film, and it makes the right decision to be funny, but at the same time to not take the seriousness off of the confrontation between Bree and her parents, especially her mother, and their ability to deal with their son's decision.  Transamerica is definitely one of 2005's best films, and more importantly, the viewer must recognize that it isn't meant to be \\"provocative\\" in the sense of the term.  It is first and foremost a very funny movie, and at times there are personal beliefs of the director poking in through the movie, but mostly, it's a warm-hearted and very sweet movie, and it isn't meant to be taken with sheer seriousness.  Laugh and enjoy the wonderful writing, wonderful acting, and wonderful story.
1881273156|2.0|If you are a christian who believes in monogamous, heterosexual, covenant-style marriage, then this book is for you.  Liberally (I use the word loosely) sprinkled with paraphrases from the bible and modern conservative psychologists and philosophers, this book will not be of much help to polyamorists, bisexuals, gays or non-christians, unless you can take Mr. Chapman's aphorisms and apply his specific principles to your own general life.<br /><br />Fortunately, I am a gay male in a trinary, polyamorous, gay relationship with two highly intelligent, loving, forgiving, passionate and compassionte men.  We three are all speaking each others' love languages, in multiple dialects.  The book is merely affirming for us what we already practice full-time.  Humorous that we are already doing what Mr. Chapman suggests - and have been for almost two decades.  It didn't take a marriage; it took work.<br /><br />This book might open some eyes.  I began editing and correcting the genders, and relaxing the strict rules, almost from page one.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|When you take a long, hard, truthfull look at the material that is being released these days, it's hard not to be disappointed with the state of the music industry. Absolute trash that is released from \\"American Idol\\" wannabe's and manufactured pop stars like the Simpson sisters or the latest \\"Rap\\" artist to strike a pose and present themselves as the latest \\"playa\\", really just are not my idea of talent nor entertainment. Among these horrible displays of musicianship and taste, every now and then an artist releases a real quality creation. David Gilmour has achieved just that with this stunning display of a true master at his craft. The songs sound fresh and yes, very Floydian. The production quality is what you would expect from a musician of Mr. Gilmours caliber. It sounds spectacular.<br /><br />Every song is worth listening to, as is the album, from beginning to end. Dave is in fine form vocally and unlike many vocalists from his era, has not lost his range or his taste.<br /><br />The guitar sound is soulfull and cosmic as is always the case with a David Gilmour release. I've enjoyed this album beginning to end several times now and although not as heavy sounding as a Pink Floyd album, it is definitely deep. Maybe Gilmours deepest offering yet. Kudos to Dave for doing an album his way and giving us another outstanding offering. After almost 40 years, the man still has it.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|In 1963, two young men Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are searching for summer work.  They find this in Brokeback Mountain in a small Wyoming city.  What they find is much more than just summer work; rather, much more than what they expected.  After months of staying in the camp site hurdling sheep and other duties, they find love within one another.  Neither had examined their sexualities before arriving at Brokeback Mountain.  The end of the summer leaves them heartbroken due to the separation.  Ennis stays in Wyoming, marries a woman named Alma, and has two girls.  Jack moves to Texas, intenses his career as a cowboy, marries a woman named Lureen, and has a boy.  Five years later, Ennis and Jack reunite and discover that their love they shared remains.  However, society and the times prevent them from sharing the love as deep as their desires.  This relationship leads to romance and heartbreak. <br /> <br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\", adapted from the short story of the same name by Annie Proulx, was beautifully crafted by its cast and crew.  It proceeded to receive nominations and win several major awards, including eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) leading to three wins (Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score).  Its emotional impact remains alive throughout the film.  They beautifully express the characters' pain and turmoil caused by a homophobic society.  This adaptation is one of the best screenplays written in many years.  Few other filmmakers have crafted a storyline that compiles twenty-five years of events within only two hours while sharing its story so deeply.  Its storyline placement and series of events proved highly difficult, yet succeeded in many ways. <br /> <br />Many are quick to label \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" a gay film.  However, it is much more than that.  It is a story of love, secrets, loneliness, and struggle to express their true selves.  This is one of many qualities that make this film so groundbreaking.  Therefore, its viewers will quickly recall the characters Ennis and Jack and how much of an impact they made.  This is the first film with a romance of two people of the same sex as its primary subject line to receive such critical success.  Therefore, this will surely open doors for other filmmakers to continue pushing the envelope. <br /> <br />This film could not have been so monumental through its emotional stance if it wasn't for the actors' hard work.  Three of its eight Oscar nominations were for acting: Best Actor (Heath Ledger), Best Supporting Actor (Jake Gyllenhaal), and Best Supporting Actress (Michelle Williams).  For years, Ledger and Gyllenhaal have been underrated talent-wise, despite several wonderful performances (Ledger's \\"The Patriot\\", \\"Monster's Ball\\"; Gyllenhaal's \\"The Good Girl\\", \\"Donnie Darko\\").  Ledger's performance as Ennis, a quiet and lonely man, showcases his talents further than in the past.  Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack, an eccentric and and outgoing man, fits well with Ennis and the overall film.  Williams and Anne Hathaway successfully placed their teenage image aside for the film.  Williams proves that she is much more than just \\"Dawson's Creek\\" as the lonely and gentle Alma.  Hathaway proves that she is much more than just \\"The Princess Diaries\\" as the sassy and feisty Lureen. <br /> <br />Such film quality proves that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" will stand beyond the test of time.  Therefore, this is destined to become a classic.  Hopefully by that time, the government will have legalized same-sex marriage.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I must say this album took me in a different direction than American Life. COAD has a lighter, easier, and bouncier sound than the more darker, angry undertone that was American Life, even more than Music before it. Madonna knew to create something familiar and she didn't disappoint. COAD from start to finish was done as a 12 track disco rundown of classic Madonna style, think (Madonna-the first album or Like a Virgin) when it was about having a good time. This is club music, damn near rave music. I enjoy all the songs on this album for different reasons and if you are a Madonna fan or have been at some point, this album will be comfort food for you. I was happy Hung up hit the top ten on Billboard #7, although I'm very bothered by Sorry hitting #58, due to lack of radio airplay. My favorite songs are a tie between Sorry and Like It or Not. I hope she wins a Grammy for this album, either Best Pop Vocal Album or Dance Recording.
B00009Z576|4.0|It's interesting that this underappreciated jewel in the Yes archive was their return to form after a less-than-stellar latter half of the '70s, considering Trevor Horn is singing here.  I am sure it is due to the fact that he brought new ideas to the band with his lyrical approach, since the band certainly seemed to be in search of an identity on underwhelming albums like _Tormato_ and _Going for the One_.  They didn't seem to be like this much of a band since 1974's excellent _Relayer_.  Interesting, considering Rick Wakeman played on both _Tormato_ and _Going for the One_ and Patrick Moraz covers the keyboards on _Relayer_ and Geoff Downes (the other half of the Buggles pair here--\\"Yes! Yes!\\") handles the synth arsenal on _Drama_.<br /><br />And they didn't even fit every good song they had written on the original release (check out _The Word Is Live_ for a few decent songs that didn't make it).  Whereas _Going for the One_ had a couple strong songs and _Tormato_ maybe had one--at the most two--this one has at least three really strong songs, if not four.<br /><br />The whole affair starts off with \\"Machine Messiah.\\"  This one features Steve Howe sounding very inspired, but the whole song is not as chill-inducing as Yes at their best, though it is certainly a strong song.  At least everyone sounds crackling, something an honest listener couldn't say about hardly any moment on _Tormato_.  No, everyone starts to crackle for real on \\"Does It Really Happen?\\", one of the songs here that I rank amongst Yes's finest (buy this album if you want to hear it, because it's not on any live compilations or best-of packages, like all the songs here--the Trevor years are banished from Yesdom, for the greater part).  It's something about Trevor's writing and voice here; he seems inspired (as who wouldn't be?) by the fact that he is with what is likely the best rock combo ever.  You can listen to this song over and over and experience the patent Yes euphoria every time--gorgeous harmonies, big mix, expansive effects, alluring time changes.  The great thing is, it's Yes with a difference.<br /><br />The next song, \\"Into the Lens,\\" is another Yes classic, with the inescapable refrain \\"I am a camera.\\"  This is a great example of early synth processing of the human voice that Horn and Downes went on to launch MTV with as heard in \\"Video Killed the Radio Star.\\"  It's certainly not all about the synths, though, as the entire band hits an emotional chord once more on par with the best of Yes.  You can see the video of this on the VHS tape documenting Yes's shorts, fortunately, but again, there are no other audio releases where you will hear this masterpiece.<br /><br />\\"Run Into the Light\\" is another strong song somewhere near the par of \\"Machine Messiah,\\" but a little of a let-down after the unabating scintillation of the two previous songs.  Yes give you a little more on the Chris Squire-driven \\"Tempus Fugit,\\" once more on the level of the best they've ever done, and what should rightly be considered the band's theme song with Downes's processed synth refrain of \\"Yes! Yes!\\" undulating in waves of ecstasy across the terrain of the song.  The band almost sounds punk here with its unrelenting pummeling of their instruments and Horns's exuberant vocals; Alan White's drums almost approach the uninhibited aura of Bill Bruford on the earliest Yes albums, a lofty mark.  They hadn't sounded as on fire since \\"Heart of the Sunrise.\\"<br /><br />There are three certain classics here (out of six songs), which doesn't quite put it on par with _Close to the Edge_, which is nothing but classics, or _Fragile_, _The Yes Album_, or _Relayer_, which are almost wall-to-wall classics.  It is the album that reinvigorated Yes to create _90125_, where Trevor Horn receded to the mastering knobs.  You can do a whole lot worse than this in the Yes catalog and not that much better, whatever Jon Anderson's wishes may be.  Actually, Jon Anderson should thank Horn and Downes along with the rest of us, 'cause this is the album that made them a great band again.  Buy this.Downes along with the rest of us, 'cause this is the album that made them a great band again.  Buy this.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|I have been a big rhcp fan for years now, everyone seems to have different favorite stages of the band. The way I approached this album was starting at Blood Sugar, Californication, and By the Way. In relation to those, this album is probably the worst. Thats not to say it doesnt have some decent songs, but the overprocessed mixing and trite funk licks barely posess the same raw energy the band once had. Albeit, there are 28 tracks and I'm sure everyone is bound to find a handful of favorites. I would recommend it to any fan, but it is defenitely no masterpiece
B000069AUI|2.0|If you want to give these guys credit for anything, they certainly deserve credit for taking soft rock all the way to the top again. They should be called Radioplay because they take basic elements of the Radiohead sound (not the experimentation) and set it to easy-on-the-ears melodies, beats, and lyrics. \\"Lost in Love\\" has nothing on this one. I'm actually eagerly anticipating the Coldplay covers album of Air Supply. \\"All Out of Love\\" with a brittle beat--that will really be something!
0307165485|5.0|This is such a perfect gift to give a friend expecting a baby, or a friend with a child already.  If you haven't grown up with this book in your life, now is the time to experience it.  The illustrations vary from line cartoons to beautiful works of art.  Simple stories that stay with you.  From start to finish, this book has true character and will always be a cherished classic.  I'm a child of the 70s - Richard Scarry books were always in our house, and still are.
B000002UB6|5.0|It's interesting how much \\"Let it Be\\" gets written about when it's supposed to be such a weak album.  Personally, the group of songs sung from the rooftop of their recording studio, \\"Get Back,\\" \\"I Dig a Pony,\\" \\"I Got a Feeling,\\" \\"One After 909\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" are how I want to remember the lads.  Finally, oh finally, they emerged from the throes of their studio tricks into the cold, brisk air of a January, London morning and gave us some genuine Beatle rock 'n' roll.  <br /> <br />For those forty odd minutes, they were a band again, and with Billy Preston supplying some additional punch on the keyboard, it's great material and very addictive.  As an aside, I love the Anthology 3 version of \\"Get Back,\\" both because of the \\"Get back, Loretta, you've playing on the rooftops again\\" ending and the raw quality of John's lead guitar.  If you don't remember the movie, try to find a CD version. The studio \\"fooling around\\" version of \\"Two of Us\\" is priceless because Paul does his Elvis imitation while crooning \\"Two of us have memories, longer than the road that stretches out ahead.\\"  That bit should have been left in the version that was released.
0060930187|4.0|The Bell Jar is a book that came to me via a monologue I once heard given by the character Chris Stevens of Northern Exposure fame. I don't remember the context, nor the message, nor even the general idea of what was said. All I remember was the name of the author, and the name of the book. It stuck with me for a long time, and finally it bubbled up and found its way to my book pile. Eventually, it got read. <br /> <br />Now that you know the story of my coming upon The Bell Jar, I suppose it would be appropriate to give a reasonable explanation of what I thought of it. Having bridged the subject, I find it difficult to do. The book is easy to read, probably taking me 4 days of sporadic reading to finish it. Be warned though, the book is certainly not light reading material. <br /> <br />The subject matter is dark, in the realm of a more mature I Am The Cheese or The Chocolate War. I felt a lot of resonance between those Robert Cormier books and this by Sylvia Plath. I hated Cormier's books - the same cannot be said of this. While I did find it difficult material, it was not inherently cruel. It was troubling, yet truthful throughout. The struggle that Platt endures is tough reading, especially when you know this is a real story. Granted it was told through her looking glass, so you have to take that into consideration. Still, it's pretty dramatic no matter what your perspective. <br /> <br />The chapter at the end of the book I read was an additional biographical note by Lois Ames, and in it we find a little of what happened to Plath after the book ends. It brings things together, in a sense. In a very real way it comes as no surprise to read those pages. I'll leave it at that, since there is already too much between the lines for the unknowing reader to glean from. <br /> <br />In a strange way this book is a modern classic. It will likely not sit on the pedestal that The Good Earth will occupy (another recent read, thus the reference). Written in the 1950s, it relates well to a lot of what is happening today, in 2006. You could take out various items that date the book, release it now, and today's reader would be none the wiser. While the inherent subject matter is not confidence building or heart-warming, it does show people what they feel is not a solitary emotion. <br /> <br />This book is not for everyone. It's not a happy book, written in a happy place. It is not a corollary to Harry Potter, it is not a sequel to Charlotte's Web. The book is loaded with dark text, showing the dark inner thoughts of a young woman in the dark world that we live in. Entertaining, even funny at times, the subject material is surely serious and the potential reader should be ready for the like. <br /> <br />Some call this a young woman's Catcher in the Rye. It's been too long since I read that book to say. Still, I certainly recommend this book. Well done and appropriate even for this day and age.
0307277674|1.0|As far as good reading, I found this book slow and loaded with bad history.  I've read enough historical fiction to have a comparision and I also have read enough ancient chruch and and ancient history to know that the claims are weak if not laughable.<br /><br />  Beyond the obvious what Dan Brown's book really is, is an introduction to semi-gnostic paganism vieled in Christian languague and history to give it a facade of respectablility.  In some ways this is Dan Browns gospel, his religion.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Brave New World and Dance Of Death are far more superior then any other Iron Maiden stuff. The quality of the music has improved a lot. I love this progressive direction the guys go. It's clearly that Iron Maiden fans don't want anything new, they want the old Iron Maiden style and nothing else. They aren't in for a change. Well, I am in for a change, and this music is fantastic. The quality of the music has improved a lot. The music is more interesting now. I hope that Iron Maiden will continue making progressive metal like this. Dance Of Death and Brave New World are my favorite Iron Maiden albums.
0307276902|4.0|After I saw the controversy on [...] regarding this book, I had to read the book. This book is very well written and you can't put it down, but not all of it is true: The parts where he is wanted in three states is not true. But also keep in mind, some writers make up stuff in books in order to sell the little suckers. That's just my two cents.     Anyway, Like I said before, this book is very well written and you can't put it down. My only complaint is that I wished he didn't make up the jail parts. But that's just my opinion.
B000CNFC76|5.0|To fully appreciate THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED, it's good to compare it with BOBBY JONES, STROKE OF GENIUS. Both films cost between $20M and $25M. Both were about the game of golf at the turn of the 20th century. Both focused on young, underprivileged underdogs who went on to become the best amateurs in the game, beating out their professional competition. And both show the influence of the great Harry Vardon.<br /><br />BOBBY JONE, STROKE OF GENIUS, of course, is about Bobby Jones, only amateur ever to win all three tournaments of the Grand Slam in the same year. And he did it while also working on three college degrees simultaneously - thus the \\"Genius.\\" Jim Caviezel (Passion of the Christ) did a decent job playing Bobby, although he didn't look anything like the man. And Aiden Quinn was good as Harry Vardon - even down to his golfing ability - although he was all but cut from the film because he wouldn't shave a goatee he had grown for another film.<br /><br />While BOBBY JONES is about an entire golf career, THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED is about one tournament: the 1913 US Open, held at Brookline Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts. That was the year that a caddie - Francis Ouimet, who lived across the street from the country club - beat the two top British professionals, including Harry Vardon, and won the tournament - the biggest upset in golf history. Shia LeBeouf (Holes) does a great job playing Ouimet, and Stephen Dillane (The Hours) is superb as Vardon.<br /><br />The biggest difference between these two films is in the direction. With BOBBY JONES, Rowdy Herrington (Road House) opted to do a very straight drama in the tradition of Chariots of Fire. It turned out to be far more than he could handle. The script is weak. There is far too much time spent on the young Bobby Jones, which contributes very little to the main plot. And visually, it is, well, boring. There are only a handful of creatively interesting shots.<br /><br />But in THE GREATEST GAME, director Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, acting) pulls out all the stops. Not only is the script taut, but every part of it is essential. And the visuals are incredible, including effects that have never been seen in a sports film before, let alone one about golf. The art direction - including sets, costumes and graphics - is also superb, creating a totally believable and visually sumptuous world. You don't have to love golf to love this movie. That can't be said about BOBBY JONES. While both films have heart, THE GREATEST GAME also has fun.<br /><br />When I first saw THE GREATEST GAME, there were a couple of things that bothered me. I didn't feel the love relationship between Francis and Sarah Wallis (Peyton List) was believable because their ages seemed so different. I just couldn't see her falling for a boy. I also had trouble accepting a ten-year-old caddy, Eddie Lowery, played like a true ham by Josh Flitter. It seemed like a typical Disney element (the kid who is smarter than the adults that surround him), and I just didn't buy into it. Then I discovered that that really was the way it was! Which doesn't make it any easier to believe, but at least it's true.<br /><br />These are two very different films about similar events. While BOBBY JONES STROKE OF GENIUS is a good film (3 to 4 stars), THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED is a great film (5 stars). Both directors had a vision; but Bill Paxton has proven that he can carry his out.<br /><br />Waitsel SmithATEST GAME, director Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, acting) pulls out all the stops.

It's quickly climbing up on my favorites list, even as I listen to it for just the second time. I haven't even seen the movie yet, but I can already tell that this music will just add layers to the film.<br /><br />Completely incredible. I love it. 5+ stars.
B000E5N62U|4.0|Mixing the characteristic sound he established with Steely Dan and his two previous solo albums Fagan's \\"Morph the Cat\\" doesn't plow any new ground but then it's not suppose to--Fagan's literate lyrics, wry observations and sarcasm are in place providing a cool alternate to the funk-jazz sound that has dominated the last couple of Dan albums and his solo work.<br /><br />While some of the tracks go on a bit too long (\\"The Great Pagoda of Funn\\" and \\"Security Joan\\" for example)all of them create their own delicious groove that you either want to give into or at the very least tap your feet along to. As with previous Fagan solo albums I want to give them a listen. Fagan may not be making the same type of music he made on \\"The Royal Scam\\" but then he's not the same person he was nearly 30 years ago. This reflects where Fagan is now emotionally and as a musician.<br /><br />Even \\"The Great Pagoda of Funn\\" with its witty lyrics and the sensuous sax trumpet solo and light jazz piano chords has its pleasures. I missed Fagan on his solo stop in the San Francisco Bay Area but hope to catch him during the Steely Dan tour. Hopefully he'll play the best tracks from this strong album.<br /><br />I'd love to see \\"The Nightfly\\" reissued with the pair of solo singles that Fagan recorded for a couple of movies and with remastered sound. \\"The Nightfly\\" still stands as my favorite Fagan solo album with its concept of growing up in the paranoid world of the 50's and worshipping jazz, be-bop and early rock music. Hopefully Warner will get around to it and reissue it as a Dual Disc (one that hopefully plays on computers as well as CD players).
1592400876|2.0|To Teh Ai Lee \\"Alice\\" below: <br />The error on the cover to which \\"Bookman\\" refers (I assume) is not the comma in the title - it's the unhyphenated compound modifier, zero-tolerence, in the subtitle. <br />Perhaps that's a British English vs. American English issue - but it's pretty funny when talking about a lack of tolerence for incorrect punctuation.
0385504209|1.0|I decided to read this book one recent afternoon so I could legitimately comment on it and well...I'm just shaking my head in disbelief that 60 million imbeciles have not only shelled out real money for this literary Ambien but actually enjoyed it. And yet the talentless fair-haired boy, Dan Brown, just keeps smiling vapidly and watches the cash keep rolling in, to my increasing frustration. Even putting aside the blasphemy and the_monumental_bald-faced lies about historical figures, we're left with plenty to object to in the forgettable characters, the convoluted and boring plot, the laughably predictable plot \\"twists\\" (he employed most of them in \\"Angels and Demons\\"), and the bland, puerile writing. I just don't get it. I just do not get it at all.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I recently wrote a review for 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik', the Chilis 1991 masterpiece, mentioning in it about how I hoped this album would contain guitar solos that really sounded heavy - like a rock bands solos should, not like the largely acoustic disappointment which was 'By The Way'.....I was not disappointed. This album is amazing through and through, and although as an overall listening experience it will appeal more to the 'funk era' fans of the band, all Chilis fans should pick this up.    This is the Chilis second best album, after BSSM, and the major reason for it's success is the Chilis returning to either writing funky songs or just brilliant rocks songs. As other reviewers have mentioned, John Frusciante is all over this album. Nearly every track on both disc 1 (Jupiter) and disc 2 (Mars) features a guitar workout at the end, and John shows that when he lets rip, he can really play. He really hasn't let rip like this since BSSM, and the Chilis haven't written funky rock songs this great since then either, (check out my BSSM review to see what I'm talking about). Even though this will totally appeal to fans of BSSM and before, like me, it can also appeal to 'By The Way' fans if they give it a real chance. Every track is given the patented Rick Rubin studio polish; and touches like harmonized vocals, etc. that were dominant on 'By The Way' can also be found here. 'Stadium Arcadium' also has a few slow songs, but they don't grate in the same way as they did on 'By The Way' mostly because they nearly all feature a great guitar solo and are nearly always followed by a either funky number or a great rocker. The slower songs on `Stadium Arcadium' are also normally always better than the slow songs which were all over `By The Way'.    It seems to me that either 'By The Way' was a joke album, or a sell-out album, attempting to make as many sales as possible and create a mega-fanbase. This is a cynical view I know, but if it was the latter, then it certainly worked,as the Chilis are one of the biggest bands in the world right now, and on 'Stadium Arcadium' they're showing the world what kind of music they really want to make. As I mentioned in my review for it, BSSM is my favourite album ever by anyone, and right now, 'Stadium Arcadium' is roughly my 4th or 5th fave. I'm into a LOT of different music, ranging from classic Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin etc. through to modern bands such as Jamiroquai, the Chilis and then Interpol to Stereophonics. 'Stadium Arcadium' is seriously brilliant.    Any reviews that claim this would have been better had it been cut down to a single disc are simply wrong. Maybe there are 1 or 2 duffers, but not enough essential tracks to only warrant one disc. As far as double albums go, I reckon it's more consistently strong than the Beatles 'White Album'.....it is however beaten by Genesis 'Lamb Lies Down' and Floyds 'The Wall'. 'Stadium Arcadium' isn't perfect, that honour is reserved for BSSM, (lets ignore the last track on BSSM even exists!) but it's damn close. It would be really difficult to pick a favourite track, but if pushed I'd have to go for 'She's Only 18' on Jupiter, as it's got great funky verses, an incredible harmonized hard rocking anthemic chorus, and a guitar solo par-excellence. The brilliant thing is there are at least 12 other tracks across both discs which are nearly as good.    If you're a true Chilis fan, then you'll love 'Stadium Arcadium'. Simple as that.    Cheers for reading.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|What a kooky, lovable, sometimes just much too silly movie.  I absolutely love it.  It is one of my favorite movies of all times.  In fact, after seeing it, I immediately began learning Salsa.  I'll pass on the Pasa Doble, thanks.  Though \\"Scott\\" is supposed to be the focus of the film, \\"Fran\\" steals the show after she washes her face and puts on something nice.  In fact, she and Scott's father (both rather pathetic characters) steal the show.  Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!  I think I'll put the DVD in right now!
B000000OTY|5.0|I am a long time Peter Gabriel fan from the early days (I went to the \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" show when he was still the driving force behind Genesis). As musical taste and life priorities change I had really not followed his career for a number of years and just recently viewed the DVD at a friends house. The next day I purchased both the DVD and CD and feel compelled to write a combined review for both items, if only to answer some of the low star reviews it has received in the past (obviously not too many as you can see from the high star overall).  <br /> <br />This concert is wonderful the musicianship & staging are astounding, and the vocals angelic (aka Paula Cole!). I would recommend it to any rock, progressive and roots music fan. The African influenced rhythms, melodies and dancing (DVD) bring the kind of joy that compells you to get up and move. There are also fun rocking versions of old favorites that get the crowd energy going. It is total fun with cerebral message and lyric. <br /> <br />I could go on and on but I won't say any more, other than to encourage you to buy this CD and also the DVD, they are both wonderful!
B000000LZV|3.0|3 1/2 stars        ....the parts seem to outweigh the whole on this one for me. While no one in their right mind could criticize this album for it's lack of punk ambition and fluidity amongst it's trio of players, the quite unique 43 song lineup does have some drawbacks. The songs are often catchy, and do vary in style-but through the album's continuously abrupt changes due to the material's one-versed nature, an audio pattern resulting in immersion apathy does in fact creep in towards this band's innovative sound. Do not let this less then perfect note convince you that this is not the innovative punk masterpiece it is generally perceived as being, because it is-albeit appreciated best(much like the band's format) in strong, short blasts.
068483605X|4.0|\\"Watership Down\\" is about a group of rabbits who leave their community to make a new community after one of them  has a vision of death coming to their home. On their journey to make a new community they face danger from predators and other rabbits.  <br /> <br />Shortly after I finished reading \\"Watership Down\\" someone asked me what I thought of it. I did not know how to answer this question.  I had been so preoccupied  thinking about who are the fathers of two female rabbits' babies in the book to really think about how much I like or dislike the book.  After thinking about that question for a while I think I can answer it better. <br /> <br /> I like how this book taught me a little bit about rabbits as well as entertained me. I did not know that female rabbits were the ones who usually dig burrows. I assumed that all rabbits dig burrows. The author, Richard Adams, based his book on facts and mentions  Mr. R. M. Lockley and his book \\" The Private Life of Rabbit\\" in the Acknowledgment of  \\"Watership Down\\"  and in another part of the book.  <br /> <br />This book was a nice break from the type of books I usually read, which contain some kind of love story. The rabbits in \\"Watership Down\\" may feel attracted to the opposite sex but there is no romantic love story.  <br /> <br />Athough  I did not stay up reading this book until one o'clock in the morning, reading it did cut into my TV watching time.  <br /> <br />Overall I do not consider reading this book a waste of my time.  If I could give this book 3.5 stars, I would since the answer of the question of what I thought of the book could be \\"Ok\\" or \\"I like it\\" depending on  who is asking me and my mood at the time.  A lot of times I am leaning towed \\"Ok\\" because that question I had about who are fathers of two female rabbits' babies really bothered me for a week or two after I read \\"Watership Down.\\" <br />
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Not too hard, not to soft.. just right.  Really enjoyed this.  If you grew up listening to Sabbath, Ozzy etc your going to like this album.
B00005JOQT|5.0|singer's x-men 2 could easily be considered drek, but if you're into light entertainment everyonce in a while it's an averagely good film. Singer seems to have a good track record for this film, Kevin Spacey seems perfectly cast as Lex and resembles hackman, though noone could beat the great Gene Hackman as luthor. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane seems miscast, noone could beat margot kidder's role. Jimmy olsen, sofar seems miscast with corny line-delivery. Perry White/ completely miscast with Langella. Brandon routh seems fine for the role having some vague resemblance to christopher reeves. but what is it with Lois having a kid? it rewrites comic book history. Since when is lois all of the sudden a mother?? and is just obvious fodder to reinforce the targetting of the 5-9 yr old age group by throwing in a kid prop. <br />As for the hardcore religious fans bitching that the 'S' is too small and not big enough, look at the first superman comic, the S is even smaller & narrower.who cares? <br />The effects of this film from watching the trailers on bluetights.net look pretty f**king awesome, it will be steps above the matrix I'm sure. This will be an overall entertaining film.  <br />The whole romance/love story thing i think will be something out of a soap op, and seems engineered just to bait the female audience in, because I really don't care about superman's relationship problems. I haven't seen the film yet of course, but it's obvious that they are trying to please everyone and that's impossible. I think if this movie sucks, Singer should take notes from Richard Nolan who made the most plausible, literal and realistic superhero film of all time with batman begins with complex character storylines/performances and a great plot (though the end was revelational yet disappointing). I'm sure this film will be great, but most of the cast with the exception of Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey and Langella have very limited acting experience.but its a popcorn film afterall and I think from what I've read of the spoilers some of the plot ideas seem pretty cool.only lex is in this one it seems, wait a couple years for the sequel when Supes fights a real villain, and hopefully it's not a giant terminator monster absorbing metal please
B000028U0Y|2.0|Honestly, I don't find much here to like.  With a few exceptions (e.g. Jackson)the songs all sound pretty much the same and it's tough to make it through the whole album as a result.  This leaves the album to stand on its lyrics which paint a colorful picture of Cash's life as a violent criminal.  Of course, Cash wasn't a violent criminal, he's just another musician who got strung out on drugs.  So here we have a recovering addict playing the role of a violent felon in an attempt to seem \\"real\\" to his audience of violent felons.  This makes the whole thing seem really fake to me and sad for Cash when I give this album a listen.
B000F0UUIM|4.0|The quality of the prior Searchers DVD version was already close to perfect, so this new release is likely to be awesome. And the 30-minute featurette, \\"The Turning of the Earth: John Ford, John Wayne and The Searchers,\\" is a terrific item to have. (It was last available on the videotape version.) <br /> <br />This movie, as classic and as good as it is, tends to get over-praised in my view. Although it is not good form to cross quote, another commenter here has it exactly correct where he wrote: <br /> <br />\\"...the film as a whole falters because too many aspects of it are frustratingly under-developed...Its attempt at humor with Martin and his Comanche bride is awkward and mean-spirited; Scar is a stock villain devoid of any depth, and the swiftness in which Debbie changes allegiances is jarring...The parallels between Ethan and Scar and not pursued to much satisfaction. Both men have legitimate reasons for their hate but (the movie) fails to examine how each man mirrors the other...Despite all its ambition, 'The Searchers' comes up short in the end.\\" <br /> <br />Yep, that captures it exactly. -- (And my smallest complaint has always and ever been that the door-closing moment should have been made to happen so much more s-l-o-w-l-y...) <br /> <br />Fort Apache (coming new to DVD!) -- and also the movie Stagecoach for that matter -- both hit closer to motion-picture making perfection. Still, the Searchers is a classic western and this new release is gladly welcomed, and not only for Max Steiner's music and those stunning views of Monument Valley.
B00009Z574|5.0|I know that most Yes fans don't agree with me on this one. My judgment is admittedly skewed, because \\"Tormato\\" was the first Yes album I heard as a kid. Most people already had familiarity with \\"Close to the Edge\\" and \\"Fragile\\", and that extended-progressive-jam sound was what Yes fans had come to expect. \\"Tormato\\" is not typical Yes. There are some longer arrangements here, but a lot of the prog rock self-indulgence (like \\"Relayer\\") is missing. <br /> <br />Yes had not yet developed the shorter, polished cuts of their 80s resurgence, but some of \\"Tormato\\" could have been very radio-friendly. \\"Release,Release\\" is a very engaging piece of rock and roll. The talk-box guitar solo from \\"Arriving UFO\\" is still one of those moments when I am compelled to turn the stereo up. <br /> <br />I think the friction between band members at the time may be why this album is so interesting. At times it almost has the flavor of jazz fusion, and it's very funky. The drums and bass carry the listener effortlessly. \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" grooves from the first to the last note, sliding into quiet areas, only to jump maniacally back into the closing sequence of the album--with guitar, synthesizer, and bass combining juicy riffs. <br /> <br />For many, the sound of rock in the late 70s is epitomized by Boston or some punk band. For me, it's also \\"Tormato\\". <br /> <br />The extra tracks on this remastered edition are okay, but they don't really add anything.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Miller's Crossing has a fairy-tale quality about it. Within the homey and narrow scope of what it's doing, it succeeds superbly. The character work and cinematography are outstanding, and the music is an integral element, too.     The story is circumscribed and without overt interest in seeking to move you very deeply but it is neither distant nor dry or cold, either. On first viewing, it strongly led me to view it a second time to catch the threads and dialogue I knew were there but missed on the first run through.    Of all the Coens' work, only \\"Brother, Where Art Thou\\" comes close, almost. TIME Magazine's \\"All Time 100 Best Films\\" list (drawn up by Richard Schickel and Richard Corliss) has Miller's Crossing in its ranks, but nary a Fargo to be found. Certainly the two gents had to negotiate their pick, and it was Miller's Crossing that they chose.    My favorite little nugget is when Tom gets roughed up in the warehouse, and I'm certain you can hear the brief sound of whooping and hollering Indians on thundering horseback as he goes unconscious.    I absolutely love Miller's Crossing, and I want me' hat, too.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|This Blondie compilation is the best, to date that there is. It's got all of the hits and then some. Blondie always had fun songs and this disc reflects that. The sound is also great, too. Whether you are a casual, or serious Blondie fan, you should have this, it is an essential part of rock and pop history. They definately did this compilation right. Highly recommended.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|I do like this cd but i find myself skipping over alot of songs...not only that but i kinda liked corey's scream better when he was tearing his vocal cords up, like on iowa or s/t... On this cd his scream sounds weak compared to what it use to... I'd have to say i like the softer songs on this cd better then the heavy ones... If i want to listen to heavy slipknot i'll just put in there s/t or iowa... Plus, the cd sounds muffled to me...
B00007L4MJ|3.0|\\"Metropolis\\" is one of the great early films, as the ton of material written about it attests. The transfer presented on Kino is extremely crisp and is made from the best sources. There are wonderfully informative extras: one can tell Kino was trying to do its usually excellent best. However, the projection speed is absurdly fast: I must agree with others who have pointed this out. It is true that certain movements are intended to be \\"jerky,\\" but that is irrelevant to the actual *speed*. People just move much too quickly throughout; it is simply inaccurate and detracts strongly from the film's mood and pace. Kino's own running time is listed as 124 minutes, and it is only 118 including the restoration credits. It may be that something was lost in translation to NTSC from the European standard, but even if that is the case, a 6-minute difference would not account for a film sped up this much. A big diappointment. Kino should redo it. Projection speed has never been a problem in Kino's wonderful transfers: \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\\" \\"Nosferatu,\\" \\"The Golem.\\" It's a shame that it ruins something as important as \\"Metropolis.\\"
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|Just Brings Back Memories <br />The most you'll enjoy this film is having invested a month of your life to the game. Then at best it may stir up old memories, your favourite characters, the fantastic scores of music, and then you'll feel warm inside. Then again, you could always just play the game. <br /> <br />The Music <br />As with alot of japanese movies they like their electric guitars. So for them to make something old and familiar (the music) sound fresh and more lively they rock it all up with electric guitars which loses its 'fresh' appeal within a minute or two. I'd go with the full blown orchestra every time, with a little less lead guitar pushing all the original music out of the frame. It would have been a welcomed surprize if there was a lead acoutic instrument and harps are always nice. <br /> <br />Plot and Characters <br />Because of what fans already know, there is little character development. This wouldn't matter so much, apart from the fact that there's very little emotion in the whole film to add to character. No one fears for Clouds life in the final battle, no one sheds one tear of worry. Maybe its becuase they all know who won the fight last time so why bother worry.  <br />   Becuase of the pace of the story all the characters appear in the film for a fight. The closest you see them all bond is when each character (yup everyone) gives Cloud a foot-boost to chase a Creature that can fly. There's very little dialogue between them. I would have loved for the characters to have human problems the viewer could relate to and then emphasise with but there are none, unless you have a super rear case of geo-stigma. <br /> <br />Humour? <br />The only humour element in the whole of the film is acted out by the two Turks in suits. This is screwball tomfoolery comedy at best, hitting each other by mistake etc and nothing more. Its funny the first time. Personally I also thought the turks were the coolest bunch of cats in the whole of FFVII and so I wasn't happy to see these guys turned into Abbot and Castelo, albeit a very cool looking Abbot and Castelo. <br /> <br />The Directors Vision <br />The film was made to appear well... not real <br /> <br />If the creators focused on making a proper movie with real life sensibilities I would have enjoyed the film more. Then again they did say (in the extras) they wanted to make a film that looked like a game not real life. This in turn meant people could jump... (they made their own rules) well you could almost call it flying... all over the place. But then when someone would slip over any edge of some tall structure, about to fall to their demise, the ability to jump/fly is lost and well down they fall. <br />   The plot was a message being left for Cloud and him reciveing it at the end of the film (from the directors mouth). Lots of fights are crammed in the middle of the plot. I found the fights far too fast, being as long as they are made for an exhausted viewing. <br /> <br />It's pretty. <br />Good Japanese Voices. <br />Average music - typical constant Jap metal guitar solos ruin any faithful representation of the original music. <br /> <br />Sorry but there were way too many fan reviews of this DVD, I couldn't find a single one review meriting the film for being exactly that 'a film.' As it is... \\"This beautiful film offers no more than skin deep sentimentality for fans of FFVII\\" Fans will be happy to own anything that has been branded with the FFVII name. I'm a fan too, but an extreamly picky one at best. <br /> <br />Sorry if anyones feelings were hurt, no one else was writing the side of the story but its now here.
0143036556|4.0|Although I don't agree with the conclusions drawn by Mr. Diamond (is that his real name?), I nevertheless really enjoyed reading this book.  He does an fine job of pulling together various historical societies and delving in to how they collapsed.  From a historical perspective, this should be a 5 star review.  However, there are some flaws: <br /> <br />1.  Mr. Diamond loves to speak with total authority.  While I will admit that he does come across as an authority figure, he is often very adamant regarding facts that are impossible to prove.  While I appreciate his analytical skill and feel that he is probably correct a lot, he would benefit from a little more modesty.  As a result, the reader must be careful to realize that much of what he presents as a factual conclusion may in fact only be his best educated guess. <br /> <br />2.  While he does a great job bringing facts together, he often seems to pick and chose the facts that will best promote his forgone conclusions.  For example, he uses Rawanda and its ethic carnage to make a point against overpopulation (one of his pet issues), since the size of the average farm was less than 1 acre (due to fathers splitting the land between many sons) in 1993.  However, it seems to me that the problem was not that there was overpopulation, the real issue was the lack of productivity of the populace.  For example, in the US, we have a few huge farms and the rest of us do something other than farm.  Therefore, most of us aren't concerned about killing each other to inherit that extra acre of farmland.  Mr. Diamond doesn't even pursue that possibility. <br /> <br />3.  Late in the book, Mr. Diamond begins presenting lessons for us, gleaned by him from the failed societies.  Again, he only focuses on the items that fit his agenda, and overlooks information that doesn't conform.  Unfortunately, this very nearly knocks this book into the political realm, instead of allowing us to view it as a tremendous historical review.  Forexample, on page 491 he mentions a 1986 study that estimated that humans were already using or wasting about 1/2 of the Earth's photosynthic capacity(!!!).  This would be a big deal, as it implies that our future food and timber options are very limited (let's ignore the fact that crop yields have continued to soar since 1986).  Yet Mr. Diamond treats this as a fact, and lists this as one of the obstacles our society must overcome.  And, he doesn't give a footnote or even name the study! <br /> <br />I hate to seem negative on the book, because it is an impressive work in many ways and I really wanted to give it 5 stars based on the historical information presented.  Unfortunately, given the weaknesses listed, I may be a little too generous with 4 stars. <br /> <br />Still, if you want to learn more about many societies that collapsed, then this book is for you.  It's easy to read and to become caught up in.  Just guard against falling for every conclusion and \\"fact\\" he throws at you, and you'll be OK.
0446677450|5.0|If you have never invested before or have begun to think about investing then you should read this book. Even if you already invest this book will make you change the way you think about how you plan for your future financially. A must read!
B000E6UWE4|1.0|I enjoy fantasy epics as much as any other geek. But this one didn't work for me -- enough so that I set the book aside, and I put it on the \\"donate to the library\\" pile.<br /><br />This book has way too many characters for my liking, and none of them is strong enough to make me care about his individual fate... but when a tale is well-told, I don't mind (or notice) that.<br /><br />However, the real weakness is that the characters are (at least to start with) described with too much reliance on labels. For instance, an old woman (who is also a Seer and apparently a witch) is described as a hag, and the author depends on that stereotype to carry our image of that character. A better book would have described her as an old woman (with her own set of personal attributes), and not relied on words like \\"hag\\" or \\"crone\\" to get the point across. It's not exactly that these are stick figures, but perhaps that they're scarecrows: stick figures with enough clothes hung on them to make them appear -- but not be -- real. At least to this reader.<br /><br />Based on other reviews here, my view is in the minority. Perhaps it would grow on me if I kept reading. However, I found that I couldn't escape into this book, and I gave up after 50 pages.
B000002ADT|5.0|i hear that there are people who live without this album. i don't know how they do it.
1400032717|5.0|I would like to start my review out by saying this was a great book.  It was about a autistic kid named Christopher that always tryed to reach his goals.  He had struggles with his social interactions, with his father, Mrs. Alexander, Mr. sears, and his mother.  He did not like to socialize with many people at all.  He had a counselor named Siobhan who helped him calm down, and told him what to look for in life.  Christopher found out that Whellington the dog down the street was killed by a garden fork.  That hurt christopher badly, so he did some detective work to find out who did it.  Later on Christopher's dad found out that Christopher was doing some detective work and he took his journal.  When Christopher went looking for his journal in his father's room he found letters from his mother, and found out that she was still alive. I will let you decipher what happens for the rest of the story.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Kinji Fukasaku's 2000 film \\"Battle Royale\\" has attracted fans from all over the world with its controversy and ultraviolence. Set in an alternate reality, a ninth grade class is outfitted with weapons and food for a few days, let loose on an evacuated island, and forced to kill one another until only one is left standing. Electronic collars around their necks keep track of their movements and ensure that the \\"players\\" don't do anything suspicious. The forty-two students involved in the game face a great dilemma: what do you do? Which friends can you trust, if any? Do you run and hide, commit suicide, find your friends and hope for the best, or... play the game? With danger and death looming around every corner, these students must make decisions that reflect their character, decisions that ultimately decide their fate. <br /> <br />The movie itself is totally unlike anything you'll see coming from the United States. The adolescent violence is a constant theme, never allowing the viewer to breathe for too long. Touching exchanges between the ill-fated characters provide a strong dramatic element to go along with the action. And, believe it or not, there is some great black humor thrown in to boot. Though not for the faint of heart, Battle Royale is an incredible tale of will and survival, and it challenges its viewers to think about what they would do in a similar situation. <br /> <br />Notable for his acting is the great Takeshi Kitano, who plays the students' former teacher and runs the Battle Royale program this time around. Tatsuya Fujiwara (Nanahara) and Aki Maeda (Noriko) are the main characters, and most of the action revolves around them and what they see. Taro Yamamoto (Kawada) plays a mysterious \\"transfer\\" into the class, and his motives are unknown to the others. Chiaki Kuriyama (Chigusa) of Kill Bill fame catches the eye of more than one student, and shows that she can do far more than swing a ball and chain. Kou Shibasaki (Mitsuko) and Masanobu Ando (Kiriyama) round out the main cast as two wild students who aim to mow down everyone in their path. <br /> <br />The DVD is a special version of the original film, with about eight additional minutes of footage involved. These extra scenes add some backstory to many of the characters and highlight what life was like before they were chosen for the game. Recurring scenes of a basketball game show the unity of the class - a stark contrast to what the rules of the game suggest, and what they force these kids to do. There are also some additional shots of the students' reactions. The action is digitally enhanced, with the gunshots sounding louder and the blood splattering further than in the original version. <br /> <br />The special features, absent in the original DVD release of the film, show that the actors and actresses really are just kids. Most of the features show them having a good time and enjoying themselves on set. Some promotional material and short interviews with the cast and director are included as well. Not all of the special features are subtitled in English, but the subtitles that are used are top-notch, especially in the feature film. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great disc to pick up if you've never heard of Battle Royale - or even if you have.
B000B5XZLU|3.0|hey! I am a REAL jamirogirl - i love jamiroquai through and through lol i have all there albums an evn met JK!!! As a fan I was basically obliged to buy dynamite. However I found it really disappointing, compared to their other stuff - i mean you can't compare dynamite to the return of the space cowboy or emergency... Jamioquai's new stuff has completley lost it's original, rich funky sound - i mean Fells.. that was so un-jamiroquai. I really wud not reccomend ne1 but this but who am I 2 say - U may like it :) therefore yh try it out I gess. A funk Oddesy was where Jamiroquai were goin off course but dynamite was not jamiroquai like at all apart from the track starchild i gess. Nothing compared to return of the space cowboy! lol cyaaa
1400079179|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. So much suspense that I had a hard time putting it down. And to all the people who gave it one star, I hate to break it to you, but this isn't a college textbook on religion. It's fiction!!! Helloooooo!
0399226907|5.0|One of the most fascinating books for my children (2 and 4) and has been for several years. The fascination is on all levels and we have managed to grow and develop the theme over the years.<br /><br />Firstly when they were very young the food illustrations were great fun for them - and the holes in the pages where the caterpillar had 'eaten' through, were also great fun - they would look back and forth from one side to the other.<br /><br />You can use the items to count up, quite basic, but a great learning tool for pre schoolers and for basic addition.<br /><br />We have started raising monarch butterflies and this story has been a great basic primer for the life cycle. We watch Monarchs lay their eggs, although we have never seen a caterpillar hatch(yet) we have watched them right through growing, forming the chrysalis and hatching into a butterfly - it is such a good book to use as an easy and fun reference for early understanding of the cycle - and then showing them that it actually happens.<br /><br />I love the illustrations. My only quibble is the butterfly at the end, well the wings seem to be upside down - the smallest wings are at the top of the butterfly, not the bottom. A small issue not really anything much - the rest of the book is so beautiful - I have other Eric Carle books, including a wonderful one on the cricket in a board book. I would recommend them for early primers - bright, bold colours and shapes, with lots to look at and lots to do in them.
B000025XKM|5.0|i've heard well over 7,000 albums in my days here on earth, and this is a member of my favorite dozen. i have a whole arsenal of adjectives polished & ready to go here, but words really cannot capture what makes this album so special. the sound of it all is just shot through with magic, sculpted in a musical language that escapes the written word. these are about the greatest folk melodies ever, a gift to the world from a troubled young man touched by a singular muse. the whole album plays out in under 30 minutes. stark and spare. gorgeous as it gets, mr drake's unique guitar style is captured in astonishing vividness on this bare bones production. the piece titled \\"horn,\\" which is only one minute and nineteen seconds long, is as haunting a musical composition as i have ever experienced. a minimalist gathering of single notes that have a soul-wrenching impact. really can't be described. just pure feeling. unique and perfect. \\"pink moon,\\" \\"which will,\\" \\"from the morning,\\" songcraft at its finest. \\"radio\\" has guitar work that is astonishing. i could go on and on about this thing. few pieces of art have ever had such impact on my soul. don't miss this tremendous outpouring of creative genius. <br /> <br />
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|A long-time fan of FFVII myself, I love Advent Children and the quality of the film, I still believe SquareEnix to be THE best cinematic makers in the gaming business. I love the extras that the 2 disc comes with but there is something people don't know.<br /><br />The japanese version 2 disc special edition has something that any fan of FF would love to have, it has the short animated film of Final Fantasy VII: Lost Order plus other extras like commentary and such.<br /><br />I feel the U.S market is being shafted a little because of this extras that don't come with ours and I don't like that at all. I feel that the animated film should have been included in the special edition.<br /><br />I'm pro for this movie, definitly, but I am disappointed in the marketing/publishing companies who took away the rest of our extras.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Wow,I just cant believe that anyone could like this horrible band.The lead singer Billy joe is terrible and sings horribly and they sound more like a boy band.Boluevard of broken dreams and wake me when september ends must surely be the worst songs ever made and this album is as bad as warning.Ignore the five star reviews and stay away from cd's by Nirvana,Green day who are trash and only meant for babies.
B000002GBB|5.0|Simply put, tracks 7, 8, and 9 -- Queen of Spades, Renegade, and Pieces of Eight, repectively -- are all strong rockers, very lyrical, and very worth the price of this album.
B000CBO04E|1.0|The artwork is okay, although blurry in places. Okay the compliments are out of the way. I love this album, but this is the worst sounding edition I have ever heard. It was clearly mastered from the muddy U.S. version, but compressed so much that it distorts all over the place. The review before mine must be from someone who works for the company that releases this, because one would have to be deaf in order to NOT hear the disorted overly compressed madness that this CD presents to the listener.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|You hear this phrase all the time. The movie Lord of War starring Nicolas Cage is a first person narative depicting the life of an arms dealer, a person who sells after-war weaponry.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of this film is that its a first person narative, as if we're directly in the mind of the main character. The story unfolds from a present time to retrospective view, from the first scene to his comment, than a flash back, returning to him once again, finishing his comment.<br /><br />The story takes place during the Cold War, where his family adopts a Jewish name to escape Russian tyranny. His family makes ends meat by working at a family restuarant. He shows the audience how living in his neighborhood, there was constant gang warfare and how his one defining moment that shaped his future in arms dealing, was 2 seconds from getting shot. He realized and commented how a certain commodity was always needed... guns.<br /><br />Personally, I liked watching this movie because its something many people are not aware of until Hollywood shows us its or been happening. It too portrays both sides of morality, where his wife \\"defends\\" humanity while Nicolas seems indifferent towards the use of his sold weaponry. I find Nicolas's comment when aruging with his wife, \\"I cant stop, because Im good at it\\" or something close to it, was very intriguing as I thought about the implications of that comment, where just because we're good at it and it results in deaths, do we continue?
B000002KAT|5.0|i first heard this in 1978. at first i didn't get what all the fuss was about. one year later, maybe five listens later & i realized that i was stupid & that this really is a timeless classic. 26 years later it is one of my ten most listened to albums. you can't live without this. take my word for it. you really can't. if you don't have this & you think you're living, you're wrong. oh so wrong.
B00005RZV4|5.0|Being just about the biggest NIN fan in the area that I live in, I own both the DVD AND the CD version of And All That Could've Been. As I said in my review for the DVD, Trent's songs are a lot better performed lie. Terrible Lie has a lot more energy live than it did on Pretty Hate Machine (don't get me wrong, the original is great, but the live version is even better), as do Sin and Head Like A Hole. There's just something about how raw and powerful Trent's voice is that makes NIN's concert's spectacular. The audience doesn't drown out the music, which is always good to know; and they know when to keep quiet during softer and more melodic songs like The Great Below, The Mark Has Been Made, The Frail, The Day The World Went Away, and Hurt. Trent also extends a few of the songs, like Sin, March of the Pigs, Starf***ers Inc, and more. He also adds a few extra words in songs, like in The Wretched where Trent chants \\"there is a place... in the back of my mind... where I used to try... try\\" during the interlude with the jumpy keyboard.<br /><br />While this isn't the entire concert, the live album has a song that wasn't included on the DVD. I.E. The Day The World Went Away (which, in my opinion, isn't one of the better tracks off The Fragile). The DVD has La Mer, Complication, and Just Like You Imagined. My reccomendation is that you buy both, just so you can listen to the record in your car or on your ipod when your walking home from school (that's what I did) and buy the DVD so you can hear the extra songs and watch Trent's antics on stage.<br /><br />Highly reccomended from a big NIN fan!
B000EULJLU|5.0|There are many reasons why i think this is an incredible album.  It is obvious that this, Tool's sixth major release, is a continuation of their ongoing legacy.  This album is very angry, but so peacful that its almost hard to tell how pissed they are. <br />        Songs like \\"Wings for marie\\" and \\"10.000 Days\\" are flowing and melodic, while speaking a message of maturity and disgust for the world's current religious situation.  Religion has always been heavily layered into their music, but more so here. <br />        Tool still hfinds time to show their anger out right.  \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Jambi\\" are alitle more metal and angst ridden, while \\"intention\\" is an affirmation of a level of peace the band has never seen. <br />        This is just the natural progression of a great band that has the power to change lives and open eyes, even the eyes you never knew you had.  Keep up the good work guys, and thank you for one incredible album after another.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Double albums are tricky business. Sometimes they're over-conceptualized - though excellent musically, Pink Floyd's The Wall tries to stick to a common theme and doesn't always succeed. And sometimes they're weighed down with filler - The Smashing Pumpkins' Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness has way too much top-notch material for one CD but not quite enough for two. <br /> <br />Yet the Red Hot Chili Peppers' new Stadium Arcadium walks the line well. Dividing their material into \\"Jupiter\\" and \\"Mars\\" discs (which seems to mean nothing in terms of stylistic differences), singer Anthony Kiedis, guitarist John Frusciante and rhythm section Flea and Chad Smith deliver two full hours of carefree pop-rock bliss. <br /> <br />Several of the tracks, including \\"Charlie,\\" \\"Hump de Bump,\\" \\"Tell me Baby\\" and \\"Readymade,\\" bring back the harder-edged funk-rap sound of BloodSugarSexMagik. Interestingly, the aggressive verses tend to lead into melodic choruses, giving these songs more variety than traditional funk tunes have. <br /> <br />Other compositions, like first single \\"Dani California,\\" uber-standout track \\"Especially in Michigan\\" and soothing ballad \\"If,\\" continue Californication and By the Way's excursion into Beatles-influenced upbeat melody. Though these songs occasionally lack the negative energy that popped up from time to time on older material (no one dies on a mountain, gets his throat slit or cuts his wrists \\"Under the Bridge\\" on Stadium Arcadium), the lyrics keep away from cheesy territory. <br /> <br />Amazingly, listeners won't be inclined to skip a single track, making Stadium Arcadium one of the most consistent two-CD sets in history. But that's not to say it's perfect. <br /> <br />For one, there are a lot of laid back, melodic songs, each with its own melody and guitar riffs. Unfortunately, because the record is so long and leans so heavily in this direction, many of the tracks sound alike for the first few listens. Fans could avoid this pitfall by onlylistening to one CD until it becomes familiar. <br /> <br />Also, though many of the lyrics are insightful or at least comprehensible, oftentimes they're little more than gibberish. In \\"Charlie,\\" for example, Kiedis belts out, \\"Everybody do the twist / Get the message on Flea's fist / Move around like a scientist / Lay down, get kissed.\\"  <br /> <br />Then, in \\"Storm in a Teacup,\\" there's \\"You try to be a lady / But you're walkin' like a sour kraut [sic].\\" Google informs us \\"kraut\\" can be a derogatory term for a German person, but maybe it's a typo and Kiedis really is accusing a woman of moving like cabbage. <br /> <br />While a bit much to handle at once, the 28 songs on Stadium Arcadium are catchy, well written and worth repeated listens. They continue a trend: Since the 1999 comeback Californication, the Red Hot Chili Peppers have pleasantly surprised listeners with each release. At this rate, they'll soon be worthy of the \\"classic rock\\" moniker.
0765315246|3.0|There are times when you need to do something strictly for fun, but you want more mental involvement than television will give you.  \\"Old Man's War\\" is a pleasant diversion and an entertaining piece of space opera, but it isn't anything you haven't seen before. <br /> <br />First, it has much in common with military recruiting stories like \\"Starship Troopers\\" or the movie \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" et.al.  Rather than pulling you into a plot-driven storyline, the novel depends on military basic training to establish the characters.  \\"Old Man's War\\" spends perhaps half of the novel getting to the \\"War\\" part. <br /> <br />The charm of \\"Old Man's War\\" is in its acknowledgment that races humanity might meet if it traveled the stars would be nothing like us -- would in fact sometimes be nearly incomprehensible.  In addition, Scalzi manages to use various military and sci-fi conventions without seeming too much like a copycat.  The novel would be a good bridge for readers of military fiction to sci-fi and it is appealing as a \\"space opera.\\" <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I found most of the characters, including the main character, shallowly drawn.  However, the novel engaged my attention enough to be mildly satisfying at the end.
1594200823|5.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is part a chronicle of Pollan's trip up and down various food chains as well as an informative account of how food is brought to your table.  There are several eye-opening facts presented in 'The Omnivore's Dilemma'...things that most of us never really think about, such as: the amount of energy expended to bring a meal to your table (or car), or that 'if we are what we eat, we're basically a corn chip with arms and legs.'<br /><br />The section on 'Big Organic' was a lesson on how the purest of ideas can be corrupted by the quest for the almighty dollar and the introduction of industrial methods.  It illustrates how the term organic has become a commodity in and of itself and how the word really means little, especially when these products are caught up in the large food supply chain of a Whole Foods.<br /><br />The most fascinating section of the book was the discourse on the farming methods and philosophy of Joel Saletan.  Saletan proves that his concept of 'beyond organic' is both profitable and sustainable.  It's a fascinating story, and one that offers hope and a true alternative.<br /><br />Many books of this nature are all doom and gloom.  Although Pollan presents some disturbing facts, the alternatives presented (such as the example of Saletan's Polyface Farm) make this book worthwhile.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|HIGHLY recommend N&S!!    I have seen TONS of bbc period miniseries and the only one I would consider better (by a hair) is the colin firth pride and prejudice.    N&S is a darker series (sets and costumes) as it takes place in an industrial city.  I will admit that much of it is predictable but I loved it anyway.     BTW - I have not read the book.
0385484518|5.0|As I had to read this book for a class assignment it turned out to be relevant and very inspirational for my life. This collection of life lessons has something for everyone of all ages. It is written so it can easily be understood by anyone. One would definitely take something away after reading it.
0307277674|4.0|I wanted to read this book because of all the hype; but couldn't get through the trenches of the writing.  After the first 8 chapters (they are pretty short) the book was too confusing.  Flash backs, flash forwards...I felt inundated.  I finally had to see the movie to understand the book.  Now I will go back and read the book with the baseline of what the story is all about.<br /><br />However, I applaud Dan for his creativity.  Taking a subject such as religion, where we all absolutely know the religious story of \\"Easter\\" from childhood and other stories of Christianity and here comes the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" metaphorically pulling the rug from under our feet is pretty genius. Good going Dan, but next time...easy on the pen...
0064430227|5.0|This book will inspire creativity and imagination. Sweet stories and cute drawings, I love the concept of Harold drawing his own adventures. My daugher started loving this at about 1.5 and still wants to read it a year later, I don't see it getting old for several years to come.
0307263118|3.0|_The Sea_ is a beautifully written book, but one that ultimately left me cold.  It follows the narrative of Max Morden, who returns to the seaside resort where he spent many childhood summers after his wife dies of cancer.  As he descends further and further into isolation and alcoholism, he ponders his wife's recent death of cancer (and the way she often seemed to reject what comfort he had to offer toward the end) and a childhood tragedy, the exact nature of which we only learn at the end of the book.  Some time is also devoted to his rather unsatisfactory relationship with his daughter Claire, toward whom he is sometimes surprisingly emotionally cruel (e.g., making unkind comments about her single state, blaming her for not being more present during her mother's illness even though the circumstances were somewhat beyond her control) and his relationship with the other boarder in the house and the proprietress. <br /> <br />Since this novel follows the inner story of a man who ultimately seems to be evaluating his own perceived failures, on some level, it is slightly reminiscent of Kazuo Ishiguro's _The Remains of the Day_, but it is nowhere near as compelling.  Whereas the reader of _The Remains of the Day_ cannot help but pity Stevens for his frustrating emotional blindness and his all-too-late realization of what he has missed in life, Max Morden is too self-satisfied to be particularly compelling; he recognizes his weaknesses, to be sure, but you don't get the feeling that they wound him to core.  And there is no particularly compelling epiphany in this book, in my view.  <br /> <br />I was also a little bothered by the stuffiness of Max's inner voice, and by his only partially explained meteoric rise in class position.  His wife's family had money, to be sure, but her father was an underworld type figure, and Max himself was from a working-class background.  How in the world does Max wind up as an upper-middle class elite writing a scholarly book on Bonnard?Do writers always have to write about writers? <br /> <br />In short, while I certainly admire Banville's writing style, I did not find myself particularly caught up in the tale being told, and I can't imagine this is a book I will return to again and again.
B00003CXB7|5.0|this is still one of the funnest movies i have ever seen. if you have never seen the movie ,only the t.v. show then you are in for a treat,the movie is really just scenes strung together and that is part of the fun. donald sutherland is a hawkeye you never knew, elliott gould is trapper john and in a part not done on t.v.tom skerritt is duke and the whole cast is great. so if you have only seen the show get ready for some eye opening comedy.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I was in love on first listen. Vicarious starts doing tool the way that no-one else can, and even tool probably couldn't before this release. Off-jointed rythems and lurching riffs pull the song to a technical climax after a typical build up. As the song ends on a toolesque cliche that I can't really identify (tool, when they use cliches, instead of becoming one, show us that it is possible to make better music through what was trite until now), my adrenaline is pumping, and jambi stops it in its tracks. As it drones, I lay back, slightly dissapointed, and don't really pay attention again until the guitar solo. I wasn't all too impressed with this song, at first. Then, on comes wings for marie. Carey brushing the drums in a unique way, anticipation, and then creepy guitars a la ripe with decay from NIN's the fragile come in and decelerate, boooooommm the bass guitar rings, and Maynard comes in with some heavy effects on his voice making him sound like a buddhist choir. Goosebumps alight my skin, and I am raptured throughout the entire song. By the time it ends, I am convinced that it is the most beautiful song ever recorded, and anyone who says it is boring is a dumb idiot. 10,000 days follows the same thread, and is also very beautiful, although not as good, it is still an absolute masterpeice. Then, the pot comes on. What the heck? I am disgusted by the way they follow up such beautiful songs. lipan conjuring, okay I suppose. The Hoffman lost keys song gets me wondering if this is a concept album, and then rossetta stoned is really cool, but I phase out after the beginning, and am sort of half listening through the rest of the album, because they gave me plenty to think about.    After that, this album grew and grew on me. I listened to it obsessively, and I can conclude that this album is easily just as good as lateralus, and even better at its best moments. I listen to tons of obscure music, and I could probably still fit both this album and lateralus in my topten. I urge everyone to listen to it a ton and let it creep up on you. This is tools most mature and haunting release. If you can't appreciate beauty and would rather rock your brains out, then stick 1,5,&10 on the end of aenima or something. Or just don't buy it. I would go so far as to reccommend this album to fans of classical music and or jazz, because it easily stands up to it. Tool is neoclassicalism as metal music. Reqeuim by Mozart reminds me of 3 and 4 in its emotional impact.      On a side note, apparently, 3,4, and 11 go together by putting 3 and 11 together, and then playing it at the same time as 4. it makes an uber 10,000 days.
0688170528|5.0|Emily Gold and Chris Harte are high school sweethearts who are also next-door neighbors.  Their parents are best friends and the teenagers have been together since they were born.  In their senior year Chris looks forward to college, but a traumatic incident from Emily's early life puts her into a tailspin, and she confides in Chris that she is suicidal.  He tries to disuade her, but she insists that she will kill herself.  In the opening scene of the book a gun goes off and Emily is killed, but there is some question as to who pulled the trigger.  Chris is arrested and spends 7 months in prison, waiting for his trial.  The rest of the story is told in flashbacks which are interspersed with what is happening currently to the characters.  Picoult is at her best as she creates characters with wonderful depth and builds suspense which spins her story to a fascinating conclusion.
B000031XCR|1.0|I first heard this cd when my wife wasted my hard earned money on it. Needless to say her allowance is now in permanent moritoriam. The assault on my ears by this pompous, self indulgent windbag was enough to send me to the liquor store for a case of Bourbon in hopes to drink it's memory out of me. This cd is perfect if you want to punish the ones you love. I wish I could give it zero stars but I guess when it can be used as a weapon it deserves at least one.  <br />A true weapon of mass destruction.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|robert duvall and tommy lee jones star in this fantastic and landmark western that is the benchmark for all western movies that have come after it. based on the prize winning novel this story of a cattle drive to montana is so much more than what it sounds like. this is the great american western told as it must have really been. nothing you have ever seen will get you ready for this slice of western life. the best ever put out on t.v.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Many stand out tracks, very strong cd, Favorites are U and Ur hand and Fingers. Stupid girls isnt the best song, and doesn't really resemble much of the cd... but I guess it got people's attention. Good thing this came out before her career really died :P
B000F4RHB6|4.0|There are often times where I absolutely wonder why so many acts today like Britney Spears, Usher and Beyonce', seem to be more about the image over the music. It is definitely a sad case. That is why I would rather prefer listening to guilty pleasures of the past, because the music was a bit more organic back in the 80's. One of my favorites of course that still sticks in my head is Huey Lewis & The News. Since their 80's days, they have been gone but definitely not forgotten within their music and the appeal of a great song. They have also had a mostly good greatest hits record a decade ago with Time Flies in 1996, but that collection could've had more to offer. Now another record might take its place as a really better greatest hits record.<br /><br />Huey Lewis & The News 2006 Greatest Hits record is a bit more than what the previously hits had to offer. The compilation does really showcase what made this 80's group had definitely delivered, great music and good appeal with pop, soul & R&B. The compilation is restored and remastered very well and includes a lot of the groups biggest 80's hits like I Want A New Drug, Heart And Soul, If This Is It, the #1 Back To The Future Track The Power Of Love, the bluesy Workin' For A Livin'. The album also adds on very well by including tracks surprisingly overlooked from the last greatest hits record like the upbeat Hip To Be Square, Jacob's Ladder and Perfect World. The album also delivers Huey's duet with Gwenyth Paltrow on the Smokey Robinson cover of Crusin'. Although the album overlooks a few minor tracks like Bad Is Bad, the collection is purely definitive.<br /><br />All in all, there have been very few good records out there right now, but Huey Lewis & The News Greatest Hits is a definite buy for die hard fans of this 80's gem, or for anybody who hasn't heard the original heart of rock and roll. I absolutely suggest this record.<br /><br />Album Cover: A-<br /><br />Songs: A-<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: A<br /><br />Overall: B+r />Remastering: A <br /> <br />Overall: B+
0385512104|5.0|The curious incident of the dog in the night time is about a young man named Christopher,who is autistic, and his daily struggle with social interactions with his father, mrs. alexander, mr. sears, and his mother. Siobhan, his counselor, urges him to write a book so this story is formatted in a journal that he has comprised through his detective work in solving the case of who killed wellington(mrs shears dog). This story was very interesting and can keep you on the edge of your seat. At times it's funny, sad, and exciting subsequently making it an all around pleasant book to read.
076790592X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It gave me some insight to what life is really about.  And I enjoyed both Mitch and Morrie's character.  Morrie is some one I would truly like to meet.  He so wise, loving and truly knows what life is about.  The discussions he has with Mitch I truly take to heart.  I think this is a book that every one should read because it makes you reflect on your life and what is truly important to you.  And if you decide to read this book I encourage you too read it at the begining of your day.  It will remind you about what is important in life.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Finally!<br /><br />Following in the steps of recent `Greatest Hits' offerings by Pat Benatar (2005), J. Geils Band (2006) and Poison (2006), Capitol Records finally issues a more up-to-date hits collection from the guys from San Francisco.  After the disappointing 1996 `Best Of' issue many fans were hoping for a more complete single disc retrospective.  Finally, it's here!<br /><br />While this release has it's flaws it is simply the best single disc Huey Lewis & The News offering on the market today.  Nearly every track has received a stunning remastering treatment by Robert Vosgien at Capitol Mastering Studios, Hollywood.  This guy has done a brilliant job with these recordings!  Never have these songs sounded so clear and full!  I'm so excited to be able to listen to these songs for the first time in this new upgraded sound.  Check out \\"Hip To Be Square\\"!  This song has never had so much kick!  The remastering alone makes this compilation worth owning!  It sounds much better than the 1996 hits offering.<br /><br />On a side note, the liner notes state that only tracks 1-13, 16, 17, & 19-21 were remastered.  That means tracks 14 (\\"It's Alright\\"), 15 (\\"Cruisin'\\"), and 18 (\\"But It's Alright\\") were not remastered by Robert.  This is fine, considering the \\"Cruisin'\\" track is from 2000, not really in need of a remaster.  \\"It's Alright\\" from 1993 is an a cappella track, so any audio upgrades are probably hard to hear.  Nonetheless, \\"But It's Alright\\" from 1994 has been upgraded as well.  The sound is an obvious improvement over the '94 release.<br /><br />Capitol was quite generous with this release, including a total of 21 Huey Lewis & The News hits, ranging from their very first Top Ten smash - 1982's \\"Do You Believe In Love\\" - to Huey's #1 Adult Contemporary smash from 'Duets' - 2000's \\"Cruisin\\" (with Gwyneth Paltrow).  I was most excited to see the latter track make an appearance here.  The real treat, however, is to finally have a remastered \\"Back In Time\\" on CD format.  (I have been waiting for this one for a few years now!)  The somewhat rare track, which was featured in the movie `Back To The Future' and left off the `96 compilation, makes a much-anticipated appearance here.  Additionally, \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" - a #1 single in early `87 - gets a spot here.  Also, making appearances now are hits such as \\"Hip To Be Square\\" (#3 in `86), \\"Perfect World\\" (#3 in '88), and \\"But It's Alright\\" (#54 in `94) -- all of which were missing from the `96 collection!<br /><br />The liner notes include recent commentary by Huey Lewis himself, Jimmy Kimmel, and Paul Libaratore.  Additionally, Billboard chart positions (Pop, Rock, AC) of the tracks and the albums from which they are pulled are included.  Several photos spanning the band, single sleeves, and album covers adorn the recording package.<br /><br />The problem with the `Time Flies' package is that the label tried shoving 4 new songs on a hits package.  It limited the amount of hits that could make the cut.  This new 2006 `Greatest Hits' fixes that problem for the most part.<br /><br />However, this release does have it's faults.  Missing tracks from the collection include \\"Walking On A Thin Line\\" (#18 in `84), \\"Give Me The Keys (And I'll Drive You Crazy)\\" (#47 in `89), \\"It Hit Me Like A Hammer\\" (#21 in `91), and \\"(She's) Some Kind Of Wonderful\\" (#44 in `94).  Also missing are any songs from the band's 1980 self-titled debut and 2000 'Plan B' release.  However, only so many songs can fit on a `Greatest Hits' 1-disc set, so I would imagine picking which songs to leave out would have been difficult.  The label, for the most part, decided to focus more so on the chart hits, and it works fine for this release.<br /><br />I considered knocking the compilation down a star for missing two Top 25 hits, but in the end the inclusion of several key tracks (i.e. \\"Back In Time\\" and \\"Cruisin'\\") and a generous 79 minutes of music make up for what's missing.  Top that with the stunning mastering job and it easily replaces the `Time Flies: The Best Of Huey Lewis & The News' disc.  Now it would be nice if we could get Capitol to issue a DVD companion - featuring their ENTIRE video history in remastered 5.1 sound - and a remastered reissue of the entire News' catalogue.

B00000729S|5.0|In Germany in the mid-60's, a group of American GI's decided to form a band called the Torquays to play the typical Chuck Berry and British Invasion-influenced music of the day, in some of the same Hamburg clubs that the Beatles ruled just a few years earlier. But then they got out of the Army, decided to stay in Germany, and something happened that completely fried their synapses, and then things got all wonderfully strange. They started to dress like monks and made music that sounded like a cross between a jet airplane and the German Wehrmacht storming across the Polish border. As a result, in 1966 the Monks left us with this stellar example of pure, adrenaline-filled caveman rock n' roll.  This is the kind of record that you're either gonna love it or hate it. No inbetweens. It's amazing how far ahead of its time this record was. I hear premonitions of everything from the Sex Pistols to Devo to Sonic Youth to Metallica in this record. Amazing, and created almost completely in a vacuum, nearly completely cut off from what was happening musically in Britain and America. Simply put, they sounded like nobody else of their time. If you love pure, loud as hell, primitive rock n' roll, then surely this album will cause involuntary headbanging or ass-shaking. The fact that there is somebody out there willing to save these guys from near obscurity and share it with the rest of us makes me glad to be alive.
B000003N8R|5.0|Collecting John Coltrane is a challenge; he was prolific, constantly evolving, and seemed to live in a recording studio.  Even so, certain landmark efforts have achieved \\"essential\\" status, for a variety of reasons.  I would agree that A Love Supreme, My Favorite Things, Ascension, African Brass, Giant Steps, and the Johnny Hartman collaboration all fall into this category.  Crescent does too, and I'm not certain why it is so frequently overlooked.<br /><br />Like A Love Supreme, Crescent is an integrated whole, not a mere collection of \\"tracks.\\"  The entire effort casts a very particular spell.  Maybe critics don't embrace it because it doesn't feature the trademark \\"sheets of sound\\" for which Coltrane was known, something akin to blowing the cold off of ice.  The allure of Crescent is much more subtle than that.<br /><br />Each selection, even the straight-ahead Bessie's Blues, aches with haunting, spiritual elegance.  The solos, which do occasionally soar, never lose sight of the ground and resolve back into their themes in deeply satisfying ways.  Coltrane's tone, always amazing, is especially lush and round here, almost opulent.  Even at its wiggliest you're unlikely to turn down the sound, this CD wants to soothe you, not nail you to the wall.<br /><br />The opening bars of the title track tell you exactly where you're about to go, straight into the sad and beautiful heart of truth.  Wise One takes listeners through the entire emotional cycle, fragile longing, seeking that reaches up, reconciliation.  Perfection.  McCoy Tyner shines throughout on piano, especially on Lonnie's Lament, a tune lovely enough to put tears in the eyes of a serial killer.  Drum Thing finds Elvin Jones conjuring up a sort of hypnotic trance; the interplay between him and Coltrane provides a transcendent conclusion to a CD of exquisite beauty.<br /><br />In many ways it's unfortunate that Coltrane's reputation rests on the idea of destroying music in order to reinvent it.  Listening to Crescent provides ample evidence that, in addition to being a profoundly spiritual man, Coltrane was as lyrical a player as has ever unpacked a horn.ence that, in addition to being a profoundly spiritual man, Coltrane was as lyrical a player as has ever unpacked a horn.

1400079179|1.0|I've spent twenty years working on witches and witch-hunting.  I am a professor at a well-known UK university.<br /><br />I have no comment to make on Brown's main claims, but I would like to assure everyone that neither the church nor anyone else made away with five million or any similar number of witches during the medieval and early modern periods.  The true figure over the entire period is somewhere between 30,000 and 100,000.  No serious historian now disputes this.  Of course this is still disturbing, but it simply isn't on the same scale.<br /><br />Moreover, witchhunting was NOT woman-hunting.  In some places a majority of those accused were men.  In others a majority of ACCUSERS were women; moreover midwives were NOT targeted for knowing about childbirth anaesthesia.  Far from it.  Many witnesses for the prosecution were midwives who often assisted trial judges in efforts to condemn witches by examining women suspects for witchmarks.<br /><br />The Malleus Maleficarum was not an especially influential text, and some inquisitors derided it as credulous hokum.<br /><br />If the absurd claims about witchcraft are samples of Brown's alleged deep research and historical truth-telling then I think we can conclude that the other claims are also called into question.  Only someone genuinely lazy could transcribe these discredited historical myths without bothering with the most elementary verification.  I wouldn't fuss, but the silly man keeps saying his book is all true.  This part of it isn't.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I have to say that for the most part Lindsay Lohan is smart...for she picks fun films that the whole family can enjoy, and within them she shows that she has acting chops to one day be a huge star (and by huge I mean award worthy, for she's already a HUGE star).  'Freaky Friday' is no exception (although Jamie Lee Curtis does steal the show here).  If your familiar with the original then you know the plot lines, mother and daughter don't get along, ever, and with a magic spell they switch bodies and are forced to live in each others shoes.  Each one feels the others life is so much easier than theirs but what they are soon to find out is that they really underestimate the other.  Whats so charming about this film is that nothing seems forced, the comedy the acting is all genuine.  When they switch theres no sign of their previous charactor, for Jamie Lee Curtis 'becomes' Lindsay Lohan and visa versa.  Put them in situations strange to them and hilarity ensues.  Great acting on all fronts, even by supporting charactors played by Chad Michael Murray & Mark Harmon who play the boy Anna (Lohan) is in love with and the man Tess (Curtis) is engaged to.  This is a great mother daughter film, but even moreso, a great family film that everyone can enjoy.
068981528X|5.0|This book hilarious!!!! It showed the pigs and the wolf switch roles, but in this version, each house was so strong, the pig just used a jackhammer or something of that nature. This book is full of irony, in that, the house made of flowers (the others were made of brick, cement, and steel) was the one that stumped the piig because the smell of flowers made him into a good pig and he befriended the wolves.
B0000793ZB|5.0|It is hard to imagine a better album from Simple Minds. Indeed, as another reviewer put it, the only other great song from the band not found in here is \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\". Still, the album is loaded with solid tracks, including the title track, \\"Alive and Kicking\\" and \\"Sanctify Yourself\\".<br /><br />With \\"Once Upon a Time\\", Simple Minds contributed to mold the sound of the eighties along with others like U2, Peter Gabriel, The Smiths and Tears For Fears. Indeed once upon a time, they used to make albums as good as this one.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril sounds a bit like Alanis, not just in the voice but also in the angst her songs are riddled with.  That sets her apart from the Vanessa Carlton's of the world and puts her in a catagory with more mature singers, and while she's still young and far from polished, she is off to a good start.  With her brilliant first single 'Complicated' Avril let the world know she was here and means business.  The song, as have some of her other efforts, have earned her the reputation of being 'a poser' but I say poser or not, her music's sounds pretty good.  Plus, most everybody in the music industry is a poser...you really think half of what these singers sing about they really experienced?  I mean how many rappers 'really' lived in the hood (Ja-Rule anyone) and how many rock stars really were abused as a child?  It happens to some, but not all.  Anyways, that said there are some really good songs here, most of which appear on the first half of the album (Losing Grip, Unwanted, Complicated, Mobil & I'm With You) that touch upon a variety of subjects (mostly concerning relationships though)  Anyways, this is a great debut album that held promise for Canadian rocker Avril, and she made good on that promise with her sophmore effort 'Under My Skin'.  Can't wait till number three.

They will be in widescreen but not 16:9 enhanced. Still, you need to buy these. If people boycott these we will never get these on DVD again. This is a limited edition because they don't really know how well this sale will do. If it does well I am sure they will be released again with all the bells and whistles but if people boycott these and don't buy them, they will not be released again! Get this to show Lucas that you care about the originals! Hey, at least the cover art is better.
B00005JOVN|4.0|When I first heard back in early 2004 that Wolfgang Petersen was planning a remake of \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" I was stoked. The 1972 film, starring Gene Hackman and Shelley Winters, holds a special place on my personal favorites list because it was the very first film my parents took me to see (at the local drive-in, no less). I was 6 years-old and what a flick! Imagine, at that age, watching a ship the size of the Queen Mary get struck by a rouge wave and turn upside down. It was amazing stuff!  <br /> <br />But while that film was considered a spectacle in its day (it was the top grossing film of 1973), the visuals have become dated and the performances are now labeled, fairly or unfairly, campy. Still, the Irwin Allen classic has become a guilty pleasure for loyal fans. Over the last several years many of those fans (myself included) have thought that, in the right hands, \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" would benefit from a remake. <br /> <br />And in Mr. Petersen the producers found the perfect filmmaker. How could Warner Bros go wrong with the brilliant, visionary director of the claustrophobic classic \\"Das Boot\\" and the brilliant \\"The Perfect Storm?\\" Combine the best elements of those two films with the classic tour-de-force survival story originally told by Paul Gallico in his 1969 novel and a new movie could become a critical and box office success. <br /> <br />So with much anticipation I headed to see \\"Poseidon\\" this past weekend. The long awaited remake is a tremendous spectacle that will keep you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire length of the movie. <br /> <br />The story is well known to just about everybody. During New Years Eve celebrations aboard the S.S. Poseidon, a monster rogue wave comes out of nowhere, slams into the luxury liner, capsizing her and leaving a few survivors, led by Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell, to try and find an escape from the upside down water trap. <br /> <br />Petersen begins the film with one of the most stunning opening shots in the history of film: A 3-minute wrap-around of the grand luxury liner as she sails the Atlantic. What makes this scene so amazing is the fact that the ship doesn't really exist. The Poseidon is completely computer generated, yet when you see her up on that screen you can only be in awe. She is majestic and stately - and puts a certain James Cameron luxury liner to shame. <br /> <br />We are then introduced to the main characters at a quick clip. Mark Protosevich's screenplay doesn't draw them very well, if at all. We learn very little about our travelers, and that misguided calculation bothers me. But, I'll speak to that in a moment. Because just as I was starting to let the lack of characterization bother me, the mighty Greek God of the Sea lashes out at our New Years revelers and spins their world upside down in a heart-pounding capsize sequence that bests the original's by a mile. <br /> <br />From there it's non-stop, edge-of-your-seat, hair-raising action as our rag tag group of survivors fight their way up the dying ship to find an escape, battling water and obstacles and more water along the way. Petersen's brilliant direction (assisted by Klaus Badelt's nerve-racking score) on three scenes in particular will have you climbing the walls.  <br /> <br />The first involves a scene in which Richard Dreyfuss' character is faced with one of the most gut-wrenching decisions a human being would ever have to make. I could feel the audience collectively asking themselves \\"God! What would I do?\\" The second involves the group's ascent through an air vent. The claustrophobia in this scene is so intense if you're not climbing the walls then you need to have your head examined. The third involves a mother (played by Jacinda Barrett) and her son (Jimmy Bennett) and the rising waters. Mothers will be ready to pull their hair out during this segment. <br /> <br />All of the action sequences are well done, but those three, spaced through out the movie, will leave you feeling exhausted...in a good way...as if it the cost of the ticket was money well spent. <br /> <br />As with most well done disaster movies it's the action sequences and special effects that save \\"Poseidon.\\" I recommend the movie highly and think that on my list of \\"popcorn flicks\\" this will join the original near the top. That is thanks in large part to Petersen, his computer and design crews, and a cast that did the best they could with the script they got. <br /> <br />And it is that script where I find my sole disappointment. Why Warner Bros moved ahead with such a lackluster screenplay puzzles me. This had the chance to be a classic sea tale. Don't get me wrong. I wasn't expecting \\"Moby Dick,\\" but Paul Gallico's \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" is the consummate story of survival at sea. It is deep in character study; human nature complete with all of its flaws. It is dark and psychological and leaves the reader breathless.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately none of that transferred over in the 1972 film. When I read that Wolfgang Petersen would be at the helm of this new version I had high hopes that the dramatic human stories told in the Gallico novel would finally be told on the big screen. But it doesn't happen. <br /> <br />Roger Ebert opined that he felt Petersen's heart wasn't in this film. I don't think that was it. To me it almost seems like Warner Bros wanted \\"Poseidon\\" in the can sooner rather than later and were willing to sacrifice a strong story in order to get the film on screens by May 12. As a result the film is awkwardly edited at times - as if there had been a script there, but that it was jettisoned and then a half-assed editing job done to plug the holes. It makes me wonder whether they purposefully threw away a potentially triumphant story for yet another piece of popcorn fluff. <br /> <br />At this point it doesn't really matter, because the film is popcorn fluff. Mind you, it is well done, exciting, and thrilling popcorn fluff and I highly suggestyou head to the theatre and give it a look. But, I just can't help but wonder \\"what if?\\" I'm afraid we'll never know, because it is highly doubtful that this story will be told again.

0792838068|1.0|I first saw this movie in the theater and at the time, I was fooled.  I had no experience with alcoholicism and no education about it.  I also had a fascination with prostitutes and so, you see, I was fooled by the two main characters.  I thought it was a really good movie.  <br /> <br />If I judge my life from the ages of 17-23 I think my opinion on the movie matches nicely with the stupid behavior and incorrect opinions with which it was contemporary.  In other words, I was wrong.  <br /> <br />Later in life I've learned a thing or two about alcohol and I've at least figured out that street walking prostitutes tend to be drug addicts and are not really very attractive at all, so I no longer have a naive attraction to the CONCEPT of either main character, and thus their false characterization is highly apparent.  ON which flawed foundation the rest of the move cannot stand.  So on re-watching the movie recently I was disgusted with its falseness and ridiculousness.  <br /> <br />Cage plays a man who is in such pain over the loss of his family and all that was good in his life that he wants to drink himself to death.  Here's a stupid contradiction for you: he wants to die so he drinks, whereas in real life, alcholics drink because they believe they need it to live.  As in, if you stop drinking you think you're going to die from the hardship/emotions/stress of it.   <br /> <br />If you want to commit suicide try jumping off a cliff.  It works faster and you can leave your booze money to charity.  Plus you might provide food for some animals.  There's your noble sacrifice to ease your infinite pain.  By comparison, the cliff method makes drinking yourself to death on expensive booze seem pretty selfish, neh?  <br /> <br />Shue plays a drop dead gorgeous streetwalking prostitute (here's your 2nd stupid contradiction).  She decides she loves the man who wants to die so bad that he drinks an insane amount.  She agrees not to try to save his life because she honors the nobility of his quest to die. (snerk)   <br /> <br />So we have a couple of completely unrealistic characters who then fall in 'love' and proceed to be miserable for a few weeks.  Problem is, when you have stupid unrealistic characters, their relationship simply _can_not_ be plausible either.   <br /> <br />Hollywood has a lot of people fooled into thinking that pain is beauty, and that contemptible behavior ostensibly motivated by that pain is honorable.   <br /> <br />All you people calling this film beautiful or \\"honest\\", please explain a) why these characters can be believed AT ALL, and b) what is beautiful about suicide and apathy.  <br /> <br />Please everyone, wake up to the realizty of movies like this.  Physically beautiful characters combined with nice cinematography, stirring music, plus titillating scenes do NOT equal a \\"beautiful\\" creation.  A movie can be well made and still be utterly stupid and dishonest by the human story it attempts to convey.  <br /> <br />As was explained by a previous reviewer, substitute some physically ugly and utterly uncharming characters for Cage and Shue, and re-evaluate.

B000028U0Y|5.0|pgh from PA has missed the point completely. Cash's references to being in prison are metaphors for the state of the soul. Cash going to the prison is a comment on Cash's feeling of redemption of which he felt he had not earned ... or the feeling of grace in his life.   Contrary, to your statement that Cash is posing.  Some of the prisoners in Folsom, at that time, had done less than Cash.  Why wasn't Cash in prison ... CASH, of course.   <br />   He's my all-time favorite artist because of his sincerity and biting honesty along with his music and voice.  This album galvanizes his entire experience in music and life at that point.  In other words, this is HIGH ART!!!
B00006I53S|5.0|I love this lens and have taken tons of photos with it...from stills to action shots.  The lens IS is great for compensating for shakes and gives clear, blur-free photos.  Continuous shooting was used for photos of a track runner and every shot came out great.  The AF on the lens is quick...it doesn't hunt for the image.  In lower lighting it does slow down but only if you have the flash off, but this is true of most lenses anyway.   <br /> <br />Because of its range, it has become the main lens that lives on my camera.  I've purchased L-series lenses and have sold them because of how much I like this lens.  Combined with the Canon XT camera, I have a great grab and go set to take awesome shots!
B00004XONN|5.0|This album changed my outlook on music. Radiohead really came into their own on this album. At the height of their popularity, they decided to pull back from what everyone else wanted to do and make a dark, stunning album unlike anything else up until then. My #1 favorite album of all time.
B00006V9A0|1.0|I just cant imagine how anyone can like this annoying band.They are amongst the worst bands to have emerged in the nineties.The lead singer of this band just screams and cant play the guitar at all.This compilation has only one decent song in Smells like teen spirit.All the other songs are bad.Please ignore the five star reviews for this disaster and get any album from LED ZEPPELIN,QUEEN,AC/DC,ROLLING STONES or THE WHO instead.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I absolutely love this album. I've listened to it countless times and never get sick of it. It has a more straightforward message to it (as compared to Kid A and Amnesiac), but it still has its Radiohead mystique to it. Popular music these days tends to ignore the issues of the world, but Radiohead is a fresh wake up for us all.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin are the greatest rock band ever and this is their best and highest selling album all over the world and is a landmark heavy rock album which has sold in excess of 23 million copies worldwide.this great album features anthems like BLACK DOG,STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN,WHEN THE LEEVEE BREAKS and my best song ROCK AND ROLL.Very highly recommended.Ignore the ONE star reviews for this great album and avoid albums from highly overrated bands like Nirvana,Green Day and Guns n roses who suck.
B000002UR7|2.0|Even as dedicated of a Radiohead fan as I am, I really don't care much for this album. I say thank goodness for \\"Creep\\" because we may have never heard from them again (or at least not in the same way) if that song had not become as popular as it did.

1577311523|1.0|It is not the worst book I have read by any means in this area, There are a few others maybe four. Tolle takes the idea of living in the now which is a very common and old idea, as if he just found it by himself and it is his idea. Then he writes a book about it copying the title from another book which uses the same words \\" the power of now\\".Very clever as it is so eyecatching. However having read other books in the same vein this book totally confuses itself in its eagerness to promise so much. No wonder its a best seller. Thank goodness I was too far down the spiritual path and not a complete beginner to get caught up in its hooks and traps.
B000002TQV|3.0|After the chaos ensued after the release of \\"Creep\\", Radiohead had to show that they were more than just a slacker one hit wonder band. This is not my favorite Radiohead album, but there are wonderful songs on this album. Although its a very sad and depressing song, \\"Street Spirit\\" is an incredibly flawless song. As well as the singles \\"High and Dry\\", \\"Just\\", and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", this album is definitely a knock out!
B000066C4V|5.0|Gosford Park was directed and conceived by the great Robert Altman.  As in so many Altman movies, the cast is composed of many well known actors.  In this case it works, the plot is well constructed and the screenplay well executed.  It behooves the viewer to take time to watch the first hour of the movie as it painstakingly lays down the foundation of the story and establishes the characters--this is not a thriller that will rocket you from scene to scene.  It is an old-fashioned mystery crafted by a master film-maker.<br /><br />The story unfolds over several days of shooting in a beautiful country mansion in England during the 1930's.  The class system still holds sway in this setting where many of the guests bring their own personal servants.  The problematic nature of the relationship between the haves and have-nots is the central problem  of the story and results in murder.<br /><br />Among many fine performances is Maggie Smith, a dagger tongued elderly harpy who can be heard in almost any scene languidly complaining about everything.  Derek Jacoby is touching in the few moments he is seen on screen.  Stephen Fry is unctiously amusing as a bumbling inspector, though he does chew the scenery a bit.  Helen Mirren provides her usual amazingly adept performance, playing the iron-fisted housekeeper whose emotions are kept out of sight except to us, her audience.<br /><br />This is a very fine movie--take the time to watch and savor.
B000002UJQ|4.0|This album is amazing. At the time when it came out, there was nothing else like it. I prefer Kid A, but every Radiohead album is excellent.
0316286850|3.0|I bought this book because I don't have a lot of prowess with makeup at all, and I wanted to develop some skills using basic tools.  This book, filled with beautiful pictures of beautiful people, assumes a basic knowledge of makeup and a steady hand for application.  Maybe eventually I'll make more use of it, when I master the simple steps from other sources of information.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Not to slight the other steller musicians on this album, but come on, most of us are going into this because of Jack White.  I own all The White Stripes albums and like all of them.  That being said, there are tracks that I will usually skip.  Not so on this album by the Raconteurs.  The ten songs here are all rather diverse and standout in their own right.  I think some reviews have been pretty critical because people were expecting another White Stripes album.  You harsh critics should know that Jack would not recreate any other work he has done.  So check this album out, give it a couple of listens and enjoy it.  Oh, one more thing, after hearing this album, I am certainly going to check out stuff by Brendan Benson and The Greenhornes.  They all seem like a very  talanted bunch.
B000001TVD|5.0|this album is great. if you like heavy rock, psychedelic music, thought provoking lyrics, musical diversity, george clinton, and craziness... go get this cd! oh yeah... the song Wars of Armageddon rules. it has more sound effects than a spike jones compilation.
1400032717|3.0|Overall, I was only mildy impressed by \\"The Curious Incident...\\"  Haddon's ability to successfully take on the persona of a 15-yr-old autistic boy is creative and credible.  Otherwise, I think this novel is overrated in its status as a full-blown novel.  I would better label it a \\"mildly amusing vignette\\" that was drawn out too long.  For example,  I was initially amused at the creativity of including sketches to demonstrate the narrator's neurotic thought processes and simultaneously break up the text.  The ticks and quirks Haddon assigns the character (i.e. hating the colors \\"yellow\\" and \\"brown\\" or going into emotional overload in crowded places) are what makes Haddon's character come to life.  However, for the me the story line never reaches its full potential.   <br /> <br />By the novel's close, Haddon is appendixing solutions to algebra problems to display the extent of the character's love of logic and order. Little bit much in my opinion. <br /> <br />A quick read that may better appeal to the math lover or obsessive personality enthusiast.
B000002LQR|5.0|this is a very consistent album for the chili peppers. the playing is strong throughout, and though kiedis' voice is stronger on later albums, his rhymes flow like a mofo. different musical styles abound, yet the shifts are never jarring. the fact that any band could put a 72 minute disc together which is pretty strong throughout is a pretty amazing accomplishment in and of itself. oh yeah... the production gets props too. very clean. you can hear an organic band that isn't hidden under layers and layers of overdubs or backed by an orchestra. thank rick rubin for not going phil spector on us. (phil spector's a great producer, but i think he would frustrate the f**k out of RHCP). go get this cd.
B00005BL2A|5.0|One of the most romantic, and definitly the sexiest of all DM albums, Dave's voice give perfect life to Martins emotions, anyone who dislikes this album, doesn't truly understand DM, or more importantly Martin Gore.
B000001FMX|4.0|hey. this album's pretty darn good. lotza classic tunes on this disc. musically, lyrically, and historically, this band fits somewhere between the stooges and the ramones. 'nuff said.     production's kinda week though. i don't like the way the guitars were mixed either. they should have had more prominence. somebody remaster this thing!    nonetheless, great band, great lead vocalist, Trash rules.
0064430227|5.0|Oh! the places you can go with a purple crayon.  Hard to believe it has been 50 years since Crockett Johnson first penned Harold.  It is such a fantastic series, I think I have all the little books, including Harold's Fairy Tale and Harold's Circus.  These books are sure to delight small children and parents alike.  Just make sure you have plenty of paper and crayons on hand, or you may soon find these books marked up, as children love nothing more than to expand on these adventures.

B0002EXH54|5.0|Megadeth rocks! No ifs, buts, or ors about that one; Mustaine and the crew are metal gods. I have 5 'deth cds (namely Countdown, Youthanasia, RIP, System has Failed, and this bad boy). Like other reviewers, I believe that all these cds are different from each other and are special in their own way. I dont expect anything from each cd I get nor do I hope that its like another one; I just pop it in and listen to it with an open mind. Now a little history: My first Megadeth item that got  me into them was a DVD Video Hits. It has 6 songs on it all from different cds. My favorite at the time, however, was Symphony or Destruction, so what did I get next? Thats right; the bad boy Countdown to Extinction. It blew me away and after getting 3 mor fantastic cds, I acquired Peace Sells. It drew me in from the opening lines of Wake up Dead, and didnt let go. The solos are seriously some of the best I've by Megadeth and other bands. Mustaine's voice is in perfect form and the crunching riffs never get better than these. I didnt think Megadeth could do better than RIP; I thought wrong!!<br /><br />Wake up Dead: Delicious song! Starts off with a quickly little bass line, a verse from Dave, and after that its riff after changing riff, shredding solos, and glory abounding. Not very many  words, but who cares, its the music anyway, right? 9.5/10<br /><br />Conjuring: To not get myself wrong, I love this song. Every  riff, time change, and verse/chorus is a masterpiece. I will say this, however. Dave's voice is sort of morphed on the first verse. It does sound sort of cool for an intro, but then as you will hear, his voice is still morphed through the whole song! I likes the bonus track of this song better for that reason only. Dont get me wrong, still a 9.5 star song!<br /><br />Peace Sells: What can be said about this gem that hasnt been said; its one of Megadeth's anthems and its a masterpiece. 10/10<br /><br />Devil's Island: An underated song, why? From the opening riffs to the chorus to the thrash verses, to the amazing speed solos, this song is a treasure. Definetly a good one. 9/10<br /><br />Good Mourning/Black Friday: The acoustic intro is amazing and the first verse starts off the song in a darker mood. Then with a sudden time change, and little drum fill the song races to be one of Megadeth's faster thrash songs. Its definetly a top 10/10<br /><br />Bad Omen: I love the guitar at the beginning! The lyrics, if you read them, are pretty sweet too. The bass also has a complex part. Another not-to-be-missed gem! 9/10<br /><br />I Ain't Superstitious: This cover song is pretty decent. Its the worst song on the album in my opinion but its not a bad one. It doenst really fit with the format of the album, which is good because it gives the listener a variety but it doesnt really sound like a song Megadeth would cover! Not bad; the solos were created by Poland and Mustaine and they are of course sweet. 8/10<br /><br />My Last Words: The music on this song fit the most together. I love how the bass comes in with a little riff. A great song with a sweet finale. Another Megadeth gem! 9/10to the chorus to the thrash verses, to the amazing speed solos, this song is a treasure.

0393327345|4.0|\\" The first rule of fight club is that you don't talk about fight club\\". So I really shouldn't be talking about this book. But it is such a great book I feel I have to talk about it. <br /> This book is an underground classic. It is a dark comedy/thriller that will keep anybody that reads it on the edge of their seats until the end. The author Chuck Palahniuk does a wonderful job on commenting on people's empty consumer driven lives. This book is full of quotes and passages that are subtle but stick with you.  <br /> The movie was one of my favorite movies of all time. And even if you have seen the movie, the book is defiantly worth reading. There are many passages that I think should have been included in the movie. I hate to read, but I really enjoyed this book   <br />
0140544518|5.0|This book is hilarious and extremely creative. The illustrations are very original and help explain the story. I'd reccomend this book because after hearing \\"The Three Little Pigs\\" many times, I bet that kids get bored. This story puts a new spin on the classic tale, and you'll enjoy every moment of it.
0307277674|5.0|This book is very exciting and it takes you througha very suspenseful ride! There are soo many exciting plot twists!<br /><br />Even though the book challenges all of the things that I believe about Jesus, it is still a great read. :-)
B000025H0Q|5.0|This Nick Drake music is really interesting; it combines elements of jazz and pop with effective instrumental arrangements; it has a quiet, brooding feeling. The introduction is warm and atmospheric, and this theme is used again, disguised, in later songs (most obviously in At the Chime of the City Clock), showing a strong unity in the album. Many interesting effects are used such as cinematic arrangements with strings, backing vocals, horns, accompanying the guitar, and there is huge variety of chromatic harmonies and music styles, from the wistful, jazzy \\"Poor Boy\\", to the light instrumentals \\"Bryter Layter\\" and \\"Sunday\\", to the lamenting \\"One of These Things First\\". A wonderful collection of diverse, poetic music, that is at the same time a coherent composition as a whole.
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down. A once very unknown band that broke into the mainstream with their 2001 album \\"Toxicity\\". This is their first CD and in many people's opinions [including mine] their very best.<br /><br />System of a Down, or SOAD, has been labeled as \\"nu-metal\\" basically because they came out with this CD around the time that nu-metal was big. But they are DEFINITELY not. No turntables, no rapping, no 2 power chords over and over. I don't mind some nu-metal but System of a Down being put into the same genre as Limp Bizkit just makes me mad.<br /><br />OK, anyways, this album is basically known by its single \\"Sugar\\", which is a great song, but not the best on the CD. Some posers who started listening to System of a Down because they were on MTV or something like that might not like this CD because it didn't really have any huge radio hits. But hey, I should get to the tracks.<br /><br />And remember, the ratings I give these songs are based on System Of A Down. The worst song ever by SOAD would pretty much beat out any other band.<br /><br />1) Suite-Pee: Starts it off good. 10/10<br /><br />2) Know: Odd. But hey! System of a Down are odd. 10/10<br /><br />3) Sugar: Their first single. 10/10<br /><br />4) Suggestions: Meh... nothing terribly special. 8/10<br /><br />5) Spiders: Breaks away from metal and becomes melodic. 10/10<br /><br />6) Ddevil: From melodic... to this. Short and weird. 9/10<br /><br />7) Soil: Great song about suicide and/or death. 10/10<br /><br />8) War?: Heck frickin' yes. 10/10<br /><br />9) Mind: Longest SOAD song ever, I think. Drags on a bit. 8/10<br /><br />10) Peephole: Don't you ever get stuck in the sky. 10/10<br /><br />11) CUBErt: Less than 2 min. long, but still a standout. 10/10<br /><br />12) Darts: The CD would not be complete without this. 10/10<br /><br />13) P.L.U.C.K.: The last song. About the Armenian Genocide. This song is perfect in every way. 10/10<br /><br />As you can see, this CD is the best ever. What can I say, I'm addicted.<br /><br />IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BUY THE WHOLE CD, I RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING TRACKS TO DOWNLOAD OFF OF ITUNES OR ILLEGALLY SMUGGLE OR WHATEVER:<br /><br />Get Sugar, Spiders, Soil, War?, and P.L.U.C.K. I would recommend Darts and CUBErt, but they're too short to pay a whole dollar for off of iTunes. But you get what you pay for. :)<br /><br />But you're probably better off just getting the whole damn thing.<br /><br />Final Verdict: A heck of a debut by the best band of all time. Nu-metal?

B00008H2LB|2.0|Now, I am only 14. All around my school are people listening to Fall Out Boy, Simple Plan, emo and Limp Bizkit. I find that sad. Now because I am a teenager, people will think I automatically like all that stupid music. But no. And this is exactly the kind of music that those people listen to.<br /><br />Mindless screaming and whining about how their life sucks and how they wanna commit suicide and how \\"you\\" ruined their life. Heh heh heh, exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about.<br /><br />Now I don't automatically bash bands because they're played on the radio or they're mainstream. I like System of a Down, some Disturbed, some Slipknot, you know. Although I mostly like underground stuff such as Nile, God Forbid, Opeth, Satyricon and Fear Factory, I have some mainstream stuff in my collection. But I still don't watch MTV [with the exception of \\"Headbanger's Ball\\" on MTV2, that's an AWESOME show].<br /><br />This is nu-metal. There is no denying it, they rap in every track and the lyrics even suggest they could be emo. But I'll stop talking and rate the tracks. I'll give you a piece of some of their \\"great\\" \\"sad\\" lyrics for some of the tracks.<br /><br />1) Foreword: Who the crap cares?<br /><br />2) Don't Stay: Starts off with off-tune vocals and teen angst screaming. \\"Forget our memories/forget our possibilities/what you were changing me into/give me myself back and don't stay.\\" WOW. 3/10<br /><br />3) Somewhere I Belong: Turntables and talk about how he doesn't belong anywhere. :( Oh no I feel so bad for the whiny rich kid. 4/10<br /><br />4) Lying From You: Almost a rap start, but this track is kinda loud. If that rapper singing the verses would just go away, it would almost be almost good.<br /><br />5/10<br /><br />5) Hit The Floor: Actually one of the better tracks on here.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />6) Easier To Run: Horrible in every way possible. 1/10<br /><br />7) Faint: In 2003, you couldn't go around 10 minutes without hearing this or \\"Numb\\" on the radio. This was actually Okay, \\"Numb\\" however was bad. 6/10<br /><br />8) Figure.09: Oh wow, I just noticed there were notes in the little booklet. \\"This song originally had rapping in the verses, then was rewritten with singing verses during the process at NRG.\\" Who the hell cares? 4/10<br /><br />9) Breaking The Habit: Oh, now the rich kid is like drugged up or something. Just bad. 2/10<br /><br />10) From The Inside: More turntabling? It seems like people would be tired of that by now. Horrible vocals. 2/10<br /><br />11) Nobody's Listening: The most rappy song on here. It's okay, but teen angst vocals, turntables and that horrible white rapper man just kinda ruins it. 5/10<br /><br />12) Session: Hey look an instrumental! Nothing terribly special. 4/10<br /><br />13) Numb: No. Just no. Now you're trying to be melodic. It doesn't work. Stop trying. No. No. \\"Tired of being what you want me to be/ Feeling so faithless/ Lost under the surface/ I don't know what you're expecting of me/ Put under the pressure/ Of walking in your shoes.\\" JUST BAD. 2/10<br /><br />No way would I recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to hear some rich white men trying to rap. It almost reminded me of the Beastie Boys, only the Beastie Boys were actually sort of good in the day.<br /><br />I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM. HOWEVER, IF YOU FEEL LIKE DOWNLOADING A COUPLE OF TRACKS FROM THE ALBUM, FEEL FREE TO DOWNLOAD:<br /><br />\\"Hit The Floor\\" and \\"Faint\\"<br /><br />Final Verdict: Teen angst lyrics mixed with whiny vocals, turntables and rapping.

0316172324|4.0|I enjoyed \\"Blink\\" a great deal. I greatly appreciated the discussions of \\"thin slicing\\" and unconscious thinking, reasoning, and judgments, and found them to be in congruence with other works I have read by psychologists, notably the brilliant Paul Ekman who is able to accurately predict the potential for divorce in marriages after only a brief observation. Interestingly, all of us are able to reach conclusions in much the same way that Ekman does, though we are not cognitively aware of it; this frequently accounts for initial impressions or rapid decisions that, while unexplainable on a conscious level, are actually deeply and quickly processed reactions to our perceptions of events. For more on this subject (mostly from a personal protection standpoint) I also recommend \\"The Gift of Fear\\" by Gavin De Becker.<br /><br />I am very enthused with Gladwell's critiques of micromanagement, and believe that not only is he correct that the time and energy diverted from workers by over-attentive supervisors is detrimental to workplace performance, but motivation and creativity as well. Upper level administrators should read this book with an eye to problems in their organizations.<br /><br />This is a very thought-provoking book about how we rapidly process information with a high degree of accuracy in our subconscious. As such, I found it informative in understanding hunches, suspicions, and initial impressions that we all make, though we aren't quite certain how or why. I was planning on giving the book five stars up until the very end, when the book just closed. The book really seems like an unfinished work: one page there are interesting, valid arguments being made, and the next page it's over. Were it not for the abruptness of the conclusion, I would easily give the book five stars: it is brilliantly conceived, and generally well executed; it is highly readable and utterly absorbing. I recommend this book without reservations.

0385510454|5.0|This book was great it brought you from a federal prison all the way to Italy.  With the main charater Joel Backman who is a powerful broker/ lobyist in Washington.  John Grisham uses the same style of writing in alot of his books, were it starts off bad for the main character but throughout the story the problem is worked out.  This book goes beyond a man in hiding it shows you a little bit of italian life and dinning.  Also brings in some espionage which makes the book exciting to read.  I put this book on one of my top 5 favorites.

I also thought that maybe, just maybe, someone had slipped some bad acid in my soda when I wasn't looking...everything seemed vague and disjointed, and time...it seemed like this movie was over 7 hours long! See it if you must, but don't say you weren't warned! Oh, the one star rating...I would have picked zero--but it wasn't an option.
0446677450|5.0|A few years back I would have most likely NOT read this book. Raised not to talk about money and then later in life finding myself seated towards the 'intellectual' end of the table I was foolishly somewhat of a money snob. I guess too that the smugly grinning Kiyosaki in his Christmas jumper or the pic. of Kiyosaki and wife astride white horses (Japanese cover) also did nothing to inspire my confidence or to hint at what greatness lay beneath the cheesy dust-jacket. Thankfully I am over that and ready to receive.<br /><br />I'd like to quote two points from the book that illustrate that period well -<br /><br />\\"Too many people think with their mouth instead of listening to absorb new ideas and possibilities, they argue instead of asking questions\\"...<br /><br />\\"'Intelligence' combined with 'arrogance' equals 'ignorance'\\"...<br /><br />The above maxims give you a flavour of what you will get between the covers. Rather than obvious PMA or thin motivational speeches what you will find is an insightful, illuminating, engaging, stimulating and though-provoking book (or at least you should).  In many ways what  Kiyosaki is presenting us with here is a rather improbable melange of schools of thought, a neo-confucian mindset coupled with a hard-core capitalist. A blend which creates a dynamic and practical to get yourself out of the 'rat-race' and onto the 'fast-track'. Packed with very real examples and step-by-step guidance Kiyosaki presents his thesis in a language that will exclude no one. The quandary then is if you choose to hear him or not. As he says \\"All of you were given two great gifts: your mind and your time. It is up to you to do what you please with both. With each dollar bill that enters your hand, you and only you have the power to determine your destiny. Spend it foolishly and you choose to be poor. Spend it on liabilities, you join the middle class... Every day with every dollar, you decide to be rich poor or middle class\\" - wise words indeed!<br /><br />As a footnote it's worth noting two things, if you sift through the one or two star reviews above in many ways they are more illuminating than the higher orders, and it is those that really show the difference between the 'have-nots (read; don't want) and 'haves' (read; wants). Those one and two star reviews really reflect back a good deal of what Kiyosaki talks about. The second point is that as with any work of this nature it needs reading and understanding in the widest possible context. One of the only ways you can do this and fully appraise what the author advises is to<br /><br /> i) read a number of other related books.<br /><br /> ii) put into practice what the book advises.<br /><br />Thank you.>As a footnote it's worth noting two things, if you sift through the one or two star reviews above in many ways they are more illuminating than the higher orders, and it is those that really show the difference between the 'have-nots (read; don't want) and 'haves' (read; wants).

(I bought it to listen to in the car where I can't read the book.) That said, it is very entertaining and a good listen. It is only 1 hour and 9 minutes long. Enjoy it but don't expect the audio book.
0446677450|5.0|A few years back I would have most likely NOT read this book. Raised not to talk about money and then later in life finding myself seated towards the 'intellectual' end of the table I was foolishly somewhat of a money snob. I guess too that the smugly grinning Kiyosaki in his Christmas jumper or the pic. of Kiyosaki and wife astride white horses (Japanese cover) also did nothing to inspire my confidence or to hint at what greatness lay beneath the cheesy dust-jacket. Thankfully I am over that and ready to receive. <br /> <br />I'd like to quote two points from the book that illustrate that period well -  <br />\\"Too many people think with their mouth instead of listening to absorb new ideas and possibilities, they argue instead of asking questions\\"... <br />\\"'Intelligence' combined with 'arrogance' equals 'ignorance'\\"...  <br /> <br />The above maxims give you a flavour of what you will get between the covers. Rather than obvious PMA or thin motivational speeches what you will find is an insightful, illuminating, engaging, stimulating and though-provoking book (or at least you should).  In many ways what  Kiyosaki is presenting us with here is a rather improbable melange of schools of thought, a neo-confucian mindset coupled with a hard-core capitalist. A blend which creates a dynamic and practical to get yourself out of the 'rat-race' and onto the 'fast-track'. Packed with very real examples and step-by-step guidance Kiyosaki presents his thesis in a language that will exclude no one. The quandary then is if you choose to hear him or not. As he says \\"All of you were given two great gifts: your mind and your time. It is up to you to do what you please with both. With each dollar bill that enters your hand, you and only you have the power to determine your destiny. Spend it foolishly and you choose to be poor. Spend it on liabilities, you join the middle class... Every day with every dollar, you decide to be rich poor or middle class\\" - wise words indeed! <br /> <br />As a footnote it's worth noting two things, if you sift through the one or two star reviews above in many ways they are more illuminating than the higher orders, and it is those that really show the difference between the 'have-nots (read; don't want) and 'haves' (read; wants). Those one and two star reviews really reflect back a good deal of what Kiyosaki talks about. The second point is that as with any work of this nature it needs reading and understanding in the widest possible context. One of the only ways you can do this and fully appraise what the author advises is to <br /> i) read a number of other related books. <br /> ii) put into practice what the book advises.  <br /> <br />Thank you.
B00005JOQ9|5.0|not because of all the slicin and dicin. but cause it depicts very accurately the world we live in.  <br />i will not be recanting thefable, as you can read that in other readers' reviews. <br />the scary bit about this movie is the picture of our youth, flower and future of mankind, in constant pursuit of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.  <br />emptiness and misdirection of man who, having tried EVERYTHING, loses the joy of life, loses taste for things simple normal and nice.  <br />the scariest bit about this movie is knowing that this sort of thing happens to people (not to mention animals and plants) like you and me, right now, in hellholes of our planet. <br />exploitation of man by man, raping and killing each other and the nature, is raping and killing our own souls.
B000059H98|4.0|I saw the movie in the theater, over and over on cable back in the 90s, and more recently, last week.  I remember when I saw it in the movies, I didn't know WHAT to think...I was a pretty mainstream person at the time, and this was a bit 'outside the box' for me.   <br />BUT I LOVED IT...and still do.  Ya'll know the summary so I won't repeat it here, but Lori Petty is perfect as the fly the seat of her pants smart aleck who loses her family and falls in love at first sight with a tank,  (Reminds me of the first time I saw my first car.)  and goes on a rescue mission to get back her little girl, picking up numerous other oddballs along the way.  One of which, is none other than Ice-T..he is the mouthy pseudo boss of the Rippers, kangaroo mutants who join forces with Rebecca and Jet Girl...who, I didn't even realize was Naomi Watts (!!!) until reviewing the credits.   <br />As a mom, I will encourage my daughter to watch this movie.  The heroes are women..and they are not only tough, but funny and real...or as real as you can get in a sci-fi B movie.  (Ya'll get my meaning.)   <br />It's just brainless, hilarious, raucous fun..and if you squint, and listen really hard, you might just hear the warning that runs throughout the movie.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|This new Chili Peppers album is awsome.  There are only a few off tracks on the whole album, which is damn good considering that there are 28 tracks.  Jupiter is a better cd than Mars but not by much.  Comparably, the two cds are very well balanced as far as how many great songs each one has.  Some of my favorite tracks are 21st Century, Desecration Smile, Snow (Oh Yeah), Slow Cheetah, Charlie, Wet Sand, Made You Feel Better, Tell Me Baby, and C'Mon Girl.  The album is melow compared to their earlier stuff but I love it that way.  I love their old stuff but their best songs have been the chill melodic type, such as Under the Bridge, Scar Tissue, and Californication.  This album is no different in the sense that it is packed with great chill songs.  It does also mix it up with a few upbeat and funkier tracks as well.  Overall, this is a great album.  Buy it, you wont be disapointed.
0671027387|3.0|If you have read Dan Browns \\"Angels & Demons\\" or the infamous \\"Davinci Code\\", then you have read this book. As much as I enjoyed \\"Angels\\" and \\"Davinci\\", I read \\"Deception\\" and felt a strange deja vu. While entertaining, it uses the same formula as the other two books. The basic plot is just recast in the scientific community rather than the religous one.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This new Pearl Jam album is great.  It is extremely solid all the way through.  In fact, my favorite tracks come from the middle of the album.  Life Wasted and World Wide Suicide are not even their best tracks.  My favorite track, marker in the sand, has a great melody and chorus.  Parachutes, another one of my favorites, reminds me of a beatles song.  Also, gone, come back, and unemployable are great tracks.  As I said this album is solid from top to bottom.  Its definetly worth buying
0783231032|5.0|First of all, I think you should watch the original, shorter version of this movie.  The extended version has some scenes that slow down the pace and aren't really necessary. <br /> <br />I really like the sheer zaniness and energy it has.  It only seems to slow down a few times here and there to introduce a new character or story element and then it's back to the fun!  If you like fast-paced slapstick or silly comedies then you'll probably enjoy this one. <br /> <br />I'd probably compare it with Time Bandits or Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  They don't take themselves too seriously and always make me smile when I think about them.
B000BCE918|4.0|I am a hugh fan of the Jurassic Park movies and let me start with the first movie. The movie is very enjoyable and I give it 4.5/5 so it's almost excellent but sometimes the acting is a little laughable. The action is non stop and the special effects are grreat espesially for the time it was mad. The second movie The lost world Jurassic Park 4/5 is great but again the acting is abit funny and it's more foar fetched and laughable at times. The third movie Juarassic Park 3 3.5/5 is more laugahbe but still enjoaybel and action packed but is way more predicatable and corny. It's a must own box set for Jurassic Park fans.
B00067BBQE|2.0|The the quality of the band's music is good and heavier than Fallen, but the footage is edited for an ADD MTV music video audience.  Amy Lee's vocals don't sound as good live as her studio recordings.  She sounds better on the softer songs, but during the heavy ones her vocals don't have enough presence.  In addition, Amy Lee's stage posturing and dancing somewhat imitates Marilyn Manson, and is unattractive and unfeminine.  I give the DVD 2 stars, but the CD, I give 4 stars.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|The cinematographic achievements of Brokeback Mountain have been buried under the controversy generated by its argument: a homosexual relationship between two cowboys. Of course, such scandal was to be expected, because if there's a stereotype more traditional and almost sacred in the United States, is the rude and very masculine cowboy.<br /><br />The western is a genre associated with a misogynistic point of view, always related with iconic figures such as Clint Eastwood and the very macho John Wayne; so, from this limited scoop, it's not rare that Brokeback Mountain put itself in the eye of a storm.<br /><br />Based on a short novel written by Annie Proulx, the movie narrates the story between two men for almost twenty years. When they meet in the 60's, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two young kids hired to watch a herd of sheep. Ennis is the quiet, shy one, engaged to marry Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack is the free-spirited one, always happy, optimistic and a first-class dreamer. In Brokeback Mountain, both men surrender their souls to a forbidden love, and after doing this, they return to their routines, hoping to put behind a life-changing experience that would chase them forever.<br /><br />The years pass, and Jack and Ennis have their very decent and normal families. Until one day, they meet again. And this meeting marks the turbulent, painful and harrowing beginning of a prohibited and irregular relationship, with devastating consequences.<br /><br />Social prejudices, hypocritical morals, intolerance an narrow minds are some of the obstacles that Ennis and Jack's love must endure. The other obstacle, the worst, is their battle with themselves. Jack, more open and clear about what he wants, what happiness means to him, is more willing to make choices that will cost him, but he'll do them anyway. Ennis is more cautious, in part because he's incapable of admit who he really is, what are his true feelings, always afraid of what people will think, afraid of rejection, afraid of speak freely about his emotions.<br /><br />And here is where Brokeback Mountain succeeds. It's not an ordinary movie about two guys having sex or making out. It's a movie about a love that aspires, above everything, the freedom to love without censorship; a love that seeks respect, dignity and the opportunity to be lived at its fullest. Director Ang Lee has beautifully crafted one of the greatest love stories of all times, one that will transcend its characters. Slow, with a gorgeous cinematography and a paused tone, Brokeback Mountain is simply a moving and tragic tale of two secret lovers; and these lovers could very well be heterosexual. But then, who would find this original and interesting?people will think, afraid of rejection, afraid of speak freely about his emotions. <br /> <br />And here is where Brokeback Mountain succeeds.

B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill's (AKA L Boogie) debut Grammy award winning album \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" (1998) is an excellent release which continues to vibe well many years later. My introduction to Lauryn Hill came on the Fugee's second album \\"[[ASIN:B000002B5L The Score]]\\" (1996) another great album. As a lyricist L Boogie drops on point rhymes on \\"Lost Ones\\", then lights up the track singing. A passionate sounding Hill sings soulfully on the strong \\"Ex Factor\\". The smooth upbeat \\"To Zion\\" flows through nicely and leads up to the album's first single the outstanding \\"Doo Wop\\" (That Thing). Lauryn Hill then contemplates what an artist and music should be on \\"Superstar\\" while talking about making paper on \\"Final Hour\\". Sad sounding cuts follow in \\"When It Hurts So Bad\\" and \\"I Used to Love Him\\" feat. Mary J. Blige. Hill and D'Angelo deliver an impressive duet with the mellow \\"Nothing Even Matters\\". Lauryn Hill shines again on the exceptional \\"Everything is Everything\\". L Boogies rendition of \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off\\" is memorable, and Hill takes her audience to new heights on the closer \\"Tell Him\\". \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" is an album to have in any collection.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Capote takes us to the dark side of the American story in more ways than one. It's a tale about how narcissism can poison relationships and twist values. It deals with the causes and consecuences of terrible murders and it also questions the pursuit of fame and success.<br /><br />Born in 1924 in Alabama, Truman Capote wanted fame and success more than most. He has been described as the most perfect writer of his generation. Extravagant and eccentric, Capote was fascinated for public attention long before the concept of celebrity was part of the American culture.<br /><br />On Nov. 16, 1959, Capote noticed an article in a newspaper about a Kansas family who were killed. Immediately, he spoke with the editor of The New Yorker, wondering if he would be interested in an article about the murders.<br /><br />At first, Capote thought the story would be about how the small community was dealing with the tragedy. That was until Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, were arrested and charged with the crime. As Capote gets to know them, he's consumed by a story that would make him rich and famous, and eventually destroy him. His non-fiction novel, In Cold Blood, became a best seller, but Capote was emotionally devastated by the experience and it's been said that it haunted him to his death.<br /><br />Capote chronicles the unlikely friendship between writer and murderer. Capote and Smith shared a sense of defiance and loneliness, but as the film progresses, the relationship grows one-sided, and Hoffman's attitude toward Smith morphs to exploitative and manipulative.<br /><br />The film questions the tricky ethics of journalists and how Capote the writer was eventually overthrown by Capote the celebrity. That last Capote is the one who lingered in the public imagination, and Hoffman does a superb job at revealing the lonely as well as the extroverted public persona. What an extraordinary and brilliant performance. It will give you chills.<br /><br />You know you have seen a good movie when you walk out of the theater and can't stop thinking about it. For me, Capote was exactly that. It disturbed me, moved me and with blind eyes I'd recommend it to anyone. What a marvelous piece of cinema.een a good movie when you walk out of the theater and can't stop thinking about it. For me, Capote was exactly that.

B000B0WODA|5.0|The debut, granted, was killer amazing stuff. It's what The Strokes should have been and should have sounded like (in fact Take Me Out with its Strokes-like intro instantly bests the entire Strokes catalog, and we realize we've been duped into believing The Strokes were the next best thing -- believe me, you're better off getting the first three Cars records).  <br /> <br />But You Could Have It So Much Better proves that their debut was a starting point not an ending. Franz Ferdinand easily could have recycled the same sounds/songs for the second record (especially becuase there wasn't that much time between records and touring) but they took it to the next level. Songs like Outsiders, This Boy and The Fallen still are instantly recognizable as Franz songs but somehow sound just enough different from the debut to be unique. And songs such as Walk Away and Eleanor prove they're ready for experimentation -- but experimentation that isn't interesting to hear once then skip over.  <br /> <br />Indeed, this is an album that grows better with subsequent listens and shows growth without abandoning the catchy dance style you loved 'em for in the first place. Love it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|To not own this album is a sin.  And for those who don't think it stands up to Lateralus, you are rediculous.THIS ALBUM IS A MASTERPIECE, and we are rewarded for waiting so long with beautiful lyrics and all the musical genious that we have come to expect from tool.
B000EULJLU|2.0|A couple good songs but mostly a let down. The whole album pretty much sounds like one long song and Maynard has way to many effects on his vocals. He never really belts it out like he can. Overall very disappointed, mainly because I love Tool so much and this album didn't live up to my expectations.
1592401791|5.0|If you are not familiar with Howard Massey's previous writings you are in for a real treat. He is  that rare combination of great musician and terrific writer. For any contemporary musician, the details of the Beatles phenomenal musical output should be a facinating subject. Massey pulls out all of the stops here and, with Emerick, has produced a book that is a truly entertaining read as well as a treatise on how to make the recording studio a place of creative power. A must read for musicians and Beatle fans alike!
038572179X|4.0|Ambitious is a word often used for fiction that tries to stretch the boundaries and pursue something that may or may not be attainable in print. McEwan's novel describes the aftermath of a child's misunderstanding of what takes place between her older sister and the gardener's son. When Briony walks into a passionate moment between her sister Cecilia and Robert, she immediately concludes that he is a dangerous man and that it is up to her to protect her family. When she misidentifies Robert during a sexual encounter between he and her cousin, she essentially ruins a large portion of his life. McEwan's ability to juggle multiple perspectives is quite adept and his rendering of a 13-year old's psyche is masterful. I reached a point where I wanted to strangle her for her innocence and malevolence. Her young emnity towards someone who had essentially been a part of her family for years is something only a child could feel. McEwan writes with beautiful, dense prose that reminds me of 'The English Patient' and the way it's focus on detail creates a rich tapestry and a world you are fully submerged in. He most certainly should have won the Booker for this novel. My problems with the book (and the reason it did not garner 5 stars) had to do with the same ambition I found refreshing (something I have only see lately from Zadie Smith and Jonathan Lethem). The book is broken up into 4 parts and although he attempts to fast forward in time and recount what took place previously, he loses the emotional fabric that so engrosses you at the beginning of the novel. The decision to mkove away from the female perspectives in the book and recount the retreat from France from Robbie's perspective, although rich in detail, does not do justice to what takes place in the homefront. The magnitude of the crime is mentioned, but we miss key parts of the emotional destruction it wreaks both on Robbie and on the Tallis's. The ending of the novel, which is supposed to happen 50 years after the war, although respectable in its attempt not to create a picture-perfect ending, comes out flat due to its need to explain everything. McEwan could have done without the 70-year old Briony and simply ended it after Part 3 or go further with the text. The switch to the 1st person is jarring and does not have the same power you would see in a Morrison novel. The last 10 pages actually take away from the book instead of providing an explanation to the last 50 years, which it looks like he is trying to accomplish. <br /> <br />Overall, however, this novel is the way fiction should be - dense, thought-provoking, and ambitious.
6305657947|5.0|Rene Russo as Catherine Banning is great, her facial and body expressions are quite versatile as she proceeds to find and entrap the art thief, taking risks with her own heart and soul.  Communication between Pierce Brosnan as Thomas Crown and Russo is near-telepathic.    Unfortunately the bad guy gets a pass, leaving me wanting.  Enjoy the scenes at an island villa and in the NYC mansion.  If you are older, the characters look and act your age, which is often rare for a romance.    Catherine's superego is played by Denis Leary as police detective Michael--the most real person in the film--but he too gives the art thief a pass.  If you love great art, you may cry when a \\"maybe-forged\\" Renoir is destroyed.   Faye Dunaway plays 35 y.o. Crown's shrink -- Catherine from the original film -- somehow looking younger than Russo.  Anna, played by a Spanish supermodel, is such great eye-candy that the SO stated he could not see why Crown would pass her up for Catherine.  Guys can be such bores.

She gets hit on by Jennifer Tilly as Violet, the mobster's moll next door.  Eventually they pair up and plot to help Violet escape the mob and get the (literally) laundered money.  The story holds together very well, and also there's great acting from Joe Pantagliano who plays the boyfriend and eventual stooge.  There are hints of bondage, and one lesbian sex scene. <br /> <br />The Wachowski brothers narrate through the semi-silent copy of the film, with visits from the girls somewhere in the middle (they show up after the \\"scene,\\" allowing them to evade meaty comments).
0790729628|5.0|I for one prefer the theatrical version better.  While the open ending is different, the loss of the narration by Ford detracts from the film if you are a fan of film noir movies. <br /> <br />Some film historians and critics find many influences of the film noir style of film making in this film, calling it  neo-noir, cyberpunk or tech-noir. <br /> <br />To prove this film falls in this style it must include certain elements, all of which are in Bladerunner: <br /> <br />Visual style:  while not in black and white, the film does make use of dramatic shadows with low key lighting, creating a bleak environment. <br /> <br />Setting: film noirs tend to be centered around flawed individuals in a world that has no room for forgiveness.  Crime is a central element of the story and the protagonist is often a detective or  crime fighter (Decker).  Archetypal characters that are often found are corrupt cops, femme fatals (Hannah and Woods) and down and out characters.  Noir films are generally set in Los Angeles,  New York or San Francisco - so the setting in Bladerunner is dead on. <br /> <br />Morality:  Noirs tend be ambiguous, the characters may have absolute moral values, but their cynical worldview forces them, or allows them, to adopt a way of life in which the ends justifies the means.  The very ambiguity of a noir film often finds the characters searching for what is right or wrong.  Again, Bladerunner fills the bill. <br /> <br />Outlook of the film:  Film noir is basically romantic in nature and strives to tell the story of people who are trapped in situations beyond their control (the replicants with pre-set life spans) and are almost always doomed.  Film noir plots also center around the hard-boiled, disillusioned, cynical world view of the male protagonist - Decker. <br /> <br />Other common features of a film noir movie are the voice over narrations, thus the use of Harrison's voice as narrator and flashbacks to tell parts of a story. <br /> <br />If you arenot a fan of film noir or tech-noir, I can certainly understand the preference for the Director's Cut version.  But, if you like film noir, the theatrical version is the way to go.
2253150711|5.0|This young belgium writer - nominated by French Academy under her 30's, is one of the best contemporary french speaking writers. She has a strange sense of humour, an accurate aproach to FAR EAST culture (her father has been a dipomat in Japan and China,) and an extraordinary hability to build up plots on human miseries that arises disgust and empathy all together. I read all her books published in french, and I recommend them all.

B00009P1O2|5.0|By 1986, Queen was at their absolute peak.  They had placed themselves up there with the greats.  So during their Magic Tour, they decided to professionally film their Wembley Stadium concert.  They played two nights at Wembley, July 11-12 1986, and each night they packed in 70,000 plus.  Since it rained the first night, the Wembley Concert DVD is from the sunny, July 12th.<br /><br />Since there is no track listing to be found (except for the Live At Wembley CDs), I will provide you with one.<br /><br />1.

God Save The Queen<br /><br />The first thing to point out is that Seven Seas Of Rhye is only 1 minute, 18 seconds long here.  In other words, it's not the complete song.  That's okay though, since the Rest of the DVD is a gem.  Brain's guitar solo ends up at more than 9 minutes, and in the middle of the concert, Queen throws in covers of old songs.  Ending out the DVD is We Will Rock You, followed by Friends Will Be Friends.  First, it's only 2 minutes of Friends Will Be Friends, but surprisingly second, it's not the We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions combo.  That's okay, I never mind a little change once and a while.<br /><br />Overall, the concert is excellent.  It contains many great Queen songs, and other great non-Queen songs.  You have songs on here like One Vision, Another On Bites The Dust, Now I'm Here, Bohemian Rhapsody, Radio GA GA, We Will Rock You, and We Are The Champions just to name a few.  The stage is huge, and Freddie Mercury manages to cover every square inch of it.  Every moment, he's somewhere different.<br /><br />The bonus features are as followed:<br /><br />1. New Interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor<br />2. Multi Angle Feature<br />3. Rehearsal and Friday (July 11) Concert excerpts<br />4.

You'll also learn about the camera positions and see Queen in multi angle.  For four songs (One Vision, Under Pressure, Now I'm Here, and We Are The Champions) you can select one band member and watch him for the entire song.  The Queen Live At Wembley bonus disc is better that most bonus discs are.<br /><br />In the end, you get a wonderful Queen concert and an excellent bonus disc, along with a photo booklet for a list price of 20 dollars, but the sale price is usually under 15 dollars.

I've tried to figure out exactly what it is about Jack Reacher that is so compelling, and have decided he represents \\"revenge\\" in it's best light.  It's not at all emotional......he's so calm and centered and so \\"right\\".  It's almost like he embodies the part in us that's wounded, needs help and is incapable of doing it ourselves, but really wants revenge.  He's outside the law in one sense, and IS the law in another.   Read this series.....and hope Holllywood discovers it and does a decent job interpreting it.
B00005JNJV|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Batman, but this movie interested me.  Batman Begins shows how Batman `began' (hence the title - duh!).  In my opinion, if you followed Batman from the very beginning, like if you read the comic strips or saw the cartoons on TV, then you would kind of get a jist of what was going on, and treat this movie as a sequel.  I have to admit that some scenes were confusing for this reason, but it made itself up with another incredible scene.  This film is definitely worth a watch.
B000002MU3|5.0|REM Monster is an incredible CD. From the opening chords of Whats the frequency Kenneth to the closing seconds of feedback on You this is no ordinary REM album. This is my favorite REM album. Most REM purist dismiss this CD as post grunge bollocks. They are dead wrong. If you see this CD in the cut out bin buy it, heck buy two and give one to a friend.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I'm a skeptical fan of the RHCP. They first hit my radar with BSSM (brilliant album), so I have kept tabs on them since then. Now I'm skeptical because while they certainly have the gift for creating fantastic hooks song after song they score a little to high on the rock best band list going by the lyrical content of some of their songs.  <br /> <br />At times they also seem to rest a little to heavily on their ability to effortlessly create catchy songs (it seems to me anyway) and not enough on pushing the barriers on every track. Maybe reducing the amount of their songs to those that really are great, would have made Stadium Arcadium rival for their best albums. <br /> <br />However, that said, an album should be also judged against it field and therefore, against their stagnating competition, this makes them one of the most energetic and interesting bands around. <br /> <br />It must be said that the guitar (particularly) and bass work on this double disc album is exceptional. <br /> <br />The influences on this album are familiar, but in this case it doesn't seem to matter. The time gap between Stadium Arcadium and their last album gives them the breathing space to return their fans to their sound without it sounding tried. <br /> <br />The thing that stands out for me about the RHCP is that their albums are worth revisiting, another mark of a great group. While every song is not great, I can see myself returning to this album for years to come.

I leave this DVD on while I take care of things around the house to create a calming atmosphere for my daughter.

0375508414|5.0|FRIED GREEN TOMATOES is by far the best book I've ever read. Period. All too often the words \\"heartwarming\\" and \\"touching\\" get applied to a book or movie that doesn't deserve them. Not the case with FGT. I laughed, I cried, and I would have given it four thumbs up if that had been possible. A truly wonderful tale, which is well-crafted and without a doubt the best of southern fiction, FGT will live in your heart forever. I've recently become fascinated with southern authors, having just finished reading INNER VOICES, INNER VIEWS by Kingsbury, and have to say that I'm going in search of EVERY southern book out there!  Must also recommend the book PRINCE OF TIDES by Conroy, which I recently finished.

B000002MU3|3.0|this album had the potential to be the best rock n roll album of the nineties - noisy, sparsely produced and and a big 'up yours' to their own bosses at warner. however, it was rushed. the only reason it didnt come out as it might. the best song from the monster sessions didnt make the album (revolution), though there are some decent efforts like kenneth, strange currencies, tongue, i took your name, let me in, star 69. had the band waited another year, taken their time and done it right, i wouldnt be just as negative. look at it this way - take the best guitar rock songs from monster (the ones i mention above), add them to the likes of departure, low desert, binky the doormat and so fast so numb from new adventures in hi-fi, and you would have without a doubt an amazing rock album. saving grace? the artwork from the album which i absolutely love!
B00005JOVN|1.0|This movie was a very poor attempt at remaking the original.  There was absolutely NO character development before the wave struck.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|Walk The Line captures Johnny Cash's life from 1944-1968.  The movie's plotline derives from Johnny Cash's autobiographies, \\"Man In Black\\" and \\"Cash The Autobiography\\", which provide an authentic narrative of what the man was about.  The film appears to be two films in one due to its immense content of the film that reveals Cash more in depth.  There are the intimate aspects of the man and his music, and how one of the first couples of country music, John (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter Cash (Reese Witherspoon), came to be making the film a love story about the music and between two people.<br /><br />The film is quite exceptional in capturing the \\"Man in Black.\\"  Viewers will see the forces that drove him to create a unique blend of music that was all heart and soul: gospel, rock and roll, blues, and country-western.  Joaquin Phoenix's did a well-done depiction of the man, and recreating Cash during the years in which he struggled through his rise to fame, and his brief down and out with drugs.  One can see how Phoenix's performance flowed with Cash's influence within him.  Indeed, Cash helped to kick start rock and roll about the same time as Elvis Presley, especially with his involvement with Sun Records.  His story almost falls into the same lines as Elvis', but Cash's experiences looms deeper and darker than the king, which involved tragedy, blood, sweat, and tears, and final triumph.<br /><br />Walk The Line is recommended for all music lovers, especially those who are curious in understanding the history of rock and roll and the sum of all its parts.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Its not 16:9.  Its not in 5.1 Surround Sound.  The very reasons we've all been waiting for the Uncut original version for a DVD release. <br /> <br />Lucas has the right to do what he wants with his movies.  He's the creator.  But I can only buy these movie so many times.  He stated on the back of my VHS set that the original versions will never appear in another video release again.  Guess not.  I've got the latest version of the Trilogy on DVD and for now that's good enough.  I'll buy the Original Versions when it finally comes in 16:9 or HD/Blue Ray.  Lucas can make money if he releases them in the latest format.  He's now done it and he'll do it again.  So as a consumer I'll exercise my right not to buy yet another copy. <br /> <br />And if Lucas never does.  Whatever.
B000CBO04E|1.0|When I pay $30.00 for a \\"remastered\\" title, I expect that some care and expertise were taken in the mastering process. This release has neither. I had to turn my volume knob almost completely down just to listen to this cd. There is so much compression that the drums sound squashed. I wonder what master tapes, if any were used.  <br /> <br />What a shame to ruin such a good album with this shoddy release.

A family subsumed by grief, confined by societal norms, is able to, in their own way, overcome obstacles and begin to find the true meaning of love.

B000E1ZBGS|2.0|We're pretty accepting of second rate remakes. But this one is just too bad. The characters are 2 dimensional at best. Knightly's acting is -- well, it isn't acting. <br /> <br />The story line is only slightly muddled. Silly liberties were taken, throughout that modernized a story that doesn't need to be modernized.  <br /> <br />Several thumbs down.
B00005B36H|5.0|I can easily see why people get obssesed over one particular band.  Like Dave Matthews band finatics.  Those wierd people who are obsessed with Radiohead.  Music like that is speaks to certain individuals it is unique and to them they are musical geniouses.  Tool brings out something that no one will ever be able to duplicate.  Something that is raw, unbelievbley talented, meaningful and just plain amazing.  After listening to 10,000 days I believe tool has outdone theirselves with Lateralus.  Everytrack is so good you could stare at a wall and do nothing but just wear some headphones and chills will go down your spine.  Raw, powerful music that no one dares to come close to or ever will.  Amazing, pasionate songs that are addictive. Tool is genuious.  I don't care if you are someone who is a \\"die hard\\" or thinks they might have sold out.  This is some of the best music ever recorded.

B00005JOWR|3.0|There are two kinds of high school debate: the classic Lincoln-Douglas singular clash over morals and values, and the more obscure (but more prestigious and interesting) policy debate, in which a team of two develops a plan to address singular problem. Immigration, for example. Or health care. Or foreign policy. To sit in on a round of this debate is to inhabit a world where, according to the affirmative team, the apocalypse is imminent if the plan is not adopted, and, according to the negative team, apocalypse is imminent if it is. And the kids speed spit the words auctioneer-style, the better to overwhelm the opponent with evidence, arguments, subpoints. A judge has to sort it all out, take on faith that the evidence says what the kids says it does, and tab a victor. <br /> <br />A lot of Washington lobbyists cut their teeth on this stuff, as do media pundits, lawyers, and GOP strategists named Karl Rove. Policy debate teaches a variant of the Michael Corleone philosophy: You can convince anyone of anything. Considering we live in an America that cuts taxes during a war we must win for our survival - but must also be won without a draft - well, this is a pretty true and murderous thing.  <br /> <br />So \\"Thank You For Smoking,\\" a clever satire about tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) just isn't sobering enough. It's engaging intellectually - enough so to recommend it - it's very funny, snarky, at times thoughtful. But writer-director Jason Reitman - son of 80s comedy icon Ivan Reitman - is comfortable right there. It's a solid debut, but he never lingers too greatly on Nick's life as a tool. Working from Christopher Buckley's novel, the movie puts Nick in a few tight spots and gives him pause, but its final scenes either reward Nick for his fraudulence or advance some libertarian philosophy not previously articulated. Nick may wiggle away to jerk chains for another focus group - but he's just running another hamster wheel.  <br />  <br />The lead lobbyist for an \\"institute of tobacco studies,\\" Nick is charged with insisting cigarettes are safe - he presents \\"facts\\" on talk shows and in congressional hearings - and fun, which he intends to do by partnering with a Hollywood agent/producer (Rob Lowe). He also has to pay off a former cigarette pitchman (Sam Elliott) dying of cancer while bedding an agenda-driven magazine reporter (Katie Holmes), which he fits around weekly lunches with The Merchants of Death, his lobbying pals from the alcohol and firearms industry. Nick's inquisitive son (Cameron Bright) is stuffed into several scenes as minor conscience, but mostly as a prompt for Nick's monologues about the American Way. And then there's a bizarre, left-field sequence that gives Nick a taste of the opposition and his own product.  <br /> <br />There's a lot happening, and a lot of faces for Nick to wear. But Eckhart nails it. Maybe too well - he's too likable and having too good a time. Unlike Eckhart's attractive-yet-amoral persona in \\"In the Company of Men,\\" Nick wears his burdens lightly, convinced his smooth resourcefulness can slip him out of jams. And it does, including a moment in which he's asked a question that any parent would answer one way, except Nick. Reitman's handling of this scene suggests he has a greater affinity for his lead than a sense for how pitiful it is to lie out of integrity for a faulty position. Reitman depicts of Holmes' character cynically too; reporters may not have scruples, but they have more savvy than this.  <br />  <br />We're left with a distinct, original portrait of America that preaches moral equivalency years after the Big Tobacco question has been answered. A smarter movie than \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" doesn't pretend Nick got out just before the roof caved in, but shows a tobacco lobbyist in post-lawsuit era free to admit cigarettes kill to a nation happy to smoke anyway. I'm looking at a courtyard full of smokers right now, who will return to work in 10 minutes to pass another wave of smokers. Few of them <br />- maybe none of them - will see this movie. What Jason Reitman and Nick Naylor do, the nicotine does so much better.   <br />
B000BBOUU4|2.0|Everyone says this, but I gotta say it too: loved the original and the book. It was wonderful to see things from the book in the film, like the squirrels, musical numbers, and even little things like having charlie's father actually alive.  <br /> <br />But to me, the big thing that could make or break the movie was the casting of Wonka, and there are dozens of actors I would have chosen over Depp, and it is painfully obvious that this was just an excuse to cash in on depp's popularity. FOR GOD'S SAKE, ITS LIKE HE'S A STRANGER IN HIS OWN FACTORY! It's like he was visiting there for the first time, and just happened to the be the tourist of the group carrying the map, wandering around aimlessly.  <br /> <br />Neither Depp nor Wilder hit the character right on, but Wilder had that spring in his step, that twinkle in his eye that showed that he knew what was going on, and was in control at all times. The kids were horrendous compared to the eccentric, wonderfully terrible brats of the original. Charlie wasn't bad, and I'm happy to say he was very well cast, and I enjoyed him.  <br /> <br />The badly placed backstory and inclusion of Christopher Lee (whom I love) was pointless, and changed the message of the story from \\"good things work out for those who are good\\" to \\"family is most important\\". WHICH DONT GET ME WRONG, IS A GOOD MESSAGE, but not what I wanted from a story I loved. It ruined the point of them being in the factory and everything, and only worked to make Depp more pedophile-like. As another reviewer said, Burton wanted to be more faithful to the source material? Well, way to add in an entirely usless subplot that changed the entire message, Tim!  <br /> <br />Visually, it was stunning, as all Burton films are, and the score was creepy and marvelous, brought to us once again by the peerless Danny Elfman. Depp lost his appeal to me a while ago, and this was just salt on the wound, to watch him try to tackle a role that I loved and cherished. I keep saying it, they should've had Mr. 'more cowbell' himself Christopher Walken. Come on! 'Willy Walken and the Chocolate Factory'! Think about it: \\"Children...Welcome...to my factory?\\"
B000002H33|5.0|It's really creepy how any heavy band on ozzfest, hellfest, or whatever has pointed to this album as a turning point in thier playing. Yet, I had not heard it until about a month ago. I was blown away, not only by how awesome and original it all is, but how IT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE EVERYTHING TODAY! I was shocked to find that not only did this change everything back in '86, but there has been NOTHING new done in 95% of metal/hardcore/metalcore of the last twenty years. It could easily be released as a new album today by the latest cookie-cutter band on Ozzfest that are hailed as \\"saviors of heavy metal\\". So why hasn't it? Because this was done first and everything today that has followed is just trying to imitate it. Go for the source, Metallica did it first, they did it right.
6305882592|5.0|This movie is sooo 1971 - and that is not a bad thing. It was directed by a member of \\"the greatest generation\\" (Hal Ashby) about a member of his parents' generation (Maude) helping a member of the baby boomers' generation (Harold) choose to seize life rather than go on embracing a kind of living death. The details of the film have been rehashed by several hundred previous reviewers, so I won't do that once again. I will point out that it is interesting that the intended audience for this film - the baby boomers of 1971 who were then in their teens and twenties who so embraced this film then and still do through all of the websites dedicated to its nostalgia - have become what they claimed to abhor in this movie over the last 35 years. They have, in fact, become the most prudish bunch of old people since the Puritans landed at Plymouth Rock. Their collective slogan has changed from \\"Let It All Hang Out\\" to \\"Let All Who Do Not Conform Be Hanged!\\". Thanks to the collective legislative efforts of the baby boomers - shortly to begin their second stint in diapers - we do not dare let a 20 year old (Harold's age in the movie) drink one beer even in the bedroom of his own house. We do not dare let bar owners (now only in some jurisdictions, but coming soon to a jurisdiction near you!) allow smoking in their establishments by anyone no matter what their age, and worst of all the land is dotted with zero-tolerance policies in which a child who shows up to school with an unauthorized aspirin is often treated the same as a child who shows up to school with crack cocaine or a gun as far as expulsion goes.<br />The point of my rant is this - If the Maude of the film were somehow brought back to life today, more than likely she would find Harold acting more like his mother than even his mother did and would likely want to take that handful of pills that ended her life a second time - for completely different reasons.<br />This really is a great film, and I would really hope that when I am 79 I am a cross between the Maude of this movie and Einstein and his compadres in the film \\"IQ\\". More than that though, I watch this film to remind me how it is a daily battle to stay young at heart and open to the simple pleasures of life. A battle that so many of my older fellow baby boomers have long since lost.am 79 I am a cross between the Maude of this movie and Einstein and his compadres in the film \\"IQ\\".

B000BVQ9JO|4.0|I've listened to this CD numerous times.  It's not the greatest CD I have ever heard, but definitely worth buying, and better than most of what is out right now.  Their killer guitar and interesting sound make it worth a listen.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Close your eyes and let the soundscape envelope you. That's about the best way to describe listening to \\"On an island.\\" The beautifully crafted songs carry you all the way to Castellorizon itself, the small island that lends it's name to the opening instrumental. David Crosby and Graham Nash lend their voices to the title track. Gilmour also shows off his sax playing on the track \\"Red sky at night.\\" Yep..that's him wailing away on the saxaphone. Interesting how his sax soloing sounds a lot like his guitar licks. \\"A pocketful of stones.\\" is one of the most amazing pieces I have heard in years, it blends great orchestration with very well written lyrics. Famed Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner lends his talent to this disc, his compositions blend seamlessly with David's guitar and vocals. Just when you have been lulled in to thinking the entire album is sedate, \\"This heaven\\" comes blasting out in wonderfull bluesey fashion. Some of his best soloing comes in this track. Overall this album is truly a piece of art, not many musicians out there craft anything close to this in terms of sheer quality and attention to detail. This album will never be far from your CD player. Also, Kudo's to David for making this a Carbon Neutral production. A certain ammount of the proceeds go to buying \\"Carbon offsets\\" which invest in re-forrestation aswell as clean energy systems to render the CO2 released during the manufacturing of the CD's neutral. This is the first mass released CD in the US to be carbon neutral.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Released in 1969, this incredible album by King Crimson not only established a new genre of music (progressive rock), but single-handedly established the different models subsequent prog bands would follow.  In short, all of the elements that characterize prog (especially ensemble virtuosity) came together in one place on this album.  Many musicologists (including this prog-obsessed biologist) regard In the Court of the Crimson King as the single most influential album of progressive rock ever released.<br /><br />The band members on this album include Robert Fripp (electric and acoustic guitars); multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald (saxophone, flute, piano, organ, mellotron); unbelievably good drummer Michael Giles; Greg Lake (bass, vocals); and last but not least Pete Sinfield (lyrics).  All of the musicians are excellent and set new standards for ensemble virtuosity that would be taken up in earnest by the major English prog bands including Yes, Genesis, ELP, Gentle Giant, Van der Graaf Generator, and Jethro Tull.  I should note that the influence of King Crimson was not just restricted to England and spread throughout continental Europe, particularly Italy - listen to any early PFM album (1972-1974) for proof.<br /><br />The pieces on the album cover a broad spectrum of styles, moods, tempi and dynamics ranging from all out rave-ups to delicate passages comprised of just flute and soft cymbal work.  The opening track 21st Century Schizoid Man features blistering riffs played in unison by several musicians and at breakneck speeds.  There are sections of this piece that are vaguely reminiscent of the furious pace of be-bop jazz.  In stark contrast to this all-out assault is the quiet and contemplative piece I Talk to the Wind, which showcases Ian on the flute.  Epitaph is my favorite piece out of King Crimson's entire recorded output and features (in all its glory and splendor), the mellotron with string setting.  This instrument, with its haunting and sweeping textures, lends this piece (and the album) an emotional sophistication that is truly something to behold.  The 12'13\\" Moonchild is an odd piece that is more of a sound collage than anything else.  Specifically, it opens with a brief and somber guitar passage and Greg on vocals, which then gives way to a very experimental and \\"free-form\\" instrumental passage that features various percussion instruments and delicate guitar parts (they verge on \\"noodling\\").  In fact, there are moments where the \\"noodling\\" gives way to sections of near silence.  The opening flourish of the closing track The Court of the Crimson King breaks the listener out of the reverie induced by Moonchild, and is structurally somewhat similar to Epitaph - just like Epitaph, it features a ton of mellotron with some great ensemble work and is pretty haunting.<br /><br />With regard to this particular iteration, the sound quality is excellent and is perhaps better than the other versions out there.<br /><br />All in all, this is a landmark recording with far-reaching influences and is very highly recommended along with Larks Tongues in Aspic (1973) and Red (1974).his piece (and the album) an emotional sophistication that is truly something to behold.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|I don't understand any human being who could give this CD less than 5 stars, unless you're a 15 year old kid who hopped on the Pink Floyd bandwagon to smoke your pot and listen to Darkside of the Moon on repeat. <br /> <br />Listen folks.. Pink Floyd is so diverse, with each and every album you should be expecting change.  With that said, have you heard of King Midas?  Well this album features King Waters... Roger Waters, that is.  Everything he touches turns to gold.  To me, Waters is the DEFINITION of Floyd.. carrying the torch of the emotional, slightly insane psychadelia which was initiated by Syd Barrett.  If you liked The Wall at all (I sure hope you did..) then you will LOVE this album.   <br /> <br />On the other hand, if you're musically handicapped and you can ONLY handle Gilmour, then maybe you won't like this for some reason beyond my comprehension.  This album is rich in emotion, passion, and the same musical genius which made \\"The Wall\\" one of (if not THE) best albums of all time. <br /> <br />Unless you're under 17 years old, or you have the musical IQ of a rabid zebra, this is a timeless album to be cherished by all Pink Floyd fans. <br /> <br />
B0002YLC24|5.0|That is what this film meant to me, looking at the kaleidiscope of life as it passes by, so sweet, so unsatisfying at times yet so perfect when the right person is there.<br /><br />This film is a poem to Paris and the passing of youth, with the hope of recapturing that one love, which when found engraves itself so deeply that it is like a hinge in the mind, always present, always remembered, always desired.<br /><br />The two lovers meet, seemingly a lifetime away from when they met by chance on a train, and with instant rapport they tell eachother in the space of a few hours everything that happened since they met 10 years earlier.  They see how much they meant to eachother, how much they still could, like two pieces of a puzzle that fit.<br /><br />This is a genuinely beautiful film, more mature than the last one, much sadder and in many ways better and more realistic.  It opened that sense of mystery that I have known, in life and its surprises and potential in the luck of finding true intimacy.<br /><br />Julie Delphy is one of those rare women who gets more beautiful as she ages.  She has become a sad person, stalled in relationships, though she is living up to her ideals.  Ethan Hawke is struggling to grow with his success, in a down phase of his marriage and needing their friendship very badly.  Their relationship, so brief, rings totally true, in its humor, commitment, and occasional awkwardness.<br /><br />Perhaps this is sentimental, but I think I have known love like this.  It is an image more in my mind than the person perhaps, but our friendship is as deep as it was when we met nearly 35 years ago.  Some people simply pierce thru to the heart, earning a permanent place no matter who they later marry or what they become.  It is an extraordinary sympathy for one another that is beyond sex (well, maybe not too far beyond...).<br /><br />Highest recommendation.  This succeeds brilliantly at a snapshot in time, with an entire history implied behind it, like the greatest art.  And I do think that the ending is ambiguous and must be interpreted, which is also so very much like real life.t the ending is ambiguous and must be interpreted, which is also so very much like real life.
0694003611|5.0|This is a sweet, sweet book. As a writer, I know how difficult it can be to express something simply and clearly. Ms. Brown was a genius in creating a mood in a few words. Goodnight Moon has a soporific, drowsifying quality. There is a rhythm, a cadence to her words. It's almost as if you are singing to your child, but without a melody. And the pictures by Clement Hurd create a nice counterpart to Ms. Brown's text. (Keep your eye on the mouse!) I think that every parent with a young child who reads to her or him at bedtime should buy this book. It is a true classic, and rightly so.
0553801503|1.0|Unfortunately this was a very disappointing read.  I was/am a huge fan of the first three books and could not put them down.  With that said, this one does not compare with those other fine novels.   <br /> <br />A Feast of Crows was full of minor characters that for the most part you care nothing about and very little real story.  In addition this book has the problem of repeating itself frequently to tell us over and over who these minor characters are and about their linage... as if that is enough to make us care about them.  As one of the other readers stated this book is desperately in need of an editor.  There is only enough interesting story to cover about a hundred or so pages (the first parts of Arya's story). For the most part the rest is a waste of paper (Brandon, Tyrion, Danny don't even make it into this book).  I hold out hope that the next one (Dance with Dragons) is back on pace with the first three...  <br /> <br />I would skip this one... or if you must, just read the chapters on Arya and maybe the last two chapters with Cersei and Samwell.  The rest is not rewarding. <br />
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The orginal version of Kingdom of Heaven was mabey a 3-star film with poor character devoplment, choppy pasing and numerous other problems. <br /> <br />The theatrical version was a good film. <br />The extened edition is a great film. <br /> <br />There were entire sub-plots in the extened editon that help the story and characters come alive. The drama is better, the romance is better, all of the major characters have more screen time and the pacing is MUCH better. <br /> <br />Don't judge the film by the theatrical version, THIS IS Kingdom of Heaven.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|Very nearly a follow-up to Vitalogy this self-titled 8th studio album returns the band to its edgier, angrier and more aggressive roots. Unfortunately, unlike Vitalogy this record does not display the raw spectacle of unabashed artistic flow that album had in abundance. What it does do, by and large is take a huge step in redeeming a band who has lost its way with fans and critics alike. Granted, Pearl Jam has never released a dead-to-rights  bad album, but the confused mish-mash of styles on No Code, the ultra-slick production of Yield and the lumbering, grinding efforts of Binural and Riot Act have placed considerable distance between them, radio, fans and record sales.<br /><br />Pearl Jam contains abundantly intriguing music that bridges the four LPS in-between to the three that preceded them. Some tracks like World Wide Suicide feel yanked from that early era in the best ways. Others, like Unemployable are so immediately catching and emotional that you feel robbed when the song starts with two strong verses, then just repeats a chorus until the end much as Daughter did on VS. That's been an issue with fans and critics, not just that the songs sometimes lack a clear structure, but that they start off strong and then never go anywhere.<br /><br />Also an issue here is why they save so many songs for b-sides? Their albums barely break 50 minutes, ever and yet with thirty minutes of blank space on the CD they do nothing with the extra tracks they write but let them drivel out later? One of their shortcomings has always been that they don't put some of their best work on the albums, about half of Lost Dogs is one of the best albums PJ has ever released but didn't.<br /><br />The strongest argument for buying this record is that no song ever mentions \\"love boat captain\\" because if I hear Eddie ruin a song by relating back to a terrible 80's television show I might just never forgive him!<br /><br />Buy this record.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|To echo the sentiments shared by a lot of reviewers here, my anticipation for these releases dropped to nothing the moment I heard the theatrical versions wouldn't even be anamorphically enhanced. Lucas has bonus features on his dvds that are technologically superior to this; unpolished 1993 laserdisc transfers are pretty much what you'd get from bootlegs and pirated online copies. I don't need to pay money for that.<br /><br />Personally, I think we'll see the original theatrical versions again in the future. If these can be released after Lucas has already put his foot down, they'll be released again. And somewhere down the line, Fox and Lucasfilm will finally get the release right. Until then, I'm not buying into any \\"limited edition\\" scams.
1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon managed to capture my attention from the first pages of this book.  While short in length, he does what some novels don't succeed at in volumes 4 or 5 times this size.  He brings you inside the mind of an autistic boy who sees the world in a very special and curious way.  The approach is so original and intriguing, I found myself laughing out loud and crying at the same time.  It is also a touching story about family relationships and everyday struggles.  Bravo!
B000BW7QWW|2.0|The movie script makes use of psychobabble and talk of behavior modification which at times is unique for a sci-fi movie.  The acting and plot is lacking in enthusiasm or creativity.  I found this movie to be boring. I am a fan of Lynch's Dune, Bladerunner, and Farscape in case you were wondering about my tastes.
B000000H3Z|2.0|Beneath the Remains, Sepultura's 3rd album from 1989 <br /> <br />This album, along with Chaos A.D. and Arise, is considered to be the embodiment of Sepultura's classic era, and many fans consider this to be one of the finest, if not the finest installment in the band's catalog. With that said, this disc offers straight ahead thrash metal and little else. There are a lot of great riffs, great solos, and a lot of time changes, which will be enough to whet the appetite of many metal fans. Be that as it may, though, you should be warned that the boys really did not make an inspired effort on this record. It's basically just a slash and shred metal record with very little creativity or personality. An album like this really can't stack up against some of the greatest creative works of the genre, such as Metallica's ...And Justice For All, Iron Maiden's Powerslave, or Megadeth's Rust In Peace. I would give a track-by-track evaluation, but nothing really stands out here. I also have a gripe with Max Cavalera's vocals. I was really not pleased with what I heard from him, as his vocal style was not very well developed at this point in his career. Andreas Kisser and Cavalera sound pretty good on guitar. The standout track would probably be \\"Slaves of Pain.\\" There's a great little bit around the two minute mark where Cavalera sings, \\"Open your eyes / Don't lose your steps / Liberty is a dream / And it also is real,\\" then it slides into a spine chilling riff and a great solo. Drummer Igor Cavalera also turns in a pretty decent performance. This disc has something to offer, but what I've come to find is that there are some albums that really captivate you and there are some albums that you just can't get into no matter what you do. Unfortunately, Beneath the Remains fell into the latter category for me. <br />
B000E5KJFC|5.0|I'm not going to rehash the plot, just deliver the scoop on the HD DVD version.<br /><br />If you love surround sound and the new HDTV monitors capable of displaying a film in 1080i, SWORDFISH is a must-buy.  The HDMI hookups pump amazing video quality and the sound separation is absolutely amazing.<br /><br />There's nothing here that you can't get on the DVD version -- unless you're geared for a true HD DVD experience.  Then this movie delivers the goods in spades.  So far, a lot of the HD DVD releases don't improve on what's already out there, but SWORDFISH really allows the video and audiophile to make great use of his systems.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|The best Batman ever! The actors were all spectacular and the typecasting was excellent. It was a great story ...very dark but true to the Batman story as told in the comic books of yesteryear. The long build up in the movie to the actual presentation of Batman was very well done and provided the groundwork for a suspenseful and exciting ending. The movie achieves a unique feat in that it retells a story in such a way that it makes the viewer feel like they are experiencing it for the first time. <br />A must for any super hero DVD collection!
6304712936|5.0|If you still prefer the theatrical release of this movie (meaning no extra storyline) then this is the one for you.  I actually have both versions and prefer this one.  Plus, this version has a bit of (tasteful) nudity; which isn't a big deal unless you're planning on showing this movie in an educational setting.  Having to swap discs is a bit of a drag, but if that's what it takes to get the original version, then so be it.
0765315246|3.0|The book is mostly an updated Starship Troopers: the protagonist enters the military in a future Earth, finds things not what he expected, experiences space war and so forth.  A few new ideas are thrown in along the way, though quite a few plot elements seem plucked straight out of Troopers.   Much of the political sub-text of Troopers is left out and replaced with attempts to plumb how the technologies affect people's perceptions of life, ala Richard Morgan, but less effectively. <br /> <br />It's a fun, diverting and quick read, albeit a bit shallow in the character development department and extremely obvious and heavy-handed in application of explanatory plot devices.  The author demonstrates that he recognizes many of the cliches that come with this type of story and makes efforts to dance past them, with some success.  The prose style is engaging, but lacks in subtlety.  It's identified as a first book, and reads that way.  Still, I'm reminded of how Peter F. Hamilton's Mindstar books came across as rather crude in comparison to his Night's Dawn books, and am hoping that subsequent books by John Scalzi will show the same maturation.  In any case, I'm certainly going to give them a try.
B00000AFWW|5.0|It is sad that this album is criticized for being overly glossed over and basically a cop out, simply because the hooks and melodies are so damn catchy and clean. It is true that compared to live through this and pretty on the inside that this album is much more accessible...but taken as a whole it is not nearly as clean and poppy as much that is heard on the radio. I can't imagine most of the songs with Courtney's raw imperfect and emotional voice being played on the radio. However, whatever may be said about its production, this is something rare and valuable. If you are considering buying this album and expecting another live through this, do not. but if you buy it just wanting to hear some SUPERIOR sounding music, full of pain and humor, do it. The songs are catchy, but the lyrics are nothing short of brilliant. I think it is to Courtney's advantage that her voice is not lilting and pretty- it makes the music something quite wonderful. I am not sure what made Hole make this stylistic change, but whatever the production may be, they are fantastic songwriters.
0440178002|5.0|It is difficult to give due credit without having to acquire similar writing skills to the author in the process. For a start, I could only wonder at how James Clavell came up with so many intrigues and what I can only describe as a culturally surprising and an exceptionally well-crafted plot. Based on my own cultural experiences, I could never have thought up most of the plot-twists. He must surely have made himself an expert on Japanese history and the consciousness of the period. Perhaps his plot also relied heavily on real examples from history. Were this not so, the power and fertility of his mind must have been phenomenal, for that is how good the plot was to my mind.<br /><br />From the moment I began reading this engaging book I became increasingly excited as I recognised how historically grounded it was. I was fortunate to have already read 'Samurai William', by Giles Milton (and also a very good book), which tells the more-or-less true story of an English sailor named William Adams who went native and became samurai after being marooned in around 1600. Straight away my imagination took me back to this almost unrecognisable Japan - a time when the Portuguese and Spanish were already established throughout the oceans, and the British and Dutch were just beginning to venture onto their (supposed) territory. I anticipated meeting some of my favourite historical figures once more, if this time adapted for fiction. Sure enough, Blackthorne, the hero of Shogun, soon proved himself to mirror Samurai William in many details, from being an English skipper with a small Dutch fleet that had first tried and failed to find a route to Asia via the Artic, to landing in Japan with many ships lost, to outsmarting Jesuit priests and winning so much favour with principle Japanese leaders as to earn himself the title, respect, and fife of a high-ranking samurai. Later on we meet other familiar characters, such as the extremely calculating Toranaga, who is, by other accounts I have read, loosely based on Tokugawa Ieyasu.<br /><br />The basic plot develops around these - and many other - elaborate characters. Shogun is the story of a foreign 'barbarian' who must urgently adapt to a radically different culture if he is going to survive there. It is the story of a 'daimyo', Toranaga, who must outsmart a legion of other cunning and dangerous characters if he is going to gain control over Japan. As I have said, the mastery with which Clavell makes his plot conform to the philosophies of the Japanese consciousness is astounding. Of course, it is also a love story, and it is an extremely colourful look at one of the most intense cultures ever to exist on this planet. It is a look at alternative assumptions on complex social relationships, and the system of order, hierarchy, virtue, and honour is highly compelling. It left me wondering all the more about some of the things that we take for granted in western society.<br /><br />Shogun is a page-turner from start to finish, especially if you are a little interested in that period of Japanese history. I could not wait each day to begin turning more of its pages so as to learn more about this time and to find out exactly how even the smallest sub-plots would pan out. I recommend it very confidently to anyone who might be interested in such a book enough to peruse through reviews the likes of this.I have read, loosely based on Tokugawa Ieyasu. <br /> <br />The basic plot develops around these - and many other - elaborate characters.

B00005JNX0|4.0|Madagascar (Widescreen Edition)~ Stephen Apostolina is a good movie for people of all ages. The music is awesome, the plot is great with amazing charchters like the vain lion, the sickly giraffe, the adventerous zebra and many other animals. I love the penguins especially with their crazy antics. There is a lesson to be learned both for young and old. This lesson being that the grass is not greener on the other side. Then they make fun of such shows like survivor and movies like cast away. Even though I like this movie alot and find that it is grand fun it is still not even close to being on the same level as movies such as Finding Nemo or Lion King and I give it 4 out of stars which is not bad at all. Recommended.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Big movies like this are reviewed and reviewed to death--over 800 people have written here alone. And yet I write one more, because this movie moved me and means a lot to me as a gay man and a human being. I don't think this movie would have worked without the transcendant power of Heath Ledger's portrayal. When Ennis Del Mar ends his life ruined by his internalized homophobia, the pain he makes us see brings us all immediately to his experience. This is what can happen to you if society and your relationship to it conspire to keep you from attaining something so important to the human condition as love.  <br /> <br />This is a big Hollywood Epic, but masterpieces are not the exclusive terrain of quirky, off-beat films. When everything works right--superb acting from all four principles, restrained yet purposeful direction, a fantastic story--you must admire the result. This is a beautiful movie, a gay movie, a human movie, an example of high achievement in the art of film. <br />
B0002Y69NG|4.0|if you like action you will love these movies. the matrix trilogy is one of the best movies i have ever seen. i loved everything about all the movies. if you have not seen these movies you should.
B000EULJLU|5.0|People saying this is a letdown or maynard didnt bring it are morons. Like any GOOD band they evolve, and have been evolving. They to me are the greatest band ever for many reasons. They acknowledge that TOOL as a band can only produce superb music through progressing life experiences and self evolution. Hence not releasing albums yearly.     This album is a prime example of artistic genius. It is a progression and is different at first listen in comparison to previous installments. After you listen to it 7-10 times you can get a better idea of how masterful this is. This is more thought provoking then people care to indulge. Most people have no clue as to whats going on in music. This was a triumphant release after the 5 years off. If you pay attention you might learn something and realize the magnitude of the effort put forth in 10000 days making it by far the best album of the year and right up near Lateralus and Aenima as Tools best.     I didnt even mention the unbelievable artwork and packaging. I bought 2 copies just based on it at 10 dollars a piece?! I would have paid $30 Including Stereoscopic lenses to enhance the artwork.  Who puts forth such an amazing package these days? I havent seen anything like this in over a decade. I'm not going to say which tracks are good or what about the art is so noteworthy. Why? If you cant figure \\"it\\" out, put your money in your pocket and buy some less meaningful, hypno turd music since art in general(music, painting/drawing ect) isnt your forte..Try bowling or fishing. This is clearly out of your league of comprehension.
B00005JKED|5.0|The headline summarizes the movie! Denzel gets the Oscar for this one. Forget Russel Crowe and his Beautiful Mind. Ethan was so brilliantly subtle. Denzel u r the best!

B0007OCG4W|3.0|This movie has everything except a script.  With a world class director like Mike Nichols, and superb actors Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law, and Natalie Portman, not to mention stunning set design and glorious photography, how could this one lose?  It was not because it was shot in one of the world's most interesting cities (anybody who has ever been to London knows what a fabulous place it is.)  There just was not much all this super talent could do with dialogue that works on the stage but does not translate well to the screen.  Some plays simply should not be photographed.  Why this should be so is an unexplained mystery, but there it is, nonetheless.  At least there is a nice nude scene of Natalie Portman from the rear, but a second later she is telling her boy friend that she is waiting for him to leave her.  Are you kidding?  I am willing to suspend disbelief but that anyone would leave Natalie Portman strains disbelief to the breaking point.  Things like that happen in real life, but as Mark Twain said, fiction has to make sense.  I was also bewildered by the last scene, in which Natalie's character ends up back in New York.  Now that makes sense in real life, because New York is an even more fabulous city than London, but the scene does not seem to be motivated in the movie and leaves the viewer bewildered. <br /> <br />Watch it if the sheer physical beauty of the film and a chance to watch some great actors is enough for you.  If you need more, as in a story, pass on it with thanks and regrets. <br />
B00005J6UP|5.0|If you haven't watched 'The Goonies' you don't know what your missing out on!

B000002JOH|5.0|I'm old now; I remember when this album came out in High School, me and my friends loved it.  With that said, I haven't listened to it in years, many years.  I don't listen to much metal anymore, a few classic albums (old Metallica when they were great, Slayer, etc.).  Why the prelude?  I thought my perspective is very necessary.  I'm not a kid (obviouisly) and as for work, I'm as white collar as you can get.  I have also been versed and trained in music. I know the difference between who can and can't play (which in certain instances can be irrelvant).    I revisted this album; put it on the ipod, the whole thing and was dealt a rush.  I thought of all the overly manufactured [...] that comes out now-a-days, all of it, whether it's consider the new metal, punk, alternative, pop music of today, most of it (not all, but most) is real [...].    I'm not hear to defend and/or applaud Dimebag, Anselmo or any of the musicians (Vinnie Paul does have some ridiculous chops though!), that's all irrevelant.  However, I can't believe some of the negative reviews this album has.  I'm an old(er) man and even I can see how much ass this album (still) kicks!  I can assure you, my \\"IQ isn't low\\" and I do \\"know about music.\\"  This album has one concept, to be raw, in your face and kick ass; guess what? It does.      VDOP does have a little bit of a hardcore feel, I even remember this when I was a teenager. As I am from (and influenced by) New York, that was something very appealing to me (still is).  I can see how some metal guys that are into the 20 minute solos and high pitched metal screams/vocals (ala Ronnie James Dio) may not dig this.    Yes, it's angst, hell, it's extreme machismo, but that is what makes this album great: raw, primal, unapologetic and aggressive.  Let go, embrace it, you may find yourself feeling alive. . .
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix The Matrix is a science fiction and action movie starring some of the biggest actors like Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano . It was directed and written by Larry and Andy Wachowski. The Matrix is about an computer hacker who goes by the name Neo (Keanu) . He's been searching for the answer to the eternal question: What Is The Matrix ? Later in his quest , he finds a hacker named Morpheus(Laurence) who tells him what the matrix really is, its just a computer program. Morpheus then shows Neo the real world out of the matrix , but the reason why Morpheus needs Neo is because he believes that Neo is the one who will stop the machines and give them their freedom. My Favorite scene was when Neo went threw training. I think this is a really good movie and you should see it.<br /><br />Also Recommended: I also enjoyed the Matrix Reloaded and the Matrix Revolutions
B00004XQP4|1.0|Green day are amongst the most overrated bands of all time.They only made one decent album in dookie.Rest of their albums are garbage.Warning is pure refined trash with lousy songs like Macy day's parade.Stay far away from all their albums which are only meant for preteens with an IQ less than 50.Get any Pearl jam album instead.

B00008EY9G|4.0|This is one of those 'little' films that sneaks under the radar. I was hooked from the start and amazed at the end. If mysteries and puzzles ala '6th Sense' are your forte, this is the film for you. CAUTION you must think to view this terrific film.

B000000OA6|5.0|Freddie Mercury's passing had to be one of the saddest days in glam/hard rock history.  Nonetheless, Freddie and the boys definitely left their high water mark with this unbelieveably powerful album.  \\"Innuendo\\" is filled with an impressive assortment of songs, ranging from upbeat songs like \\"Headlong\\" and \\"The Hitman\\" to eerie sounding songs like the title track and \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\".  The lyrics are 10 times more passionate and urgent than any of their other previously released material.  And of course, what can I say about \\"The Show Must Go On\\" except \\"Bravo!\\"  A bittersweet, but amazing work of art!

B00006AW2S|5.0|This rates as one of the best Stones albums in that it shows their Chicago blues roots!  \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\", \\"Hitch Hike\\", \\"Have Mercy\\" -- all show Mick's grasp of the great blues singers which influenced him from the time he first picked up a microphone!  (I still watch the old clips of Mick doing his James Brown shuffle and strut -- before he became his own MICK JAGGER -- and I smile like a parent watching her child doing an imitation of his idol in front of the mirror!) <br />Though this Stones gem does fall in second to \\"Rolling Stones NOW!\\" as far as the early stuff goes, this record is truly a classic collection of Stones blues at its BEST!  Shine on, Brian Jones -- and we don't care about that stupid movie \\"Stoned\\"!  (Though the single of the same name is not too bad!) <br />P.S.  I noticed a reviewer here with the last name of Lapinskas!  Ed, are you a fellow Lithuanian???  AND a Stones fan???!  Wahoo!

B00004RJ74|4.0|Watching this movie is like viewing two separate movies that are loosely related. The first half is classic Tarintino with excellent dialogue and bizarre situations. The second half is entirely different than anything Q.T. has ever done. At first I didn't like it, because I was hoping for another Pulp fiction, but after I let it stand on its own I realized it is very good.
B000BJS4BM|4.0|I loathe Madonna and everything she has done except for her first 2 albums, Music, and this.  Like Music, one gets the feeling Madonna had more than a little help in the songwriting dept.  The tracks feel like someone elses, with Madonna inserting herself here and there.  But great artists know how to borrow beg and steal from others and Madonna does all three. <br /> <br />The tracks are often brilliant.  Using Abba on the title track, to sound like middle eastern disco creates a classic.  Nearly every song uses a simple device:  taking a line or melody from a classic, and using it as a hook without the rest of that song.  This is little more than sampling, without actually using a sample, and is part of dance and rock tradition. <br /> <br />This is surprisingly good, and the best thing she has done except for Music, in the latter half of the career.  This CD got little attention, probably because she feels so 'over' and puts out so much mundane music among better works.   <br /> <br />To get credibility back, maybe she should quit humiliating herself trying to act.

B00005J6UP|5.0|Everyone who saw this in the 80s loves this movie.  I frankly caught it on cable, but was already a preteen I think, so not quite under its spell.  However, it is sophisticated swashbuckling entertainment and just so integrated into the first half of the 80s that I think everyone in their teens even saw it on HBO.  It has talentless teen stars like one of the 'Coreys', has Cyndi Lauper music and Capt. Lou., and a classic Donner/Spielberg feel like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Close Encounters. <br /> <br />Trully a classic defining that era that is overlooked vs \\"the breakfast club\\" and others, because it aimed at a younger audience.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I am disappointed in all these douche bags complaining about the copyright issue. The album is awesome. I love how they set up the two discs, with a slow one and a heavier one. You don't need to screw around. This is Dave at his best. Don't rob the band of their well deserved praise.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Everyone knows this story so I will be brief.  1979 version w/ Jessica Lange had a stronger sexual element to the monkey/girl relation, but was very touching nonetheless.  The relation here is more of an 'obsession' with a prized possession to protect, that the gorilla has with the girl, versus some type of purely sexual interest. <br /> <br />I hate to say it, but here goes, fellows, we have all been that ape at one time or another.  You know what Im saying.  So the story is universal in that we can identify with the feelings of the protagonist, even if it is a monkey. <br /> <br />Certain scenes are visually unforgettable.  Such as when Kong escapes the theatre and finally sees the Girl again in NYC, walking smokily down a blue lit street in pitch black winter.  You can see his expression go from fear it wont be her, to calm, and sad acceptance.  Throughout, Kong looks doomed and aware of it, even on the island.  He seems to be an older creature, and tired of the throne, which makes the protector relation to the girl more convincing. <br /> <br />Really, a true classic.  Snubbed at the Oscars, but then LOTR was grossly overpraised, so it evens out.  Do not miss this.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I did read the reviews about this sweeper before I bought it, but the good reviews outweighed the bad.  I'm so glad I made the purchase.  It does exactly what it says it will.  I haven't had a lick of problems with it.  I use it daily for about 3-5 minutes at a time and have only had to charge it about once every two weeks or so.  It's great if you have dogs and want to keep the dog hair and dirt they track in to a minimum.  It doesn't take the place of the vacuum, but it's so convenient.  I love it...
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|In an age of generic, studio-produced music comes Wolfmother, an Aussie band that pays hommage to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath but with their own original and updated sound.  These guys ROCK! They are truly talented musicians, with great guitare and drums. I love the entire album (although Apple Tree is my least favorite). This album is fun, loud and motivating.  I look forward to the next release.
B000002KBA|5.0|In 1968 and 1969, Deep Purple Mark I (Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Paice, Jon Lord, Nicky Semper, Rod Evans) released three albums, on the Tetragrammaton label (a label ran by famous comic Bill Cosby), that is Shades of Deep Purple, The Book of Taliesyn, and their self-entitled album. These albums also had British releases, the first being on Parlophone, the other two on Harvest (although released a few months later after the US releases, for some odd reason). The first two albums consisted of a bunch of covers of other people's songs, including \\"Hush\\" and Neil Diamond's \\"Kentucky Woman\\". The third album only had one cover, that is Donovan's \\"Lalena\\". These albums found the band performing psychedelia, prog rock, pop, and early hard rock, sometimes not always the most convincing, but they still made a lot of excellent material. It was with their third album that they hinted at a new, heavier direction they would be exploring in the new decade like \\"Bird Has Flown\\" and \\"Why Hasn't Rosemary?\\", but they still tended to be tame in comparison to the Mark II-lineup albums because Ritchie Blackmore was still playing psychedelic and prog rock styles on his guitar. After their third album came out, Nicky Semper and Rod Evans were out of the picture, in comes vocalist Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover. Because Tetragrammaton was going under by this point, the group sought a deal in the US with Warner Brothers (but stayed on Harvest in the UK). They first did an experiment with rock band and orchestra called Concerto For Group and Orchestra, which bewildered a few fans and was criticized for not having very much rock band and orchestra interaction (apparently even less band/orchestra interaction than the Moody Blues' Days of Future Passed, but I hadn't heard Concerto For Group and Orchestra, so I'm just taking their word for those who heard that album).    But then they returned to rock with In Rock, with a change in direction. Even before 1970, Led Zeppelin was riding high, as everyone knows, they already managed to release two albums in 1969. In 1970 comes Black Sabbath's debut album (and later that year, Paranoid). If anyone hadn't noticed by this point (1969/'70), music was getting heavier than ever before and it was these groups that were responsible for the evolution of heavy metal. Deep Purple were obviously wanting to get in the game, and new member Ian Gillan and Roger Glover were obviously made for this new, emerging heavy metal scene. Heavy guitar riffs from Blackmore and heavily fuzzed organ from Lord were now order of the day. Gone are the harpsichords, psychedelic gimmicks, and covers of other people's songs, with a much more raw, unbridled hard rock sound. A pop-oriented song like \\"Anthem\\" (which appeared on The Book of Taliesyn) would be something the Mark II lineup would never dream of doing. The band drives home this point right away with \\"Speed King\\", with Ian Gillan's wild voice and heavy guitar riffs. In the middle, the band gets jazzy, with some great organ and guitar solos. \\"Bloodsucker\\" continues on this same hard rock vein, as is most of the rest of the album. \\"Child in Time\\" starts off as a ballad, but then in the middle the band really gets rocking. This song caused some controversy with a San Francisco psychedelic band called It's a Beautiful Day (the band responsible for \\"White Bird\\") as Purple partially borrowed for IABD's \\"Bombay Calling\\" (but \\"Child in Time\\" has vocals while \\"Bombay Calling\\" doesn't). That caused It's a Beautiful Day to get back at Deep Purple by recording \\"Don and Dewey\\" off their next album, Marrying Maiden (1970) which beared more than a passing resemblance to Purple's \\"Wring That Neck\\" from The Book of Taliesyn album (in fact \\"Don and Dewey\\" sounds even more similar to \\"Wring that Neck\\" than \\"Child in Time\\" did \\"Bombay Calling\\", the only difference was that \\"Don and Dewey\\" featured violin, as it was a trademark of the It's a Beautiful Day sound). For all you hard rock/metal fans, if you had any doubts about Deep Purple with the Mark I lineup, all doubts were obviously thrown out the window with the Mark II lineup and In Rock. This album did not spawn any hits, unlike this lineup's best known song, \\"Smoke on the Water\\" off Machine Head. But then it don't matter as long as the music is great. All Deep Purple fans are going to need this album.
B00000272N|2.0|There are two very good songs on this album: Man In A Box (duh) and Love, Hate, Love. The slow-brewing intensity of the latter song sets it apart from the straight-up metal of the rest of the album. I really liked AIC back in the day and think both Cantrell and Staley are great talents, but I could never get into this album. Dirt, Sap, and Jar of Flies are all superior to Facelift so if you're new to AIC check those works out first.
B000099T2L|1.0|\\"stone coldest justice\\" i have been readin ur reviews an you are a fool. you review all these bands that can actualy playan you give them 1 star but you give junk like this 5 stars than you act like you know what your talking about, this cd is terrible.
B000002B2X|4.0|This EP is a very good display of Alice In Chains' musical talent. I remember back in the early '90s being blown away by the quiet power of this small collection of acoustic songs. \\"Got Me Wrong\\" is an unquestionably catchy number with its slinky baseline groove, but the rest of the songs (other than the \\"bonus\\" track) more than hold their own contrary to what some would have you believe. What impresses me the most is the way the the voices complement each other so well. On \\"Right Turn\\" Layne, Jerry, and Chris Cornell trade off verses until the shiver-inducing bridge arrives, at which time their voices drop and they chant together like wraiths: \\"Now we're as low, as we can get\\". Great stuff. \\"Brother\\" is another effective song that utilizes Ann Wilson's powerful, shrill voice to perfection on the chorus. \\"Am I Inside\\" is pure grunge in its bleak sentiments if not its sound, with Layne's solitary voice backed only by a single, melancholy acoustic guitar. When Staley sings \\"Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free...\\" he seems to be foreshadowing his future demise at the hands of drug addiction. Great listening for a quiet evening when you want to hear some acoustic music that is not lacking for intensity.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|What a moving story! Groundbreaking! Well acted! Brilliantly directed! A marvelous adaptation of the short story writer by Annie Proulx. This is what happens to people when life gives them the opportunity to explore, to desire, to remain true to their most inner needs, to become enslaved by their fears. This is what happens to people when they look back on their lives and rethink their existence, their choices, this is what happens when people have to live with their past. This goes full circle: awakening, discovering, identifying, and suffering what is at the very core of life itself. The slow pace serves as a window into the inner worlds of each character. Prepare for this film to tie your heart in a knot.
B000001ELP|3.0|ok, I bought this album after hearing my whole life that it sucks, now I know it doesnt suck but its not kiss at all, this album sounds like THe who or the rolling stones or Zepplin, which none of those bands are bad they just arent kiss and kiss isnt them, if you like rock like that this album is for you, but if your a kiss fan you will probably pass on this album the only song on here thats sounds like kiss is of course mister frehleys contribution, \\"Dark Light\\" anyways, I dont care what fans say, Unmasked and Dynasty are right up kiss's alley, this however is not, kiss is good at the rock they made and they are excellent at the disco sounding music they make, wether fans want to admit it or not, the music is great pauls vocals are strong and the music has soul too it. anyways, this album paul sounds like he is trying to be and english man or something he doesnt sound like his normal self and one other thing why this album is a failure is bob ezrin is the reason, he pushed kiss to do this project and scraped all the songs they had already recorded, ace was outvoted and its funny cuase ace would have saved the band, until ezrin stuck his nose in the music again, now i will grant destroyer was awesome but ezrin and ace never got along and this is proof ace knew what the band needed and ezrin wanted to get in the way and try to prove him wrong.

0553579908|3.0|For the most part, George RR Martin's Clash of Kings continues what he started in A Game of Thrones. The key phrase being, \\"for the most part.\\" While the book is good - I never found myself avoiding it - it isn't written at the same level as the first. The solid qualities we witness in the first book are manifest in this, but not as prominently. All in all, a good sequel to book 1, but it doesn't live up to the standard he sets there. <br /> <br />My single complaint from the first book - going out of his way to keep Tyrion alive no matter what the circumstances - is again present in the sequel, but in triplicate. In the final battle scene, Tyrion is a dead man - the narrative dictates as much. Through 2 books, we see no shortage of evidence suggesting the dwarf is not the most athletically graceful person in the story. Yet, during one battle, he manages to slice an attacker's spear 3 times before then landing a fatal blow. All of this while his horse trots around his opponent. Are we expected to believe this about face in skill is reasonable within the limits of the story? For me, it's not. <br /> <br />In addition, there are too many instances where rarely spoken of (or unheard of) entities come crashing in at the last second to cause an unexpected outcome. This is generally allowable in any book (especially fantasy), if used sparingly. But Martin goes down this avenue too often, and because of this, the last 200 pages are difficult to get through. At the end, I wanted the book to be over; not because I was eager to see what happened, but because I was getting annoyed at the absurd turns in the narrative. <br /> <br />All of this would be a brief complaint, if it hadn't spanned nearly 200 pages of the story. As it stands, the abrupt turns take too much of the story's focus, which is a detriment to the narrative. I don't think this opinion is unreasonable. The series is, after all, fantasy. But it needs to exist within the realm of \\"Acceptable Believability\\" that the author establishes, and these instances do not fit, for me. Some may disagree. YMMV. <br /> <br />In the end, I did question whether or not I would bother with book 3. Now that I've had some time to digest it, I will likely pick it up. But only after some time to detox from much of what was lacking in the story. George RR Martin can put together words, and has a good imagination while managing to keep it mostly in the realm of plausibility. For that, it's surely worth picking up book 3 and seeing where he takes it from there. Granted, it's not perfect. But there's plenty here to carry your interest into a 3rd book. <br /> <br />A step back from book 1, but still worth the read.
078322804X|5.0|This is a very silly, very funny movie.  It has a great musical cast that will NEVER be duplicated again.  Buy it for no other reason than that.  It's a tribute to the music and mayhem of the 60's and 70's, to which I am proud to say that I contributed.  Sam and Dave tunes, Chaka Khan, James Cleveland, James Brown, Ray Charles, Aretha, Cab Calloway and the list goes on and on.  Buy this DVD and play it 20 years from now to see how many of those great artists you remember.  Can you see the light???  BDR-529
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is definitely one of their best, its no Blood Sugar cause thats their breakthrough album, its no Californication cause thats their comeback album, but come on, Stadium Arcadium stands alone in  its own universe and you can't compare it to any other album of theirs. Frusciante shines likes hes never shined before, displaying some of the best solos hes ever conducted...Kiedes has never sung better and while his lyrics are mediocre this time around, his melodies are Beatlesque, and definitely stand up there with By the Way. Id say this album is a lot better than all the crap i hear on the radio, thats for damn sure. Frusciantes solos are definitely his best especially on \\"Turn it Again\\" and \\"Charlie\\", although my favorite solo by him is from \\"I Could Have Lied\\". \\"Animal Bar\\" is crazy good, Frusciante makes that Dolphin sound with the tremelo and slide....I could go on forever on how great this album is, and it took me at least 2 times to hear it from every angle..just give it more time, it will grow on you. Red Hot Chili Peppers.....I love you guys and can't wait til the next album. Keep rockin

B00005KHJM|4.0|Edward Woodward playing a prim police sergeant Howie flies in by seaplane to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl in the bizarre tale penned by Anthony Shaffer, \\"The Wicker Man\\".<br /><br />The inhabitants of the island including the girl's mother disavow any knowledge of her existence and are anything but forthcoming to Woodward.  A pious and devout Christian, Woodward is shocked by the pagan beliefs and practices followed by the inhabitants.  Fertlity rites, and sexual debauchery are apparently condoned and orchestrated by the head island honcho, Lord Summerisle played by the creepy Christopher Lee.<br /><br />During Woodward's probe he surmises that the disappearance has to do with the agrarian island's harvest.  He arrives at the commencement of May Day festivities which are held in high esteem by the locals.  In a weird scene Woodward who is sleeping in the local inn rebuffs the sexual advances of a comely and nude Britt Ekland, playing Willow, the innkeeper's daughter proclaiming his faithfulness to his fiance.<br /><br />In a unlikely twist we learn that Woodward has been summoned to Summerisle but not for the reasons we think.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Talk about a whole different movie. The 40 to 50 minutes added turn Kingdom of Heaven from decent to a flat out masterpiece. You will now get more insight into each character and finally see why they were motivated to make such rash decisions that didn't make much since before. I have a feeling this version would have been up for the Best Picture Oscar if the studio didn't force Ridley to chop it up. The case is beautiful, the extras run for hours on end, and the film is finally being shown the way it was always meant to be. Believe it or not, I now think that this film is one of Ridley Scott's finest achievements. Go buy the 4 Disc Set, you'll love it.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Ang Lee, famous for making art movies that explore the human soul does it again with this heartbreaking drama of two gay cowboys in the west.

This is what a good drama film should be...and we just do not see enough of these pictures anymore.
B00000DC10|5.0|The Shape of Punk to Come is by far my favorite Refused album. It is more experimental with new sounds and instruments than the past albums. Fanning the Flames of Discontent was more straightforward hardcore punk. However, this album adds in classical instruments and styling as well as spoken word to break up the rock. The Shape definitely has a fresher sound then the past albums. <br />One of the most amazingly composed songs on the album is \\"Tannhäuser / Derivè\\", which actually sounds like a few different songs strung together. The song start with an intricate and precise violin solo by the very talented Torbjörn Näsbom, which builds with guitar and drums. After a long instrumental the song climaxes with the classic hardcore punk style commonly associated with the Refused. After a spoken section and a return to the chorus, drummer David Sandström plays a very interesting ending with a melodica, upright bass, and a violin. This section sounds particularly like something out of a classical piece. The dynamic of the different types of instruments and music makes the song very memorable. <br />\\"New Noise\\" is another favorite track on this album. It has that trademark Refused sound with blaring guitars and intense crescendos. This song has a strong and intense force, which is probably why I have heard it on action movies.  <br /> The lyrics are consistent with the other albums with topics ranging from capitalism to the tragedies of war. The band uses their diverse music to highlight their political activism.  <br /> The main thing that draws me to this album is the diversity of the music. \\"Liberation Frequency\\" and \\"Deadly Rhythm\\" feature jazzy interludes. Classical style music is laced into \\"Tannhäuser / Derivè\\" and a unique slow, emotional sound is featured on \\"The Apollo Programme Was A Hoax.\\" Some tracks even have electronica and techno. The music switches frequently between sounds, making it exciting and more interesting.  <br /> It is hard to compare any other band to Refused because they have such a variety of sounds. I really could not even place them into a type of music. If you like The Shape of Punk to Come, I suggest you check out their new album the Refused Are F*cking Dead. It is the last recording before the band broke up.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|A reviewer recently posted on this Amazon discussion board, saying that she is bored by this amazing film. Even in today's society when people are driven to excel in their intelligence, it is a wonder that such idiotic remark still exist. Therefore, I feel compiled to give this individual a wake up call so that she can keep up with the world    This reviewer, obviously, is looking at every movie like an action movie. The misfortune of the two characters, and their fate, caused by a propaganda driven society, and the love and affection shared by the two men obviously meant nothing to this reviewer. The pain, the delicacy, and the plot, also, become a bore to this individual. This reminds me of my literature professor a few years back when he said that \\"the greatest works in literature can only be appreciated by the intelligent.\\"    Worst, this reviewer is showing classic sign of a brain so blasted by rock music that she cannot appreciate the level of sensations expressed by the music. The soft touch of the acoustic guitar triggers a bitter sweet feeling, and expressed the scenery as if the music itself is painting a picture. Of course, this means nothing to a senseless brain.    The worst felony this reviewer committed, however, is her criticism in the acting skills in this movie. Obviously, the characters of this movie demand that the actors and actresses these qualities, which is very well done. I have no idea why someone would feel that this film is poorly acted, except if the opinion of someone who has been numbed by modern day action movies.    The review, alone, shows that the reviewer is a self righteous, brain dead person with inferior intelligence from the level of this movie. This can be seen when she said that she read about 1000 reviews, when there are only around 800, and that 20% is written by the same person, suggesting that around 160 reviews are written by the same person. Totally ignoring how the theory is not plausible, but I digress.
0689865384|4.0|Scott Westerfeld's _The Uglies_ shows a true departure from the formula utilized by the majority of today's sci-fi authors. It is an easy read, by way of its well-crafted simplicity, but does not follow the hero or technology-as-man's-savior formulae. In these ways this story varies from the two sci-fi extremes of \\"pulp\\" and whatever you want to call the more elitist brands of science fiction.<br /><br />An active read, with \\"tricks\\" pulled against the post-operative \\"Pretties\\" consuming a good deal of the book, the real treasure is found in the book's very direct social criticism. The brains vs. beauty arguments that are constantly in the view of America's public have been vicious in the past, particularly when dealing with bulimia, anorexia, and sexism. Westerfeld addresses, not these issues, but the society that spawns and lives both sides of the argument in question. Frankly, Westerfeld has written the best social commentary effected in science fiction of the decade. Considering that social commentary was one of the first uses, and has remained the predominant use for science fiction, this is an admirable achievement.<br /><br />Westerfeld's first, predominant, and most obvious criticism is directed towards the social machine supporting the concept that the beauty of the human body is a necessity for success in life. He demonstrates through exaggeration the influence this idea wields from kindergarten to the retirement home. Though exaggerated, the system used by the authoritarian power structure in his book closely parallels the current social indoctrination that occurs from the first time a girl in kindergarten thinks her shoes aren't as nice as those worn by other girls in her class, through the high-schooler who is sure his girl-friend left him because his muscles were too small or his nose was too big, to the retirees whispering that the makeup their acquaintance is being buried in is not so nice as their friend's from the funeral two months ago. These things happen. We are pressed together, forced to dress alike at work, to behave alike by teachers in high-school, to respond to thoughtfully farcical questions alike in college or university, to retire at the same age, to yearn for the same cars, picket fences, and portfolios as everyone else. In Westerfeld's book, legally mandated, and near universally desired, surgery makes this pressure almost entirely successful, at the expense of the creativity and richness of life that diversity, imagination, and psychological freedom engender.<br /><br />The second criticism comes near the end of the book. This critical lance is directed at many of the reactionaries who attempt to combat the societal tendency to press for physical beauty to the detriment of society at large. As Westerfeld's plot reveals a potential cure for the lesions formed on the brain during the beautifying surgery mandated by the city-state's government, a \\"Pretty\\" flatly refuses the potentially healing medication. Westerfeld's point to the mind over body reactionaries is sharp, indeed. You cannot, by force, fight this social pressure to follow societal templates or you will, in the end, be just as guilty of psychological hijacking as the social machine you denounce. The ends, he infers, do not justify the means. Questions remain unanswered, and the book ends abruptly, as, in one long-chaptered entry into his world, Westerfeld shows us that there are more than two sides to every argument.gs happen.

B000E33VWW|5.0|I can only provide you with my personal reactions and interpretations of this film.  The intentions of the authors, director, and actors are unknown to me, but what I saw on the screen affected me quite powerfully.  For me, this quiet intenisty is exactly what I most like in film.  One of the things an author must do is see.  To write truthfully an author cannot blink or look away or distract by making sensational effects.  Think of the scene of Capote alone in the funeral parlor with the closed coffins containing the bodies of the family.  Does the author look inside or does his respect and sense of decorum keep the lids closed.  There is not a simple answer or act for anyone of sensitivity.<br /><br />This movie is much like that.  The pictures it shows us are clean, spare, and give us time to look at and into what is going on.  In this movie, facial expressions matter a great deal.  A movement of an eyebrow, a flicker of an emotion that escapes and is then suppressed communicates so much.  Am I reading meaning into the performances?  Maybe.  But the movie gives me the opportunity to see and, well, luxuriate in thought about what is happening inside these people.<br /><br />Of course, the movie is about Capote and he is on the screen nearly constantly.  Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is so intelligent, so powerfully imaginative, and communicates so continually that I can almost not understand how he accomplished it.  Capote is an immensely complex character.  We see his public bravado and understand its balance with his private insecurities.  However, there is not a simple relationship between the two.  One isn't the cause of the other.<br /><br />Capote is completely able to tell a truth with a lie and then to lie with telling the truth.  We see him genuinely ache for the killer Perry Smith while still manipulating him to get what he wants.  When Capote gets a real and serious lawyer for the killers he may allow himself to feel that he is doing it out of compassion for these men and the fellowship he feels for Smith because of their shared childhood abandonment.  Yet, Capote also knows that he needs to keep them alive long enough to extract their stories and get at the truth so he can write his book.<br /><br />For me, the most amazing scenes in the film are Capote's private exchanges with Smith (and great credit has to be given to Clifton Collins, Jr for his contributions to these scenes).  Capote uses genuine emotion to charismatically pull in Smith.  At other times, he creates a negative emotional pressure that almost forces the emotion within Smith to come out and fill it.  Another time Capote will user superiority and near contempt to manipulate the needy child in Smith.  Yet, in the end, Capote is caught in his own trap.  Capote has to finish his book and for him to do that they murderers need to die.  Yet, Capote's getting them lawyers started them down the path of appeal after appeal and stay after stay.  Finally, Capote has to withdraw any more assistance for Hickock and Smith.  Yet, in abandoning them his own conscience burns and all but destroys him.  When you see his life after \\"In Cold Blood\\" one could make the argument that it did him in.<br /><br />Of course, Hoffman's fabulous performance could not exist without other great artists to perform with.  The entire cast of this movie is just wonderful.  Catherine Keener as Harper Lee is perfect as Capote's friend who knows him for what he really is and loves him anyway, but not to the point of self-deception.  Bob Balaban is wonderful and knowing as, William Shawn, the legendary editor of the New Yorker.  He also knows how to manage and manipulate Capote, but is also drawn into this final miserable web of the execution.  Bruce Greenwood's sensitive portrayal of Capote's closest love, Jack Dunphy, allows us to see that as self-involved and capable of hurting others as Capote was, at the extremes he did need another and that was Dunphy.  Chris Cooper and AmyRyan add so much as the Kansas detective and his wife who are both taken in by Capote's charisma and fame while the detective retrains some distance and skepticism of Capote's ultimate motivation.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is also wonderful and I praise this movie without reservation.<br /><br />The \\"R\\" rating comes from some profane language (not a lot) and a brief scene of brutality and blood when the murders are finally recounted.tive and his wife who are both taken in by Capote's charisma and fame while the detective retrains some distance and skepticism of Capote's ultimate motivation.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|the best way i can describe this album is to say that it is a perfect album to play on a sunday afternoon, with the windows open and a gentle breeze blowing in while dozing on the couch.  and that's not to imply that it's boring in any way.  but it is very mellow.  there are hints of floyd here, but minus the angst, anger and harder edges. this album has a very smooth flow and is excellently produced.  it's hard to compare it to anything else.  it's somewhat unfair, but may be helpful, to say, this is floyd light (pink floyd at it's most mellow).  i say unfair because it's a unique album with it's own sound and gilmoure shouldn't have to have to be burdened with floyd comparisons for the rest of his life.  get the album if you want to chill out and have something to relax to on a breezy summer day, preferably next to a beach...
0385486804|4.0|Author Jonathan Krakauer brings his gripping style to the tragic case of Christopher McCandless.  After graduating from college, McCandless gave his money to charity, cut ties with his affluent family, and hitchhiked to Alaska in search of a more stark life.  Perhaps the oddest thing was not that young McCandless rejected convention, but the vehemence with which he was determined to live alone in the Alaskan wilderness.  Krakauer does an excellent job describing McCandless' life in the wilds - drawing heavily on the young man's diary.  We see how he lived there, and how he died in the stark and unforgiving wilderness, perhaps as a result of having eaten toxic seed pods.  While Krakauer cannot be 100 percent certain of every fact, he does his best, and the result is engrossing and believable.  Krakauer also parallel's McCandless' sojourn to the author's own solo climb of Devil's Thumb (a mountain on the Alaska- Canadian border) in a dangerous act of youthful rebellion.    <br /> <br />This book doesn't quite match the author's gripping account of disaster on Mount Everest (INTO THIN AIR) but it is a clear, moving, and readable narrative.         <br />
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Non-Anamorphic Widescreen?<br /><br />I think I'll just watch my old VHS tapes.  What's the point of a DVD release that ignores the technical specs of the format?  We're not talking about cleaning up or restoring the print itself, just formatting the DVD image for today's televisions. On my TV, this DVD is going to have a picture that is stretched and distorted horizontally, making every single character look as fat as Jabba the Hutt. Inexcusable!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've written a full review of this album elsewhere.  All that remains to be said, at least for those who feel that they have been somehow let down by 10,000 Days, is that they should trade-in their ears for new ones.  It stands as a brooding, slow-burn CD that takes time to appreciate.  It is not as forthright as Lateralus (although it shares the same tone in parts) and is far more grown-up than Aenima.  Someone else compared it to a concept album and I would partly agree.  It demands that you find a quiet space, maybe in the dark, and then follow it.  Those with MTV length attention spans need not apply. <br /> <br />However, as I happen to love Sunn O))), then what do I know?  After 30 years spent listening to lauded music since I was old enough to appreciate it, then maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about.  What do you think, kiddies?  Should I swap for some QOTSA albums instead? <br /> <br />
B00008AWOD|5.0|A problem with the music industry today is that artists are portrayed - both by the media and through their music - as being larger than life. This image can often create a barrier to the listener when hearing their music, which stops them from connecting properly with the emotions being evoked. The beauty of \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" lies in Placebo's ability to remove this metaphorical barrier and expose the listener to the full impact of the emotions being evoked. Listening to \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" is an experience I find to be akin to talking with a close friend, in that the band make no attempt to salvage the \\"rock star\\" image amidst the tender, unpretentious beauty on offer. <br /> <br />Many people would be fast to label Placebo as an indie or pop-rock act, but personally I see them as a more progressive band. Their quietly hypnotic quality feels to me closely reminiscient of Pink Floyd. Part of Placebo's capability to really closely connect with the listener actually stems, I feel, from their musical simplicity. The guitar and drum lines on offer are far from being technically complex, but they do have an ambient flow to them which promotes the soothing nature of the music. Brian Molko's voice is also not what would be traditionally considered \\"beautiful\\". On the contrary it's actually quite nasal, and if it were used in the wrong way would certainly fall on the wrong side of annoying. However, in the way his vocal lines glide gracefully over the music, they too adopt a quietly ambient hue. A few piano lines thrown in here and there don't hurt either; in fact, they give the album a new layer and serve to magnify the experience. <br /> <br />The song structures too, play a large role in creating \\"Sleeping With Ghosts'\\" hypnotic atmosphere. Most often they start out with a normal verse/chorus/verse/chorus structure, but as the song gains momentum, this structure is abandonned for an uninterupted flow at a fixed tempo. However, this transition is managed so smoothly that you'll hardly notice it until the song is nearly finished. You'll often find Brian Molko repeating the same line over and over (not irritating at all, surprisingly). It's easy to lose yourself in the graceful, hypnotic tunes and end up drifting away. What's even more impressive is that this structure never gets old, as is is fitted to each song's individual style. <br /> <br />The production too, plays a small role in creating this work of art. The guitars are in no way produced to be loud or raucous and thus their soothing quality remains untainted, while the drums are just loud enough to give the music backbone, while not so loud as to be obtrusive. If any fault is to be found, I would say that Brian Molko's voice sits too highly in the mix. If his voice was a little quieter and given a bit of reverb, it could have a distant quality (akin to Garm's on Ulver's album \\"Bergtatt\\") which would have made the music even more ambient. However, in the grand scheme of things this is a small complaint. <br /> <br />So, if you've read this far you already know what my verdict is: \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" is a masterwork, possibly the best piece of alternative music to grace our world for years. It offers us something genuinely rare; a chance to sit down for 46 minutes and visit a place inside our own heads where all of our rushed, hectic lifestyle ceases to exist. <br /> <br />
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|The year 2005 proved to be a great year for GLBT themed films receiving critical success, especially the Oscars.  \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" and \\"Capote\\" are other films note this greatly not just because of their superior film quality.  But because they push barriers that few past filmmakers have dared.  Many have been afraid of this because of fear that their careers will end.  In fact, they have been known to heighten some careers.  \\"Transamerica\\" is no acception to any of this.   <br />  <br />\\"Transamerica\\" follows the story of Bree Osbourne, a transsexual woman about to receive the sexual reassessment surgery, who discovers more about herself than she ever imagined.  Her road trip begins when she discovers she has a seventeen year old son Toby, conceived while she still identified as Stanley, who she must bail out of jail.  This begins in New York and ends in Los Angeles.  Through this trail, Bree and Toby reveal secrets about one another that change their lives forever.  Bree slowly realizes that other issues besides her sex organs haunt her.  This leads to realizing their need for acceptance for another. <br /> <br />Despite the film title, \\"Transamerica\\" does not explore transsexuality as much as it may imply.  This is more of a film about acceptance, family, friends, and love.  It stars Emmy and Golden Globe winner Felicity Huffman (\\"Desperate Housewives\\"), Kevin Zegers, Fionula Flanagan, and Oscar nominee Burt Young (\\"Rocky\\").  The cast and crew create a beautiful masterpiece that follows the similar idea of past masterpieces \\"The Trip To Bountiful\\" (1985) and \\"Stand By Me\\" (1985).  However they add issues that few past films have accomplished so well.  Unlike past trans-issue films like \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" (1999), they combine multiple storyline plots.  \\"Transamerica\\" created characters that stand out not as their biology or their actions but as human beings living day to day. <br /> <br />Through these chain of events, the storyline keeps the emotional value flowing greatly.  The people that Bree and Toby meet keep this film flowing wonderfully while maintaining the theme of Bree and Toby finding themselves.  Despite this being more of revelation film, it fits some educational pieces without losing the theme.  They couldn't have been placed in any better scenes, especially when Bree describes her college studies of transsexuality in evolution.  Every word placed in the film proves that the writers researched these issues thoroughly for an accurate and well-crafted despliction.  More amazing is that within the film, including the DVD cover and the special features, they never label Bree as a man living as a woman.  They use their pronouns exactly as they should where many in society are quick to say he/ she, it, or he.  They portray her as a true woman, whom she is. <br /> <br />This film received several award wins and nominations, the most noticeable being Felicity Huffman for Best Actress (Oscar nomination and Golden Globe win).  Her performance was one of the best of 2005 as Bree.  Some may be quick to judge that only her success on ABC's \\"Desperate Housewives\\" catipulted her nominations.  Her hard work proves not so.  She researched transsexual issues and her character deeply to achieve such an accurate portrayal of Bree.  From her voice to her mannerisms to her emotional struggles, this stands out as Huffman's performance of a lifetime. <br /> <br />Though the remaining cast appears briefly, besides Kevin Zegers as Toby, each of them stand out in their performance well.  Through the sensative to the non-accepting, they add their own unforgettable notes.  Their performances truly give the emotional theme necessary to express what's happening in their environment.  <br /> <br />Behind the storyline and performances is the quality that many forget, the music.  This great series of country music gives the film a great background of the road trip.  This somewhat adds to the geography's southern touch.  The performances andcompositions are beautiful.  The film ends with the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated \\"Travelin' Thru\\" by legendary artist Dolly Parton.  This true stand-out wonderfully speaks of the film in whole with uplift, gospel, and spirituality.  Viewers should expect a 2006 Grammy nomination for Best Song Written For a Film (the Grammy cut-off date is 9/30; the film and the song were released afterwards). <br /> <br />Such great film quality makes \\"Transamerica\\" great for many audiences.  This will surely continue pleasing them for a long time.  Those wanting more should also watch the special features, which feature the film making process through Huffman and Zegers' perspectives and the music video for \\"Travelin' Thru\\".  The other films listed in this review are also great recommendations.
0316172324|4.0|I used to think a lot about thinking.  I guess I'm just one of those guys.  But when I saw this book I knew it was for me.  People are always asking me how do I make such snap decisions or \\"how come you so smart\\" but the answer is in this book.  You see, as Mr. Malcolm describes, you think right AS you see and NOT after.  As you learn to apply these \\"rapid fire thought\\" techniques to your everyday life, you will be suprised.  I'm now the ass-man (assistant manager) in my office and now I'm looking at another raise.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|This follow-up spectacular to \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" is truly horrific in spots in its depiction of the fiery ends of some of the minor characters.  This is definitely not a movie for younger children as it may terrify them - but then, on the other hand give them a healthy respect for stringent fire safety. <br /> <br />The special effects are awesome and this was the era before CGI and other advanced computer techniques.  The mastery of the special effects team is admirable, to say the least, and ALL of the effects are convincing.  The miniatures are realistic and believable and the fire effects makes one wonder how all the actors got through the film without major mishap. <br /> <br />Faye Dunaway floats through her scenes in a gown that reveals everything but her nether regions and she seems to be in some sort of trance or drug-induced coma - all acting, of course.  Richard Chamberlain is convincing as a slimeball husband and subcontractor for the building of the world's tallest building and his ending is not gruesome enough for me. <br /> <br />The lead actors - Newman and McQueen - are outstanding and entirely convincing as architect and fire chief respectively.  It was quoted by one of the above that after making this movie he would never stay at a hotel or live in a condominium or apartment above the fourth floor - perhaps wise words. <br /> <br />The extras are exhaustive but really give a sense of the dedication and consummate artistry that went into the making of this ground-breaking disaster epic.  They may remake it again with a plethora of CGI effects and even more gruesome deaths by fire but this classic will never be surpassed. <br /> <br />I like the inclusion of \\"Lobby Cards\\" and an exhaustive booklet on the making of the movie plus the other extras included. <br /> <br />This movie is a tribute to the grandiose film-making talents of Irwin Allen and in his genre he equals Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br />Timothy Wingate  Ottawa  Canada
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a visually stunning and utterly charming film about love and loss and loneliness, and missed (and near-missed) opportunities. Audrey Tatou carries this film on her tiny shoulders, with a great supporting cast to help her. She is perfectly cast as Amelie, the shy, lovelorn title character who works as a waitress in a cafe and, through a series of twists of fate, decides to involve herself in changing the lives of those around her. And, in the end, changing her own life.<br /><br />Fate causes Amelie to discover a cache of long-forgotten toys, hidden in a corner of her apartment, left there by a small boy who is now an old man. This leads to the machinations of everyone's lives, from the nasty green-grocer and his sweet, simple-minded assistant, to the disabled, all-knowing man across the courtyard, to the broken-hearted concierge whose husband left her decades before, to co-workers and even her own father. But, Amelie discovers her own heart beating for the love she craves, and while guiding the lives of others, she almost forgets about her own life.<br /><br />Everything about this film is beautiful, from the cinematography, to the direction, writing, art direction and, of course, the acting. Montmartre is practically a co-star in this beautiful film. You will not think about photo booths, garden gnomes or skipping stones in quite the same way again.
B000001FI7|5.0|This is a great moody album. I love all the songs on here, no filler at all. Beth Gibbons has a very beautiful and smooth voice. This cd has a very haunting beauty to it. I have been listening  to it almost every day since I got it. \\"Numb\\" is my favorite song here. This is one of the most unique albums I have ever heard, they sound like no one and no one sounds like them. This album also has a very original use of  beats, again like nobody else. I find some of the music  disturbing at times, but in a good way, how many bands can move you in any way. This is where this whole style of music started.
1400079179|4.0|I enjoyed it.  I would recommend it.  It's fast paced reading.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Upon first listen of this album I did find myself disappointed.  I thought to myself, \\"Why all the filler?  Take away the noise/ambient tracks and you have an EP that took five years to record!\\"<br /><br />But with each listen, it gets better (like many who've stated before me).<br /><br />This isn't an album I'd recommend listening to in your vehicle (unless you're on a road trip of some sort) because you'll get through two to three tracks MAX before you reach your destination.  The first track, \\"Vicarious,\\" sounds like Lateralus-era Tool, as does the following \\"Jambi,\\" heavy in a more emotional/spiritual sense than musically.  Both tracks will take roughly fifteen minutes to get through.  Next up is \\"Wings pt I\\" which is slow, atmospheric, fairly anti-climatic (it builds into full-on drumming and guitar work like the Tool we're all used to for 15-20 seconds max out of the whole 6:11 the song stretches) and it leads into the title track, \\"10,000 Days (Wings pt 2),\\" which can be a demanding test to one's patience.  It takes approximately five minutes for the song to \\"start,\\" and roughly at nine-or-so minutes it becomes characteristically Tool.  But that only lasts a good minute, before it's Keenan in a very low voice singing over minimalist guitar strums and ambient noises.<br /><br />\\"The Pot,\\" this album's fifth track is no doubt Tool.  New and long-term fans alike will no doubt immediately recognize this, and along with the first two tracks (and \\"Right in Two\\") sums up where the `traditional' Tool we've come to know and expect lies on this record.  These four songs sound like a continuation of their last album (and are what I was referring to in my EP statement above).<br /><br />As of this writing, \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" is my favorite cut from this album, as it sounds more like something from &#508;nima (my favorite Tool album).  Like the title track, it weighs-in at just over eleven minutes long.<br /><br />If you're new to Tool, this is not the album for you.  \\"10,000 Days\\" is for the established Tool fan, and even then, with everything we've come to expect and know about the band, it will take a few listens, an even more-open mind, and plenty of time to really appreciate.  I guess my main complaint is that coming from a band that's progressed - and impressed - on each album, this album has almost too much in common with Lateralus, both the music and the artwork (granted, I like Alex Grey, but I personally don't think the band should've stuck with his work for another album).<br /><br />Basically, being a 12-track, 75+ minute album; give it 225-300 minutes of actually listening to it, and it WILL grow on you, and you will end-up enjoying it.  I didn't at first, it's not as accessible as previous material, but in the long run, it's just as enjoyable.<br /><br />Actually, now that I think of it, it reminds me a little of ISIS ... like if Tool recorded Panopticon instead of ISIS...you.  \\"10,000 Days\\" is for the established Tool fan, and even then, with everything we've come to expect and know about the band, it will take a few listens, an even more-open mind, and plenty of time to really appreciate.

B000EULJLU|4.0|3 1/2 <br /> <br />You've gotta give Tool alot of credit for creating all of this mythology and mysticism around what simply amounts to a rock band. Yes folks, four musicians on stage playing music, as human as you and I. No divinity to be found here. With each release the band dissapoints millions and appeases another million. Lateralus, upon intitial release, was dissapointing and now is considered a gothic masterpiece. Tool is in the lines of what many consider to be \\"smart\\" rock music. Music that makes you feel intellectually stimualted due to the talent of the musicians and lyrics of the singer.  <br /> <br />This reputation follows them into their latest effort which, despite the 5 year absence, only took them half a year to write and record. Maynard is back and this time its personal. Literaly he throws his guts onto the stage and unravels alot of his past lyrics by being sincere and god forbid...straight forward. Yet with all of this honesty on the forefront what has happened to the music? The record does give alot of food for thought but hidden inside the various concept songs is recycled rhythms and guitar riffs. Play Rosetta Stoned side by side with Third Eye and the similarities are disturbing. Schism and Various are long lost cousins and I think H. and The Pot were seperated at birth.   <br /> <br />Variation has eluded the four gargoyles that stand on the church balcony looking scary and menacing. And yet their is alot to chew on inside this unique packaging. Vicarious is an obvious comment on how we only pay attention when blood has been spilt. The Pot gets political and Rosetta Stoned takes us into the mind of an LSD trip gone too far. Right in Two ends the record with a strong comment on man kind as a whole. Maynard speaks with conviction as he declares us all Monkey's fighting over pieces of the ground.  <br /> <br />Experimental and derivative of past records is what you will find in these 10,000 Days. Infectious melodies and unimaginative guitarriffs are found in this 77 minute epic. Adam truly needs to go back to guitar school and be shown that more can be done outside of Drop D tuning. While you may want to declare these four gentlemen deities I must break your little bubble. Its just music.  <br /> <br />Tool does stand the test of time and I would like to add that all of the new songs are amazing when listened to live. A great record that simply could not live upto the expectations of a rabid fan base that cannot be satisfied.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000256KE|5.0|When looking at the progress of what was then a new band (headed by a new artist, Bryan Ferry) the assessment presents a trade-off: Roxy as a band had by this time played a number of tours together, with a settled bass player (the first album had, if memory serves, two bassists on it) and had ceased to sound like a group of studio musicians who were backing the singer songwriter Ferry.<br />  On the other hand, the first Roxy album was so unusial, between the sound of Ferry's voice, his crafty-campy style of songwriting, and Brian Eno's strange sound sheets, that there just wasn't anything else out there in 1972 that sounded even remotely like it. The first Roxy album was very much the proverbial breath of fresh air.<br />  This second Roxy album, while still a set of oustanding songs, sounds more conventional, as Ferry goes a little more to the classic Rock 'n' Roll ethos, and the album's songs are suggestive of other people- like Chuck Berry or Eddie Cochrane or the Rolling Stones or anguished Gospellers in Black churches in southern America. The strange edge is still there, has to be because Brian Eno is still in the group. But his presence is not so deeply felt on each song of this album, unlike the first where the spectre of Eno could be heard from first to last. There is one song that has the markings of the first album, the bizarre \\"In Every Dream Home a Heart Ache\\" the lyrics of which devolve from suburban melancholy to object fixations (or Ferry imagening a sexual triste with an inflatable doll). But the track abrubtly breaks out of this murmering grey dirge with a heavy burst befitting Led Zeppelin.<br />  The peak of this album is the extended work out track known as \\"Bogus Man.\\" Eno makes his most definate contribution to the album here, and the progress of the band as a playing club is again demonstrated to impressive results. The album is still wonderful, interesting, and eminently entertaining; and while it might be a five star for most any other group of the time (like the then critically overated \\"Stories\\") for Roxy their great masterpiece was still ahead of them, (\\"Stranded\\") and the loss of Brian Eno and the gain of Eddie Jobson.p of the time (like the then critically overated \\"Stories\\") for Roxy their great masterpiece was still ahead of them, (\\"Stranded\\") and the loss of Brian Eno and the gain of Eddie Jobson.

0618477942|5.0|How a graphic novel should be- once you finish your first reading, your relationship with it has just begun. It's after all a 'picture book' you can devour it in one night if you receive it in the mail by six pm and finish at three am, especially if you have a dictionary handy, ideally one that is large and musty. The book is like a poem you could read quickly, a painting you might stop flat to admire and then walk by, but closer examination reveals layers of complexity and enjoyment.  Its richness is in the explication.  I would think about this book on the subway and open it back up to revisit parts when I got home; now I carry it.  Parts of it are oblique on the first reading; I got the distinct idea that Bechdel, whose parents were English teachers, wants her audience to experience the frustration followed by satisfaction of having to look up big words.  (You know how people liked the Da Vinci code because it makes you feel vicariously cultured?) It's also fitting that this book is a candid explication of her youth, going back to revisit darker things she didn't understand at the time; it's admirable and troubling, and raises thoughts about the relationship between talent and adversity.  And it is so aesthetically pleasing.  Bechdel's characters' faces are perfectly expressive and she is particularly talented at portraying kids- cuteness approaching Japanese levels, but genuine and unsaccharine and with a clear memory of the demons of childhood.  If you want to see the great short story comic that started this book, you have to pick up \\"The Indelible Alison Bechdel\\".  It's very cool to see how that coming-out story is refined and progressed in Fun Home's less cartoony version that is still humorous in its pathos.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Fernando Meirelles's take on the John Le Carre novel is a study of corruption and a study of true love all at once. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes give solid and powerful performances with great written characters that are human in a realistic way that does not insult the audience. Weisz is superb and captivating as a human rights worker who is willing to do almost anything to protect the people around her and Fiennes is tender and strong will as a man who must find the courage in himself to right a wrong and fight a huge injustice. Fernando Meirelles serves all of them well with a visual look a place that is really not seen too much in films and the landscape of Africa has never looked better anywhere in another film. <br /> <br />This is a great movie and I was crying towards the end. That's how great it really was. <br /> <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|David Bowie has just teamed up with the Pixies and gone back in time to 16th century and used whatever instruments they can lift from the nearest King's banquet hall to bang together what has to be heard to be believed. Given that this is the 21st Century maybe T-Rex heads will be impressed by the revival that... dare I say the dreaded term \\"glam-rock\\" has just got with Funeral. But the point is that this is an album for any collection. It is one of those. Just listen to Neighbourhood #2. Your sold on it alone.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Seriously mishandled horror thriller that had some of its chips in the right place but lacks the showmanship to pull it off. Keanu Reeves is a charismatic actor but his performance here misses the mark completely and noises dives into a brick wall. His performance lacks the presence that the character needs to make this story fly and that's a dangerous thing considering the fact that he's the lead in the film. The story itself makes no sense what so ever and the direction by Frances Lawrence is amateurish to say the least. By hearing the audio commentary by him on the DVD is to here a filmmaker who knows that he was in way over his head in directing this film and it shows by his bad decision making and his clear misunderstanding on what the movie really needed by his lack of experience. He copies more than he originates and lacks the understanding to know how to incorporate what he copied. Another factor that made this movie fail is the screenplay, that had no idea on what it was trying to say. It says one thing and then does a complete 360 degrees and does something completely different. It tries to be intelligent but can't hide the fact that it's really trying to make a supernatural dirty harry film that lacks brains competence, and good writing. Its was supposed to be another Keanu Reeves franchise but unfortunately it makes the last two really bad matrix movies look like cinematic art. <br /> <br />There are some good performances in this film that does try to respect the audience, and that's manly from Rachel Weisz (The Shape of Things, The Constant Gardener) who gives the only real and strong performance in the entire film. Her performance is way too good for this film, that's how powerful an actress she is and it deserved better than this. The next good performance belongs to Peter Stormare (Fargo, The Brothers Grim, the show Prison Break) whose interpretation of the devil is pretty inventive but he's only in the last eight minutes in the film. <br />

Follow her as she enters on a death-defying journey through the seedy underbelly of post-Cold War Paris, where she haunts sex shops by night and wanders the streets stalking an innocent boy named Nino, a drug addict and loner who works in the underground Parisian sex industry.  Amelie, a chronic liar and psychopath, breaks into people's apartments and decieves them, playing cruel tricks that will make you want to hate her.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|As a professional movie critic, I have watched dozens of movies, and never has a movie stood out like Brokeback Mountain. I remember when a Christian activist called my office, and practically yelled at the top of his lungs over the phone because I commented a \\"movie that promote a Gay lifestyle\\" as the best movie in the 21st century. After watching couple more movies produced after Brokeback Mountain, including the best picture winner, Crash, I still stand by my statement.    90% of movies today rely on actors/actresses pulling stunts on screens that distract viewers from the fact that the movie has no story line. Around 9% has directors that put dull themes into dramatic movies, as in the case of \\"Hulk\\" when the director is able to transform a simple comic book to a movie with emotion, drama, and ideas. Brokeback Mountain belongs to that unique 1% of the movies where a short story from one of the best authors the world ever witnessed is combined with the spirit of the director, and acted out by actors and actresses who, despite being pop performers and show off their athletic abilities and appearance on screen, is able to put aside all that distraction, and carry out the dram flawlessly. To me, this is what all movies should be like.    I have no idea why this amazing film did not win the Best Picture of the Year. I suspect that the Oscar board probably received the phone call I received from various Christian groups. It's sad that, even in the 21st century, people are still propaganda driven, and close minded. But whatever controversy surrounds this movie, its very existence marked the beginning of a new journey for humanity.    Thank you, Ms. Anne Proulx, Mr. Ang Lee, and the actors and actresses of Brokeback Mountain, for creating this masterpiece.
B000A7Q2DM|2.0|Obviously when a band releases their sophmore album people immediately compare it to the first one. I will do that in a minute. In situations like these, I try and hear the new album as independant so I don't develop a biased opinion. This album is good, but it is nothing too special. It has a hint of progressive rock that is overshadowed more by its \\"mainstreamish\\" pop sound; WHEREAS the first album had a more futuristic, original sound. I honestly liked the band better on that album, even though it wasn't really a \\"band\\" persay. This album just lacks the originality I like to hear and has been robbed of the credibility on the s/t release. I'd say it is above Fall Out Boy, but way below Tool on terms of originality. And I am in no way literally comparing these bands so I don't want to hear anyone bitching, but 30STM would be closer to Fall Out Boy on the spectrum than Tool.
B00000JTB2|5.0|I heard the song, \\"Don't Lie To Me\\" on a local blues station one night and was blown away.  I don't typically write reviews, but this album is superb.  I will boldly state that I think Albert King is better than B.B. King, and I am not alone in this belief.  Stevie Ray Vaughn and Albert King create magic on this album.  I enjoy Albert's playing so much that I typically skip past the SRV song (second song on the album) and continue on with Albert.  Do NOT miss out on the enjoyment this album will give you.  The sound quality is absolutely top notch, and the songs are great.  Buy it and enjoy!
B0000C9JFO|5.0|I watched L'Auberge Espagnole on a flight home from the east coast, and literally laughed outloud at some scenes. No, it's definitely not an Audrey Tautou movie (though she plays a small supporting role). But it is a wonderful movie about that transition in life -- when we finally realize who we are and what we want.<br /><br />In this case, an apartment in Barcelona provides the real melting pot of personalities and ideals, all mixing together to help Xavier find himself. Thoroughly enjoyable.
0307277674|5.0|The book was excellent and definitely worth the hype. I truly had a difficult time putting it down for the past 12 days. The chapters are short and you feel like you're making progress in a 450 page book.<br /><br />On a different note, it's frustrating that these one star reviewers bash the novel claiming it twists the truth. This is a work of FICTION. I agree that it mixes true facts with fiction and can/will confuse the mind of an \\"young\\" Christian. However, it is a story. Write a review about the book, the story told within it, and the twists and turns it takes instead of taking the defensive route on what you believe spiritually.
B000002MUN|5.0|I couldn't disagree more with Geoffrey Himes'review of Wildflowers (or for that matter, his assessment of George Harrison as a solo act).  While certain tracks on Wildflowers appeal to the introspective and slightly sentimental, anyone who has been to a Tom Petty concert and experienced the crowd response to \\"You Wreck Me,\\" would know that his rock & roll instinct is still completely intact and powerful. As a long-time Petty fan, Wildflowers stands out as my favorite work-if I could give it 6 stars, I would!
B000F0UV0E|3.0|Beachcombing should be pointless and meaningless, relaxing and even boring, but that doesn't mean music should be. If you've got to have something that's on some chart then get it, but you might want to get another chart instead. Three stars because Knopfler can still play a bit.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|First off let me say this, this movie was meant to bring closure to the game.  In a movie like that you shouldn't expect tons of character development.<br /><br />I thought the action scenes were fantastic, very well choreographed. There were many jaw dropping moments. It is true it is very fast paced, but if you watch it twice or don't sit miles away you can catch it all.<br /><br />Also i've never actually played the game, but I plan on playing it now that I saw the movie.  There is a nice feature on the dvd for those who haven't played the game.  Basically it will run through all the dialog scenes in the game and give you the gist of the story.  Also lets you see some of the key scenes and understand the importance of them.<br /><br />In the end, this movie is easily the best cgi flick i've ever seen.  I've watched it about 10 times so far and will continue to watch.  I could only wish that other companies would take the time and dedication to their fans to come out with a movie like this.
B00008BXJG|1.0|AC/DC are one of the most overrated bands out of the 70's. They only made 2 decent songs in 'highway to hell' and 'walk all over you'. the lead singer bon scott just screams. And I just dont know why people like this band. they are just as overrated as led zeppelin and the rolling stones. ignore the 5 star reviewers for this disaster and buy any dire straits, tom petty, green day, guns n' roses, nirvana, or neil young insted.
B000E5N62U|3.0|Have the utmost respect for Mr. Fagan and thoroughly enjoy the Steely Dan catalog and his prior solo discs, especially Kamakiriad.  Unfortunately, Morph is not up to the usual standard of Fagan excellence.  While most of the songs find a good groove, they are generally too long and tedious by their conclusion.  For example, the title track, with reprise, clocks in at over 9 minutes (the whole Gaucho CD is 38 minutes).  While his voice remains distictive, it sounds digitally enhanced at the upper end.  Also, the drumming is unusually bland.  Finally, the lyrics don't jump out and grab me.  That said, there are some infectious and memorable tracks worth a couple of spins.  Recommend primarily for the serious Fagan fan or completist.
B00005JGAB|3.0|The Ramones aren't a punk band. They are a hard rock heavy metal band. And all the songs on this album are heavy metal style. Joey <br />Ramone still sings the same voice though Johnny Ramone plays electric heavy metal guitar. The ramones always were a rock and roll band just like these metal bands GUNS N ROSES NIRVANA SCORPIONS AND METALLICA. <br /> <br />ramones play metal ramones play metal ramones play metal ramones play metal.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|If you are stuck on a calm, quiet island with David Gilmour and his guitars, this is what you might expect.  His voice is smooth and soothing.  The guitar playing is crisp and distinctive.  Melodies are light and breezy.  Overall, this disc is a nice listen with pristine production and very nice packaging.  But, if you want propulsive percussion, or a heavy guitar riff, or thought provoking lyrics, then maybe you should look elsewhere.  Recommend only to those who will enjoy his mellow soundscape.
B000002J09|1.0|Led zeppelin iv is one of the most overrated albums of all time. They only made 3 decent songs in 'Stairway to heaven', 'kashmir', <br />and rock and roll. But the rest of them, no no because I hear them all the time on the radio. Stay away from most of the overrated led zeppelin albums and any album from the rolling stones and bads who suck. and one more thing, I'm glad they <br />aren't around anymore. <br /> <br />hahahahahahahhahahah!!!!!!
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I can't believe people these days, nor can I believe these magazines telling everyone this is a return to \\"the Pearl Jam of Yore\\" CD and all the past years are finally paying off. What a load of Ca-ca. Riot act was their weakest cd (but it still contained a few classics), I'll admit, but this, come on now lets get some sense. The lyrics are on the nod, the guitars have lost the edge, and Eddie doesn't seem to be in love. I don't want to waste your time complaining but true fans most likely will be in tears over this one, wondering \\"is this the end of their road?\\" Yield, No Code, Ten, Vs., and Binaural are true grunge classics in every sense. For me and everyone I know, the more experimental they became, the more they continued to kick ass. Now everyone is saying this is their return!! Amazing. In my opinion, it's their biggest step backward. It isn't the worst album in the world though, and I would buy it again if I had to. I just want to warn all the true heads to not believe the hype or you'll be disappointed like I was. I was listening for another Ten yet found a 3. Go see them live and you won't be disappointed!!!!
B000002R4R|3.0|3 1/2 stars <br /> <br /> <br />Amazing instrumental prowess as expected, although the compositions are sub par for this bands standards..Often the uninspired psychadelic meanderings mire the meat and potatoes of this disc, which is not a whole lot when used to dealing with the insanely high standards of the band. Still, the spirit of Soft Machine remains intact enough to continue to enthrall at certain points of jamming bliss, although sadly of a lesser order.
B000E6UWE4|2.0|So I started reading, \\"Deadhouse Gates\\" and was actually enjoying it when I discovered that it was a book 2 of an ongoing series.  I immediately put it down and rushed out to get book 1 \\"Gardens of the Moon.\\"  I was a little confused by the fact that the two stories don't focus on the same characters...but I was fine with that.  So with that knowledge...I started reading... <br /> <br />and reading... <br /> <br />and reading... <br /> <br />...and trying to figure out what was going on.  Halfway through the book, I still had little idea of what the plot was and found myself disinterested. <br /> <br />Here's the problem with this book:  Gardens of the Moon quickly introduces the reader to many different characters in a world that the reader is not familiar with.  The problem arises when the author seems to assume that the reader knows all about the world and the characters he introduces.  I didn't.  Now it is true that there are some pages in the front and back of the book that give the reader a description of the characters, such as:  \\"Fiddler, 9th Squad, Bridgeburners.\\"  Doesn't really say a lot.  Midway through the book I still had little idea of who anyone was or why they were important.   <br /> <br />Additionally, the chapters skip too fast between these characters and events to really get a good grasp of what is happening.  It was reminiscent of reading Martin's \\"Feast for Crows\\" whereupon after reading a chapter I found myself asking, \\"What was the point of that?\\"  Because the chapters skip so, I found myself not really caring or relating with any of the characters, which was a drawback for me. <br /> <br />Someone mentioned being patient while reading this book.  Yes!  Be very patient and hope you realize the moment if/when it all comes together.  Would I recommend this book?  Probably not as long as there are better versions of epic fantasy around.  While the world can be interesting, the book is just written in a way which prohibited me from finding thetrue interest in it.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|The world of pop music really needed this one: a singer/songwriter with great passion and talent along with a keen sense of how to best connect with his growing audience. The lyrics are heartfelt and wonderfully witty. The voice and piano playing are top notch. It's really in his amazing energy that he sets himself apart from all the others. For such a young life to have felt deep emotion and emerged with a sense of humor - and mystic grandeur - is a real accomplishment. Looking forward to future output from this prodigy.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|Despite being a visual effect fiesta most of the people everywhere are disapointed with the ending of the matrix series because it has an oriental type of ending where most heroes die in the end of the story like neo in the movie. <br />Most americain movies have the good guy win and live but when people came out of revolutions they felt betrayed  <br />because of that type of ending where nothing was really resolved and everything bascially ended up in a draw as far as the movies go and you end up at square one wondering what the hell went wrong with this idea!!!. Very bad way of storytelling if you ask me. <br /> <br />Smith was destroyed by Neo and basically it felt like Smith was a Virus in the matrix and Neo ended up being the Anti virus <br />and cleaned out smith out of the matrix and that was it. <br /> <br />The humans are still there the machines are still there and that is it. <br /> <br />The problem is that the machine side of the story is not explored enough in the movie and in the end it is confusing <br />because it is that big machine world that neo is going against and it feels like the machine world is using Neo to eliminate <br />a direct threat to them in the person of agent smith. <br /> <br />Yes there is other derivative products that help understand but even after looking at them and the movies you are left with a sour taste of \\"THAT\\"S IT?!!!!\\"  \\" I have just wasted that much time looking at these things to be left with that type of ending?!!!\\" <br /> <br />A lot of people are trying to make philosophy and even religion out of these movies and the way they went but there is not much to make out of it and yet so much speculation is going on because of the ending of revolutions... <br /> <br />The Warchowski Brothers took that oriental style of ending path and they have to deal with it. What Became an obsession for many is being ridiculed by as many more because all the endings or story enhancments for the movies or in follow up derivatives stuff is getting worse and worse. <br /> <br />The brothers have not really come full circle with this and they should... <br /> <br />Another trilogy? maybe...to fix things...or to make it even worse?. <br /> <br />Who knows..i would like an amercain type of ending to this mess so that i can go on with this and stop wondering at what might have happened after revolutions... <br /> <br />A great letdown for many... on another note a good coming full circle example was the Star Wars prequel, some say they are bad but at least the 3rd movie gave us a clear picture of what really happened and that part of the story was closed well and most people did not grumble over it...and that is the way the matrix series should have been done... <br /> <br />peace...
B0000696I1|5.0|I am 23 years old and have been a fan of the Ninja Turtles since I watched the first episode on Saturday mornings when I was 8 or so. I recently purchased the first two movies because I knew I loved them, but for the life of me I could not remember much about the third one. I rented it today because I had read all of these reviews saying that the third movie was terrible and I did not wish to buy it if I was going to hate it.    My first impression as the movie began was that whoever designed the faces for the turtles, as well as splinter's puppet needed some help. As mentioned several times on this site, the costumes could have used quite a bit of work. It looked a little too Jim Henson (though I love the man).    However, after only a few moments I realized that I was laughing and enjoying myself just like I did when I was a kid watching the old show. Within the first 30 minutes I realized that I liked this movie almost more than the first one. Not only did this movie have cool visuals and great japanese costumes, but this one actually had a well developed plot. I liked the new villian and thought the actor who played him did a rather good job. His personality was different from Shredder's and gave something new to the Turtle trilogy. He was even funny at times. This movie expaneded on the turtle's personalities and allowed you to get to know them better. I don't know why people complained about the characters not acting like themselves because they acted like they should as far as I am concerned.     Concerning the plot involving time travel; I enjoyed it. Its fantasy after all. The turtles are mutants, and in the first movie the turtles make some sort of phsychic connection with Splinter. The cartoon itself was filled with Sci-Fi elements if anyone cares to look. I don't think that time travel was too far fetched by any means. It also presents something new and exciting for the Turtles. This film expaned the world of the turtles beyond the sewers and New York city.    I think that one should take this movie for what it is and not concern yourself with what it is not. If you want dark and gritty, then watch Batman or the X-Men. You cannot take yourself too seriously when you are watching a movie about walking, talking, fighting mutant turtles. I loved the Turtles because not only were they heroes, but they were funny. To me, this movie had that sense of joy that the old cartoons had, and I believe this movie was well written and well done, despite the obvious flaws in the puppets and the ending being a little weak.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I`ve seen this movie 4 times in cinemas!! It`s a record for me! Ever since I watched it the first time I just haven`t been able to put it out of my mind (or my heart). The story and the people in it are just so much more than fiction! Somehow Ennis and Jack, as well as the other characters, are just as complex as \\"real\\" people. I guess that`s why this film has touched so many people! <br /> <br />I never seen such passion in a movie before, and certainly not between two men! Heath and Jake are just perfect as Ennis and Jack!! Ennis and Jack are really \\"made\\" for eachother, they have so much in common - and yet the are eachothers opposites  in many ways. Ennis is the silent type - Jack is the talkative, Ennis is down to earth - Jack is a dreamer and so on...  <br /> <br />Both are bisexual but unfortunately Ennis is much less so than Jack. Ennis`incapability to recognize (in his mind) himself as even a little bit \\"queer\\" stops him from fully accept that Jack is the one for him.  <br /> <br />Here is the tragedy of this film! Ennis refuses to go with what his heart tells him, he is just too afraid to be \\"not normal\\". Stubbornly he tries to go on with a \\"normal\\" family life after parting from Jack (after their first summer together). Ennis double life is heavy on him and makes him unhappy. Jack, one the other hand, is hurt by Ennis refusal to live with him. The greatness of their love is in the fact that they can't let go of eachother, even though the problems of their relationship hurts them. The love is stronger than the pain it causes!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|You have not seen a movie until you see this one! Heath Ledger, and Jake Gyllenhaal combined to make the best movie ever filmed.

0446679089|4.0|Convalescing in the North Fork of Long Island, NYPD cop John Corey is asked by the local police chief to look into the murder of a young couple.  The Gordons worked as scientists at Plum Island, a Government research site, on biological diseases such as Ebola and Anthrax.  Could the Gordons' have tried to sell samples of the disease to the wrong people?  Or could the answer be routed in the past, since Plum Island has a notorious history going back to the pirates who frequented it.  Corey is definitely one of the wittiest characters I've ever come across.  I love his flippant attitude.  The pirate lore was fascinating, and I was totally surprised by the plot twist toward the end of the book.  This will not be the last John Corey book I read.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|Ahh, Dark Water...a suspense film that revolves around an insipid substance people drink and bathe in daily.  See a problem already?  If there is a way to make this plot suspenseful, frightening or at least interesting, the director certainly did not discover it. <br /> <br />The film tells the story of Dahlia, a 30 something mother in the midst of a nasty divorce.  Faced with living on a reduced income, Dahlia and her predictably overmature for her age 6 year old daughter Cecelia are forced to move into a decidedly less than secure and luxurious apartment building well outside the expensive bounds of Manhattan.  The film explains this puzzling plot point away by citing the \\"great school just 2 blocks away.\\"  This is the first big pill the viewer must swallow.  We are expected to believe that this supposedly devoted and loving mother would place a good kindergarten program higher on the priority list than her daughter's immediate safety and security.  That's assuming a \\"great school\\" would even be found in such a crackhead neighborhood.  The teeny bit of backstory the film offers on Dahlia as an abused child makes this particular point even harder to believe.  (Dahlia has implied psychological abandonment issues borne from chidhood memories of her drunken mother's parental negligence and abuse.)  These issues are never really developed or explored meaningfully in the film mind you.  They are simply thrown in to the plot in dreaded flashback form, leaving the viewer to fill in the the details that would have actually added some interesting depth to Dahlia's character.  Sorry Dark Water but moroseness in and of itself does not a character make. <br /> <br />Soon after Dahlia and Cecilia arrive at the dumpy apartment building strange things begin happening.  A child's back pack is found.  The building leaks.  Pretty scary huh?  The elevator and buttons malfunction.  Ooooh, I'm getting chills just thinking about it.  The faucets occasionally spew out nasty looking waterfor no apparent reason.  I'm on the edge of my seat! <br /> <br />The building super is predictably a cranky old gank.  But he inexplicably sways back and forth between being callous and helpful to Dahlia with no rhyme or reason.  Ultimately his character proves pointless and completely unnecessary to the events in the story, especially given how much space he is given in it.  That is not to say he isn't involved in the story.  He is.  But what occurs in the story really does not at all require his presence to play out. <br />An equally shallow and pointless character is Dahlia's lawyer, who pops into scenes from time to time behaving more like a guardian angel/psychologist/marriage counselor than a legal advisor.  New York lawyers are afterall, so very prone to going above and beyond the call of duty for the destitute, slum-living, 30 something, head case mothers they represent. <br /> <br />The final undoing of the film is the tortuously slow manner in which it moves from scene to scene.  There is no arc, no real point.  Just a lot of ominous music that tells you when a suspenseful moment is around the corner and creeping about in apartments over and over again.  What little suspense is created early in the film begins to wither away proportionately as the viewer's weariness grows.  Film making 101 tells you that in order to have sustained suspense a story must have arc.  Dark Water is pure flatline from start to finish. <br /> <br />Eventually, there is a convoluted explanation for the happenings in the building and a predictable, pointless ending that I won't give away in this review.  But they are nowhere near satisfying enough to make it worth what the viewer is asked to sit through. <br /> <br />Ultimately, Dark Waters leads viewers down the primrose path to nowhere.  This film is just another in a long line of recent big studio films rushed to production with a sorely underdeveloped storyline and screenplay treatment.  Many have reviewed this film as a pretty good work within its genre.  Don't buy that.  There are many better works out there in this genre.  Dark Water is all style and no substance.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|To start with, while it's not necessary to watch the Firefly series first, I do think it's very helpful so that you have the correct (or a better) emotional context to enjoy the film. What Firefly did was create a great ensemble cast that play their roles so perfectly, I still marvel at it every time I watch an episode. I knew I was going to love it when the Pilot episode opened with Wash (the ship's pilot) playing with plastic dinosaurs while waiting for the crew to finish a 'heist.'<br /><br />Serenity extends the story and fills in some of the past. The effects are well done (it's not Lord of the Rings, but they're good and consistent with the series). There is great action. But it's the cast and their relationships that make this movie (and series) so special. It's not that the acting is Oscar quality per se, it's that the characters are so real. This is in contrast to the last three Star Wars films where the acting is so stilted and wooden, you don't care who gets killed or about anything else for that matter (note that I loved the original trilogy for the same reason as Firefly/Serenity..the way the cast chemistry worked). Humor, anger, angst, sadness...all of them ring true in the way they play off each other.<br /><br />Mal (the captain) is perfect as the ex-soldier who cares for his crew, but tolerates no challenge to his authority (but has a good sense of humor). Ron Glass does a great job as Shepard Book, it's hard not to like Kaylee the engineer and my favorite, tough guy Jayne (Alec Baldwin) who is by far the funniest character (\\"Uhhhh, I been workin' on a new plan. What say we shoot her first.\\").<br /><br />At the end of the day, that's what made this film/series so special. The characters are genuine and easy to care about. There is just that chemistry that's present in any good series/film between the cast. Every episode provided good action and comic relief. If I had to use one word to decribe the series/film, it would be \\"fun.\\"<br /><br />I own over 600 DVDs and am a pretty serious movie buff. I would rate Firefly/Serenity in the top 20 because it's just such a good ride. Don't miss this one!I own over 600 DVDs and am a pretty serious movie buff.

0792151712|5.0|I've noticed recently how various critics and the general population treat Titanic horribly with the test of time. I find it shocking how a movie that was once regarded as one of the best movies of all time has fallen ill to tons of criticisms. People seem to find it hip now days to bash Titanic and I fail to understand why. I personally find it to be the greatest movie ever made, the Academy Awards seemed to think it was a pretty damn good movie (tied for the most wins), the soundtrack and the single \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" shot to #1 Worldwide, the critics when it first came out weren't too harsh and movie-goer's truly expressed how the general population felt about Titanic with the gigantic ticket sales (3rd Worldwide with inflation, 6th in the United States with infation).    Now, however, Titanic makes the \\"overblown movie\\" list(s) from several critics, endures extreme mockery and the ridicule of anyone who actually admits to loving this film. This may be due to many wanting to be different from the norm in 1997-1999. Maybe this mentailty never went away? Or maybe it was the cheesy scene's people like to mock over and over which obviously must mean the entire movie is cheesy. However, I recently watched Titanic the other day and I'm going to say why I find it to my favorite movie of all time.     Lets start with the basics.     Titanic was authentic and historically accurate. It included more then just the love story. It had information about the lifeboats, the binoculars, how exactly it sank, the famous people aboard the ship and numerous other things. Even things such as the first-class band and their situation, what exactly was sung the last time day light hit the Titanic at the morning church gathering, increasing more speed regardless of ice warnings and many more examples were all little details included in this movie which made it far more then just a \\"love story\\". The sets, costumes, and the special affects were amazing in this movie. They basically builtan entire ship for this movie, with extreme detail to being authentic. Just watching this movie is visually amazing.     Now more indepth thoughts.     The ship Titanic itself expressed a mentally during this time period in which humans felt they could overcome Mother Nature. With the sinking of this ship it made people truly eat the words \\"Titanic is an unsinkable ship\\" and the idea that man could overcome Mother Nature.      With the character Rose a first class passenger, you are exposed to this arrogant high society. Rose also opened your eyes to the luxuries high society had and how woman were truly trapped and were seen as second-class citizens. Rose almost committing suicide helps drive home how truly horrible it must have been for woman during this time period. The dynamics between Rose and her mother also show the dynamics between how woman had to behave and in a sense how they survived in society at this time.     With the character Jack, a third class passenger you are exposed to how large the gab between the rich and poor was. How first class dogs went down to be walked on the lower decks, how it was the poor who actually built Titanic and how it was the poor who were treated truly unfair on Titanic just because of social status, which also helped express the mentality of this time.    Having these two characters meet and expose the viewer and each other to these different lifestyles helped truly put into perspective the mentality of what this time period was like. Sure, it was in a way a clich e love story, two people from different world's falling in love. But regardless of it being typical it still exposed the different classes in a way that truly made you realize how it was for people back then. Also, many things are clich e for a reason, they most of the time work and have been shown to work time and time again.     Many complain that this movie was too much about the love story between Jack and Rose and not enough about the actual ship and the facts surrounding it. However, most everyone knows the basic facts around the Titanic and this movie was created to change this.     The love story in this movie created sympathy in which you felt for Jack and Rose. It made you truly feel how the people on the Titanic were feeling at that exact moment. Families, loved ones and friends were being torn apart. Without the emotion created from this love story you wouldn't have felt nearly as sad or seriously towards what had actually happened to these people. This makes the love story important to the actual event itself because it creates a feeling of emotion, which many people lacked before seeing this film.     Knowing the facts (like the crew who was searching for the heart of the ocean did) does not mean they actually get the entire story of Titanic. However, once they heard this story it helped them understand how truly tragic this event was. So, I'm all for having this movie be a love story, because without that people wouldn't have understood the true story of Titanic.      The ending of this movie was amazing. Everything tied together.     -When Jack died. In most love stories they would have both survived and lived happily ever after, but this truly hit home the pain people felt after this shipwreck.   -When Rose actually had the necklace. This shocked me. I  also thought releasing it back to the water was cheesy but very symbolic.   -When they showed the pictures of Rose doing everything her and Jack talked about and dying warm in her bed as he said she would was a wonderful way to end it in my opinion. I don't know why but it just seemed like the perfect way to end it.   -Oh! And how Jack was waiting in the same spot he did earlier in the movie was wonderful.     Titanic did have things in it that were cheesy, like the kissing scene at the front of the boat, the drawing scene and the \\"I'm king of the world\\" scene. However these scenes's helped keep the audience drawn in regardless of their cheese factor. Also running around the ship and opening the locked gate at the last minute before they would have drowned was also cheesy. But it is a movie and you have to have suspense, and even though these things were unlikely they were still probable and made the movie entertaining.     One of the major flaws people say this movie had was the acting. I however thought it had amazing acting and I saw nothing wrong with it. Acting is something that is hard to pin-point in terms of being good or bad. I find it an easy way to attack any film. If you say the acting is bad, you cannot really \\"prove\\" to that person it was good. Acting is something that just goes to personal opinion and you cannot really change someone's mind on it. I personally give an A+ for acting and even the script. But one thing to consider is that many shots could only be done a few times or even once because of what they had to do to the sets, making it sometimes hard to get the perfect take.     Honestly, this movie had everything. Funny parts, love, death, drama and beauty. I enjoyed this movie and am proud to say it is my favorite.
B000B0WODA|4.0|To be honest, the only song I listened to from Franz Ferdinand from their previous release was \\"Take me Out\\" which I liked, but more as a 'get-hyped' song. The sound of that single was very different and fun from other music. But after listening to this new CD in it's entirety I have to say I am a true fan of their sound. Some highlights off the CD include Evil and a Heathen, which sounds mysterious at first but leads into a powerful chorus. I also enjoy the sound of Do You Want To which is very remniscent of the first Franz song I liked (Take Me Out). But the highlight of this cd has to be the shorter song \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\", which has a fun almost Beatles-esque quality. <br />I highly reccomend buying this CD.
B000000XB9|5.0|Normally greatest hits packages are only for the casual fans and omit much of a band's best work,  but in CCR's case this album contains almost all their classic, essential tracks(except for Born on the Bayou, which you've gotta buy Chronicle Vol II to get).Growing up in Louisiana in a small town during the 80's, this record was everywhere. Every one of my friends had a parent or older brother that had this album. John Fogerty is an amazing songwriter, in my opinion up there with any of the great rock songwriters of the 60's, but unfortunately does not get near the critical respect he deserves. It absolutely blew me away when I first found out that this was a San Francisco band. I had grown up believing that these guys HAD TO BE from Louisiana. They sounded like they were straight outta the swamps. To my ears, they've aged much better than other San Francisco bands. Just straight up country, blues and rockabilly without any of the late 60's trippy psychedelic flower power stuff.Some of these songs are more timely than ever, especially Fortunate Son, with all the events of the past few years. Truly timeless. This is essential listening.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What Firefly did was create a great ensemble cast that play their roles so perfectly, I still marvel at it every time I watch an episode. I knew I was going to love it when the Pilot episode opened with Wash (the ship's pilot) playing with plastic dinosaurs while waiting for the crew to finish a 'heist.' The movie 'Serenity' extends the story and fills in some of the past.<br /><br />The effects are well done (it's not Lord of the Rings, but they're good). There is great action. But it's the cast and their relationships that make this movie (and series) so special. It's not that the acting is Oscar quality per se; it's that the characters are so real. This is in contrast to the last three Star Wars films where the acting is so stilted and wooden, you don't care who gets killed or about anything else for that matter (note that I loved the original trilogy for the same reason as Firefly/Serenity..the way the cast chemistry worked). Humor, anger, angst, sadness...all of them ring true in the way they play off each other.<br /><br />Mal (the captain) is perfect as the ex-soldier who cares for his crew, but tolerates no challenge to his authority (but has a good sense of humor). Ron Glass does a great job as Shepard Book, it's hard not to like Kaylee the engineer and my favorite, tough guy Jayne (Alec Baldwin) who is by far the funniest character (\\"Uhhhh, I been workin' on a new plan. What say we shoot her first.\\").<br /><br />At the end of the day, that's what made this series so special. The characters are genuine and easy to care about. There is just that chemistry that's present in any good series/film between the cast. Every episode provided good action and comic relief. If I had to use one word to decribe the series/film, it would be \\"fun.\\" I have every episode on my Ipod (as well as Serenity) and I watch them every time I travel for business (which is fairly often).<br /><br />I own over 600 DVDs and am a pretty serious movie buff. I would rate Firefly/Serenity in the top 20 because it's just such a good ride. Don't miss this one!renity in the top 20 because it's just such a good ride. Don't miss this one!
B000E1155E|4.0|Not a bad debut, I guess I was expecting more. For a while every where I went I heard of The Arctic Monkeys, with all this hype I was expecting something fantastic. What they are to me are pretty good, I don't think they are doing anything that has not been done before, but I like most of the songs on this album, so I guess I can't complain too much. One of the magazine articles I read, compared them to the Beatles, after only one album, this is pretty premature and ridiculous. The most original aspect of this band is the lyrics they write, sometimes funny, sometimes angry, but always entertaining. All in all if you like raw power-pop kink of raunch and roll you will most likely enjoy this.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist is a story about a boy who learns about the unspoken language of the universe through various trials on his journey of self. He begins the story as a shepherd thinking only of day-to-day challenges and needs in his small world but quickly encounters a mysterious stranger, who moves him to alter his course, and to discover his destiny. This journey takes him to new lands, where he must overcome many obstacles inluding: poverty, racism and language barriers, theft, assault and near-death challenges. He also finds friends in unlikely places, learns new skills, and discovers love, and thats all before he meets the Alchemist.   The story is simple but engaging and illustrates large spiritual concepts in small, easily-digested pieces. The book talks about getting past fear and allowing discomfort in the process of trying new things. Stepping outside our routines, and our plans and our need to control, creates an opportunity for the universe to provide us with more than we had ever hoped to experience, more love, more knowledge, and more treasure. And perhaps the biggest moral of the story is that in spite of our differences, we are all animated and united by the same hand, and in our shared existence we are only many faces of one body, and that makes everything possible.  It is one of my favourite books. I carry it with me whenever I'm flying, and I've purchased several copies as gifts. This book gifts me a renewed sense of hope and trust in the unfolding of the universe, and reminds me that anything is possible, if we allow it to be. The Alchemist turned me on to Paulo Coelho, and I have since bought and enjoyed each novel that he has written.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|And that is saying a lot, believe me, as I pretty much regard Clutch's 2004 effort, \\"Blast Tyrant\\" to be a rock'n roll masterpiece, not to mention one of my all-time favorite albums, and I know that a lot of Clutch's fans feel the same way. When I first heard Robot Hive/Exodus, I was of the opinion that it was good, but not quite as good as their last release. Lately, however, this album has grown on me something fierce, and I felt compelled to write up a review to try and explain exactly why. <br /> <br />Whereas Blast Tyrant feels more direct, \\"punchier\\" if you will, Robot Hive/Exodus feels more bluesy, even gospel-tinted, by comparison. The album flows very smoothly, partially because nearly all of the songs fade from one into the next, and in part due to the fact that they simply complement each other extremely well. <br /> <br />Make no mistake, though. This is one hard rocking beast of an album, replete with Jean-Paul Gaster's jazzy drumming, Dan Maines' funky basslines, Tim Sult's fuzzy guitarwork and Neil Fallon's wonderfully weird lyrics and gravelly vocals. Indeed, Fallon displays his mastery of the microphone once more, and seems to be more comfortable with his role in the band than ever, as he slides effortlessly through the band's grooves and guides the listener through gleefully absurd apocalyptic visions, robot revolutions (and revelations), and an increasingly surreal colosseum on the song \\"Circus Maximus\\" (\\"Every time I open my window, cranes fly in to terrorize me.\\", \\"Tipping cows in fields Elysian\\", \\"Celebrities and tentacles regard the beast with two backs.\\" and so on..). You'd be hard pressed to find a cooler doomsayer anywhere. <br /> <br />And then there is the newcomer to the band, one Mick Schauer, whose understated keyboard and organ playing adds a whole new dimension to the band's sound. It's hard to picture the songs on this album working without Schauer's contributions, which lend the whole album, as well as Clutch's sound in general a new flavour and allows them explore new musical vistas. After listening to RH/E extensively, I've found myself sorely missing it when going back to their previous albums. <br /> <br />The band seems more confident on this album than ever before, and therein lies part of its charm. The songwriting feels tighter here than it has on previous albums, and there is no shortage of sublime, groove-laced hard rock passages to be found here. The standout tracks for me, aside from the two opening tracks would have to be \\"Gullah\\", \\"Pulaski Skyway\\", \\"Never Be Moved\\" and \\"10,000 Witnesses\\". I seem to be able to listen to these songs pretty much anytime, anywhere, and not get even remotely tired of them. But honestly there isn't one track on this album that I would want to skip over (the two delta blues homages at the end of the album took the longest to grow on me, but grow on me they did), and that to me is the mark of a truly great album. <br /> <br />Just about all of the songs included here are infectious to say the least. Even as someone who usually never feels inclined to sing along to anything, it is really hard to resist here. If you don't have a silly grin on your face, or at least a small smile after spinning this disc, you are beyond all hope. To put it simply, Robot Hive/Exodus is every bit Blast Tyrant's equal and, in my humble opinion, even better, as it will no doubt stay with you longer. If you like rock and roll in any way, shape or form, there simply is no excuse for not having it in your collection. <br /> <br />And yes, it has cowbell on it.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Thank you, Ridley Scott and all the powers that be for delivering a film that is a timeless masterpiece and filled with spiritual truths that still challenge the people today. This film transcends the genre by offering its viewers the opportunity to abandon currently popular stereotypes and reflect upon universal values that elevate the essence of spirit.
B000BNX3B4|1.0|The characters didn't know when to SHUT UP, and would ramble and ramble on, trying to be \\"smart\\" or insightful.  Throw in a silly aunt (duh), the sex-crazy sister, and gay friend and you have the total cliche movie, yay.  They never explained why the main character was hopelessly trying to find a new boyfriend.  Her family was mean to her as well, and meeting her father for a date, lame.  Who was he trying to be, James Bond, with all the women?  Ok, I'm rambling myself hahah....basically just a bland movie,,,,,,if you want to see the same movie, but better, rent Ten Attitudes, which chronicalizes a man's journey through ten dates, trying to find his special someone. ;)~
0385336691|5.0|Jack Reacher is back, just as punchy, just as capable. The tone is set from the first paragraph, ordering coffee in a sidewalk cafe in New York. Reacher notices a car being driven away. Next night be he approached by someone, a man who needs information on the car.  <br /> <br />Reacher is drawn into the world of covert operatives running businesses as mercenary's for hire, and into a world where the good guys might not necessarily be so good. Lane, the man running the mercenary business has had his wife kidnapped again. His first wife Anne was kidnapped and died 5 years before. Now his second wife and here daughter, Jade have been taken and the calls are coming in. Lane is determined not to call the police this time, they just messed it up last time. Instead he offers Reacher one million dollars to find them. <br /> <br />Only the sister of Lane's first wife has some information for Reacher, information which may change how Reacher views this case. <br /> <br />Child is a tidy writer, you are drawn in right from the first sentence. At times Reacher as a character can be annoyingly perfect. I must say I had a bit of a giggle when I read the blurd on the back which said \\"[Reacher] has never met a woman who said no....\\" I do wish Child would get out of this thing where he feels like Reacher has to have sex in every book. He's a great character, together, smart, calm, and a total hero. The sex stuff I find excruciatingly cliched.  <br /> <br />But apart from that, it might be standard murder mystery stuff, but it is a great read, compelling, fast-paced and real seat of your pants stuff. Packed full of details which put right there in the spot. If Lee Child doesn't know his stuff, then I am fully convinced by his complete confidence in what he is writing.
B000067J1H|1.0|Though stylish and well crafted, it would be hard to find a more disingenuous, manipulative, and hideous movie than Fight Club.  Imagine a film that showed beautiful people eating a fabulous, decadent meal, savoring every luscious mouthful - then, five minutes before the end, a spokesman for the American Heart Association came on screen with a warning that high fat foods cause heart attacks.  Or, imagine a film showing scantily clad women in provocative poses until, five minutes before the end, a representative from N.O.W. came on screen and warned that we live in a sexist society and, simply by watching this trash, viewers are validating her point.  Such is the awe-inspiring hypocrisy of Fight Club, a film that purports to be a cautionary tale about violence but is in fact a tutorial in it.<br /><br />The basic premise, that urban man has lost touch with his inner Neanderthal, is an interesting one, and would have served as the basis of a good movie.  To see how a better director approached the idea of innate violence, revisit Clockwork Orange, a masterpiece that director Fincher (Se7en - a much better movie) has certainly studied.  Kubrick's chilling adaptation of the Burgess novel came complete with skinheads, one of many similarities between the two works.  The second act of Fight Club is an orgy of brute violence with absolutely no redeeming qualities, and the third act offers one of the shabbiest, cheapest, and stupidest \\"reveals\\" - or \\"aha\\" moments - in the history of recent film.  Ed Norton is a really fine actor, but his performance is wasted.  Brad Pitt, by contrast, doesn't get beaten up nearly enough to redeem this abomination.  Should have used the club on the director.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This movie showcases a pretty solid pool of talent. Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri and especially Kevin Spacey. Spacey truly rises above the crowd in this movie. His performance is convincing (which it has to be for the movie to \\"work\\") and stirring.<br /><br />This is an interesting story made up largely of mind games and betrayal. Each character has his own quirks and his own way of dealing with the situation they find themselves mixed up in. Baldwin and Del Toro's characters (who are partners in crime) are reckless, \\"balls-to-the-wall\\" criminals who like to go in with guns blazing. Gabriel Byrne's character is an ex-cop, so he is calculated and disciplined. Kevin Pollack's character is a Bad@ss who knows and executes his business well - while Kevin Spacey's character comes off as being intelligent, yet somewhat naive...<br /><br />It is fascinating to watch it all unfold with Verbal Kint's (Kevin Spacey) retelling of the tale in Kujan's office at the precinct. Detective Kujan is played by Chazz Palminteri. The scenes shared by Spacey and Palminteri in that office are among the best moments in the film. These two actors seem to push each other and it really plays well on-screen.<br /><br />Then, of course, the famous ending. Not to spoil it for those who have not yet seen the movie, but this is a twist ending that you probably won't see coming until very late in the movie. It's not your usual, corny cop-out twist ending. This is well written and well done. Highly recommended. There are some really good bonus features on the Special Edition DVD that are worth checking out.
0743487583|3.0|Mary Shelley had a great idea for Frankenstein... creation vs. creator is always an interesting topic, but Frankenstein is as dull as it gets! I had to read this book for school and I could barely get through it- the plot goes nowhere, and important parts of the book, such as the creation of the 'monster' happen very quickly. I had expected to read a true classic, but after reading it, I suggest watching one of the many movie versions despite their differences from the book.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|i think this band, as they mature, get better and better. i mean, twenty years ago they basically were just a group of california nincompoops churning out funk infused, hyperactive, juvenile s**t like 'true men dont kill coyotes.' <br /> <br />today, they're still a bunch of hyperactive nincompoops, but they offer tunes filled with love, soul, one big cali hippie new age love fest, if you will. who doesnt like anthony anyway? <br /> <br />and over the years, the soul just comes through more and more. between anthony and john f, both of whom look astonishgly fit and youthful given their rather debauched history, have not lost any energy in their forties. in fact, they are an inspiration to all us forty somethings. <br /> <br />i've listened to the first cd so far, and apart from one track (think its 5) that sounds a bit too much like it was borrowed from 'ummm bopp' by hanson, it's solidly good, even beautiful in places. when the peppers get it right, they are one of the best bands in the world. (they are sort of polar, cos when they get it wrong they catapult back to their early days of being s**t)... <br /> <br />dani california is a masterpiece, so is stadium arcadium, lyric wise anthony just knows how to say things, nothin rolls off anyone's tongue like his, and between that and john f's soulful trademark peppers guitar riffs (how do you give a bloody guitar that much soul), and the rich, succulent layers, the combination of heartfelt ballad, which he's always done well, and blood pumping chili power tunes having the same effect as downing two cans of red bull in two minutes, this is really thee record to buy this year. critics are spot on there. <br /> <br />i rate it just behind the strokes impressions of earth, though the chilis, they'll be around longer. <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a love story that cuts across lines of gender and sexuality, gripping the viewer with a dreadful sorrow that the deep and passionate devotion that these two lovers feel for each other is forbidden to them, on sentence of death. I cannot imagine how anyone but the most hard-hearted and bigoted of viewers could fail to see that the lovers portrayed in Brokeback Mountain are not different from us--whether we be gay or straight, male or female, rural or urban, we are all capable of loving the same way. Their tragedy is simply that society was and is incapable of accepting them. But most of all, above and beyond its controversial topic, Brokeback Mountain is one of the finest examples of filmmaking I've ever seen. I will make a point of seeing it again before it leaves the theaters.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Funeral is an album of great musical achievement. The music is fresh and creative. The band explores a variety of different textures and colors in the sound of their music. We hear heavy powerful rock juxtaposed against light atmospheric compositions and everything in between. The band uses instrumentation very effectively to paint all of these different colors. The listener has encounters with accordion, xylophone, harmonica, violin and a number of textures from keyboards. Arcade Fire presents a beautiful picture to it's listener, but when the vocals come in the picture gets smudged. Win Butler's tone quality leaves much to be desired. He sings abrasively and whiny. His voice lacks much depth or richness, communicating his message to his reader with a dry delivery. There are times when the vocals are so undesirable that the listener thinks the singer is slowly killing an innocent animal. This poor vocal technique often distorts the lyrics which while incredibly insightful and evocative are tough to handle when they can't be heard well. On the lighter songs on the album \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\" and \\"Neighborhood 4- 7 Kettles\\" the vocals are pretty tolerable for the entire song.<br /><br />Arcade Fire reminds me of Smashing Pumpkins in many ways. I feel that some incredibly well written music has been destroyed by the lead vocalist. I just don't like listening to Win Butler sing. The group would be great with a better vocalist. When the next album comes out, I am sure I won't buy it if the vocal quality is the same as this album.
B000002S4R|3.0|There's not much to add to the perceptive reviews listed below. Karajan's 1980s Flying Dutchman was a troubled project, like his Lohengrin. Both suffer from casting problems and both took years before he allowed their release. I suppose he wanted every major Wagner opera to be included in his recorded legacy, and so far as the condcuting goes, this is the best Flying Durchman recorded in the modern era (along with the Klemperer, also on EMI and afflicted with inadequate voices). The Overture is hair-raising, and the Berlin Phil. plays with extraordinary  power throughout.<br /><br />Mention should be made of the excellent chorus--both the women's Spinning Chorus and the men's more extensive sailors' choruses are highlights of this set. Karajan favored Jose Van Dam for almost two decades, but here his expert singing is defeated by an inability to sound tragic or even very personal. His baritonal timbre is too light for this quintessentially bass role. Senta, as sung by Vejzovic, is squawly and ill-tempered, more an Ortrud than a Senta. She sings without vibrato and is often just off pitch. Peter Hoffmann sounds weak and wobbbly as Erik. Even Kurt Moll makes for a sonorous but dull-witted Daland.<br /><br />Yet no one but the Senta is a disaster, and even if the listener comes away with a case of \\"what might have been,\\" Karajan's contribution is magnificent.

I'm not saying you're a bad person if you don't like it, I'm just saying take a look in the mirror & ask yourself if you want to be the kind of person who goes through life out of touch with greatness?
B0000013G9|5.0|It was probably considered to be the weirdest thing to some. Others may call it strange, and even odd. But for me growing up as young boy, and teenager my favorite group happens to be females!! As you well know they are TLC. Tionne \\"t-boz\\" Watkins, Lisa \\"left eye\\" Lopes, and Rozonda \\"chilli\\" Thomas.  <br /> <br />I was in 5th grade when their first album hit, and managed to memorize all the woman independence like lyrics, and mainly focused on the unique poetry of Lisa. Crazy Sexy Cool however was my favorite album they did. I must say their second is the best, and their ultimate anthem.  <br />You could have been and old man or woman but you knew TLC. Everywhere you went was \\"waterfalls\\" or \\"creep\\" (or news about Lisa being a little fired-fed up). \\"Diggin on you\\" is one of my favorite videos they did.  <br />Man those were the days back in middle school. My world was homework, my girl friend, and TLC (lol). <br /> <br />Any fan that does not have this in their collection must get it again!! Also anyone who collects CDs of past R & B music as a hobby must have this too!! Tragically my dreams of meeting them or seeing them live in concert may never come true. However even though she is gone now she did teach me that my dreams may seem like hopeless aspirations but I should believe in myself. RIP Peace Lisa, and may everyone be reminded of the words you wrote, and know for sure with out a doubt that it was truth that you spoke.  <br /> <br />There will never be another girl group like TLC, none now or later will ever be able to conquer singing, rapping, and dancing like they have. GO ATL even though I from Springfield, MA <br />

B00005JLWN|4.0|One night back in 2003, I was channel-surfing with one of my then-housemates on a Saturday night. As we went past The Movie Channel, I got a glimpse of Christian Bale in a cool black leather suit doing something totally funky with a huge semi-auto pistol. The movie was halfway through, but we decided to take a look at what it was all about. We ended up watching the rest of the movie, and wondering why it is that we never heard anything about it when it came out in the theaters, because it was pretty durn good. I had to go online and look up the movie schedule to get the name, and then I went and rented the DVD to get the whole movie. <br /> <br />This movie is a new cult classic. I won't go over the plot synopses here, but I will say that while its inspirations are readily apparent, this movie is not a rip-off of anything. It is totally orginal, down to the gun-kata discipline which is just good ol'-fashioned butt-kicking made glamourous. I don't know if gun-kata is actually possible, but all acttion scense that included it were great. THe storyline is pretty simple and straight forward. <br /> <br />The acting is very good. Christian Bale does a solid job of making John Preston real and sympathetic, Taye Diggs is deliciously smarmy as Preston's new partner (who has a lot of pride in himself; isn't that a crime, Bill Fichter pops up a bit and Angus McFayden deserves a mention.  <br /> <br />Odds are that you've never heard this movie. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not going to on the Library of Congress historical archive, but it will go on the \\"fun movie to watch over weekend with the peeps.\\" Go check it out and let your imagination soar.
0375757856|4.0|In many ways this is a brilliant work.  It's difficult to review now since our tastes have changed and since part of its value was in its originality -- which has been built upon by more modern authors.  Thus, it is a true classic.  One's valuation of it has much to do with whether one evaluates it in the context of the 19th century or the 21st.  Collins subtly criticizes much of 19th century English society in his treatment of Ezra, Clack, Mrs. Merridew, etc.  Even Betteredge's reliance on \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" seems to reflect on Victorian religious mores (i.e. perhaps (?)  an allusion to the Bible).  Differences in social mores today can be seen in both Rachel's & Rosanna's coverups etc.  The basic structure of the book--a series of eyewitness accounts reminds one of certain TV shows & the normal operation of our police or CSIs--where evidence is uncovered bit by bit though interviews & re-interviews.  Today's mysteries rely on yesterday's just as today's sitcoms rely on Shakespeare's comedies.  Collins appears to succeed overall in well-defining his characters and their styles along with their assumptions, prejudices, etc.  However, as Collins states in his Author's Preface, \\"The attempt made here, is to trace the influence of character on circumstances\\" vs. its opposite per most other novels.  This is a lengthy & enjoyable (though at times a bit tedious & wordy) novel--not really escape fiction as with many of the pseudo mysteries of today (more suspense story than legitimate mystery with clues etc. that are fair to the reader).  Its values are much deeper.  It may not become your favorite, but it's well worth discovering.

B000EMGAOY|2.0|I am a huge Chili Pepper fan, have been for over ten years... each and every album since b.s.s.m. has excited and inspired me and ive looked forward to all of them and knew that the next would be just as great and i'd love that as well. unfortunately, it seems that this has ended. i could have listened to the album weeks in advance and not even purchased it.. but as with all my favorite bands i support and purchase their albums.. i preordered it months before .. the limited edition version which is quite expensive.. once the album arrived i listened .. all the way through.. despite being bored and unentertained by most on the first cd i continued onward and never stopped until i had heard all the tracks. ultimately, i am very dissapointed. there are a few decent tracks on here.. in fact there are quite a few \\"decent\\" tracks id say but not for the chili peppers.. that said, i dont think of them any differently and i dont think they have \\"gone soft\\" or anything.. i think thats a foul thing to say.. they make music that they love.. no matter how it sounds.. they put it out.. thats a great band.. they follow their hearts with all their music.. and music has to change.. music has to evolve.. bands have to evolve.. otherwise .. well otherwise to put it plain and simple they just suck.. and im not into bands that suck.. anyway.. despite not being into these songs i will always be a huge fan of the peppers and continue to stay true and devoted to them as i do with all my favorite bands. i know their love is shared for all of the fans as well.. they're good people. (And By The Way.. hehe.. if anyone has not read Anthony's book i strongly encourage you to do so. It's an amazing book.. it is one of my favorites :) <br /> <br />good bands change.. you have to expect that theyre going to change.. there are always going to be people that like that change and people that don't.. that doesnt mean you should turn on them.. but as for this album and many other fans that found it as an overall dissapointment i dont think i will be listening to this much.. and even though itd be difficult to think of selling one of the chili's cds.. i think i might with this one.. <br /> <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This is Pearl Jam's crowning achievement with a whole pot of top notch rockers and ballads steaming with an uninhibited spontaneous creative spark that is truly inspiring. <br />Pearl Jam are back with a ferocious vengeance and they haven't rocked this hard since the glory days of their masterpieces VS. and Vitalogy which this album basically sounds like a combination of those two though the lyrical content is bent toward a more political vein. <br />This album will rip your head off with its savage onslaught of inspired rock n' roll rampage and will stir your thoughts with its deeply profound lyrical content. <br />I am so glad that i gave Pearl Jam a chance because i had lost hope after the classic album Vitalogy. <br />I felt that the focus wasn't completely intact and the experimental phases just didn't do it for me. <br />This is a lean and mean Pearl jam back with a vengeance so click on that select button and get ready to believe in rock n' roll again. <br />Pearl Jam is keeping the flame alive! <br />I must warn you that this album rocked so hard that my nuts exploded when \\"World wide suicide\\" cranked its raging furious rock out of my system but that's the price you have to pay for REAL rock n' roll. <br />OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />Seriously though...this is an instant hard rock classic and its guaranteed to rock your friggin head off so grab this bad boy quick!!!! <br /> <br />O.F.

B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is my favorite of all the Pink Floyd Albums.  It is the best rock album of all time.  The music of this album has the potential to transport any listener to another place.  Each of the tracks offers something new and all are equally poetic.  Dark Side of the Moon is an album that people from all walks of life can enjoy.  The album includes mellow spacy /progressive rock tracks. The tracks are neither fast nor complex.  The catchy tunes are addictive enough to please many.  Dark Side of the Moon includes the use of many different sounds, like old man voices in the background, existential laughs, mechanical clocks, ringing clocks, heartbeats, and cash machine operations.   <br /> <br />The track \\"Time\\" includes some excellent catchy female backing vocals.  The song begins with the sounds of clocks and bells ringing.  It continues then into a ticking clock that could even be interpreted as a tricking bomb or a fast heartbeat. The song then gets going with David Gilmour's aggressive vocals, singing some of Roger Waters' best lyrics.  Richard Wright then comes in to do some singing of his own, before Gilmour delivers a staggering guitar solo.  The track \\"Money\\" begins with rhythmic sounds of cash registers drawers and bells sliding and ringing.  This song is a great blues/rock n'roll selection including a sax and guitar.  It shows the rockier side of Pink Floyd.   <br /> <br />After researching the lyrics and how this album came about I found that the group wanted to make an album that would deal with issues that drove people mad.  Each song has a different meaning but all are interpretations of problems in society.  \\"Breathe\\" is a lovely, smooth song with wonderful harmonies that sets up the theme of the toils of life.  \\"Time\\" is obviously a song about how time seems to rule us all.  No sooner do you become accustomed to the quiet then tick-tocks of clocks begin to fade in.  \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" is a quiet and interesting song that begins with a piano intro and a woman, Clare Torry, vocalizes throughout the rest of the track, building up to what has been described as an \\"orgasmic\\" peak., and then slowly tapering off to a low moan.  This song is meant to symbolize death.  The topic of \\"Money\\" is obvious when you hear the cling-clang of coins and cash registers.  This track bluntly speaks of the power of money.  <br /> <br />I am drawn to Pink Floyd because they are so different from so many other bands. They were extremely inventive when writing this album.  The lyrics are actually about subjects that all people can relate to, which are problems. Everyone should give this album a chance even if this is not their favorite genre.  From the moment you begin the CD and the soft thump of a heartbeat begins to fade up, you will know that you have chosen no ordinary 70's rock album.  <br /> <br />When listening to some of the earlier Pink Floyd you can hear many similarities to their sound to that of the Beatles.  The Beatles were amazing and inventive as well.  While I do enjoy the Beatles my preference is Floyd.  My second favorite album by Pick Floyd is Wish you Were Here.  This album followed Dark side of the Moon brilliantly.  Pink Floyd was not interested in \\"topping\\" Dark Side of the Moon, they were simply expressing new thoughts and feelings.  <br />
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Gnarls Barkley, exsists...the issue is whether or not we are inclined to see him...I have in fact met Gnarls more than once...While studying in my final year at Oxford University, I call calmly recall a encounter with an individual that left my life in a whimsical whirlwind ever since.    Trying to reflect on what I was aspiring to be in my lifetime, a middle aged gentlemen approcached the table where my life at the time was scattered and proposed a simple question to my psyche...\\"What is freedom?\\"    Taking out the earphones of my recently purchased IPOD nano, I gazed a him with a dazed and confused look on my face..\\"who are you?\\" I responded.  \\"So, sorry, allow me to introduce myself, I am Gnarls, Gnarls Barkley.\\"    Not knowing that he truly did exsist, I was astonished that the man who crafted Beautiful music such as St. Elsewhere, in it's singular and entirity was actually taking time to quiz me.    We chatted and I asked him about the album. I needed to know how \\"Crazy\\" understood how I felt in the shower each morning I woke up...I mean, was he there, knowing my thoughts?    Questioned about \\"Smiley faces\\" and why he now noticed the smile that I was carrying.     I just had to know his thoughts on \\"Just a Thought\\" and Gnarls satisfied my inquistive nature 5 times over.    St. Elsehere is so beautiful, so organic, so unlike anything there ever was. It was like a reflection of my thought pattern played out to a beat. It shows me that I'm not alone...Someone understands, and that is Gnarls Barkley.    When Gnarls left my table, he dapped me off with a pound and said, remember what I asked you at first...I slowly nodded and returned the earphones in my ear.     Looking up to watch him walk away, he was gone, and a vivacious woman stood where he should have been. She looked back at me and signaled to look down at the title on my IPOD...Playing in my ears, the line, \\"I CAN TRANSFORM without even trying.\\"    And I knew...Gnarls is special...This album performs betterthan a middle aged man on Viagra with a 21 year old...A MUST HAVE, thank you Gnarls...and if you see this, Lemme know when we're going to Vegas again!!!
B00007AJF9|2.0|I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!<br /><br />If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it!
B000EPR7NE|3.0|No surprises here, Hans Zimmer's Da Vinci Code soundtrack is heavy on cathedral choruses and strings, with tracks starting softly, then building, building, building to the moment of truth.<br />Ultimately, the score is very quiet, as it frequently relies on a single instrument or voice for several beats, making for better relaxation music than the sound of a multi-million dollar thriller based on a bestseller that stirred controversy with the Catholic Church.<br />This doesn't mean the music is bad, it just doesn't rank with Zimmer masterpieces such as Gladiator and The Lion King, but it certainly had the potential considering the subject matter.<br />Zimmer, one of the best composers out there, has set the bar high for himself, and the Da Vinci Code score on its own doesn't stand out.
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in some time.  Christian Bale is superb as are the other actors.  I remember watching the tv series growing up and had heard this version was the best of the movies.  It will renew your faith that great movies are still being made.
B000002J29|5.0|Phil Collins.  What can I say.  He blew everyone away with the fact he pulled this off.  Maybe it led to him getting cocky and wanting to break out into his own as a Pop Star.  Doesn't matter.  We'll always have this one true 'Genesis Moment'.  They didn't do a better record (live or studio).  This is my 'Greatest Hits' CD.  Lots of imagination went into writing and performing these classic tracks.  I didn't get to see them live back in the day (I was a bit too young), but this live 'virtual concert' is great to listen to.
B0000CFW87|5.0|One thing is for certain. I hear some people actually sleep when they heard this album. That is absolute rubbish to me. It menas they certainly do not know how to appreciate music of this kind. I listen to this album when I am studying to give me the peace to study. <br />Josh Gorban is one of the most talented young artists I have ever heard of. Even though he hasn't finished his studies. He already has 2 albums reknowned world-wide.  <br />In fact, I admire his talent. But on this album he goes from an uprising vocal performance on the opening number \\"Oceano\\" to the sorrowful \\"My Confession\\" which sounded very emotional. Making use of his deeply mellow voice. As he is a tenor.  <br />His voice is just surprisingly beautiful as everyone who knows his music. Stretching through the rest of his album which is indeed an achievement for one his age. Which really means that bage never matters but only that the gift is present. Then comes the ballad of \\"Remember When It Rained\\" and to the impressive \\"You Raise Me Up\\" ballad that got us all hooked in the first place. But I feel he hasn't exhausted his limits yet and there is still so much more depth to his music. But never the less this album is indeed very good and an excellent step forward from his last album. Well Done Groban! <br />
B0000AQVCL|4.0|If you like this retro rock stuff, you're gonna get what you need!  This is the coolest CD, it's already a classic.  If this is what the kids wanna hear and what the 20 to 50 something's wanna hear, what does that say?  There is a HUGE market for retro sounding rock (Roots Rock).  There is no doubt if I were to start a band today, I'd be playing this kinda stuff.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|As a long time fan of Madonna, I was happy to hear her latest album which is a return to her dance groove roots and an homage to Disco!  She has definitely gotten into the groove once more having been a bit off kilter with her AMERICAN LIFE album (but I love her anyway!).  If you haven't been to her concert YOU MUST GO.  The whole thing is a party and everyone is invited.  VIP all around.  Her visuals are spectacular and compliment and bring to life each song.  For those of us that LOVE vintage Madonna she DOES sing LIKE A VIRGIN!  However, HOLIDAY is not in the mix.  Nor is INTO THE GROOVE.  But go SEE the music from CONFESSIONS.  It's a feast for the eyes and ears!  If you can't go see Madonna perform, BUY THE ALBUM and visualize (at least until the HBO special comes out!).
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I have always been a little suspicious of short stories that are turned into movies. I always wonder: How are they going to fill the other hour-and-a-half? Strangely, this problem does not occur in Brokeback Mountain. I'd read the short story first and - watching the movie - I did not feel that they were padding for time. In fact, it seems like the story can barely be contained to the time restrictions of the movie.  <br /> <br />Perhaps this is because this movie is about emotions and images - not words. Its characters are not from a very verbal society. In fact, it is a running joke in the film how little Ennis (Heath Ledger) speaks. The little dialogue from the short story lasts the whole movie.  <br /> <br />This is a Western - Ang Lee beautifully captures the Wyoming countryside. When the action moves into town, the sight of man's raunchy trailers and houses set against the backdrop of the majestic mountains makes a convincing argument for nature over civilization.  <br /> <br />It is civilization that is ultimately the downfall of these two characters. They meet and fall in love - all the while convinced that they are not homosexuals. The story begins in 1963 and - if it had occurred a little later - tragedy may have been averted. Yet, despite the tragic overtones of the story, there is still something joyful about it. Despite all odds, these two men find each other and - a few times a year at least - find true happiness. Perhaps that makes everything else worth while.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|When the Gilmore Girls first came out, I was excited to see a show with strong, independent & funny female leads.<br /><br />This show has strong writing, quick wit and humor.  The actors and actresses pull it off flawlessly.  Each season builds on the work of previous seasons and introduces new characters.<br /><br />One of the beautiful things about Gilmore Girls is the character devlopment.  It starts of with Lorelai and Rory Gilmore but builds beyond them into developing pretty much the whole town of Stars Hollow.  Many of the quirky characters bring humor and a touch of seriousness to the show.<br /><br />If your looking for a new series to get into, give this one a try as it's a keeper in my collection.  My wife and I have recently just finished going through seasons 1 through 5 again and are eager for season 6 to be released.<br /><br />This box set has the added bonus of giving you the actual show pilot. I had never seen this episode before and it was rather enjoyable to see where it all began.<br /><br />Sit down and get ready for a brilliant ride as this show will provide you with laughter, humor, serious issues, happy moments and sad moments along the way! Gilmore Girls is Must See TV.
B00005LMBK|3.0|Popular music in the 1990s saw the rise of Grunge music.  Grunge music would soon make its way into the mainstream becoming one of the dominant forms of popular music.   By the time the 2000s came about, Grunge was moving toward the background and an offshoot of Grunge called \\"Post Grunge\\" began to take its place.   The elements of Post Grunge music contain simple chord progressions and gentle verses followed by louder choruses.   For whatever reason, Post Grunge sounds now seems to be the dominant form of music.   Many longtime popular music fans have accused this type of music of being very \\"cookie cutter\\" and all sounding the same.   I feel there is validity in that statement.   As a result, the popular music scene has become in desperate need of some new type of sound to take hold of.    Back when Nirvana came around and led the revolution in the music scene through Grunge - it was something radical and different (helping to end the Synth Pop era).  Now with the remnants of Grunge through Post Grunge, the music business seems in need of some radical and different sound.   This is what has attracted me to the band \\"Gorillaz\\".    While I wouldn't call it my favorite type of sound, there is no doubt that Gorillaz can be looked upon as something that is groundbreaking in the music industry.   While Gorillaz may seem groundbreaking because they are an animated band, it is their sound that also must be considered groundbreaking.    This sound can be heard on their self titled debut album - \\"Gorillaz\\".    <br /> <br />I must admit, I have not bought into the whole concept of a virtual, animated band.   I do question if several years after this review is written whether they will continue to ride a wave of success.  However, one can't argue - at the time of this review they have made it work - both on their debut album and especially on their hugely successful follow-up \\"Demon Days\\".   The style of both of these albums incorporate a variety of many styles - Funk, Hip-Hop, Big Band, Orchestral, Rock, and Pop.     Gorillaz debut album would be the album that would lay the foundation for this style of music.   \\"Demon Days\\" would pick up this sound and build a conceptual theme around it.   While the self-titled \\"Gorillaz\\" doesn't have the strong conceptual theme that \\"Demon Days\\" has - it does demonstrate the groundbreaking sound offered by the band.   In a lot of ways, I think the fact that Gorillaz is an animated band overshadows the sound that Gorillaz constructed on this album. <br /> <br />I'm not going to say that this sound is the greatest thing since sliced bread - because its not.   There are times where I thought the end product was not very entertaining from a musical perspective.  However, I still give credit for the band for doing something different and avoiding the cookie cutter sound of recent years. <br /> <br />One great example of this groundbreaking sound is found on the primarily instrumental track, \\"Double Bass\\".   As indicated by the titled - you basically hear a double bass.  You can literally hear the plucking of the bass strings on parts of the song.  The guitar laden sounds of post grunge aren't here - instead you get some very clever use of keyboards.  \\"Rock the House\\" is another track that shows Gorillaz thinking out of the box.  The song might have a Hip Hop feel, but Gorillaz surrounds the song with a \\"Game Show\\" instrumental like sound.    While I'm not the biggest Hip Hop fan, the game show sound works.  Another song that shows Gorillaz thinking beyond the box is \\"Latin Simone\\".   As indicated by the title, Gorillaz incorporates a Latin sound.  With some classic Latin sounding vocals and melodies, Gorillaz manages to put a haunting spin on the song - and this really works well.   On \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\", Gorillaz combines elements of Rhythm and Blues with a strong emphasis on \\"Blues\\" on parts of this track.   This song might be the strongest track on the collection.  \\"5/4\\" might include the simple guitar riffs found in post Grunge, but the Hip Hop vocals and terrific background vocals will quickly erase any similarities to a cookie-cutter sound. <br /> <br />There are two tracks that appear twice - as originals and \\"remixes\\" - each with different results.   The \\"original\\" \\"Clint Eastwood\\" (Track 5) has a slow tempo with more of a classical Hip Hop feel to it.  This contrasts to the faster-paced remix found on the last track.  Some how I found the remix to be the better track.   Just like \\"Clint Eastwood\\", I found the remix of \\"19-2000\\" on Track 18 to be far superior to the original version of this track that is found on Track 11.  The original version has a slower tempo with a Hip Hop flavor while the remix has a faster, more mainstream feel.  The beat to the remix even sounds like an up-tempo  \\"Iko Iko\\". <br /> <br />At the same time, there are some weaker tracks.   While these tracks don't exhibit the cookie-cutter feel to Post Grunge songs, they still don't make me do handstands.   Songs such as \\"New Genius (Brother Mix)\\", \\"Man Research (Clapper)\\", \\"Starshine\\", \\"Slow Country\\", \\"M1 A1\\", and \\"Left Hand Suzuki Method\\" can't be faulted for originality - but they didn't really inspire me.  For example, \\"Left Hand Suzuki Method\\" makes use of some orchestral qualities - but I just didn't find it to be a standout track. <br /> <br />One should be warned.  While the animated band may be attractive to children, the music on this album does contain explicit language.  Parents should also be warned that even the animated short is not something that is what I would term \\"Kid Friendly\\".   I wish the liner notes did contain the lyrics.  Overall, the groundbreaking sound gives this album a boost.  It also sets a foundation for Gorillaz to even do better on their subsequent works.   I'd still recommend it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember when Firefly first came out and was so highly publicized by FOX.  The funny thing was that I was desperate for a good sci-fi and FOX's brilliant decision to air the 2nd episode instead of the Pilot cost them at least one viewer.  Not that the 2nd episode was bad, but just a little hard to follow without any background.  After all the opening scene has 3 cowboy looking crew mates getting into a brawl in a tavern only to be saved by their spaceship at cliffs edge.  Immediately I turned it off and thought nothing of it.  I remember thinking: \\"Cowboys in space\\"<br /><br />Years later a friend invited me to see the movie Serenity and I loved it.  It was later that another friend informed me that it had been the original Firefly series.  With a lot more knowledge of the characters from the movie, I watched an episode on Sci-Fi and immediately fell in love with it.<br /><br />For xmas, my wife and I purchased the DVD set and watch the whole series in one day.  From start to finish the entire series is exceptional!  Way better than most of the shows that manage to survive on the television and I can only shudder to think that it's because of a bonehead executive deciding they didn't want to give this highly touted (by them) show 2 hours to introduce itself.  I loved the pilot!<br /><br />While it's true that there is a certain wild west feel to the show, Firefox has so many elements that make it good.  There is tension, compassion and lots of humor, some of which can be campy.  It's a definite sci-fi show but on the edge of the frontier, something I wish Star Trek might have explored.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this show to you, especially if you are into sci-fi or even westerns! Great series that I'll re-watch over and over. If only we could convince Sci-fi to make some new episodes...
0440238609|4.0|In His Dark Materials, Philip Pullman writes an exciting, engaging, and enjoyable adventure story that should be on the bookshelves of both young adult and older readers.<br /><br />Why? In part, because its heroes (Lyra, Will, Iorek, Lee Scoresby, Mary Malone, Serafina Pekkala, et al.) display many of the finest qualities found in humans: love, compassion, loyalty, bravery, reason, etc.<br /><br />Pullman is also adept at portraying the ambiguities of making choices. It may make sense to present the world in stark \\"black and white\\" to 4- and 5-year olds but when a child reaches the \\"tweens,\\" it's time to make them realize that very few decisions are entirely good or entirely evil. An example is Will's use of the \\"subtle knife.\\" With it he can open windows into many worlds - helping him and Lyra to escape or making it possible to go to the Land of the Dead and free the spirits there. But every time he uses it, he creates a Spectre an another fissure is opened through which Dust escapes.<br /><br />As to Pullman's obvious dislike of organized religion: I think he's right on the mark. It's probably a hallmark of any large institution or bureaucracy that it stifles dissent, compassion, and individuality; sacrificing the human in favor of something supposedly greater (whether God, the state, or some other abstraction). From a spiritual point of view, the worst thing that happened to Christianity was Constantine.<br /><br />As to Pullman's take on God: Again, I'm in complete sympathy with his point of view. Assuming that there is a transcendent creator, it's certainly not the God of Abraham and his children. Actually, Pullman follows a long tradition that goes back (at least) 2,000 years to the Gnostics. Some sects believed the God of the Hebrew Bible was a psychopath who maliciously condemned/trapped innocent souls in filthy material bodies. Others took a more charitable view, characterizing the demi-urge as merely hapless. More recent explorations of a similar theme would include James Blish's Black Easter/Day After Judgment duology, Michael Moorcock's The War Hound and the World's Pain, Steven Brust's To Reign in Hell, and, most recently, Jacqueline Carey's The Sundering.<br /><br />In sum, keep an open mind, let His Dark Materials join Tolkien, Lewis, Le Guin, and others on your fantasy shelf even if you can't accept his philosophy.theme would include James Blish's Black Easter/Day After Judgment duology, Michael Moorcock's The War Hound and the World's Pain, Steven Brust's To Reign in Hell, and, most recently, Jacqueline Carey's The Sundering. <br /> <br />In sum, keep an open mind, let His Dark Materials join Tolkien, Lewis, Le Guin, and others on your fantasy shelf even if you can't accept his philosophy.

0812976525|3.0|This novel is a satire telling about the career choice of one Nick Naylor. He \\"pays the mortgage\\" by being the chief spokesman for the main tabacco lobby.  He justifies the killing of 465,000 people a year by claiming that smoking really is not bad for you and that much of the scientific data cannot be backed up.  He becomes a character the reader loves to hate.  The story is mainly one of satire towards the political correctness of Washington's finest, but he develops some sort of plot when Nick is kidnapped and covered in nicotine patches. Ironically, the event left him unable to smoke. <br />  I found myself laughing to the good humor of the book, especially in the meetings of the MOD Squad, consisting of Nick and the cheif spokesmen for the alcohol and gun lobbies. Their conversations are highly unorthodox and keep the reader aware of the lobbies in our government. Ultimately, the novel is about making your own choices and taking responsibility for the consequences.   <br />  As I stated above, I did see the movie and enjoyed it more than the book. The manipulation and political corruption was much more prevalent and engaging in the movie. However, the book has a much different ending, which I will not spoil.  It has made me hate tabacco, their lobbies, and the corruption of the US government even more, feeling I think Christopher Buckley wanted to portray. He is a good satirical author and is very creative in his methods.
0399241523|5.0|Before you read the review of ARK ANGEL, you need to take into account that this is the sixth book in the engaging, entertaining, action-packed adventure series starring Alex Rider.  If you haven't read the first five books in the series, you'll probably want to do that before you pick up ARK ANGEL.  Although it can stand on its own, you'll feel more in the loop by reading the previous books first.<br /><br />ARK ANGEL picks up immediately where [[ASIN:0142405787 Scorpia (Alex Rider Adventure)]], book five, left off.  At the end of that book, we saw Alex Rider on the ground, wounded by a sniper's bullet.  For those who thought that Anthony Horowitz was planning to kill off our favorite young MI6 agent, please be assured that ARK ANGEL does not in any way imply dead.  Alex is alive and relatively well, recuperating in an exclusive private hospital in London.  The sniper's bullet missed his heart, instead bouncing off a rib and exiting out his arm.  Now, as he's recovering in posh room nine of the hospital, he becomes friends with Paul.  The same Paul that turns out to be the son of Nikolai Drevin, one of the richest men in the world.<br /><br />When Alex saves Paul during a kidnapping attempt, Nikolai invites Alex to finish his recuperation at his estate.  Alex soon wonders at the wisdom of being in Drevin's company, however, when he learns that an eco-terrorist group known as Force Three has threatened not only the Drevin family, but the safety of the entire world.<br /><br />Nikolai Drevin's latest project, Ark Angel, is in full swing.  Designed to become the first ultimate luxury hotel in outer space, it contains everything the world's richest people could want.  It's also, at least according to Force Three, a threat to the environment of Earth as we know it.  Now the members of the terrorist group are out to stop Ark Angel from ever opening, and they'll do anything--and everything--they can to see their mission come to completion.  Even if it means hurtling the hotel back through the atmosphere and onto Earth's surface.<br /><br />ARK ANGEL is another action-adventure read that will keep you turning pages right through to the end.  Alex Rider has come a long way since the fourteen-year old boy roped into complying with MI6, but there's part of him that's still determined to leave the spy organization for good.  Yet he knows that his skills are needed, and the unending action of ARK ANGEL show in detail why that is.

B000000OAL|5.0|As Queen progressed through it's life, the band evolved into various stages and styles. Here we have Queen at it's humble beginning with strait up Rock 'N' Roll Metal With A Little Glitter. <br />      <br />     The guitar intro to Keep Yourself Alive is strait up 70's riff rock. Incredible guitar and lyrics. The song is about exactly what it's called, surviving in the world (although I'm sure Brian May was doing alright). Doing All Right is a song that is bound to grow on you over time. At first you'll think it's got a strange style, but over time it will become a Queen classic for anyone. Great King Rat, one of my top picks from this album. It's amazing what Brian May can do with a guitar. The singing of Freddie Mercury top shape as always, with intrigueing lyrics. My Fairy King, if Bohemian Rhapsody never came to be, this Rock Opera would take its place. With singing going from the lowest of the lowest to incredible high notes in a second, Freddie greatly claims is title as best rock vocalist of all time. Liar, this song won't have to grow on you, because you'll like it from the first time you hear that drum and cowbell intro and clap right along. Brian jumps in and attacks you with the guitar riff and picks it up for this 6 minute epic. The Night Comes Down, not much to say, but it's a fine song. Modern Times Rock 'N' Roll is the most Led Zeppelin like thing Queen ever did. Son and Daughter, the B side to KYA, great rock song. Very headbang worthy. Jesus, a slower song. Seven Seas of Rhye, interesting but nothing compared to the fuller version later on. Mad The Swine, not my favorite, but all right. <br />      <br />     All that really needs to be said is that Queen's debut album is an amazing rock record and essential for any Queen fan wishing to dig deeper than a cheap greatest hits album.  <br />
B000063DIR|3.0|Once again, like \\"blizzard , a classic metal album has been tampered with. This just goes to show how greedy ozzy has become. Lets face it, the reality show has ruined everything
B000000W5L|5.0|I'm 28.  I first listened to the Stones when I was probably 8 or 9.  My famiy used to drive across the country every summer to go places like Florida and Texas.  I had an old walkman and a few Stones tapes that I snagged from my older brother.  I remember being a kid and listening to this record in the car while we drove across the Southern US, and it just fit everything perfectly.  I would flip the tape over and over for hours and hours and that's when I fell in love with the Rolling Stones.  Now, 20 or so years later (wow time flies), when people ask me for my top 3 albums of all time, this album is always in there.  I still listen to it all the time.  It is timeless, and, as has been said many times before, this is probably the Stones greatest album.  Nothing against what they did in the 60's but in my opinion, their early 70's stuff is the best.  There is just something about it that can't really be expressed.  Of course, when I hear this record it really takes me back and stirs up memories of when I first really discovered music.  Personally, my favorite tracks on here are songs like Torn and Frayed, Shine a Light, Happy, Sweet Virginia...heck, everything.  Do yourself a favor and pick this album up if you're a rock fan.  You need it in your collection.
B000068R1X|4.0|The 4-star rating is for the original album, before ozzy became all greedy and such. It brings a tear to my eye to see this happen to some very good metal albums. Unlike \\"diary\\" and \\"blizzard\\", this album has been completely remixed, and unless you are a new ozzy fan, this album is a waste of time. <br />FIND THE '95 ORIGINAL!!!!
0375507256|4.0|I just finished reading 'Cloud Atlas' by David Mitchell.  It is a long read, and at times it is a slow read.  As I'm sure you know, the novel is about six stories which are loosely connected.  Some of the stories read quickly and some read much slower. <br /> <br />'Cloud Atlas' could easily have been written by six different authors.  Mitchell definitely is a master at writing in different literary styles.  Sometimes he takes a little too much license in using vocablulary which can be hard to understand.  But after awhile you'll pick up on his clever, unique use of language. <br /> <br />Overall, I liked all of the six stories.  All of the stories were captivating and intriguing.  Mitchell made me want to keep reading to see what happened in each story.  'Cloud Atlas' is a really cool unique book - even if it's a little challenging.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|There is not one single wasted word, image, or sound in this bracingly beautiful love story. Like all of the best, it rips at your heart with a wrenching, soulful ache that will not end with the credits. Heath Ledger is simply perfect, as are virtually all of the actors in this film; Ang Lee again nails a place and a time (Sense & Sensibility) with razor-sharp attention to the detail. I so hope that people everywhere will see this movie - it is much bigger than a \\"gay romance\\" - it is about holding things in; about all of the things that keep us from what we want and who we love; it is about all of us. And don't fight the choke in your throat, just cry. It's one of those rare things in life that is truly - cathartic.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|There's too much filler on this album. When I first heard \\"Best of You,\\" I was highly dissapointed. Having loved the Foo Fighters ever since The Colour and the Shape, I was hoping for something a little more redeming after One by One. My hopes were let down...way down. Had they released one album with selections from the rock side and the mellow side, this would have been a solid piece of music. Furthermore, the copy protected disc doesn't help. It sounds like crap on my iRiver.
0156030209|4.0|Piscine Molitor Patel, the main character in the The Life of Pi, is a 16 year old boy from India, who tells of his adventures on a life boat, struggling to survive in the middle of the ocean with a bengal tiger aboard. The first chapter of the book describes his current life, emotions and reflections after his ocean voyage. Subsequent chapters of Part One give us a complete background of his life. Pi lived at the Pondicherry Zoo, which is owned by his father. His daily life with the zoo animals would help him survive aboard the lifeboat with the tiger. Pi was a serious student of religion and followed different beliefs and practices. All of these deep religious beliefs also helped him to survive the desperate situations he faced everyday at sea. Pi and his family had to move to Canada, after the Pondicherry Zoo closed.It was during the trip to Canada that the ship carrying his family and zoo animals, sank and Pi and the Bengal tiger ended up on the lifeboat.  <br />     Section Two describes his life at sea. Sometimes gross, sometimes sad, sometimes peaceful. His vivid descriptions of survival brought many different emotions as the reader follows his daily life. You begin to wonder how he will survive, yet you already have read that he does. Sometimes you wonder if he is dreaming or if the situations actually occurred.  <br />    This book is definitely worth reading. It starts out slow, with you wondering if you are ever going to get to the part of the lifeboat and the tiger. But in the end, you understand that the background section helps you reflect on his feelings and understand how he survives. It is amazing how the author makes an unbelievable sitation, believable.
0671798154|5.0|I like reading WWII fiction and this book is about as good as it gets. This is not an overly complicated or complex book written on multiple levels, and telling many stories; the writing style is very direct and the plot is reasonably straight-forward.....but none of that matters with this book. The story was GREAT, the tension perfect, the scenes were so cleverly put together, the characters sympathetic, the action intense...everything was perfect about this book, especially if you are looking for an intelligent action adventure in a World War II setting.<br /><br />In fact, I know what I really liked about this book. The protagonist, Jack Cray, was smart!! Too many adventure books feature chiseled heroes with their caricature, beautiful, romantic love interests being chased by armies of evil bad guys and narrowly escaping forty-seven times with their lives, sheerly through blind luck and the incompetence of their foes. I hate that. James Thayer doesn't insult you with that pap. His hero is tasked with escaping an escape-proof POW camp, crossing war-torn Germany, evading a huge man-hunt that is focused on nailing him, and making his way into Hitler's bunker to assassinate him under the eyes of his guards. A ridiculously impossible task. Yet the guy does it and the amazing thing is my intelligence was never once insulted! He never \\"lucked out\\", he simply out-thought, out-maneouvered, and just plain beat the enemy. It's an amazing story and just too much fun. At the beginning of every sequence you simply cannot figure out how the guy can possibly accomplish what he has to do....yet at the end he has done it and you are stunned because it could have been done that way! I hate books when the characters are dumber than rocks and luckier than lottery winners...this is that rarest of books where the characters are smarter than you. A. C. Doyle did it with Sherlock Holmes, but you don't expect that kind of intelligence in a WWII action adventure starring a lone American commando. This guy could eat Rambo for breakfast yet he is never unbelievable. Incredibly tough yes, incredibly smart yes, ruthless when necessary, but never unbelievable. This is just a brilliant book and my hat is off to James Thayer for one of the most enjoyable and intelligent reads I've experienced this year.<br /><br />Colin LindseyThis guy could eat Rambo for breakfast yet he is never unbelievable.

Actually you can pretty much hear someone as good in ANY blues club in San Francisco, New York, L.A., Austin. The Emperor has no clothes.

In fact, she's DEAD. But even with these two behind him, MAYBE a very boring Robin Trower, MAYBE? I read some of the other reveiws and I really have to wonder? Please. Educate me.I INVITE you; WHAT HAS THIS KID GOT THAT COMPARES TO LESLIE WEST, JOHNNY WINTER, ROBIN TROWER, MICK RONSON.....THE LIST GOES ON!!! <br />As for Pino Paladino and Steve Jordon, no offense meant. I bought the CD to listen to you guys anyway. Again, I've heard you both play a lot more \\"Inspired\\". But, hey, nice job considering. <br />For what it's worth, Pino, I play bass. If something good comes up and you need out, I'll cover the rest of the dates with this kid. Steve, I can find a drummer so same goes for you.

B00005K9LK|4.0|This is not an overwhelmingly sophisticated metal album, just a series of straight ahead rockers, some fast some mid-paced with a bit of ballading thrown in at the end for good measure.  It's got a certain cheese factor to it, as does virtually all classic/power metal, but it's held in check and just adds to the fun.  This is plenty commerical, but it's not condescending and overdone like so much 80's metal, and still has a certain edge to it.  Tipton and Downing aren't quite at the top of their game, but they can still tear it up, and Halford sounds great, as usual, even if he doesn't display the sorta range he did on some of their earlier albums.<br /><br />There aren't any bad songs on this album, though I'm not terrribly in love with 'Pain & Pleasure'.  Not a bad song, really, but not terribly inspiring either, and severely repetitious.  On the plus side you've got 'Electric Eye' and 'Screaming For Vengeance' both of which are just awesome.  Totally classic and utterly tight speed metal.  'You've Got Another Thing Coming' you've heard, for sure, but it still rocks, and is one of the best Priest songs that actually got airplay.  I also particularly the semi-ballad 'Fever'.  It's got kind of a classic rock feel to it, but it still rocks pretty hard, and is just loud and catchy like everything here.<br /><br />Yeah, this is a cool album.  Check it out.
B00006JIA4|3.0|Here is an example of overkill. <br />The original Queen greatest hits album/CD was very nearly the perfect greatest hits album. Every song was a classic. Every song fondly remembered or enthusiastically discovered. Top to bottom, all killer no filler. <br />The songs were only taken from the first eight Queen albums, which despite many fans' protestations, are the only real Queen albums anyone need own. <br />There are a smattering of songs selected from the later Queen period that belong with these hallowed songs, but they still pale in comparison. \\"Headlong\\" or \\"Hammer To Fall\\" come to mind. But the great Queen music was early, and it's power is diminished in this collection as those songs are diluted by the presence of so many weaker tracks, as well as the omission of some great ones. <br />Consider the first disc: The presence of \\"Save Me\\" or \\"Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy\\" or \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" deters from stone-cold classics like \\"Rhapsody\\", \\"Another One Bites...\\" or \\"We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions\\". Sure, you might be sick of them already, but the reason you are is that they are still played ad nauseum on the radio/TV/film circuit. <br />It would have been nice to add things like \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\", but that's quibbling. <br />Disc 2 show the decline in the quality of their music. No one gets elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame based on this set list, if you know what I mean. It's not that it's that bad, it's just so bland and weak compared to their earlier stuff. There's a few things to like, but overall, kind of a yawn. <br />Disc 3 blows from beginning to end. Seriously. Some of the live tribute stuff is partially interesting, but the majority is an absolute chore to listen through. <br /> <br />My overall impression is a re-appreciation for their classic early stuff...a need to check out the individual albums these songs came from...and being totally comfortable ignoring the majority of their post \\"The Game\\" catalog. <br /> <br />

B000301YY8|1.0|James Blunt pretty much just sucks in every way imaginable.  I'm actually sad that I have to write such a negative review, but believe me; I mean every word I write.  If you're not familiar with the newest form of bastardization of the English-language folk music scene, let me introduce you to James Blunt. If his whiny falsetto isn't enough to turn you off, might I entreat y'all to examine his terrible, hackneyed songwriting.  Take for instance that song that's getting all that airplay right now \\"Your Beautiful\\"    She smiled at me on the subway.  She was with another man.  But I won't lose no sleep on that,  'Cause I've got a plan.  You're beautiful. You're beautiful.  You're beautiful, it's true.     Not only are his melodies bland, and more than a little reminiscent of the middle school dance scene, (the phrase talent-less hack comes to mind) his terrible lyrics are really just a long chain of complete non-sequiters (basically, he begins a premise with some potential and follows it up with some fugly chorus).  The words really don't make any sense.   Where does this chorus come from?  Lyrically, it's a complete non-sequiter - it has nothing to do with the line above it.  You expect when someone sings \\"I've got a plan\\" they're going to tell you something about the plan, maybe embellish the idea a bit.  Not James Blunt.  He just kind of does his own thing, which unfortunately doesn't make any sense.      Additionally, the first for lines of the song are just annoying.  He repeats them like they should have some emphasis, but unlike the title of the song, you just cant get whatever Blunt is trying to say when he first opens his mouth.  You hear \\"my life is brilliant,\\" and you think: \\"yeah, and...?\\" sadly, that's his style.  the lyrics make no sense either poetically or concretely.      And the singing...  Who said this guy could sing!?  I might be able to look past the terrible lyrics for a little while but when the singing is this bad its really hard.  I actually cannot sit down and listen to this album in one sitting simply because his voice gives me a headache.  He really reminds me of a cat in heat, or like some poor creature being tortured.  Now understand me, I have nothing wrong with falsetto.  I think it can be a really good style of singing, and often serves as an asset to many talented popular and even Broadway artists.  Mandy Patinkin, Ben Folds, and Keane's Tom Chaplin all do it amazingly well, the latter two working it into what really is all that's left of modern pop music of any merit.  Blunt, on the other hand wails - lacking Chaplin's control or Ben's finesse, let alone talent.      He's often compared to Damien Rice, the largest difference being that Rice makes the best of his voice by backing it up with heartfelt lyrics and stirring songs.  When Rice breaks into falsetto you immediately know that it means something.  With Blunt, the opposite is true.  The words \\"you're beautiful\\" or \\"goodbye my lover\\" mean nothing in the context of the song.  When Blunt breaks into falsetto in these respective choruses, its like an indication that this part of the song doesn't really mean anything, making his voice in these sections sound all the more contrived and cheesy.      Blunt has all of the fluff and none of the substance of these aforementioned artists.  What's worse is that he appears to be trying his hardest to appears like a legitimate talent...failing thoroughly.  Again, I may be wrong, but rhyming couplets scream bad writing in 2006.  It really reminds me of kindergarten songs.  It's too sing-songy for serious music, though I would be curious to see how successful he could be if he were to produce a children's album.  Bob Dylan pulled them off, but then again, he has legendary lyrics.  I don't think anyone could pull off:    I am a dreamer and when i wake,  You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.  And as you move on, remember me,  Remember us and all we used to be    Indeed I think you have to havesome degree of childish naïveté to find merit in this crap.  So in conclusion: don't pay for this man's music, but listen to it, form your own opinion, but just remember that he sucks, whatever you might believe to the contrary. If you really feel it necessary to listen to something like this, or at least what I believe James Blunt was going for I suggest the less poppy and more satisfying Damien Rice.

0385338694|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is a truly gifted writer of comedic fiction. Not only is she hilariously funny, but she's consistently so. Her 4-book SHOPAHOLIC series, starring spendthrift Becky Bloomwood, and CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?, featuring ditzy marketing professional Emma Corrigan, have provided me with hours of chuckles. Here, in THE UNDOMESTIC GODDESS, Sophie has created a soul-sister for Becky and Emma.<br /><br />Samantha Sweeting is a gifted but overworked associate lawyer slaving for the prestigious London law firm of Carter Spink. Samantha hasn't had a day off in years, but her dedication appears about to pay off with a promotion to \\"partner\\". But, on the Big Day, she discovers that she's apparently made a horrific mistake - the only one of her career to date - that'll cost a client 50 million quid. Stunned, she flees the law offices in shock and takes the first Paddington train to anywhere, in this case Gloucestershire. Stumbling off the rail carriage in the rural hamlet of Lower Ebury with a monstrous headache, she totters to the door of a grand old house seeking water and an aspirin. The first words from the woman who answers the bellpull are, \\"Are you from the agency?\\" A case of mistaken identity, plus some harmless white lies told and dodgy decisions made under stress by Sweeting, result in her being hired by Trish and Eddie Geiger as their new housekeeper. The thing is, you see, Samantha can't even so much as boil water, sew on a button, operate a clothes washer, or iron a shirt.<br /><br />In a certain sense, Becky, Emma, and Samantha are all cut from the same endearing cloth - only the heroines' names, professions, and foibles change. However, perhaps reflecting Kinsella's evolving skills as a wordsmith, THE UNDOMESTIC GODDESS may be Sophie's finest offering in the sense that Samantha is a more fully developed character than the other two. With her legal career in smoking ruins, Sweeting fumblingly clutches the lifeline presented by her second vocation as a household domestic. In the process, she finds love, rediscovers life's little pleasures, and matures. And in one sweaty sequence, Sophie describes the amorously seductive power of raspberry picking that left me wondering if it derived from the author's personal experience. By the volume's conclusion, Samantha is positioned to dictate her life rather than vice versa.<br /><br />All of Kinsella's novels are chick books best read by Real Men on the sly behind an opened gent's magazine or sports page. But be careful not to guffaw out loud.c. In the process, she finds love, rediscovers life's little pleasures, and matures.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is, perhaps, the most powerful movie of the year, which takes the audience on a beautiful but sad emotional roller-coaster ride. It is a tragic romance in the vain of Romeo and Juliet, or is that Romeo and Romeo. Take out the petty, feuding Montagues and Capulets and substitute the vicious stereotypes of 1960's Middle America, complete with gay bashing, homophobia, and self-doubt. This movie is shocking commentary on how far we have come and, if you want to know how far we still have to go, just look to the movie's R rating. There is nothing in this movie that deserves the R rating. It is given that rating solely for the reason that the two main characters are both males. There is very little sex and nothing particularly graphic. It is simply a love story. It is sad that our society is so quick to show children men killing each other, yet so hesitant to show them falling in love.
1400032717|3.0|While I admire the book's attempt to tell a story from an unusual perspective, it's just not that compelling a story. It also reflects the trend of these kind of \\"book club books\\" that are kind of simple to read and told from the perspective of an adolescent (two other examples being The Secret LIfe of Bees and Life of Pi). But as a narrative and human story, it was just so-so for me.  <br /> <br />To see just how flat these modern novels told from a child's perspective really are (from the literary and emotional perspectives), read Huckleberry Finn or To Kill a Mockingbird, and see if you can really give novels like The Curious Incident . . . 5 stars. Come on, now!
B000AP04FG|4.0|Mr. and Mrs. Smith are hired killers and are unaware that they share a profession.  John is supposedly in construction while Jane is supposedly in computer maintenance.  Their secret lives are much different.  They each thought the marriage would provide good cover for their own covert actions but are now going to a marriage counselor.  We get a good look at how they started together and how they got where they are.  Then they are both hired for the same hit and get in each others way.  Now they each have forty-eight hours to eliminate the other before their companies eliminate them. <br /> <br />They manage to track each other down and are surprised to learn their spouse is now what they thought.  A misunderstanding then drives them into a series of maneuvers where they keep trying to kill one another.  But all of this give each of them a chance to explore what their feelings really are for each other.  Honesty begins to be a part of their communication and things get more complex.  As the relationships build so does the action until everything is neatly wrapped up. <br /> <br />This is not another True Lies although there are some obvious similarities.  The therapy framework as well as the flashbacks and humor help make the film unique and not a retreatment of old ideas.  The change in personas between the real and the cover personalities is also very well done and believable.  This helps cement the rest of the film.  All in all a good film that works well as an action film and as a romantic film.  Check it out.
B000005RMY|5.0|I remember when I first saw this album in the \\"New Release\\" section of the \\"Alternative\\" aisle at my local record store (which was over 10 years ago, by the way). I about flipped my wig because I thought the Sisters had . . . finally . . . followed up \\"Vision Thing\\" with a surprise new release! Well, I was still pleasantly surprised to see that it was merely a collection of their early singles and EPs, but I was admittedly a bit let down that it wasn't a shiny new release. Still, \\"Some Girls Wander By Mistake\\" is ESSENTIAL for your Sisters collection.<br /><br />Prior to this very inclusive collection, the only format many of the Sisters' early releases were available on was vinyl. This certainly wasn't a problem for me as I had a rather nice Thorens turntable at the time. The problem was, however, that these early singles and EPs were quite hard to find---not impossible---just a bit hard to track down. For those who didn't have a turntable, or didn't want the hassle of one, simply had to live without such stellar songs as \\"Alice,\\" \\"1969,\\" or \\"Gimme Shelter.\\" The release of \\"Some Girls Wander by Mistake\\" changed all of that . . . well, almost. But I'll get to that later. Okay, so what DO you get with this CD? Well, I'll give you the list:<br /><br />1. 1980's \\"The Damage Done\\" 3-track single.<br />2. 1982's \\"Body Electric/Adrenochrome\\" single.<br />3. 1983's \\"Anaconda/Phantom\\" single.<br />4. 1983's \\"Alice\\" 4-track single (more like an EP).<br />5. 1983's \\"The Reptile House E.P.\\" with 6 tracks.<br />6. 1983's \\"Temple of Love\\" 3-track single.<br /><br />This is, as you can easily tell, quite an extensive collection. Now, on one convenient CD, you can own what would likely have set you back between $50 to $100 (or maybe even more) from searching out all of these original songs on vinyl.<br /><br />Will this complete your Sisters collection? Nope! For God only knows what reason, the wonderful 1984 single, \\"Body and Soul,\\" is completely missing.

Of course, none of the \\"other\\" songs (B-sides) included on the singles from the Sisters' three studio albums are found here either.

And guess what--- these B-sides are as good as the singles!!!<br /><br />So what is a poor Sisters of Mercy fan to do? Why, buy a bootleg of course! True, you can continue to hunt down ALL of the vinyl and CD singles from all three albums but you will pay a king's ransom . . . believe me.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|I'm from the other side of the world, and I still found plenty of characters and situations to relate to in this film. <br /> <br />The first time I saw it, I didn't laugh all that much either, but I found myself quoting lines from it and telling people about it.  The humour grew on me bit by bit. <br /> <br />The second time I watched it, I picked up on subtle elements (yes, it has those) that I hadn't seen the first time.  And I enjoyed it even more. <br /> <br />If you do watch it - definitely check out the special features.  <br /> <br />Turn the commentary on, and learn the backstory behind the film and the process of writing and filming it.  Jon Heder and Jared Hess both have interesting things to say about the project, and recount stories from their lives which tie in with scenes in the film. <br /> <br />Also, when you realise that half the people in the movie were local towns folk, it gives it an extra dimension.   <br /> <br />The teachers are played by real teachers from the school.  The school cafeteria in the movie is real, and apparently makes a decent chili. <br /> <br />The houses are real, inside and out. And just about every scene has a story behind it and features at least one of the seemingly endless number of brothers of the crew. <br /> <br />I was surprised at how many real life residents of Preston they used - they've done a brilliant job and delivered very believable performances. <br /> <br />I particularly loved that every person in the film got a credit - even the kids in the auditorium scene :) <br /> <br />I recommend it, and I have to say that I do feel sorry for those who \\"don't get it\\" becuase you're really missing out on something great.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Good follow up for lateralus. It starts fast and heavy with Vicarious, then It increases its mysticism and punches you out with Jambi. After those 2 you have to wait up to song # 5 \\"The pot\\" to get hyped and interested again. (songs 3 and 4 are just mediocre for tool standards). The next couple of tracks divagate back and forth through genius and ordinary gaps of sound. Now, Rosetta Stoned could very well be the best track on the album, but it fails in the end. The last 2 tracks \\"Intension\\" and \\"Right in two\\" are pretty solid and leave a good zoom in your ears. Note that I'm not counting \\"Viginti Tres\\" as a formal song, because it isn't. That one is just noise. <br /> <br />Bottom-line, you can feel that the magic is still there, but especially the guitar fails to follow the rest of the instruments (including Maynard's magnificent voice) dropping on repetitive and plain. <br /> <br />The booklet is great. It worth's every penny, but if you want to find the best of Tool, buy Aenima. <br />
0553277472|4.0|This is an extraordinary book. It is the story of a man who sets out to \\"find the Truth\\" and actually succeeds!    But not many people have appreciated the true significance of this work. Sadly that includes Pirsig himself, judging by the Afterword. They talk about the '70s, the hippie generation, counter-culture, etc. ZAMM has nothing to do with all that! I repeat: it is the story of a man who sets out to find the Truth and succeeds. Pirsig starts off as a typical Westerner, swearing by logic and reason. But he ends up as a mystic, in the Eastern tradition.    There are quite a few criticisms that can be levelled against Pirsig's approach. Though he refuses to define 'Quality' it is clear that initially he means it to be something similar to 'Beauty'. Then suddenly (and conveniently) 'Quality' becomes 'Truth'. Eh? Also, his interpretation of ancient Greek thought - that Plato buried 'Good' with his concept of 'Truth' - is questionable. Mainstream opinion is that the Socrates-Plato-Aristotle trio fathered the dualism (Good/Evil) of the Western mind, as against the monism (Truth) of the East.    Still, the book is not without its strong points. Though the search for Truth is a highly individual and subjective quest, one can always gain insights from another's journey.
B000F48CD8|3.0|If you can get your hands on \\"Steady as She Goes,\\" \\"Broken Boy Soldiers,\\" and \\"Store Bought Bones,\\" you've got it made. Those songs have the fire of rock mixed with pop saavy that make for a great recording. The rest of the songs suffer in comparison. <br /> <br />Jack White has made a career out of paying homage to Rock past, and often he pulls this off with stunning success. While his passion is unassailable and his instincts true, at times it can sound a bit too imitative. It's a fine line to walk and I applaud him for doing so; what makes the above-mentioned songs great is their ability to sound classic and current in equal measure.  <br /> <br />Still, there's also something off-putting about having a few relatively straight blues songs on a record with such catchy pop cuts. Now that I think about it, I feel the same about the White Stripes: I just can't buy the more straight-up bluesisms. <br /> <br />Frankly it seems to me Brendan Benson holds this project back somewhat. His second song, \\"Hands,\\" is kind of compelling, but never develops. It never changes once from its first 10 seconds--never. And it suffers, as do all of Benson's songs, from weak lyrics. \\"Store Bought Bones\\" may be sung by Benson, but don't try to tell me what makes that song rock is not Jack White. It's nice that White is a team player, I'm sure Benson has some musical sensibilities, but they are definitely not equals, no matter how hard their press works to emphasize this. <br /> <br />Having heard \\"Steady as She Goes\\" and \\"Store Bought Bones,\\" I was ready for the arrival of the next great power pop band. The Raconteurs definitely have the talent on hand to be one but this record is not all there.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|This is like having Queen for the 21st Century.  Having been in their shoes, I hope their young age doesn't make them fall prey to typical newbie mistakes though, first point being the separation from their bassist.  I don't know what the reasons really were but the timing is awful and even though people may think a bass player is expendable, chemistry can sometimes never work the same again even with a more skilled musician.  The album is amazing; mature writing and skillful execution.  Highlights for me are \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\\", \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom And Suicide Is Press Coverage\\" and of course \\"I Write Sins, Not Tragedies\\".  The fact that they're not hard to look at doesn't hurt either.

B000F5GNX8|3.0|for the script, if you could let go of yourself of all the logic and decide to have a good time before stepping into the dark theatre, then this movie is quite all right and sometimes funny. but robert downey jr. or the screenplay writer turn director, both failed to make funny things convincingly believable. the most bothering scenario and the scenes that bothered me so much was the left pinky finger, broken so easily by a shutting door, broken so evenly, at that moment it's still fine with me.<br /><br />but at least downey jr should act that's really hurt. because one of the most painful things in the world is hurt one of your fingers, albeit a finger totally broken off from your hand, i think that might make a guy faint, and the pain would not go away so easily and so fast. re-attaching the finger back in an emergency room by just one nurse? still fine with me. but from the moment that finger fell to the floor to that finger reattached back to his hand, downey jr. still kept using his left hand so naturally comfortable, that's an unacceptable big overlook. i'd like you to watch carefully how and why robert downey jr was a good actor but never a great one. he could only  focus on interpretating a certain part of the character he played but never did a thorough study and control of how and when he should look more legit or more believable to perform that character. great actors always covered all the basis he played with consistency and logic. like this broken finger, a good actor and a good director could both do a lot good on this scenario, but in this movie, they both lost it. downey jr. kept forgetting that he got a useless left hand with a broken finger and the director never reminded him that he should be more conscious about his left hand by not using it too much or not at all; not even let his left arm drop down, guy with a broken finger would never let that hand drop straight downward, because that throbbing pain would be too much to be bearable.<br /><br />the screenplay is not a serious one and almost every setting is full of inconsistency and bad logic, sometimes even very ridiculous.  the matured val kilmer actually acted better and better and he never exaggerated the acting and overdid anything, his performance was very solid in this melodrama.reenplay is not a serious one and almost every setting is full of inconsistency and bad logic, sometimes even very ridiculous.  the matured val kilmer actually acted better and better and he never exaggerated the acting and overdid anything, his performance was very solid in this melodrama.

0060763280|1.0|I borrowed this book from a friend and was very happy that I did not spend my money on it. I found this book to be a total waste of time. Many of the things he wrote about you can find online for free.  <br /> <br />I found the \\"The Wealth Files: Seventeen Ways Rich People Think and Act Differently from Poor and Middle-Class People\\" to be filled with assumptions. Some of the people who are Rich received an inheritance and never really did anything to benefit their money such as Paris Hilton.  <br /> <br />The only person that is getting rich is T. Harv Eker.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I watched this show from the very first episode because its premise caught my attention and was pleasantly surprised by just how good it turned out to be. The two actors who play the Winchester brothers play very well off of one another and have great chemistry. Jensen Ackles, who plays the older brother is really the break out star of this show as his performances are outstanding. On the surface he appears to be little more than the smart ass big brother who simply wants to hunt down and destroy any supernatural creature he possibly can. It doesn't take long for us to see that Sam (the youngest) is not the only compassionate brother. They both want to find their father and avenge their mother's death as well as help others along the way. Add the character of the father to the mix and things get even more interesting. This show is not just about two demon-hunting brothers. It also skillfully explores the complicated relationship not only between the brothers, but between the brothers and their father as well. Supernatural only gets better and better as the season progresses and has become much more than just a monster of the week show. Every episode has wonderful, witty dialogue and unlike some other 'generic' horror/sci-fi shows targeted at younger audiences, Supernatural purposely tries to be different and to stand out from the crowd (and succeeds). By the end of this first season, I was completely enthralled by the storylines and looked forward to the show every week. The action only gets better and better until the season finale that leaves you wondering, what are the Winchesters going to do next and how will they possibly top this in season 2?
1857028899|5.0|Frankly speaking, I got interested in cryptography after reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"; and so I \\"set upon\\" a task to master as much of Cryptography as possible. I was seaching for cyptography books on Amazon.com and none of the books seemed to suite me. Some of them were either too complex for an amateur or too costly for a student like me, until I came across this masterpiece. Although the cover of the book does not justice to the quality of writing Simon Singh has produced, this is without doubt one of the best books for amatuer \\"budding\\" cryptographers. <br /> <br />Without baffling the reader with technical terms and complex words, Simon Singh has made the apparently \\"complex\\" Code-Book surprisingly readable and that's where the genius of this man lies. This book makes for a wonderful read if you're new to the world of Cryptography. This book virtually traces the entire evolution of codes from the time of Mary Queen Of Scotts to modern day computer cryptography and Quantum Computers of the future. Although at first sight the book might seem \\"incomprehensible\\", everything in the book is so well explained that even a ten year old can get it. And once you do, I bet you'll start preparing your own codes, encrypting your name maybe! <br /> <br />Anyway, from the first page of the book you tend to get the true essence of what codes meant to people since the beginning of civilisation. The \\"steganographic\\" techiniques, the \\"Caesar's cipher\\" and so many others and everything is so deftly explained! <br /> <br />Overall I would say, you won't lose a penny if you buy this book.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Great wake up call to the problems that are faced in the third world countries and the corruption that are placed there deep in its roots. Fernando Meirelles creates an atmosphere of paranoia and fear that is rooted in reality and the story is presented in all of its grim reality. Rachel Weisz is captivating and fierce and her performance is a mixture of strong will, mystery and humanity. Her performance is the best performance of the year and I doubt we will see a better performance than hers by anyone this year. Ralph Fiennes is also great in a performance that mixes vulnerability, grief and risky disposition. He complements Weisz all the way and this is easily the best performance Fiennes has given in quite sometime. Their love story not only draws you into the horrors that this movie has but gives you hope as well by knowing that love still exist in even the worse of places as well as justice.
B00005JKGK|4.0|I was told to watch this film after I told someone I loved Memoris of a Geisha and I really liked this one. Told through mostly flashbacks the film tells the story of 4 elederly chinese women as they look back on there lives in China and then when they live in the us, the story then goes on to there children and they show how they live there lives. The film shows how the mothers are all in there children and then show the heartbreak and joyfullness of family. The story is wonderfull and will get you hooked from begging to end. The acting is great from each actress but the flawe is the film is long and I was ready for it to end. But overall it's agreat film to be watch by everyone.

I don't like reading about kids with personal problems unless there is a lesson involed in it. Christopher Boone was a very spastic thinker and it was very hard to connect with the character.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|In the last chapter of \\"The World According to Garp,\\" John Irving tells us what happens to all of the characters who survive the death of the title character.  One of these is Roberta Muldoon, a transsexual who was once a tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles.  After Roberta's death there is a moment of silence before the team's next came and one of the announcers says that Roberta \\"didda lot for people wid complicated lives.\\"  But in the world of transsexuals, Roberta Muldoon has nothing on Bree Osbourne (Felicity Huffman), who is one week away from her surgery when \\"Transamerica\\" begins.<br /><br />Bree is short for Sabrina, which is the name that Stanley has chosen.  The only problem is that she suddenly gets a phone call and learns that 17 years ago during the one sexual encounter that probably confirmed she was in the wrong body, she fathered a son, Toby (Kevin Zegers), who is in jail.  This bolt from the blue is upsetting enough, but her therapist (Elizabeth Pena) insists that Bree must meet the son and come to terms with the situation before the surgery can be allowed.  So Bree travels from Los Angeles to New York to get Toby out of jail.  She can hardly tell the boy that she is his father, so she says instead that she has been sent from a Christian group to save his soul.  Toby needs saving because unsatisfied with being a street hustler his ambition is now to become a porn star.  Consequently, a car ride to Los Angeles sounds like a great idea to him.  Of course ride gives Bree and Toby a chance to find out about each other before the truth of their relationship is revealed.<br /><br />If there is anything that anybody knows about \\"Transamerica\\" it is Huffman's Oscar nominated performance, and while it is impossible to quantify how many Academy voters actually saw the film or how many think of her as either being \\"just\\" a television actress or the role as being similar to what recent Oscar winners in the Best Actress category have done, it is hard not to feel that those were part of the equation that would explain why she did not win.  It might take you a couple of viewings to really appreciate what she is doing here in playing a man trying to be a woman, because a lot of it is subtle work.  But it is a captivating performance and Huffman is helped by the script that director Duncan Tucker (\\"The Mountain King\\") has written, which makes it clear that Bree does not just want to be a woman, she wants to be a lady.  That sensibility is key in her interactions with Toby as is how the situation confronts her with a third option, namely being a mother, even if the great irony here is that she is his father.<br /><br />\\"Transamerica\\" has its comic moments, most notably when Bree and Toby end up at her parent's house, where her father, Murray (Burt Young) says they still love their son, but her mother, Elizabeth (Fionnula Flanagan) quickly adds that they do not respect him.  But the key encounter for Bree comes at the low point in the journey, when getting back to Los Angeles in time for her operation seems like it is not going to happen, and she meets Calvin (Graham Greene).  The easy way of describing what happens is that Calvin hits on Bree.  But what is important is that he acts like a gentleman, which means he treats her like a lady.  I think this is a pivotal moment because if she can be a lady, then everything else is within her reach as well.  Final Note:  When I first saw the DVD cover I could not believe they would have a photograph of Huffman and not as her character, but it turns out this is one of those covers where the two images switch back and forth depending on how you are looking at them.  Still, the point is to forget the actress is playing the character, so I still find it a bit tacky (can you imagine them doing it for John Hurt in \\"The Elephant Man?\\").re part of the equation that would explain why she did not win.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Well what can I say about this album its truly amazing both disks are great, Id be a liar if I said I liked it straight away that wasn't the case it took about 3 to 4 listens and the more I listened the more it became amazing to me these songs on this album have got to be some of the greatest songs the red hot chilli peppers have done,  <br /> <br />Personally californication was my favourite album I cant say enough about that album but stadium arcadium seems to take them to another level on this album they have a experimented a lot and it seems to pay of for them Johns guitar solos are out of this world they have a Jimi Hendrix feel to them which is great.  <br /> <br />My personal favourites on the album are to many tracks to name that's how good the album is the list would never stop if I had to choose one song I couldn't.  <br />It really gets me that critics say they will never top blood sugar sex magix before the album even comes out the chilis have moved on since then and have become a better band and to be honest in my opinion I think californication and by the way are better albums.  <br /> <br />Overall stadium arcadium is the red hot chili peppers masterpiece album and in my opinion there best work to date I never thought id say that after californication but its true I'll just make a small list if I can of the best tracks on the album. Great Album  <br /> <br />1 Especially in Michigan  <br />2 Tell Me Baby  <br />3 Slow Cheetah  <br />4 Hard to Concentrate  <br />5 Storm in a Teacup <br />6 Dani California <br />7 Hey <br />8 We Believe  <br />9 Readymade <br />10 She looks to me  <br /> <br />(And the other 18 tracks) Classic Album <br />
0792844890|2.0|Spaceballs was a riot in theaters, but that was at age seven, when Garbage Pail Kids and drawing on my bedroom wall in crayon were funny too. While GPKs have stood the test of time, and I still, uh, decorate apartments sometimes, Spaceballs has not. Don't get me wrong, I like Mel Brooks films, Blazing Saddles first and foremost. Even the biggest fans must concede this isn't his best work. There's only one genuinely funny joke, referenced in my title, during the duel between Lonestar and Dark Helmet. Spoofing the big budget science fiction genre should have produced a goldmine in Mel's hands, but unfortunately it didn't, and we the viewers are left with a film packed with cringe inducing sight gags and failed attempts at wit. So, outside of children and jocks, (basically the same thing, no?) your humble corrospondant can't recommend this as a comedy. I'll be generous and give it two stars for nostalgia. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a portrait of Giant Gonzalez to finish in the hallway.

0441009425|5.0|For a sweeping, \\"star-spanning\\" space adventure, Alastair Reynolds's \\"Revelation Space\\" is awfully claustrophobic. Much of the action takes place underground at an archeological site, in a jail cell, in cramped sections of starships, in space suits, and finally on a . . . let's just say a very strange place indeed.<br /><br />It's science is \\"hard,\\" but not, thankfully, hard to understand thanks to the skillful way the author, who has a PhD in astronomy, unveils things for his readers. The plotting is skillful and the characters, most of whom are obsessed and obsessive, are believeable.<br /><br />You'll encounter politics, ancient sites, ancient civilizations, multiple points of view, artificial intelligence, self-replicating machines, nanotech, and speculations about the spread of sentient life through the galaxy.<br /><br />Everything revolves around the obsessions of archeologist Dan Sylveste, who's determined to find out what destroyed a civilization that appeared to be ready for prime time space travel. Most of the other characters--with one major exception--wish he would do anything but, but thankfully (for readers) his determination carries him quite a long way, despite their best efforts. (Indeed one of the book's many charms is that everybody's best-laid plans are never quite good enough.) Among those who attempt to divert Sylveste are Khouri--she's a professional assassin who's sent by the mysterious character known only as \\"The Mademoiselle\\" to stop him--and Volyova, the most clever among the characters, who's in charge of the star ship Khouri seeks work on in order to get to Sylveste. The story is told from their three viewpoints in separate sequences that all merge eventually.<br /><br />The science, as Mr. Reynolds portrays it, seems almost like magic, especially in one scene, where some of the characters make a descent from a space ship to a planet in AI-equipped space suits.<br /><br />The looooong (585-page) tale is billed as the first of a trilogy, but it's complete in itself, and most everything is tied up very well indeed.of a trilogy, but it's complete in itself, and most everything is tied up very well indeed.

The portrait he painted of the future in this novel is remarkably acurate in our world today, 14 years shy of the running man's. King prophecized a number of things including, reality television with cruel overtones, media influence over gov't, the use of airplanes as weapons, and air pollution. This was a thoroughly enjoyable read that was far superior to and much different than the movie.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|I skipped this movie at the theatre. Gay cowboys, what a weird idea I thought. Some remarks of friends of mine made me curious, so I gave it a try. What can I say?  Ang Lee did a great job, portraying these two guys in love. He did it so masterfully that I totally forgot that the two leadings are men. It appeared so natural, that I felt, that they were made for each other and no one else. Ang Lee is simply a genius.    The acting is another strength of this movie. Roberta Maxwell as Jake's mother is perfect. Look at her facial expressions when she realizes who Ennis is. You can see her pain, when Ennis leaves, because she knows that another part of her son is gone now forever. Absolutely heartbreaking.   Ledger did most challenging job and he was definitely the right one to do it. Who would have ever thought what a great actor he is? He played this Ennis del Mar so perfectly and nuanced that you actually think he IS Ennis del Mar! Bravo! I will never forget the scene, when he asks his daughter, if her husband loves her. Just for a few seconds you can see all his sorrow and regret in his face. I had tears in my eyes.    Bokeback Mountain is one the saddest but at the same time one the most beautiful movies I have seen in my life. If you see it and like it, I encourage you to watch it twice. There are so many details I missed upon the first viewing that the movie got better the second time I saw it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|How is this network even still alive?  They have the most incompetent decision makers on the face of the planet.  Airing episodes out of order?  What bozo came up with that idea?  But hey, Family Guy had huge support post-cancellation, and look at it now! <br /> <br />But I digress. <br /> <br />I, too, never learned of Firefly while it was on the air.  But I saw Serenity at a friend's house and was intrigued, so I bought the DVD set and like so many others, I was hooked after the very first episode.  Normally I'm not into sci-fi type programs, but the richness of this show's story, its characters and everything overall is just so great.  You immediately connect with the characters.  I laugh out loud at some scenes (a rare thing for me), and sit on the edge of my seat for others (\\"Out of Gas\\" is a good example). <br /> <br />I've had the DVD set for 3 days and I've already watched two-thirds of the episodes, and it saddens me to know that there isn't any more beyond that.  I can only hope that FOX pulls their collective heads out of their you-know-what and sees the popularity that this show has gained since their terribly misguided decision to cancel this true gem of a television show.  Bring back Firefly!
B000002LTU|3.0|I had purchased the cassette tape version of the album when it initially was issued. My feelings remain the same now as then that there simply was not enough recorded in the studio while Miles was alive for an album's length of material.<br /><br />It would have been a dynamite EP with a second side containing unreleased live material from his last year on the road.<br /><br />Miles was always a musician who wanted to expand his horizon, which mostly led to critics/fans panning many projects, but seemingly catching up with him years later. For those digging Miles for the first time, the release is not the place to start.<br /><br />But it is a CD you will want in your collection at some point to appreciate where Miles was going musically in the studio in the last year of his life.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|By now everyone knows the story of this superb little film, a road film unlike any other that dares to approach the distances we create from each other in an attempt to find ourselves, learn to love ourselves, and thus be able to love others.  It is a powerful film balanced with comedy and drama in just the right proportions to keep it sailing along above the speed limit.<br /><br />Bree (Felicity Huffman) is in the final stages of her transsexual transformation, having completed the cross-dressing requirement, the hormones, the facial surgeries, and the psychological counseling with Margaret (Elizabeth Pena), and is ready for her long awaited gender transformation surgery.  Abruptly she receives a call from New York authorities, who have in custody a lad arrested for hustling and drugs, who claim Bree  to be the father.  Unwillingly at first (her surgery date is could be affected) she is convinced by her therapist Margaret that she must confront this part of her past before her doctor will sign for the surgery.  She flies to New York, claims her son Toby (Kevin Zegers) without allowing Toby to know the truth, and acting the role of a church lady is ultimately committed to driving him to California.  A quick stop in Kentucky reveals Toby's sad background (his mother committed suicide and his stepfather abuses him sexually), and Bree is determined to rescue Toby from all this.  The trip to California is interrupted by a stop with Bree's grossly dysfunctional parents and sister (Fionnula Flanagan, Burt Young, Carrie Preston) who though ashamed of Bree's life choice are taken with their 'new' grandson.  Toby has been a difficult passenger, doing drugs, seeing Bree with her male genitals showing, witnessing a Mary Kaye party with transsexuals, etc, but never the less he and Bree have bonded.  When Toby discovers that Bree is actually his father he naturally rebels, only to realize after Bree has had her surgery in California that Bree is the only family he has.<br /><br />Huffman gives a bravura performance as Bree, never stepping over the line of farce, always attentive to the role-playing that has usurped her life, always able to find the gentle comedy that occurs with Toby, make her introduction to a male suitor Calvin (Graham Greene) who offers the two a ride once their car is stolen a tender moment of vulnerability, and yet is able to show us the angst of the transsexual dilemma in a powerfully touching scene with the fine Elizabeth Pena.  Likewise, Kevin Zegers (a fine young Canadian actor with a long list of credentials in TV and film) is wholly credible as a lost youth with deep and longstanding emotional needs hiding behind a mask of street hustler. And the supporting cast is exactly that - brilliantly supporting.<br /><br />But the bulk of the kudos go to writer/director Duncan Tucker.  The screenplay is superbly written and the direction of this talented cast is so well focused that there isn't a wasted moment of film.  This is a story about the need for belonging, for being true to yourself, for loving yourself so that you can truly love others.  Many fine lessons here, and delivered in a package that is absolutely irresistible.  Highly recommended for all audiences.

0880796863|3.0|This was my first deck. The cards look 2 diminsional to me. The colours and inking are just too plain and confusing. I don't get enough depth in this deck as compaired to the Universal Waite. <br /> <br />The book that comes with it is pretty basic.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|You let Lucasfilm know how you feel by not purchasing another lame edition of the trilogy! Show your dissatisfaction by emailing or calling them !!! If they get enough complaints , then they'll finally listen. Stop giving your money to Lucas until he releases the original versions with 16x9 and some decent extras like deleted scenes. This is just another Jedi mind trick Lucas is throwing at you !! He knows how gullible you all are. Stop this madness now !!!!!
6305882592|4.0|Review no. 227. Main reason that I even decided to check out this classic 1971 film is of it's mere mention or two in the 'There's Something About Mary' blockbuster movie. Plus, the fact that I've heard several female friends, acquaintances, etc. mention now and again that they really enjoyed this title. Good comedy / drama would probably be the best description that I could think of. About two unlikely people who just happen to meet (by chance) at a funeral - a suicidal / spoiled rich kid Harold Chason (Bud Cort) and 79-year old / having a true zest for life Maude (Ruth Gordon). Amazing to see just how the two tend to get along just so well together. I, personally thought that Harold was a scream - the way he'd dream about - or perhaps act out a death wish several times. Maybe not a thrill every other minute but 'Harold And Maude' definitely has some fine acting and several rather humorous moments to cherish. See it with someone you care about. Quick footnote: I really liked the several Cat Stevens songs that were played through out this movie.
B000EHSVS2|3.0|Both Patton and the The Longest Day are 5 star movies with good extras but when i compared them to the old versions i was very disappointed with the image.  The new dvd on Patton has a less sharp picture and kinda of blurry and the colors are too red. The Longest Day also has a less than sharp picture and is too dark compared to the old one but it will fit your widesceen tv. <br />Good extras but could have done better with the image so i will keep both the old and new release.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus, released in 2001, has got to be one of the more groundbreaking musical releases since the mid-80's and early 90's. Lateralus is a long, well thought out musical masterpiece that draws parralels to Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" This whole record is just full of amazing progressive rock and it is nearly impossible to fathom that human beings actually wrote and then performed this type of music. Every song has layers and sub-layers and sub-sub-layers. For example, \\"Lateralis\\" is an epic masterpiece. The instrumentals are absolutely amazing and Maynard's lyrics are beyond good. The same goes for \\"The Grudge,\\" \\"The Patient,\\" \\"Schism,\\" \\"Parabola,\\" and \\"Reflection.\\" The rest of the CD is still very, very good. This is the CD that defines the new millenium. Tool almost slips between extremely heavy chaos to calm and beautiful music without the listener not even realizing it happened. When one first listens to Lateralus (or Tool in general) one is inclined to think \\"hey, what's the big deal? This is a)Boring b)a little too different or c)bad.\\" Trust when I say this, you have got to listen to Lateralus several times before you begin to realize that you are listening to musical genious. Some people may never realize that this is just as good (if not better) as any other rock/metal band ever listened to. If you like Green Day or Limp Bizkit you had better pass on this one and let real music fans talk about the most advanced musical journey that one may ever take!
0802136834|5.0|One of the best, if not the best, books written. Weir wrote about the six wives of Henry VIII in one book instead of six books. It may be thick, but it goes by quickly. It doesn't get old and boring like most books do. Any reader can see the heartbreak Katherine of Aragon and her daughter, Mary, go through. Mary goes through quite a bit of heartbreak when her father discards her mother. Elizabeth gets slightly better treatment.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Ok, so I really like Green Day, they always come up with great music and catchy lyrics and so I like this album although I don't really agree with a lot of the messages it's sending. Its pretty unpatriotic, I mean just be happy to live in America! But anyway, if you just don't obsess over the fact that they're not totally patriotic and they're anti-bush and just focus on the music then definitely get the CD. And if you're anti-bush yourself then you have to be sure to get it!!!!!!!!!!!! :) I for one don't really care. It's not my view, but its a view and Green Day has their right to express their view. And if they're going to express it, then I really appreciate that they express it using great music!!! (Oh, and right now, as I write this I'm listening to Boulevard of Broken Dreams) <br />
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Now don't get me wrong; I liked the original cut of this movie well enough, but there was always something missing.  Sure the costumes were wonderful and the battles were grand, but the story seemed to be just filler some of the time.      There were scenes clearly meant to evoke emotion, (Balion being knighted by his dying father comes to mind) but they mostly fell flat because there was almost no character development and very little interaction between the characters.  I have always believed the lack of emotional depth was this movie's undoing, but not anymore.    Don't get me wrong, this is still not the greatest film ever made, but the director's cut delves so much deeper into the characters that it actually breathes life into the stale and tired original version.    When you are dealing with the Christian side of the crusades as a film topic, you usually have only so many angles filmakers would choose from; you either make a film about those who were in it for the fame, land, and wealth, those who fought because they liked to kill, or you focus on those who wanted to wash their sins away through holy war.    Where as the original print made the characters mostly bad or mostly good, this new version delves a little deeper than before and shows that things were not so dichotomous, that sometimes there was more behind men's motivations than what met the eye.      If you saw the original Kingdom of Heaven and thought it needed a bit more to be either a good or a great film, then you might very well find this version more to your liking.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|The second disc of this release contains the movie as it was released in 1977; however it's non-anamorphic, which means that it won't display properly on a widescreen television. <br /> <br />Star Wars creator George Lucas, who doesn't mind tinkering with his own classics for special edition re-releases said, \\"I am very concerned about our national heritage, and I am very concerned that the films that I watched when I was young and the films that I watched throughout my life are preserved, so that my children can see them.\\"  <br /> <br />Does he know the definition of \\"hypocrite\\"? <br /> <br />Lynne Hale of Lucasfilm said,\\"...since these movies (as originally released) do not represent George's artistic vision, we could not put the extraordinary time and resources into this project as we did with the Special Editions. The 1993 Laserdisc masters represented the best source for providing the original versions as DVD bonus material. Although these are non-anamorphic versions, they do preserve the original widescreen composition of the movies.\\" <br /> <br />Believe it or not, George Lucas was not the only person involved in the making of these movies. Ask Ralph McQuarrie, John Dykstra, Gary Kurtz, Rick Baker, or Marcia Lucas. Star Wars (what Lucas now calls A New Hope) is a great movie that represents some of the best filmmaking of the 1970's. What Lucas is doing is completely disrespectful to all of those people that were involved in the process of making those films. He's completely disregarding their work and dishonoring their memory. <br /> <br />By the way, last weekend I watched the \\"2004 version\\" and I didn't think it held up. The scene where Luke and Ben enter Mos Eisley looks too busy and too cartoon-like, in other words, like CGI. The new scene with Jabba: it's redundant. It's a almost a word-for-word retread of the Greedo scene. <br /> <br /> <br />Lynne Hale of Lucasfilm also said, \\"We want you to be aware that we have no plans - now or in the future - to restore the earlier versions. <br /> <br />We hope you will understand our decision and, again, want to let you know how much we appreciate your interest and enthusiasm.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Okay Lynne Hale and George Lucas, I want you to be aware that I have no plans - now or in the future - to purchase your poor quality versions of the original movies. Furthermore, I and my family will NEVER spend another dime on any of your future movies. <br /> <br />Lucasfilm is a multi-billion dollar company and it's not willing to spend an extra hundred grand to make it's product better and it's fans happy with an anamorphic print? <br /> <br />Well Lucasfilm, we hope you will understand our decision and, again, want to let you know how much we don't appreciate your lack of interest and enthusiasm.
B00000K3CR|5.0|I have loved and watched this movie my entire life. It is a family classic - one of the few movies we have quoted and adored for an extended period of time. If you haven't seen it, buy it, and you will never be disappointed. <br /> <br />Weeweeweeweeweewee jacks!
B000EHRVP6|1.0|QUENTIN TARANTINO lent his name to this turkey?  Once upon a time there was a movie, \\"I Spit On Your Grave,\\" that drew scorn because of wantonly violent rape scenes and the victim's subsequent wantonly graphic revenge killings of the perpetrators.  That one at least had its revenge-justice motif and was not devoid of some other artistic elements.  This one is devoid of either, and has nothing of value beyond some Eastern European female eye candy.  It features pure gory snuff sadism lacking any BDSM eroticism whatever.  The young actors and acting are adolescent, every other word is fxxk or variants thereof and, judging from the commentary tracks, the geniuses who put this movie together are no better.  What a WASTE of effort, film and time.
B0002ZMITY|1.0|Ali G: meet Stuart Smalley, The Ladies Man, Pat, and the Butabi brothers.  You are now in the distinguished company of your SNL cousins from across the pond who turned funny 5 minute skits into full length movie suckfests.  Yes, Da Ali G show is hilarious, due mostly to its main character, Ali G.  His interviews with famous politicians and roundtable discussions with experts are never a disappointment.  You would therefore think that an Ali G who is funny in extemporaneous situations such as an interview would be even funnier in a movie which he scripted.  And you would be incorrect, sir!  The movie is a 90 minute mess.  The \\"plot\\" is mentioned elsewhere on this page, so no need for me to ridicule it.  But suffice it to say that the Ali G character here is a grating bore, lacking in wit or charisma.  If you like Ali G, you will not like this.
B000301YY8|4.0|One of the finest debut albums from a British artist in years, James Blunt's `Back to Bedlam' is packed full of great songs that are both emotional and stirring. There is much more to the album than it's biggest hit `You're beautiful', in fact, this is far from being Blunt's best song, as most of his fans will tell you. <br /> <br />It kicks off with the adrenaline rusher `High', proving within the first track that there is a song more complete and accomplished than the aforementioned hit. `Wisemen' is another great track, `Goodbye My Lover' a sentimental tear-jerker, and `Tears and Rain' is as good as any other single on the album. <br /> <br />After that, the standard drops a bit. The next three are probably the weakest on the album. You wonder if it is going to finish this way, but Blunt rescues himself with the closing two songs, `Cry' and No Bravery', the latter of which is based on his haunting experiences of his time spent in the army. <br /> <br />A great album, all in all, but I give it four stars for the weaker tracks that appear midway through. <br />
B000EDWKXS|2.0|Nothing. Not even a trailer. What a wasted opportunity for a commentary by West (who does do them -- he did one for When A Stranger Calls) or a retrospective featurette.<br /><br />All you do get with this extended version is additional dialogue between Cusack's character and a female law enforcement officer in a hanger, footage of a prison riot during the opening credits montage and a few more graphic shots of hapless inmates being killed during the course of the movie.
B000001ESN|3.0|Permanent Waves (1980) was the first CD where Rush seem to be reaching out to a wider audience. It seems designed to sound good on a small AM radio like one that would sit on a dresser or nightstand like a clock radio. It has a tinny (and tiny) high pitched sound and perhaps a 'cold' or 'clean' sound. For me, it's maybe just a little too radio friendly. Permanent Waves also predates, by a few of years, an era where many rock bands would add extra bass to their already heavy sound. Permanent Waves isn't one of my favorite Rush CDs. It's OK they reaching out to a larger audience, they would simply write and perform better on many later CDs.  Spirit of Radio - &#34;bright antenna bristle with the energy&#34; starts off Permanent Waves. Freewill a crunchier song which was also heavily played on AOR radio (album oriented rock), follows. Freewill seems as if it could be in part a reaction to the song Circumstances on their previous album. Rush grow environmentally conscious for Natural Science - &#34;Science like nature, must also be tamed... the most endangered species, the honest man, will still survive annihilation&#34;. Some lines on Natural Science I don't understand, &#34;In their own image/Their world is fashioned/No wonder they don't understand&#34;. With the ending (after the Tidal Pools' introduction of the song) a bit apocalyptic, &#34;Wave after wave will flow with the tide/And bury the world as it does/Tide after tide will flow and recede/Leaving life to go on as it was...  At 35 minutes and 35 seconds running time, this is one of their shorter albums (if not the shortest album they've done). I'm not a huge fan of The Spirit of Radio or Freewill. Jacob's Ladder and Natural Science seem like poor versions of previous experimental songs they've done on their previous albums A Farewell to Kings and Hemispheres. My favorite song on the CD is Entre Nous. It's difficult for me to listen to these songs objectively; it would be more interesting to see what first-timelisteners would think of them.  I have to admit to listening to Xanadu the other day with the window to my apartment open. I couldn't tell the difference between the birds chirping outside and those on the record at the beginning of the song. Obviously, they were the same kind of birds. I wondered if the song might be related to the bird's song somehow. Listening to Natural Science, bird-calls also begin alongside the music to the song. It sounds like some kind of Seagull but I bet it's not. Natural Science is broken up into 3 parts. The Avante Garde 2 minute long introduction 'Tidal Pools'. The frantic 'Hyperspace' from 2:25 to, really, about 5:28, and then the final 'Permanent Waves' from 5:28 to 9:09. Listening, I thought the first two notes of 'Hyperspace' could be the call of a bird or the bird heard at the beginning, but while listening, it appears the song is so very frantic, it is unlikely it is related to a bird's call. Going outside after listening I could hear birds cawing, it definitely sounded like the notes to the song. I suppose the odds are against this being true, that this is where the song comes from, but it is possible. Critically acclaimed band Mercury Rev have claimed they watch the nature channel on TV while writing their songs (perhaps they were only revealing half of the truth in regards to where their songs come from!). What is the line, &#34;Respond, vibrate, feed back, resonate&#34;? Now I have to play music for the birds every day, Jeez. They seem to like Xanadu. What is the line, 'A whole-wide-world, an endless universe, but we keep looking through the eyeglass in reverse'?
B000EMGAOY|5.0|After reading lead vocalist Anthony Kiedis' book, Scar Tissue, a couple of years ago, I never thought I'd hear another note come out of the collective musical genius of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. That's not the only thing that surprises me about their new two-disc, 28-set collection, Stadium Arcadium. The other surprise is that it's the most solid recording since their brilliant breakthrough third album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik from 1991. That hardly discounts their other efforts, most notably the sensational 1999 album, Californication, but I stand by my ears and say this is their best full recording to date. They have done what most bands do after being together for over two decades, they know how to play to each other's strengths, all the while being completely in-tune with each other. Reaching this plateau was no easy effort, but after hearing the opening track from disc 1,\\"Dani California,\\" I was more than hopeful. My hopes and dreams kept escalating with each passing track. One seemed to be more interesting and exciting than the next. The secret to this band's new music is that they haven't abandoned their signature sound, it's just been refreshed to keep with the times. Kiedis' vocals are superb and John Frusciante's brilliant guitar solos are present on just about every track. Flea's dazzling bass along with Chad Smith's masterful fingers holding his magical drumsticks rounds out this quintessential quartet's remarkable set. There are no lowlights on this two-hour journey, only highlights, including \\"Tell Me Baby,\\" \\"Make You Feel Better,\\" which has a nostalgic appeal that's hard to resist and arrives halfway through disc 2, along with the infectious \\"Hey,\\" and stunning ballad \\"If.\\" It's all here. Rock at its hardest, many must-hear mid-tempo masterpieces and a few solid and stunningly eerie ballads that'll knock you out. It's possible that the return of producer Rick Rubin (Neil Diamond and Dixie Chicks) had a lot to do with turning this collection into a stunning trip, but whatever the reason, they're all good enough to tout this as one of the best albums of the year...so far. After all, we're only halfway through. Stadium Arcadium is most definitely a five-star collection that I'm willing to bet will still be high on the charts well into the second half of 2006.ning trip, but whatever the reason, they're all good enough to tout this as one of the best albums of the year...so far.

B00005OM4K|5.0|The Creedence Clearwater Revival box set is very much a mammoth enterprise in its own right. Containing all seven original albums and two live albums, not to mention a whole disc full of material from their stints as Tommy Fogerty & The Blue Velvets and The Golliwogs, this is very much a unique offer. <br /> <br />All tracks have been superbly remastered, thus salvaging their legacy for forthcoming generations. Once you possess this set, you need not even browse through the other compilations, since all of it is here, and a little bit more. <br /> <br />The undoubted highlight of the set is the first disc, focusing on the pre-Creedence period. The Blue Velvets singles make their debut appearance here (the most devout Creedence fan may have noticed that the third single is absent, because of its scarcity). The Golliwogs singles made their first appearance on vinyl on the 1975 Pre Creedence compilation, which also included the first single under the name of Creedence Clearwater Revival. To top it all off, there are even extra tracks among the singles that prior to this set never saw the light of day: \\"I Only Met You Just An Hour Ago\\", \\"She Was Mine\\", \\"Gonna Hang Around\\", \\"Instrumental #1\\", \\"Little Tina\\", and \\"Try Try Try\\", which in all sound a lot different compared to the Blue Velvets material, which harked back to '50s style rock'n'roll. Another additional treat is the \\"abandoned\\" single \\"Tell Me\\"/\\"You Can't Be True\\" (second version) that was never released; the disc finishes off with an Action USA radio promotional spot. <br /> <br />The B-side of the first Creedence single \\"Porterville\\", \\"Call It Pretending\\", opens Disc 2, which, up to Disc 5, focuses on the original Creedence albums until reaching Tracks 3 and 4 on Disc 5. Probably the rarest of gems in the Creedence catalog, \\"45 Revolutions Per Minute (Parts 1-2)\\" was originally a promo disc recorded in late 1970 and distributed to radio stations. It is basically a group interview interspersed with added effects(not to mention a very amusing sequence where John Fogerty can be heard speaking backwards!) and musical backdrops to boot. This particular track is as yet not available elsewhere. The remainder of Disc 5 and the sixth (and last) one display Mardi Gras plus the two live albums In Concert and Live In Europe (with additional tracks apparently taken from Live In Germany, which was recorded at the same time period as Live In Europe). <br /> <br />Along with the discs is a full booklet with extensive liner notes and a review for each album, by various writers and chroniclers. The Early Years (by Alec Palao), especially makes for very interesting reading, with additional input from Stu Cook and Doug Clifford discussing the olden days. The only major shame is that John Fogerty did not contribute to the reminiscences. One could assume (given the current situation between him and the others) that he was not very much interested in their early history. Simply by reading the booklet it could easily evoke memories of a bygone era, especially among those who grew up listening to Creedence in the late '60s; without doubt one of the best and most significant bands America could ever boost. Therefore this box set is a milestone on behalf of their enduring legacy which ever continues to inspire and beguile thousands or even millions wherever Creedence is known, played, and loved. <br /> <br />Hats off to CCR!
0451529308|5.0|I had the great pleasure of reading the book \\"Little Women,\\" written by Louisa May Alcott, a story of real experiences and new feelings one experiences through the miracles of family and letting life take it's course; to live it to it's fullest. The March family is a true loving family who is as tightly woven as an old pair of blue jeans. In fact, they have as many stories to tell as old jeans that have been worn by so many. The March family had some hard times, but even burning of each others manuscripts can't put holes in their pockets. I believe this story is worth reading, because Louisa May Alcott defines si wekk in words how a family like the Marches can use their abilities for good and to learn a little more about life's true meaning. When I read this book I can see their life like I was a curious on-looker peering from behind a bookcase. I have become friends with these characters, and feel as if I had been a part of their noveled life. I became so engrossed in \\"Little Women,\\" when it was time for the light to go off I just realized that in fact I was not touring Europe with the Carroll's,  I was laying on my old lumpy mattress with sleep nipping expectantly at my eyelids. To be truthful, the books I had been reading, such as \\"Babysitters Club\\" or \\"Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots\\" hadn't been keeping me up so late that my light bulb flickered off with a sputter.  <br />There are not any faults in this wonderful story that my peering from behind the shelf could notice. It was as if Alcott wrote about her own real life and saw it from all her family's point of view.   <br />This book may be sad in some parts, but the blue jeans threads held it together. This was so inspirational to me I decided I should be a Beth or Jo. Maybe even a Meg or Amy. This book isn't just entertainment for the young (or even old) person's mind, but it is a lesson written to fit 400 pages. It can teach you about life, I recommend it greatly.  <br />I will not give away theending, but here is the summary: a dear family holds on to each other through thick and thin, and with their friend's help they still are a family. The family gets smaller then bigger, and the book ends with one sentence, \\"Oh my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this,\\" and this is where I end.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Let me preface by saying that I enjoyed the original cut, but I sensed that there was something missing, and I ended up forcing myself to like it more than I really did. I read several reviews of the Director's Cut from several critics who did not like the theatrical cut, and these men agreed. The Director's cut is something special.  <br /> <br />They are absolutely correct.  <br /> <br />If the FOX executives hadn't run their ignorant fingers over this film, it would have gotten the production budget back plus some, and probably netted Ridley Scott at least another Oscar nomination. And the director's cut would've been my favorite film of 2005, hands down. It really is that wonderful.  <br /> <br />The film reaches out and grabs you in a way the theatrical cut could not. The characters are now rich and full and several of the plot points carry more weight because they've been given greater context. Because the director's cut doesn't mean an extra 5 seconds of nudity and 3 minutes more of gore they had to cut out to get an R rating. In this case, it's an entire 45 minutes of subplots and characterization, because for whatever reason, FOX executives decided those weren't the reason people were going to see this movie. (And for the record, there is a bit more bloodspray, but nothing extravagantly violent. Still not a movie for the kiddies.) <br /> <br />In short, if you've seen the theatrical cut, at least give the director's cut a rental. If you liked the theatrical cut, then you must see this version to see what Ridley Scott truly wanted. And if you haven't seen this film yet, do not see any other version but the director's cut.  <br /> <br />Oh, and the fact that it's a 4 disc set and the extras are also highly informative and entertaining helps quite a bit.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|If your only Slipknot experience is from previous albums, it frankly has no bearing on this one (as I found out). This is a wholly different animal. The band has expanded in both style and expertise many times. Try it.
B000002G87|5.0|There are so many high points to this album. It's blues and upbeat, it's empathic and cold, it's love and lost love and love that can never be. I'm a big fan of Psychadelic rock, so I happen to listen to Cream, another of Clapton's bands in the '60s. That is how I became aware of this album. Don't be put off by it's \\"lovey-mushy\\" cover. This album is rock/blues at its best. This album is a must. The song \\"Layla\\" is on the list of \\"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\\" as voted by the readers of \\"Guitar World\\" magazine. There are other significant tracks like \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\" which is heavily bluesy, and \\"Why Does Love have to be So Sad\\" which is a more fast-paced song like \\"Layla\\". If you're a fan of Clapton, or Psychadelic rock, or blues, or rock at ALL, you need this.
B000002C25|3.0|The class of '97 saw some of Brit-pop's most important releases, with OK Computer, Urban Hymns, Blur and this junior LP from Oasis.  As much as I love Oasis, as much as I wanted Be Here Now to be as good if not better than their first two albums, I'll be the first to criticize England's greatest 90's alt band for the mass inconsistency here.  Indeed, Be Here Now seems thrown together for the sake of pleasing a salivating British public, who, like me, wanted more Morning Glory?.  Instead, we received a really fascinating mix of some quality tracks and absolute garbage, throw-away, Morning Glory? B-sides.  On the bright side, the arrogant yet infatuating `D'You No What I Mean' and the `Hey Jude' imitator and AT&T's favorite `All Around the World' rank among the best songs of Oasis career.  We also have `My Big Mouth,' a splendid hard-rocker, and the big time `Don't Go Away,' a dazzling ballad that's right there with `Cast No Shadow' and `Don't Look Back in Anger.'  These four tracks alone morph Be Here Now from a collection of hyped filler into a worthy listen, but there's very little after the latter.  `It's Getting Better (Man!!)' and `I Hope, I Think, I Know' are okay, but the likes of `Magic Pie, Fade In-Out,' and the title track all need to burn in hell for their sins against quality Oasis.  I agree with whoever first said that if Oasis had thrown `Acquiesce' and `Fade Away' from The Masterplan on this A-side release and likewise shave of the worthless filler, Be Here Now would be as much of a classic as its predecessors.  Not even on the same level as Definitely Maybe or (WTS) MG?, but enough value for 3.5 stars all the same.  Not bad for arguably their weakest release to date.
B000050HTO|5.0|Why do I see like 10 reviews, all saying things like \\"Bob Dylan sux\\" (and usually with bad grammar and sentence structure)? Ok, so you think he \\"sux\\". Why? Most of these reviews say nothing as to why the person dislikes him. When I read a review, I like to see negative reviews that say, for example, \\"I don't like ... because of ... and ...\\", because it can help me decide on wether to buy the disc or not if I've never heard the artist before. <br /> <br />But besides that, this is a good beginner compilation. Songs like \\"All Along the Watchtower\\", \\"It's all Over Now, Baby Blue\\" and \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" appear so people can hear what first enticed some great and influential musicians to cover them. Classics like \\"Hurricane\\", \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" are the essential Dylan hits one would expect. <br /> <br />Personally, I do think there are a few great songs that perhaps could've replaced some tracks on this collection. A weak song like \\"I'll Be Your Baby Tonight\\" could've been replaced by something like \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\" which (IMO) is a great and underplayed Dylan Song.
B000CBSHK2|1.0|I was looking forward to purchasing another Beth Orton album. Central Reservation and Pass In Time are marvelous. Imagine my dismay when I popped the CD into my lovely two-channel high end system to hear what amounts to MP3 quality sound. Simply awful. Move the production back to England. The people in New York obviously don't know what they're doing.
0887307280|3.0|When I started reading this book, I was intrigued about the \\"three personalities\\" asserted by Mr. Gerber and how the forces of the Technician, Manager and Entrepreneur must exist in balance for a business to succeed. As I read on, I was looking forward to this \\"Entrepreneurial Model\\" as I thought it would assist me in the formation of my software company. I was very disappointed that this model only deals with franchising. The author seems to be making the assumption that the franchise is the only system-driven business that can ensure success, as if it was the best thing since sliced bread. I agree in the importance of developing business systems, but the franchise is only one type of system that may not lend itself well to other strategies (such as developing a software product). I am developing systems to ensure that the business runs smoothly (and without me being involved in every single process), but I have no intention of making a software company that I can sell to \\"franchisees\\" like a Big Mac or a pie (a pie business is used as an example throughout the book). My company will sell eventually, but getting bought out seems different than franchising. <br /> <br />In summary, I was very disappointed as I thought that this book would address start-up companies in general and about building business systems, regardless if you are selling pies, hamburgers, or technology. Instead, the author takes a narrow approach by only focusing on the franchise business model. The point of the book (your business is not your life, being able to establish a business as a set of systems) can be applied to (and expressed in) more than just franchises.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|I love Mark.  I've never really heard of Emmy.  This album is getting better and better every time I listen.  These kind of works of art are really the best.  The first time I heard Dark Side, I was not blown away.
B000DZIGDU|2.0|Here, in Jarhead, director Sam Mendes has a chance to build on some of the hate and distrust for the Marine Corps which he constructed previously in his overrated blockbuster American Beauty. It's not a pretty sight, and one would think, based on the psychological instability prevalent within Swoff's platoon, that these soldiers had spent four years fighting on the Eastern front instead of four days in the Middle East during Desert Storm. That these fellows underwent the type of ungluing they did, based on such a short period in action, is incredibly unlikely, and, to do so in such a uniform fashion, defies belief. When contemplating the madness of these characters, the fact that they all graduated from high school, let alone avoided placement in a special education program for the emotionally disturbed, is astonishing. Overall, I completely doubted the veracity of this story.<br /><br />The attempt to portray the entire company as a group of blood-thirsty zealots, who whoop and holler as a village gets destroyed in Apocalypse Now, was actually quite offensive. I really think that these negative stereotypes are put forth as a means to defile the USMC, who stand guard over our safety regardless of the way in which Hollywood demeans them. A good bit of propaganda is also included in the allusion to the fact that everything done in Iraq was due to our lust for oil. This is patently ridiculous. Our government is the richest entity on this earth and they're not concerned about how much their citizens pay for gasoline. They could care less, yet this was just another way to delegitimize the presence of the Marines on the peninsula which was probably the purpose for making the movie in the first place.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|If Californication was a clue, then By The Way was clear evidence that RHCP were going to follow up those two albums with something like this.  While I appreciate the early material for its groundbreaking value, Stadium Arcadium seems like a natural culmination that finds the Peppers standing with other great bands that have gone through sometimes inexplicable transitions to unexpectedly arrive at the peak of their success. One can argue the strength of this or that song, but it's a solid piece of work overall, blended nicely and never boring.
0393317552|5.0|The book Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond says that the earth has four factors to the development of history its self 1. Availability of potential crops and domestic animals 2. The areas of which geographic terms apply to the spread of agriculture, 3) transfer of knowledge between continents and 4.Population size. Jared brings up strong arguments in each of these topics making it really hard to come back at him with ideas that topple his own. I for one am fascinated by the amount of work he put in to his research in to findings. Though when reading the book I saw that he often \\"if\\" or \\"could occur\\" that things were the way he thought. In other words he wasn't always sure of the findings that he found. When he started to talk about domestication early in the book he explained that in about the early 1400s domestication didn't start and wild animals and plants continued to grow. Until the 1800 when Europe and Asia stated to control them and start harvesting them to there use. It started from plants to animals to production. Animals such as ox and horses were used to help harvest and work on the fields to do jobs that would take weeks of doing. As that went on People started to plant the seeds of the plants to harvest them as they became more and more easy to grow, but grain was mostly the thing that was commonly made because in Europe it was mostly hot with cold nights which made a nice home to grains. When that happened everyone started to use that method so that the amount of food that they needed was there. <br /> Agriculture has start for quiet some time now but because of the temperatures and each condition that each plant needs not all areas of the earth are able to give enough of the needs that one plant needs making agriculture fail or not succeed in some areas. Though if agriculture did not prosper at the time or place, other activities were made. When Spain had come over to the southern part of Mexico they only knew about power greed and wealth unlikethe Aztecs that already lived there. When the time of departure came, the Spaniards had carried with them not only new things to the new land but also disease and killings.  <br />With know guns germs and steel being passed around for conquering Jared Diamond switches his topic over to transferring knowledge between countries. Know China ideas of writing were passed on all over the world being more and more diverse as it does. The way of writing originated in China and which is know known as the \\"Writers Country\\" to some people. Japan and Korea are some places that copy the same technique in writing but when it moved more west it turned in to more simple and bold writing (To Westerners).Writing wasn't the only one to be born and changed around the world. Germs have been passed from end of the earth to the other from transportation to contamination. Even though some medicines have been made from herbs and other things the amount of changes that occur in the viruses change rapidly, but people such as the New Guinea. New Guanines have various cures for some things that we have here only at a workable price.   Knowledge of history and even great teachings of wise people that are portrayed like that in some countries. Religions is also moving around the globe even today more and more religions are slowly progressing each which there own beliefs or feelings. <br />As food progresses so does the population. If the amount of food rises and is able to fully support its consumers then there is a likely chance for it to expand in population. Also if the population expands more and more resources are used to complete the needs of the villagers.Poplulation can only grow till the carrying capacity of one are is filled and cause emigration to occur. When this happens more immigration would occur leading to different people coming and leaving. Over all this book has taught me a lot about history and how things work from its ancestors. <br />
B000DN5W4I|4.0|If you found this page then you aready know who Joe Bonamassa is.  The band's performance is awesome.  The camera work is great and keeps you in touch with all 3 members plus the audience.  The set list is very enjoyable.    But what is up with the sound?  This is a CONCERT DVD.  We buy these for the sound as much as the visuals, and this one has sub-par sound.  As someone else mentioned there is only one sound stream (stereo), despite a link in the menu that promises DTS surround sound.  That in itself is no big deal.  I'd take great PCM stereo over compressed surround sound any day, but this is NOT great PCM stereo.  It's overdriven and clipped AC3.  I've purchased other DVDs that exhibit similar problems (Allman Bros Beacon Theater comes to mind) and I just don't get it.  Given the storage capacity of DVDs, it's simply inexcusable.    Bottom line: It's Joe, so buy the DVD.  But like me, you may lament what should have been.    Edit: Actually I do get it.  It's a Rockpalast recording and they typically have minor audio issues.  Maybe they engineer these on the fly for live broadcast, or maybe they record them, but don't take the time to master them to their highest potential.  In any case, the show is great, the band is on fire, and the setting looks pretty cool.  After dozens of listens, I no longer whine about the sound.  It's a great portrait of the original line-up and I am greatful Joe was able to release this show.  Buy it!
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I rate the movie 5 stars, both the 1977 version and the special edition. And I say to all of you who love to complain and call George Lucas names, that you're lucky he's releasing the unaltered versions at all. I wouldn't. If you don't like the fact that they're not enhanced by 16x9 TVs, don't buy them. I'm not, because I already have the boxed set that came out in 2004 and that's all I need. I don't think Lucas needs any more money, because he's loaded. I think he was just trying to do the people who wanted the original versions so bad a favor. But it looks like he just gave certain people something else to complain about.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I just bought this DVD because of the excellent reviews I saw here.   <br />Now that I am done with S1 after a couple of weeks of almost nonstop viewing, I just have a feeling of frustration when I read over various forums that it is unlikely that Warner will release the rest of the seasons because of low sales of this one. <br />This is hands down one of the best shows I have seen in the past ten years. Vancamp is terrific, Smith is a total discovery, the dialogues are just brilliant.....It is difficult to beat a package like this. <br />And yet we have to sadly see how the only series that seem to do well in sales are the CSI's and the like. <br />Something is very wrong in today's audiences.......... <br /> <br /> <br />
006056251X|5.0|I have been waiting for this book since the last when Evie approached Sebastian St. Vincent(who was a bag of bruises)to marry her! <br /> <br />What a cliffhanger and it did not disappoint.  One thing I like about Lisa Kleypas' books is that you find yourself smiling when you read them.  The repartee is delicious.  Sebastian's comments are hysterical if droll.  What a nice story and everyone loves a lover!  Sexuality is a 8.  The characters from the other Wallflowers books appear in this book much to everyone's enjoyment.   <br /> <br />A wonderful poolside book. A feel good story with a happy ending.  The journey is the best!!!!!
B000F1IQN2|1.0|How can this film--about an important and complex subject--be so bad--and especially so--since the great Steven Speilberg directed it.  It is shallow in character develoment--very important to understand ther psychology of BOTH sides.  And dully photographed.  Not one really good shot.  I waited to see this on video, thinking it would be really good.  I just can't believe it. Worse than Da Vinci Code.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|To market these as being able to get the originals, when the real deal is georgie boy is just trying to make more money off his \\"special edition\\".  This extra disc with the original in crappy format is the bait.  Don't take it.  Lucas films  has never released bonus material as these are being labeled in Non-animorphic format.  If you own the laserdisc this will be no better as that is where this is being sourced.  This yeilds about 30% less resolution then an animorphic (or enhanced for 16x9) transfer would and will look like bad in comparison even on a 4:3 TV.  These aren't the discs your looking for.  Move along.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|There are times in life when you waste time and it feels great doing it! You sit under a tree for two hours... you play videogames all day... I personally like to sit on the edge of my bed for many minutes right when I wake up. <br /> <br />But then there are other times when you waste time and it just eats at your conscience! Like when you go to graduations and sit there for 3 hours just to see ONE person cross the stage... or when you are forced to go to a dumb birthday party when you have a million other things you need to do... or when you watch Hostel... <br /> <br />This movie made me feel extremely guilty watching it. I coulda been working on world peace or something, but instead I watched a stupid movie that 1) Wasn't even scary 2) Wasn't even thrilling 3) They couldn't cast better looking chicks? <br /> <br />After all the hype, I was surprised to see that it wasn't even as gory as I thought is was gonna be. Why are you gonna make a big deal about all the torture if most of it happens off the view of the camera? Over-hyped!!! Sure her eyeball's hangin out, but we didn't actually see it happen. That dude's fat back was in the way. <br /> <br />I don't know, maybe I'm the only dude in this world that was born without the chip that was supposed to tell me this movie was cool. Skip it...
B000EULJLU|5.0|I never peticularly liked Tool until I hear Lateralus. Lateralus blew me away, totally changed my relationship to music and in some ways to life in general. I then rediscovered their earlier albums and grew to love them too. Tool, like few other bands shows clear signs of progression on every album. Most people seem to regard Aenema as the best album and Lateralus as second best. This is hard for me to understand. Most people want tool to be that angrier band and yet do not appreciate as much the resolution and spiritual awakening that all hardships in life hopefully bring us too. 10,000 days brings together both worlds. Like \\"The 13th step\\"(Maynards latest album with A perfect Circle) this album is very emotional. It is also prickly like Aenema. Issues just seem never to go away. While I don't like it as much as Lateralus, this is still one of the greatest albums in the last decade or two. Wings for Mary and 10,000 days are probably my favorate. Here Maynard seems to resolve his issues with his mother and sees the true beauty of her Christian Faith although he detest the Church. This album definetely carries a unique identity, one which I am still trying to figure out.
B000001FDK|5.0|This cd is awsome, but I don't care for the songs that at played a the prom. My favorite songs are the orignal cast songs!
0385507755|1.0|I had heard much of the controversy about Frey's making up all sorts of information for this book--lies about prior arrests, jail time, his broken childhood.  In reading the book, I found virtually all of his experience in alcohol/drug treatment to be fictional (he, of course, won't release the info from Hazelden).  I attended treatment a long time ago, and I can assure folks--this is simply not the way it happens.  It's not only fiction, it's implausible.
0446613444|4.0|Michael Connelly's book \\"Black Ice\\" (the 2nd book he wrote) takes us back to Harry Bosch and his investigation of a suicide of a police officer. Bosch gets involved in the case since his supervisor knows Bosch can solve cases and the department needs to get some cases closed to make the politicians look good. <br /> <br />The plot gets more involved as Bosch finds himself dealing with Mexican authorities and the drug cartel in Mexico. It's a good read from one of the best mystery writers around these days. Not to \\"spoil\\" anyone's reading of the numerous books written by Connelly, but this book (Black Ice) and his latest book (The Lincoln Lawyer) have a connection which will surprise you. <br /> <br />If you haven't read anything by Michael Connelly it is time to do so!
B00005JO20|5.0|This movie was actually good. I though it was going to be boring, but I liked it.. I considered it a love story......the ape and ann the way they connected with each other, with words, just security and the sun set was amazing....it made me shed a tear. Watch this film
0345440900|5.0|This small book provided me with the most sound advice on surviving my son's first year than any other book I read.  <br /> <br />In particular, Tracy's \\"dreamfeed\\" concept helped him sleep deeper without the need to wake from hunger. My son is now 28 months and sleeps 3.5 hours at nap and 11 hours straight at night. <br /> <br />Tracy's toddler book is also worth the read.
B00006L83N|5.0|Without a doubt, never has a greater rock album been written.  Symphony X is comprised of some of the most talented musicians in the rock genre today.  While many comparisons have been made between Dream Theater and Symphony X, I honestly don't believe that they even come close.  Sym X, although having less techincal proficiency, is more concerned about the musical elements of progressive rock, bringing some of the catchiest lyrics and most intense guitar solos to the playing field.   <br /> <br />Over the past 12 years, Symphony X has evolved immensely.  After the original debut of the self titled \\"Symphony X\\", Rod Tyler left the band, which led to the hiring of Russel Allen, by far the best rock singer of this decade.  With his insane range and instantly provoking lyrics, he really added the majority of what Sym X is today.  Also, with the addition of the relativey new bass player, Michael LePond (hired since Twiligh In Olympus), and some of the old members like Mike Pinella and Jason Rullo, the band's core sound has changed in a good way, to accompany the last and most important member of this incredible group.. Michael Romeo.  Although only ranked 102nd on the greatest rock guitarist, his guitar solos are nothing short of memorable, not to mention his incredible ability to also double as rythym guitar. <br /> <br />Although still filled with some of the cheezy lyrics based off magicians, spells, and other literature, it is obvious that the band is comfortable with their writing, going so far as to name their album off the greatest epic poem of all time, The Odyssey. <br /> <br />My thoughts on each song are as follows: <br /> <br />1. INFERNO (UNLEASH THE FIRE) - 10/10 (Bam, this song attacks the                            listener the second they put the CD in.  It's filled with dramatic suspensions and a crazy fast opening that really tunes you in to the upcoming sound.) <br /> <br />2. WICKED - 8/10 (Unique... mostly filled with rythym guitar, which kind of bores most, but does have an amazing vocal solo at around 4 minutes that shows you Russel's talent.) <br /> <br />3. INCANTATIONS OF THE APPRENTICE - 6/10 (Worst song on the album, but it's ok, because the best is yet to come..) <br /> <br />4. ACCOLADE II - 9/10 (Follow-up to one of the best Sym X songs ever written back on Divine Wings Of Tragedy.  This is the epitome of cheezy lyrics, but eh.. its just sweet.) <br /> <br />5. KING OF TERRORS - 10/10 (It seems as if the fan base for Sym X is either those who like ripping fast songs with burning riffs, or those who like the rock ballads, and although I do consider myself to be the latter, this song just kicks a**, basing its lyrics off Edgar Allen Poe's work.. \\"The Pit And The Pendulum\\") <br /> <br />6. THE TURNING - 8/10 (Most traditional rock song on the album, heavy, and filled with vocal runs.  Begins to die on you after a couple listens though.) <br /> <br />7. AWAKENINGS - 10/10 (Words cannot describe the genius of this song..) <br /> <br />8. THE ODYSSEY - 11/10 (Ok, so most of the time when I read people's reviews of songs that they give 11 or 12 out of tens i laugh and call them stupid because they don't know about music, but cmon this song is just perfect.  It tells the tale of the greatest greek hero ever, littered with guitar solos, bass solos, keyboard solos, and vocals that are just damn cool.  This is by far the greatest rock song ever written and if you don't agree.. go suck it.) <br /> <br />9. MASQUERADE (Bonus Track) - 7/10 (Unoriginal... lyrics are same as original 1994 song.. not fun to listen to.) <br /> <br />10. FRONTIERS (Japense Bonus Track) - 7/10 (Honestly haven't listened to it much, but opening with the lyrics \\"Yeah, Yeah\\".. is just dumb, and not Symphony X.  Glad they didn't put this on the US version.) <br /> <br /> <br />So yeah, I named this review \\"Perfect..\\" and I gave an average song rating of about 8, but remember.. if I reviewed other albums on the same standars of musicality,catchiness, and just plain coolness.. it'd be 0's accross the board. Rock on!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I rented a movie just yesterday, and was just going to leave a review I wrote on the Amazon board, but before I do that, I happened to catch your review, and decided to change my long review into a short input.    Is this a movie for straight men? Absolutely! This movie shows what true love is to human beings, and despite the fact that the women in this movie suffered, the female viewers of this movie are not offended. Most of whom even commented that Jack and Ennis should be together.     If even women aren't offended, why should we men get squimish because of some sex scene between two guys? People who say these scenes are not suitable for straight people are only sounding that they are uncomfortable with their own sexuality. I watched this movie with my wife, and I can assure you that we are both moved by the beauty of this movie.    So...losen up, this is an art, not an action movie.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|first off, knowing this is a cliche, this is my first review. i dont like to rant on the internet because its pointless. this movie has its moments and i really like the title song. clive owen is not a miscast...repeat clive own is not a miscast. he really carries the movie and his scenes are by far the most entertaining. he plays a scum bag doctor and plays it to perfection. really an unbelievable cast and the more i see this movie, the better it gets. and this was a movie i hated after seeing the first time. for a chick-flick, this movie is tolerable for guys because of owen. he is one of the most underrated actors of our time.
B00006RU5B|5.0|One of only a few all time classic albums to come out this century.  If your a fan of rock or looking to expand your musical tastes give it a try.
B000002HGD|5.0|well, the year is 2006, and the album \\"Everything is Wrong\\" came out in '95. How sad (but absolutely amazing) it took me THIS long to actually discover this album and give it a chance.  <br /> <br />Putting all the wonderful songs aside, I would like to mention one song on this album that is absolutely incredibly breath-taking. Its not even breath-taking, you can't even breath to lose your own breath!  <br /> <br />\\"When It's Cold I'd Like To Die\\"  <br /> <br />This piece is just brilliant. I've listened to it non-stop today and probably tomorrow and the next day. Being an artist/actor - I have written a performance art piece to the minute I heard and in hopes of performing it and getting it out there. Its just gorgeous and I don't even think my words can explain it. I come across many songs as so, but I never ever expected this of Moby (not a bad thing) but like everyone else here, I think I can speak for everyone else here, that this really displays Moby as an artist, and an amazing one. <br /> <br />The ending of the song is perfect, as if the song is just a moment in time, an epiphany, and at the end - it just ALL fades away in an echo. Its as if the song will continue in its next life.    <br /> <br />If my piece ever gets performed, i'll be glad to share it with all the fans.
B000062X90|5.0|Stumbled upon this and had an instant flashback. The great twin guitar work, the wonderful cover, and it includes most of the Live promo EP. A must have for rock n roll progressives.
B000002AGB|5.0|The album that changed the course and career of this unbelievable band in their live performances. The only word for this album is only one and non more nor less than: astonishing. <br /> <br />To start, \\"The Who\\", is the best live band that ever stepped into a stage, (then follows Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Bruce Springsteen and we know the whole story) and undisputably, this album is quintessential for building a descent rock collection and part of the three essential live albums from \\"The Who\\". (Live at Leeds, Live at the Isle of Wight and finally Live at the Royal Albert Hall in order of greatness) <br />But maybe this whole order is wrong, of course \\"Leeds\\" is a legendary album, but this is actually similar to \\"Leeds\\".  <br />This album is the same of \\"Leeds\\" in songs: <br />- Heaven and Hell <br />- Can't Explain <br />- Young Man Blues <br />- Summertime Blues <br />- Magic Bus (ending both shows) <br />- My Generation (the \\"Leeds\\" performance is a little bit too long, but more complete, although I prefer this version) <br />- Substitute <br />- Shakin' All Over/Spoonful (Twist & Shout is new in the concert, but the previous medley is included in \\"Leeds\\" plus the whole performance of \\"Tommy\\"!) <br /> <br />This album is barely different to \\"Leeds\\", except obviously for the way they play the songs. For example, they play \\"Heaven and Hell\\", \\"Young Man Blues\\", \\"Sparks\\", \\"Substitute\\" and of course \\"Magic Bus\\" better on the \\"Leeds\\" album. <br />Then the whole \\"Tommy\\" performance is overall similar to \\"Leeds\\" except for the order of some songs. Of course there are also songs on this album that are not including on \\"Leeds\\" and the same with \\"Leeds\\". The best versions on this album rather than \\"Leeds\\" are: \\"Summertime Blues\\", \\"My Generation\\" and songs that are not included in the \\"Leeds\\" album are: \\"I Don't Even Know Myself\\", \\"Water\\", \\"Naked Eye\\" (all three of them are included in the \\"Who's Next\\" album) and the medley of \\"Shakin' All Over/Spoonful/Twist and Shout\\". (though I don't know weather to decide \\"Shakin' All Over Medley\\" is better on \\"Leeds\\" or on this one, because the one from \\"Leeds\\" has an amazing guitar solo, but this doesn't; instead, they play \\"Twist and Shout\\" which is a great surprise. You decide) <br /> <br />Now, if you want me to review each song on this album individually I'll gladly do it: <br /> <br />The Who.- Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 <br /> <br />Disc One.- <br /> <br />1.- Heaven and Hell.- The opening song to this breath-taking concert. Starting at 3:00 AM, the crowd went nuts! There wasn't much spirit on this one like on \\"Leeds\\", but still an amazing performance of this amazing song written by John \\"Thunderfingers\\" Entwistle.  <br /> <br />2.- Can't Explain.- Just like \\"Leeds\\", following \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and exactly the same version, obviously the sound is different but the structure of the song is similar. One of their first singles and one of their best. <br /> <br />3.- Young Man Blues.- An amazing cover by this incredible live band. Again: there is not as much spirit on this song like on \\"Leeds\\", but the song is overall great. This was one of the best songs of its time and \\"The Who\\" revived it more vividly and powerful. <br /> <br />4.- I Don't Even Know Myself.- A very powerful song and which's lyrics and interlude is breath-taking and fun. This song is played with much spirit and probably one of the best live version of this great song. Released for the first time on the \\"B\\"-side of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" single, then added to the \\"Who's Next\\" album, makes this song a classic along with the rest from that same album. <br /> <br />5.- Water.- One of this album's best songs. This song is simply undescribable, for its vocals are so full of energy from Roger Daltrey; which's guitar is so chord-pounding and which's solo is so full of potential; which's bass-pounding sound shakes the whole audience and the band itself; and which's drums, as usual, are so full of potential, power, complexity and irony all-together (classic Keith; RIP). First appeared on the \\"B\\"- side of the \\"5:15\\" single in 1973. Then, included on the \\"Who's Next\\" album. <br /> <br />6.- Overture.- OK. Time for \\"Tommy\\" to heat up the audience and the concert. Everyone love \\"Tommy\\" and this song ain't bad. This song is practically a medley of the songs: \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\", \\"Go To The Mirror\\", \\"See Me, Feel Me\\", \\"Listening to You\\" and finally \\"Pinball Wizard\\", but with no lyrics. (these songs appear later on \\"Tommy's\\" live performance on this album, the \\"Leeds\\" album and of course the studio album. <br /> <br />7.- It's A Boy.- This is where the story really begins and Tommy is born. The song is short, as well as most of the rest from \\"Tommy\\", but when put together, you get an uncanny rock opera. <br /> <br />8.- 1921.- Many would also consider this a short song, but, again, when put together it makes sense. I guess that's why \\"The Who\\" played the complete \\"Tommy\\" on their live perfomances. <br /> <br />9.- Amazing Journey.- \\"Amazing Journey\\", amazing song. When you put this one next to \\"Sparks\\" and you will obtain a saucey rock performance with amazing bass-pounding, gut-busting drums performance, and of course the guitar will not miss out! <br /> <br />10.- Sparks.- I don't need to say anything here. Just listen to the song carefully to apreciate this one. The second instrumental on the \\"Tommy\\" performance. Also catalogued as one of the top 10 rock instrumental. Way to go! <br /> <br />11.- Eyesight to the Blind (The Hawker).- A \\"small\\" song, but nontheless, part of \\"Tommy\\". The bass on this one is amazing! <br />The silent guitar is also great. <br /> <br />12.- Christmas.- A great song, with an appropiate length to listen to it individually. With this song, the first album ends. But will continue. <br /> <br /> <br />OK. We've already studied the first album. Now go get a snack or a drink and I'll wait for you. Really, go.............. <br /> <br />OK! Let's continue! <br /> <br />Disc Two.- <br /> <br />1.- The Acid Queen.- Alright!! \\"Tommy\\" continues! <br />This song, individually almost makes no sense, although it has an appropiate length to listen to it individually. I really advice you listen to this one along with the whole \\"Tommy\\" performance.  <br /> <br />2.- Pinball Wizard.- One of the masterpiece individual songs from \\"Tommy\\". Played very similar comparing to \\"Leeds\\" and the studio album of \\"Tommy\\". This is one of the very few songs from \\"Tommy\\" that makes sense without having to listen the whole album. Also one of \\"The Who's\\" best songs ever written. <br />Listen to version of \\"Elton John's\\", it is amazing and much more vivid than \\"The Who's\\", but that's another subject. <br /> <br />3.- Do You Think It's Alright?.- Nothin' to say here. Doesn't make any sense. Listen to the whole \\"Tommy\\". <br /> <br />4.- Fiddle About.- Yeah, listen to the whole \\"Tommy\\" to understand this one as well. <br /> <br />5.- Tommy Can You Hear Me?.- Same here !!!!! <br /> <br />6.- There's a Doctor.- Although nice little song... doesn't make any sense unless you listen to the whole \\"Tommy\\". <br /> <br />7.- Go To The Mirror!- Finally!!! A song that makes perfect sense when listened individually and something to talk about. This song's riff is really cool. Also one of the best riffs in rock history. The lyrics are also really great. To fully experience it, listen to this one along with \\"Smash The Mirror\\". <br /> <br />8.- Smash The Mirror.- Great drumming on the beginning of this one. The background vocals are really great and the guitar work is unbelivable. You can also listen to this one individually, but it's not THAT complete. Although, fantastic song! <br /> <br />9.- Miracule Cure.- Many people consider this one a joke, because... I mean.... it is 14 seconds long !! <br />But everything is part of the show !!! Remember to listen to the whole \\"Tommy\\" to appreciate this song a little more. <br /> <br />10.- I'm Free.- Another song that canbe listened individually and makes perfect sense. This song is another one that is amazing and a classic on \\"Tommy\\", along with \\"Pinball Wizard\\". <br />The guitar riff is also a highlight to this fantastic song! <br /> <br />11.- Tommy's Holiday Camp.- Funny song, although a kind of short, is the only one that was written by genious drummer Keith Moon (RIP). One of the funniest songs on the album; both \\"Tommy\\" and this one. <br /> <br />12.- We're Not Gonna Take It.- Probably the best individual songs of \\"Tommy\\" it is kind of long, but necessary. This song has an amazing riff, both from guitar and bass guitar. The vocals and lyrics are breath-taking. This is one of the best songs performed on this live album! Explosive! Amazing! Probably the best song from \\"Tommy\\" and with this one, the live \\"Tommy\\" masterpiece ends; but the concert doesn't!!! There is still a few more to check out, and probably the following songs \\"make\\" this album what it really is! <br /> <br />13.- Summertime Blues.- Originally performed by Eddie Cochran in the 50s, though the original version of the song from Cochran is more of a country than a rock 'n' roll song, \\"The Who\\" made this song \\"their song\\" by adding a more precise riff, and one of the best guitar riffs in history of rock 'n' roll! They also added a stunning guitar solo, short but powerful. This song is more known to be played by \\"The Who\\" rather than Eddie Cochran, and they deserve it! They took a song that was in \\"coma\\" and revived it, charged it, boosted it and the result is this masterpiece!!  <br />LONG LIVE WHO!!! <br /> <br />14.- Shakin' All Over/Spoonful/Twist and Shout.- Simply amazing! <br />This medley makes the concert what it is !!!!!!!!! <br />The original song is \\"Shakin' All Over/Spoonful\\", but the crowd wouldn't expect a song written by one of the best bands of the history of rock, (although I insist that \\"The Who\\" is much better than \\"The Beatles\\", right?) the surprise caused an impact on the audience at 4:00 AM with the crowd jumping around and rocking like they never have! And who wouldn't? <br /> <br />15.-Subsitute.- Many say that his one is \\"The Who's\\" best single of their entire career as genious musicians. This song was written by Pete Townshend (guitarist) like most of \\"The Who\\" songs. They considered themselves a \\"substitute\\" for the \\"Rolling Stones\\", that's how the song was born. This is one of the funniest \\"Who\\" songs ever! Although if you listen to a certain point on the song, Roger Daltrey kind of mistakes with the lyrics and makes up a verse of the song. Then a few seconds later he stops singing and then sings again. That didn't stop the crow in jumping and rocking! This, for me, is one of the best versions of this incredible song! <br /> <br />16.- My Generation.- The show just keeps getting better and better and hotter and hotter!!! This song was requested since the beginning of the show. (on disc 1). Finally they play this one. For those who don't know this is the best rock anthem in the history of rock !!!! Typical 60s rock 'n' roll song.  <br />This song made the audience even crazier and more excited. They only expected more and more from these rockers!!!!! <br /> <br />17.- Naked Eye.- OK. \\"The Who\\",here, in order to build more excitement to the show, they play a new song at that time; \\"Naked Eye\\". Appeard for the first time on the \\"Odds and Sodds\\" album in 1974 and the was released on the \\"Who's Next\\" album. This song starts off slow and then mind-blowing the audience's heads into a violent rock 'n' roll movement. When this song was over, the audienced became totally crazy!!!!They only expected the show to get better!!!  <br /> <br />18.- Magic Bus.- .... And it did!! When \\"Magic Bus\\" started, the audienced were barely able to move; they were stunned!! <br />An amazing classic from this amazing band was played after a mind-blowing song. The crowd had nothing to do here but to rock 'n' roll all night (in the words of \\"Kiss\\").  <br />The audience didn't want the show to be over, but unfortunatley, it had to. <br /> <br />The show has ended at 5:00 AM! And the audience still wanting more from \\"The Who\\". They were satisfied, but they wanted to be really really \\"full\\" !!!!! <br />Unfortunatley the show had to end. <br /> <br />Now see here; the moral of all this show is to demonstrate what an amazing band \\"The Who\\" was and still is! Probably MY all-time favorite band, because they know how to satisfy an audience and listeners and followers of their music.  <br />\\"The Who\\" is a perfect example of a rock band that has influenced the rock bands we hear today! And this album is a witness to the miracles they've done. In order to experience a full \\"Who\\" miracle-work, but this album along with \\"Leeds (Deluxe)\\" and \\"The Royal Albert Hall Concert\\", because these three albums will be the testament of \\"The Who\\", not only a testament, but a proof of their existance, no one will ever forget them.... <br /> <br />\\"Ladies and Gentlemen, a nice little group from Shepherd's Bush, London, here's \\"The Who\\" !!!!!!!
1594200823|5.0|I bought this book after reading an interview with Pollan in \\"The Sun\\" magazine.  He's an excellent writer and speaker (he lectures widely, including at events like \\"The Bioneers\\" conference), and does a good job of describing how we can change the world by changing our eating habits.  Corporate chieftains fear how organic vegetables and the slow food movement threaten to trim a couple percentage points off of their profit margins.  No doubt agribusiness and big oil will be working to impose their model on other nations - like Iraq, where a former executive of Cargill was appointed to Iraq's Ministry of Agriculture (see \\"The Bush Agenda: Invading the World, One Economy at a Time\\" by Antonia Juhasz).   This movement against industrial agriculture is world-wide.  Indian author Vandana Shiva has studied and battled agri-cartels for decades, and the manner in which they destroy the more appropriate modes of farming practiced by many small farmers throughout the world (see Shiva's \\"Monoculture of the Mind\\").  Pollan has valid criticisms of the \\"big organic\\" stores like Whole Foods and Wild Oats, but they are a vast improvement over the omnipresent McDonalds and KFCs.    In addition to Pollan's efforts, Eric Schloser's \\"Fast Food Nation\\" and documentaries like \\"Super Size Me\\" and \\"The Future of Food\\" have already resulted in healthier food choices for hundreds of thousands of people, and school districts across the country are being pressed to offer young people real food.  Purchasing \\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\" not only provides an excellent read, but also the info to empower us to become advocates for healthier living, and a less toxic planet.      \\"On the other side, you have the 'slow-food' movement, which wants to bring back cultural traditions regarding food, to promote agricultural biodiversity, and to show that food can be indulged in safely.  It's not a scolding movement; it's based around pleasure and recognizes that at some point taste has to come into this.  If you can educate people's palates, they will find a cheeseburger from McDonald's incredibly diappointing.\\" -Michael Pollan, \\"The Sun\\" May 2006
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Thank you SquareEnix for giving us Final Fantasy VII fans something like Advent Children at last. Especially after the disappointment that was The Spirits Within, Advent Children is not only a refreshing nostalgic experience for any fan of Final Fantasy VII, but a visual representation of, in my opinion, the deepest and most memorable videogame I have ever played. At its core, VII was a love story between Cloud and Aerith, but it goes way beyond that to Cloud's painful memories and let's not forget saving the world and that whole Jenova thingy. Most \\"hardcore\\" fans who'd been playing Final Fantasy since the original were turned off by VII's new direction. It's was completely different from what they were used to and who can blame them? It traded old school dungeons for smoky industrial cities and the slums of Midgar. Square took a huge leap onto the Playstation platform with VII (they had been pretty much Nintendo exclusive up to that point). It started the whole CG cutscene trend in RPGs and made it cool to know how to breed a gold chocobo and where the Knights of the Round materia was. Final Fantasy VII was a turning point for the RPG, especially in America. Most younger gamers will tell you VII was their first RPG and it's what got them into the genre. It justs goes to show how much of an influence the game really had. The movie is definitely directed towards the fans. I imagine it'd be hard for anyone who has never played through VII to understand what was going on, but that's not to say newbies won't enjoy it. The CG is simply amazing. I've never seen anything quite like it. Square has always had incredible cinematics, and graphics junkies will drool over this one. Little bits of fan service are littered throughout the movie. For example, in one scene Cloud in driving his motorcycle down the road and he passes a sign that reads \\"Healin Lodge.\\" I had to laugh at that.  <br /> <br />The  ending of Final Fantasy VII was quite a cliffhanger. You don't know whetherour heroes make it out alive or if the whole world is destroyed. It left many questions unanswered and that's where Advent Children picks up: two years later. I'm sure everyone's heard about the plot and I'm not going to ruin anything, but it definitely does the fans some service! There is a point where a Bahumut is summoned and all the old characters come together to fight it. A little girl (I think it's Marlene) asks \\"Who are they?\\" and Tifa says \\"Just some old friends.\\" I couldn't help but smile watching that. Don't be turned off by the delay or the fact that Spirits Within was a pretty bad movie, you really should see Advent Children. When I was watching it, I felt myself wanting to play through VII again (and I've already played through it three times!) One of the things I liked best about Advent Children is it shows us Cloud's true feelings about Aerith and how he feels that he let her die. He also has many doubts about himself and he's afraid of being alone. He can't deal with trying to save people and not being able to help them. With the game, it was hard to show all these emotions through plain dialogue, but the movie really does the game some justice. <br /> <br />Has anyone heard about the SquareEnix remaking VII for the PS3? There was a tech demo at E3 and I think this movie was supposed to get us pumped up for that. I'm willing to play through a fourth time!

B000F0UV0E|5.0|\\"If this is goodby\\" inspired by the cell phone calls from the world trade center on the 11th of September, will break your heart.

0517543052|5.0|Goodbye Dr. Richard Alpert, Harvard Psychology professor. Hello Baba Ram Dass, Hindu spiritual seeker and devotee of the great monkey-God Hanuman!<br /><br />'Be Here Now' was a phenomenon born out of the sixties counter culture movement and became \\"the book\\" that turned the spiritual consciousness of the Christian West eastwards, thus altering the metaphysical landscape forever. Not only were the ideas within this 416 page softcover book made of recycled materials a shock to the religious nervous system of the American mainstream, but the very format was a mystery all its own. Part autobiography, part Occidental psychology, part hippie philosophy, part Indian mysticism, part comic book, one was left to wonder if the text was meant to be read in the conventional manner, or somehow absorbed by simply chanting the contents out loud.<br /><br />Truly a piece of 20th century American spiritual history that should be experienced by all. PARADIGM SHIFT ANYONE?
B00008WT5J|5.0|THIS ALBUM KICKS A*S, if you can't handle Angus Young in your face with amazing guitar solos then your p*ssy a*s needs too find music like Garth Brooks S*IT!!
B000EMGAOY|4.0|First, I am a fan of the \\"new\\" older Chili Peppers, and think their last few albums have been great complete albums, which is a rarity by itself anymore.  The fact you can get a DOUBLE album for the price of one makes this the best deal out there right now.   <br /> <br />And I'm not saying this entire thing is classic, there is plenty of filler, but I have compiled my own personal Stadium Arcadium compendium (ahem), picking my faves and creating one very strong single album: <br /> <br />1.    Dani California <br />2.    C'mon Girl <br />3.    Tell Me Baby <br />4.    Charlie <br />5.    Make You Feel Better <br />6.    Snow ((Hey Oh)) <br />7.    Hard to Concentrate <br />8.    Slow Cheetah <br />9.    Especially In Michigan <br />10.  21st Century <br />11.  Wet Sand <br />12.  Desecration Smile <br /> <br />So that's what I think, you could easily listen to these songs straight through and start it over again.  You may not agree, I am def a fan of their more chill harmonizing and catchy guitar stuff, but I would also love to see other peoples' \\"greatest hits\\" of this album.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|If your a classic rock fan then get your a*s up off the couch and buy this d*mn album its one of the essentials and if you don't no rocker will ever take you seriously so stop being a p*ssy and buy this album no questions asked. AC/DC is one of the greatest bands ever literally now buy it the rifts on this album kick a*s!! For only $10 you can own one of the greatest rock 'n' roll cds ever made now buy. If you like AC/DC other bands that I would recomend are Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, H.I.M., Judas Priest, and Motorhead.
0393307050|2.0|I have the unabridged audio edition of Master and Commander.  Three hours into the audio version, NOTHING has happened.  No conflict.  No plot.  There is a lot of nattering on about ship budgets, hiring crew members, and the finer points of music and dining in 17th century Mallorca.  But in all that time, the ship hasn't even left the dock.<br /><br />I gave up expecting anything to happen.  I might have kept reading if the characters were remotely interesting--after all, I enjoyed Lord of the Rings, I love Stephen King and Tad Williams--but these characters are as dull and dry as their powdered wigs.

B000E97HIA|5.0|To me as a Prince fan of twenty years I was glad to see in Rolling Stone that '3121' got to Number 1-it's been awhile.But Prince's latest CD's since his post TAFKAP days have been a bit of a mixed bag.So I got this for my birthday and just slapped and on and BOY I must say I am impressed.But you have to put this CD on good stereo headphones-it burns.My opinion?Prince still has the nack for genre bending.And yes-'3121' has certain elements of his 80's sound,namely the synthisized hooks and the heavy pop hooks.But Prince has changed his mind about the musical styles he uses for the now patened 'Prince' sound (he really just deserves a genre of his now)-classic funk is still the base but the rock blends in more and the jazz and new Brazillian elements are actually put into play,and (thankfully) the hip hop stuff is dead.As always variety continues to be the spice of Prince.The title song is very deep,bassy and mysterious but \\"Lolita\\" burns with a harder,sexier funk and has a great tune attached to it.\\"Te Amo Corazon\\" is lovely,gentle latin pop jazz and very sudtle.\\"Black Sweat\\" is the big hit-it's a fairly contemporary variation of the 1986 era Prince sound that produced \\"Kiss\\" and \\"Girls And Boys\\" but is much darkly sexier in tone.\\"Incence and Candles\\" as well as the more uptempo \\"Love\\" and \\"The Word\\" take a more contemporary taste on funk but it's no in Prince's orbit it's barely noticable.\\"Satisfied\\" is terrific-one of Prince most passionate forays into classic 60's soul with some great belting and Hammond Organ and very cleverly written.\\"Fury\\" is the one tune that harkens all the way back to 80's Prince music with it's funk-rock pop mixture.The final three songs here are actually some of the best here-\\"Beautiful,Loved And Blessed\\" is very bouncy and hummable-Tamar takes lead and raps (a little) and does a good job.\\"The Dance\\" has a latin feel too but tries at a type of music Prince hasn't really done before-the kind of Brazillian funk-jazz fusion Sheila E,George Duke.Airto and Flora Purim were doing in the 70's.\\"Get On The Boat\\" is a terrific way to cap off-Maceo rips a solo through a cut totally worthy of James Brown-Prince himself even takes some grace notes from The Godfather himself.After all these years of hits and misses Prince is still THE MAN when it comes to his craft and at the very least '3121' finds him at the top of his game.I do not know if it is marriage or his new religion that have inspired him and besides these could all be songs that existed in his vaults since the 80's.But not likely-Prince is someone who seems to revell in letting the public here his latest material rather then relaying on his legendary vaults,which he only did briefly in the late 90's during his post Warner Brothers slump.'3121' merges the old with the new-it reaches out to young listeners with it's bassy sonics,dancibility and use of technology as well as reaching out to more (shall I say) adult contemporary listeners looking to hear music from someone they grew up with-hard to believe Prince is lumped in with that age group now.And for those who just want to get funky?This like ANY Prince album is just the ticket.But it more then lives up to the hype and if he keeps moving on from this direction this could be the beginning of a new commercial comeback for his music.Duke.Airto and Flora Purim were doing in the 70's.\\"Get On The Boat\\" is a terrific way to cap off-Maceo rips a solo through a cut totally worthy of James Brown-Prince himself even takes some grace notes from The Godfather himself.After all these years of hits and misses Prince is still THE MAN when it comes to his craft and at the very least '3121' finds him at the top of his game.I do not know if it is marriage or his new religion that have inspired him and besides these could all be songs that existed in his vaults since the 80's.But not likely-Prince is someone who seems to revell in letting the public here his latest material rather then relaying on his legendary vaults,which he only did briefly in the late 90's during his post Warner Brothers slump.'3121' merges the old with the new-it reaches out to young listeners with it's bassy sonics,dancibility and use of technology as well as reaching out to more (shall I say) adult contemporary listeners looking to hear music from someone they grew up with-hard to believe Prince is lumped in with that age group now.And for those who just want to get funky?This like ANY Prince album is just the ticket.But it more then lives up to the hype and if he keeps moving on from this direction this could be the beginning of a new commercial comeback for his music.

B000089RVX|5.0|I've been meaning to get around to writing a review for my favorite CD of all time. Fallen. From the moment I heard Amy Lee's angelic voice, backed by the hard rock sound of the band, I was in love.<br /><br />As soon as you pop in the CD, you'll hear Amy Lee sing \\"Going Under\\". The lyrics of this song are something that anyone who has been in an abusive relationship could relate to.<br /><br />As the next song starts to play, you'll be hearing one of Evanescence's most played songs, \\"Bring Me to Life\\". It was the first single off Fallen. Amy draws you in on this song with her enchanting voice.<br /><br />Angried by the fact that Amy's younger sister was buying into fake pop idols, such as Britney Spears, inspired \\"Everybody's Fool\\". The video for this song consists Amy playing a girl who sells 'Lie' products. At the end, she breaks down and yells at a billboard with her face. Powerful song, powerful video.<br /><br />The next song is perhaps Evanescence's biggest hit on the Fallen album. \\"My Immortal\\"'s lyrics go straight to the heart. The only word to describe this song is 'beautiful', in every way.<br /><br />The next song on the list is \\"Haunted\\". The ghostly sound of this song is catchy, and somewhat more serious than other songs on the CD, with the exception of the next one.<br /><br />'I tried to kill my pain, but only brought more (so much more)' breaks you into this song, \\"Torniquet\\", flawlessly. Suicide is a serious subject, but in this song, Amy is basically questioning a biblical belief. She is asking that if all sins are forgiven, why isn't suicide? Besides the serious undertone of the song, it's quite catchy and emotional.<br /><br />\\"Imaginary\\" brings you into a world of metaphors and mystic subjects. It's a nicely arranged song that'll having you singing along with it soon after you hear it.<br /><br />Have you ever had someone you just can't stop thinking about, such as an ex? \\"Taking Over Me\\" mirrors such a subject with it's lyrics. Amy's powerful voice belts out the chorus with ease.<br /><br />\\"Hello\\", a song very personal to Amy, is about how a child deals with death at such a young age. This enchanting ballad is haunting in how simplistic it is.

0670034711|5.0|I truly loved this book.  The other reviewers have described it better than I can.  I had never heard of Eat Pray Love until a new co-worker, 20 years my junior, handed me a copy.  Said it reminded her of me.  With some skepticism, I checked it out.  What a delightful surprise--I set down everything else I'd been reading and became totally immersed in her fascinating journey, in the whole concept of meditation and stillness and how hard it is for us westerners to stop the monkey mind, in her courage to do this thing alone, privileged or no, and to gut out the rough patches, and anticipated with great pleasure each subsequent reading.  One thing that struck me about the author--I see her picture on the back flap and see a pretty, delicate, blond thing.  I've heard her read from this book and she has a very sweet, feminine voice.  In reading the book, though, I found it somehow strangely reassuring that this woman whom I would never expect to have anything in common with is very real, very human, even funky.  Her sojourn with her friend Yudhi, the Indonesian-born 'New Yorker', and their habit of calling each other \\"dude\\".  As in, \\"Dude, this candy tastes like ASS, man.\\"  And her decision to go off on her long-planned trip with him even though she'd just fallen in love, and her fully enjoying it instead of pining over her new love the whole time.  Her verbal repartee with her Texan friend Richard at the ashram.  Her standing up to Wayan when she got it that she was being taken advantage of.  This girl is no shrinking violet.  She can get down.  And she can take care of herself.  I look forward to reading more by this writer.  I closed the book thinking \\"I love Liz Gilbert.\\"
0790729393|4.0|The members of an all-star cast in Sleepers give an excellent performance in this disturbing film about the lives of four men adversely affected by the horrors of their childhood. Some have said the story is true, some say it is not. Whether or not the incidents portrayed in the film actually took place doesn't take away from their power on the big screen. The four friends take charge as adults to exact vengeance on those guilty of their abuse as youths. That empowerment, even if the film is not based on an actual event, is a strengthening and vindicating shout for viewers who have found themselves in the place of those four boys. And for viewers who have never been in those unfortunate situations, the film creates enough reality to draw empathetic support from this audience. Sleepers is an important film and a well-produced one. The writing, editing, acting and directing are top-notch. Any viewer's attention will remain fixed throughout the movie.
B000BISBDY|5.0|First off, let me start off by saying that I am not a country music person whatsoever. And for the longest time, I thought that Johnny Cash was just another country musician. That all changed Christmas Day of 2005 when I was over my dad's friend's house playing Rummy with the gang, his friend put in his Legend of Johnny Cash CD, and the more I listened to the music, the more blown away I was. From the opening lines of \\"Cry, Cry, Cry\\" all the way to the closing lines of \\"Hurt\\", every song has meaning behind it. A week later, I ended up picking this CD up for myself, and the rest is history.  <br /> <br />I can't believe it took me all this time to realize what a lyrical genius Cash truly was, and that he was unlike others of his time. Trust me, this is coming from someone who is an appreciator of all things heavy metal for the most part. Anyway, some of his best songs can be found on this album, including \\"Ring of Fire\\", which I absolutely love. Along with that, there is one track that is truly powerful and can penetrate to the core. That track is \\"The Wanderer\\", which also happened to feature U2, I am so glad they put that track on this compilation. It's truly a beautiful song, and one of Johnny's best works in my books.  <br /> <br />So my summary is this, if you love good lyrics, good music, and are willing to try something out of the ordinary, try this album out for size. It truly is a work of art, and finally does Cash justice. May the Man in Black rest in peace knowing that he's still loved by thousands of his fans, including me, a man who did not realize what a genius he was until after his death. Thank you Mr. Cash for the memories.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I saw this film a couple of months ago but just haven't gotten around to reviewing it.  By now, of course, everyone knows the general plot.  And everyone has an opinion about this film whether he or she has seen this film or not.  The opinions tend to follow the person's views on the gay issue.  This seems a little unfair because I think a good film should stand by itself and not just be a reflection of a personal opinion about its theme.<br /><br />The credits are impressive.  Ang Lee directed it.  As always, he makes the audience really understand his characters.  The two cowboys, as played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenthal, become real and easily identifiable for their very human qualities.  The film is based on a short story by Annie Proulx.  She writes about the dark side of the American West, not the place of the great John Wayne myths.  The writer, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana are also experts on the west.  I would expect nothing but the best from them.<br /><br />The story is complex and more than the sum of its parts.  It starts in 1963 when the two young men spend a summer working together herding sheep on the lonely Brokeback Mountain.  For the entire summer, they have no other human companionship.  Naturally, a bond develops between them.  And then, on one cold and lonely night, they have a brief romantic encounter.  They both would like it to be only a one-time thing, but it isn't.  Their feelings grow for each other.  Later, they are discovered, go back to their respective lives, and try to forget each other.<br /><br />Both men marry.  Both have children.  The marriages are not happy.  And there are some scenes between these men and their wives that show the sadness and impact of these flawed marriages.  Then, several years later, the men come together again, and from then on, they spend several weeks each summer continuing their relationship on Brokeback Mountain.  They say they are going there to fish; but they never do bring home any fish.<br /><br />The story takes place over couple of decades.  It is a gloomy story, one that the audience knows will end badly.  There's fine acting, great scenery and everything else that deserves the accolades it received.<br /><br />Problem is, the film runs 134 minutes which is much too long.  The action is subtle and brings up unsettling emotions.  After a short while, I knew I had gotten the point of the film.  The storyline didn't really change and there were no surprises.  I found myself constantly looking at my watch.  If I had been home in front of my DVD I know I would have fallen asleep.<br /><br />I commend Brokeback Mountain for its breakthrough approach to a forbidden subject and some great acting.  It was just a little too slow for my taste.ish.    <br /> <br />The story takes place over couple of decades.  It is a gloomy story, one that the audience knows will end badly.

B00097DXZS|1.0|Despite the rootkit scandal of late 2005, Sony continues trying to sell copy protected CDs. Even if this copy protection software is less harmful than their last attempt, I only buy CDs that let me exercise my Fair Use rights under US copyright law to copy, back-up, and enjoy my music in any format and at any time I choose - whether on my MP3 player, my SlimServer, or my car CD player.  <br /> <br />Until the big labels get a clue about this and start treating their customers like, um, customers, and not crooks, they will continue to bleed money, and deserve it. <br /> <br />I'm even more disappointed that Carlos Santana went along with this. I thought he would know better than to mistrust his fans.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|There is no point re-hashing what many others have said before. No-one wants to buy this set for the 2004 edtions (surely there is no-one out there who wants that who didn't buy it already?) No, the attention here is on the so-called \\"bonus\\" features included with the set. These are not the films you're looking for! <br /> <br />Vote with your wallets and do not buy this edition. It does not contain the \\"theatrical version\\" of the film. It is a 1993 Laserdisc transfer which contains many changes from the theatrical releases. It also contains a version which falls far below the standard consumers would expect from a dvd release in 2006.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|I first became aware of new age crooner Michael Buble from his feisty duet with Holly Palmer on the period-appropriate title tune of the execrable retro-rom-com, 2003's \\"Down with Love\\". He seems to be joining Harry Connick, Jr. as the swinging heirs apparent to Sinatra, and the comparison is most apt once you hear his pleasing sophomore effort here. Produced by David Foster and Humberto Gatica, it's a slick package of carefully chosen songs that have been customized to fit the buttery contours of Buble's vocal stylings. From Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse's 1965 musical \\"The Roar of the Greasepaint/The Smell of the Crowd\\", the familiar \\"Feeling Good\\" is a nicely saucy opener, followed by an effectively lounge-lizard version of Gershwin's \\"A Foggy Day (in London Town)\\". A samba-flavored version of \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\" is also particularly winning.<br /><br />Buble wavers somewhat with his covers of Ray Charles (a soft-centered \\"You Don't Know Me\\"), the Beatles (an overly jazzed-up \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\"), Otis Redding (a syrupy \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\") and Marvin Gaye (a chug-a-lug version of \\"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\\" and a far cry from the yearning James Taylor cover). However, he finds surer footing when his delivery is more straightforward as with the self-penned \\"Home\\", Leon Russell's \\"A Song for You\\" (accompanied by the equally slick trumpeter Chris Botti and comparing quite well to Karen Carpenter's definitive version), Cole Porter's \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\", and a surprisingly tantalizing duet with Nelly Furtado on the Latin warhorse \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\". The singer saves the best for last with a plaintive cover of one of Stevie Wonder's best love songs, \\"You and I\\". There is a definite sense of commercial packaging about the whole recording that is a bit alienating, but Buble luckily transcends such preconceptions through sheer vocal panache.
B000002VMH|5.0|You've got to get this one. Usually cover songs are not that great when sung by other artists, but Annie does all the songs here much justice...great versions of even greater songs. I simply love Whiter Shade of Pale. Annie's got such a soulfully smooth vocal, you just can't help but be hooked from the first song. This one'll be a classic for a long time.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|Pearl Jam is not Nirvana. <br />They will never be Nirvana. <br />They suck.   <br />They have always sucked. <br />Their lead singer runs around on stage.  He doesn't play guitar.

0393327655|4.0|I am proud of Sam Harris for writing this book.  In many passages, I felt inspired and a bit regretful, as if I could or should have written them.  Non-believers and atheists tend to be the opposite of zealous, so it's refreshing to see a break in that stereotype.  Many of his remarks are right on the mark.  For some years, I have been saying things like: \\"superstition is the blasphemy of reason.\\" <br /> <br />I agree with some reviewers, however, in that I think the book goes too far.  Maybe I'm more optimistic than Sam -- I don't see religious \\"moderates\\" as worthy of targeting -- not in this way.  I think they are the result of a latent skepticism in most folks, as well as centuries of debate, scientific progress and a general trend  towards tolerance and liberty -- at least in the West. <br /> <br />I think this book, based on the reviews and my own experiences with people, is going to elicit mainly three responses.  Most atheists and freethinkers are going to read it with a feeling of \\"you're preaching to choir, brother,\\" as if Sam really isn't saying anything that shocking or revelatory.  The really hardcore fundamentalists are simply going to be dismissive of the whole thing -- maybe without even reading it.  The third response is going to come from what I guess is Sam's real target audience -- those who are in the middle, the religious \\"moderates.\\"  Unfortunately, his often sharp and acidic tone, instead of inspiring doubt and thought, may only end up as offensive or insulting. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, Sam Harris has a brilliant writing style.  I think  his raw talent with the written word is a delight to read -- this is an agile mind at work.  His arguments are cogent, and he anticipates objections.  It's a good book, but as I said, I have the feeling that it is his very tone that may turn some readers off or obscure the arguments themselves.  As much as I like to occasionally myself say things like, \\"Come on! All this religious stuff is just nonsense, weknow it, and let's face reality!\\" -- in my experience, I know this approach hardly ever has the desired effect.
0385336691|5.0|When you've got nine award-winning, bestselling books behind you, the tenth has got to be daunting.  But with THE HARD WAY, Lee Child doesn't just live up to his legacy--he surpasses it.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a thinking person's action hero: tough and physically daunting, sure, but more reliant on his wits than his fists.  And in this relentlessly paced thriller, he's stretched to the limit against a ruthless millionaire and his private army of Special Forces killers.<br /><br />Child is often credited with crafting plots that are impossible to put down, and that's well-deserved praise.  But equally true is that his work is stylish, beautifully rendered, and unapologetically smart.  He's a master, and THE HARD WAY is one of his best.
0316172324|5.0|At first glance I thought this would be a great book, it was!   <br /> <br />This book covers every aspect of snap judgements: when they are right, when they are wrong, and why.  The content of the book is mostly a series of fascinating and compelling examples (such as the story of an art fake scam, an accidental police killing, human face reading, etc.) In spite of the detail it never gets dry, dull or \\"academic\\".  <br /> <br />While I like a good page turner--and this book definitely is one--what I appreciated most about this book is it made me think about my own snap judgements. I highly recommend this title.
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|This is a fairly good album. It's being compared to Led Zeppelin, however, and that's just wrong. If any band from that era, they sound like Budgie. But maybe Budgie without the songwriting edge that made bands like Metallica cover them.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I had originally taken a wait and see stance on this upcoming DVD release and was reluctant to go along with the gloomy predictions that these would be non Anamorphic versions.<br />Having read the release from Lucasfilm, I am every bit as disappointed as other viewers on here.<br />Basically they are putting out a cheap and substandard product and saying this is as good as it gets, like it or lump it.<br /><br />Well guess what? I am going to avoid this dvd at all costs and strongly recommend other viewers to do the same.<br />George Lucas has every right to update and add new scenes to these films but equally if people wish to see the original versions, then Lucasfilm really should find an old print from somewhere and present a proper dvd restoration of the actual version of the film that went out and did the business in the cinemas on its original release.<br />Not recognising that and saying that all you can have is a remastered, non Anamorphic Laserdisc version is simply unacceptable.<br /><br />If you wish to see the original versions in a real Letterbox  picture then it will have to be on vhs. This version is still available if your old vhs tapes are becoming tired or you do not have a letterbox version of the original at all:<br />ASIN: B0001KO9QA. As I write there are examples of this for sale on Amazon with at least one claiming to be new.
B000CPH9I4|2.0|I bought this CD for my girlfriend who has gotten into Irish folk music just recently. She quite likes it but I was  disappointed with it. <br /> <br />The problem with The Corrs and some other Irish & English performers is that they feel a need to adopt a 'mid-atlantic' accent while singing, which means much of their native tongue goes missing. This works well for pop & rock etc but less so for folk singing. <br /> <br />Irish artists like Maura O'Connell, Mary Black or even Enya in a pinch could have performed any of these songs better than The Corrs. <br /> <br />I did note that acoustic guitars made in Northern Ireland were used on the CD - that was a nice touch. Otherwise The Corrs should stick to the bubble gum, eye candy pop singing they're used to.
0812550706|4.0|I thought that this book was great. It was about a small child who goes by the name of Ender. As a young boy a military force takes him to be trained as a soldier. He is not a normal boy though. He has been bred to be a genius in every way. Although he is a soldier he is being trained In a different type of war. It is a war in space, which is being fought against another species. He does not realize it until later but he is being isolated from all the other children in his class. Although this seems mean it is necessary to make him strong. He is being trained not just to be a soldier but to be a general. He is slowly but surely being driven insane.  <br /> <br />Throughout the book you get a few paragraphs each chapter that explain the feelings of the commanders and why they are doing what they are doing. I Thought that this added very well to the story and was a very good idea. Although I do not want to give away the ending of the book I will say it was a complete surprise and very good. <br /> <br />  <br />
0440241588|2.0|For a temporary descent into a fast paced five & dime, I usually like Grisham. I really felt cheated though. Too much of the book reads like a travelogue of Bologna. Please make  greater effort next time. I'm with those who said that Grisham really did not know how to end this one. The end, while listening to it on audio CD, was very abrupt. <br /> <br />Not my favourite by a longshot.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Even though I'm a big science-fiction fan who watches Fox more than any other network, I somehow managed to never see an episode of Firefly.  That means I came on board the Serenity with basically no knowledge at all about the series or the characters.  Naturally, I now plan on watching the Firefly episodes in the near future, but there is a very real chance I will say something in this review that will be deemed rather stupid by loyal fans - but, rest assured, I intend to have nothing but good things to say about this movie.  It definitely can be enjoyed on its own merits, but I did feel as if I were missing out on some background, especially in terms of the recent war and the true natures of the Alliance, the colonists on the outer, wilder worlds, and of course the Reavers.  It was also a little hard to fully embrace the heroes at first because - well, they are basically criminals who aren't averse to leaving a few bodies in their wake when they do a job.  These are deep characters, however, and it takes time to get to know them, especially Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), who seems to run hot and cold all the time.  Of course, his mood swings are nothing compared to those of River Tam (Summer Glau), the young psychic super-girl currently being protected by Mal and his crew.  River was trained by the Alliance government to be a superhuman with extrasensory powers and lethal fighting skills.  I must say I always enjoy watching a woman stomp mudholes in wave after wave of bad guys - and this girl doesn't bother with taking any names when she gets her groove on.  What a woman!<br /><br />River was saved from her life as an Alliance-controlled guinea pig of death by her brother, who can be a little annoying in a Jerry O'Connell sort of way.  Naturally, the Alliance wants her back - not just for whom and what she is but also for the highly classified information she might have gleaned from people in authority.  Since she doesn't officially exist, the government can't just put out an interstellar APB on her; instead, they send in a smooth-talking, highly trained assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who doesn't let a little thing like countless innocent deaths get in the way of his mission.  As for Mal and some of his crew, they aren't even sure they want to keep River around anymore, especially after she goes Bruce Lee on a whole bar full of tough hombres for no discernible reason.  It's bad enough the Alliance is gunning for them just for having her onboard, but it starts to look like she could be a danger to them in and of herself.  Mal wants to know what secret she has buried in her fragile brain, though - given the hated Alliance's determined effort to find and eliminate her, he knows it must be a real threat to their position and power.  He's right, of course.<br /><br />Serenity is a remarkable movie - nay, concept - in many ways.  The very story itself represents a unique take on science fiction (although I can't say I saw a lot of Firefly's vaunted Western tie-in in the movie), one built on fascinating characters as much as futuristic technology and marvelous (and they are marvelous, by the way) shoot-'em-ups in space.  The ever-ingenious Joss Whedon likes to diverge from common wisdom and prove all the \\"it will never work\\" critics wrong, and part of that involves some pretty unexpected fates for his characters here in this big-budget crowd-pleaser of a feature film.  I can see where fans of the Firefly series might come away rather shocked on a couple of occasions.<br /><br />I could quibble about a couple of things in the film (such as the melodramatic romantic pause at one point just before the climax and the bad guy's decision to risk his life going after the hero when he had ample opportunity to just blow the guy's brains out as easy as you please), but I won't.  Serenity is a great movie and the ultimate vindication for Joss Whedon and his hand-picked actors who were mismanaged and then dropped mercilessly and far too quickly by Fox.  These TV execs gave the horrendously over-marketed and downright weak Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., a full year to prove itself, yet they axed Joss Whedon's Firefly after a mere 11 episodes (which they didn't even show in the right order)?  How stupid was that?  Just look at the rave reviews and sales of both Firefly and Serenity.  The show deserved better, and Serenity proves Mr. Universe right - they really can't stop the signal.  Let's hope there are further Serenity adventures to come - in any format.r too quickly by Fox.

1878424319|5.0|I received The Four Agreements this week and read it a just a few hours. It is a quick read that seemed more like a conversation to me.<br /><br />Ruiz shares that we are living in a dream (or nightmare) and have a choice to live in a New Dream. He writes about how this dream has come to be and what choice we have in how our 'dream' appears.<br /><br /> One of my favorite passages in this book is how he speaks about 'true justice'. He goes on the share that most of us allow ourselves to be punished 'a thousand times' for a single mistake by the \\"Judge\\" (our inner judge), \\"Book of Law\\" (our belief system) and \\"Victim\\" (carrier of blame, guilt and shame) that we use to filter our beliefs (agreements). \\"The human is the only animal to pay a thousand times for the same mistake. The other animals pay once for every mistake that we make.\\" This spoke so loudly to me.<br /><br />Ruiz explains that this is not an easy task, but that it can be done. He offers us this choice: \\"Maybe we cannot escape from the destiny of the human, but we have a choice: to suffer our destiny or to enjoy our destiny.\\" I choose to enjoy it!<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to live a new experience of simplicity, happiness and freedom.

B000AMJDHY|4.0|I got this CD after a slight obsession with \\"I write Sins not Tragedies\\"... and I still will have to say that it is one of the best tracks on the disc. <br /> <br />This CD is great, defintely for fans of Fall Out Boy.  They have pretty strong lyrics though, and a few songs may offend people, (One being \\"There's a good Reason these Tables are  Numbered Honey, you just Haven't Thought of it Yet\\", not only a painfully long title, but also over-the-edge-lyrics.  Personally I take offense to the line, 'I'm the new cancer never looked better', I don't know whether they're referring to the disease or not, but I think it is uncalled for.)  Another song with the disturbing lyrics is \\"Lying is the Most Fun a Girl can Have without Taking her Clothes off\\".  It starts out okay, but a certain word is repeatedly used.... Let's just say I wouldn't feel comfortable listening to this one with my parents. <br /> <br />On the other hand.... \\"Time to Dance\\" is a great track.  Most of the lyrics are great, the background music, the melody.  I can't get over that one, or stop singing along.  \\"The Only Difference between Martyrdom and Suicide is Press Coverage\\", \\"London Beckoned Songs about Money Written by Machines\\", and \\"I Constantly Thank God for Esteban\\" are the other highly recommended tracks. <br /> <br />Okay, but certainly not great, songs that I could probably become accustomed to loving include, \\"Nails for breakfast, Tacks for Snacks\\", \\"Camisado\\", \\"But its Better if you do\\", and \\"Build God, then we'll Talk\\" (although this one also has some... let's say, interesting, lyrics.) <br /> <br />Overall, the CD is really good.  I've recommended it to all of my friends, who also love it.  ...  My parents don't, but that's another story.
B000EGF0B4|3.0|When I first heard of this movie it had a small hype, as it delt with the contraversial subject of homosexual cowboys in the 60's.  The first thing that grabbed my attention, was the sheer brilliance in cinematography.  The landscape and surroundings of Brokeback Mountain is extremely detailed and rich in colour.  The relationship between the two leads becomes stronger and stronger as the the film goes on.  Until the both sleep in a tent together and instinctively embrace.  The story continues with their relationship as they both turn seperate ways and try to live their lives, resisting the urge to be together.  Their relationship is obviously complicated as they can't be seen together in public, and the only way they can see each other is Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />Their are terrific performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall (spelt wrong, I know), as they struggle with their lives.  Although their is some fantastic acting, it is the story and the way it was told that let it down for me.  The story wasn't as powerful and as emotional as I had expected.  Their are also a few uncomfortable scenes dealing with domestic violence that are brilliantly acted out.<br /><br />Overall, this was an OK film, and a film that everyone would enjoy.<br />P.S.  I know a lot of people really like this film, but for me it was the story that dissapointed me.  If the story was better, I would give this film 4 stars.
1592401791|5.0|I think I've read all the books written about The Beatles...yes, I do admit it. Some shed insight, others rehash and some tell you what you already know. This one, however, is quite different. It's a unique perspective on a unique band. You learn all about them through their time in the recording studio. If you're a musician or a music techie, you'll absolutely love the inside scoop on how they achieved their sounds and how they approached their musical journeys. If you don't care about stuff like that, you'll love it anyway because Geoff Emerick takes you right into the world so few had the privilege of entering...the studio. He tells the story from his perspective and what he viewed as the years went by, never really knowing what was going on in the Beatles personal lives, but sensing their mood swings and ups and downs. If you're a real Beatles fan and know what was going on in their lives during the times Geoff speaks about, you have a greater understanding as to why and how they did the songs they did at those particular moments. If not, it doesn't really matter because it's an easy read, a lot of fun and you'll gain a lot of insight and appreciation for what was musically accomplished in a world where computers did not play a part in the recording process. <br />
0316666343|4.0|I have never read a book so captivating; it is at once deeply moving, utterly disturbing, inspiring, wonderful, gripping, eye opening, passionate, and beautifully beautifully written. Alice Sebold writes from extremely personal experiences, with every word intended and full of emotion and meaning. I was taken for a rollercoaster ride into a world I probably never would've understood had it not been for this carefully written novel. <br />However, with that said, I was somewhat unhappy with the ending; the book, overall, questions the spiritual world and of its possibilities, but I still found it slightly too unrealistic. ..But I guess it's just my own opinion! <br />This book is HIGHLY recommended... It's one of my favourites!
B000F5GNX8|4.0|This movie was exhilarating. It sometimes seems to me that most of the action and street level films coming out lately move so slowly that they fall apart trying to attain \\"gritty realism\\" or swing the other way to achieve blockbuster status by eschewing chunks of plot or dialog for more explosions and baddie clad extras to swell body counts. Against that backdrop this film makes for a true diamond in the rough treasure.<br /><br />The story, such as it is, corkscrews through Hollywood, made almost realistic by the surreal backdrop of insane behaviors that are attached to glitter-town. A cast of characters quirky enough to fit in, or even make a scene, is dropped into the pot along with a few dead bodies, a mental institution, a big bad rich-`n-powerful king-pin type, and a slew of gun-toting mercenaries. Now take that lovely hornets nest and Shake Well. However, the way everything fits together (I'm not even going to TRY to explain the plot) is a sideline to the film's real attraction.<br /><br />THE REAL ATTRACTION: This movie comes from the same pen that scripted our favorite action movies during their golden age (think Die Hard and Lethal Weapon). A marvelous wash of insane happenstances, surprising behaviors, never-say-die swashbuckling, and absolutely-positively-indubitably PERFECT one-liners rule this film like a peyote riding panoply of chaos gods. This movie is FUN. I busted a gut for hours from the dark humor laid side-by-side with the best wisecracks and low shots I've heard from any film in years.<br /><br />Whatever faults this movie has (I'm sure others will describe those in detail), this is a Really, Really FUN movie. Check it out.
0345440900|5.0|I am a second time Mom and I used Baby Whisperer with my first son. I was stressed out after having no luck with teaching my son to fall asleep on his own.  After reading and following Tracy's advice for the pick-up put-down method, I was amazed at how easy it worked.  I used it again with my second son and like clock work both of my boys are perfect sleepers.  My [...] takes 2 2 hour naps a day and my [...] takes a 2 hour one as well.   They fall asleep easily and confidently because they know how.  You just have to trust the method and follow it without giving in even if you are on your 14th pick up.    I read some of the other reviews and with reference to the feeding, I did not use Tracy's advice because I wasn't struggling with that aspect.  Mostly you have to trust yourself and that is how you have to look at ALL child rearing/ sleeping books, do what you think is right, but know that I think Tracey is dead on with the sleeping method.  I love this book and Tracy so much I have bought this book for all my new Mom friends, it is a must!
B00000272N|5.0|Facelift pretty much happened when hair metal was receiving its final nail in the coffin and grundge was becoming more of a household name. The first single of this album was Man in the Box, a great incorporation of guitar, trembling basslines and timely tempoed drumming, and Layne Staley's haunting melodic vocals, Perhaps their hardest song and most famous song that they came out with. This album has a very raw, emotional feel to it. Every song here has its own personality here from psychedelic, too metal and through headbanging. Jerry Cantrell was one of the most underrated guitarist in the new Seattle scene of grunge(although I think basically it was more metal than grunge, simply because it had very few alternative elements then grunge). He knew how to make more than 3 chord progression and had some good solos and licks, and actually wrote the majority of the songs. The bass-lines was very audible, jazzy and crunchy, just listen to Man in the Box to listen to a strong and tremble bass. The drums were very good, Sean Kinney kept every thing on perfect tempo from slow emotional to fast and violent. Layne Staley had a great vocal range from melodic to growlish at points(RIP) Best songs here are We Die Young, Man In the Box, Bleed the Freak,Love Hate love and I know something About you. But this still great from start to finish, and even with the price it has right now pick this up, its classic metal.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing movie. It breaks all of the boundaries of movie, and protrayed true love as it is. It is sad that, even in the 21st Century, people still classify love rather than accepting it as a universal energy as it is. This movie deserves your every penny, and if you haven't bought it, I feel sorry for you.

B000EPR7NE|5.0|I bought The Da Vinci Code soundtrack for \\"Chevaliers De Sangreal\\" alone. However, I knew that the rest of the soundtrack was a smash. The last sequence of the film is one of those rare moments that fill an audience with pride and I believe Hans's music had a lot to do with it. It's one of the better soundtracks I've heard in a while. It's fabulously eerie.
0307277674|1.0|I generally use the Da Vinci code as a litmus test to weed out intelligent folk from the masses. Less than 30 pages into this trite, useless book that relies on sitcom hinges and the average person lack of historical knowledge, I wanted to stab my eyes out with a plastic spork.<br /><br />Even when borrowed from the library, you've paid too high a fine to read this trash.
0307277674|2.0|I first read Dan Brown's `The Da Vinci Code' a good long while ago and didn't think all that much of it.  However, with the release of the film and the endless chatter about it on the TV, I revisited the novel to give it another go.  Here's pretty much what I thought of it this time around.<br /><br />PLOT - rooted in shadowy conspiracies and enigmatic puzzles, this aspect of the book is its strength.  You keep turning the pages to discover the resolution to each mystery and Brown is canny enough to pace them between very short chapters that are weighted with strong narrative hooks. To be forthright (without hopefully spoiling it altogether)the novel concerns a professor who discovers that various secret societies have sought to either suppress or protect the hidden truth that Jesus actually married and began a bloodline.<br /><br />CHARACTER - these are mostly 2D and are little more than puppets to shift around the scenery.  At no point in the novel will you find yourself thinking \\"wow, Dan...that's great insight into the human psyche you have there\\" or anything like that.  Instead you will meet numerous caricatures emitting streams of either functional or cheesy dialogue, with the very worst being Sir Leigh Teabing who is the least convincing Englishman since Dick Van Dyke appeared in `Mary Poppins'.<br /><br />PROSE - the writing drifts from the reasonable to the childishly farcical on a paragraph by paragraph basis.  Throughout Brown seems to have the idea of keeping it simple, average and unchallenging to hit the widest audience possible - or at least I hope so as the man teaches creative writing, and if this is his best then his students should be asking for a refund.<br /><br />BIGGER PICTURE - it is impossible to review the book without mentioning the number of statements it makes about history, religion and art.  On the first reading I knew it had errors as I've studied a few conspiracy theories myself, but it is only now with the intense amount of research thrown at it that I've realised just how many glaring inaccuracies it manages in 605 pages.  To state, every vital element of the story is somehow flawed, and that includes not only the apparent `facts' concerning the genuine existence of the Priory Of Scion and the monks of Opus Dei (i.e., the Priory of Scion is an owned-up-to hoax and Opus Dei has no monks), but also details about Leonardo's life and work, the basic geography of Paris and London, the contents of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the architects/architecture of numerous churches,  the history of the Templars, the history and organisation of the Catholic Church, the historical lineage of various spiritual symbols and even technical information concerning firearms and computers.  In short, the book is more or less one long series of total mistakes, and consequently Brown should have done a bit more research before shoving out a novel with the word FACT emblazoned across the top of the first page.<br /><br />To conclude, `The Da Vinci Code' is worth a look if you fancy a bit of lightweight fluff on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but it is certainly not as good as either `The Dumas Club' by Arturo Perez-Reverte or `The Shadow of the Wind' by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, which are also filled with puzzles and dark enclaves galore.<br /><br />For myself, Brown's novel will always be the impoverished cousin, twice removed, of Umberto Eco's stunning and erudite `Foucault's Pendulum', which truly deserves to be read and reread as an example of faultless narrative art.  Unlike Brown, Eco's writing has a message which has been researched thoroughly enough to withstand academic scrutiny: a message which concerns the often fatal human proclivity to build castles made of conspiracy theories in the air. It then perhaps serves as truly the best novel to function as an antidote to any potential Da Vinci Code fever.ed just how many glaring inaccuracies it manages in 605 pages.

0385336691|3.0|I've read all the Reacher novels...they seem to get more and more boring with much less action than the earlier books.  This novel has Reacher endlessly searching the streets of New York, doing his detective work the \\"hard way\\"...then searching through England doing the same thing, with lots of boring descriptions of New York and London.....his way is the hard way and the \\"boring way\\".  Please.....Reacher is an action guy...not a detective looking for clues.  The only way we know he is a \\"tough guy\\" is that he keeps telling everyone how tough he is because he was an MP!  Don't tell us, Jack, show us!   The last two novels Child has written have him solving mysteries, with little or no action, until, possibly, the last few pages.  Come on, Lee ...bring back the action man - at least let him bang a few heads around every few pages! The appeal with Reacher is his supposed willingness to do \\"whatever it takes\\" to solve the problem.  Lately, he's just following police procedures ad nauseum!  Even the end of this novel leaves some gaping holes/mistakes that Reacher normally wouldn't make!  Hope the next one is better!
0425098478|1.0|I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read. <br /> <br />There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school. <br /> <br />Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it.

B00005JLXE|1.0|Mark Steven Johnson's Daredevil is nothing like the great Marvel comic it claims to adapt itself from. This terrible film has characters named after Matt Murdock, Daredevil Bullseye, Elektra and Kingpin but none of the story and spirit of its source material. An incoherent collage of comic book panels come to life, this movie is just for diehard fanboys of the comic only.<br /><br />The movie starts off in a church with DD falling off a rooftop onto the floor then flashes back to the past. I tell ya, when a movie starts off with a flashback that's NEVER a good sign. We see a young Matt Murdock growing up poor in Hell's kitchen. A good kid, he honors his dock worker/former boxer father by doing well in school, He's about to show him a straight A report card, he sees his father roughing up some guys for the mob. Ashamed, he runs away and the last thing he sees is a toxic chemicals spraying him in the face. It actually happened differently in the comics, but you'll just have to pick up a copy of Daredevil # vol.1 no 1 or The Essential Daredevil for those facts.<br /><br />Later on in the hospital (how'd he get there? And how'd we get there) he learns his senses are so enhanced he's about to go crazy from sensory overload. He gets control of himself and-well- this isn't explained to us. After his father is killed by the mob, The movie cuts to years later showing us him in a red suit and mask as Daredevil with no explanation to why he has decided to become a superhero or what motivated him to do so. You know, it would have been very helpful for us to SEE those HELPFUL frames of him dedicating himself to becoming a lawyer as a promise to his Dad, training with his sensei Stick, or working towards the goal in law school, or meeting up with Foggy Nelson in law school like he did in the comics and planning to work together in a law firm then hiring Karen Page. I'd also like to have seen Murdock doing some investigation into his father's murder along the way like he did in the first issue of Daredevil. This would have built up the weak story that goes nowhere.<br /><br />Well, we see finally Daredevil in action. He's chasing down a criminal and fights him in a subway station. After beating him up a train passes through the station causing him sensory overload. DD soon recovers and knocks the guy on the tracks another train (I wish trains came right after each other like that here in the city. It would really be helpful during rush hour) comes by and runs the guy over. That's when I knew this wasn't a real Daredevil movie. Daredevil NEVER KILLS. NEVER.<br /><br />We get some scenes introducing reporter Ben Urich and cops investigating the Daredevil sighting. Urich lights a \\"DD\\" left on the subway platform. Like any dark brooding hero would leave a highly combustible calling card to go along with the guy who he just murdered. We now see Murdock going to work after attending church Confession. He's at the trial of a rapist. He says something about justice being blind but can see and I start thinking about Ramy Zada and the old Dark Justice TV show. The guy gets off and DD goes after him and kills him. But he's one of kingpin's men. We learn of his murder as Natchios is trying to break away from the mob run by Kingpin. Kingpin enlists Bullseye to kill Natchios. Instead of explaining things we see his daughter Elektra (The first Red-haired pale skinned Greek woman I've ever seen) run into Matt Murdock and Foggy at a coffee shop. Playa tries to get those digits and that leads to a fight in a park. The worst scene in the movie. Just fast-forward through it. A convoluted romance leads to and an invitation to a ball. After meeting up with Elektra, he soon surmises that Natchios is in danger after she leaves abruptly. He suits up as Daredevil. Tell me, how do you get a bulky leather jacket pants, and biker boots under a tux and have it look so neat? As Natchios limo drives off, Bullseye rolls up on his motorbike and goes into action. DD tries tostop the hit, but Bullseye gets his man with DD's own weapon.<br /><br />Blaming DD for her father's death Elektra decides not to go into witness protection-but to become a costumed vigilante. We get some frames of her working out then on her way to going after DD with no build-up. Bullseye just shows up and kills this highly trained fighter in less time it takes to butter some popcorn. There's some drama and DD gets his mask taken off. He puts it back on and then we have our big fight between DD and BE which takes us back to the beginning of the film. The priest takes off his mask then puts it back on and scurries out so the final battle begins. DD kills Bullseye then shows up for his final battle with Kingpin. Beating Kingpin, he decides to have a change of heart and not kill him. Instead, he leaves telling him saying the cops know who he is even though this was never shown to the audience! The movie ends with some soliloquy about being the defender of Hell's kitchen or some nonsense.<br /><br />Mark Steven Johnson's Daredevil fails because of its director's inability to tell a story with pictures. Scenes don't transition into one another; stuff just happens because he wants it to with no clear explanation of why they happen. All of the frames don't come together seamlessly to tell a complete story. I really wish the director of this film had THOUGHT of the general audience of moviegoers instead of pandering to diehard comic book fans. Everyone isn't a comic book fanboy and doesn't know the origin of Daredevil by heart. If you never read the comic you'll never understand this movie. Then again, I've read the comics and I STILL don't understand what this movie was about.<br /><br />Ben Affleck is a horrible Murdock/Daredevil. He only has one facial expression throughout the movie. Jennifer Garner is decent Elektra, but doesn't fit the part She would have been more believable as Natasha Romanov, The Black Widow though. Jon Faverau is a solid Foggy Nelson. Colin Farrell is a dull Bullseye. He gets the crazy part of the character down perfect, but tones things down too much. Bullseye is over the top evil like the Joker, and I didn't get that from him. Michael Clarke Duncan struggles with the Kingpin; I think he could have done more with the role, but the writing wasn't there. Joe Pantliano is a perfect as Ben Urich the reporter.<br /><br />Pass this DullDevil by and pick up one of the better superhero movies like the first Spider-Man, Batman Begins, or The Incredibles.llseye gets his man with DD's own weapon. <br />Blaming DD for her father's death Elektra decides not to go into witness protection-but to become a costumed vigilante.

0394800389|5.0|back in college we made a drinking game out of trying to read this book...
0307263118|3.0|_The Sea_ is quite a bit like Virginia Woolf's _To the Lighthouse_ in conception & also in its relatively prolix use of language.  As in Woolf's masterpiece, \\"Several times on every page the reader is arrested by a line or sentence that demands to be read again,\\" as _The Sunday Telegraph_ says.  I found this to be true in the first half of _The Sea_ as I grew used to Banville's distinctive style.  By the second half of the book my interest began to wane in Max Morden's itinerant consciousness, no matter how extraordinary Banville's way with words.  Either I was not in the mood for a relatively pretentious old man's often sexual stream of consciousness (which, believe me, I am definitely open to) or something is missing in Banville's equation.  It could well be a combination of the two.  I find that what _To the Lighthouse_ has that _The Sea_ doesn't is soul.  One is never far from passion with Woolf, whereas in Banville it seems Morden is in the midst of a lifelong search for something to be passionate about.  Again, this could be gripping, but in Banville's hands it ends up seeming like so much finely-wrought blather by the end.<br /><br />And the end is about as overwrought and predictable as high modernist style gets.  I think I've read more or less the same ending in maybe five or so other novels.  Not as \\"innovative\\" as some would have you think.  Some critics and writers complained when Banville won the Booker, saying something like a book this difficult shouldn't win a major award.  That piqued my interest, 'cause sometimes the more difficult the better.  It's not its difficulty that should have held it back from the Booker; it's more like the fact that the life ebbs out of it by mid-point.  A novel like that should never win a major award and there were plenty of novels last year that managed to keep life in their pages through to the end.<br /><br />One of the highlight reviews anticipated a view like mine, and I can acknowledge that this book could be someone else's cup of tea, specifically someone who has gone through the death of a significant other.  Still, though I've never lost a significant other to death, I know a writer can do a lot better than this.  We only get to certain parts of Max Morden's psyche, not what Robert Olen Butler would call his \\"white hot center.\\"  I can't help but think that this has something to do with Banville's use of his skills.someone else's cup of tea, specifically someone who has gone through the death of a significant other.

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|I had heard a lot about this movie, and was fairly eager to see it.  I just finished watching it, so, while it's still fresh in my mind, I thought I'd say something about it. <br /> <br />It's true - it's less about the transgender lifestyle, more about human conflict.  I didn't go into it thinking, \\"Oh, this is that transgender movie,\\" and I was hardly disappointed when it took another turn. <br /> <br />It's a real gem.  I'm not going to go into the plot, but it was well-thought out, and always interesting.  It's the bittersweet story of a woman struggling to find her identity, dealing with the past of the man called Stanley... <br /> <br />I hate to be too cliche, but... I laughed, I cried, and I loved every minute of it.  It moved along at just the right pace, the story unfolding one piece at a time.  Just a tremendous film.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|THE best Robert Plant solo effort to date!  Take a little Led Zep, throw in some world flavors, add a bunch of great musicians and you've got a hit. If the music biz was not in the state it is in today, this album would have been topping the charts. If you're a Led Zep fan, Plant fan or simply a newbie, I highly recommend you give this one a listen. You won't be disappointed.
B00001U0DP|5.0|There are movies that have to made. This is one.   <br /> <br />The Holocaust has in these times become a part of everyday life. Read the news, look around you. These months Iran's psychotic president never fails to bring it up.  Neither do Holocaust deniers, apologists, the Arab press, historians, the anti-defamation league, the ACLU, Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Israelis, Americans... I won't go on. And here we have this movie, which is a gem. <br /> <br />There are many aspects of this movie that make it a five star movie if not a \\"classic\\" yet. I want to touch on these so that those who have not seen the movie or own the movie consider keeping it in their DVD collection for those times...  <br /> <br />First, the Italian bravado for life and love and the good things, similar to the great film Mediteraneo; Second, the humanity of those who believe that la vita e bella, even during a pandemic of human psychosis and hate (sound familiar); Third, the story, which allows us to see at the same time horror but laughter, and laughter is the best medicine; and finally, the unique flow of the movie. If Roberto Benigni, the directors, the camera crew, and the screen writers only made one film, this film, they would still have contributed a masterpiece and could retire. It is  funny, horrific, but ultimately redeeming. It is a movie that one never tires of watching. <br /> <br />Those Italians, dio mio! You laugh and cry at the same time, an emotional experience that runs the gamut. How do they do it? So ife is beautiful even if the movie is not perfect.  If you are feeling (strongly!) that it is not, watch this film. One never exhausts of it.   <br />   <br />Gabriel Elias
B00005JOE8|5.0|it is a great movie. I did not expect this kind of movie from Americans. The movie, undoubtedly, will make a lot of Americans feel very uncomfortable (upset) because it draws a lot of parallels with the present. My complimets go to the writers and directors who made such a daring movie.
B00003CXA4|5.0|I first saw this movie in high school in the theater.  I was extremely moved by the film, and it triggered a facination with South Asia that lasts to this day - I even work half the year in Sri Lanka now.  So for me, personally, this movie is of tremendous influence. <br /> <br />I understand the arguements about the crediting of non-white actors; I always wondered why Candice Bergman is given top billing, given that she only appears in a very few scenes.  Well, that's the way of the world - it's marketing right or wrong, and to get people into the theater you highlight those who are well known.  It's not right, but that's Hollywood. I mean, better to have unfair credits than to not have the movie at all, yes? <br /> <br />And you've got to admit, it was quite a debut for Ben Kingsly. Wow.  He'll be forever known for this role. <br /> <br />That aside, this is an excellent, amazing film.  Of course, it's still highly relevant, perhaps even more so in our post-911 world of fear.   <br /> <br />The movie ends with a feeling of real hope and inspiration.  A must-see for anyone who feels anger, fear, agressively nationalistic, hopelessness, hatred, or lost.  I can think of several politicans who need to see this movie.
B00005JOVH|4.0|The third installment of this movie adaptation of the Marvel comic book franchise brings the quest of a group of super mutants for acceptance and survival to its climax with the development by humans of an antidote to this genetic mutation, which they consider as a disease, thus curing the mutant race which will end the discrimination and hostilities brought about by their differences so that each other can live side by side in peace and harmony. The mutants must therefore choose whether to remain as they are or become humans and lose their super powers.  <br /> <br />True to the trend of a summer blockbuster, this comic book adaptation is an action-packed, high-budgeted, adrenaline-pumping arsenal of explosions and computerized special effects but within its seemingly mindless entertainment package comes a metaphor for the universal ideals of uniqueness/individuality and the eternal battle of good and evil. One is asked, would you rather be a normal person or be different and unique? Would you use your individuality and uniqueness for the promulgation of goodness and humanity? Or would you rather be wicked to serve your self-interest? X-Men 3 will give you the answers and other possibilities to these questions.  <br /> <br />This film offers a dose of excitement and adrenaline-pumping entertainment with some philosophy on the sides. Watch it and enjoy and do some thinking okay?  <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|It would be a gift to me, and everyone who has the capacity to  TOOL, for those poeple who do not, (a much greater portion) to just not listen to them. Ignorance makes this music extremely difficult, if not imppossible to listen to. Which in turn makes it just that much more enjoyable for the few who can begin to comprehend and then relate to this music. <br />  This is not a good album for you.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I bought this set sight unseen.So I was takening a financial gamble when I purchased this one.But I was pleasantly surprised when I love every episode of the first season.Some of my favs are babel, Past Prologue,Duet and In the hands of the prophets.
0385504209|2.0|After struggling it through the first 40 pages, I was hooked on the story like the 40 million other readers, but I did have a hard time with the writing style in the beginning. Once the story starts moving, it pulls you along. Religion adds a bit of spice but otherwise doesn't matter: the Holy Grail is just another \\"MacGuffin,\\" an object the characters care about but the reader doesn't.<br /><br />Still, while reading on, I was occasionally taken aback by obvious mistakes of details, such as Sophie Neveu as an educated Frenchwoman who doesn't know what a keystone is, which is taught in elementary school. This book messes with geography, which even fiction usually doesn't. One look at the map of the Paris area, for example, will show you that Chateau-Villette can't be both near Versailles and to the Northwest of Paris, as Versailles is to the Southwest. It can't be near Le Bourget either, because Le Bourget is in the Northeast. And if Le Bourget is a small airport, how can it manage to hold the world's largest aerospace trade show every other year?
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|(Please note: This is for the 4 disc director's cut--for some reason this is combined with ALL versions of the movie including the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray features ONLY the first two discs of this set on one Blu-ray disc. None of the discs with extras are included as part of the package).<br /><br />Sometimes longer is better particularly when you have a complex story. The theatrical version of \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" was flawed from the beginning with significant narrative gaps that undermine the character development and the smooth momentum of the story. That's because Fox had Scott cut the film by nearly an hour deleted significant and important character development at the expense of trying to fit in more showings per theater. The result was a sprawling ambitious project that had the epic scope of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" without the narrative strength. Thank God for DVD. \\"Kingdom of Heaven: The Director's Cut\\" restores the material demonstrating that the original 3 hour cut was a brilliant film that played theatrical late last year after the film had bombed at the box office. The reason the film bombed was the idiotic decision to cut the film and make it shorter reducing the film's impact. While it might not have made a huge amount of money it would have done well at the box office as a prestige film AND would have deservedly been nominated for Oscars. Much of the background story is fleshed out and the relationships between the various characters are more clearly defined. \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is a magnificent epic film that recalls the power of David Lean's epics and allows Scott's historical drama to breath. If you've seen the theatrical cut you owe it to yourself to see this major film from a major talent.<br /><br />The film is presented like the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" deluxe sets with the film spread over two discs. Featuring a beautiful anamorphic transfer this version of the film actually looks superior with less issues with digital artifacts when compared to the previous edition of the film. The 5.1 audio presentation sounds wonderful with both a 5.1 and 5.1DTS track that makes exceptional use of the format. You'll feel like you've put plopped down into the middle of the battle sequences in the action sequences and there's wonderful ambient sound effects sprinkled throughout the film even during sequences that are dialogue driven.<br /><br />Special features are terrific in this set. We start off with an introduction by Scott discussing the \\"Director's Cut\\" compared to the theatrical version of the film. Featuring Scott, writer William Monahan and actor Orlando Bloom the first commentary track (it was recorded separately and pieced together) becomes a rich resource of trivia beginning with the origin of the project and how Scott and Monahan ended up working together. The second commentary track has visual effects director Wes Sewell, assistant director Adam Somner and producer Lisa Elizey discussing the technical aspects of the shoot and the challenges they faced covering everything from the use of digital and on set effects to second unit photography. The last commentary has editor Dody Dorn discussing the two different versions of the film. We also have production notes and information about the shooting of the film provided as text commentary.<br /><br />The third and fourth discs have most of the supplements. Unfortunately neither has the excellent A&E documentary that was part of the two disc set so you may want to hold on to your other set if you haven't sold it already. We have \\"The Path to Redemption\\" presented in six separate parts with each running anywhere from a half  hour to twenty minutes a piece covering the making of the film.  The first of the three parts include text, images, early screenplay drafts and notes on the shooting of the movie. The second part has cast rehearsals covering everything from the training with the weapons to costume tests. The third of the three parts has storyboards as well as a short documentary featuring scholars discussing the accuracy of the film.<br /><br />The fourth disc features the last three parts on the film and includes video shot on location, storyboard galleries and photo galleries as well as deleted/extended/alternate scenes with optional commentary by Scott and editor Dorn. There's also a section on the visual effects of the film as well as various sound elements to create the unique sound mix of the film presented in various stages. The last section features trailers, TV spots, the Showest presentation. There's also footage from various premieres around the world, poster galleries, footage of the press junket shot on video, image and poster galleries as well as a brief featurette similar to the one done for \\"Gladiator: The Extended Version\\" that discussed the creation of this special edition.<br /><br />An exceptional film that was badly butchered by Fox prior to its premiere due to skittish leadership at Fox, the film has finally been presented the way it should have been in the first place.

B00005JOVN|3.0|This is a re-make of the 1970's disaster film The Poseidon Adventure by blockbuster-director Wolfgang Petersen of Troy and The Perfect Storm fame. Passengers of the titanic cruise ship Poseidon, found themselves in survival mode after a runaway tidal wave hits and capsizes their vessel. Their only way to survive is go to the base part of the liner, which is now at the top. Unlike the Academy Award-winning blockbuster, Titanic (a romantic-drama set in a cataclysmic situation), this movie is an action-adventure journey for the characters to make their way to the top of the ship.               <br /> <br />30 years ago, effects in disaster films were done mechanically. Today, with the advent of computer-generated images and a high-budget cost of production, disaster films are made much more thrilling and much more shocking to its viewers, for which reason this re-make is justifiable. The impact of the original Poseidon however, was not in its adventure and realistic shocking effects but rather in its depiction of primal fear and the instinct to survive. The original succeeded due to the superb dynamic characterization brought to life by the exceptional talents of its actors notably, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. This re-make fails to sustain the intensity of the original for it lacks the portrayal of humanity in its most primal state. This new version rather portrayed one-dimensional static characters with one goal in mind--to survive. In other words, this movie is just an adventure-filled voyage to survival. <br /> <br />Watching the film won't bore its viewers though. It is a 105-minute adrenaline-pumping ride of entertainment, akin to the trend of a summer blockbuster. Again, watch it if you want some dose of adrenaline rush and excitement in your viewing pleasure.       <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|\\"Pearl Jam is not Nirvana.  <br />They will never be Nirvana. \\" <br /> <br />A reviewer below writes.. <br /> <br /> <br />Pearl Jam is not Nirvana?... No, they arent.  In fact Pearl Jams worst album is about as good as Nirvanas best.  Pearl Jam isn't Nirvana & will never be Nirvana in the same way the Beatles weren't the Monkees & would never be the Monkees. <br /> <br />Nirvana were Pixies rip-offs who were all too eager to change their sound drastically into something much more commercial on 'Nevermind' & were all too willing to be as corporate as possible while at the same time complaining about corporate music. <br /> <br />If you're over 18 & think Nirvana is better than Pearl Jam... Go to a doctor, because you have serious maturity problems & most likely dont have pubic hair yet. <br /> <br />Nirvana were phony.  Kurt hated fame so much yet stayed in the spotlight until the end... Even after Pearl Jam quit making music videos <br /> <br />Oh yeah, & by the way... Pearl Jams 'Vs' in 1993 literally sold 5x faster than Nirvana's 'In Utero' from the same year... <br /> <br />Not Nirvana? No, they arent.... <br />Pearl Jam is interesting, great, & real - something Nirvana never was. <br /> <br />& this album? Better than any Nirvana album - Buy it.
B000002KHB|5.0|Gave this a listen for the first time in years and was impressed so much that I played it twice. Every song on here kicks ass and the disc flows perfectly. Yes it sounds dated but you don't need the next button on this disc. Musicians that can play their instruments and awesome tunes... \\"Pictures of Home\\" is a highlight. Great solos and something you don't hear in most modern recordings... audible bass guitar. Anyhow, if you like rock and roll this is a must-have.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|When one considers the plight of Jews portrayed on film, nothing compares to Mr. Spielberg's \\"Schindler's List.\\" And though this was a story that needed to be told, I can think of other Spielberg films that were somehow, more rewarding. \\"Jaws\\" \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" \\"E.T.\\" \\"The Color Purple\\" \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and even \\"Amistad.\\"     I can remember quite vividly, the tragic events that destroyed the whole meaning of World Unity, that were supposed to be the 1972 Olympic Games. I was 17, and trying to find meaning to life at the time. But rather than concentrating on the acts of revenge, I would rather have seen more character development, especially of the members of the Israeli Olympic team, and their life stories leading up to Munich. In some ways, I think the fascination with vengeance could be counterproductive to the future peace of Israel. Sad as that may sound. The impact and effect of viewing \\"Munich\\" still rates 4 stars though.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|The best Chili Peppers albums were Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Californication.   Some people like the earliest stuff, but the earlier stuff didn't have the musicianship which really shined through on Blood Sugar Sex Magic.   <br /> <br />The next album, One Hot Minute, was a joke for the most part going along with Dave Navarro who is another joke!  The Chili Peppers said themselves he was more interested in being a rock star than producing good music, which suprises us all because since he has become the epitome of selling his tattoos and image as the ultimate rock star when he doesn't even compare to John or many others on guitar(basically he is a joke musician like Tommy Lee).   <br /> <br /> <br />Anyways, I just wanted to say that others who try and compare this to anything before BSSM should just stop.  The earlier stuff was completely different, and since californication this band took a different turn musically.  <br /> <br />In my opinion Californication was the epitome of this \\"new sound\\" the Chili Peppers have brought with the next releases By the Way and Stadium Arcadium. <br /> <br /> <br />So what do I think of Stadium Arcadium?  It's good because it's the Chili Peppers, but it's definitely not a classic album like they want to sell you.  Dani California is a catchy song, but a catchy song is different then a classic.  BSSM and Californication had classic songs with different and great musicianship.   The Chili's are just trying their best but their sound has definitely lost what they had with BSSM.    <br /> <br />Chili's are still Chili's, which means they are one of the classic bands of all-time.  At the same time it's kind of sickening when people post all this bullcrap about how this is a classic and how people who liked earlier stuff can't understand this new stuff.  Everyone can understand the \\"new sound\\", but it's different Chili Peppers and the earlier sound(BSSM) was better in my opinion(which is unbiased for the most part).  John was playing more inventive guitar, the songs had more room, weird and classic songs were abundant(Sir Psycho Sexy, Breaking the Girl, Funky Monks, Apache Rose Peacock).  You don't find stuff like this on the newer albums.  People say John's guitar has come to the forefront now.  Just listen to BSSM and find out what John's guitar should be doing.  That album was completely inventive and amazing.  One of the greatest albums by any band of all time. <br /> <br />People who say this album has sounds and shades of earlier Chili's, they are basically lying for reasons which I don't know.  This doesn't sound like early Chili's.  I can dig if you like the new sound, but don't say this stuff sounds like the old stuff because it doesn't.  The old fans need to know the truth and so do the new fans.  Buy this album because you like the newer sound and you want something better then By the Way.  Also buy it because you love the Chili Peppers because they are one of the best bands around. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002J03|5.0|Okay, so a new band called \\"Led Zeppelin\\" comes out with a self-titled debut album that takes the world by storm and catapults them into stardom.  It's not the first (or the last) time that's happened.  The true test, in my opinion, comes in the sophomore album.  The truly great bands will continue to mature and progress, while lesser groups simply feed off the success of their debut for several more albums.  Led Zeppelin II proved that Zeppelin was here to stay; not only that, but that they were going to change the face of rock and roll forever.   <br /> <br />The album opens with Jimmy Page's monster guitar on \\"Whole Lotta Love.\\"  Rumor has it Robert Plant did the vocals for this song in one take--that's just how much energy the band had behind it at that point.  The next song, \\"What is and What Should Never Be\\" shows off Plant's immense lyrical talent and the band's ability to groove.  \\"The Lemon Song\\" and \\"Thank You\\" provide a breather in the album, the former being a Robert Johnson-esque bluesy tune (though Page's guitar and Jones's bass shine here) that almost, but doesn't quite deliver, and the latter being (in my opinion) one of Zeppelin's less imaginative love songs.   <br /> <br />If the album tapers off at this point, however, it's only temporary, as the merciless driving of Blues infused with Rock and Roll resumes with \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman).\\"  The former blends nearly seamlessly with the latter, and both are Zeppelin staples in that they showcase the band's remarkable blues-infused rock (or is it rock infused blues?).   <br /> <br />The next song is one of my favorites.  \\"Ramble On\\" is an excellent example of Zeppelin's power of surprise, of their ability to give you what you least expect.  \\"Ramble On\\" has some of the best acoustic guitar I've ever heard.  John Paul Jones's base and John Bonham's drumming blend with this guitar to create a truly beautiful tune.  Add Plant's vocals (this is some of my favorite vocal work) and a mythological lyric of a wanderer seeking love (mixed with the first of several allusions to the Lord of the Rings, mentioning Gollum and a trip through Mordor) and this unique track proves itself to be a classic.  This song is followed by \\"Moby Dick,\\" a track that grooves but is mostly built to showcase Bonham's remarkable drumming ability.  The album concludes with \\"Bring it On Home\\" (complete with harmonica), lest we forget that Zeppelin, after all, is about the blues.  As the bluesy groove builds, however, it soon becomes a veritable barrage of rock as Page explodes with a monster riff and Plant shows off his incredible vocal talent.  To me this song makes a statement:  this is the future of blues.  Get used to it--Zeppelin isn't going anywhere.  If there ever was a preview to a remarkable career, this is it.  At once it is both Zeppelin at its finest and just a hint of the greatness to come, the perfect synthesis of mastery and potential.
B000001F76|5.0|If you're not familiar with Hank Sr. and want a true understanding of American music of the 20th century or hell, of American culture in general for that matter, buy this.This is the man who has influenced country, rockabilly, folk and rock for over 50 years now. Still today it's not hard to find a band somewhere covering these songs.And still there is some young person out there discovering Hank for the first time and being blown away by it. I was. I discovered Hank when I was a teenager in the early 90's, the age of Kurt Cobain, Smashing Pumpkins, etc, and to me he tapped into something that they never could.  Hank is THE classic country singer, but his music transcends time, regions, and all labels and genres. It's simply American music. And very very human.
B0002S947K|5.0|The first song I heard from Ray Lamontagne's debut CD, \\"Trouble\\", found that certain place in my soul where few have traveled. Once inside, it met up with the feelings I have when I listen to anything by James Taylor, vintage Jackson Browne and Van Morrison, among others. It's a calm that will soothe you with a comforting familiarity. A few of these songs were featured on the F/X program, \\"Rescue Me\\", starring Denis Leary, and perfectly portray the struggle inside the main character. <br />
1400079179|5.0|There is little I could add to the glowing reviews for this book, except to say this is a blockbuster for very good reason. It's a masterpiece of fiction, action, suspense and enough PLAUSIBLE truth to make it exciting. Though the bible (as it is in it's heavily edited and distilled version) does not mention Jesus having a wife, it also leaves out 30 years of his short years, as well. There is NO reason he absolutely did NOT have a wife at some point or even children. That is the complaint fundamentalists have with this book... however, having been married does not make the Christ any less the son of God, nor does it somehow dilute his incredible influence on our lives even today. The book is about a more serious matter... that is how many well-meaning Christian's have molded the image of Christ to their own image, instead of wanting to know more about who he REALLY was. I believe no matter how much we discover about the historic Jesus, it should only tend to add to your faith, not take away. That is true faith. This is an awesome work of fiction... but it has inspired MANY to want to know more about Christianity. That should not frighten anyone who loves truth. Could any new knowledge of Christ be a bad thing? If you think so, just wait until you face St. Peter at the gates of heaven!
B000002JSN|5.0|The definintion of a truly great band, in my opinion, is that it is able to constantly reinvent itself.  So many bands with great potential break onto the scene with a crisp new sound, only to fizzle out when that 'new' sound begins to sound tired and labored.  Not so with Zeppelin.  The band was constantly changing and evolving, and this album (to me, at least) is the greatest testament to that.  Physical Graffiti contains a remarkable fusion of the hard rock/blues that made Led Zeppelin famous and a new sound revealing an Eastern influence (both Plant and Page had spent quite a bit of time studying music in the East).   <br /> <br />The result is a great album with some truly breathtaking musical acheivements.  I've always regarded 'Kashmir' as one of the most brilliant rock compositions ever.  The sound and rythym of that remarkable track are absolutely stunning.  While most of the rest of the tracks hold their own, 'Kashmir' alone is worth the price of a double album.  'Houses of the Holy' and 'Trampled Underfoot' are also among my favorite Zeppelin tracks, and both are featured on this album. <br /> <br />Had this album been put out by any other band of the era I believe it would have been an instant classic.  Because it was Led Zeppelin, however, and because the band already had such towering milestones in their past, Physical Graffiti is often overlooked or dismissed as a mediocre effort by the band.  I have to disagree--while the album may not have the overall strength of some of the earlier records, it is still an incredible piece of work.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|R. Scott's director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven is much better than the film we saw in the theater.  The theatrical cut was good, but the film seemed to rush from point A to point B thus hindering any character development.  This director's cut of the film, however, fills in these gaps.  For example, this cut provides a more coherent back story involving Balian and his father, Godfrey.  This addition not only helps the viewer better understand Balian's struggle, but it also explains why a 12th century blacksmith enigmatically appeared to be an ideal Renaissance Man.  In general, if you were disappointed in the theatrical version, I would suggest that you give this cut a try.  It really does feel like a different film.   <br /> <br />
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Yeah, all the instruments sound unreal...even better than the original.  I don't know what Dave did, but everything sounds crisp and clean.  I'm pretty sure he didn't redo the instruments, so all the music is original...except some of the vocals...which comes to my only problem with this album. <br /> <br />Now, granted, I'm very anal about this album because I've listened to it a million times since 1990, and have learned the songs on guitar (even though they take FOREVER to perfect, or even get close), so I immediately noticed that some of the songs had the vocals redone. <br /> <br />The vocals are NOT bad, they're just slightly different than the original, and this sorta drives me nuts when blasting it and singing along, because the slighted variance just throws you off a little.  They're all clean and sung well, just off a little.  Most noticably are the \\"growls\\" like on 'Five Magics'. <br /> <br />But, the way the guitars and bass sound...just totally make up for getting this.  He really mixed it well...but like I said, the vocals sometimes seem \\"out of place\\".  For whatever reason that was done, whether the tracks got lost or whatever, it sucks.  The best song 'Holy Wars', sound like the orignal vocals, so that one got untouched...there might be 1 or 2 others untouched. <br /> <br />
B000FQJAIW|1.0|The 1977 theatrical version of Star Wars in this set, which countless have been waiting years for, is an inferior transfer. It is being made from an old 1993 laserdisc master and it's NOT anamorphic/16x9 enhanced, which is completely unacceptable for a DVD in 2006. I certainly expected better from LucasFilm.
B000002J09|5.0|Zoso (or Led Zeppelin IV) never ceases to amaze me.  This is one of those albums that all bands strive to achieve, yet few do.  In a career full of amazing music this album stands out as Led Zeppelin's masterpiece.  From beginning to end this album rocks with an intensity that is absolutely stunning. <br /> <br />\\"Hey hey mana said the way you move, gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.\\"  Those immortal words of the song `Black Dog', resonating in Robert Plant's passionate voice, open up this epic album.  Jimmy Page joins with a thunderous guitar riff and there's no turning back.  All four men in the band show incredible talent on this album.  Plant's vocals, Page's guitar, John Paul Jones's bass, and John Bonham's drums showcase the talents of the four men, each (in my opinion) among the greatest ever in their respective roles. <br /> <br />Each song is a classic, and each builds upon the last.  `Rock and Roll,' opening as only Bonham can, and `The Battle of Evermore' (which includes a tribute to the Lord of the Rings) will leave you thinking it cannot get any better, and then comes the climax, not only of the album, not only of Led Zeppelin, but perhaps of Rock and Roll, period-the immortal \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"  This song is arguably the greatest rock song ever written, and I believe it deserves the title.  There's nothing more to say-the song is so well known that anyone with a radio has undoubtedly heard it.   <br />After Stairway it seems impossible to not be let down.  And, indeed, no one but Led Zeppelin could even conceivably follow in that song's footsteps.  `Stairway' is indeed the climax, but the album continues to deliver.  `Misty Mountain Hop' (another tribute to JRR Tolkien), `Four Sticks,'`Going to California,' and `When the Levee Breaks' round things out and leave the impression that Rock and Roll will never be the same.    <br /> <br />This is it, the crowning achievement of rock and roll, a classic by any definition of the word.  If you ownone rock album, make it this one.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|As a long time APP fan, I was pleasantly surprised by this new offering.  Like many others who left negative reviews, I was underwhelmed when I first listened to the album, but, as is usually the case with Parsons' music, the more you listen to it, the more it grows on you.  The instrumentals are outstanding, as they always are, and the vocal tracks seem weak at first, but reveal their complexity with repeated listens.  For those of you who dissed this CD, give it a few more tries...I promise you that it will pay off in the long run!
B0007ZIYM4|3.0|Janine Jansen is a young Hollander that's making a name for herself beyond the shores of her native land. This CD of Vivaldi's chestnut, \\"Four Seasons\\", is helping build her international reputation.<br /><br />Jansen is a young woman that plays a 1727 Stradivarius and that fact alone has set a lot of musicologists atwitter. She plays with a senstivity and syle in keeping with the way performers do the \\"Four Seasons\\" today. Jansen is abetted here by a band of seven -- two violins, viola, cello, double bass, theorbo and either harpsichord of box organ (played by one Jan Jansen, probably a relative but not identified in the notes or at Ms. Jansen's Web site.) This octet performance eschewing the full string band also set some critics atwitter.<br /><br />Musically, these performances are warm, virtuosic and mainstream with a few touches that show the players and soloist have something to say about the music. Note Janine's free use of rubato in the opening of \\"Spring\\" and her free portamento in its second movement. Right away the listener knows this group has an idea about the music. Janine closes \\"Spring\\" with phrasing beginning with sforzando and going from PP to FF in a matter of notes or bars. Her tendency to close movements quietly and peacefully begins here, also.<br /><br />From the beginning the soloist and group are aided by a recorded  sound that is deep, clear and natural with orchestral depth and definition. This is DDD but not SACD although it sounds close to the latter.<br /><br />While the first two were also well done, I thought the closing pair of concertos were the better ones on the CD. \\"Autumn\\" has a notable stream of consciousness approach in its adagio molto with the solo violin and harpsichord obligato sharing the spotlight. The concluding \\"Winter\\" concerto begins high exqiusite techinque by the soloist and fury from everyone. Its following largo is a lot like a Mravinsky largo (more like allegro) and the concluding allegro offers an exhibition of counterpoint between the soloist and cellist. Again, each concerto concludes quietly and peacefully.<br /><br />Musically, I thought this performance was interesting and it is certainly well-recorded. However, since that performance way back when by steel-fingered I Musici, the bar has been set impossibly high on recordings of this music. Anything that's going to come along in 2006 and compete must have a great deal going for it musically, must have some extramusical interest, and, perhaps most important, must have something on the recording to keep us interested beyong the warhourse quartet of concertos.<br /><br />While the musical values of this recording are good and the recording is exceptional, it fails to meet any of the other criteria. Any full price CD in the new century (this one has a list price of $18 even though BMG is marketing it for $14) must have more than the puny 40 minutes here dedicated to the \\"Four Seasons.\\" With a capacity for 80 minutes on a CD, London has left half the loaf unbaked but is asking you to pay for the whole thing.<br /><br />Extramusically, this recording has little else going for it. The notes are not enthralling. They don't tell you how old is Ms. Jansen or whom is Jan Jansen. You get three paragraphs about the music and a half-dozen artful gold-laced photos of the soloist with not a single word about any of the other performers.<br /><br />I think this CD is probably directed to crossover listeners with money to burn and no interest in any of these things. It is good musicmaking inside but otherwise doesn't hold much interest for serious collectors or those that want to know more about this warhorse set of concertos or the players. A nice notch in the bedpost, then, for Ms. Jansen but nothing special otherwise.<br /><br />2010 update: the Janine Jansen fan club registered dismay about my review in the comments. Four years down the line and discounted from its original $19 list price, this recording isn't terrilbe value forthe $8 or $9 you can now purchase it used through Amazon vendors. But, with short playing time and little more than a nice recording of the Four Seasons -- of which Arkiv Music now lists a staggering 239 recordings available, many of which are linked to more and better music for less than you'd pay for this used -- I still wonder what makes this recording in any way special.ith short playing time and little more than a nice recording of the Four Seasons -- of which Arkiv Music now lists a staggering 239 recordings available, many of which are linked to more and better music for less than you'd pay for this used -- I still wonder what makes this recording in any way special.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|Shaun of the Dead is a must-see for lovers of gory comedy. It has a well-thought out, and well proportioned mix of laughs, gore, and drama. Whereas in other zombie flicks you are solely waiting to see if the main characters are going to survive, in Shaun of the Dead you are also impelled to see whether or not Shaun and Liz get back together, and whether Shaun will make good with his step-father. The dialogue is witty and the plot is well-conceived. You will laugh. You will probably be like me and play certain parts over and over just to laugh some more. You will be compelled to feel sad. You just also may get a little frightened. Few movies can withdraw these three emotions, and Shaun of the Dead does so brilliantly.  <br /> <br />This movie didn't do so well in the theatres for whatever reason, but has achieved a cult following since coming out on DVD. Make this your next rental or purchase.
B000069HZP|5.0|When a successful in the middle of his brilliant and winning profession loses his focus, his brother Sean Penn decides by himself to prepare an inoffensive game, the perfect gate for his tribulations and wishes of evasion, adventure and mystery.<br /><br />You may certain rules of a game but that does not mean, you necessarily must have all the answers and maintain the emotional equilibrium.<br /><br />A delirious and fascinating picture that - at least to my mind - deserved to David Fincher (Seven and The fight club)an emblematic status among the most creative and original filmmakers of his generation, considering all these three films have acquired cult status.<br /><br />A superb cast, a solid script and kinetic cinematography make of this work one of my twenty Top American movies along the Nineties.
B000059T1E|5.0|In many respects, this is the first \\"true\\" Traffic album.  It began as a solo Steve Winwood effort; Chris Wood and Jim Capaldi were brought in mid-way to lend support.  This was always the Traffic paradigm, Winwood was the genius, the creative center, and all other participants were collaborators.  Somebody somewhere started the crazy rumor that Dave Mason, participant on Traffic's first three albums, was working on a peer level with Winwood - which is rather like saying that Ringo was working on a peer level with John Lennon.  Barleycorn is the first post-Mason Traffic effort, and as such, shows just how much his cutesy coffee-house folkiness prevented Winwood from taking the group where it was inevitably headed - into jazzy, R&B, blue-eyed English rock & soul.<br /><br />From the opening bars of Glad, a track that carries you jubilantly for 7:00, it's clear that this is a very different Traffic.  Winwood's keyboard playing on Glad is as tasty as anything he's ever done.  From there it's on to Freedom Rider, which picks up the pace and intensity, great writing and singing.  With Empty pages comes a tough, deliberate funk - excellent drumming and Winwood singing right out of his head.  (Unlike the original album, this CD then mysteriously includes a bit of litter called I Just Want You To Know - a dumb mistake.)  By the time you hit Stranger To Himself you're down so deep in a funky groove that England is the last thing on your mind, Detroit in summertime would be more like it.<br /><br />Then comes the anomaly.  The title track, now something of an institution, is completely out of place.  It's lovely and memorable, but feels like an uninvited guest at a party.  The original closer, Every Mother's Son, delivers the trademark anthem quality of many Winwood compositions, haunting singing, yearning, reaching.  This CD then provides another bit of litter, Sittin' Here Thinkin' Of My Love, which Winwood had composed for the original album.  Cooler heads prevailed back then, and you can choose to pretend it doesn't exist.  Chris Wood really shines on this album, on flute and sax, it is surely one of his most lucid performances.  Capaldi is perfect on drums and should have left well enough alone, his attempted transformation into rock star singer was embarrassing.  But in the final analysis, of course, this is the vehicle where every aspect of Winwood's genius is allowed to dazzle; writing, singing, keyboards, guitar, he does everything well.  Were you to own only one Traffic CD it would be a coin toss between this and Low Spark.an choose to pretend it doesn't exist.

0060736267|5.0|Some books that are hailed as \\"classics\\" are very much a product of their own time and seem confounding and dated to modern readers. Betty Smith's 1940 novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn isn't one of those books.. It touches on timeless topics like family ties, loss, and poverty, making it accessible to a large number of readers. It also helps that the characters are endearing, and above all, honest. Everyone has their flaws, and some are even self-destructive, but none are unlikable. None of the characters are sugarcoated in the least, and feel like real people with very real problems.  <br /> <br />The story of this novel revolves around the Nolan family, and in particular Francie. The family includes a mother, Katie; a father, Johnny; and a son, Neeley, in addition to Francie. As the title indicates, they live in Brooklyn, in a typical immigrant tenement building. The Nolan family is staggeringly poor, along with all the other families that live around them. Their poverty is evident in the first few pages when Francie and Neeley go around collecting junk with all of the other neighborhood children for a few cents. Even this meager amount of money is split in half so that part of it can be placed in a bank on a closet door in the apartment in Katie's hopes that someday the money can be used to buy a little land. Katie is a janitor in the apartment buildings and is still pretty despite the toll of years of hard work. Johnny Nolan is an alcoholic, but is still charming and loving to his family despite this. His small pay as a singing waiter, alas, is not enough to feed his family. The book starts out when Francie is a preteen and gets to where she is in her late teens. In that time, the family has to deal with hard times, has had some small triumphs, and Johnny's alcoholism is a fact that can no longer be denied. The children all lose their innocence pretty quickly as living in poverty is a fact of life that has to be dealt with, as they find out.  <br /> <br />I guessyou could say that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is largely plotless and doesn't follow the conventions of any type of genre literature, and you would basically be right, but a lot does happen in the book. Basically, the plot of the book is life itself, with no convenient twists or last-minute saves. What happens, happens--and none of the characters can change that fact. That makes the book seem too bleak, though; while it is never explicitly \\"happy\\" (how can you ever be truly happy when you sometimes don't even have enough food?) it never loses that glowing feeling of hope. Enormous sympathy goes to the main characters, who seem like hard-working, honest, good people who seem to deserve more in life than what they've got. Even Johnny's alcoholism is easy to understand, though of course not condoned. When he begins to spin further into the abyss of self-destruction, you don't think \\"well, that's what happens\\" or \\"Good riddance\\" but rather sadness for him, and for his family, because he is so likable. This feeling of hope does occasionally dim because of various things that happen, but you never stop hoping for the best.  <br /> <br />Betty Smith's writing style is thoughtful, and meditative, and occasionally even witty. She also has a commanding use of metaphors that is impressive. Her no-frills, but  <br />still expressive, writing carries the reader through the nearly 500 pages with ease, and while the story naturally lags occasionally, it is never \\"boring,\\" just slow sometimes. She also stops from the main story into flashbacks that recall how Katie and Johnny have previously spent their lives, and she also fully fleshes out the many fascinating supporting characters, who get their own back stories. The most interest supporting character is Katie's sister Sissy, who is regarded as some kind of cheap floozy who sleeps around who is hopelessly in love with children despite the fact that she has miscarried over ten children. Her story is heartbreaking, but ultimately bittersweet by the end. Francie is always the anchor of the novel, though. Sometimes headstrong, sometimes weak-willed, she experiences a lot of life for her young years by the end of the book.  <br /> <br />I would recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn to anyone looking for a good coming-of-age story that is always interesting to read with fully developed characters.  <br />
0307277674|5.0|Any idiot out there writing an angry, negative review about this book is crazy. This book, although not for the most enlightened reader, is great entertainment. For someone looking for a way to entertain themselves, and maybe looking for a reason to google some famous art works, this book is for you. Its fun, exciting, and an easy read. So spend the one night it will take you and read this book even if its just to join the discussion that all your friends have been having for years.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Californication was excellent... By The Way topped it... Now Stadium Arcadium has exceeded both.  The band has matured musically and Anthony's vocals have never been better.  The bass is the best they have ever written and Flea is right on.   <br /> <br />This album takes you from the raw tunes reminiscent of Blood Sugar Sex Magic to harmonious ballad blends similar to Californication and By The Way.  In short, it offers EVERYTHING. <br /> <br />Worth every penny.  Many, many, many hours of enjoyment.  By the third listen you will be singing along, by the forth you will be playing air guitar.    <br />
