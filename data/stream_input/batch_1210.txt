B0056BMK6K|4.0|I am an avid reader.  Never in my life have I read such a hilarious yet informing book!  I guess that spoon full of sugar ~ does make the medicine go down.  He's good at \\"breaking things down\\", yet does not take himself too seriously. LOVE THAT!  He gets to the point and although he makes you laugh and smile-he doesn't blah, blah, blah you to death.

B00139XTG4|4.0|Four (4) years have passed since I read the first edition, so I was excited to read it for a second time with the added section.  As most movie goers have from experience, most sequels are o.k., but rarely better. In the case of \\"The Black Swan\\", I can strongly state, as others have, that Mr. Taleb pulled the rabbit and bettered his earlier \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" which was already a great book on uncertainty and failures of Gaussian (i.e. Bell Curve) probabilities as an application.<br /><br />Though the Bell Curve can explain many activities that are in relative equilibrium, it does not fit well with real day-to-day observations like the weather, markets, wealth distribution, bacteria growth, and etceteras. That is because we live in a world that is getting more complex and more \\"recursive\\" (i.e. contains feedback loops) every day. As the recursiveness gets more intertwined in society, the power laws tend to place us in the critical state which is a prime and fruitful place for Mr. Teleb's Black Swans. The fruitful place discussed is in Extremistan or the the 'fourth quadrant', and is far away from the Gaussian place that many (if not all) of us have been taught for much of our lives. Within Extremistan, thought models of 4,5, or 6 sigma events are not applicable and lead one into a false sense of security.<br /><br />In a world in which our evolutionary machinery has made us gullible to many topics with such as examples of, anchoring, narrative fallacy, confirmation errors, envy, and combinational probabilities (as well as many others), knowing that we don't know what we don't know is a start in the search (and protection) from Black Swans. Or what some call the unknown - unknowns.  If you liked the 1st book, you should love the sequel as a more critical narrative will keep you entertained for hours and hopefully better prepare you for a more recursive society that we appear destined for.<br /><br />Other works the reader my be interested in:<br />[[ASIN:1400067936 Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets]]  by Nassim Nicholas Taleb<br />[[ASIN:B002UGU3CC Deep Simplicity: Chaos, Complexity and the Emergence of Life]]  by John Gribbin<br />[[ASIN:0465043577 The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence]]  by Benoit MandelbrotHidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets]]  by Nassim Nicholas Taleb  [[ASIN:B002UGU3CC Deep Simplicity: Chaos, Complexity and the Emergence of Life]]  by John Gribbin  [[ASIN:0465043577 The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence]]  by Benoit Mandelbrot

B003X5UDEW|5.0|Absolutely amazing movie--not just martial arts movie. No high flying, attacked to a string craprobatics, but an amazing and true story about a man who upholds the dignity of humanity while preserving the martial arts that we love. Very inspiring--full of great action--and a heart tug.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Well made, useful, effective sharpener from a Arkansas company. Not made in the USA unfortunately.  Well received as a table favor at a Ducks Unlimited event.
B0018OAPAW|2.0|I don't really know why, but something keeps me from liking this record. It's one of those times where no matter how many times I listen to it, I still only remember about five or six songs.<br /><br />I know what you might be thinking: \\"Well, you have to give it time.\\"<br /><br />It's now been more than three years. I still listen to it at least once a month, and I still don't remember more than a few songs from it afterwards. It sounds good whenever I play it, but when it stops, I forget what songs are on it. That's not the sign of a good record to me. And it's not that I haven't tried liking it, I want to like it, because I love The Offspring, but it just won't let go. I'm trying and trying, but it just won't resonate with me. I'm sorry.<br /><br />There are some good songs here, like the heavy riffs of \\"Hammerhead\\" and \\"Half-Truism\\", the dancefest of \\"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\\", the sad, ballad-like \\"Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?\\" and the hilarious, but still important \\"Stuff Is Messed Up\\".<br /><br />I either love or like all of these songs, but those are the only ones I really remember after each listen. The rest fail to make a lasting impression; and even if the ones that I like are pretty good, they're not on par with any of the bands other good songs (with the exception of \\"Hammerhead\\"). Even the most turgid and numbing tracks on \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" are more memorable than the album tracks on \\"Rise and Fall\\".<br /><br />It reminds me of that old question: \\"Do you really have to love everything by an artist in order to be a fan?\\"<br /><br />If the answer is yes, then I'm not a fan of The Offspring. If it's no, then I'm a fan. I just don't like this particular album. Everybody has the right to have their own opinion, and it's not a terrible album, it's just not an album for me.
0385534639|4.0|I'm not a fan of circuses so I wasn't expecting too much with this book. However, it turned out to be a wonderful fantasy. It is a love story, yet that tends to be in the background for most of the book. And as much as I like love stories, in this novel the other characters took on such importance that it turned out to be a love story on many levels; a tale of how much people were enchanted with this exotic event. The best part of the book for me was it brought back a hint of the excitement you used to feel waking up on a summer day as a child, that it was full of possibilities. I found it hard to put down and would like to read more by this author.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|very satisfied with this product. came exactly as described and in a timely fashion. ordered as like new and it came with the plastic still on it
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book. The writing is extremely creative. Most times dialogues of animals in books come off cartoon like, but not in Racing. You never forget Enzo is a dog, but at same time you feel he's more than a dog. I'm almost afraid to read another book by Mr. Stein for fear my expectations are set too high. I actually shared some quotes from Enzo recently for friends with a family pet that had passed on.
B0041D843M|5.0|I had read the books by Drs. Esselstyn and Ornish and was very impressed by their investigations, research, and studies regarding how a stricly plant food diet (no foods with a face or a mother) can prevent and even reverse heart disease as well as other major diseases.  Their books peaked my interest enough that I bought The China Study and this will be the book that will enable you to make a final decision in what changes-if any-you want to make in your current nutrition program.    If you or someone you know has a heart problem or diseases commonly linked with heart disease, you just may want to include this book on your next purchase for books.  I got the Kindle format and recommended The China Study along with the books by Drs. Esselstyn and Ornish to a family member and they purchased all three paper back formats because the husband was told by his team of doctors,  \\"there was nothing more they could do for him\\" which translates into go home and get your things in order and enjoy the time you have left.
0307454541|2.0|I had heard so much about this book, that I felt I had to read it. The story line and the twists were very clever and well thought out. But it was just too edgy for me. Some of the sexual and brutal content made it an unenjoyable read.

B001992NUQ|4.0|'Fight Club' is the outspoken poster-child of a time when movie makers that are my age/generation started to peak in the industry and put their personalized stamp on films.  A time when the economy allowed for investors to front money for the production of more risky pictures as opposed to sticking with the conservative 'plastic coated'...'popcorn' garbage that has been produced in the past few years.    For a movie that attacks a value system that is partially reasponsible for its production is the sweet irony that made me reflect upon myself when the timing was absolutely perfect.    Fight Club is a perfect addition to your Blu-ray collection.  Very reasonably priced.  This movie is a man-cave must.    I you liked 'Fight Club' try 'Momento'.
1599218011|5.0|Kris Carr lights up with sunshine..she is so pretty inside and out. I saw her on Oprah years ago and thought ..I want that glowing and calm presence too. I have read a few of her books and incorporate her suggestions here and there. I have made the green drink (my hubbie calls it swamp juice) and use almond milk instead of milk.  I dropped coffee. I thought CSD was a great read and a keeper as there are lots of recipes in the book worth keeping......
B00003CXPD|5.0|Be Inspired.  Laugh, Cheer...Wipe a Tear - It's Here!  It is one of those movies that has it all...but delivered in a refreshing foreign indie format that is not the spoon feed,predictable and forced feel-good Hollywood delivery (i.e., 'The Blind Side'...'Erin Brockovich').    I you like this movie, check out 'Saint Ralph'..the 4 star sibling of this 5 star classic.
B004EPZ0A2|1.0|I saw this movie tonight, and at first it seemed okay but then it got real boring, it is badly written and poorly acted out, there was no excitement or suspense in this movie, it is just pure bland...I'm not going to say anymore then that, but there are better older movies out there like The Cassandra Crossing.  This is just my opinion, you on the other hand might like contagion, to me it was a total waste of 2 hours. This movie is more suited towards a made for television kind of film, thank you!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I'm not a 'Trekkie' but a good Sci-Fi action movie is a good Sci-Fi Action Movie.  I have seen most of the old Star Trek movies (unfortunately including the first one) and probably most of the original episodes.  This movie launches the new series of movies at warp speed into the coolness galaxy.      The characters are same as the original crew (i.e. Spock, Kirk)...but more protrayed as the 'cool kids'.  It works and this movie is total fun and great in Blu-ray format.  My sister-in-law and girlfriend both saw this movie in the theaters without seeing any of the orginal shows or old Trek movies.  They both loved the movie.    The Movie that has made Chris Pine a star was my favorite movie of 2009 which was refreshing as 09 was a poor year for movies.
B0051DSAP8|4.0|Well, people insist up and down that \\"Blood of the Saints\\" is just a rehashing of Powerwolf's earlier albums, but as I'd only heard a handful of songs from \\"Bible of the Beast\\" and \\"Lupus Dei,\\" I really can't confirm that.    In any case, wow. I love some catchy power metal, and Powerwolf has fed me just that. I knew I was going to enjoy this album when I heard the early sample track \\"Sanctified With Dynamite,\\" and I was certainly correct. Simplistic and repetitive though the album may seem to long-time Powerwolf fans, I can't help but crank the volume when one of these tracks comes up on my shuffle.    Of course, it doesn't hurt that I have a guilty love of werewolves and vampires that Powerwolf consistently feeds me with just about every album they put out, this one included: \\"Song of a Wolf,\\" \\"Night of the Werewolves,\\" \\"We Drink Your Blood,\\" \\"All We Need is Blood...\\"    Now I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is a perfect album, because as with all albums, there were some tracks I could simply never make myself like. \\"Murder at Midnight,\\" for example, is definitely low on my list of favorites, as is \\"Ira Sancti\\" and, despite my love of werewolves, \\"Night of the Werewolves.\\"    All in all, it's a good, solid power metal album with werewolves and vampires, and a pinch of tongue-in-cheek blasphemy thrown in there - exactly what I paid to get. I'm perfectly happy with my purchase.    Highs: \\"Sanctified With Dynamite,\\" \\"We Drink Your Blood,\\" \\"Son of a Wolf\\"  Lows: \\"Murder at Midnight,\\" \\"Ira Sancti,\\" \\"Night of the Werewolves\\"
B002T9H2ME|4.0|I am a Sci-Fi movie fan.  I also like indie flicks and a creative non-recycled storyline.  'Moon' checks all of those boxes.      Sam Rockwell (Charlie's Angels [movie], Matchstick Men) delivers his best performance to date.     If you liked 'Moon' try 'Cube' or '2001 Space Odessy'...avoid 'Saturn 3'
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Wow...talk about a fantastic mega collection of Bee Gees hits!  I have not been able to stop listening to this two disc set since it arrived.  Disc one is a high energy compilation of primarily the later hits.  Its a party to go!  You can't help wanting to get up and move to it, or sing along...especially if you listened to this music as it was released during the 70's - 90's.  Nice addition of \\"This Is Where I Came In\\" towards the end, a killer track, to bring the group up to their last release in 2001, as well as a great live version of \\"Spicks and Specks\\", one of their first hits in the 60's.  Disc two features the earlier material, the soulful ballads, and also includes three live tracks of songs written for others (all hits in their own right).  It is a mellow, beautiful, romantic disc...again you can't help but sing along!  The writing, the harmonies, the energy, the masterful skill of words and music of The Bee Gees...its all here.  This is top quality performance and production...buy this!
B000002KIE|5.0|It may not be the best punk rock album ever (I am not a hardcore 'punker' and would not fare well in such a debate) but it is the KING.  This is the album...along with it timeless track/song 'God Save the Queen' that introduced more people to punk rock than any other.  I wore out 2 cassette 'Bollocks' in the 80s and know every lyric.  Sid truely does live.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Don't buy the movie until they have the digital codes for download.  We are moving into the new era of tablets without DVD's.  Come on George, give us a break!!!
B002ZG9846|5.0|Kick Ass...well, Kicked Ass.  The movie that is...not the character.    The movie was absolutely fun even though I was out of the targeted age range.  There are certain things that would make the wave of neverending superhero movies cooler to the target teen audience, but these same things would stamp those movies with a money-hurdle 'R' rating....this movie has those things.    Nick Cage finally got back to being kinda cool...He returned with flashes of coolness in 'Matchstick Men' but got lost again in a 'Michael Bay taught me how to kill money' fog before returning heroically in 'Kick-Ass'.    If you have a son, friend or nephew in high school, this movie is a sure fire hit as a gift.  Actually, they probably already downloaded an illegal copy by now so scratch that...just give them the 20 bucks.    If you like 'Kick-Ass' then try 'Superbad' but avoid 'The Last Airbender'
B004CIIXFA|4.0|\\"I make films to prove that we are not living in the best of possible worlds\\"<br />(Luis Bu&ntilde;uel)<br /><br />Andrea Arnold made a couaregous and even challenging film respect the  hopelessness projects of a voiceless youth who intends to search a beacon in the dark to give meaning to their lives.<br /><br />A mother -dismissed about the world and inmersed in an eternal mist of alcohol and frivolity- and her two daughters. The eldest (Katie Jarvis) prone to break all the rules, fighting against everything she considers deprived of freedom (The obsessive idea of freeing the mare) endowed with a marvelous quality - dance spirit - willing to prove the whole world she has talent to spare and even more to tantalize her lover's mother , carves in relief a desoltae scene in the heart of a soulless city.<br /><br />The finale sequence would seem to send us to that escape to anywhere of The four hundred blows' protagonist.<br /><br />Touching, disturbing, taering and compelling film that must be seen.
B002WY65W4|5.0|The best Horror-Comedy-Zombie flick since 1985s 'Return of The Living Dead'.<br /><br />It took almost a quarter of a century to match the quality level of the cult classic which spawned the \\"BRAINS\\" searching zombies that have been spoofed on 'The Simpsons' and other outlets....but it was worth the wait.  In a lackluster year of movies, 2009s ZOMBIELAND was a breath of decomposing air that uncannily tasted artificially sweet...like 'Twinkies'.<br /><br />I keep my movie stub to place inside the cover of my Blu-Ray disc which I promptly purchased before its' release date.<br /><br />The best Movies to own are the ones that you can watch over and over...Zombieland is just that.
B00178JDCK|2.0|Some things are great values, others are cheap. The Behringer is cheap. The clips are cheap. The clip that holds the 9V broke after the first change. The clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic. IF you get stuck using batteries, plan on 3-4 hours worth of use. It's also a noisy pedal. Like noisier than my Dyna Comp and OD pedals combined. Like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise. If you leave it plugged into your cables, even when powered down, it will eat your batteries.     All of those negatives aside, you are paying less than $40 for a Reverb pedal that has several usable features. The 63' spring is great, the plate is also really good. It also has a worth-the-price-alone \\"space\\" feature. Also known as shimmer (a synth playing behind your instrument). Paired with a chorus effect, you can get some really cool tones.     The RV600 is not without merit, but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features. If you gig or record and need a reverb...well...you aren't even looking at this pedal. If you play at home and have a low watt amp that doesn't have a reverb built in, this is a good option.
B00275EGX8|4.0|Audie Murphy has no place in the Locker, except for its unfitting end.  The bomb disposal niche coupled with the personal feel created by the indie origin of this movie help separate it from the many 'hero story'...'political statement generated tragedy'...and 'go America' war flicks in existence.        The ending of this movie seems like it has a behind the scenes story involving studio executives, timing, and the makers selling options proposed to studios/distributors.  The ending could have been so much more and it actually does not fit in with some of the body of the picture.  To try and put a rah rah...support our troops ending on a movie that spent over an hour creating a totally different feel was awkward.  Even the music in the last minute did not fit.  The last time I watched this movie I stopped it before the last few scenes/45-60 seconds and it was much improved.    This is a good movie, but not `Best Picture good'.  It won Best Picture because of luck.  It was released in the worst year for movies in my lifetime.  If you want a `Best Picture Good' war movie, just watch `Platoon'.  Even though Hurt Locker is over-rated, it is a cool movie and I obviously chose to add this Blu-ray to my collection.    If you like `Hurt Locker' try `Children of Men'.

0783231202|5.0|This movie has fallen off the radar as \\"generation text\\" has influenced hollywood to produce the CGI 3-D wave of forgettable fluff that has come out.  Such a good movie that is now over a decade old.  People have forgotten that Steven Spielberg directed this movie...not just produced.  Music by John Williams...well acted by an all star cast.  This movie will stir your emotions while increasing the 'quality' of your dvd collection at the same time.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Essential reading for anyone who has ever asked the question \\"From where did I come?\\"  I would like to see Mr. Dawkins esq. develop a series of child guides that could be comprehended by all post-embryonic children through to the level of maturity at which they could fully grasp the information he so eloquently imparts.  I am neither a blinkered 'Creationist' nor 'Evolutionist'.  I believe in 'Creation' of the Universe. I do not believe it was always there. I believe it emerged as a result of an evolutionary process of extra-universal forces that are currently beyond our comprehension.I generally support the Big Bang theory although I am more inclined to believe it was a process similar to crystallisation, occasioned by energy slowing down to < the speed of light, rather than an explosion as the term 'Big Bang' implies.  If I were God with omnipotent power I would find it extremely boring to wave a magic wand six times in order to create my Universe in a week. It would be much more fun to throw the Creation dice and then sit back in an easy chair for 18 billion years or so and watch the fun that evolution brings to the party.  It is only humankind that has contrived to sit on opposite sides of the house (as it does about virtually everything) over the Creation/Evolution topic. The rest of nature seems to be able to get on with 'being' in a far less confrontational way.  P.S. Not only did Sherlock Holmes not utter the words \\"Elementary, my dear Watson\\" but there is also no evidence that he wore a deer-stalker hat or smoked a curly pipe.

B004UXUSIM|5.0|Midnight in Paris:     Future father-in-law and mother-in-law on business trip to Paris take daughter and her Hollywood film writer fiance along.  She wouldn't want to live anywhere but in the US.  He's lived in Paris and wishes he never left.  She likes to shop and museum and dance; he likes to walk in the rainy Paris night.  Overall theme is that many long for and have a nostalgia for the past and seek it as an escape from the present.  The movie involves visiting Paris in the 1920's and in La Belle Epoque and meeting a wonderful set of characters and scenes from the past.  Wonderful cameo roles and vignettes.

0896898288|2.0|I purchased this book very excited to make the quilt for my grandmother, a true Farmer's Wife.  I printed out all the templates despite the waste of paper only to find out that the measurements are not accurate.  The blooks come out the wrong size unless you do the math for each and every block and adjust the template accordingly.  I think the editor forgot to have a quilt made from the templates to make sure they actually work.  That being said, it was a quick fun read.

B002V091IO|4.0|This is a tremendously good read. I think you have to be at least 30+ to really appreciate the profound melancholy that runs through all of its pages. The book is really well written and it is never boring as Nicholls almost always makes you want to read on, with the notable exception of the very last chapter maybe, which I personally found a bit long-winded. (Just as this sentence is.) The only other thing one could moan about, is that Nicholls' portrayal of a seven-year-old child asking for detailed swimming pool opening times seems, at least to me, slightly unconvincing, but having said that it is still a very good book that I can recommend.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|All I wanted was to see the best quality picture and sound for these movies. But what we will get is changes to the original and subpar Blu-ray disc quality. I want to watch this movie with my son and daughter as it was when I was 7 years old. I guess I'll have to wait until they release another version which contains the original theatrical versions. What a disappointment.
0670022411|4.0|This books starts off a little slow, but keep reading!  It picks up and the details that I felt made it slow in the beginning turn out to be essential to the story line.  The second half, especially, I found myself absorbed in and couldn't put the book down.  This is a great read and I cannot wait to dig into the next book of the series!
B002NEFL8W|4.0|I really like the battery grip, it really extends picture taking time when using the Live View feature of the Canon 7D.

1451629184|4.0|Anyone else getting \\"If I Die Young\\" vibes here?<br /><br />Now, on a more serious note, the subject of kidnappings has driven me wild all my life. When I was a youngster (and I still am, but I mean when I was a young youngster), kidnappings were the stuff of nightmares for me. In kindergarten, I had a dream I was in class at a party at night, and when I went out into the hallway alone, the beast from Beauty and the Beast put me in a big black bag and carried me away into the night. I peed the bed that night and went into my dad's bed crying.<br /><br />Yeah. Kidnappings and I have a long (and indirect) history with each other. So, imagine my inevitable surprise when I'm surfing Goodreads one day and I find out that the eighteen-year-span kidnapping survivor had written a book. I knew nothing else of the world but the fact that I needed to read this book at some point in my life. This book would benefit me more than food after a three-day fast (which I've never participated in, by the way), not just to inform me more about what Jaycee went through but about how I need to get over my fears and come to terms with them.<br /><br />This book did just that, and while it may not have the best writing I've ever read (actually, far from it) or the best structure (again, far from it), this book helped me to overcome something that kept me up at night. It helped me realize that stranger kidnappings are really rare, and if I were the target of one, I could escape. It's helped me become more secure in myself as a person and overcome my fears.<br /><br />Hearing little tapping noises in the middle of the night would set my heart on full-panic mode, and I'd lie awake for hours thinking it was someone tapping a creepy, grimy fingernail on my window, peering in, waiting for me to come to them and let them take me away. In all reality, it might've been a mouse running through the walls, but I'd instantly set my mind on the worst and believe it to be true.<br /><br />A STOLEN LIFE may not be the best book out there quality-wise, but if you're like me, it may help you overcome a challenge in life.ality-wise, but if you're like me, it may help you overcome a challenge in life.

Also you need wi-fi after all that you can read a book. Save the time and just buy the book or really lose your mind a go to a used book store and buy any book you want for around a dollar and finally don't even consider calling tech support they are useless.
B0000524CY|5.0|Throughout my life, I've watched numerous Horror Movies. IMO, The Exorcist is still the spookiest ever. I believe it has more meaning/impact to those whom were raised and/or are religious.     There are newer movies made today attempting to parrot The Exorcist, but none come close. Although some are worth viewing.     When The Exorcist, 'version you've never seen' was shown in the theaters, my sister, brothers, in-laws and I went to see it.   11 extra minutes..A spam? Especially to those who paid to see the original, cut version, purchased the VHS & DVD.      Anyway, for those whom never seen The Exorcist and love a well-made horror movie, I suggest buying a copy.     Turn out the lights, 'watch on a stormy night, if possible,' sit back and enjoy this great movie. You will be frightened.     The Exorcist was made prior to high-technology. They literally 'worked' their butts off setting the haunting, devilish mood of this film. Example: In one scene, the room is supposed to be icy cold. They brought in 'X' amount of ice. The room was really cold. Steam emitted from characters mouths, making it genuine.       After seeing The Exorcist the first time, 'at the show,' it took a week or longer before I had a decent night sleep.  Also, priests were receiving daily calls from people who believed they or their children were possessed. lol. Toni

0380973839|5.0|I first read this book back when it was still called \\"The Silver Locusts\\". A set of short stories about Martians - a story form of which Ray Bradbury is a master.     This is science fiction at its best. Interesting, profound, appealing to all ages and timeless.
B00136JQOG|5.0|Wow, can't believe its been so long. Love this album and always have. I saw her in concert in Berkeley in the 80's.     Although \\"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\\" was the big hit on this album, several of the others songs got playing time. Even the ones that were not as popular were really good.    Check out \\"Money Changes Everything\\" as well as \\"She Bop.\\" \\"When You Were Mine\\" was written by Prince and he also has a version you can find on YouTube.    \\"Time After Time\\" is also a nice song but the favorite on this album is \\"All Through The Night\\" which I really enjoy. It's a great song to listen to when you want to think about the mistakes that you made in the past, including relationships that may have ended or ended but not on your terms.    Great album and certainly worth the price of $3.99    Enjoy this music folks, they don't make music like this anymore.

1595825045|5.0|If you are an Avatar fan, you are going to love this book. Maybe, just maybe, the only bad thing is that you'll want more and more. I wish they could make another book with more art.<br /><br />This book is filled with early concepts, artwork and final concepts of the characters of Avatar. It also has a lot of information and stories about the production of the series, anecdotes and other notes about the characters. The very special thing is that these notes come directly from Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino (creators of the series, but you probably already knew that).<br /><br />Just get the book, I don't think anyone would regret it.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am a fully functional, capable, well adjusted adult with a well paying job, family, friends, hobbies and interests in the world outside of Star Wars. It is amazing that people are still spouting off \\"Get a life!\\" when it comes to fans voicing their concerns over something they love being treated with such disdain by it's own creator. What \\"Get a life!\\" really means when someone says it is \\"i'm better than you, my beliefs and values on what is important are more important than yours, please stop talking because I can't stand it when someone doesn't agree with me.\\" Please. It's unoriginal, lame and lazy.    Now, on to this set. I will not be buying this. It has already been well documented by people that ACTUALLY HAVE THIS SET (sorry, had to capitalize to make sure it was read by the ADD generation) that it is a poor release. Extra material aside, pretty much all the \\"technical corrections\\" Lucasfilm did were to select shots. The color timing is STILL incorrect from the 2004 dvd release. Not to mention the Vader \\"nooo\\", Greedo shooting first, Krayt Dragon call sounding like some guy getting his testicles smashed with a hammer, etc. And to the crux of 99% of the outcry, the original versions are *still* not included. In a format such as blu-ray, with multiple other boxsets out there that have been done and done well with including multiple versions of a film, why, oh why, does George Lucas completely insist on not including the Original Trilogy on blu-ray? All he'd have to do is make clean transfers from the original negatives, bolster the sound, and hopefully recomposite the opticals (while not changing a damn thing!) to make it look prettier for blu, and that's it. It'd be over.     Unfortunately, I will have to stay with my dvds. I cannot support Lucas and his ever changing \\"vision\\" to get the films to how he wants them, simply because he chooses to ignore the fans request to be able to choose the version they want to watch. It'scompletely asinine.
0060920084|4.0|Many here have it wrong. It is not the book that is depressing. Or repetitive. Or plain. Or lacking in grand history (meaningless \\"historic markers\\" occur a-plenty). It is driving through Small Town America that is all those things. So why did someone of Bryson's intelligence not pretty it up? Why not throw in enough \\"redeeming\\" nuggets here and there? As some reviewers here suggest it would have made him more \\"quick bucks\\".     The answer, of course, is the answer to that age old question - why does a writer need to be true?    You picked up a book subtitled \\"Travels through Small Town America\\". What did you expect? Small Town America, especially of Bryson's sampling, primarily reveals itself to the traveler through its strip malls, and its sale of cheap calories. Conversation is whittled down to the stock oft-repeated phrases of service indifferently provided. And Bryson gives it to the reader in all its repetitive and bland glory, redeemed only by the spice of his cynicism. Not strong enough, this spice, one feels as one reads the book. But having finished it one realizes that had the spice been a lot stronger it would leave a bitter aftertaste. I think Bryson pulls his punches appropriately while being completely honest. I think he pays a bigger price for this honesty than the most dissatisfied reader. Isn't happy denial an easier state to be in when driving 6000 miles through Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Alabama...? Why constantly remind oneself that this is not fun? That one's childhood memories cannot be recovered or are disappointing when they can? Why does a writer need to be true?    This is not a great book, the subject matter would not allow that. But it is a unique book. It is clear that the writer who undertook this 6000-mile drive is a dedicated traveler. I shudder to think of those 6000 miles. And I thank Bryson for doing it and sharing his journey. I don't have to.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Excellent book! I hung on every word. The Heath Brothers do an amazing job of explaining complex human behavior in approachable, interesting, and understandable ways. This book changed my way of thinking, and influenced me to purchase two of the books in its Bibliography.

0060825456|4.0|Nothing will ever match the deliciously understated horror and shimmering brilliance of Gaiman's classic first edition, nor the perfection of Dave McKean's intuitively spot-on original illustrations (including the fine film adaptation), but this is a winner as far as graphic novel adaptations go. Noted illustrator P. Craig Russell does a consistently compelling job in communicating the mundane and ethereal horrors of Gaiman's story and tailoring the images in such a way that they can be appreciated by children as well as by adults. The emphasis here is more toward impressing children, I would wager, even as McKean aimed for a universal audience with his stark interpretations of Coraline's harrowing adventures with the \\"Other Mother\\". The result is a graphic novel that incorporates the bulk of Gaiman's original text and combines visuals that truly complement the trajectory and tones of the overall story. Nicely realized work. Your graphic novel collection, if you have one, ought not to be without this rendition of a classic.

B004LWZW4C|4.0|Wildly entertaining \\"X-Men: First Class\\" works amazingly well as both a prequel to the trilogy (there are inconsistencies between this film and the third one but it's also been suggested by the makers of this that it is a reboot since Professor Xavier and Magneto are working together in the third film and Professor X can walk in the third film and \\"Wolverine\\")and on its own even if you haven't seen the other films. It's refreshing particularly after \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" which had some major dramatic flaws.<br /><br />I'm going to skip the plot of the film because that's been well covered elsewhere except suffice to say that this is where Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender)first meet and try to stop Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon)a mutant determined to wipe out humanity.<br /><br />Evidently \\"X-Men: First Class\\" doesn't play on all Blu-ray players (most notably some of the 3D players and Samsung)so be aware that until they develop firmware updates it will be a problem for some players.

0439023513|5.0|**No Spoilers** I don't really understand the reviews that express disappointment at the reality of this last book of the series. Why would anyone think everyone would survive and live happily ever after? It is a tale of war. Katniss is a complicated, emotional, conflicted young woman. Isn't that what 17 year-olds are supposed to be like? Wouldn't war and loss magnify those traits? Anyway, I found the very end of the book emotionally satisfying and uplifting, because life does go on. When one simply goes through the motions, eventually some of the daily motions do, indeed, start to have meaning again. My perspective may differ from some readers as I am 43, not a young adult. A middle-aged life has brought setbacks. But, having children and being a teacher gives me hope. Overall, this was an excellent trilogy about adolescence, loss, humanity's cruelty and occasional but redemptive kindness. Highly, highly recommended reading. (PS I read the series on my Kindle. Love, love, love my Kindle!)
B003ASLJO0|1.0|\\"Gran Torino\\" is an emotionally satisfying, cathartic revenge movie of the Clint Eastwood genre. Clint stands up for the little guy against a bunch of bullies, the bullies retaliate brutally against Clint's weaker friend (Unforgiven?), after which Clint goes on the warpath and gives the bad guys their come-comeuppance. This type of movie is no less powerful for being predictable. Gran Torino is different in a couple of ways though. Firstly, in its characters and its setting, it has more texture than most movies of its type. Clint is the last White man in his once clean and safe Detroit neighborhood, now dominated by Hmong and blacks and is having a hard time dealing with the transformation. This is a situation that I don't recall being depicted by Hollywood before, and it is portrayed with great realism and grit. Secondly, this movie is different in that Clint's ultimate vengeance doesn't involve massacring all the bad guys, but in setting up his own murder so that the thugs are all arrested. So what's the problem with this movie?<br /><br />Clint's character is the victim of a historic injustice. In a neighborhood, a city and a country that he and his people built, he is now a stranger, living in a sea of criminals and parasitic foreigners imported into America by Teddy Kennedy's 1965 Immigration Act. The Democratic Party, with the cowardly complicity of the Republican Party and the ideological support of media and academia, have flooded America with non-White immigrants, to the point where Whites will be a minority in the U.S. by 2030. We didn't invite in foreigners based on their skill sets or personal character. So long as they were not White, it was ok with the Left so long as the hordes  undermined the dominance of Americans in their own country. The revolutionary and historical implications of this are obvious. No nation in history has ever voluntarily committed suicide. No nation in history has ever chosen to be conquered. Indeed, Americans never voted to give away our country to others, but that's still what's happening. We know what the Left called it when 19th century White men moved into African or Asian countries and took over the government. They call it colonialism, aggression, ethnic cleansing and genocide. When it's happening to 21st century White people in America and Europe, the Left calls it \\"diversity\\" and \\"multiculturalism\\". The implicit, and explicit, message of our Marxist masters is that White people need to die. Our continued existence is a bitter reminder of what America used to be: White, proud and strong. Therefore, we need to give away our neighborhoods, our cities, our country and our classic cars to our black, brown and yellow superiors and just die, while rejoicing in our destruction.<br /><br />It bears noting that this movie was written by a man named Schenk and produced by men named Gerber and Lorenz, along with Eastwood. Somehow, I think we'll be waiting in vain for a movie advocating the Right of Return for Palestinian refugees, extolling the glorious diversity that they would bring to Israel.our country to others, but that's still what's happening.

B001HN6922|1.0|Pixar has been the Wonder Child of 21st Century animation with a huge string of hits and only a few mis-steps along the way.  I own just about all of them.  Cars 1 was brilliant in plot, character development, backstory, technology, and practically perfect in every way.  After being teased for 2 years and waiting with baited breath for this must see, when this dog landed (no offense to dogs) it blew up and stunk like a wet one.  How could anybody screw up a franchise this badly?   No redeeming value at all and was a complete waste of celluloid--use 2 hours of your time watching paint peel and you'll get more out of it!  Sorry Pixar/Disney.....
6304981635|5.0|...it says 25th anniversary, but it's just one disc. That said, I'm not arguing there's a problem with this edition, at all. The bonus content is superb, though there's not a lot of different things. The film clarity is perfect, which is to be expected of course. It may be of interest to note that, the 2 American actors mainly starring alongside Mr. Lee, are champion martial artists as well. So, that makes this the greatest American kung fu movie and also, the best one from Hong Kong. This is a landmark film and unless, you can find it in a full collection of Bruce Lee's movies, this is what you want.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The same principle that prevents me from watching colorized versions of black-and-white movies keeps me from purchasing this set.  I don't want to see Star Wars 2011.  If I watch 'Casablanca,' I want to see the 1942 version.  If I watch 'Star Wars,' I want to see the 1977 version.  If I can't get the original, I'm not going to compromise and buy an altered copy.  Forget that.  Pass.
B005KG43AM|5.0|Okay, this is only five minutes of music, so it's not as if though we are going to get a whole CD or anything.  But still, this is a great performance.  I love the way Ingolf Wunder can play the music so effortlessly but with a real passion.<br /><br />The real reason you'll want to download this track is to see if you'll want to get the whole album, which was released this on Tuesday, September 13th: [[ASIN:B004P1YX6M Chopin Recital]].  You don't often get to sample a whole track from an album, but here you can.  Better hurry, though, because this track may not be free forever!<br /><br />Hurry, and then enjoy the music!<br /><br />P.S. I've looked into Wunder a little bit, and it sounds like he's a rising young star.  He came in second at the 2010 Warsaw International Piano Competition and has preceded to sign an exclusive recording contract with DG, the company famous for taking on talented youngsters.  He's only 26 right now, so he has a long time to continue to grow.  Will he turn out to be one of the leading pianists of his generation?  Time will tell.
B003EYVXT6|3.0|`Splice' is an average sci-fi horror film about what happens when two scientists start playing around with genes and nature and the dire consequences.<br /><br />Clive and Elsa are two scientists who splice DNA from different animals to make proteins for the medical industry.  When they secretly splice human DNA into the mix the result is a weird hybrid, who grows at an alarming rate and has unique characteristics that are at first intriguing and which quickly become more alarming.<br /><br />The special effects in this film are reasonable and the plot, whilst predictable and clich&eacute;d is entertaining enough.  The acting leaves a lot to be desired and I have seen Brody act a lot better than what he offers us in this film.<br /><br />This film feels a bit flat to be honest.  It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it doesn't offer anything new and it plods along without any real zest or flair.  It feels like it is a `sci-fi by-numbers' film and the director doesn't try to do anything new or original with the concept.<br /><br />Never-the-less it is worth a viewing if you can catch it on TV for free or as part of a rental package.  It isn't quite as bad as some people have said, but it's not far off!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B005D63LL6|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with the developments from season 4. I was happy to see the end of the Rita character and story line. The writing team on Dexter have a wealth of creativity that has kept the show fresh each and every season. But season 5 is something special. A richly developed storyline, enhanced by the superb performance of guest star Julia Stiles made this season the highlight of the show so far. Bravo!
B0041KKYGU|1.0|This was one of the worst movies ever.  The only good things about this movie is Jason Segel, and he only had a minor role.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas took one of the most hated lines from the prequels and added it to the original trilogy... Its almost as if hes doing this to spite the fans. Do not buy this. Instead, just find some nice fan edits somewhere & watch those.
B0043WHRWA|5.0|This is a great TV show, I can watch them over and over.  There is something to be said about the chemistry between the two main actor/actress.  If you like mystry and suspence with a tocuh of fun, then this is the show for you.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|What disappoints me most about Lucas is, not the fact that he keeps \\"updating\\" his \\"abandoned\\" movies, but when he does make these awful changes, he forces his audience to abide them and disregards their personal preferences by not releasing the original/unaltered versions of the original trilogy. Also it seems almost as if he were sneaking these changes in to get us to purchase a product not-as-advertised, as we only recently discovered these changes, so close to the release.    It's a shame that the most we can do is simply cancel these pre-orders, as it's not likely Lucas will have a change of heart.
B0054SMIH6|2.0|This movie starts out showing us that Mcconaughey plays a smooth, tough as nails, street wise defense attorney who is as good as it gets in criminal cases.  Then it rolls into a pretty good story with a high profile case.  Don't be seduced by the flashy trailer and synopses, this movie is no such thing.  It's a very, very bad thriller that hinges on an implausible and faulty notion of the meaning of attorney client privilege.    Shall I explain?  Attorney client privilege only applies to what the client says about the case!  If a client confesses a crime or says he's going to commit one, that is not privileged, in fact it's your ethical duty as an attorney to notify the police if you believe your client is going to commit a crime, has committed one, or is going to otherwise harm himself, and no, you do not get disbarred for doing so.  It's the same thing you do as a psychiatric counselor, and no, your headshrinker wouldn't lose his license either!  The conflict of this \\"thriller\\" is that Mcconaughey's client confesses to a past crime in which a former client of Mcconaughey's is in prison for, confesses to breaking in to Mcconaughey's home, to threatening harm on Mcconaughey's family, and to having Mcconaughey's partner killed, and rather than hold its screenwriters to accurate representations of what attorneys do, they tell us that Mcconaughey's going to lose his license if he brings any of this to the police which is indeed his duty to do so.  Huh?  Did the writers actually ask an attorney what attorney client privilege means?   I guess not.    At this point of the film, it just turns to trash and I'm told the novel is the same.  Excuse me for being so critical, but I'm sure you're the same way.  You want your sports movies to accurately represent the sport your watching.  You want racing movies to accurately use car talk.  You want medical movies to plausibly show what doctors do, but why can't we have such high profile crime thrillers like this accurately show anattorney?    Mcconaughey is over all the smooth, brazen, and cool Mcconaughey we like watching, rather than the watered down one he usually is in his Rom Coms, but all that is wasted on bad writing.

B004LWZW4C|4.0|X-MEN: FIRST CLASS presents an interesting premise: let's cast talented dramatic actors in the roles of superheroes and see what happens.  It worked for BATMAN BEGINS; why can't it work for the decidedly campier X-Men?<br /><br />It does, more or less.  The story itself isn't all that interesting: friends Charles and Erik are recruited to train a ragtag group of mutant youths to be super spies for Cold War-era U.S.  (Kudos to director Matthew Vaughen for rooting this film in the sixties; the atmosphere comes off beautifully.)  Things start to go awry when these fledgling superheroes come up against a former Nazi who has a few interesting secrets of his own.<br /><br />The two lead roles are brilliantly cast: James McAvoy, as Charles Xavier, exudes charm and elegance (even when trying to get laid); and Michael Fassbender's Magneto is cool and calculating, with rage boiling just beneath the surface.  As the Nazi doctor, Kevin Bacon is hit-and-miss; his first scene is breathtaking (he projects so much villainous menace, I wanted to go up to the screen and punch him), but as the years progress, his character becomes campier and campier, sporting a horrible hairpiece and a piecemeal accent.  Jennifer Lawrence is great as Mystique; Oliver Platt adds some welcome comedic relief as a government agent; January Jones makes a decidedly wooden Emma Frost; and Nicholas Hoult's Beast is appropriately confused and desperate.  There's also a great cameo from a series mainstay (only half a spoiler; let's face it, you knew it was coming) that pretty much makes the entire film.  (That cameo, plus Kevin Bacon's first scene, are worth the price of admission alone.)<br /><br />The film takes a nice dark turn in the middle, but it never really gets as dark as it should.  Fassbender and McAvoy are ready and willing to go there (hell, in most of his scenes, Fassbender's already there; somebody just give this man an Oscar already, you know he's going to get one eventually), but Vaughn and company hold back, probably to keep with the more light-hearted feel of the Bryan Singer films. It's a disappointing move, but X-MEN: FIRST CLASS still comes out as a great popcorn flick, maybe not quite as entertaining as X-MEN or X-MEN 2, but a mile and a half above the travesties that were X-MEN: LAST STAND and ORIGINS: WOLVERINE.  It's got talented actors hamming it up a bit, which is always worth watching, and a director who knows how to give you equal amounts of action, intrigue, and humor.  If you're a fan of the characters, or just like the genre in general, you'll find this film worth repeated viewings.y to keep with the more light-hearted feel of the Bryan Singer films.

B005KAH7QU|1.0|As my title says, \\"How did this get such rave reviews?\\"  Simply put the first part of the film is what you'd hope for--tense, action packed, and mysterious, a great setup that leads to...well, a movie so dull I almost fell asleep watching it.  What little action there is amounts to nibbles spread out into a few fights and a LOT of chases; see Hannah meet people we could care less about, and see them die; see Hannah act with all the emotion of a robot.  See the end sequence come and just END, no epilogue, no follow-up.<br /><br />Unless you've got insomnia and need something to put you out for the night?  Avoid this like the plague.
B004EPYZPI|3.0|Mick Haller is a street-smart lawyer with an ex-wife, a young daughter, and an ego.  His bondsman has just snagged him another case: Louis Roulet, accused of sexual assault and attempted murder.  Roulet professes innocence, and Haller, for once, believes him.  But the case is deeper and murkier than it appears on the surface, and Haller is about to be confronted with something even worse than an innocent client: true evil.<br /><br />Brad Furman's THE LINCOLN LAWYER hews fairly close to the Michael Connolly source novel for the first two-thirds, which presents some good things (suspense, an interesting lead character) and bad things (major plot holes and contrivances).  Matthew McConaughey is perfect for the role of Haller (apparently, Connolly himself wanted McConaughey for the role); he never truly sinks his teeth in, but he's sufficiently charming, troubled, and devious to keep you entertained.  The film features a great deal of talented actors (Bryan Cranston, John Leguizamo, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, Shea Whigham, and Michael Pena) who never truly get their chance to shine, and other mediocre actors (Josh Lucas, Ryan Phillippe, even Trace Adkins for God's sake) who get stuck with two-dimensional characters.<br /><br />In it's final act, though, THE LINCOLN LAWYER diverges from the novel, and this presents a major problem: the moral ambiguity Connolly built up so effectively is utterly lost.  This doesn't completely ruin the movie--note the three stars--but it puts a damper on things.  Still, fans of the genre won't care.  If you want a slick thriller, with a touch of suspense, a charming lead, and a bit of intrigue, THE LINCOLN LAWYER is right up your (well-lit) alley.

B005IFWXWU|5.0|Hugh Laurie is a fantastic actor, but that wouldn't excuse him if he released terrible music. That doesn't seem to be the case here. I am and never have been a Blues guy, but this album is quickly turning me. I'm really enjoying it and I encourage people who don't like the Blues to give this album a go anyways.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This was supposed to be THE blu-ray set of the year. I pre-ordered this in January and was getting very excited about this release, even if it would've had the 2004 version, which I was fine with that. 9 Discs, containing 6 films and 3 bonus discs, for 80 dollars (used to be 90)?  What a deal!   Of course, this was before footage of the new Blu-ray was shown on Youtube.  Obi-Wan's new Dragon call, the zoom-in shot of Jabba's Door in ROTJ, and finally, the worst change of all... Darth Vader now saying \\"NO\\" in the climax of ROTJ.  And yes... these are real.  Confirmed by Lucasfilm themselves...  Let me say this: these changes are just awful and unnecessary.    The latter change is probably the biggest insult to the original trilogy... WORSE than \\"Greedo Shoots First\\".  How can he do this to the climax of ROTJ?  It was perfect to begin with, so why change something that was never broken?!  Of course, the Original versions are not included. (I actually thought they wouldn't be released at first like they did for the DVD.  Is Seamless Branching too much for you, George?  And to further add insult to this set, Episode 1 might have changed Yoda to CGI, but Episodes 2 and 3 are not altered (10/8/11: It's been brought to my attention that there are actually a few changes made to Episodes 2 and 3).  ... are you telling me that George wants the Original Trilogy to be like the Prequels?  ... It can't be true, it can't be!  Why would he do this to our childhoods?!   This fiasco gave me the final decision to cancel the pre-order and boycott this release.  Anyone who buys this will be part of the Dark Side... which is Lucasfilm.  THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS MUST NOT BE ERASED FROM HISTORY.  WE WANT WHAT WE DEMAND, LUCAS!  I'm not paying any future Star Wars media until the Originals are presented... remastered on a Blu-ray format.  You can include the new versions however you please, but you'll make more money if you release the originals bundled.  UPDATE 10/8/11: OK... after this wholefiasco, I stopped complaining about this set... what else is there to complain about?  Thankfully, I don't have this set, but from observations presented on the net, if there's one change that will be the worst change of all, it's Darth Vader saying \\"NO!\\" in Return/Jedi.  Now, for the record, it's a bit (that's saying something) better than the \\"NO\\" in Revenge/Sith, but it's been done horribly.  1) The timing was off. The \\"No\\" should've ended before the shot when we see him lifting the emperor.  2) He doesn't sound like the usual Vader.  As for the changes, I can live without (or just shut up about that).
B004Y1USV2|5.0|When I first heard that Yes was coming out with a new record I was excited.  Then when I heard it was without Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman I wasn't sure I would buy it.

B002ZG983M|5.0|I went into to this movie thinking it was just another parody movie.  I was soooo wrong.  Not only was this movie hilarious, but it also was so much more serious than I though it was going to be.  There was an actual plot!  (I know, *gasp*).  This movie did two things: 1)poked fun at the whole super-hero thing and 2) embraced it.  I've seen it several times now, and just love it!  I highly recommend this movie.  Although fair warning: lots of gore, violence, and language.

142311339X|2.0|Is it just me, or has Riordan's writing gotten lazier since Percy Jackson?     Don't get me wrong--there's nothing lazy about Riordan's plotting here. The story is intricately woven and well-structured, alternating between the viewpoints of the three major characters. Their adventures are just as heart-poundingly rapid as the ones visited upon Percy Jackson, and there's a generous helping of humor. However, that is where the charm wears off.     First of all, I love characters. I love getting to know them the way I'd get to know a friend. This is what drew me in to the Percy Jackson series: You get to know Percy through his insights and actions. The part where he sends Medusa's severed head to Olympus was what made me love him in the first place. It was hilarious, but it also showed Percy's personality--his wanting to show off for his dad, but also say \\"Screw you, Zeus!\\" It was brilliant. And while Percy was kind of a shallow character, I at least felt like I knew him by the end of The Lightning Thief.     In The lost Hero, however, I don't feel like I know any of the characters. They're little more than Everykid stereotypes. Piper is the daughter of a famous actor who acts out because she feels like she doesn't get enough attention. Leo is the jokester son of Hephaestus who accidentally killed his mom. And Jason is the son of Zeus, who also happened to lose his memory, so there's really nothing to him. That's it. That's all there is to the main characters.     The villians are even worse. In Percy Jackson, the villains at least had some degree of complexity. Luke felt abandoned by his dad, which drove him to Kronos. Prometheus was slick and slimy, but you could tell he at least wanted to help the humans. In The Lost Hero, the villains are all one-dimensional. Midas is crazy and likes to turn people into gold. Khione is the snow goddess (read: a frigid ice witch) who awakened Gaea because she is Evil. Why? Well....because Riordan is obviously a Southerner who thinkssnow is Evil, so Khione is evil. And don't even get me started on his portrayal of Medea! He took one of the most complex characters in Greek mythology and made her so one-sided and predictable it made me yawn.     All this one-dimensionality made me long for Daedalus. What Riordan did with his character was incredible. He combined remorse with determination and fear, topping it all off with a frightening level of intelligence, giving us a wonderfully complicated demigod on the run from his own past. He was an antihero, but an extremely heroic one who even managed to break the Antihero mold. Daedalus showed us that Riordan can take a mythological character and flesh him out into something completely original, yet familiar. When I read the scenes with Midas and Medea, I couldn't help but think \\"Riordan, you can do better. Stop playing it safe.\\"     In all, this is a safe book for Riordan. It allowed him to stick to action sequences and Evil villains--which seems to be his comfort zone. Stop playing it safe, Riordan! Push the envelope! Give us back our complex villains and loveable heroes! Don't worry about doing it wrong; we're all cheering for you!     I have not yet decided if I will read the second book in this series. As it stands, I probably won't.
0316098329|4.0|This book was difficult to get into at first due to the fact that it's written the way a five year old speaks. This made it really annoying for me at first. However, once the story really picks up, it's tough to put down!!! Definitely worth it!!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Wow, from the beginning of this DVD, I was captivated...as was my husband, my 86 year old mother, 17 year old granddaughter and boyfriend and 9 year old grandson who asked to see it again the next day he said, \\"because it was such a good movie\\"...it works for all ages.  The story line has it all including inspiration, drama, comedy, faith, competition, courage, determination and gorgeous photography of the Hawaiian waves and curls that takes your breath away.  Be ready to tear up at times as even the tough 17 year olds did and the retired sheriff did as well.  One of the best aspects of the film is that it is about a family and friends who stick together, have fun and never quit.  Bethany Hamiliton continues to be a pro surfer even after a shark takes her arm, an experience where most of us would give up.  The cutbacks to the real family at the end and the fact that Bethany did some of the surfing sequences is an added plus as well as the great performances by the stars Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt and Carrie Underwood. Super DVD!
1451629184|5.0|Like probably most everyone else, I've been riveted by stories in magazines and in the news about Jaycee Dugard. And like probably most everyone else, I've had a morbid curiosity about what actually happened during her captivity.     This is her detailed account of what happened: how one June morning in 1991, she walked to the bus stop like on any other ordinary school day, only on this day, a man by the name of Phillip Garrido pulled up alongside her in his car, reached his hand out the window, and paralyzed her with a stun gun, and then, with the help of his wife, Nancy, abducted her, drove her to their home a couple hours away and proceeded to keep her in captivity in their backyard for the next eighteen years. Eighteen years! It's almost inconceivable. During this time, she becomes no less than Phillip Garrido's sex slave and bears two children by him, giving birth both times in the squalid backyard, the first time when she was only fourteen years old.    It is an utterly riveting read, and yet, extremely difficult and disturbing. What this girl endured was horrific, and I honestly don't think I could have read it had I not known that in the end, she triumphs.    I got the impression that the book is intentionally not over-edited; it has a very stream-of-consciousness tone to it and very much reads like a young girl pouring her heart and memories out. And yes, she does still come across as very young; her writing has a very adolescent tone to it, which makes perfect sense - she was abducted at the age of eleven, and in a big way began a state of almost suspended animation at that point, being robbed of all the ordinary life experiences that mature a person.    It's very much worth reading, but not for the faint-of-heart.
B0050SRZOQ|5.0|I was hooked on Smallville from the pilot episode. This series had everything from teen angst, camp, romance, science fiction, fantasy, comedy, drama, and action.  The casting was spot on for every character introduced in the series.  This series was an incredible ride from start to finish; it was plain outright fun and entertaining and it never disappointed.  The finale was great.  The writers had a lot to wrap-up in the finale.  Not only did that have to wrap-up lose ends from the series, but they had to accomplish the set-up to Superman and what will come afterward.  They did that and more.  Fans of this show will forever love the characters.  There is no better Lex Luther, Lois Lane, or Clark Kent than Michael Rosenbaum, Erica Durance, and Tom Welling.  Justin Hartley was the perfect Green Arrow and the character of Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) has earned her place in the Superman mythos.  Congratulations to the enite cast and crew of Smallville.  They brought us quality television for ten years.  Television is seriously lacking these days.  I have purchased the entire series on DVD and plan to watch it again from start to finish.  A great story and a lot of fun.
B005HFUQAM|5.0|Every time I listen to any of Beirut's albums, I'm instantly, pleasantly adrift. The lilt of the vocals, the gorgeous instrumentation, and the harmonious way in which it all comes together; it's very hard not to be caught up in this music. This album does not disappoint. Just as another reviewer had mentioned, there's an evident evolution without Beirut losing the fundamentals that made them such a unique wonderful band. On a road trip, strolling through the park, even walking through the city, this album will be on heavy rotation with an appreciative smile on my face for quite a while.
0439023491|4.0|Very easy read. A bit predictable through the whole series, but still a good story. Kept me interested through all three. I read them all between Tuesday and Friday, so that says something right there.
B0053ZOQMK|2.0|I usually enjoy animated films --  this was a disappointment.  I agree with most reviewers: this film is not for kids.  The animation was top-notch, but the plot was weak and characters poorly developed.  There was nothing interesting about the plot or the characters.  Perhaps, it was written for people who enjoy the seen-one seen'em all westerns.  Because I thought the plot was weak and the characters uninteresting, I also found the film too long.  Perhaps it would have made a good short -- with the quality of the film depending primarily on the high quality animation.  As is, I do not recommend watching this film unless you REALLY like westerns, Depp, and animated film.
1451629184|5.0|This book hit me to the core. The abuse this child had to endure, and the inner strength she had to find in herself to survive that horrible environment for 18 years - I am speechless. Kudos to you for finding the courage to write a book that opened you up to the world. Kudos to you for finding the healing you needed, and kudos for being a great mom to your children. Sad that the people who gave it a one or two star review failed to see the soul of this book, or did not even finish it. Had they read it all they might have a change of heart. Yes, the first parts of the book are hard to take, but you have to read the rest. Then you get the whole picture. Thank you Jaycee, for writing this in your own words.
B0051OZ564|1.0|This film is terrible and an absolute waste of time. Watch it at your own peril. You have been warned. That is all.
B0050XH1H2|4.0|Terrific new band - really fine album.  It is a bit derivative of several bands, but they make it their own and play with passion and style.  Two good songs clock in under two minutes and the longer songs do not drag on or get bogged down.  Crisp, sharp and a lot of fun to listen to.  Saw them at Lollapalooza - catch them live if you can.  I want to hear more from these guys.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This album is fantastic. Nas and Damian Marley really sound good together and it shows. The songs have great subject matters and you can actually learn something from this album which is hard to say about most popular hip hop releases today. You can really tell they put a lot of thought into this project and put a lot of their philosophy into their music. The title Distant Relatives means that every human is related and comes from Africa whether you are black, white, asian, latino, native american etc. It has a very powerful and positive message throughout and in my opinion is a classic album    Favorite Songs:  Patience   In His Own Words  Strong Will Continue  Africa Must Wake up
B005J7K964|5.0|I used to have a friend who let me borrow his Laserdisc copy of Giorgio Moroder's version of Metropolis. I thought that was a better copy than VHS.  Moroder's version was never to be found again in print, and I was hoping for a DVD release,  Now it's on Blu-ray !  Thank you, thank you!!!  I already own the restored black and white version DVD, but Moroder's music score and color tinting, fits with the futuristic ideas of the movie, IMHO. The sound effects are not bad too, like when Freder stumbles into Rotwang's lab. Actually, I saw a screening of Moroder's version first before the classic B&W. I'm happy now that I'll own both versions.  Thanks again.

What people who are not stricken by this affliction - `a stutter'; `a stammer'; `a speech impediment' - may not realise is the anguish in the effort simply to speak; to say words, phrases and sentences, that others take for granted. His own agony was conveyed, in my view, more by how others reacted to him (rather than him reflecting on his own dread) as he made speeches. I used to have nightmares about the following morning when I would have to stand and say &#34;present&#34; at school assembly. I used to agonise (jump with panic even) when a `phone rang and I was the nearest to answer. Things have certainly improved to the point that I now have a solid history of presenting technical papers at international events. I am also clear that my early career, till I was about 40, was hampered because of this 'disability'. So the film does a service to sufferers by helping to share what it's like to have a stammer (although more of his fear would have conveyed the crucial extra dimension; the psychological impact, the acute embarrassment with women and so on). Mine rarely erupts now but I still dread being in a meeting of strangers and having to introduce myself...  Ian Hunter.

B000OXHRRC|1.0|The characters in this film were uninteresting to say the least.  They also did and said stupid, illogical things to set up plot points and/or \\"laughs\\" that fell flat.  Crowe can be great but this was not a good part for him.  You can feel the failure within the first 10 minutes but I went over halfway through before giving up. I realized that I no longer cared what happened next.  It was beautifully shot with nice locations but that doesn't make up for it.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|If you are caring for a person who had a stroke, whether it is your own friend or family member or you are caring for stroke patients in some sort of nursing capacity--you MAY be able to make a world of difference in their life by reading this book.  If you do nothing else, at least look at the list that this fully recovered stroke victim AND brain scientist added to the back of the book.  It could greatly enhance your ability to help them recover more fully.    In fact, I have a feeling that you will hope (as I did) that IF you ever become the patient, that whoever ends up caring for you will also have read it!!!  Very, important and helpful insights.    The book itself is great.  I've always found the brain to be a fascinating thing--what we perceive as reality, what makes us different from each other and what makes us human.  On that level, it was also extremely interesting.  In fact (and this sounds a little strange), it made me less afraid of dying someday.  It is actually a hopeful book that makes you realize that our brain is so busy making sense of everything and taking care of \\"ourself\\" that we are actually missing a great deal of what is really going on around us.  This book brings home the reality that we are actually part of \\"everything\\" and always will be.    Excellent book.  One that everyone really should read.  Skip over the few boring parts--just keep reading and it may give you a new way of seeing things.

B004VQFQ2Q|3.0|Still getting to know this albumn. I love the 1st 4 albumns by Black Sabbath. Never was a big fan of Dio. I do like Ian Gillan's work with Deep Purple so I bought this   to check it out. I've only listened to it a couple times but I like it so far. I really enjoy hearing Ian's interpretation of the classic hits on the live section. What I'm disapointed in is the packageing. My other deluxe addition Sabbath CD's have a clear plastic sleeve on the outside with deluxe addition printed on it. It protects the CD case. When I saw this CD in the picture it looked like it was the same. I was surprised to find that the deluxe edition banner is simply a piece of tape that you have to cut to open the case! What a cruel trick! Oh, the CD is remastered but it still doesn't sound as clear as it should.  Black Sabbath---Born Again----import.

0007202288|5.0|The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is something every adult and child should read. I know people are always weary to pick up a book that has a religious theme to it but C.S. Lewis is enjoyable no matter what you choose to believe.     During WWII, Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy Pevensie have to leave London and their mother as they seek refuge in the English countryside with Digory Kirke. The children amuse themselves by exploring and playing games; one day, Lucy steps into a wardrobe and into Narnia, a magical land where she meets Tumnus, a friendly faun, who invites her to him home and tells her about the evil White Witch.    When she returns to the real world, Peter, Edmund, and Susan believe she's lying; Edmund, however, goes into the wardrobe and enters Narnia. He has the misfortune of meeting the White Witch who bribes him with Turkish Delight and encourages him to bring Peter and his sisters back with him.    While trying to hide from a group of visitors, the four Pevensie children pile into the wardrobe and step back into Narnia; Lucy leads them to Tumnus' house but finds that he has been taken by the White Witch. From then on, the children meet friends, battle the power of evil temptation, and search for the true King of Narnia: Aslan.    This story is unlike anything I've ever read before. I couldn't help but admire the brilliant way Lewis wove together so many stories yet made it uniquely his own. Making a trip into Narnia is something everyone should do and your first step is The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe!

0786838655|4.0|I love mythology so after I saw the movie adaptation, I bought the entire book series to read. I find that there were parts I enjoyed more in the movie than in the book, and vice versa. For example, I thought the movie's version about the three pearls was more creative than the way the book described this. I know readers tend to like the books more, but I felt like the movie made a great decision when they changed this. With that being said, I loved the scene in the book about Waterland concerning Ares and Aphrodite- I thought that was a fantastic scene and I tip my hat to Rick Riordan.    In short, this was an enjoyable read- even for someone well above the age-target and I recommend others to read it if you're interested at all in mythology!

1573229725|4.0|I will not repeat the plot, which has been described so well by others.<br /><br />When I started reading the book I did not realise that the story would be told first from Sue's point of view, then from Maude's point of view.  The description on the book itself seemed to indicate this was told only from Sue's pov.  So when I found myself starting again with Maude I was, at first, set aback.  But I should have known to trust Sarah Waters - the second story was as fascinating as the first, though very different.  And both stories, of course, blended in the end.<br /><br />My favourite part of this novel is the way that both girls take control of their own destinies and manage to grant themselves a satisfactory ending.  While reading I was wondering how on earth Sarah Waters would resolve everything.  Her solution was the best kind - unexpected and yet exactly what it should have been given everything that came before.<br /><br />I wish I could write the way Sarah Waters does - but happily I get to read what she has written.
0307454541|3.0|My challenge with this book is in the way it was translated.  The authors refers to so many places and dispenses with so many proper nouns that are not relevant to US readers.  I found myself Googling many of the places so that I'd have a point of reference.  He spends too much time describing who lived where naming streets all to what end?  I found myself skimming through many passages that were inundated with needless descriptions.  Once over those hurdles I was finally able to focus on the story.<br /><br /> I still don't understand why when books are translated for American audiences they still spell things using European English (realise vs. realize);  this is such a distraction.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I enjoyed the entire first season.  The stories were very good and getting to know each character was great; as well as watching the chemistry that developed between characters.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|I preordered this item because I liked the movie in the theaters. I got it home and put it in the ps3 and sat back to enjoy a nice movie with my family. Then I notice that it is constantly pausing a couple times per minute for 1-5 seconds or so each time. Very annoying. I figure maybe my ps3 needs a firmware update to handle this disk, but I have the latest firmware.  No problem I figure. I'll just put the dvd in. Oh, I didn't get a dvd, I got this other disk that's called digital copy. Great, I'll put that in my xbox... Nothing happens. Hmm. Okay, I'll put it into my pc, copy the file onto a USB thumb drive, then pop that into my xbox. Hmm. Doesn't work. WTF? I can't watch my movie? Then I think, okay, I'll copy the file to my wifes computer, which is visible from the xbox, maybe I can stream it from there. Oh, the DRM only allows the movie to be copied once, and it's locked to the device I originally copied it to. Well, if I knew it was going to do that, I would have plugged the digital copy disk into the cup holder on my tv so I don't have to sit in my office chair with my family on my lap to watch the new movie that I just bought, on a stinkin pc, after sitting in front of a stinkin pc all day at work.
0316236535|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old kept quoting this book from reading it at daycare, so I finally found it on here and bought it! We read it every night and he just loves it. Out of the 500 books he has to pick from, this one he comes back to time and time again!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|If you spend your hard-earned money on this, then you are a chump. A chump, a sucker, an easy mark. No doubt about it. Take your money and give it to charity instead, it will do more good than this travesty.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|For those who have never seen the original, like me, this was one of the best dramatic horror films produced in decades. While it has gory parts, it focuses more on the relationships between the characters, in a sympathetic perspective because of the innocence of the two 12 year old characters, except of course the one hasn't been 12 in many decades. Real vampire thrills, versus romanticized versions in recent years, going beyond even Anne Rice's version. If one has seen The Grudge, one may recognize the movements from that in this, the girl moves creepily, attacking in fast forward speed with jerky inhuman effects. The acting is incredibly great, the quality of special effects, visual & sound all excellent production values. Thrilling & suspenseful without being a nail-biting, cover your eyes kind of movie, yet never once boring or slow. Several plot twist surprises keep the film from being at all predictable, unless of course you have seen the original & know what is coming. I doubt I've ever seen two more beautiful actors than the 2 children in this movie, I could not take my eyes off the boy especially, but both were perfect. I would not recommend this to children under 18, the PG rating is not correct or consistent with other such film's ratings, at the very least parental guidance & discernment is called for before allowing a younger child to view this. I would definitely watch it again and recommend it to others, worth every penny & every minute, and then some.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|So I read this book expecting a lot since the previous two books were amzing! As i got further through the book, i just hated it more and more. The first half was ok but pretty uneventful. After they got peeta back though the whole thing just went downhill.  I hated how collins changed katniss from the strong warrior we saw earlier to a soldier. It was immensly boring! She just wasnt the same. And then how SPOLIER prim just blows up like it doesnt even matter. collins was killing characters one by one until everyone goes away. I was absolutely mortified when i realized prim actually did die.  And after that the whole war thing just mgically ends! It was stupid and just didnt feel real since it wasnt put together. It was like i skipped from the war to some random page and thats what i just happened to find.   Then the part that really annoyed me was how collins just killed or moved everyone so that katniss would end up with peeta. Gale ended up in the capitol somewhere and basically nevr sees katniss again. Terrible ending to a bad book.     Finaaly theres like two pgs at the end that talk about katniss and peeta having kids. Its just so random! its pretty obvous that collins wanted that cathartic end of thee book feel but it just didnt work.  overall i wish i had never bought the book. it was a waste of my money. So i know youll probably buy it anyway to decide for yourself and to finish the series but dont expect too much from this final book. I loved the first two this one was just pathetic and not an accurate depiction of collins talent.

B004L3AR0K|4.0|If you have issues with explicit sex scenes or foul language, I'd skip this one and try another movie.<br /><br />I can't help but think that perhaps Jake Gyllenhaal is trying to (over) compensate for his other movie, Brokeback Mountain.  In this movie he is a pharmaceutical drug rep trying to sell his quota of drugs through doctors.<br /><br />He is a horny little SOB, but falls for a girl with medical problems (Parkinson's Disease).  Any reasonable person would drop her off considering what is in store in the future, he hangs on to her in spite of whatever is in the way.  It sounds soo romantic and idealistic, but remember this is only a movie, and very enjoyable at that.<br /><br />I also wondered if this whole movie was an In-Place-Advertising for Pfizer.  Now I know better to choose Zoloft instead of Prosac.  As far as Viagra goes, I'll bring my truck, you load it up!<br /><br />After I watched this movie, something that happened in the past makes perfect sense now.  I used to operate a brewery.  I had a very bad back ache one day, but also had to deal with a group of customers.  I mentioned to the guy who booked the whole thing that I had a back ache.  He said he could help me and gave me boxes of Celebrex that fixed my back in no time.  It turned out that he was a pharm. rep and the rest of the group was all doctors.  He paid for the whole thing (over $500).<br /><br />One more thing.  Towards the end of the movie Maggie complains that the life is not fair.  I also hear the same thing from my children.  You know what, just get used to it.  It has never been fair, and it will never be fair.  Deal with it!<br /><br />This is a light entertaining movie.  Sex, drugs, and not much of any rock n roll.
B005LAMY30|5.0|The season is developing differently than I had expected.  That's a good thing.  One of my many favorite things about Breaking Bad is that no matter how closely you pay attention and how many times you rewatch the episodes, you always end up being surprised.<br /><br />There have been so many crime dramas, not that I like to pick on CSI, but that is one of the best examples, that purposely divert your attention one moment, and then the next, bombards you with CGI'd dramatizations that are wildly inaccurate of procedures or details.  They are programs that are designed for presentation with commercials, popping popcorn or multitasking where the content is so simplistic that you can miss or lose concentration and still follow the story.  Not much of a challenge.  It's also vastly different from completely formulaic series like Numbers and a lot of the mystery series from the past, that gave you new characters, but largely the same story or plot.  There was one when I was a child, called Murder She Wrote that had almost the same three story lines every week.<br /><br />Breaking Bad is one of a kind.  It takes you down a road, one degree separating your reality, one misstep, one flakey decision, one unexpected life-down-turn from where and who you are.  Nothing is so far-fetched that it couldn't happen to you or someone you know, and yet, the adrenaline pumps constantly.  You want to slap Walt or Jesse senseless.  Or, you wonder what is going on a few doors or blocks from you...no matter where you live.<br /><br />I really think that Walt is going through the stages of grief as the plot unfolds, with a huge emphasis on his anger over having completely lost control of his life.  He keeps trying to feed his ego to avoid dealing with his ultimate fate.  He throws himself into the mouth of danger only to freak himself out and end up panicked into a frenzy to save himself.  He tries to believe he can control those around him, and yet, the harder the tries, the more mistakes he makes...<br /><br />This week he proves he needs anger-management therapy...as well as driving lessons.  Jesse and Skyler learn more about moving on, and Hank takes it up a notch. Gus gives us clues as to who he really is, although, once again, paying attention to previous episodes would have helped us to see him as he is.<br /><br />Finally, are we going to learn more about a powerful government agent with a greying moustache?<br /><br />I just know the layers never seem to end, and now that I know there will be a fifth season, what will lay the groundwork for it?<br /><br />Let's just stick with \\"What happens next?\\"he proves he needs anger-management therapy...as well as driving lessons.

B005ETA5K2|5.0|I moved to a new place, and there were no ethernet outlets in my room to reach my desktop. So after a lengthy research, I decided to purchase this USB adapter for my desktop. This is the newest version of Alfa USB wi-fi adapter. The previous versions had good reviews, so I didn't hesitate to try this one out. The result? I'm really happy with it. It took some time to set it up properly, but their support team is excellent. Now that it is set up, it works flawlessly and detects wi-fi signal very well. Highly recommended!
B000VI6T6U|5.0|Probably the two most important Jimi Hendrix performances were at the beginning...and likewise .... near the end of his time performaing in the U.S. I'm speaking, of course, about the sacrifice of his guitar to the audience at the end of \\"The Combined English and American Anthems\\", i.e. \\"Wild Thing\\" ... at the close of his performance at the Monterrey Pop Festival. Similarly, his performance of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", near the end of his show at Woodstock nearly bookends his short American career. Both of these performances have to be seen to be believed and appreciated.<br /><br />The guitar sacrifice at the Monterrey Pop Festival is depicted here powerfully. The cameras pan out on a couple of audience members who were obviously \\"stunned\\" by this legendary, shocking and masterful performance by a true guitar, musical and performance genius. This is an Iconic Moment in Rock and almost has to be seen by anyone who truly wants to know Rock and Roll, whether it be the music..or the lifestyle.
8862937148|1.0|I used to LOVE Moleskines and as I awaited my new 2012 Calendar, I was so disappointed to see how cheap the quality now is. That is what I loved in the first place and now they are trying to save some money and outsource to China just like every other non loyal brand does. Well this will be the last time I order this until it is made in the USA again.   What a pity. Paper is cheap, binder is different, no 2012 engraved...just not the same.
B005BZQS1E|1.0|I saw \\"Your Highness\\" in the theater and it is the first time I ever walked out on a movie before it was over.  I don't have high standards and I have sat through some stinkers.    The writing and jokes were lame, the plot drearily predictable.  The actors McBride and Franco were sleepwalking through their roles.  Even seeing Natalie Portman naked from behind was not enough to overcome how bad this movie was and keep me in the theater.    This movie was so bad that I am compelled to write a review - something I very rarely do - telling you how bad it was.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I saw all 6 Star Wars episodes during their original runs in the theater. I collected all of the toys. It was a part of my childhood. Just as I was beginning to get over the fact that I hated Haydn Christensen as Anakin and the strange racial tones of Jar Jar Binks, George Lucas has once again decided to destroy his own work and mess with my childhood memories. Not only is he replacing Yoda with the soulless CGI version, but among other unnecessary changes he is actually making Vader say, \\"No!\\" as he sends the Emperor to the abyss. Truly unbelievable and a finger to all of his longtime fans.    I think this is actually it, I am sadly done with Star Wars.
0307463745|1.0|So many of the negative reviewers just hit the nail on the head.  I tried to give this book a chance, but every time I read a ridiculous thing like \\"don't plan your business for the long term\\" my better judgement saved me.  This book reads like it was written by a college student who probably dropped out and joined 37Signals.  It's so misguided, you will be infinitely better off finding a REAL, well researched, truly insightful, book about being an entrepreneur and how to achieve success in your business.  I run my own business and when I shared some of the points of this book with my partner, it resulted in comments like, \\"You can't be serious, are you?\\" and \\"Stop now and never admit to ANYONE you read that book!\\"  REWORK is that off target and irresponsible in preaching really bad business \\"lessons.\\"  Avoid it at all costs if you really want to build a successful business.  Most of this book is actually filled with the most obvious common sense disguised as a \\"new\\" way to look at approaching your business.
B005I64U5C|3.0|I went to the movies to watch the Green Lantern and it gave me mixed results because to me this could have been a great story to start to introduce more characters of the DC Comic Universe to the movies, for the last couple of decades only Superman and Batman have been turned into movies but seems like they are trying to catch up with Marvel since they are already building up the team for the Avengers while DC needs to speed things up if they really want to make a movie with the Justice League in this decade.<br /><br />First, same as many superhero movies coming from the comics you get almost 30 minutes of establishment so everybody will understand the concept of the movie from where the power comes from, the alliance of guardians and how the ring itself select the right person for the job. This way works because it saves you from reading a pile of comics to get the whole idea. Has been done recently with Iron Man, Thor and Capitan America. But this time even though it does show the audience there Hal Jordan comes from, what he does for living and his behavior, it falls short when comes to really establish the relationship with the love interest (Blake Lively) and the evil Hector Hammond never really gave a real fight to our hero and seems like the writers developed a great villain but after he got stronger enough to put up a real fight they just toss it to the garbage by making a magic entrance of the main evil character Parallax into the hangar they are in and that's just sad and flat out stupid. All of this gives us a messy first act with loads of holes to begin with.<br /><br />When Hal Jordan is taken by the ring to its home planet Oa, here comes a ton of CGI that besides giving the audience a Ryan Reynolds in a spandex suit and some hollow \\"training\\" scenes, never really provides more than an obscure world full of aliens of all over the universe with a big green lantern alien that wants to kick Jordan's ass and a red skinned leader that has not trust in the newest addition to the Green Lantern Corps.<br /><br />I think the problems begin with the narration that tell us everything from the very first minute that never ends, instead the director should have shown us everything giving a richer experience skipping the documentary style. The script only slightly touches the romantic relationship between Hal Jordan and Carol Ferris, which could have been a great audience grabber building up empathy the same way Superman and Lois Lane does it, maybe putting her in real danger later on and making us all want the Green Lantern to succeed saving the girl and the end of the movie.<br /><br />When Hal Jordan starts believing and truly learns how to properly use the ring powers the movie is really awesome, Reynolds has a charm that really fits into the character. From that point on is totally worth it and the action scenes even though they are all CGI are well done.<br /><br />But for the teenage boys and young adult demographic for which this movie is intended is going to totally satisfy them since they are not really looking more than a action-filled movie with action sequences and powerful heroes.<br /><br />Rating 6.5/10<br />Because even though is not a masterpiece, it does its job by entertain the audience with action/humor.o the Green Lantern Corps.

140053271X|5.0|New Nook eReader is definitely better than Kindle.  * Expandable storage slot  * Excellent support for open book formats  * Touch screen  * Even smaller and compact.    If you are OK with 6 to 8 hours of battery, go for Nook Color and root it. Refurbished ones costs 150-170$. It is an excellent choice in-between eReaders and Android tablets.    Kindle 3G option is attractive for a tablet, but not an eReader.
B001HN6922|2.0|I saw this with my boyfriend and his son.<br />I loved the first car movie. It was more realize down home charm that reminded me of those old Disney car/house/hat cartoons. But this movie was painful. Far to much high tech fantasy for me and it lost its basic roots. The 7 yr we saw it was liked it but thought the first one was much better as well. And my guy hated it! Very cheesy. The only good point is that the animation was amazing and it kept the main voice actors. Out of all the pixar movies this was my least favorite.

1609611543|5.0|I tested two of Dr. Davis's hypotheses on myself.  I got a $10 blood sugar tester and tested to see how whole wheat bread affects my blood sugar: it goes way up.  And I tested my small LDL particles (the ones that supposedly cause arterial plaque) before and after quitting wheat, and they went down after I quit eating wheat.  I'm not 100% sure wheat is as bad as he says, but since there are plenty of very healthy cultures that don't eat wheat, I can't think of any reason to go back on it.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I thought the reviews were supposed to be for the DVD set and not the tv program.  How can anyone rate the set when it hasn't come out yet?  (Rating the tv program makes it difficult for those of us who like the program and are trying to decide whether or not to buy the DVD set.)  I gave five stars only because I had to give something, and the show was the best how on network television last year.  (Scott Caan was robbed when he didn't get an Emmy bid.)
B000VI6T6U|5.0|I was simply listening to something from Jimi Hendrix on a random TV or news show and thought, I wonder about any Hendrix live DVDs....  So I searched Amazon and found about 3 or 4 that seemed like good choices.  Rather than go with the Woodstock classic or something, I wanted to try this Monterey Pop Festival first because of the history of Jimi's return from success in London on the English music scene.  I'm a typical mid-40s buyer, really nice HDTV widescreen and sound system, to give you a flavor of how I listened to this.  I was absolutely impressed with the historical aspects of the opening sequence of interviews, especially the old footage of the planners, and the current interviews with the Hendrix bass player and drummer.  Then the performance itself, it sounds great on my system in 5.1 (don't be a complainer, its like 44 year old recording) and the video shots are great.  The climactic Wild Thing with guitar on fire and craziness is something to be seen.  I fully recommend getting this DVD.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I wouldn't mind all the new changes to the original trilogy so much if I had the option to also watch the original theatrical versions in HD.  Some believe that the original versions could never possibly be presented on blu-ray in high quality HD, but they're either speaking out of ignorance or are flat-out lying.  The original movies were filmed on 35mm and that has more than enough detail and sharpness for blu-ray.  The restoration costs would be chump change for someone like George Lucas since original 35mm prints still exist in high quality and would likely require a simple scan with minimal digital touch up - nothing difficult involved.  Respected professionals have even offered their services for free in order to get the originals out there, but Mr. Lucas acts like it would be too much trouble.  I loved the original theatrical versions while growing up and would love to be able to watch them in HD.  I really don't get why George Lucas is so ashamed of them and refuses to give us the option to watch them in HD.
0553386794|2.0|One of my fellow nerds in the fantasy/science fiction section cornered me and told me I had to read this book.  Said it was unbelievable.  Starts promisingly with Martin framing this detailed world with seemingly endless story possibilities. Unfortunately that was about the only quality I admired about his writing.  Though somewhat choppy by the constant point of view changes we hold on early and keep waiting for the story to take flight, and waiting, and waiting.  I kept hoping this thing would build to some type of crescendo.  You will feel like you can't put the book down at times, though not for the normal pleasure of it, you need to trudge though the next 4 or 5 chapters to return to the character storyline you were actually interested in.  Why couldn't we just choose 2-3 character point of views? Maybe Eddard, Jon Snow and Tyrion.  Yes there are twists and turns in the book, but after most of them, you're like, ok, is this actually going somewhere?  It was akin to watching reruns of CNN, yes things are happening, but who cares?<br /><br />If you're into fantasy, you all know LOTR.  Tolkien gave his life to those books and it shows.  Sure there are places it bogs down (Barrow Downs, Bombadil, etc.), but think of all the places where you just have to put the book down and shout HUSSSSSSSAHHHH with the hosts of Gondor!  Or the little quips that just make you smile and laugh a little even the 15th time you've read the book.  I freakin cry when Theoden dies!  Why, because even though flawed Tolkien has made us love him, and all the magestic noble characters that fill you with hope and give you something to aspire to in life.  In this book, I found very little of that.  Sure I 'liked' Eddard, Robb, Jon and even Tyrion.  *Spoiler sentence* But come on, the guy we really care about gets his head lopped off.  Did anyone else feel cheated here?  My copy survived the throw across the room, but just barely.<br /><br />Then there's Martin's obsession with sex that's somewhat perplexing.  Did Martin write this while he was in high school?  Do I really need to know the comings and goings of characters semen, how many thrusts it takes to reach climax, etc., ad nauseum.  I came away thinking the author must have had a lot of experience with prostitutes (by the looks of him on the back cover I can see why. Sorry that was below the belt).  What's comical in this book that it is so obviously unnecessary and out of place at times, like when he describes a guy getting out of a pool of water and describing him only in terms of being wet and then describing his unit, or when a girl is putting on perfume on the queen describing the three places she puts in wrists, breast and her 'sex'.  Anyway, none of it really added to the story and the scenes read more like a bad harlequin romance in many parts.<br /><br />Some people will tout the realism, though personally I don't read books for realism.  I know reality, I want to be entertained.  While this was probably 'realistic' to the middle ages, just like the middle ages it was rather plodding and boring 99% of the time and not very entertaining.  Anyway, I love the genre, and love sharing it with friends and family.  There wasn't a whole lot of bang for the 800 page time investment.  Summed up, one interesting significant plot twist, one very minor Husah moments (one trumpet weakly blowing in the background).  Haven't read the others in the series, most likely won't.  There are some characters where I'd like to know what ultimately happens to them, but I think I'll just look it up on Wikipedia or something.  This book was neither uplifting nor a joy to read.  Hope you have a better experience, but I think I'll go read the Hobbit or The Legend of Drizzt, smile and shout, HUSSSSSSAAAAHHHHHH.Did Martin write this while he was in high school?

0062112430|4.0|Not a spoiler. An honest review of the strengths, weaknesses and why you should read it.    What I liked: It grabs you and keeps you going all the way to the end. (It takes a few hours to read and you will not want to put it down.)The prose is beautiful and the plot very interesting. WHAT I LIKE THE MOST: This book has substance. In the middle of the book, I actually started thinking about my life and this book really put a lot of things into perspective. Proper perspective. More so than any self-help book!     What I did not like: Anticlimactic ending. The author just seemed to...get tired, run out of allotted pages or lose creativity toward the end.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Sadly I don't think George Lucas will care what we think, if he did, he might have used some restraint.  There are still serious mistakes INTRODUCED in the CGI additions to the series that he hasn't fixed.  (just look at R2 in Luke's x-wing before entering the atmosphere of Dagobah, and you'll see this horrible CGI error in R2's 'eye', and how the death star could have fired and destroyed all the fighters and the fourth moon because someone decided that the CGI moon should be added to the new shot of the fighters coming towards us, then panning 180 degrees to see the Death Star... 1, 2, 3....  FIRE!  End of series.    George should just remake Star Wars, and leave the originals alone if he wants so many changes.    D
B004EPZ0A2|5.0|For those who didn't think it was exciting enough, leave the \\"evil general\\" cliché edge-of-the-seat excitement to the other superficial movies - I'm glad Contagion was above that.    The intelligent unfolding of the realities of human nature in what would really happen if a deadly epidemic spread through the population was scary and thought provoking enough.  There wasn't one scene in the movie that I couldn't imagine happening if this were real.    It was interesting, well written, great cast and acting, and perfectly told the story.
0765324857|4.0|If you play first person shooters, chances are you've played or seen or heard people exclaim over Bioshock and Bioshock 2, games that attained materpiece status by virtue of excellent gameplay and weapons, a compelling storyline and fascinating characters. This novel by award winning scifi author John Shirley is a fitting prequel to the games, giving the backstory to tycoon industrialist (and Ayn Randian hero) Andrew Ryan and the underwater city he built to escape the confines of law, religion and government -- Rapture. When the player enters the first game, the city is already under the tyranny of lawless splicers as well as several big players who are struggling for control. Splicers are humans who've altered their body chemistry in order to use plasmids -- powers that allow one's body to generate fire, ice, electricity, let one teleport, etc. And plasmids are developed and created using ADAM and EVE which in turn are farmed within the bodies of little girls who are guarded by humans altered for the task -- Big Daddies. It is a complex, fascinating world, and at least half the fun of the game is figuring out who did what to whom and why. This book introduces us to the major players whose actions will eventually lead to the downfall of Ryan's city, and presents a believable story about the events leading up to your entry into the game.<br /><br />The narration shifts among many characters familiar to the player. We learn, for instance, that Ryan wants people to record their experiences for posterity, and when you play the game, you often run across these audiodiary entries, sometimes more than one from the same character, so that as you travel through the game you piece together the stories of multiple men and women who once populated Rapture; some of the stories are heartbreaking, others are horrifying; and with this novel you get backstory on many of these people. While the game itself is amazingly three-dimensional, this book helps flesh it out even more. If you love Bioshock and can barely contain your excitement about the third instalment (due in December 2012), this will scratch that itch. I thought the author did a great job of putting together plausible stories that interweave the storylines found in the game. And while other reviewers seem nonplussed by the short shifting POV chapters, I thought this was a good approach, and I enjoyed the narrative.<br /><br />My problem with the book was the pacing and lack of action. The game is like a ten-ton locomotive barreling through high adrenaline situations; the book is a slow build to a known conclusion, and so lacks the excitement, action and tension of the game. That's to be expected -- a book is not a game. But I still found the book less compelling.<br /><br />The narrative is focused to a large extent on Bill McDonagh, a plumber who is hired by Ryan to come help build Rapture. The action of the novel takes place over 14 years, from Bill's entry onto the project team in 1945 until the time of the first game's beginning, 1959. I found his story quite interesting and his proximity to Ryan makes him an informative narrator. I also really enjoyed running into various characters whose diary entries I'd heard in the games. I wish there's been even more! Personally, I disagree that one has to play the game(s) first in order to enjoy the book. I think it could work either way. Alternatively, one could even play Bioshock 1, then read the book, then play Bioshock 2.

B005CMSDLE|2.0|This movie started out so good. I thought it was building up to some great action scenes, beginning in that underground bunker.  But then they introduced an English hippy family, a whistling German who loves hermaphrodites and midgets, combat boot wearing skinheads, and a bald magician.  It really started going downhill with the introduction of the English hippies.  At about 50 minutes in, I was thinking, please please let this be the last scene with the English hippies.  But no, they kept showing up again, again, and again.  Sadly, that scene in the bunker was the best action scene of the movie.    I'd say the girl that played Hanna was very good.  The guy who played the father was great too.  Both seemed very believable in their parts.   Cate Blanchett?  Well, I have nothing good to say about her performance, definitely a weak point of the movie.  Her fake southern accent was so annoying.  Was it just me or was her accent different in different scenes in the movie?  Maybe that was purposeful?    If you want to watch a good action movie, this isn't it.
B004IFYMWK|1.0|It was known all over DC that Plame was a CIA operative. I spent a week in DC doing research and knew about it... Then a few months later she's 'outed'. The movie is based off her mainly fictional and self-serving account villainizing everyone except herself and her husband; then it becomes a Penn vehicle. Watts did a great job considering what she had to work with but the movie did drag in places and Penn couldn't act out of a wet paper sack. Even disregarding inaccuracies in Plame's own story and even more by the screenplay there was no saving this movie. Wooden and Booring.

B004LWZVZM|5.0|\\"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.\\" - Benjamin Franklin.<br /><br />One could change Benjamin Franklin's quote to read as \\"Those who would give up civil rights to guarantee justice, deserve neither.\\" Injustice in the name of justice serves as the essential underpinning of The American Film Company's debut film, \\"The Conspirator,\\" directed by Robert Redford.<br /><br />\\"The Conspirator\\" is the story of the trial of Mary Surratt who was executed for her role in the conspiracy to assassinate, President Abraham Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward. \\"It is a story nobody knows wrapped up in a story that everyone knows,\\" says Redford.<br /><br />The guilt or innocence of Mary Surratt has been debated among historians since her execution, and will continue to be.  Her complicity in the assassination conspiracy is not the story that screenwriters James Solomon & Gregory Bernstein, nor director Robert Redford set out to tell, but rather they concentrate on her trial as a civilian by a military tribunal.<br /><br />Robin Wright portrays a stoic Mary Surratt who has accepted her fate, the authorities of the United States government having left nothing to chance.  Her silent strength certainly aids the audience in their empathy toward her.  She is originally defended by Reverdy Johnson, a United States Senator from Maryland (played by the always dependable English actor Tom Wilkinson), but for whatever reason Johnson has given the job of Mrs. Surratt's defense to his young associate, and veteran of the Union Army, Frederick Aiken.<br /><br />Aiken, played by Scottish actor James McAvoy, is convinced of Mrs. Surratt's guilt. He is at first openly hostile towards her, but as he comes to realize the fairness of the trial of his client by a military tribunal is a sham.  Mrs. Surratt as the defendant is not allowed to testify on her own behalf, and there is no right to appeal.  Finally he admits to a friend, \\"I don't know whether she is guilty or innocent.\\"<br /><br />The supporting cast is equally as strong as the film's two lead actors; prosecutor Joseph Holt, played by Danny Huston; Edwin M. Stanton, United States Secretary of War, and puppet-master of the trial of the conspirators is sternly played by Kevin Kline; and Mary Surratt's daughter Anna, played by Evan Rachel Wood, at first displays the stoicism of her mother, but gives in to waves of emotion when first her mother is convicted and then taken to the gallows to be hung for her part in the conspiracy.<br /><br />Director Robert Redford and the screenwriters do not dwell on the details of the assassination conspiracy, nor the hunt for Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth.  Neither is the subject of this movie.  But instead they allude to both in montages briefly showing the assassination, and the eventual killing of Booth.<br /><br />One aspect that Redford does concentrate on is the chaos in the street outside Ford's Theater immediately following the assassination, and how they got Lincoln across the street and into the Peterson House, which I found very moving.<br /><br />Of course a story about a trial of a civilian by a military tribunal is as relevant today as it was 145 years ago, and there are plenty of inferences to be made about the political agendas and motives of the film-makers.  We all have political views, and we are lucky enough to be living in the United States where the First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right of freedom of speech and the Fifth Amendment which guarantees due process of law to its citizens.<br /><br />There are, however, a few small historical inaccuracies here and there, but any one going to a movie to expect an historically accurate movie, deserve neither accurate history, nor two hours of entertainment.to a friend, \\"I don't know whether she is guilty or innocent.\\"    The supporting cast is equally as strong as the film's two lead actors; prosecutor Joseph Holt, played by Danny Huston; Edwin M.

B003L77GRO|2.0|I was hoping never to have to write this review, but I think I have officially grown tired of Dexter.  I have been watching Dexter since season 1, and have continued to be impressed at how the show seems to get better each season.  I was especially blown away last season, but have to give this season 2 stars because it was way below average for all of the reasons below.    While there is no denying Julia Stiles' acting ability, her whole storyline just left me flat.  One minute she and Dexter are soul mates, and the next, she is miraculously cured of her \\"dark passenger,\\" literally over night, and she's gone!!! Her storyline was not nearly as interesting as that of Jordan Chase and his friends. Their story could have been developed more and easily been the focus of this season and worthy of the majority of the episodes.    In addition to the problem that I had with the emphasis on Lumen, the relationship with Debra and Quinn was just not believable.  The actor who plays Quinn is just too wimpy looking, and not nearly man enough for Debra.  And what's up with his hair?? It is very distracting, as is the whole Batista/LaGuerta relationship.  Their bickering back and forth and supposedly volatile relationship just doesn't add anything to the show.  Although I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Peter Weller's character and his storyline actually added to the season.    Now comes the hard part.  I think it's time to put Dexter to rest.   We get it; he's a serial killer, struggling to balance a \\"normal\\" life and his urge to kill.  I honestly don't know where else the writers can go with this.  His victim's stories have become more interesting than Dexter's (absolutely loved John Lithgow!) and Dexter has become a supporting player to the other killers. And quite frankly, it's just not believable anymore that he continues to get away with manipulating evidence (the whole situation with Dexter pinning the barrel girl murders on Boyd Fowler has been done time and again onthis show).  The whole \\"code\\" thing is getting a little muddy and I'm just not interested in seeing him set up his kill room anymore.  Been there, done that.    I would love to see the writers concentrate on writing a final season that keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats as Dexter begins to unravel and his whole world comes crashing down.  Bring in a character worthy to bring Dexter down and let the viewers see what happens as Debra comes to the realization that her brother is a murderer.  As much as I love the show, Dexter is a serial killer after all, and I think it's time that he pays!
0439023513|1.0|This final book in the triology was a huge letdown. I started the series because it absolutely consumed my son and I was hoping to convince my daughter to join the club. Sadly, I think Collins really had only one book in her. I was very impressed with Hunger Games. The unexpected twists, the bleak world of Panem, and the charm of the tough resourceful heroine. I really enjoyed talking about it with my son. Book two was like the typical sophomore album, a bit less gripping, but solid. The book at least had me guessing and there were a couple surprises. Mockingjay revealed that Collins had simply run out of ideas. I wish she had quit earlier because this last installment has irreparably tainted my feelings for the whole series. First and foremost, it just doesn't have a good story to enjoy. At times it felt like a weird reissue of medieval hagiography with a bizarre touch of today's sadism. The crimes of humanity are visited upon the body and mind of the suffering Katniss over and over. Instead of a heroine she has become a self-indulgent goth girl living out a dark fantasy of unending suffering. This makes parts of the book very slow, a crime I never thought y.a. fiction was supposed to succumb to. The romance side plot becomes insufferable. The action scenes started to feel like watching someone else play a video game. It is really a pity b/c there was so much promise in the story of the girl from the Seam. Was Collins in a hurry? Was she bored with the story? Others here have mentioned the lame job with the secondary characters and I agree. She made no effort to make them more than props. The only saving grace may be the film. I can't believe I'm saying this but maybe a team of screen writers, a good director, and lots of money will allow someone to clean this up and make it work.

B005H5H3LW|5.0|The best sci-fi movie in quite some time.  It did deviate quite a bit from \\"Quest for Iscandar\\", but at the same time it very much held true, and pulled in elements from Iscandar, Comet Empire as well as the movies like Final Yamato.   This was done in such a way as to pay proper homage to the fan base, and be appealing to new fans as well.   Way emotionally gripping, and heart pounding action.  Kinda annoying about the subtitles though, be nice to have a dubbed version.  :)   (and why can't American studios produce anything close to this good on this small a budget?)    (BTW - For the reviews that made comments about the effects resembling the BSG reboot, I don't think so really.  It held true to the original animation from the 70's and 80's, but with cutting edge effects.  WOW that was cool to see the Battle of Pluto (now Battle of Mars) with that level of detail.   In that regard the BSG reboot resembled Yamato from the 70's and 80's, just with state of the art CGI, which as my buddy keeps telling me was ripped off from Firefly.)

My Mom said her Mother's tears were of sadness but also of hope and we should think of their family until the day she returns to her home.<br /><br />Since that day, I have always kept a place in my heart for Jaycee and her family.  Now, reading her story it is more than remarkable that this woman embodied the strength to not only survive but grow during those eighteen years of captivity.  It is a privilege that she allows us inside her thoughts and her journey.  Reading her journal entries she always remained so positive and made the best she could out of a more then horrific situation, it is truly astounding.  I could feel her hope in each page and even if I did not know that she would be saved, her words even in captivity illustrated she was already a survivor.<br /><br />Jaycee I hope you read these reviews and know that even strangers, like myself, are so proud of you and all you have accomplished and it is so comforting to know that people like you are in the world, helping the world to change every day.  My wish for you is that you will accomplish your entire list of things you want to do in your life and dreams of your future--I know you have accomplished one item from your list for certain, you wrote a best seller.  Thank you for having the courage to share your story with the world and pass on your strength to millions of people, inspiring them in a million different ways.  I know the moon will shine bright down on you and your family for all of your days.
B003M1HN04|5.0|There are few more poignant, striking and emotionally gripping episodes in Dr Who than this one.   Very touching episode.  Well done in my book.
B004LROMSY|4.0|Most of the Acting was decent, the lead actor playing \\"Arthur\\" was a wimp, and frankly if they would have had a better choice at the main character this show might have  made it. The sets were beautiful and the deceptiveness and the politics that came into play are still happening to day at different levels.  Too bad, because I would rather watch a show like  this than half of the \\"Reality TV Crap\\" that is currently on. You can't compare this show to \\"Game of Thrones\\" which is masterpiece by comparisons.     GW
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|After I installed this app, I tried to run it and got a forced close. Then I found my camera stopped working even after power cycled the phone a few times. The stock camera app backs to work as soon as I uninstalled this app. I m using Moto Atrix.
0441018866|5.0|This one stuck with me more than the last 20 books combined. Don't skim the first 50 pages, you have to get that to really...get it. It takes the concept of machine intelligence to another level. You won't think of time the same way again. Great book.
B004UFEJW6|4.0|Not really a thinking mans movie but it was fun to watch. I enjoyed the cinematography. Kurt Russel did a great job acting seeing as he hardly spoke. Director did a good job with the budget given. I cant really compare this to any other movie but I can say that I really enjoyed Star Ship Troopers and Chronicles of Riddick. If you liked those movies chances are you will probably enjoy this movie too.

0553801473|3.0|After reading the first three books I felt that this may be my favorite fantasy series of all time (my favorite book in the genre is Dune, my favorite trilogy is Janny Wurts and Raymond Feist's collaboration as her character interaction compliments his action and adventure).<br /><br />The fourth book however was not good. It may still have better descriptions than many other books in the genre, but I was much disappointed.<br /><br />This book, the fifth in the series, had lower expectations for me. As such, I was not as disappointed in this book, but it still left me wanting more. I have now reread the entire series and realize why.<br /><br />The first book and second book (5-stars) included lots of action and adventure. The third book (4 stars) had noticeably less, but still had some good surprises and seemed to be going somewhere. The fourth book (2.5 stars) seemed to go almost nowhere and had almost no action and adventure. The fifth book (3 stars) also doesn't seem to develop the characters much and just seems to meander along without anything really interesting. It took me about two months to finish the fifth book, while I wanted to finish his first two in a week or less.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin seems like he needs help finding the adventure and fun. I wish he could get some help from R. A. Salvatore, Reymond Feist, or even re-read Tolkien or Herbert to see that action and adventure can be enticing.  George R. R. Martin is great at his prose, but a great book and series needs something other than just words that are put together well.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin also appears to have lost the fire in his writing. His first three books took two years apiece to write. His fourth book took 5 years and this book he promised would be faster, but took six years. He seems more interested in making money (an admirable goal, but a distraction from the series) with his swords and calendars and book signings and conventions and most clearly his politics. I don't count the football as a distraction as that does not take THAT long and is almost a norm. Now he has the TV series as another distraction and due to budgeting that seems to encourage avoiding large scale battles (and action) even more.<br /><br />Just to be clear - I am glad that I bought the E-book. However, I think it could be so much better.
0393327655|5.0|Excellent book and a must read for everyone. If you are looking for a book to read in church - this is it. If I could I would buy everyone I know a copy.     I know of several people who read this book and almost instantly opened their mind and gave up their mythical beliefs - now able to spend the rest of their life un-chained and a free thinker.
B004EPYZQM|3.0|Throughout the entire saga, it has always been about cars and the street racing scene... You had RX-7 (twice), Supra (twice), Skyline GTR 33, Skyline GTR 34 (twice), Evolution (twice), that super sexy Veilside RX-7 in Tokyo Drift, the monster Doge Challenger with the massive blower sticking out, S2000 (twice), Saleen Mustang, Corvette, Doge Viper, super trucks, NSX ,RX-8, Silvia, and 350Z just to name a few and most of these cars were in involved stunts that anyone who claims to be mildly interested in cars will find exciting.... Sadly, this movie does not have that aside from a short drifting sequence which was a bit played out since you had a whole movie dedicated to drifting, right!?    I had much higher expectations for this movie, I'm not saying that it wasn't tolerable, but it was more about the characters Dom and Brian than it was about the cars the street racing scene than the rest of the saga... you could have taken away the Fast & Furious name and it would have worked even better as a movie... because people didn't have those expectations associated with the name.    The movie  is exciting, at times predictable, and I think playing to the drum of Hollywood where everything is Brazil these days, but that's fine too. The addition of all those characters from the entire saga was cool to see but they added little value to resolving the plot... I mean adding so many super drivers didn't do something that say other drivers that Dom could have rustled up in Brazil could have done...    Now... my biggest tiff with this movie... The cars! Sure there were some really cool cars there, like the Classic Vette (a monster of a car!), Ford GT40, Dom's Doge, the Porsche, 350Z, and a few others... but the cars didn't really do much besides that short drift sequence!! Less than 5% of the movie! Really think about it... compare it to the other movies in the saga... there's not much there about the cars themselves... it was more about the characters and resolving a situation /plot!    I'm not going to even discuss the ending with safe stunt... I think others have torn the flesh off of that one enough! But the ending... oh man, how can you just end it with a shot of the GTR and the Doge like that... you had a brand new GTR and you never used it for the movie!!! RETARDS!!! Had they not done that at the end I would have been much happier with this movie!! It should have been more about the cars and the street racing scene!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why doesn't George listen to the Star Wars fans. All we want is the original release with minimal restoration (no additions). I will NOT be supporting this money grab!
B0011HOEY4|4.0|I don't mean that I like the movie 20%, ABSOLUTELY NOT! This is a great gangster movie mixed with drama and emotion! I only gave my review that title because of how Denzel's character takes over the territory and whacks out the previous gangster who held it over 20%!! Wow!<br />Never get to cocky when a man has a gun to your head!<br /><br /> I am a fan of the good old mafia movies, but this movie is slightly different in the sense that Denzel's character has to climb his way to the top of the crime world, but the most enjoyable things about this movie is that it shows even the hardest of criminals as real people with real problems that you can't help find yourself sympathizing with! Yet there iso ne scene where I couldn't help find myself hating Denzel's character where there is an ODed woman on the bed an baby sitting next to her crying... scared because mommy isn't moving anymore!!<br /><br />Not too much blood, gore and murder in this one for a gangster movie, but there are a lot of graphic drug abuse scenes that really made me cringe! (I'm the type of person that isn't really bothered with blood and gore scenes, yet these made me cringe). A pretty graphic nudity scene in there too with the ladies working on processing the heroin! But, the rating on the movie should be a clear warning to all, and now you know what to watch out for.<br /><br />A very touching story, even more so because it is based on true events that took place! Definitely worth adding to your mafia / gangster movie collection.
0307739961|5.0|Book 3, in the Millennium trilogy<br /><br />This series has captivated me from the start, not only that each instalment is a superior pager-turner that manages to draw you into the world of interesting characters it also delivers a story that is riveting and wholly engrossing. 'The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest' is complex, satisfying and clever.<br /><br />The final instalment picks up where the second left off. Lisbeth is in hospital under arrest and fighting for her life in intensive care, while her father, two rooms from her, is being treated for his axe wound to the face. From the start, the story is so crammed with characters, plots and sub-plots it will take a book itself to summarize the main points only.<br /><br />The author loves to takes us on many side trips such as exposing the dirty secrets of the Swedish Secret Service while Lisbeth recuperates from her injuries and contemplates her revenge while waiting for her day in court. The plotting can be convoluted and challenging at times and the wild ride continues with Blomqvist exposing Zalachenco and his contacts with the Swedish government. True to the author's style, he has our heads spinning one curve after another, an endless supply of highs and lows. The many minor characters can give the reader a case of information overload, however, the storyline neatly wraps up the fate of each major player including the fascinating heroine, Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />Regrettably this seems to be the end of the series. I will miss Mr. Larsson's contributions to the world of suspense novels.

B0019N94X6|5.0|I'll keep this short:  the Blu-Ray edition of Scarface looks and sounds stunning.  I may have seen this movie 100 times; I really have no idea.  But I've never seen it, or heard it, like this.<br /><br />I've owned Scarface on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, and even the old RCA CED videodisc, an awful format that produced a very low quality picture.  It's never looked anywhere near this solid, with bold vivid colors and razor-sharp resolution.<br /><br />If you're looking to give your surround sound system a real workout, this is a good choice.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|Being recently introduced to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes' stories, I had to see this movie, and it did not disappoint. There was a modern feel to the super-slueth while at the same time keeping him in his original London timeperiod as dictated by Doyle. Robert Downey jr. was spectacular as Holmes, Jude Law was just as adept at playing Watson, and I would watch Rachael McAdams in anything. The scenery was exceptionally done, as well as a period piece as I have ever seen. I would love to see a second movie come out, as long as it had the same cast.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It was a beautiful day yesterday so what did I do? Sat inside and read this book from cover to cover on my iPad! It is such a well-written book, with engaging characters and plenty of original ideas. The 80's references were fun for me since that was the decade right after High School, and I actually played pretty much every video game mentioned in the book from that era, especially PacMan, Galaga, and Joust. I've read roughly 80 sci-fi books over the last couple of years and this one ranks right up near the top. Warning! You many miss being outside on a nice sunny day! I suggest starting this book when it's raining. :D
0393338827|5.0|The Big Short will be read by high school students 100, 200, years from now.  It will outlast other more detailed but tedious books because it speaks unapologetically from the perspective of questioning outsiders who are the only sane ones stumbling around in a crazy world at the beginning of the 21st century.<br /><br />The style is literary; it flows from the right brain's awareness and questions rather than primarily from the usual dry non-fiction left brain.  From the Prologue, titled \\"Poltergeist,\\" to the bloody end, the tone is one of childlike wonder and adventure in a world where there are no functioning adults:  \\"The willingness of a Wall Street investment bank to pay me hundreds of thousands of dollars to dispense investment advice to grown-ups remains a mystery to me to this day. I was twenty-four...\\"<br /><br />I've read a lot of books about the crisis, but Lewis's explanations are as succinct as a good teacher's.  I would recommend \\"the Big Short\\" as an introduction for friends that don't seem to realize how important it is to understand the financial crisis, as well as for a bird's eye view for those who already know a lot of the details.<br /><br />Many people don't think they can possibly understand what happened and they still walk around in awe of the geniuses who can make so much money.  Others walk around wishing we could get it all back. This book should disabuse anyone of either notion.  (Actually many on Wall Street have not changed; and are living on borrowed time.)<br /><br />I put off reading this delightful book until a year after it came out because I couldn't stomach the idea of making the financial crisis such an enjoyable story.  Nor did I like the idea of humanizing or valorizing anyone that was associated with Wall Street and its betting machine.<br /><br />But Lewis's cast of characters is a perfect entry into what is wrong with the system.  They seem to be the only ones who bother to simply do their homework; they study the facts, then go out to question others because they have so many doubts about their own readings of the facts.  But they keep returning to the facts, over and over.<br /><br />Lewis' chosen characters are ordinary heroes you can identify with: they think, they question, they work hard, they care deeply, they suffer, and they are troubled by their involvement in the mess... they make various choices.  Most importantly, they serve as examples of courage.<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned that Lewis left out the role of Fannie and Freddie.  Lewis is not trying to create a comprehensive analysis but could have brought up these complicated and fraught hybrids in the last chapter, in his humorous way--neither fish nor fowl--not so  much as the final entity to blame, but as a monstrous evolution of the system that we are all now responsible for changing.  Gretchen Morgenson's excellent book about the subject, \\"Reckless Endangerment\\" is well worth reading.<br /><br />I love this book and plan to read it again immediately.  Too many people seem to repeat false ideas or have superficial responses: Who could have known?  The taxpayer made money from the rescue (as if that justifies they craziness, rather than makes it worse).  We need to really get how crazy this all was--or rather, is.because they have so many doubts about their own readings of the facts.  But they keep returning to the facts, over and over.

B0015I2P0Y|5.0|Although they have been in existence for over a decade, I just came across Elbow recently. The album Seldom Seen Kid is just really good music. The only way I can describe Elbow's sound is a cross between Wilco and Radiohead. This album would make a good addition to anyones music library.
B002IVLH60|3.0|If I compare this to most of their other releases this is just ok. There are no great songs here. There are a few good songs but not great. This is more like riot act just ok. The music sounds like they lost it ,Eddie sounds full of energy and great, I wish I could say that for the band. I love pj and did buy this but if your new to this great band start off with something from the 90s.
0061440795|5.0|This novella is nice and short. It is very beautifully written. You might not like the narrator but she knows what she's about. Bonjour Tristesse is deservedly very famous but its immediate impact on French society was because of its immorality. Actually I think the book has real depth. It has a certain sensual quality that makes it really live in your imagination. It's not just a story. You are there in the narrator's world. That's why I give it 5 stars.

B004EPZ08Y|5.0|Wow, okay so Final Destination 5 was an outstanding film, was the most visual and action hair-raising movie. Compared to the 4th film it was a huge upgrade, the cast was believable and no corny or cheesy deaths but more brutal and in your face real type of feeling. I would have to say the 5th entry is by far the best at of the previous 4. If you have not seen it in IMAX 3D i truly recommend you do cause you'll have a mind blowing of fun experiance :)
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why can't the original versions of the films be on these discs? I get that George Lucas thinks that he is enhancing the story by adding all this stuff but some of it is just ridiculous. If you are going to have a changed version of the movies at least release the originals too.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I didn't like when they replaced Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christensen in 2004, now to have dialogue added during the most pivotal point of the entire story is too much tinkering. We know what Vader is thinking, sometimes actions speak louder than words. I will more likely buy the DVD version with the original films and stick with those. I also can't watch the director's cut or new cut of Blade Runner, I grew up watching the original versions and to see a different version now is like trying to change your memory, it's not right. At least with the Blade Runner DVD set you could get many options, either to view the films as they were originally or altered by the director years later. I don't even have a Blu-Ray player or a HDTV, and probably won't buy one for some time, 720 looks good enough to me.    I thought of a good reason why Vader should not say anything as he turns on the Emperor, he is catching him by surprise. If Vader exclaims \\"No\\" it gives the Emperor a few seconds warning that Vader may turn on him.    I know the owners can do want they want with their product. But most people remember how new coke turned out. It must have cost Coca-Cola millions if not more in a huge product screw up, only to revert to the classic formula. As the years went by Coca-Cola has tasted more bitter, and I now drink Pepsi, it tastes sweeter. So the owner can choose to make unprofitable decisions, it is up to them if they choose to lose money.

B004LWZW4C|1.0|The actual film is fantastic, saw it in theaters, thought it was a great prequel to the original trilogy. The reason for my 1 star rating is for the actual Blu-Ray disc. Mine has a noticeable \\"lag\\" in the playback of both the feature film AND the special features. So I got online onto both Screen Rant and X-Men Movies' facebook fan pages, and found that others are experiencing the same issue. I am returning this copy to Wal-Mart for the single disc Blu-Ray without the digital copy disc to see if that one is any better. If not, then I guess i'm just stuck with a movie I cannot enjoy.<br /><br />**UPDATE** 9/15/2011<br /><br />I went back to Wal-Mart and exchanged the 2-disc Blu-Ray set for the single disc Blu-Ray and experienced the exact same playback issues. I have since returned that copy as well for store credit and bought Thor on Blu-Ray instead. I have since read that some guy figured out that when he turned the online connectivity of his player to off, that the disc worked fine. I cannot say if this would have worked on the Playstation 3, so it may very well be worth a shot to those of you who still have the movie. However, even if it does work, i'm of the opinion that I shouldn't have to mess around with my network settings just to play a movie on my PS3. None of my other twenty-something Blu-Ray discs have this problem, so I blame Fox's QC department for this mistake. I will not purchase this movie again, unless Fox releases a statement concerning the problem and what they plan to do about it. If they decide to re-release the film after the problem has been fixed, then I will buy it again.

B004EPZ09S|5.0|I'll just start by saying \\"WOW!\\"  Sure, this movie had a legion of A-listers including an excellent director, yet still this movie exceeded my already high expectations.  While its pace was consistently somewhat slow, the content, in turn, was consistently interesting, socially revealing and gripping.<br /><br /> This movie follows the outbreak of a novel and swiftly lethal virus from patient zero.  With a short incubation period, the highly contagious strain raises the CDC's concern readily ensued by the panic of the masses.  The medical community scrambles in a losing race against time as the numbers of infected and dead patients grow at a staggering pace.  Controversy, capitalism, distrust...all are likely products of slowly-solved epidemics.<br /><br /> The cast flawlessly conveys the very best and worst of human qualities responding to a deteriorating society and economy.  Panic, desperation, fear and altruism are all tactfully delivered with humbling realism.  Adding to the already palpable emotions of the characters was the tension-setting music which, coupled with the concept of this movie, shall haunt my thoughts.  More than once I questioned how I would react in these situations.<br /><br />  This gets a solid \\"A+\\" without question and I imagine that this will be an Academy Award nominee for set design and music, if not more.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|I couldn't get the X-Men disc to play on my Sony blu ray player until I discovered that it was trying to access the internet. Try unplugging your internet connection or turning off the wireless connection by turning off your modem/router and while the modem/router is turned off or unplugged, go to blu-ray data under video and delete/erase the data that this disc put there and then try to play it again. After making sure the modem/router is turned off and the data is erased on the blu ray player then go ahead and take out the blu ray disc and turn off the blu ray disc player and start it up again and put the blu ray back in the player and go ahead and play the blu ray disc. I know it seems like a lot but it's a fairly simple fix and it allows the blu ray to work just fine, at least for me it did. My disc was not working because I allowed it to update and then I learned how to fix this problem from reading a review that was previously written by someone else so thanks to the other person who figured this out first. The issue with the disc I believe is that it tried to access the internet after installing a bad update and then it causes the disc not to load. If this does not work for you then return your movie and get a DVD but this worked for me so that is all I can guarantee.      Simply put:    1) Turn off internet and modem/router  2) Delete/Erase Blu Ray Data from the Blu Ray Player  3) Restart the player with the disc taken out and put the disc back afterwards and try playing the disc again but this time don't update just go right to the play menu  4) You can plug your modem/router back in and use your internet after the movie has started playing
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Whether or not the discerning viewer finds this a complete and well-rounded essay, or laments that it did not somehow manage to smoosh every facet of the financial crisis into its 2 hours, Inside Job is an exceptionally well-produced and eye-opening narrative on the peccadilloes of Wall Street, federal reserve, and even academia chasing their shadows in the name of financial innovation.<br /><br />Its lucidity is intoxicating. Never once have I seen such a simple explanation of the math behind \\"credit default swaps\\", with illustrative graphs and patient narrative (in Matt Damon's voice).<br /><br />It is not preachy. Unlike other efforts such as Michael Moore's \\"[[ASIN:B0030Y11XS Capitalism]]\\", this is not a selective denunciation of highfalutin concepts, nor, thankfully, does it come with jerks of comic relief. The intent here is sincere, specific, focused.<br /><br />And it is unyielding. It was a systemic failure from banks to ratings agencies to federal leadership turning a blind eye as their own personal coffers were not left wanting, and none of them is spared under the microscope.<br /><br />The truly maddening bit: how little has ultimately happened despite all the moralistic rhetoric. Pre-election promises of Obama, \\"to bring the evildoers to book\\", have amounted to squat in the end. In less than a year, he re-appointed the derelict Ben Bernanke. Compensations have remained untouched and in 2010, the bonuses in the financial sector were highest in recent history. All the players are back in business, writing best-selling books, teaching at top universities, or running bailed-out banks that were ordained 'too big to fail'.<br /><br />One wonders if exploring the greed of the average Joneses on the street would have made this analysis richer, more balanced. No finger is pointed at American consumers who speculated on home purchases in order to 'flip' properties to make a quick buck. Even those who borrowed for their own dwelling were flouting every principle of self-control, even if the banks misinformed them. The banks may have been over-extending themselves at insane multiples of 33 (which means a 3% decline in their value would have made them bankrupt -- does not make any sense) but people on the street were gleefully borrowing away too.<br /><br />Anyway, not being able to cover every single perspective is a minor niggle for a 2-hour film that does its job and does it with pincer focus. For its sheer clarity in bringing the scale of the financial debacle to light, it deserves six stars out of five. You are missing something if you haven't watched it yet.<br /><br />Highly recommended viewing.of self-control, even if the banks misinformed them.

0792156684|3.0|We received the DVD very quickly, and it played with no problems. The only thing is it is in wide screen version and I don't particularly like that version, so I will probably never watch it again. I will see if I can get the full screen version.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|for one, the edits are horrible.. thanks for ruining one of the most powerful villains in cinematic history :(    just give us the original versions, or the thx remastered versions of the series (the one released in 97 i think) in blu-ray.. and all this drama will go away and you can get back all those non-sales (like me) and cancelled pre-orders..
B004QSQML8|5.0|I am not quite sure why critics (and many people, apparently who write reviews on Amazon) didn't like the theatrical cut of the film. I will admit that the extended directors cut is better as a film, but, unlike most of the reviewers here, I think the Tangerine Dream soundtrack far surpasses the Goldsmith score. In fact, when I watched the director's cut with both of my sisters (who love it), we were all frustrated because the Goldsmith score is so lifeless. Seeing the film as a child, the Tangerine Dream soundtrack was embedded with the imagery of the movie, and it is still my favorite soundtrack to this day. I just wish the director's cut featured the TaDream score instead of Goldsmith's. That aside, this movie still creates a sense of wonder all of these years later. This is not a film that relies on CGI, but, instead, utilizes incredible sets, costumes and makeup to achieve a very magical effect. The story is very much in line with old European fairytales; in other words, the overall effect is more important than strict plotting. Ridley Scott has always been my favorite director, and I think LEGEND is one of his top 5 films (along with GLADIATOR, ROBIN HOOD, BLADE RUNNER, and ALIEN). If you give in to the magic of the movie, you just might enjoy it.
1594744769|3.0|I thought this book sounded interesting.  It had a slow start, and when I got about half-way into it, I started getting more interested, but then, it got really weird.  I dón't think I would have purchased it if I knew how weird it was going to be.  I thought the photos were interesting since they were for the most part authentic.
B005FRF6PC|3.0|It seems strange to have an autobiography of a player who is in the middle of a stellar career. In fact, Rafael Nadal, is currently ranked #2 in the world and will play the final of the US Open tomorrow. Despite this, I think the book was worth writing, specially the part of the book which focuses on the 2008 Wimbledon final (the best tennis match I've ever seen).    The first two thirds of the book are framed by the 2008 Wimbledon final against Federer. While Nadal narrates his thoughts and analysis on the match, he talks about his family, his team and his past. While the biography information is interesting, it becomes a little repetitive. There are a lot of nice anecdotes, but without a doubt the main thing I cared about was how he approached the game. His thoughts on the final were stellar in that regard.    The last one third of the book is framed by the 2010 US Open final against Djokovic, which was where Nadal completed his grand slam (winning all four grand slams). The thoughts on this match aren't as interesting as the thoughts on the Wimbledon final. Partly because by this point in the book, we already know about Nadal's preparation and the way he focuses on matches. In this section of the book he also talks about how big a blow his parents separation was. It affected his game in 2009.    Overall, the book was worth the read for me. I am a Rafael Nadal fan and I love trying to figure out how players can handle the intense mental and physical strain that professional sports bring. The reason I give it three stars instead of five is that I wasn't too interested in Nadal's team or his family. While there were some nice anecdotes, what excited me about the book was the tennis aspect. I would have preferred a book that just keeps his analysis of the 2008 Wimbledon final.
B004VD3PE0|4.0|Not my normal cup of tea, but a co-worker heaved the book into my chest and declared I **MUST** read it!!  \\"Immediately\\"     I enjoyed the back stories and the other characters.  I really enjoyed how the author jumped back and forth between present day (in the ICU) and the past.  This helped avoid that dreaded first chapter \\"info-dump\\" that is a big pet peeve of mine.  The characters developed slowly, and I did wish that some of my favorite characters had more of the spotlight, as opposed to some of the ancillary characters.      I went into this book with no expectations and I was very pleased.  It's quite short, more of a novella than a novel.  Perfect for occupying a rainy afternoon.

B004EPZ070|5.0|I love this movie.  I find it inspiring, to be completely honest.  I rented it on-demand when it first came out and watched it 4 times.

I should have saved the $10 in on-demand rental charges and just bought the DVD in the first place but I really didn't expect to like it as much as I do.
6305265488|5.0|The real and true story of Cinderella (and the Prince), the details of which were lost over time.  That is what this story purports to tell, narrated by a regent who is the great, great granddaughter of Cinderella!  This is a really, really GOOD, WONDERFUL movie!  Even though I'm seeing it almost 14 years now since it first came out, I'm so glad I happened to take a look at it and didn't miss it!  As story, it is an innovative, in-depth account of the classic fairy-tale/myth that has captured the minds and psyches of females down through the centuries.  This version of the story explores, however, new depths in the minds and characterological make-ups of Cinderella (Her name is Danielle) and the Prince of France who doesn't want to become King (His name is Henry).   Because this story of the young couple's alternating topsy-turvey and turvey-topsey acquaintanceship before marriage involves character growth in the Prince, who gains new human values that replace his previously self-centered, selfish ways, the story is very wholesome and worthwhile.  Although it is still an absorbing Romance, it provides an experience that greatly supercedes the story as mere Romance.  Through the strong and instructive character of the servant Cinderella/Danielle, values such as human kindness and human equality are emphatically expressed and fiercely lived out.  Her dearest friends are servants and she fights to save them from cruel fates.    Danielle is also an exponent of learning, a value which was inculcated by her father's practice of reading to her every night as a child.  The last book her father read to her was \\"Utopia,\\" or, a book about \\"Paradise,\\" and she has greatly treasured this book ever since.  The Paradisical thread in the plot has implications in the fact that we find Henry changing into a new kind of potential King, eager to take on his opportunity through Kingship to do great things for humanity through the inspired management of his Kingdom.  Another new twist tothe old Cinderella plot is that although there are numerous kindly peasant servants, there is no distinct fairy godmother who manifests in order to transform Cinderella for the Ball.  The nearest thing to the godmother in this story, because he adds an outstanding feature to \\"Cinderella's\\" gown, is Leonardo da Vinci.  This amazing story is set up so that  da Vinci, a friend of the Prince, plays a major supporting role!    Another welcome change to the old story is that one of the \\"wicked step-sisters\\" is not so \\"wicked.\\"  There is a lot of very nice humor in this script and one of the funniest scenes for me occurred when this \\"good\\" step-sister was forced by her hard mother to come to the masked Ball wearing a horse head-piece.  However, the girl encounters there a fellow, presumably her future soul mate, who seems to really like horses.  This movie was made in 1998 and yet there was no portrayal of sex or language use that would be considered objectionable by anyone.  What a pleasant relief!  I was so surprised by this!  I could hardly believe it!  I deem this movie a RARE TREASURE.  It's full of beauty; fun; and good, humane, LOVING-AND-LEARNING PRINCIPLES!  In my opinion, both women and men of all ages would enjoy the movie if they had a taste for this sort of thing:  An innocent, fun romance but with depth.  I found the closing statement of the Queen/narrator inaudible toward the end, so I listened to it several times and finally got it all.  She says that the couple did \\"live happily ever after, but, the point IS that they Lived.\\"  This refers back to the introduction of the movie in which the Queen states that Cinderella and the Prince were real people who actually were a part of history, but it is a rather ambiguous remark, maybe meant as something to ponder.  I really LOVE this movie, which makes me laugh and smile.  The story seems a bit silly at first but it \\"takes off\\" pretty soon.  The scenery is beautiful, set in the Perigorde region of France.  I thinkthose castles we see in the film are real.
B0051OZ564|2.0|What would ever prompt someone to write a screenplay that ultimately leaves you feeling depressed? That's never a useful reaction to anything in life, much less a movie. Aren't movies supposed to be entertaining, and therefore not make you want to go drown in a bottle of vodka and eat a heaping helping of narcotics to end the day? Well, they failed with this movie. There is no happy ending, and the beginning tells you why. Gosh I hate this movie. It's right up there with District 9.
B00005J73X|5.0|The Greatest Hits release notwithstanding, this is far and away my favorite Bon Jovi CD. I don't usually like live performances of bands. Dunno why. Something about the shrieking crowds never shutting up in the background ruins it for me. But the Bon Jovi fans on this disc however are remarkably well-behaved compared to those on other bands' live recordings. They even participate and sing certain parts of songs, adding to the listening experience. So while I normally detest live performances, 'One Wild Night' is one I not only don't mind but actually enjoy to the fullest. I listen to it even more than their Greatest Hits CD!    I used to listen to it a lot on my computer over and over while surfing the Web. This was back in the early 2000's. The CD became lost. A bad thing, since it wasn't mine, but my mom's. I had, er, \\"borrowed\\" it from her at the time. Fortunately I was able to get her a replacement here on good old eBay (and an extra one for myself!).

B000002OOY|5.0|Steven Spielberg's blockbuster adaptation of Michael Crichton's bestselling novel about dinosaurs being brought back to life in (then) the 20th century was certainly a milestone with pioneering special effects in both the digital and physical realm. In hindsight, 'Jurassic Park' has its problems and is in hindsight a problematic film, but remains a fun and watchable adventure. What retains its power, though, is John Williams' score.    Williams' work elevates 'Jurassic Park' above the level of simply just another dinosaur movie in a way even Spielberg couldn't. Let's face it, years after the awe of the newfangled CGI effects has worn off, robbing the somewhat paper thin story of its initial novelty, William's score retains its grandeur and power. The main theme, aptly titled Theme from Jurassic Park, is simply a work of musical art outdone only by the Indiana Jones and Star Wars themes. It is slow, and builds as it plays, and is sure to bring a tear to one's eye as they listen to it and recall their first time seeing Spielberg's film in theaters. It did for me, anyway.    This theme is reused several times throughout the soundtrack, as in the film itself, similar to Jerry Goldsmith reusing the main theme in 'Air Force One' at multiple different points in both that film and its soundtrack release. As in 'Air Force One,' however, this piece never gets old and its reuse is not jarring in the slightest.    What is a little jarring, though, is the placement of its first use on the CD. It comes right after the very suspenseful, forbidding sounding Opening Titles and before the equally dread-inspiring Incident at Isla Nublar. In the movie, these two musical pieces run right into one another as the first half of Incident (when the raptor attacks the worker; the second half is from when Ellie and Muldoon find the Explorer later) comes right after the opening credits. Here on the CD, Williams' beautiful main theme comes between these two pieces and sort of disrupts the mood.I'm listening to the spooky Opening Titles and then suddenly Theme from Jurassic Park has me feeling all good and warm inside, only to then be thrust immediately back into a feeling of unease as Incident comes up after Theme closes out.    After that, though, although the tracks are wildly out of chronological order as compared to the movie, this sort of jarring effect caused by sandwiching the wistful main theme between two very suspenseful pieces is not really present although it can be a bit annoying with them being out of order the way they are. At least the final two tracks - T-Rex Rescue & Finale and End Credits - are actually the last pieces of music from the actual movie.    My favorite tracks (besides the main theme) are probably Journey to the Island, with its suitably grand introduction of Isla Nublar as the main characters arrive by helicopter and encounter their first dinosaur, and Dennis Steals the Embryo, a wonderful little bit that uses some James Horner-like wind instruments in some places to underscore Nedry's theft of the embryos. It isn't overblown and is pretty low-key.    All in all this is some of Williams' best work and this CD can be found for any reasonable price here on eBay and elsewhere so it's well worth getting to add to your collection.

It's Bon Jovi. It's two discs. It's got almost all their greatest stuff. Wahoo!    If I have one gripe it is with the \\"Digipak\\" case it comes it. Not only is it too thick to put into my desk's CD holder with my other CD cases, it can't be secured when closed. It's all around kind of flimsy.

B000002LHX|4.0|When the Joker told Lawrence to crank up 'Partyman' on his huge 80's boombox while the Clown Prince of Crime defaced priceless works of art in a Gotham City mueseum, controversy was born. Many Batman fans disliked the Joker's taste in music.    This was then taken up to eleven in the climactic parade sequence wherein the Joker holds his own celebration of his gigantic, insane ego, to the tune of 'Trust.' While many fans may disagree, I feel that these Prince songs fit perfectly well in the world of Batman. Like the Joker himself, they clash with the dark, dreary and serious atmosphere of Gotham City and this is likely why he (and the filmmakers) chose them.    Of the songs featured on this soundtrack, only three were actually used in the film. The aforementioned 'Partyman' in the museum and 'Trust' at the parade, and also 'Scandalous' which plays over the movie's end credits. The others weren't in the movie but somehow fit the theme of Joker mania Prince seemed to be going for. 'Elecric Chair' is pretty fun and 'The Arms of Orion,' wherein Prince is joined by Sheena Easton, is a very moving love song. And finally we have Prince's infamous 'Batdance,' a song so insane even the Joker might raise an eyebrow at it.    All in all, Prince's soundtrack for 'Batman' has been unfairly maligned over the years, but I've always loved it. A class-act release.
0553801473|3.0|Six years after A Feast For Crows indicated Martin had lost control over his narrative, A Dance With Dragons essentially confirms it.<br /><br />This book is by no means as bad as the previous one - Feast was an unmitigated disaster.  This one had some interesting twists, intriguing scenes, fun moments, gritty depictions of a brutal winter campaign, and some entertaining chapters concentrating on Victarion.  But one main purpose of Dance was to concentrate on the stories of three main characters who were completely ignored in Feast: Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen.  Jon's story arc actually has some closure.  Tyrion bounces around in fits and starts, flashes his great wit, and becomes a clown.  Daenerys frets, whines, dawdles, lives a life of luxury while the city she conquered deteriorates into dust, has various bouts of porn sex with a random lover, and makes Rand al'Thor from The Wheel of Time books 6-8 look active, involved and decisive.<br /><br />Other storylines moved forward (Bran), others moved sideways, and yet more players entered into the great game of thrones.  Can Martin resolve his story in just two more books (and less than 11 years to produce them)?  Not at this rate -- he has too many characters just making small moves on an enormous chessboard.  Martin's style doesn't help - he indulges in the Jordanesque trademark of lengthy descriptions of dress and uniform (Martin's indulgence is heraldry and whatever Dany's wearing, Jordan's was women's medieval dresses), when he should take a couple of lessons from Hemingway or Hammett and reduce the background noise so he can move the story forward.  And his editor needs a new pen to clip the extraneous words.<br /><br />All said, better than Feast but not near the quality of books 1-3 and there's too much left unresolved to believe the series can end in 7 books.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was 8 years old when Star Wars 1977 came out and it changed my life. Like most I have hated many of the changes Lucas has made to the original films, some of the changes were decent some were just awful. I was an avid Star Wars collector, but now I feel I wasted my life and money over the years. I have helped Lucas built his empire with my cash, well I can say no more, I was a fool. I am in the process of selling most of my Star Wars collection. I don't want to have anything to do with Star Wars now, he has ruined it for me. After reading all these reviews, I will not be purchasing the Blu-Rays.
B004DMIIUU|3.0|This film is two parts STAR WARS, one part KILL BILL, several parts Shakespearean plays, a whole lota PlayStation, one part UNFORGIVEN with some ZATOICHI thrown in. Surprising it's spawned by the 'anonymous' mind of Kazuari Kirya, the man who wrote/directed GOEMON. Anonymous?     He's only referred to as 'the enterprising director' on GOEMAN's package; He wrote/directed both the international cult sensation CASSHERN (a staggering, horribly beautiful marvel of inscrutability; viewers still argue online what it's about) and GOREMON's rip-roaring clearer-cut love/revenge/action/blood-fest.    In fact the common denominator is a pacifist plea: War/imperialism is wrong, dumb, tragic, wasteful, inhumane, awful. So no surprise theme-wise for two films/one director/writer. (But that's just my interpretation; as said, many people see different messages; see for yourself.)    GOEMON [[ASIN:B004DMIIO6 Goemon [Blu-ray]]]is more 'entertaining' and more clear-cut in its message. Yet it seems far less-sophisticated because its cautionary tale is more spelled out. For me only two elements deducted stars: The writing/editing didn't make it clear enough as to who was who and why they did what they did do. (RATS! I just discovered I could've gotten the BluRay version for a buck more... In DVD images are great; they must be something in BluRay)    Then the english dubbing and subtitles seemed keyed to American teens; like colloquial terms that are cool. Contractions too, Which pertain too to the geysers of blood and rolling heads and bouncing body parts as well. 'Whatever' (yes a popular phrase for kids today), the marketing folk must have been aiming for the youth (gamers?) market. A very, very far cry from CASSHERN[[ASIN:B000UAEBFK Casshern]], which targeted more-sophisticated young adults.    One criteria I put on films is will I see it again and maybe again?    I've seen CASSHERN three or four times and will see it again. The visuals alone merit repeat exposures. And the script isas enigmatic as ever baffled viewers. Maybe that makes GOEMON CASSHERN Lite. (With VERY different scripts, action, graphics)     I may see GOREMON maybe a few times more over the years. But the now too-familiar computer-generated troops charging, exploding enemies (just remembered: combatants used machine guns and grenades to trash one another) get less interesting viewed again and again.    One thing both films offer though is great CGI and art direction. Both are dramatic eye feasts. GOREMON  wins for 'getting it' while CASSHERN wins for intriguing, multi-level thought-provoking conversation-starting concepts, conventional versus contrary. Both films have relative merits worth viewing and re-viewing.

0446582778|3.0|I have read a few Harry Bosch books here and there and have found his character to be very compelling. The mysteries/crimes are nearly always fascinating. Thus, I would say that Michael Connolly is successful in creating a fast, entertaining read.<br /><br />*slight spoiler alert for the end, not revealing names or really details, but some might not want to read*<br /><br />However, while Connolly does try to present what is called in politically-correct terminology \\"a balanced approach\\", I find it frightening that a riot not only ends the book, but kills a cop in a highly violent manner. Throughout the text, the audience has been told that there are two sides to every story. We have been given two perspectives on the idea of riots and why they occur. Bosch never seems to decide between the two which is fine in itself. However, regardless of Bosch's ability to keep both ideas afloat, the author makes his own statement by ending the text in a way that seems to confirm the worst most racist (not my term really because other respected characters suggest that it is racist to argue that the black community in LA will riot and will not be able to process information about this case in a rational manner) notions brought up by the characters.<br /><br />The end is complicated, something the author is good at introducing, and suggests a number of conclusions: a) bad people get bad endings, b) \\"justice\\" is often meted out in some forum whether it is within or without the law, and c) the minority community of LA is self-destructive and without morals (ex. they beat firefighters who are putting out a fire in their neighborhood). Now, I suppose I should acknowledge that this book is a noir book and so there are some conventions that are expected like an overall negative philosophy about 'the system', its corrupting influence, and its ability to exact justice. I see that and as far as this book is 'simply' entertainment (something I don't really believe in), then I get it.<br /><br />Still, all books have ideological messages and while I credit Connolly with being brutally honest about many aspects of law enforcement, crime and power, I find that the ending really undoes what I presume is his attempt to present the world as having two (or more) sides at all times. It is ultimately a raging minority mob who literally blindly reaches out and just 'happens' to grab the bad guy. Sure, we get the bad guy, Bosch is awesome and depressed from worldly knowledge as usual, but in a broader social sense it is a little disturbing the overall message of the text.<br /><br />I'll still read the Harry Bosch books and I'll still 'like' them, but there is more to a book than your own emotional experience.br />Still, all books have ideological messages and while I credit Connolly with being brutally honest about many aspects of law enforcement, crime and power, I find that the ending really undoes what I presume is his attempt to present the world as having two (or more) sides at all times.

The anime was brought up to date with new awasome 3D animations and the 2d animations were refined so that it almost brings the characters to life.

B001V69GB6|5.0|It lost Best Alternative Music Performance to Radiohead's OK Computer in 1998. I'm a big Radiohead fan, always have been, so I figured I'd give this album a listen. WOW...it's reeeeeally good!! Unravel is awesome. Geez...I just don't see how I missed this album. Bjork should have been more popular.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|Great movie! I've shared it with all of my family and friends. I would recommend this movie to people who are interested in the way the brain works. If you are interested in what your life would be like if you were fearless, super-intelligent and endlessly charming.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is seriously my favorite game! sometimes it makes you feel like you are the smartest person ever, and there are others where you stare at the screen and think that it is impossible. worth every penny. I can't say enough good things about this app.
B005BW139E|3.0|MY FAVORITE TRACK....\\"MOTIVATION\\" IS HOT! SHE LED W/ THE PERFECT SINGLE. I WAS HOPING SHE WOULD HAVE A 5 STAR CD BUT ITS NOT QUITE THERE IN MY OPINION. AS ALWAYS I ENJOYED HER COLLABO W/ NELLY. OVERALL THE CD IS DECENT. THERE ARE SOME NICE TRACKS ON THE CD SO I WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. IF YOU LIKED HER CDS IN THE PAST I'M SURE YOU WILL ENJOY THIS CD....MS.KELLY IS TRYING TO BRING IT .....AND SHE DOES ON A FEW TRACKS :-)
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Great series from Showtime! Truly enjoyed watching the whole series with no interruptions ! The Tudors is a must see,  so rich in history.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I'm not sure what's wrong with George Lucas' brain.  Is he so insecure that most people don't like his new modifications that he's chosen to punish all his fans by not including the original theatrical releases?  Pathetic.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|IOS version has many features this does not, and there has been no word of a forthcoming update from Popcap. When that update hits, I'll give this 5 stars.
B0050PYNOY|5.0|Item was received quick and prompt.  The item was exactly what the merchant described it to be.  I would definately buy from this merchant again.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book you have to read it! It was a fast pase book only a couple slow parts in it. There plenty of parts that made me mad or (almost)cry. But a good book evokes emotion and this one definatly did. I read it in one day couldn't put it down. I've read it atleast 5 times its so good. You must read it.
B002VWONB2|5.0|Even though Bogart as Rick never said play it again, still watch and enjoy a classic film. This oneof those the stars didn't want to do but you can't tell by the acting. The best thing about the older movies is they depend on acting, camera work and lighting and not effects. The scenes of the plane landing and taking off prove that, but, doesn't detract. You like and root for the good guys and hate bad guys. It is as should be, in B&W and still as enjoyable to watch and, see why Bogart had the appeal he did and still does have.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|There is a HUGE difference between this and the web-version. Your keyboard becomes TWICE its size, offering letters, numbers, even the integral sign for calculus...all on one screen (no pressing shift, or saying \\"integral of...\\"). I wish they had a screenshot of this, because this alone makes the app worth paying a couple bucks for. Beyond that, the apps look slightly better on a mobile device than the mobile site's results, and the app seems to process commands a split second faster. Note, you DO still have to be connected to the web to use this though.    Anyway, I use this app nearly every day for Chemistry and Calculus homework. If you've used the web version and you like it, you should definitely buy this app. When it comes to my classes, I don't have a tutor or a solution manual. I've got something better. I've got Wolfram Alpha.
B004XC5LP0|4.0|Hero finds problem, boss doesn't believe, disaster strikes, hero saves. Standard formula in disaster films but, it is brought off well in \\"Dante's Peak\\". The video is shot well and the scenery is nice in that area. I watch this often and enjoy each time. For additional info watch the features, it is interesting how they did things. Watch and enjoy for what it is, entertainment without having to do a lot except watch and enjoy.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This even puts the flash versions you find online to shame. I got this as the 'App of the Day' a while back, and now that I've played it, I can honestly say it's worth paying for. This app holds my attention better than any other Android game. It actually has a story you can follow, campaigns, etc. The graphics are beautifully done, and it even has good replay value. Getting a 5-star review from me is HARD, but I have nothing bad to say about this app, and everything about it is top-notch. If you like TD games, you're going to be hooked.
0061537969|5.0|Being an animal lover, I picked this book up because it was in my genre. However, as I started reading it, I quickly realized it was not going to be a typical, tug-at your-heartstrings type of pet book. First of all, the story was brilliantly narrated by the family dog, Enzo, who had an uncanny ability to understand the nuances of his humans, flaws and all. The book was peppered with exacting humor and the all too many harsh realities of the nature of both life and death. I was very much surprised by how much I liked how different this book was and how well the story was crafted.
B004132HZS|5.0|Excellent series.  Updates the \\"pretty stale\\" Sherlock Holmes mythology in a way that Guy Ritchie could only hope to do.  Intelligent, witty but with some serious undertones and some nice twists on the original story.
0316067938|2.0|The story line the author gives us is a lot of rambling.  There is so much more the author could have done with character development. Yes we are inside an 18 year old girls head but please someone give this girl some guidance, something along of a a better Charlie, Alice, Jasper, or even Sam.      I look for strong character development and a good story line which this had neither. There were only a couple of spots in the book that were page turners otherwise it was alot of melodramatic dribble       One of the problems with the story was the two person narrative.  This to me painted the author into a box and limited her narrative and voice.
B002LFIZDG|5.0|Kings of convenience: ABSOLUTELY CONVENIENT! This is the kind of album you can just by its cover: peaceful and beatiful.
030746363X|5.0|The voice of the author is very familiar throughout the book. It makes it very easy to read, even the sciencey parts. Already I have recommended this book to multiple people.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Thanks to modern media, the news of the changes have spread like wildfire. I imagine 20 years ago, many wouldn't have known about these changes until we had bought the set. That $80 can now go to something else more worthy of my money. Maybe I'll buy the blu-ray Blade Runner set, at least THAT director respects his work and his fans to release all versions in one set!
1608870081|5.0|Bought this book as a birthday gift for my boss who is a Harry Potter fanatic and who also loves pop-up books.  She instantly fell in love with it.  She talked about it for days after receiving it.  The intricacy of the pop-ups, but also how sturdy they are, were amazing.  The \\"hidden treasures\\" within the book also add to its value.  Whether you are a Harry Potter fan or buying the book for someone who is - it is definitely a \\"keeper.\\"
B0055PMUSU|5.0|We expected this to be inspirational in the general sense of rising above the odds, but this was so much more. Great family and friend role-modeling, a real depiction of Faith, and, I have to add, good music and cute swimsuits make this movie a must-see. All the surfing footage is awesome to watch and makes you feel like the warm Hawaiian sun is shining on your face.
B001HN694K|5.0|I feel sure that this movie will ultimately be considered a classic and one of Tim Burton's best films.  I absolutely loved it.  It isn't supposed to be a movie of The Lewis Carrol book or a sequel to that.  Burton has said that he wanted to create an emotional connection that he felt was missing in the original book.  Johnny Depp is wonderful as the \\"Hatter\\" and we gain an acceptable explanation for his \\"madness\\" that I felt was very moving.  Mia Wasakowska is well cast as Alice and her performance is brilliant.  A very talented young and beautiful actress that I also enjoyed in the recent version of Jane Eyre.  I will want to see her in what she does in the future.  Helena Carter as the Red Queen is also great and has several hilarious lines, \\"I just love a warm pig belly for my aching feet\\" cracks me up every time.  Crispin Glover is excellent as the campy/creepy Stayne.  We also get \\"Snape\\" as the caterpillar.      The look of this film is amazing if you like Tim Burton's style.  I do, and feel as though this is probably his most beautiful film in many ways.  We get a gorgeous version of the \\"Alice\\" world.  Highly Recommend.
0446672653|5.0|I have always since a child and briefly scuffed over the subject of Reincarnation have always believed in it in a sense but never looked further into the subject...i started reading this online and then decided to order the book because i was soo sucked into it an it would of taken me forever to read it online with two babies in the house. This is an enlightening read, excellent book with first hand experiences for a Psychologist being shared, in which whom didn't believe in this sort of thing until it happened with his first patient Catherine and was the cause for me ordering the book that had Catherine in it, \\"Many Lives, Many Masters\\"
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Overall, what a hilarious, imaginitive story. The two writers also brought a refreshing light-hearted presentation to the roles they played. In roles that are normally negative and full of ignorant stereo-types, they brought light-hearted, likable, sensitive, warm-hearted portrayals.    Mostly, what fun!
0307716511|3.0|Maybe I've read too many mysteries and psychological thrillers, but I found the plot to this novel extremely predictable.  The story of two sisters--one who is missing and the other who returns to London to help locate her missing sister.  After a couple of days, the missing sister is discovered dead.  Was it suicide, or was it murder?  Beatrice believes her sister Tess was murdered, despite what the police are telling her, so she must get to the bottom of it.  Along the way, she confronts her sister's married lover, meets some very unexpected friends of her sister's and unravels the mystery.  I didn't think the writing in this novel was all that strong--it was clunky at times and the dialogue at times seems forced.  I thought the solution to the murder-suicide-whodunnit was quite obvious, frankly.  As I said, maybe I've read too many similar books to be wowed by this one, but I just don't see anything special about Sister.
B000VSBX34|5.0|This product arrived only a day after the earliest expected arrival date and was as wonderful as I hoped it would be! The colors and audio within the movie are gorgeously restored, the packaging was lovely and both discs worked perfectly! Just the shipping speed and packaging alone deserve five stars, but the actual film itself was wonderful.<br /><br />I am only nineteen years old and am a relatively new Beatlemaniac but I knew I just had to have my very own copy of Help! I had previously seen only A Hard Day's Night and while I loved it, I really wanted to see the Fabs in color. The plot of Help! is silly, whimsical and provides a wonderful insight into the personalities of each Beatle. The film also paints a lovely picture of the relationship between the four Beatles, with their inside jokes and teasing of one another. This is the Beatles at their very best, a MUST SEE.<br /><br />And finally, the music. Ahh, the music, seriously, just pick up a copy of the album. We all know that Beatles music is beyond words.
B0015XHQTY|5.0|Sadly San Fran has always been a Freakshow Cesspool of immorality and hippies,in this film with a great opening not because the gullible liberalbroad backtalks to the guy but Because the Man is driving a Beautiful mean sounding Yellow Corvette with Sharp wheels,what follows though is that this time instead of vigilantes gone wild you have a so-called \\"Liberation Army\\",a sad excuse for a Priest(a Radical Sadly The Church as some but they are not True Catholics,Pfelger anyone?)some Black militants who for some reason(Spoiler) are not the ones responsible for running amok but are helping the PoPo(or Five-oh,the Po-lice),then you have the City of Sand Fudge wanting to impose new \\"Diversity\\"Measures such as putting unqualified people or in this case Women not for the skills but for the typical libby causes.  all in all a Great film as usual with Eastwood and Malpaso,and in the end the Hippies lose just like in real life.Get a Job and Conform.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|Though Bryan Singer put his stamp on this movie as an Executive Producer, it's Matthew Vaughn the director (2010's Kick-Ass) who deserves every bit of credit for breathing new life into the X-men comics with this outstanding \\"First Class\\" prequel which takes us back to when Charles Xavier could walk and the X-Men were first coming together.  Magneto and Xavier team up as best friends to combat Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who is pushing for World War III during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Shaw was also responsible for killing Magneto's mother during the holocaust , so Magneto is out for personal revenge.<br /><br />Unlike the other films, this one doesn't suffer from an over the top cast all seeking to hog camera time. We have a smaller concentration of mutants to get wrapped up in and to care about.  Xavier and Raven (Mystique) are growing up as best friends. We meet Hank McCoy (pre-Beast) as a scientist working on Cerebro.  Xavier uses it to seek out and recruit other mutants: Darwin, Angel, Havok, and Banshee. Meanwhile, Shaw already has his own team: Riptide, Azazel, and Emma Frost.<br /><br />Though Bacon was probably my least favorite character as Shaw, his scenes definitely have that 60ish Austin Power feel to them, complete with the ascots which Shaw liked to wear in the comics. His team of mutants are much more interesting and definitely upstage him. Emma Frost was superb!<br /><br />But unlike the earlier films, we actually get to invest in all of the mutants here along with their storylines which have equal screen time.  We see Raven and Xavier as friends.  Raven and McCoy becoming interested in each other as McCoy seeks out a way to hide their deformities.  We see Xavier caring for Erik's well-being, but Erik falling closer to evil.  And most of all, we see the other younger mutants giving themselves nicknames and learning from Professor X how to control their powers. Fans of the early films will enjoy seeing cameos by Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Romijn, which made for a nice tie in.<br /><br />I loved the music throughout which gave the movie a real hip and upbeat feel.  Special effects were amazing.  And as I said before, I didn't feel any of the mutants really upstaged each other.  It was an all around great cast and a great depiction of the early comics, complete with yellow jumpsuits!n.    I loved the music throughout which gave the movie a real hip and upbeat feel.

B005HNMPBM|5.0|Have seen all the X-Men and I enjoyed this one as much as the others.  Great job in keeping with the story line.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|First of all, this item was shipped really quickly. I got it in like a week! Secondly, this movie is amazing! It's an absolutely inspiring tale about one girl's dream to become a pro surfer.<br />It was truly amazing and I loved every second of it. After the movie you can't help but feel really emotional and optimistic. You feel like nothing can really get you down. If this 13 year old girl can get back in the water after the shark attack, then anyone can do anything!<br />What I really loved was that during the credits, they show home footage of the real Bethany Hamilton training to surf with one arm (her brother in the film was taping her the whole time and they show the footage her real life brother shot).<br />I hope I didnt give away too many spoilers.
B001E45XT4|5.0|This will be my second set as most people do not use these headsets as much as I do. As a daily internet broadcaster/podcaster the sound quality is equal to that of $200 sets for far less cost. Buy them or similar models while you can still get them because they work great and handle the beating well. Shipper was awesome also, well packed and shipped promptly.
B003U80I5G|4.0|Though not as intense as some Jane Eyre offerings, and to some perhaps a bit more `Hollywood-ized', I found myself quite partial to this version.  I enjoyed the Suzanna York/George C. Scott pairing, but I also enjoyed them together in 'A Christmas Carol'.  I particularly enjoyed the scoring, which brought John Williams an award nomination
B003Y5HWGI|4.0|There are plenty of other reviews of the seventh season of this show - my one really \\"guilty pleasure\\" of prime time TV (I've watched every episode) so I'll concentrate on the DVD package of this season. The first four discs contain only episodes, which - when the commercials are removed - run about 42 minutes each. Disc five contains four episodes (including the two-part season finale) plus the Bonus features.<br /><br />The \\"Bonuses this time include \\"Desperate For Trivia\\"- a 4 ½ minute rapid-fire segment with the main adult cast members trying to guess answers to questions like \\"what was your address on the show?\\" and \\"what town is Wisteria lane in?\\". I did learn one interesting fact about the titles of each episode (though the episode titles are never shown on the broadcast show).<br /><br />Next up is \\"Growing Up on Wisteria Lane\\", a 10 minute interview segment with the cast of \\"kids\\" who aged on the show. (Remember there was a \\"five-year\\" advance forward in on season.). It was a surprise to see how young Andrew van de Camp once looked. Then comes the requisite \\"blooper reel\\" which only runs four minutes. And the final bonus section is \\"Deleted Scenes\\", of which there are 12, though they only range from 16 seconds (!) to 1-½ minutes. And none would change the plots if inserted.<br /><br />So, if you missed this season or want to relive it, this set will serve that purpose. The bonuses are just \\"so so\\". Now it's time for Season eight - which will be the final season.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
0142402753|5.0|My daughter is two and a half and this by far has been her most favorite book of all times. Fun to read and make up your own tune to the song the Giant sings, teaches a nice lesson about being generous too... Can't say enough about it! Love love love this book!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nearly flawless game,  simple premise and rules but very addictive and well executed from a graphics and playability perspective.  One of Amazon's best deals of the day.
0195073401|4.0|this book is the best for graduates at the moment. however, different chapters were written by different authors and some of them are hard for understanding.
0345529057|5.0|This book is nearly the best. It took me 4 days to finish all 4 books. It is that good. When you buy all 4 of them don't forget to buy the fifth of the series as well. If you like plotting queens, cunning kings, deception, devotion you'll be satisfied.
1439170916|5.0|This book provides the best \\"play-by-play\\" history of cancer therapy I have ever read. Although I am a veterinary oncologist, and hence have interest in this topic, it is an inspiring and uplifting view on where we started, where we are, and where we are going with cancer therapy. A 'must read' for anybody involved in medical sciences,and for anybody battling these dreaded diseases.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Rooted HTC Incredible  I got this as a free app, but now I actually wish to donate to the developer for this. Just to keep the app updated. Currently it only explores the SD card. I can manage it's data with ease. The only additional wants is to be able to play with data in the phone memory.
B004FRY9BU|1.0|A BIG waste of money.  DO NOT PAY EXTRA FOR DIGITAL COPY because WB will hose you!  The customer service is terrible.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Like others have said, if you don't like the ads, put up the. 99 cents!  These series are by far some the best for free and well worth paying for.
B002N8TJ18|5.0|I have always LOVED Enya's music. This is no exception by a long shot. The only thing is, with mine, there was no \\"First of Autumn\\" I believe it was. But that's besides the point. She has AWESOME MUSIC!!!
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I literally stumbled upon Two Steps From Hell last winter when I heard \\"Heart of Courage\\" for the first time in a YouTube video. I had never heard of it and had never really given the concept of \\"trailer music\\" much thought, but it didn't take long for me to become obsessed! The Invincible album had just recently been released on iTunes at the time so I was able to buy many of the songs. I keep discovering more today and can't wait until the next public release ablum! This music gives me a purpose in life -- no matter what I'm doing when it's playing I feel like I'm accomplishing something!
0307279189|5.0|Wow.  One of the best books I have read in a long, long time.  Even if you are not a runner, this book will be interesting for you.  It reads like it's fiction and presents a truly amazing story centered around a tribe native to Mexico, who are built for running like nobody left on earth.  This book provides insight on the physical evolution of humans and explains how humans were initially hunters who used running as their weapon.  If you are a runner, you will love this book even more as it presents running in a way you have probably never looked at it before.  The book is filled with some useful tips and it will certainly open your eyes to some new perspectives on running.  Overall, this book is a great read for runners and non-runners alike and I honestly can't recommend it enough.  Rarely do I reread books - I definitely think I'll read this one a second time.
B005MF1O5S|3.0|Compared to the River storyline or even the, hopefully, hunt for the Silence or what is that question, this is a filler.  More like that pirate ship episode from Season 5 than anything else.  No relationship to anything else.  No movement on anything.  No real villains.  The Amy character is good in two roles but there is just no \\"there\\" there.    The preview for the next episode seems like that as well.      I don't understand how one can ignore the importance of the Hitler episode and then go on as if nothing happened.  I'd be interested in knowing that dang question or trying to find out who or what made the TARDIS explode in the first place.      Perhaps the doctor is content to play around, knowing he will die at 1109 years of age.  But I'm not even sure of that since he is still wearing that weird long coat, which has to be significant.  It has to be some kind of clue.  This is also about \\"duplicates\\" in time so perhaps it is somehow related to The silence episode.  He also said two Amies can't be in the TARDIS and presumably two Doctors can't be either.  So, perhaps this is a clone and the real doctor is somewhere else, trying to figure out what the question is.     Eh!  I was looking forward to watching it but was disappointed once I did.  It was kinda boring.  I was hoping for more.  There is some good action.  Amy kicks major butt and they did some amazing visuals as Amy talks to herself.  Overall, okay.  Definitely not up to the other episodes.  My excitement to see the next episode is dimmed since it seems to ignore what, is to me, the most interesting storyline:  The Silence.  The Question.  River Song.  Who kills the Doctor?  Is it the actual Doctor that dies or a clone or something else?
B003TTIXOO|4.0|Season 5 ends with a dramatic cliffhanger, so I'm sure everyone watching this series on Amazon REALLY appreciates Amazon TOTALLY ruining the suspense with the helpful phrase: \\"dealing with SPOILER's death\\" right there in the description of Season 6.    C'mon, Amazon. Get your act together!
B0058RCVYS|5.0|Just love Danish films, After the Wedding is highly recommend.  I have watched Mads in Prague also, and he is excellent.  I am currently trying hoping to get Amazon to stream Open Hearts, which also gets high reviews.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I thought the premise was great, and anything with Wash.... er... Alan Tudyk in it is a thing of beauty.  I was hesitant about the $10.00 rental price, but I figure that I would have spent at least that to watch it in theaters, so it was a fair trade in the end.
0553801473|2.0|I'll be quick about this.  Is it a fun read?  In some ways, yes.  On a page-by-page basis, Martin is as good an author as you're likely to ever find in this genre.<br /><br />HOWEVER.  Books, and this may be even more true for long serial stories, need a cohesive structure that allows the storyline to develop, to grow, and then to eventually reach climax and resolution.  It's very similar to music composition.  Readers can only absorb so many plot threads and deepening complexities and left turns into new sub-plots before the work becomes a tiresome mess.  Martin has crossed that line.<br /><br />He may be able to salvage this series, but it will mean getting back on track and starting to bring the critical plot threads together into some semblance of a cohesive story arc that builds momentum towards a finish.  And it doesn't matter to me how many books that takes.  But this reader will not be purchasing another in this series without some assurance that Martin is willing and capable of delivering the goods.

B003L77GRY|2.0|I almost returned my Blu Ray discs to the store because I thought there was some form of error because none of the discs would load.  After researching online, I found others had this problem because Showtime forces the discs to go to BD-Live first, instead of just the normal disc screen to watch the episodes.    What an extremely annoying and frustrating way to structure a disc.  I will never buy another Showtime blu ray until they change this obnoxious policy.    I'm beyond frustrated that I had to spend 30 minutes online researching just to find out that the disc would eventually load if I just stared at a blank screen for 15 minutes.    Dexter is awesome, but Showtime gets an F for this.
1439181780|5.0|Love, Love, Love, Love, Love...need I say more.  I have read many books and this drives the simplicity of Love to a Home Run Status.  I am so HAPPY that this book is written. I have overcome so many silly issues in relationships using the principles of this book.  My life has opened up to a whole new level. I am always one that loves life. Now with the Secrets in THE POWER - I love life and embrace life and am very excited about living in the moment and creating relationships beyond my wildest dreams.
0143034901|5.0|A fascinating story told with tremendous erudition and verve. There are quotable quotes on almost every page.<br />The complex plot, unique characters, descriptions and aphoristic remarks all rate 5 stars.<br />Riveting to the end.<br /><br />Caveats: It portrays a very dark almost cynical view of life without happy endings.  Parts resemble a gothic horror thriller.<br />The author has an imagination I can only compare to Dumas, but unlike Dumas, Zafon often goes over the top.<br />(One can love extremely rich food, but a chef who puts every spice in his cabinet into the stew will choke the most adventureous palate.)<br />The reader starts to suspend disbelief and thinks about the author's method: His immagination is in overdrive and he seems to throw every outrageous idea that comes to his mind onto the page.<br /><br />I will highly recommend.  But I will embark on a strict and lengthy diet before I will try Zafon's next novel.
1416972250|4.0|I read this series and really enjoyed it.  It is well written and fun to read but it really frosts me to have the Kindle edition cost as much as 4-5 bucks MORE than the deluxe paperback/hardcover versions.  This really frosts me!
0143035711|5.0|I just came upon this book and read it in two days. I had many friends who served in Vietnam (My service preceded the war) and have read a number of books about it. This is a terrific book. It describes his decision to enter the Army warrant officer pilot program in 1964. He was sent to Vietnam in 1965 and served a one year tour. This was early in the LBJ ordered buildup when the war changed from a Special Forces advisory role to the full-on US takeover of the war. It was a traumatic experience, as anyone would expect. One of my friends was a \\"dustoff\\" helo pilot in Vietnam but he never talked about his experiences. They flew all medevac missions and he became very close friends with a doctor (Another friend of mine) who was there at the same place and time.<br /><br />For those who are fans of WEB Griffin's books on Army Aviation, [[ASIN:0515090212 The Lieutenants: Brotherhood of War]] and the rest of the series, this would fit in with [[ASIN:0515100536 The Aviators (Brotherhood of War, Book 8)]] as they are about the same period. The author, as in the case of many of his compatriots, had his doubts about the whole thing and still did his duty, accepting appalling risks sometimes to pick up surrounded platoons and wounded. It is excellent and reads like one of Griffin's novels except for the self doubts of the citizen-soldier.
B002N1AERI|5.0|Most fantastic music for driving.<br />So powerful and inspiring that usually when I listened to it, I drove faster than 90 mph.<br />Personally, I think Epica is better than nighwish.

B0051T47NQ|5.0|More films should be this enjoyable.  I really appreciated its abandon, and its integrity. It's like a good roller-coaster - diverting, exciting and a fantasy fulfilled. Unplug your expectations, and just enjoy the ride.  It's great.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|So many reviewers have already posted comments on \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,\\" so I don't think I need to summarize the storyline here. Picking up the story where the slow and uneven \\"Part 1\\" left off, the final installment marks the end of the Harry Potter series spanning more than a decade, with a balanced, appropriate climax.    The film's pace is faster than the previous chapter, focusing on the actions of the three main characters Harry, Ron and Hermione, and their desperate search for the remaining Horcruxes. The battle scenes have become more spectacular and powerful with fantastic use of special effects and effective editing.     Watching \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2\\" is like attending a school reunion. Many (if not all) characters who appeared in the series will come back. It's nice to meet Gary Oldman again, though his time is very brief. Blink your eyes and you will miss Emma Thompson.     With exciting actions, stunning visuals and fine production designs, the second \\"Deathly Hallows\\" is a fitting grand finale to the long-running series that started in 2001, wrapping up the long story with a pleasing coda.
0062060554|4.0|The book has a fairly simple premise... each day she wakes, reads her journal that she has been keeping in secret, and then remembers or discovers a little more about her life and writes the additional information in the journal. I found myself both being bored and compelled to read more to see what she discovers next. I was always wondering who the villain was going to be: the doctor, her husband, or someone else. I can understand some of the reviewers comments that the journal entries where too detailed to be realistic in this setting, but I felt it was okay and understood it to be the author creating a narrative and \\"fleshing\\" out her journal entries. The book was a very easy read (for me, that's good). I read the last third of the book in a couple of hours (take that as a positive). For me, this part was the most compelling. I felt that the ending was climatic, exciting and disappointing. After reading the final few pages, I did not see how it was possible that the events supporting the ending could have taken place. How did the photographs that support the ending take place?
0316069353|3.0|I have read some of the reviews and each is entitled to their on openion. I love Michael Connelly. I have read every book he has written, to my knowledge. I did not really like this one. I like the Mickey Haller character and have enjoyed the other books about him but not this one. Some parts of the book were very good, the beginning and the end were good. I like the Cisco character, and his very good buddies. A lot of the book was in the court room. I actually went to sleep a couple of times trying to read while getting through page after page of questions from the two attornies. Sorry but it was just not as enjoyable, to me, as other Connelly books.
0061784788|2.0|After reading my first Rollins novel \\"Altar of Eden\\", I quickly became a big fan.  Followed that up with \\"Excavation\\" and I was hooked.  So when I saw the promos for \\"The Devil Colony\\" I was eagerly awaiting it's release.  That being said, I'm sorry to report that for me it didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />While many will cite criticisms based on believability or the accuracy of scientific information, neither of those influenced my opinion.  Also, being my first Sigma story (although I did read \\"The Skeleton Key\\" prequel), I had no problem or preconceived notions about the characters.<br /><br />Simply put, the other novels kept me turning the pages, losing sleep wanting to find out what happens next! While there were moments, I found the majority of \\"The Devil Colony\\" moving at a much slower pace.  Somewhat choppy, there were several times I ended up having to go back and re-reference earlier parts of the story to get back on track.  Also, maybe it's just me, but I never really felt I got the answers to all the questions Mr. Rollins posed in the online build-up to it's release.<br /><br />I'm still a Rollins fan and look forward to reading some of his earlier as well as upcoming work.  I just feel that \\"The Devil Colony\\" left me unsatisfied, something I haven't experienced before from an author who I really enjoy.
1594202842|3.0|I have been wanting to read this book for a long time and finally got hold of it yesterday. Finished reading it in less than 12 hours.     I really like the fact that Ms Chua does not hold anything back. She is as harsh on herself as she is on the people around her. The book is honest, flows easily and moves fast.     My opinion of the book is that it does not offer views on Chinese or Western parenting styles. It seems like an apology to her daughters. She not only wants her daughters to forgive her but she wants the whole world to read and forgive her. I sensed extreme guilt and self doubt on her parenting tactic.     If the reader wants to learn about parenting styles etc then this book is not for them. If they want a good book to curl up with then this makes the cut.     I am curious to find out how Jed supported her through all this. Is there a second book coming along those lines?
B004FECNIO|5.0|This is an amazing film you may not be open to.  I hope you can appreciate it; so much is so right. It offers many observations about what it is to be human; I can't help but believe that, in the end, David died, and became a 'real boy.' This is a beautiful film about humanity and love.    My son had written this, and I believe it was inspired by Gigolo Joe's last words...    Stimulate response from wind, Answered in a song:  I am the blown  The lost  The found and held dearly  The forgotten and fondly remembered  I am the gale and gust  The ebb  The flow  I am a known unknown  The motor and brake  I am the soul of autumn  Relief or ruin of summer  The force of winter  The hope of spring  I am power and powerlessness  The resigned  I am prayers answered  I am curses muttered  The voice of the forest  The sovereign of the sandstorm  I am consolation  I am destruction  I am  I was  I will be
B004EPYZZI|4.0|This a true story of courage and faith by a young girl who's life was suddenly changed. Her journey is well played From Bethany's book by Annasophia Robb. I   recommend this movie or book to anyone from age 5 and up.    Michael and Pam
B0051QO4QY|5.0|While I was at first skeptical of the album's premise, I was immediately sold once I listened to it. Most of the songs are beautiful, and quite catchy. Don't stray away from the songs that aren't singles either, I think that two of the best tracks are \\"Electric Chapel\\" and \\"Bloody Mary,\\" both of which haven't been released as singles. Altogether a good, cohesive album!
B0045JEPXU|5.0|LOVE EVERY SONG ON THE CD. IT'S AWESOME! WHAT A GREAT COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BY PITBULL AND ALL INVOLVED. WOULD RECOMMEND YOU PURCHASE THIS CD.
B004SIPA4G|4.0|I have been waiting to see the extended uncut version of Sin City since it's release and it is awesome! It is definately the way to go because it makes a truly amazing movie even better! The presentation in Blu-ray is also stunning on my tv. My only complaint is that the extended version dvd has the parts of the movie separated and not in the same order as the movie version. Also there is a short pause in the scene when a extended version is being downloaded that is annoying. I thought it would be just like the movie version but with the extended scenes added to it. But instead you get separted parts of the movie with movie credits after each part. This breaks up the contiunity of the movie for me. It's not a deal breaker but definately could be better! I bought this through Amazon and my buying experience was smooth. I got the dvd in 7 days standard delivery. A must have for Robert Rodriguez directed films fans! This movies stimlates human emotions like no other movie I can rememeber!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|this is a great movie of being in love with someone who is with someone else. so happy it ended the way it did too.
1451629184|5.0|I read this in a day, it was a page turner.  Some who have read it complain of her detailed account of her animals, but that is what was going on in her life.  Those animals were her only connection, they did not judge, and provided unconditional love.  The description of her abuse was brief but very bold.  She did not need to go into grave detail the entire book about the sexual abuse, you knew it was there.  I am sure it was very difficult for her to recall and write those horrible things that monster did to her.    Jaycee, I want you to know that I think you are fantastic!  I wish for you nothing but happiness, love, and a very bright future!
0393338398|4.0|a revelation. My Pittsburgh Pirates would be wise to try to copy some of the strategies of the Oakland A's of ten years ago. Now that the movie version is almost here, I hope fans who missed the book when it first came out, as I did, will go find a copy. The middle third is pretty dry statistical reading, but the opening and closing thirds are quite satisfying. For anyone who dreamed of being good at baseball despite being short, beefy, too thin, too slow, no good on defense, or great in fielding but poor at hitting, this is quite fascinating.
B0055B0MIO|5.0|In Waves is an awesome album, definetly worth the buy. I would recommend getting the special addition, my partner bought the normal addition from the shops here at home and mine had more songs and little extras on it. He even paid more for his then i did for the special addition on here!
1932100660|5.0|Excellent source of nutritional information.  Highly reconnended for anyone who is interested.  I have read it twice, and have given copies to three people.
B000UE29SW|1.0|I already reviewed this item.  The book was used.  It was written in on numerous pages. It was highlighted on some pages.  Red pen or pencil showed on other pages. Plus writing was added in pen on other pages. The book was a mess.  You should have received my review because I was asked to review the book about a week ago.
0749336072|5.0|The book was in the exact condition as stated and got to me within two days of ordering.  Very fast turn around time.  Would definitely use them again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game! I am a breast feeding mom, this is easy one handed and keeps me awake. Thought provoking and fun. Haven't gotten through too many levels, hope rest of hand is as good!
B003CR9BYE|5.0|Got the package within days of the order. Great service and the product to match. Sinatra and Jobim, I can't match this anywhere.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was really excited when I pre-ordered this many months ago in the hope that they were coming out with the original movies.  After seeing that they made more additions to the movies I had to cancel it. It is too bad they are trying to fix or improve something that wasn't broken to begin with.  I'll buy it if they ever release them in the original versions.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Seriously?  Just throw my childhood in a blender and be done with it.  Just be... done... with... it!  Is that 20 words, enough to give my 1 star???
B004LP601S|5.0|I fricking love this album, its great! You should deffinately get it, you will love it if you like this kinda of music.
0439023491|5.0|Did I think it was possible to have multiple heart attacks while reading this book? No. Did it happen? Hell Yeah! I was completely taken back by the emotions swirling in this book. Half the time I kept saying,\\" Katniss, What are you doing?\\" in a frustrated voice.<br /><br />Katniss has won and all seems okay. Except that she has started an uprising and The Capitol is not okay with that. With those consequences they want Katniss to play it off. Make it seem like she really is in love with Peeta. What Katniss discovers, is something she known all along.<br /><br />I think this book should be called Playing with Fire. In this book Katniss make so many risky decisions, I was always on my feet,....literally. I could not sit and read this. In fact I was pacing while reading this book. Everything in this book was written perfectly. Every line, every detail had me spinning and waiting  for more. Ms. Collins made it possible for me to not only envision what I was reading, but had me feeling everything in it too. She left nothing out and everything she put in was just delicious.<br /><br />Th ending was just awesome. It course reached all my expectations and  left me hanging, only wanting more. Ms. Collins has once again WOWed me. I could not be any happier. I am glad that I started to read this book  late in the series. It only leave me with just a few days away from the Mocking Jay release! *Squeal*<br /><br />If you have not read this book, you should totally jump on the band wagon and do so. You will not be disappointed. The only questions left to ask after you read this is, What team are you on???
0812550706|4.0|This is a great book for teens and pre-teens!  I read it first then convinced my younger brother to read it, which he did grudgingly, but by the end of the book he was asking for the second!  I would (and am)suggest this book for almost any age. Besides his brother bullying him, this book is acceptable for children 9-10 and up. This mostly depends on your childs reading ability...  Great book, but it is better in paper.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|[[ASIN:B000I5XOW8 The Fugitive [Blu-ray]]]    I Don't Yet Have The Sufficient Blu-Ray Viewing Experience Or Knowledge,That Previous Reviewers Of THIS Particular Blu-Ray Obviously Have.    But As HARD As I Tried, I Simply Couldn't See ANY Difference In This Blu-Ray Transfer Of A TRULY Great (& Smart!!), Suspense Movie.    Seeing Scratches Right At The Very Beginning With The Warners Logo, Certainly Didn't Help. And The Less Said About The VERY Ridiculous \\"Phone Call\\" Featurette Between Director Davis & Tommy Lee Jones (Interspersed With A Clip Of A Grouchy-Acting Harrison Ford), The Better!!    I Can See Why, This Blu-Ray Has Been Marked Down;But Won't Go Too Far In My Critique Here, Considering It Is A SURE Bet That Warners Is Probably Prepping A 20th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray With ALL The Trimmings, For 2013!!     My Only Hope Is, That They'll FINALLY Decide Whether To Keep In, Or Remove, The Extra Who Pops His Head In At The End Of The Train-Wreck Scene (Kept It IN, Here)!!
B005COO1X6|3.0|A decent yarn by King, but a little brief to be engaging. Nevertheless, it's a fun romp. Recommended for King completists, but not people looking to pass an entire night.
0765365278|5.0|Great read loved it from start to finish  This book got better with each page I read  A must have
0439023483|5.0|Have I been bitten by this book? Can someone give me a HELL YES! From the first glimpse of Katniss, I was hooked. Ensnared so tightly that I had no choice but to finish the book right now! No matter what. And then when I reached the part that said,\\" Ladies and Gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin\\" my heart raced all the way through.<br /><br />This book was how can I say.....breath taking. I have not read a book that has  \\"WOW\\"ed me. And this book did. They very thought of a game played so viciously just for the entertainment of people grabbed me. I had not read something like this before.<br /><br />Katniss is a survivor. After he father passed she took it upon herself, to help the survival of her family. She learn to hunt, brought food, took care of her mother, etc. When her sister get chosen for The Hunger Games Katniss makes no hesitation of stepping in for her sister, taking her place, along the side of  Peeta. From there, they are thrown into a while hunt to save their lives and make it out alive.<br /><br />I love the romance connection between this two and how is blossomed. Everything was perfect. The plot, the drama, and the action. OMG! The action was just breath taking. Every turn, every emotion, I felt along side with Katniss. She did everything she could to survive.<br /><br />Ms. Collins, I tip my hat to you. You have made my day. I enjoyed your writing. Your writing was brilliant and you detailed everything perfectly.
B005G48Y58|1.0|This movie is nothing new.  I guess this could be considered a good movie if you were desperate to see Jason Bourne played by a 80 pound girl.  This is nothing but Hollywood drivel.  I thought it had been directed by Michael Bay until I saw the credits.
0439023521|5.0|Hunger Games is a really great book for people of varying ages. Quick read and truly a page-turner. Also the second book to the sequel is just as good!
0894803123|5.0|I love this book!  It has a great story in the beginning of how they got their company started and their different successes and failures.  And then the recipes start.  They make everything so simple - start with a simple base, then dress it up from there!  Everything that I have made out of here has been absolutely fabulous - even the cookie's and the brownies (they give the recipes for these in the back).  Definitely worth it for someone who wants quick and easy recipes for their home ice-cream makers :-)
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Love this game, as I do all the Angry Birds games.  As frustrating as they can be, I have beaten all the current levels and am very impatient for the next updates!  Let's go, rovio, step up the pace, make some harder levels to keep us busy at least until the next update!  Great games, fun and addictive!
B003L77GGK|4.0|I have to agree with a lot of people, this season wasn't as good as the others. Some episodes just sucked. That being said, there were a few episodes in this season that were awesome, and I still say they've got some of the best lighting/directing on TV. I wish they'd do a bit less of the world saving and more of the classic older-style monster hunting. For me, they started slipping in season five. Oh well, its still good TV compared to most of what's offered.    I just have one complaint about this season and its a writer complaint. Episode 21, Bobby is explaining to Dean who HP Lovecraft is and he says, \\"At the Mountains of Madness, The Call of Cthulhu?\\" to list some story titles Dean might recognize. Dean's answer is a questioning look and a dismissal. The writer missed the fact that Call of Cthulhu is also the name of a Metallica song. Dean, who frequently uses 'James Hetfield' as an alias, should have caught that and said something like, \\"You mean like Metallica? Great song!\\" Maybe have that song playing in the background at some point.  Tsk tsk tsk. Shame on you writer. Any time you mention a horror/fantasy title, cross-reference it with the metal music.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|Over the years I have watched other comic book heroes come to life and wondered when and how they could bring Green Lantern to the screen. To generate the mental constructs without looking cheesy always seemed to be the biggest obstacle. Well this movie was mostly faithful to the story line. The constructs were excellent. The aliens in the corp were true to story. This was an excellent origins story, I hope there will be a sequel. The GL suit was a bit overdone, a faint green glow might have been more true to form. An a note to the \\"professional reviewers\\" it's not a magic ring it is tech, it shows a lack of grasp on what you are reviewing.
1594744769|4.0|When i started reading it, it felt slow and boring, but it picks up, and you end falling in love with the story. Great book, buy it.
0307477479|1.0|Irritating, annoying, dis-jointed, hard to care about any of these self absorbed characters at least Drew became a physician and helped some people. One of the worst books I ever read
0439796644|2.0|I'm clearly the only person in the world who doesn't like, doesn't get, this book.<br /><br />The horse is a Gary Stu (See here if you don't know what one of those is  [...]) - he knows everything, from what guns and cannons are, to what wire is and what it can do, the terms for everythng in his world, including politics and the type of bit in his mouth.<br /><br />I'm used to anthropomorphic animals, and have been since I was born--but Joey should be dressed up in a waistcoat and walking on his hind legs because he has the human intelligence of one of the pigs from Animal Farm or Benjamin Bunny.<br /><br />When you compare this style of \\"horse point of view\\" with Black Beauty or something well done like Watership Down, you can see the failings. In Watership Down, the rabbits didn't understand CONCEPTS such as \\"a road\\" - they see a hard river that smells wrong - and elil run up and down the road, not hunting the rabbits, but as deadly as anything else in their world. Whilst they learn how to cope with the road, they never understand it. But Joey understands everything, both ideas and concepts--and that's just irritating.<br /><br />He knows English, despite having no horse communication at all - then when he's abroad, he understands German and French!  someone has said that this aspect of it emphasises the anti-war message, but I'm afraid I just don't get that at all.<br /><br />A horse is a fight or flight animal--its instinct is to run away and I'm afraid that MM doesn't represent a horse at all in this book. He's simply telling the story of a man in a horse's body, and really--it would have been a better book if he'd told it from the point of view of a man.<br /><br />I understand that I'm one lone voice in the wilderness here, though, so I doubt anyone will agree with me.
B003XQ2VOG|5.0|I was a Irwin Allen fan before but now I am totally sold on him.  I paid less at Cosco but this is a great deal for the money.  The Lost World which I was not expecting much from almost looks like it was filmed today and has a lizard/aligator or croc fight that could never be done today as they really go at each other.  The animal rights people would crap their underware.  In fact if you know one show this to them and have a laugh.  Where else can you see David Hedison get hit on the head with an umbrella by Claude Rains?  Fantastic.  All are first rate films.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I had a blast reading this book.  From the 80's Nostalgia to the very cool futuristic world that conducts most of its business in a virtual environment, I was completely engrossed.  I won't be surprised to see this one turn into a movie.  Let's hope the author finds a way to make a sequel or two, or three...
0300169787|5.0|This book is a mind-blowing visual \\"Grand-Tour\\". A fitting tribute to an awesome artist who sadly went long  before he should have. The book is chock-full of large, coloured & detailed photos. I agree with another reveiwer that you can slip into this book for hours and also the reveiwer waiting for a 1000 page work on his entire career...This will suffice nicely. The quality of the book is outstanding & you wouldn't be disapointed receiving even at a much more expensive price tag...In short if you love avant guarde & even if you don't buy the book anyway...Strangely I think it will appeal to both sides of the fence.   on a somber note, I hope the poor man is at peace. It's a shame he is gone, apart from the human tragedy of it all is the loss of a phenomenal talent....Would have been interesting to see where his journey would have taken us...
B0001US8FI|5.0|This man is a genius! It's a shame that his life was cut short when he was beginning to sky-rocket in popularity. He does have a faithful following, and I believe this collection will make you realize why.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|Inside Job is a definate \\"must watch\\" for anyone who wants to understand what has happened  in the recent past to cause the downfall of so many parts of our economy. This film explains  who, what, and when on what happened and makes it much clearer for us average Americans to  also understand what is still happening today. There are greedy people who are raping the  American people through \\"Wallstreet\\". This film calls it all out!
B002UNMW7O|1.0|Duffy is a one hit wonder. Terrible writing from start to finish. The acting was very spotty as was the cinematography. Why was this movie even greenlit?
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I saw Star Wars when it was released in the theaters, many times.  I bought the action figures and games, then the VHS tapes, then the LaserDisc, then the DVDs, and then the Special Edition DVDs.  I'm drawing the line on the blu-rays because while Lucas is free to change his films as he sees fit, I'm equally free not to buy them if he doesn't give me what I want as a consumer, which is the option to watch them, in blu-ray format, as originally shown in the theaters. I cancelled my Amazon pre-order once I learned that the blu-rays do not contain this option.  Maybe, in a weak moment, I'll pick up a set used off of Amazon marketplace, but I'm morally obligated not to add his sales totals.
1594202710|5.0|A superb educational opportunity from one whose foes even consider him the brightest of the brightest. I just finished it, after reading Walter Issacson's \\"Kissinger\\" and Kissiinger's \\"Diplomacy.\\" A trilogy of big stuff!  I didn't vote for Republicans who Dr Kinsinger served, but I always admired this fellow's mind and work.  China, the book, ends with advice from which one's brain can feel the fullest meaning of the word \\"wise.\\" It's a 20-hour read where Dr K speaks to the reader in lucid language outlining how China came to be presently and why we need not fear, though be concerned with, how they act (not speak) as we should be with how we act (not speak) toward them.  Don't die Dr., the world still needs your input. If ever you must die, thanks for putting into writing all that's in your mind on issues of such greatness that the world's best best not ignore -for all our sake.  I loved the quote from Kant at the end.  A big thank you; and thank God for your life's work.<br />Mickey Long<br />Boston, MA
B000B8QG4A|5.0|This was a great purchase.  The DVD was in excellent shape and as advertised.  Our grandchild loves the movie and overall it was a very smooth transaction.  The product arrived ahead of the promised time.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|When the idiosyncratic crew began to push the VW van all I could do is smile. It wasn't until the horn beeped perpetually that the comedic reel began to reach it climatic scene. Let me back up the comedy and drama starts when Alan Arkin is startled awake and Steve Carrell's sarcasm chimes into the scene. I love this move and cast. It moves from all the members dreaming a dream and their dreams die but they learn to carry each other. Little Miss Sunshine asks tough questions like what is beauty when America wants the easy solution or steps, which is the impossibility. Nobody is Miss or Mister America and who'd want to be in my opinion.
B0050PYNO4|4.0|Being a big fan of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Spaced\\", I was really anticipating this movie. While it doesn't live up to either of those other shows, it is still a fun movie. Anytime you pair up Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, you can't go wrong. I just can't help but wonder if the movie would have been better having been directed by their usual third party, Edgar Wright. But we'll never know and in the meantime I got a few chuckles out of it.
B003VNKNDM|5.0|Got it for my daughter at college.  Seems to be doing it's job, allowing her to transfer files without having to carry her laptop everywhere.  I don't think it has ever come close to filling up - so can't speak to the reliability issue yet.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Play the game only in airplane mode, and make sure to only hit home from the main meu - not in game.  The save issue sucks, but this does seem to protect you until you can win.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Ever since I first got the original droid I wanted a calander widget that can place a full calander on my screen.  This is the first one that I found that does exactly what I wanted, a 4x4 calander that shows the whole month in either a list of events per day or as blocked of times that you have appointments.<br /><br />This is great for all of us that don't have an HTC droid device without Sense.  There are also other sizes and orientations as well as other features, but the month long calander is my favorite and that alone is worth the price
B004FOA84A|4.0|This is a nice little puzzle game. Some parts were easy, some a little harder to figure out. I wish it was longer though!
B000YMBBH0|3.0|I wanted to get the trilogy of these movies because my teenagers haven't seen them and thought they would enjoy watching them.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize that all three of them were HD versions of the movies.  I don't have an HD video player in my house (not even my son's Xbox will play them).  The third movie has both versions, so we can watch it, but the others are useless until I get an HD video player, which I do not intend to do.
B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|Full marks for ambition: pitting a crack squad from Israel's controversial secret intelligence agency against a retired Nazi makes for a complicated game of good versus evil in any weather. But when your monster, the \\"Surgeon of Birkenau\\" (surgeon? Why not butcher? Or slasher?) is not Josef Mengele but one of the lesser villains in the national socialist pantheon of evil (it is all relative, of course) and the Mossad squad is more conflicted in their mission than usual, there is certainly scope for something genuinely challenging.<br /><br />Much is made of Mossad's questionable methods and, in a pointed piece of irony, it is the Israeli Stephan Gold who dehumanises the Nazi prisoner and not, as convention usually requires, the other way round. This is courageous film making, and I can see John Madden getting flack for it in certain conservative quarters. All the more reason to applaud.<br /><br />So to the set up. Back in the seventies, when everything was grimy and brown, Mossad sent three of its youngsters to East Berlin to kidnap said surgeon, now working as a gynaecologist. Their scheme involves Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain) feigning pregnancy to get close enough to Old Dr Gardener to validate that he is indeed their target. This presents some genuinely chilling scenarios: over a stilted conversation (during which he seems to suspects a ruse), a lone Jewish woman opens her legs with stirrups to a Nazi torturer and his instruments. It's a memorable, creepy scene, and it is well executed by all concerned.<br /><br />Satisfied that they have the right man, the surgeon is thrillingly apprehended and spirited away in preparation for a bold escape from Communist Berlin and rendition to Israel to stand trial for war crimes.<br /><br />Of course, the Mossad escape plan has as many holes in it as the permanently leaking roof of their safe house. When it is eventually upset - as, of course, it must be - it is by something as unforeseeable as a postal worker stepping outside for a cigarette. The team improvises an escape under a hail of bullets from the East German guards, but are nonetheless now intractably stuck behind the iron curtain with an elderly German doctor for a prisoner.<br /><br />In another courageous move, Dr Vogel turns out not to be much of a monster at all - his first concern is for his wife - but neither has he resiled a great deal from his Nazi views. With these he regales and taunts his captors and, sure enough, the shoots of some stockholm syndrome begin to emerge, particularly as regards young Rachel.<br /><br />You'd be forgiven for drawing a parallel with Silence of the Lambs - John Madden wants you to, I think - but the exchanges between Rachel and Dr Vogel have nothing like the weapons-grade intensity of Hannibal Lecter's interlocutions with Clarice Starling. They might have, had Dr Vogel been more of a Mengele.<br /><br />In the Berlin sequence there are some fine performances from an ensemble cast. A special shout out must go to poor old Marton Csokas - once a fairy in The Lord of the Rings and before that geeky Dr. Leonard on a New Zealand soap opera - who excellently plays Mossad leader Stephan Gold for three quarters of the film, but still hasn't got enough name recognition (or pronounceability, perhaps) to get a significant billing despite being a lead role in the film. Sam Worthington does, on the other hand, most recently having been seen as a tall blue mongrel Avatar, and he steals the show with an intense performance as David Peretz, the most idealistic and personally invested of the agents. Though she'd be a closer resemblance to a young Julianne Moore, Jessica Chastain does well as the young Helen Mirren, despite having to sexually tease both David and Stephan simultaneously in a pair of completely non-sensical relationships.<br /><br />The convoluted set of moral imperatives are further compounded by a series of twists that turn the screenplay into a tourniquet. It is difficult to discuss much more of the plot without spoiling surprises as there are so many, but this is symptomatic of the film's weakness: it tries to do too much everything: there are unnecessary angles, subplots, characters and locations. A bit more gusto with the editor's pen on this peripheral stuff might have given room for a better exploration of the central relationship between Rachel and Dr Vogel, which to me is the heart of the film.<br /><br />The East Berlin action over, we transpose to modern day Tel Aviv, where Madden needs Singer (now Helen Mirren, bearing the scars of the operation, physically and psychologically) to have a rationale for re-engaging in something she's long left behind. The device he chooses doesn't ring awfully true: a daughter conceived during the original operation to Stephan who has grown up and written a book about the raid which, despite it misreporting events entirely, Rachel is nonetheless sponsoring.<br /><br />It isn't clear why Rachel Singer would sanction a book about the botched raid, much less an inaccurate one by her own daughter, other than to paint her character into a corner suitable for the screenplay to develop. Screenplay accordingly does so develop: Mirren is characteristically watchable as Rachel, but the film still loses its way in the final reel (it does this even literally: Mirren is obliged to traipse up to a remote mental hospital in the Ukraine for her final showdown).<br /><br />When it should be building to unbearable proportions the tension dissipates and the film ends on a rather ambiguous down-beat. This may be a product of a director wanting to stay true to his intellectual principles at the expense of the easy thrills of a thriller. If so, I think Madden has taken the wrong option: After thirty years, little enough is still at stake (only egos, really) and too many guns and fight sequences have taken place to carry the notion that this film isn't, at its heart, a good old fashioned spy yarn. Fundamentally it is - and a compelling, tense and watchable one at that, though it will be interesting to see how it compares to the newly filmed Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.<br /><br />Olly Buxton<br />(Flickfeast)many, but this is symptomatic of the film's weakness: it tries to do too much everything: there are unnecessary angles, subplots, characters and locations.

B004OC07F8|1.0|This book is typical of the people who submit business cases today expecting approval as a fait accompli. While the concept of blue ocean is sound it is also obvious (go places where no one else is and you can have super normal profits), true innovation is hard and economic rents harder still. Cirque de Soleil is faced with stiff competition and dell's world has been disrupted by the technology I am typing this review on (a XOOM tablet). I guess it depends on how you define sustainable. Ultimately though this book fails due to the fact that economic rents cannot be produced via a tick a box process as suggested. If they could then everybody would be generating them and therefore no one would be as they'd no longer be super normal.
B000URDE2Y|3.0|I bought \\"For earth below\\" and \\"Bridge of sights\\" in LP in the years 70. I can't explain, but \\"For Earth Below\\" is  better, has another feeling... The song \\"Shame the Devil\\" for example, that wah-wah guitar and the vocals turns me on! I think that \\"For earth below\\" deserves an exclusive CD remastered!

0765316897|5.0|I came into this series slightly doubtful. For some reason I'd always been a little bit cautious of Sanderson's work, I'm not exactly sure why. However, one day I finally decided to see what this guy could do, after all, he had taken over for Robert Jordan in writing one of my favorite fantasy series' ever.     Wow, I am so glad that I gave these books a chance. Sanderson's writing is a welcome change from someone like Jordan. Although Jordan is incredible in his ways, Sanderson's efficient, rapid prose allows me to totally immerse myself in the books without losing suspension of disbelief. I didn't read these books as much as I lived them, if that makes any sense.     Some people have voiced criticisms about Sanderson's writings, namely how he wrote some characters and the pacing of the final book. I'd tend to agree with them. The relationship between Vin and Elend always struck me as a little weak. Additionally, characters like Ham and Breeze were very one dimensional, there didn't seem to be too much depth to them. However, not all of Sanderson's characters were weak. I actually found the Lord Ruler to be one of the more fascinating characters in the series, especially in this final book. Additionally, TenSoon, and both Vin and Elend were fleshed out well.     In any other book, that may have warranted a four star rating, but this isn't any other book. Sanderson's plot is simply incredible. I now have complete faith in him finishing the Wheel of Time, his plot-writing and imagination are simply of a caliber I have rarely seen before. Everything fit together so well at the end of this book, sliding together so neatly, but at the same time becoming something completely unexpected and surprising. It's just amazing. The ending is bittersweet, but it's not heartbreaking, which is something I appreciate (I get really tired of the Hollywood happy ending). Still, the last few pages will leave you with a sense of sorrow, both from what happens, and from the fact that there's no more pages left to read! Yeah, I can't say enough good things about the plot. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read the series, so I'll just say that you have to experience it. Anyone who appreciates a story that WORKS should buy this series now and start reading.     All in all, this book wraps everything up VERY well (except for one small question that I know is going to nag me for a long time) and truly makes the series a classic. Go read this book.

0553801473|3.0|Ok..I wrote a previous review on ADWD the second I finished the book, that was a mistake. The hype, years waiting for it plus the HBO thing made me praise this book way too much for what really is.....a rushed and UNFINISHED book.<br /><br />Yep....I guess Mr. Martin (who is a GENIUS and I cannot thank him enough for these wonderful books) it's paying more attention to TV land that his own books.<br /><br />I'm not sure where, when or how A Dance With Dragons was written, but you can tell after reading the thing a couple of times (3 times for me) that it's simply not finished. It's hacked...I can even make a picture on my mind...Mr. Martin trying to get the book out of his way to focus on the TV Series...and that IS A HUGE MYSTAKE.<br /><br />Now, I personally would have preferred to wait another 2 years for this particular book...It could have been a masterpiece...now it is what it is.....<br /><br />PD. I guess a little part to blame is on us...the fans...for pressuring authors to pop out books as fast food nation burgers...simply cannot happen.<br /><br />My 2 cents.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Normally, I don't spend money on Kindle Singles as I can usually find the same price for full length books. I decided to give this a shot as I hadn't read SK in a while. While I loved reading Full Dark, No Stars last year, Mile 81 was a pleasant throw-back to King's classic horror stories.

B000O8OTNC|2.0|Allright so I picked this up because of the high reviews but they were misleading so here goes... The sharpener will work maybe for times before it dulls the blade, also due to it's design if you sharpen often enough you'll gouge the plastic surrounding it with the blade itself, even using the serrated sharpener might work at the correct angle but eventually that won't work well either... In summary get a better sharpener.
B003E88TKS|5.0|George Clooney is the detached central character in Oscar nomination form. He's a professional fire man, who personally fires surplus employees on behalf of companies across the USA and obsessively clocks up air mile privileges along the way. Clooney's relationships with colleagues, a girl he meets in transit, sister and family act as counterpoints to his otherwise lonely existence. Old and contemporary themes find a home here in the pursuit of love and life's meaning amid the background detachment of modern air travel. The human drama and fragility of the characters from the fired (not actors but people fired in life) to those doing the firing holds your interest throughout. The movies taught direction and memorable musical score adds zest to the visual palate. I'd like to see more. Yep I loved it.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|I got this as a free app of the day, so I can't complain too much, but I would be mad if I paid for it.  The crappy accuweather widget that came with my Atrix is better than this for me.  The radar is cool, but takes an eternity to load (on WiFi too!  It isn't a large file size!)  Weather data was very spotty for the locations I was in, and they had poor accuracy (my accuweather widget knows what town or section of town I am in WITHOUT GPS).  And when I woke up this morning, there was something new in the status bar, that I never asked for, and wasn't previously set to be on.  The fact that it does things like that on its own irritated me enough to uninstall the app.  I would not recommend getting this.
0307716511|5.0|I have to admit, I was a little hesitant to read this book.  After having been burned by a few other highly acclaimed novels, I tend to be a bit leery or anything that receives as much praise as this book has.  In this particular case, though, the praise is highly deserved.    This book feels so real.  Everything about it is deeply, deeply felt and that comes across in every word that is written.  The depth of emotions immediately drew me in, and I was very vested in the story.  It was tempting to race through it to find out what happens at the end, but it was also the type of book that is written in such a way that it demands to be read a bit more slowly, felt a bit more deeply.    While the relationship between the two sisters takes center stage here, I was also really drawn into the depiction of Beatrice's relationship with her mother.  Aside from being a story about the strong bonds of sisterhood, this is also something of a coming-of-age tale.  In the beginning, Beatrice's mother appears to be one thing but, over the course of the story, the scales begin to fall off Beatrice's eyes, and we can see just how much she had misjudged her mother.  I thought this was beautifully done, a very nuanced and subtle portrait of the complexities of the relationship between a mother and daughter.    I wouldn't, however, want to give short shrift to the relationship between Beatrice and her sister.  This novel does such a wonderful job of showing how the bonds of love and family ties shape who we all ultimately become.  In the beginning, Beatrice sees herself as the teacher, but she comes to understand just how much she has learned from her sister.  What's more, she uses this knowledge to help her grow and to take new risks.  This, for me, was really the beauty of the novel.  It's such a moving portrayal of how a terrible tragedy can wake someone who never before realized that they were sleeping.    My only real quarrel with the novel was with the ending, which I didn't quitelike.  But the rest of the book is so strong, the language so rich and evocative.  This is the type of book that really grabs a reader and then sticks with them.  Lupton is a very gifted, luminous writer.
B0053B347M|5.0|I had serious trouble with eyestrain on a LCD monitor. I kept playing around with the Monitor  and my 550ti Nvidia graphics card settings in the Control Panel. Then I bought this on a Whim hoping it would make a difference. I already had a INcandesant light in the back. But I think it was too bright.    Just make sure your Monitor is bright enough like 70 brightness when a Monitor is too DARK it can cause eyestrain just as well if it's too bright. Just adjust the setting in the Nvidia control Panel mine are 20 B 20 C  and .71 Gamma on a Asus 21.1 Asus led lcd.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I was expecting much more in the 2nd book. The story felt choppy and some things were left hanging in the air.   Did Kvothe meet up with Felurian again? Where is his Shaed now? Locked away in the box in his room, in present day time that he can't open? How does Bast fit into this story, other then Kvothe's Fae assistant? Who is Bast? Is he a child Kvothe made with Felurian? Why didn't Kvothe get the honor of killing the Arcanist that tried to kill the Maer? Afterall, he did kill plenty of Bandits.   What's up with Denna, why doesn't Kvothe just ask her what her real name is or why she keeps changing it instead of doing guessing games. When are we finally able to read about Denna and Kvothe's first kiss? Or are we just going to read that Kvothe has become at the age of 16 a sexaholic with no Romance. Has he learned nothing from Felurian? I would like to have a description of what some of those things are that she taught him. Thousand Hands, sounds interresting.  I love Rothfuss's writing, especially the first book, it had me at the edge of my seat. I would recommend it to any reader. But this 2nd one is missing quite a few things. I love the poetry though.  I wish there would have been a bit more detailed explanation as to how Kvothe poisened the stew that the Bandit \\"Ruh's\\" were eating and got upset stomachs. That entire section of the story deserved a little more attention, I would have loved to read more details about his stay with the fake Ruh's.  I know that he's only 16 in the story, and it sounds like Kvothe is extremely streetsmart. I don't understand why the grown up Kvothe is so depressed and has a deathwish. It would have been nice to find out about that a little bit more.   I hope that Ambrose will be the king that Kvothe will kill, he is a sleezy slimy worm that would deserve it.  I love the characters in the book. I hope that in the 3rd book there will be more fun people entering the scene and that some explanations or clarifications will be written about.  I do like how Rothfuss goes right into the story instead of giving a huge review of the first book like many other writers do. Afterall, I have the first book if I want to go back and refresh my memory.  The 2nd book is a bit jumpy and choppy but it is still a good book to read, and I will read any sequel coming out.  Please don't let us wait too long for it to get published.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|its great, got it free, and it did install for Motorola xooms, I did it on 2 of them with no problem
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This has to seriously be one of my favorite movies of all time.  I wasn't expecting to like it but I love it and find myself quoting it regularly.  It's hilarious and sweet.  My 3 year old loves it, my 55 year old husband loves it and I love it.  So it covers lots of generations!
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Zodiac is a pretty good film. The characters stand out and have full well-rounded qualities. Jake Gyllanhal is fantastic. He's a good actor to begin with. Great casting everybody is excellent in their roles. The script is very well written. I was entertained and I believe most people who watch this film will also be entertained.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|I think if you're buying this dvd you know it's good. Wes Anderson is a genius when it comes to characters and minute nuances. Every interaction is so smart. I just wish he wasn't so completely unsexy.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Fans: Please stay away from this collection.  First off, it does not contain the original cuts of these films.  Secondly, you need to purchase the entire \\"saga\\" to get all of the bonus materials and docs.  Skip both of these new releases and wait until Lucas satisfies the real fans. Joseph Campbell must be rolling in his grave,
B004LWZVZM|4.0|I was at a screening of the film and spoke to one of the producer.  Before anyone gets too carry away with the script, all the court room dialog came from the court transcripts.  The efforts to get a good period look to the film was appreciated but came slightly short in some areas.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|If you like darker scifi films like Event Horizon, you'll enjoy this one.  It's pretty bare bones as far as plot goes, nothing too surprising happens, but it's all done very well, with believable action and character interaction.      The sound track is particularly good, really pushes the ambiance of the movie from good to great.
B005LQZT5Y|4.0|Loved it, Just ordered the Steelbook from Amazon.co.uk (which you can get for under $30, as opposed to buying it from one of the sellers & saving $15) I can't wait to get it & will add more to the review after i watch all the special features!
B004LWZW4C|1.0|First I have to say that getting the Bluray to play is hit or miss depending on the bluray drive. Secondly, the digital copy has been all MISS for me. I can't get it to play on an HD2 nor on a Samsung Infuse, neither in the Apple (mp4) nor Windows (wmv) formats.    Don't make 'digital copy' a marketing point if it's only going to work some of the time.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|My new tv only has a connection for digital audio, no more red/white audio connections.  Also, like many of the new thin hdtv's, the sound was horrible.  The only devices I have to connect the tv to have only the red/white audio connections.  This device solved the problem beautifully.  Simply plug a digital cable from your tv to the device, then connect red white cables from the device to your receiver, or speaker dock.  (Be sure the switch is set properly.)  Highly recommended.
B0043A0PXU|3.0|I have been a fan of Eurythmics as well as Annie & Dave's solo work for decades.  The record company ruined what should be an intimate holiday album by using a steamroller to process the audio.  There is NO dynamic range, and it's run up to digital 0+ so it's also distorted in places, which makes the listening experience fatiguing after a couple of songs (if you're listening on good speakers, not an iPod).    Music & performance:  *****  \\"Mastering\\"(ecch):    *
B000E15JY2|4.0|I read it for inspiration as much as for wisdom. It is hard to image the horrors he must have faced in the concentration camps and the loss of his family. The fact he could come out of it with such vision and ability to inspire and help others is amazing.
B005CAPS0K|5.0|Best horrormshow I Have seen in a long time. Not a big fan of horror but this movie is a must watch. Excellent story line. This movie will keep you in suspense throughout!!!
0393061310|5.0|I read this book shortly after it was first published and was fascinated, absorbed and grateful. I have continuously recommended this book ever since. Now I see there are 1225 reviews. I  have never seen so many reviews of one book. I am amazed to see 111 one-star reviews; what can they be thinking?  Being #1226 means my review is superfluous and redundant, so I will say only this: when I rule the world (I have a sure-fire plan)  I will have everyone read this book.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I think this singer is incredibly talented and that there were a lot of innovations on this cd.Musically that is. I heard one song on the radio while I was driving , and I found it moved me to tears. Had to order the cd right away!
B003L77GRO|1.0|I was a fan of the first four seasons and was excited for this one but it let me down big. Stupid plot, dumb new characters, the same repetitive dexter activities every episode. This season is by far the worst of any produced. It was so bad that i have completely lost faith in the show.

B000002HNR|5.0|I was 15 or so when this record came out. I was a huge fan, but still in transition between top 40 and underground radio. The in-between was album rock radio (possibly best described as a cross between the most accessible songs of the sometimes way too weird underground rock radio and the hard rock of top 40). The Doors probably straddled both sides of that fence better than any other band of the time, except maybe the Beatles and the Stones. There have been a few revolutionary eras in music and that was one of them. I didn't realize that then, but I was hearing lots of strange, exciting music on the radio and from my friends older siblings, who had a better idea of what was going on. The Doors were cool, but far stranger that I could possibly imagine. Whatever age you are, I suspect you experienced a time when music was really exciting. This was my time.<br /><br />I don't remember how I found out this record was in stores, but I did, and scraped the $7 or so it cost, bought it and played it as soon as I got home and in my room. Like most of the best records I heard in those days, there was nothing tired and predictable about it. I didn't understand what the lyrics were about and didn't get the sex, drug and spiritual references, but I was still excited and mystified by what I heard. Morrison's screams excited me on a primal level.<br /><br />After hearing most of the concert recordings this album was culled from, over the last 20 years or so, many purchased from Amazon.com, I think this is still the best. If I'd been producing it, I would have left out \\"The Celebration of the Lizard\\" and \\"Close to You,\\" and squeezed in \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"The End\\" instead, but I think I understand why they did what they did. However, that's just guesswork and not worth boring you with.<br /><br />I think the reason I prefer this record over all the complete concert recordings, is because all of Jim's drunken, self-indulgent b.s. is cut out, along with the many blues jams that the musicians must have loved playing, but aren't very entertaining to listen to, such as the excruciatingly long, slow \\"Mystery Train\\" jam and all those old rock songs Jim no longer bothered to remember the lyrics to. And the sound on \\"Absolutely Live\\" is so great! Not every concert from that tour sounds so good.<br /><br />I also loved the album cover. I think the picture of Jim is a colorized b&w shot, and the band in the background is dropped in a bit awkwardly, but keep in mind, it was designed 20 years or so before Photoshop, and not everything was always shot in color.<br /><br />Later, I had that compilation of \\"Absolutely Live\\" and all those live recordings originally released on EPs, called \\"in Concert,\\" I think, but the second CD sounded too much like scraps. Glad they released the recordings, but not a very good \\"album\\" listening experience.<br /><br />To sum up, I think they sorted thru all the music they recorded that year and put together the best of what the Doors did on stage. But I still look forward to every live recording they release. I can't wait for the next one!loved playing, but aren't very entertaining to listen to, such as the excruciatingly long, slow \\"Mystery Train\\" jam and all those old rock songs Jim no longer bothered to remember the lyrics to.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was going to pre-order this but after hearing about the non-stop tinkering with the originals, I give up. I don't think I can say anymore than what has been already said here. I watched the clip where Vader say \\"Nooooooooo\\",  scene destroyed...    What an absolute shame!
B0046IGOIO|3.0|That night in Vancouver, the band seems to be relaxed and having fun improvising, but the sound is only in the range of a good bootleg. What's so sad about that is, that after listening to so many of the Doors concerts from that tour, it's a shame that what may be the most unique performance of them all, doesn't sound so good. But, it's still wonderful to hear. I think Albert King was a better musician than the Doors, but they sound real good together. Wouldn't it have been cool if the Doors made an album with lots of the great blues artists of the time? Kinda like \\"Hooker 'N' Heat.\\"  Oh well.
0240815807|5.0|Mike Senior has a great way of showing me not only how to do things I don't already know but also, and for me much more satisfying, how to use the skills I've already picked up in the most useful and creative way. His language is straightforward, never patronising, often funny and always enlightening.

He pulls no punches where appropriate so prepare to rethink your assumptions.    Highly recommended. Get it in hardback if available, it's a keeper.
0345529057|5.0|I ordered these books as \\"used\\" to save money. I had seen the series on HBO and it piqued my interest. These books arrived in pristine condition and promptly, too.  I love this option and find it well worth the money. Tonight, I'll start chapter 1.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|The real world plot was a bit forced and some of the story premises and twists did not work for me. That being said, once they go into the dream sequences, the special effects, the CGI were state of the art and fantastic! The fact that there are five hot babes in sexy outfits wielding swords and kicking-ass kung fu style didn't hurt none either.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|New Post  Giving it a ONE STAR because now I don't know what to believe. I have been informed Renewed Hope is a fake. I could not tell. I didn't think people could make things look that close to the real thing on their own. I am sorry if anyone was tricked or confused like me. I say WE WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. I do know there are people getting the blu ray in Australia a week early. A lot of un-boxing on youtube but no film footage.      Confused Post  Below was my old post - I just saw footage of the blu ray version. LOOKS AWESOME! Go to youtube and copy and paste this.     Star Wars - A Renewed Hope - Blu Ray 15 minutes of changes     His blue light saber looks GREAT!  So happy. Forget the other changes that everyone is bitching about. LUCAS makes up for it big time! Plus the other changes in the video are like WOW! SPACE SCENES ARE THE BEST. All of you people can complain about the little things but I WILL BE BUYING THIS     OLD POST BELOW  You can redo the movie, add extra scenes, new lines, cgi, and that is fine. If you can't fix the original problems that FANS clearly point out then I am not buying. Its very simple. FIX THE LIGHTSABER COLORS. Luke's lightsaber in episode IV is suppose to be blue not (white/or/green). Stop worrying about adding and start worrying about fixing!   Look at what happened to Lord Of The Rings. Everyone waited for the extended version on blu ray instead buying the first thing handed to them. Don't think fans will buy this until it is what they want.
B005HNMPBM|5.0|Even though this movie has little resemblance with the cannon pre X-Men mythology as an X-Men fan I loved this movie.  Every once in a while Hollywood takes a comic book franchise off the rails of the cannon mythos and throws there own spin on it, and it's almost always to complete disaster.  The real reason it's usually a disaster is because they don't take it off the rails to go in a a new direction on purpose but rather most often Hollywood just fails to comprehend and/or research the genre so it fails to take advantage of the gold mines of existing material and will often contradict the original material as a result.  This is one of those rare exceptions where they took it off the rails deliberately and made it even better.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I bought these as a possible replacement for the Sony MDR-A35 headphones, which are apparently not available.  These \\"new\\" headphones sound great, but they reek of \\"cheap plastic crap\\" syndrome.  I'm really surprised that Sony put its name on this product.  I'm not holding my breath that these headphones will stand up to a lot of normal use, let alone the usual abuse that occurs while exercising.    Ugh!

1609611543|5.0|Every once in a while a book will come along alleging to have found the source of all the world's ills, and usually we roll our eyes smelling a hyperbole.  But Wheat Belly is different -- Dr. Davis nails ground zero of many of today's epidemics by exposing the rampant destructive impacts of modern/mutant wheat on our minds and bodies, all while the mainstream sings the anthem of \\"healthy whole grains.\\" This is an important and engaging book that should be read by everybody with blood sugar, weight, or autoimmunity problems. My only criticism (and it's tiny in comparison to my great admiration for his work) is that Dr. Davis seems to unduly minimize the role refined sugar is also playing in food-related addictions and our raging epidemics. But no matter, this book should be required reading for doctors and patients alike.
0312600844|5.0|People raised in free societies are different than those raised in other types of countries and environments - more conservative, more religious, dictatorships. Alas, freedom does not bring us happiness because we are more confused and more exposed to steadily weighing our rights vs.someone else's rights; choosing a profession or not; wanting to work a lot or a little; living in the country or in the city, believing or not believing in God, etc. Franzen fully and splendidly makes us understand the trappings of freedom, but also its infinite rewards - the luxury of finding out who we are and, in some cases, even choosing our path in life at the high price of making our own mistakes. I loved the book.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|The acting was really good in this movie, and the story line was interesting.  Basically, it was about a fanatical religious group (a Bible thumping hate group against gays and fornification) that takes matters into their own hands to make sure \\"Gods\\" enemies go to hell.  Of course, due to the acting talent of the actor playing the preacher, I actually felt he and his flock were more representative the \\"devil\\" instead of \\"God\\" (I thought that would be the big twist to the movie, but it wasn't) Anyway, that's all I'm going to say about that as I don't want to ruin the movie plot, but if you wish to see a fringe group of religious zealots with a hint of inbreeding and madness you shouldn't miss this movie!      P.S.  Next time you see a hate group picketing a funeral or hasseling people, take a closer look, this movie demonstrates what happens when they take their hatred one step further.........and how our government may deal with it.

My only problem with the app is that after you beat it, which shouldn't take more than about a half an hour, it has zero replay value. I uninstalled it to save space. (oh, I also had to use an app like superbox to be able to move it to SD card.)
B00000IQW5|5.0|My wife has loved this movie since it was released. I purchased the DVD as a gift for her recent retirement.

B0050CQY1W|1.0|In my opinion, Beyonce is wayyy overrated.  This cd is a hot mess!  Beyonce is a talented performer and singer, but I just did not get that on this album.  True artists like Fantasia, Jaheim, Alicia Keys, Lyfe Jennings, etc.  can do their thing without getting naked all the time. A true musician maintains a certain dignity about themselves, while making you respect who they are as artists.  Beyonce's music was way better with Destiny's Child!!!!

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|What can I say other than the situation in America is worse than I thought it was.<br /><br />As someone pointed out in a book I recently read, the overriding reason for homeowner default in America is rising medical bills, and the inability of the individual homeowner to meet those costs.<br /><br />The scary thing that this movie shows us is that so called \\"insurance companies\\" are little more than tall structures of steel and glass manned by people sitting at cubicles whose sole job is to find ways to deny medical service to their clients.<br /><br />The part where he goes to Cuba, and demands medical attention for his American friends (who were denied coverage in America) from a boat outside the Guantanamo Naval Base, is priceless.<br /><br />They finally have to settle for seeing a Cuban doctor, which, in retrospect, isn't all that bad.

B001Q3KM9E|5.0|This is perhaps the only book I have read three times.  The last time I read it was on a boat crossing the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />Several things stand out.  One, war is crazy.  Two, people are crazy.  Three, woman are hysterical.<br /><br />Our protagonist, Yossarian, spends a lot of his time in the military hospital, as he realizes that is perhaps the only place where he can't get killed.<br /><br />Around Yossarian revolve a truly unforgettable assortment of characters, from rabid war-mongers to meek pacifists, with the entire gamut of humanity spanning the gap in between.  Some quotes:<br /><br />&quot;McWatt was the craziest combat man of them, because he was perfectly sane and did not mind the war.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Milo defended the historic right of free men to pay as much as they had to for things they needed in order to survive.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Look fellows, we've got to have some confidence in the people above who issue our orders.  They know what they are doing.&quot;<br />&quot;The hell they do.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Colonel Korn was the lawyer, and if Colonel Korn assured him that fraud, extortion, currency manipulation, embezzlemment, income tax evasion and black market speculation were legal, Colonel Cathcart was in no position to disagree..............&quot;<br /><br />Perhaps the most entertaining and insightful book I have ever read.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot.  I did not tell you what this book is about.  Well, it is a war novel, it takes place in Italy on an idyllic island in the Mediterranean, and it is about how ****ed up the US military (and, I assume, all militaries) is.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It might interest customers to know that this set of films was *NOT* mastered in as high a definition as most HD remasters are. It *is* the sharpest the films have ever looked, but technically far below most Blu-ray remasters of classic films.  George Lucas is lazy, and he is a hack revisionist. He doesn't know when to leave well enough alone, and move on to new projects. I am convinced his success with the early trilogy was as much due to the effort of his wife Marcia, an expert editor and one who understood the importance of character, as well as Gary Kurtz, the producer who kept Lucas reigned in, and who offered critical input. With no oversight and external input, George makes technically excellent, but storytelling deficient movies. The prequels are a complete joke, gaudy with all the pointlessly overdone elements, over-the-top characters, and stilted dialogue.   If this set had contained REAL remasters of the original versions of the original 3 movies, I would not mind the revisionist nonsense and I would have purchased this set.  However:  People are being asked to pay $90 for a product that has myriad technical flaws, things that should have been corrected regardless of what movie it is. These are a distraction and shoddy workmanship.  Also, changes are continually being made to the substance of the movies without offering the originals. Many movies get doctored by their directors. But when this is done, it should be and usually is done concurrently with a careful restoration and release of the original version in the best possible quality. But in this case it's not.  AVOID this. If you keep paying Lucas to butcher the movies and bury the original movies we grew up on, we won't recognize them after a while, and he will not stop. I can't believe I ever idolized Lucas. I don't now. With each release of the Star Wars movies, he destroys a little more of our childhood memories.

0553801473|5.0|Martin has spoiled us so much with great storytelling that some readers seem to be harshly criticizing what is without doubt one of the better books in the genre.

I thought the 1/4\\" 20 camera mount was threaded into the plastic but it turns out its a nut embedded in the plastic.

B000ECX0QU|5.0|Mystery, suspense and murder follow the defection of a top soviet spy.<br /><br />The story concerns itself with the Cuban Missile Crises (circa 1962) and French intelligence's intervention in Cuba with respect to American interests.<br /><br />A French intelligence officer's wife is having an affair with a man, codename \\"Topaz\\", and the point is made that all wives always talk \\"shop\\" concerning the work of their spy spouses. Thus, \\"Topaz\\" knows everything;<br /><br />The husband, a French intelligence officer, is having an affair with the beautiful head of a subversive underground group in Havana.  Before starting this movement, she played an important role in the seating of Fidel Castro, as Batista was fleeing. The national respect earned by her work provided a position of influence, but since that time, she has observed that the Castro government is not the government she wanted, so creates a new underground movement for personally satisfaction.<br /><br />This is a quiet, subtle Hitchcock film without major film stars; that is, stars recognizable to American audiences. But it definitely is Hitchcock, from a book by Leon Uris.<br /><br />While searching \\"Topaz\\" for Hitchcock's cameo appearance, remember he can be seen behind every camera.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|This is a refurbished set that i purchased. I was rather dismayed that the screen froze twice - once after the first charge and the next day after i troubleshooted it. For some unknown reason, the watch froze at 1957h on both days. I could not reset the watch pressing the start/stop and lap/reset buttons simultaneously for 7-10s as described by the manual. All i saw was this black line that came on, followed by a blank screen when i released the buttons. I tried this for half a day with no avail.  Surfed the internet, read other reviews for solutions and it seemed that many have the same problem. I am not sure if the sets that behaved this way were refurbished sets - they didn't mention.  After trying the soft resets for a while, i tried to let the watch discharge by leaving the charging clip on and the USB portion disconnected. After about 6-7h, the battery was totally flat and i was able to charge it again. the flat battery seemed to have reseted the watch.  I did this twice and had a 3km run in between the ..    After the 2nd time i discharged the watch using the clip, the watch screen did not freeze for the past 48H. i managed to finish a half marathon today with the watch still function. My fingers are crossed that it stays this way.    I totally love the GPS and HR functions of the watch. The ANT+ and Garmin training centre nicely maps the run and reports the statistics, something that is useful for runners to keep track of their pace over a period of time. If i didn't have the 2 episodes of frozen screens, I have rated it 5/5 stars.

0756404738|4.0|This book is part two of a story about how a legendary hero is created, within a quasi-medieval fantasy world that has magic and faeries. Rothfuss continues to show how both events and rumors are woven together to build a legend.  This volume also moves toward a dramatic conclusion when Kvothe's oral history of his life reaches the present. Foreshadowing of that moment suggests some things, but I'm sure the author has surprises in store as well.<br /><br />Rothfuss is a born story-teller, and this book is a very easy read that is hard to put down. Like its predecessor, I think it's also overly long. Apparently Rothfuss agrees (read his Amazon interview).<br /><br />Though the book tells Kvothe's life story well, there isn't enough of a \\"reveal\\" in two areas: (1) the framing of the entire story; and (2) facts about the Chandrian and Amyr, which motivate many of Kvothe's actions. The framing still doesn't add to the story, since we haven't had any real character development among Kvothe's listeners, just some foreshadowing. We meet one of the Chandrian very briefly but learn really nothing of them.<br /><br />There are also lots of loose ends unresolved, weird stories that come from nowhere and disappear, and characters who don't move the story along. To list them would provide spoilers, but: really. Still, Rothfuss writes so well, I'm sure the household will devour the third book - - and that gets him a fourth star that is not quite deserved.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|As you're probably well aware, 127 Hours is about the miraculous/tragic story surrounding Aron Ralston, the young man who made the decision to go on a hiking trip without telling anyone which eventually led to an unfortunate incident where a boulder happened to crash down directly on top of his arm, making it so Aron couldn't free himself and became trapped.  He does everything he can to remove the rock, but this is where the story kicks in.  Can he survive?      Of course you know the answer is yes, he does, and... as I mention in the first sentence- this story can either be considered really miraculous that he survived, or tragic that he lost an arm.  It's up for interpretation where you stand on the matter, but I believe it's more miraculous because he actually managed to free himself after many harsh hours of determination and doing whatever it takes just to make it out alive.  Despite eventually becoming short on water, time and body strength, he never lost his will to survive.  Truly courageous.      Throughout the film Aron hallucinates about the things he wants (such as a drink of orange gatorade sitting in the back seat of his truck parked several miles away) and fantasizes about his past and specifically his family (the scene where his younger sister was playing the piano in the family living room and Aron was video taping it is probably the most interesting memory).       Going into this movie, I already knew the story pretty well.  I remember when the incident happened back in 2003, but there were some things I was *not* aware of (such as Aron meeting two female hikers shortly before his accident occurred).      Now I could sit here and nitpick over a few unnecessary segments (such as the first 15 minutes of film which was totally pointless \\"let's all have a good time and party\\" nonsense that didn't accomplish anything noteworthy, and a few of the hallucinations later on were WAY too incoherent and bizarre and in a few instances -such as a certain thunderstorm- I wasn't sure whether it really happened or whether Aron just made up the event through a terrible dream) but besides that, 127 Hours does a fantastic job showing you a man who certainly had the deck stacked against him and had to overcome a serious obstacle.  He had to make dreaded, life-changing decisions in order to make it out of the desert alive, and 127 Hours really captures the horrible event.      The actor who plays Aron Ralston does a magnificent job portraying what kind of fun-loving, likeable and adventurous man Aron Ralston is.  I highly recommend it.
0756405890|4.0|This book tells the story of how a legendary hero is created, within a quasi-medieval fantasy world that has magic and faeries. It's an interesting notion, and Rothfuss's answer looks at how both events and rumor combine to build a legend. He's a born story-teller, and it's a very easy read that is hard to put down.<br /><br />Still, there are some parts of the book that I would have rethought if I were his editor. The main story has a weak frame around it. Most of the book consists of the main character telling his life story to a Chronicler, as another mysterious character listens in. Occasionally the narrative breaks to current events. The personal history will eventually be brought to the present, at which points various story lines come together.<br /><br />After more than 1000 pages of two books, I still don't see any narrative advantages of the flashback structure instead of just telling the personal history directly. There are disadvantages in the current structure, which disrupts the main narrative and leaves various things (such as demonic spiders) just hanging forever.<br /><br />I'd also like to see some tighter editing. The story spends too much time in the rough seaport, Tarbean. This establishes the main character's difficult youth, but the details do not yield many other payoffs for the rest of the story. Some interpersonal conflicts at the University and relations with a moneylender also become more repetitive than necessary to move the story and the character development along.<br /><br />Those are relatively small objections, but one does want a long book to have a tight story.
B005BZQS1E|2.0|I don't really know why but I just couldn't laugh at this, and this is coming from someone that likes Norbit. Obviously my standards are not that high. There is just no original humor, no redeeming story. It's as though they feeling adding a curse to a sentence makes it funny. The effects are good and Natalie Portman is alright in it. But for the most part the jokes just felt old I think. For example in one scene a bowl cut is compared to a penis. Stuff most of us heard in middle school. If comedy is all about timing I think this movie came out 10 years too late for me.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Overall, these are the highest quality headphones that I have ever owned.<br /><br />The sound quality is fantastic, with deep lows and natural highs and mids. What I look for in a headphone is accuracy, and these supply it in force. Music just sounds like it's supposed to sound.<br /><br />They're pretty comfortable, but they aren't the best breathing headphone cups I've ever had. If the pads wear out, replacements ([[ASIN:B001DFX2OC SONY 211566803 Sony Replacement Pad for Sony MDR-7506 and MDR-V6 Headphones - Each]]) are available from Amazon and I even hear that they're interchangeable with other types of headphones. A little Googling should provide you with a few more options if the ear-cups' style bothers you more than they do me. While we're on the topic, another thing that I really like about these cans is that anything you break on them can be replaced. Because they've been out for so long, each and every individual part on these phones is available for order. That buys you a little bit of peace of mind; in case they don't live up to their near legendary reputation for reliability.<br /><br />If I HAD to point out something that I didn't like, the only minor gripe that I have is, while they are foldable and come with a carrying pouch, making them somewhat portable, the cord is too long for a lot of uses. I know they're professional headphones and that the extra cord length may be needed for mixing boards and the like, but it prevents me from using them in situations where having that much cord to trip over isn't acceptable. In a perfect world they would have a breakaway cable so you could use different lengths/styles of cord for different applications.<br /><br />I can't imagine needing more from a set of headphones than these are able to provide. The level of detail and sonic accuracy that these provide is astounding to me, and even though I have bought more headphones since I bought these, I tend to use them as a reference point and plan on keeping them for quite some time.r quite some time.

1848566980|5.0|My first thought about this massive volume is that somebody recognized that Foss's highly influential style deserved a book celebrating his entire career, and not just superficially.  And thank God that person exists!  There is so much content here that it's almost overwhelming.  The print quality is very good for a \\"bargain-priced\\" book and the hardcover binding seems to be of good quality.    I'm a huge sci-fi and hardware fan and I have been a Foss fan since I first saw his book covers in the 70s.  He is without a doubt one of the hyper-influential proto-modernists (just to pile on some buzzwords!)of sci-fi art.  It's odd that we have yet to see a quality big-budget sci-fi movie utilizing his distinctive designs, though attempts have been made.  Probably just as well - Hollywood fails more than it succeeds, and I'd prefer to keep the wonderful worlds and scenarios of his artwork within my own imagination.    I'd say my favorite trio of sci-fi artists are Foss, Berkey, and Mead.  It's great to see such a solid and packed volume that truly honors a great among giants of sci-fi art.  Buy it now!

0525423273|5.0|This book was just... wow. Everything in this book was just so adorable and witty and smart... it was just an altogether great read.<br />This book had such hype leading up to its release, and I didn't know what to think about it. Anna and the French Kiss sounded like something I would not usually read, but I knew I just had to have it, because, hey: the cover is pretty amazing!<br />Anna was such a relatable character that at times it was almost as if she were jumping off the pages at me.<br />You couldn't help but feel for her, having to move from Atlanta, Georgia, all the way to France, just because her father is pretty much the Nicolas Sparks of her world, being a `romance' writer, and wants her to have some `culture' in her life.<br />Her internal dialog was laugh-out-loud funny, and refreshing from all of the sullen thoughts of characters I have been reading lately.<br />All of the secondary characters were very well devolved and you couldn't help but love them. They were just as much a part of this book as Anna herself, and had me wishing all the more that I could jump into the story so that they could be my friends.<br />And St. Claire... our hero was adorable, for a better word.<br />I liked St. Claire. I didn't love him, but I liked him. He wasn't close to perfect by any means, but that's what I liked about him--about all of the characters. And, he totally had an English accent, while still being American, English, and Parisian. Yep. Stephanie Perkins went there, and I love her for it!<br />This book had an amazing cast of characters. All of them were very well developed and I loved all of them. They weren't just there to be there; they actually had roles and I loved that.<br />Anna was so fun to read about and I loved how real she seemed. She was just a teenage girl who somehow ends up in France, and I found her first few days (and everything after that) very believable.<br />Stephanie Perkins really gave this novel such strong detail, so much that I could almost see, smell, and feel everything that Anna did. After reading this novel, I am dying to get out to Paris! And soon!<br />Anna and St. Claire's relationship was very believable. I love the fact that they were best friends who slowly began to develop feelings for one another, but didn't just act on those feelings.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|You know what, I have not seen the new blu's yet but, I will. If George wants to change things and add to his masterpiece who are we to complain. If you don't like what you have read so far then do not buy them, and if you need to be someone who hates on the changes then pull out the classic ones and enjoy. I for one look forward to these Blue rays. So with that, thank you George. Don't get me wrong I love the originals but, the more Star Wars the better is the way I look at it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|All I can say is why? Why George Lucas, WHY?!? The original trilogy turned me into a star wars fanatic, I still remember watching them over and over again on vhs. They were in my opinion perfect, then the special edition versions were released in 1997 and my dad took me and my sister too see them it was cool seeing them in theaters since I wasn't born when they were originally released. What I didn't understand then is what I still don't understand to this day, why is Lucas messing with perfection? He furthers the destruction now with even more pointless and distracting changes with the blu-ray release. All I want is my original trilogy back, what I grew up with, what we all grew up with. We all fell in love with the originals for a reason, these changes make no sense! For how much I love Star Wars I will never buy this set. BOYCOTT STAR WARS BLU-RAY!
0345529057|5.0|As good as the HBO series. A must read for the TV show fans.  Really fills in the blanks in the show!
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Green Lantern is one of my all time faves, so needless to say I was a little disappointed with this abomination. There was way too much cgi and it wasn't even that great looking, plus why did the film makers think it was necessary to make Hal's uniform and mask cg too? The acting was god awful at best and the writing didn't help either. I felt bad for Ryan Reynolds, of whom I am a fan of, because he was dealt a bad hand with this one. Ryan go back to Marvel and do the Deadpool movie!       Overall the movie was rushed along, too many characters not enough time or substance. Lets just say not nearly enough Sinestro. Mark Strong was the only redeeming factor of this terrible film. I don't know why DC can't make a good movie unless it's Batman or Superman. The Emerald Knight deserves way better! If you're a Green Lantern fan and haven't seen this yet, don't bother it will only enrage you.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I recently purchased Dexter season five, after being on the list to be notified when it was available.  I have watched each episode twice already.  I have seen every Dexter episode available on DVD.  Own them all.  I am a big Dexter fan but do not have cable TV.  If you are a Dexter fan, even a new one, this is a must purchase for you!  Honestly, you need to have them all, from season one to now!  You will love it.  Other shows I love are NCIS, Bones & Criminal Minds, so if you are a fan of these shows, yes, definitely get it.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|It's not often that a song makes me so crazy I have to find it immediately and get the cd (I'm so happy I have Amazon Prime!).  I had to type in the few lyrics I remembered from hearing the song a couple of times on the radio. I found it and had it shipped to me.  It's \\"Pumped Up Kids\\" by Foster the People and I love it and I played it over and over for a very long time before I listened to the rest of the cd.  The whole thing is so wonderful that is why I am writing this review.  If this thing is contagious, do yourself a favor and get this cd.  You won't be disappointed.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Total waste of money. This is about a 10 minute read followed by a plug for another Stephen King book. Story itself is ok, but far too short to care about any of the characters.  Avoid this one
B0009PAVI2|4.0|I originally purchased a [[ASIN:B000F4VLGI Tiffen 4 Pocket Filter pouch]] to hold my 3 72mm filters but it was not feasible unless I was bringing my camera case or camera/laptop backpack. Wanting something to attach to my belt, I found this Tamrac case and it performs extremely well. Each filter fits in its own padded compartment making it virtually impossible to damage them. It is relatively easy to get the filters out, though not as easy as the Tiffen. The case construction is superior to any other filter pouches, wallets or cases I have seen. I would bet that the case could fall a far distance and no harm would come to the filters, though I am not going to try that. I almost always attach the case to my belt, making it very handy. Other times I attach it to the shoulder strap of my Nikon 75th Anniversary nylon soft lens case. These points alone make it a very worthwhile purchase to protect your filter investment. The only drawback to me, also mentioned in other reviews, is the use of velco as a fail-safe closure method. The front quick release buckle closure is more than adequate to lock the case. There is also velcro on the belt strap where a snap is provided. Perhaps the Tamrac harnesses work better with the velcro and having both assures multiple useage. That said, I give the case a 4.5. Eliminate the velcro and, for me, the case is a 5.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Highly recommended.  I could not put this novel down.  It is a story of a race car driver, his happiness, his troubles, and his family, told through the eyes of his dog, Enzo.  A fascinating read filled with laughter, sadness, happiness, love, and passion.  The ending was amazing and will stay with you for a long time.  This novel touched my soul.  I cried.  I laughed.  I was drawn into the characters and their lives.  This was the best novel I read this year.  \\"Your car goes where your eyes go.   Simply another way of saying that which you manifest is before you\\"

1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Dugard's story has haunted me since she was taken in 1991.  Every New Year's Eve, I would tell my husband what my wish was, and he knew that I \\"wanted Jaycee Lee Dugard to be found\\".  When the story broke that she was found, he called me at work.  I was so happy to have lived to hear of her survival.  The book is a fast read.  The question why she has not had contact with her step-father has been answered. Her maturity and intellect has been frozen at the age of her capture, and she only remembers the relationship between her and her step-father at the time she was taken; who knows how it would have developed had she not been taken.  Do I feel bad for the guy that he hasn't gotten to ask for forgiveness or for her to offer it?  Perhaps.  But for her to do it because any of us want her to - would be against the grain of what she endured for all those years - to do what that monster - Phillip Garrido - wanted her to do.  So, she is free to do whatever she wants, whenever she wants, however she wants. God Bless you, Jaycee - and may you be forever young.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I am not one to review for just anything. This series BLEW ME AWAY. I never watched it when it was televised but my husband and i bought it on a whim on an amazon deal of the day back around last christmas b/c there were so many great reviews and we always like a new good show. we have been savoring the episodes and finally finished it (not that it was long and grueling to watch b/c it definitely wasn't, we just took out time.) I would recommend this to ANYONE, not just someone into science fiction either - I was addicted to this like I was to \\"Lost\\" for so many years. I have to say I'm glad I wasn't watching this while it was on television b/c the time span between seasons would have drove me mad - being able to watch it at my pace - sometimes a season in a weekend or more - was almost necessary, I HAD to watch more! It was riveting and the story was just sooo good. Just a great story about what it is to be human - something we all can relate to and ponder on, and the ending was great (except starbuck???), its just one that makes you think. I have been so disappointed with so many series wrap ups (Lost!) and this one was way more than acceptable, I thought it was a nice ending - teary and thought provoking. Again, I would recommend this to ANYONE. Loved it and super sad that its over, but it was a thoroughly enjoyable ride! Happy watching, make yourself a Battlestar-ga-snacktica and enjoy!

B005BGBPBG|4.0|As good as the book? Of course not. Entertaining? Yes. Kate Hudson played Darcy PERFECTLY! and i'm so hoping that her and John take on Something Blue because though they hated each other, their chemistry was perfect. I loved every scene with them, who'd have thought they would be that great together. The movie is a fun romantic comedy and though the subject is taboo, you have sympathy for Dex and Rachel b/c you know their history and you know Darcy is not an innocent either. Their situations are all a big hot mess that gets worked out in the end.
0307474712|1.0|I thought I would get this book after reading some of the reviews and the fact that it was turned into a movie. What a mistake! This book is incredibly boring with two awful and unlikable main characters. I can't say anything positive about this story. It took everything I had just to finish it. Save your money because this was a painful read and I can't even imagine how they made a movie out of this drivel.
B00190OHD6|4.0|when this movie was over, that was how my husband described me, wrapped in my snuggie, tissues, a heaving hot mess of tears. i fought watching this movie for at least 4 years after it came out because i hate sappy love stories. This is a tearjerker for sure. I will NEVER watch it again. Ever. Great movie, but i like to walk away with a huge smile on my face, not tear stained and hollow and thinking about life. But if you like movies like that, this is for you.

B001SS3JS8|3.0|While I did like this book, it was not one of my favourite Jodi Picoult books.<br /><br />There was just something about this book, and I still can't figure out what it is exactly, that I wasn't able to connect with.  The names drove me crazy.  I wasn't able to keep track of who was who and I had to keep going back to the beginning to remind myself who was who.  It also didn't help that there were these flashbacks that didn't really add to the story, in my opinion.<br /><br />What I did love is that once again Jodi made me believe in a situation that was so far-fetched.  Do I think that a suicide pact is far-fetched?  No, I don't.  But the way that the one in this book plays out is.  Even after having read the book twice, I still don't know the reason it happened in the first place.  Not to mention, that Emily, who comes up with the idea never gives a reason for her wanting to commit suicide, not even to Chris who ends up being the surviving member of the pact.  Even though he is never given a reason a reason, Chris decides to end his life simply because he can't see his life being worth living without her in it.  To me, that isn't realistic at all and that is where Jodi Picoult's talent really comes in.  While I may not have believed in the circumstances, she did have me believing in the characters.

1606863622|5.0|I have seldom been as  moved by a book of fiction as I was by the book Dear John.

I cried for a long time!  This is a MUST read, if you love someong deeply or ever have done so.

B002ZG99QS|3.0|Tron Legacy (2011) is a worthy successor to the Disney movie it eulogizes, bringing up to date the cinematography and CGI visuals that made the original such a breakout movie. Jeff Bridges, Olivia Wilde, and Beau Garrett put in terrific performances and Bruce Boxleitner gamely stands in as the corporate good guy who provides a tangible link between the past and the present.     The plot of Tron Legacy, with some notable exceptions, is almost identical to the plot of the original. E.g., a User is beamed into the game grid of a rogue server and he fights his way across the electronic landscape in lightcycles and other vehicles to the uplink so he can return to the real world to put things to right. A megalomaniac administrative program stands in his path, unwittingly doing the bidding of his corporate masters by keeping Flynn out of the way while they plot their evil machinations on the unsuspecting public.    It helps to put things in context by understanding that Tron Legacy is not really a sequel. It is true that the in-movie gap of twenty-nine years is the same as it is in real life and that some aspects of the plot extend from the original. But Tron Legacy is more of an homage, and not just to Tron (1982), but to a number of other science fiction classics of the last forty years. Obvious homage sequences include a turret defense scene with Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) taken from Star Wars 4: A New Hope (1977) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003), an extended bar scene with Zuse (Michael Sheen) taken from The Matrix Reloaded (2003), and the movie's final scene taken from Bladerunner (1982), itself ironically an invention of the Warner Brothers bosses implemented over the vehement objections of Ridley Scott.    The visual effects are sumptuous and detailed, lavishly created by Digital Domain studios and mothered over by the director (and former architect) Joseph Kosinksi. It is here where Tron Legacy excels, from innovative lightcycle designs to stunning background detail that includes clouds, lightning, myriad buildings and structures, and a digital shoreline. The effects immerse the viewer in the Tron universe, drawing us in and filling the imagination with the possibilities of more. Although the visual effects of the original movie are mocked in the modern era, most forget that they were quite revolutionary for its time. It was one of the first movies that abandoned matte paintings and model miniatures in favor of fully digitized sequences with live-action performers. It was Tron that helped Hollywood understand the potential of CGI film making, and it set the stage for The Last Starfighter (1984), a movie in which fully a quarter of the running time was shot in CGI. Tron ultimately made movies like The Matrix (1999) and Lord of the Rings (2001) possible, and in Tron Legacy thirty years of CGI artistry comes to its full potential.    Jeff Bridges brings to bear his considerable skill, acquired in the intervening decades between the Tron installments. He plays three characters in the movie (current day self, self fourteen years earlier, and his alter-ego CLU, a rebel program in the Grid), two of them digitized to look younger, and he really stands out in the persona of his older self untainted by the touch of graphic artists. The much ballyhooed digital head animations look stiff and unnatural in spite of Bridge's art. This was done considerably better in The Social Network (2010) (the simulation of the Winklevoss twins), albeit not a full digitization. Nevertheless it was nice to see Bridges take his role seriously, something that he clearly did not in the original Tron. Olivia Wilde, an actress better known as a doctor in the TV series House (2007-2011), is wonderful as the self-evolved program Quorra, bringing together the necessary child-like innocence, conflicted loyalties, and subsurface femininity that the role requires. Former Guess model Beau Garrett has a wonderful cameo as the duplicitous program Gem and Bruce Boxleitner reprises his role as Kevin Flynn's partner Alan Bradley. Although Boxleitner also played the title character Tron in the original movie, he does not in Tron Legacy.    Michael Sheen gamely plays bar owner Zuse with a foppish flare, clearly intended as comic relief. Sheen (no relation to Martin Sheen and his brood) is an accomplished stage actor with an impressive resume in both TV and film, but here he is horribly miscast. In fact the casting of Sheen is so bad it actually makes the otherwise fine performances of the rest of the cast look unnecessarily wooden and stiff. Considering that casting was done by Heike Brandstatter, Sarah Finn, and Coreen Mayrs, a trio associated with a lengthy list of schlock, kids movies, and comic book adaptations, one should not be overly surprised. The same role was done to supreme effect by Lambert Wilson in The Matrix Reloaded and Kosinski would have done better to cast an actor similar to Wilson that could pull off the comedic qualities required without disrupting the feel of the movie.    Garrett Hedlund is typecast (see also Troy (2004), Friday Night Lights (2004), and Eragon (2006)) as the young and virile, but rudderless, stud son Sam Flynn. He works his way through the lines of his character with the necessary gravity and seriousness, thereby avoiding the type of damage that Sheen does to the film, but is not really up to the part. In spite of Jeff Bridges being on board the Sam Flynn character was the one role that would make or break the film. Hedlund does neither, clearing the way for the movie to make a profit, but doing little to keep critics from excoriating the movie. A performance that properly conveyed the anguish of a son abandoned by his father only to find the man immersed in the environment he preferred would have elevated Tron Legacy from mere fanboy film to an award worthy sequel that may have spawned new movies in the same milieu. Alas, it was not to be.    The music is a synthesized compilation by Daft Punk and does a good job of enhancing the modern, but moody, atmospherics of the film. The modernity of the Daft Punk soundtrack is even more startling after the hearing the silly early 1980s hits screeching out of the jukebox in the Flynn video arcade at the beginning of the movie, and it is with some relief when Garrett Hedlund closes the door behind him before descending down to the secret computer lab underneath.    The script is just awful, albeit at the same quality level as the original movie. Stereotypical and hackneyed dialogue march their way through the plot, encompassing everything from things that evil corporate executives say to the pseudo-mysticism mouthed by Bridges in justification for his abandonment of his son, employees, and family. The plot itself, although basically the same as in Tron, rejects the original subtext of industry-rampant intellectual property theft in favor of the anti-capitalist, pro-anarchic sympathies popular in the Hollywood of 2011.    The ham-handedness of the writing might cause the viewer to overlook some nevertheless interesting plot elements. Quorra represents a digital offspring of sorts of Kevin Flynn, and he gives her to his flesh-and-blood son Sam to take with him back to the real world. Kevin Flynn clearly prefers his digital world over that of the non-digital world, and who is to say that one world is more real than the other? But he needs an agent to work on his behalf in the non-digital world so he can perpetuate the conditions necessary to continue to work in the isolated environment of the Grid. In the end he chooses to stay in the Grid during the escape of his progeny in spite being able to escape with them. His continued presence means the destruction of CLU and the Orwellian world the rebel program had created, and in this destruction the Grid is swept clean and returned to the blank canvas he needs to start anew.     The movie was a resounding commercial success, with a world-wide box office of $400 million versus a production budget of $170M. Considering marketing costs, merchandising, video game sales, and the movie chain take, it made a tidy profit for Disney. The original Tron booked $33 million at the box office versus a $17 million budget. Even accounting for 29 years of inflation, the second movie did better than the first. But Tron Legacy was not an unqualified success, so it is unlikely the franchise will see another installment for another thirty years. Still, Tron Legacy did serve to fire the imaginations of a new generation of kids who will, like those that saw Tron in 1982, inspire them to make innovative and visually alluring movies in the future. For that we can all be thankful.

B005J2UM9S|3.0|I am a huge fan of horror movies and ghost stories. I watched this movie a total of 2 times. The first time I watched it, I couldn't tell if it was really a comedy, really bad acting, or a parody of Ghost Adventures. I think it might be a combination. After the first 20 minutes or so, it takes a turn and actually becomes quite scary. The CGI in this movie is not very good. The idea is very good though. It could have been a lot better. But if you are a fan of horror movies you should watch this to judge for yourself.

1594202842|4.0|The complete subtitle of the book is: \\"This is a story about a mother, two daughters, and two dogs. This was supposed to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones. But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory, and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old.\\"         From the exerpts that I had read from this book online, I was prepared not to like it and not to like Amy.  However, I really liked the book.  It is a well-written, open and honest sounding memoir.  Amy tells how she is raising her children in what she calls the Chinese way, which she feels is greatly superior to the lazy Western way of raising children.  Her younger daughter, however, rebelled completely at the age of 13 which made Amy have to re-think her parenting techniques and compelled her to write this book.  I think that Amy wrote it to try to justify to her girls how she raised them and to try to tell them how much she loves them and that she thinks she is acting this way to help them to reach their potential.      Most Western parents will find some of the things that Amy has said to her children and some of the things that she has made them do rather horrifying. She has micromanaged her daughter's lives and screamed at them to force them to practice piano and violin. Even when they travel, she finds places for them to practice their instruments and often also finds tutors to tutor them in practice sessions there as well.  She once refused to accept hand made birthday cards from her daughters telling them that the cards obviously had taken very little effort to produce and were thus an insult to her.  The girls later made nicer cards for her which she accepted.         I think there are some very positive things about Amy's parenting style.  She is very involved in her daughter's lives.  She sat through all of their piano and violin lessons with them, learning everything the instructors were teaching, taking notes, making drawings sometimes and studied music on her own as well, in order to help her daughters be succesful at playing their instruments.  Her application of that, however, is what most people would find to be too much - screaming at her daughters, not allowing them to take breaks, making them practice for up to 6 hours a day or more.         I do think that Western parents and the US school system are too lax and we should raise our expectations some, more like the Chinese parents do because children are more capable than we give them credit for and our education system is far behind those in some other countries.  I don't, however, recommend screaming at children and degrading them and taking away all free time like Amy did.

0062060554|5.0|Do NOT start reading \\"Before I Go To Sleep\\" in the afternoon like I did because you will NOT be able to go to sleep until you finish reading it.    I received an advance reader's copy of this book to review in the mail yesterday and picked it up and started reading it yesterday evening.  It was interesting, but then we had dinner and took the kids out for an evening swim and it was 9:30 before I really started reading again.  At 11:30 I was halfway through the book and I told my husband I could not go to sleep until I finished it.  He did not believe me.  He should have known better.  At 12:45 am, I finished the book and could go to sleep.    This book is an amazing psychological thriller!  Every day, Christine wakes up and does not know where she is.  She looks in the mirror and does not recognize herself, expecting to see herself at least 20 years younger.  Taped to the mirror are photos of herself and a man with labels to indicate that the older woman she sees in the mirror is indeed herself and the man she awoke with in her bed is her husband Ben.  Every morning Ben tells her that she has amnesia from an accident that she was in many years ago and that she forgets everything when she sleeps.  She receives a call on a cell phone, a device that she does not recognize since they did not exist 20 years earlier when she lost her memory, from her doctor, who tells her that she is keeping a diary in order to try to retrieve her memories and overcome her amnesia.  Her diary documents a smattering of memories - bits and pieces that have come to her on various days, that she has written down, although each and every morning, she awakes not knowing anything again.  By reading her diary, some of her memories return, and she begins to wonder why her loving husband, Ben is lying to her about many things.  Is he lying to protect her, or for some more nefarious reason?  The plot twists and is not what I was expecting.  This is an intense book, and I totally recommend it!  I think it could make a great movie too.  I am glad that I got an advance copy to review - it is just amazing!

I have read other reviews, but words cannot begin to describe what you hear and what you feel as you play this album, and it only gets better the more you hear it.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|great for calculations, and any other topic you have a question about. This is the new encyclopedia on steroids. even though the website is free, the app is convenient when I cant get to the pc to look something up.

1609611543|5.0|I've just been stunned after reading this book.   It's easy to read, easy to understand, and simply - shocking.   Why don't we already know this stuff?  Why is this modified 'food' allowed to be everywhere and we all live on it?  We need a new word for wheat because the stuff called wheat right now is not wheat.   It's something different and it's harmful to humans.   Dr. Davis has done a huge service here - I'm so grateful for this book.  Everyone who eats needs to read this, for themself and their families.
0061537969|5.0|I saw this book as a \\"staff pick\\" in a magazine. I was drawn to it but didn't immediately run out to buy it. Weeks passed and one saturday afternoon I made a trip the library to check it out. I read cover to cover in less that 4 hours, hardly putting it down for a break. I cried, and laughed, cried some more and laughed harder. So many wonderful live lessons in this story told by dear Enzo. Everyone can relate to this story of love, companionship, hope and family.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book if you have teens or you are a young adult. this is an amazing book which I have read at least 3 times in a month. the whole series is thoughtfully written, has great action, and a little bit of romance, which makes this book a perfect blend of different genres.   it is set in the future, where the capitol city is rich, but the 12 districts are poor, the 12th being the poorest. the different districts have to send a tribute of two children, a boy and a girl from their village to participate in the Hunger Games, a type of gladiatorial survival in an artificial battlefield. Katniss Everdeen, the main character, must face many dangers, and make great friends who help her until they are killed.
0823095223|5.0|This book is very detailed and written by three professional sculptors working in the toy industry.All the instructions are well written and illustrated with photos to clearly illustrate each step of the process of making a toy, they aren't stingy with information either they let you know their secrets and tried and true methods that they use.They include information on but not limited to,making an armature,sculpting,casting molds,creating an action figure with various forms of articulation,and painting the figure.This is the only book on making a toy I could find ,but its so good, I don't know how anybody could write another book to top it.

B000AQJPQE|2.0|This product is not what it seems.  When reading online one might think that it simply fits over or is the yellow globe of the ceiling light already in place, but this is not the case.  The old light must come down.  Then the problem is with the light.  Without an overhead light the room is going to be really dark.  The light that is produced through the sub is anything but sunny.  We still like the product for the educational value and it looks good enough, but it is a real problem when it comes to light.
0307887960|5.0|My wife and I started the Dukan diet on July 11, 2011. I am 65 years old and have been on many diets. I lost 30 lbs on Atkins and over a period of years, gained much but not all of it back. Some dietitians don't like the Dukan diet because it goes against all their education but the fact is that it works. You have to give up something to lose weight. I work out at a gym as I have for 35 years and I lost no strength on this diet and I am within the healthy limits for body fat, although at the upper limits. Before the diet I was in the obese category. I learned why cholesterol and trygliserides go up during dieting (released from body fat as fat is used up) which is something I have wondered about for many years. I would recommend this diet for anyone who is truly serious about losing weight but it is not for the faint hearted. I have lost 23 pounds in 9 weeks and my wife has lost 18. We were very tired and without energy for the first weeks but now have more energy and even agility from the weight loss. We are almost in the last phases, just a few more pounds. I never thought I would get tired of eating meat but now I appreciate the days when we can eat vegetables. I have not had so much as a cookie since July 10 but we eat low fat yogurt and fat free pudding cups. One diviation from the diet is that we eat oatmeal for breakfast and we add the required oatbran to the oatmeal. We drink more than the required volume of liquids including artifically sweetened drinks and lots of water.I made up a summary of the diet so we can refer to it but now we seldom look at it. It will be interesting to see if we can keep the weight off once we complete the diet.Isn't it amazing that we are so blessed in the USA that we must avoid food while so much of the world is trying to find something to eat? They are not hearing, \\"Do you want fries with that?\\" and the wife is not asking \\"Does this dress make me look fat?\\"

B003YL4LYI|1.0|I just finished A Dance w/Dragons with a profound sense of disappointment.  I kept reading this book hoping that after setting up the mail plot points, George RR would close out the book with monumental outburst of action, violence, battle and intriguing plot twists.  But. Nothing. Ever. Happens.<br /><br />I loved Game of Thrones--the best fantasy book I've read since LOTR, and Clash of Kings held my rapt attention, especially with Tyrion's Machiavellian nature and the way he systematically outmaneuvered his sister and bent everyone to his will; and the series momentum, to large extent, was continued with Storm of Swords--though there were troubling sections in that book that led me to wonder what the author was thinking. (However, I thought the climatic duel between the Red Viper of Dorne and The Mountain was a tour de force--I keep re-reading that section hoping for a different outcome of the fight and always coming away disappointed.  That's great story telling!)<br /><br />However, Feast & Dance  should never have been written in their current form--or preferably not at all. Will somebody tell Tyrion where whores go?  Yes, I get it--Jon Snow knows nothing.  Jaime, did you know Cersei has been screwing Lancel & Osmund?  One can cut 100 pages of text simply by removing all food references.  If you remove all reminisces you could cut another 100 pages.  Good lord!  Did anybody edit this train wreck?  Instead it's up to the reader to assess whether or not a paragraph is worthy of being read and then skipping to the next paragraph if the answer is \\"no\\" (which happens all too often--the vast majority of this book is mere \\"fill\\" the purpose of which is to extend the life of this series).<br /><br />George--what happened, man?  Was it the money?  Vanity?  Who was responsible for deciding to turn this trilogy into a 7 book series? Are all the later books going to be 1000+ pages?  Are you being paid by the word?  Did you really think your fans would be interested in what Tyrion had for breakfast, lunch, and dinner while playing chess floating on a barge down some river to join Daenerys--day after boring & uneventful day?  You might have pulled it off if they had joined forces in the end, but we were denied any resolution to this intriguing story line.<br /><br />Daenerys was one of my favorite character in the first three books; I loved it when she slowly changed from a frightened girl into a leader and conqueror in her own right; but in Dance she does NOTHING (unfortunately like all the other characters).  The Daenerys in Storm crucified 163 Great Masters in Meereen when they sufficiently provoked her, yet she seems reluctant to do what is necessary to stop the Sons of the Harpy.  Chapter after chapter and she does nothing.  Lots of internal dialogue, reminisces, and angst, but she does NOTHING.  At the end when she FINALLY rides Drogon, she still manages to do NOTHING.<br /><br />The beheading of the main protagonist in Game of Thrones was a brilliant stroke that riveted me and left me gasping to find out what happens next; but, George, you've gone to that well too many times--the shock value of killing off a main character has lost its power and now it looks like a desperate move to regain your magic.  [spoiler alert!] Jon Snow was never one of my favorite characters, but why give him the Caesar treatment in a ludicrous plot twist that undercut the only interesting thing he was about do (march on Winterfell)?  Or is he really dead?  After all, Westeros is quickly turning into Zombieland.<br /><br />I know your stated reasons for killing off your characters, but you should know that because your penchant for mayhem This Reader now refuses to invest any emotional energy and identify with any of the characters for fear they'll be stabbed, shot, poisoned, or otherwise butchered at their wedding.  I know there are no heroes in real life, but that's why I read fantasies--to escape real life for brief periods of time--not to have my heroes torn down and my nose rubbed in the nitty gritty detail of life in medieval times.<br /><br />And this brings me to another disturbing point:  George--you're starting to creep me out with your sex scenes.  From the start I was uncomfortable with girls being married off at twelve or thirteen, or whenever they \\"flower\\"; it's now getting dangerously close to kiddie porn and I think you should back away from writing any more sex scenes involving girls.  You have to be an writer of exceptional power (think Nobokov's \\"Lolita\\") to pull off this delicate subject matter, and as good a writer as you are, you are not that good.<br /><br />I'm sorry for venting; I guess I'm really very upset that a series like Ice & Fire that started off with such promise should get derailed so badly.  George--you could have been one of the greats, but you threw it all away for another sack of money.  My advice: do a DO OVER.  Go back and pretend book #4 & 5 never happened and pick up the story from the end of book #3, apologize to your fans for wasting their time & money, ask them to burn their copies of Feast & Dance, and then wrap up the series in another book or two (maximum of 500 pages each), and do it in the next year or two; no more 5-6 year gaps.  If you cannot summon up the energy to get this series concluded, just release the main plot points in a Black Lightning format and let your fan base take over the series.  You're burned out.roes torn down and my nose rubbed in the nitty gritty detail of life in medieval times.<br /><br />And this brings me to another disturbing point:  George--you're starting to creep me out with your sex scenes.

B00466HM28|2.0|There are a handfull of options when looking for a small form factor midi controllers, if key action or pad responsiveness is important to you I wouldn't put this at the top of the list. The keys action is \\"squishy\\" like pushing down on a piece of rubber even for a controller this size, I've used thrift store casio synths that had better feeling keys than this unit. The velocity maxes out at a medium level of keypress so you have to play extra gently if you want any sort of dynamics in your playing. The pads are just shy of useless with almost the exact opposite problem you must hit them extra hard for a hit to register. I often find it misses hits and even double triggers hits, so I never use them, not what I expected from the makers of the MPC. The pots work great (incidentally they were the reason i chose this over other options) they have a good solid feel to them and work without issues, and the size of the unit is nice, but none of these were enough to keep me from replacing it with a micro controller I'm much happier with.

It's not nearly as complex as the above mentioned, however it's a good quick read. I enjoyed it and would read additional books if the author decided to make a series out of it.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|In 1973 ABC debut a television series that would become a pop culture phenomenon of the 1970's, \\"The Six Million Dollar Man\\".

014241493X|5.0|It made me laugh and kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was a mystery novel without fitting into the confines of a typical mystery.  As usual John Green creates a unique story line with real characters you can relate to.

B003NX75B8|4.0|I have read all the other John Green books and liked this one the least, although I still liked it.  It wasn't as funny to me as the others, although I thought the characters felt real and the storyline was good.  There just wasn't as many laugh out loud moments for me, which to me make all of John Green's other books.
B004EPYZZI|4.0|The story is dramatic as well as tragic, but the recovery because of her faith, and her willingness to help others are remarkable. Her family support is wonderful.
B001KQEE0U|5.0|I dont understand how this album can only be rated 4 and a half stars,when u guys got his first and 2nd album rated at the same level. This clearly took hip hop to a whole \\"nother \\" level. Its the 1st rap double to ever be released...who would think to do something like that. He was just gettin out of jail and we were patiently waiting to hear from this man and he drops a double disc. Come on man...2pac? All eyez on me is the best rap album of all time.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|\\"Loud\\" by Rihanna is very fun to listen to.  The songs on this \\"Loud\\" collection are up-tempo and enjoyable to listen to.  My favorite song on this collection by Rihanna is \\"Cheers (Drink to That)\\" with Avril Lavigne.  I enjoyed the \\"Cheers\\" song because it sent a message to strive to be happy and have fun regardless of what others think or say about you.  This meaning is essential to hear because it is more beneficial for overall well-being to avoid concerning oneself with what others may think of them.  I say this more from a more aware perspective because I have personally found that others are going to think and/or say whatever they want regardless of personal joy level.  Therefore, living your life towards what feels joyful is more important than being concerned about gossip.  The \\"Cheers\\"  musical track communicates this theme very well.  \\"Loud\\" by Rihanna is great to get if you enjoy any of Rihanna's songs, especially \\"Umbrella\\" and/or \\"Drive\\".  This is due to the fact that Rihanna's music on this cd is in the same upbeat spirit as those two songs.
B0054N73EY|1.0|Enough has been said about the music and musicianship. Good stuff. The problem I have, like many others, is the compression making it virtually unlistenable. An unfortunate trend started by suits who don't have a hot clue as to what the hell they're doing.
B0052YAKS6|5.0|\\"Nothing But the Beat\\" by David Guetta is a very exciting and happy cd that has dance, pop, and electronica music tones in many of the musical tracks.  What I enjoy the most about this cd is that David Guetta  has the courage in pushing the musical envelope with the musical tracks and the artists that he chose to collaborate with.  For example he teams up with Snoop Dogg for the daring club track of \\"Sweat\\".  He does the very risqu&eacute; and catchy \\"Little Bad Girl\\" with Taio Cruz and Ludacrais.  The musical track that is \\"Lunar\\" (with Afrojack) is also very good and unique.  However, my personal top three favorite tracks are \\"Night of Your Life\\" (with Jennifer Hudson), \\"Titanium\\" (with Sia), and \\"Turn Me On\\" (featuring Nicki Minaj).  \\"Night of Your Life\\" is a provocative musical track about someone mentioning how they intend to give a memorable night to their date as long as they are treated right.  \\"Titanium\\" is a fantastic musical gem about being emotionally strong  (a.k.a  psychologically bulletproof) even in the face of whatever judgement and/or treatment is projected outward.  My overall favorite song is \\"Turn Me On\\" (featuring Nicki MinaJ).  \\"Turn Me On\\" is an intense musical track about wanting to spend time with a crush and/or romantic interest.  \\"Nothing But the Beat\\" by David Guetta is a great cd for anyone that enjoys an eclectic range of music that contains a creative combination of electronica, dance, and pop music.
0375826742|5.0|A very exciting and book of the Inheritance Cycle.  Waiting for the final book in the series due in November.
B0055EDBIE|5.0|\\"Black and White America\\" by Lenny Kravitz is a good quality cd that is filled with electic music.  My two favorite songs on \\"Black and White America\\" are \\"Sunflower\\" (featuring Drake) and \\"Rock Star City Life\\".  \\"Sunflower\\" (featuring Drake) is a unique song that is about someone that brings happiness and fun into a person's life.  \\"Sunflower\\" denotes being in love with someone that is part of the sunshine of life.  \\"Rock Star City Life\\" is a musical track about someone who has a zest for life.  \\"Black and White America\\" is good for anyone who enjoys a diverse range of music on their cd.
B0015AARJI|2.0|I recieved a new dualshock 3 controller and i was shocked to see that it was of poor quality. 2 of the screws did not lock in correctly and fell out after light shacking. As a result the controller was not secured properly and the top and bottom halves were not as close as they should be. The controller lights that indicate which channel the controller is on were raised and out of frame with the front face of the controller. All said this is the last time I will ever buy a controller via amazon. The quality is very poor, Sony may be to blame but Amazon is suffering because of it.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Don't be fooled by Monster cables or other high-brand options.  These cheap HDMI cables are just as good of quality and very durable.

B003K16P3M|2.0|Not a terrible book, I mean I could force my self to finish it... The book is boring and terribly unoriginal. There is very little character building outside of the main two characters, the antagonist is boring and I did not really care when he was defeated. It really is just poor writing and a poor storyline. The author took a tired overused story line and did not even write it well.
1451629184|5.0|This was a very intense book. It really helped you to see what she went through while being held captive. He brainwashed her to the point where she felt like she wanted to stay, needed to stay. It's amazing to think that her two girls lived their entire lives in that back yard, never knowing any different. I can't believe how many times she could have been saved and wasn't. The book bounces around a little, she goes off on tangents here and there and sometimes it leaves you wondering, but for the most part she comes back and answers those questions you had. Obviously this doesn't cover her entire life in that back yard because no one would want to read that, and because it appears as though after a while life took on a normal feeling for her without the same kind of drama she once endured. It's a heartbreaking book and you can see her struggle with the most simple things and the amount of fear she had when she was released. Definitely recommend if you're interested in what happened while she was being held captive. Jaycee is a VERY strong person, I'm not sure I could have survived all that she went through.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|OK, look...I'd love to see the original films put to Blu Ray as much as anyone, but if Lucas were GOING to do that, he would have done that already! The bottom line is, this is the Star Wars saga on Blu Ray...I mean come on!  There are alternatives in getting the original films on DVD the way they were theatrically released (see eBay on any given day), and if you are like me you probably have every frickin version ever made on every format made, so you are covered.  But pass up on the Star Wars BluRay release over some purist wishlist - that's not gonna happen.  It deserves at least 4 stars just because regardless of anything else, it's going to be the best HD transfer out there of a great cinematic series.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Loved this game and never had any issues until recently.  Game will no longer load on my phone, when it never had issues before.  Will change my one star rating once problem is fixed.
B0036KWNCY|5.0|When the Cars entered the music scene they were part of the New Wave music that would become the dominant music of the 80's.  However, as has frequently happened with respect to music, New Wave became the New Pop as pop music realigned itself with the influences of New Wave.  As the 80's drew to a close, New Wave began to sound like old hat and a little dated as the newness wore off the no longer novel sound of synthesizers imitating a host of instruments, with occasional sound effects.<br /><br />The Cars released \\"Heartbeat City\\" in 1984 as pop was starting to realign itself to the influence of New Wave.  Change is not accepted well by many people and thus this album was not well-received by some of the Cars earliest fans, who saw it as more pop than New Wave.  However, if you take this album and pretend it was released in 1980, it would not have been considered pop and would have been another then sort of counter-culture album.<br /><br />So when you read reviews, consider whether the writer is being objective regarding the album or whether they are expressing their opinion of how the album was received by the public at the time.  If you are a rebel in any era, the last thing you want to hear is that one of your icons was accepted by \\"The Establishment.\\"<br /><br />Forgetting the context of when the album was released, this album is classic New Wave 80's music.  Several of the songs are instantly recognizable as pop classics that will forever be among the greatest pop songs ever recorded, albeit with a 1980's New Wave flavor.<br /><br />Probably the three most readily recognizable of the songs are \\"Drive,\\" which would be a great song in any era, \\"Magic,\\" which also has a truly great video to go with it, and \\"You Might Think.\\"<br /><br />As you move away from these well-known songs, the other songs are classic Cars, with Ric Ocasek's voice often taking the lead vocal.  Among the remaining songs, I especially like \\"It's Not the Night,\\" a song about a couple where one of the two is getting ready to break up, but the other one wants the couple to stay together.

0307948560|2.0|This is a story of a full-time executive who is also a mom, wife, and martyr. She is busy, rushed, and frantic all the time with a staunch refusal to delegate.  That is the entire story, it never changes, and never evolves into any decent character portrayal.  This book falls flat.
0240815807|5.0|Very well written, it's an excellent book that serves extraordianlly well its purpose: teach the small studio owner how to get the best mixes on a budget. Many cool tricks, all the general observations, some of them I personaly didn't know, or simply used to forget too often... Highly highly recommended!!

I'd like to watch hd versions of the films I fell in love with the first time around(remember, the ones that fund your billionaire existence). I didn't like the prequel films much and I used to be able to pretend they never existed - but then you made me call the original films episodes 4 to 6, and then you've stuck Hayden Christiansen in at the end. Now you've now gone and spoilt the brilliant scene at the end to ROTJ. George, you might not have noticed, but you've surrounded yourself with cretinous 'yes' men like Rick Mcallum who are afraid to tell you when you've got it horribly wrong. To quote a certain princess we both know, 'If money is all you love, then that's what you will receive'... Then I'll give you my money when you finally release the films I love. PS. I'm fairly certain HD versions of your films will be 'appearing' on the internet minus your changes fairly soon. Think of all that $$$ you're going to miss out on!!

1612130585|5.0|After reading Fifty Shades of Grey I anxiously awaited the sequel Fifty Shades Darker.  Ms. James does not disappoint.  From the initial glimpse of Christian's horrific childhood to yet another cliffhanger of an ending FSD is a roller coaster ride of excitement and emotion.  Every twist and turn, sudden drop and occasional upside down, including Ana and Christian's re-union, gun toting ex subs, Elena, crazy bosses and amazing KF, kept me  holding on!  I loved that the emails, witty conversation, and the inner goddess and subconscious continued-they add so much to the story and give great insight into Ana.  Ms James is an amazingly visual writer.  You can actually see the Seattle skyline from Escala and Charlie Tango, the sunset over the Sound, the characters and the clothing.(I can just picture Kate walking into that bar after returning from Barbados!)  You can feel the emotions-as Ana is able to touch Christian, Ana's fear and strength with Leila and Jack and when Christian goes thermonuclear fifty.   One of my favorite part of this series is watching Ana and Christian grow as individuals and a couple as they journey in their relationship.    Christian says \\"There is a fine line between pleasure and pain\\".  Fifty Shades Darker is 100% pleasure.  I can not wait for Book 3.

B004T5R2HQ|4.0|It works on my EVO 3D. The images are limited to camera phone capability and not as clear as a regular scanner. Scanned images are in jpg & pdf graphics formats, but you have to be able to find the jpg files. When the software detects the edges of the documents, is not 100% accurate all the time, but the edges can be adjusted manually. I would not use this software to scan a document that can be scanned by a regular scanner. However, I do find it useful for creating an on-device version of posters and billboards I walk by, or anything that won't fit on a scanner.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I fell in love with The Decemberists years ago.  \\"Red Right Ankle\\" has long been my favorite song.  Unfortunately, their last two albums--one or two songs aside-- have been a disappointment.  I was beginning to lose faith. The King Is Dead refutes all doubts and brings me back into the fold.  Every song gets replayed into memorization and makes me long for the days when I had a long commute and could sing along in off-key ecstasy.
1573229725|5.0|This has become my favorite book of all time. I do have to admit there are some parts that feel slow, and of course, repeated, but I finished this book 2 weeks ago and I still can't think of anything else. I am haunted. Waters writes with such detail, maybe a little too over the top, but thats just what makes this book so amazing; engraving. The characters are so human, I feel like they are real people in my life, friends, and when I think about them, I have to remind myself they are only characters in a book. I not crazy. But thats just how amazing this book is. I almost wish I hadn't read it, because nothing will be able to satisfy me as much as this book, everything else is just, lifeless, and plotless. Whats in even better is that there is a movie to this book, so the adventure doesn't stop when your done with the reading.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|When I went to play the DVD the picture went in and out.  Then when it got to where you have to select Play, it started the movie, then went back to making me select Play again.  During the movie it stopped and then about 15 seconds later it would start again.  Half way through the movie it stopped and I couldn't get it out of my DVD player for 5 minutes until it started again.  It's not my DVD player.  I had that checked out and there was nothing wrong with the DVD player.  Because there was a note with the shipment that it could be returned only if unopened, I threw it out. I have played several DVD after that and never experience any problems with any of them.  I wouldn't say it was Amazon fault.  It was more of a production malfunction.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|I was glued to this book from page one...until about 3/4 of the way through.  It went from being compelling and well-written to...just a story about a woman who lets something that happened long ago(and not even to her) destroy her marriage. I was irritated by the choices she was making.  I don't think so much time should have been devoted to the fact her marriage failed.  It just didn't fit in with the original story.  It didn't need to be there.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Very entertaining well told sci-fi story, that weaves 80s/90s pop culture into a bleak future. One of the most entertaining and easiest reads I've encountered in a long time. Ernest Cline has a bright future in fiction.
1402238843|4.0|When I'm in the mood for a lighthearted and witty read, I know I can always count on author Georgette Heyer, the queen of Regency romances, to deliver!<br /><br />Heyer is quite fantastic at writing charming heroines and Venetia Lanyon is no exception. She is the eldest of three and sole caretaker of the family home at Undershaw and of her youngest brother, Aubrey. She has never traveled, can count the number of people she's met on two hands, and is doggedly pursued by two local boys who desperately want her hand in marriage. When she meets Lord Dameral one day while out for a walk (and quite a first meeting it was!), she can't help but wonder who the real man is behind the scandalous reputation. As circumstances force them together their friendship grows, despite the warning's that Venetia stay clear of the infamous rake. What ensues is lovely story of following one's own heart and finding true love. And though I adored Venetia and Lord Dameral, who I really loved the most was Aubrey...he seriously had me laughing out loud at times!<br /><br />I've heard so many people raving about Venetia recently, and now I can see what they were talking about! Venetia is now ranked among my favorite Heyer reads and if you're a fan too, this is one you won't want to miss!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This new release proves, beyond a doubt, that George Lucas has grown to abhor the first trilogy. No wonder he once called Star Wars a curse. If we were to look back at his career, the films that made him billions, the films that guranteed his place in cultural history were films that were NOT his complete vision. They were the product of a team of people with their own thoughts, their own views and their own input that made the original trilogy what they were...Cinematic history. The most obvious validation to this point are the Prequels. They are, without a doubt, unwatchable. I could not even bare to watch the fan re-edits. They are so terrible that it is best to ignore them outright or see them as an alternate universe, an alternate origin story. Oh and George Lucas had FULL control of those three films, no wonder he obssess over them and is willing to butcher the originals. And he goes beyond that...he donwright refuses to release the originals in the new format, that sounds like hate to me, hate of a product he was not in full control of.    I was so excited when I heard the original trilogy was coming out on blu ray, I was going to accept the '97 version...but not now. Not with yet another revision, the bastardization of an iconic scene. That's enough for me, there is no need to revise my experience of the films.    I for one, will not waste my money on this hate-filled revision, this bastardization of a classic film.    For those that argue \\"how can you rate something that hasn't been released yet\\"? This blu ray is a RE-RELEASE, and we already know what we are getting.
0156027321|3.0|My best friend recommended this book to me a couple years ago.  The cover looked interesting as did the premise, and it was a pretty popular book so I decided to take a look.  I read it through, decided I didn't know what to think of it, and now a couple years later have come back to it.  I'm still not quite sure what to think of it, but I honestly wasn't that fond of it.<br /><br />Pi is a young Indian boy growing up in the french settled area of India.  His father is a zookeeper and young Pi roams around the zoo and to various religious practitioners spending his day with animals and those of the faith of Muslim, Christian, and Hindu.  He is a practitioner of all three and believes this is fine for him.  When his family decides to move to Canada, they board a boat along with some of the zoo animals who are going to be going to zoos in America.  But the boat sinks and Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a zebra, hyena, orangutan, and large tiger known as Richard Parker.  He has to figure out how to survive until rescue, but with the wild animals aboard too, the odds are against him.<br /><br />Since Pi is the main focus of the novel, I expected to like him more.  But I found him kind of annoying and really wasn't that sympathetic to his plight.  In fact, I was rooting more for the tiger and the zebra than I was for Pi.  The tiger was definitely the best character of the novel.  In its wildness it was interesting, and the concept of it on the lifeboat was unique.<br /><br />The whole book moved very slowly.  There was a lot of intro information in the beginning that could have been skipped straight through.  Sure it probably helped explain Pi's character, but it just seemed to stretch forever with no real added value.  The part on the lifeboat also moved slowly and I got tired of the details of the sun and salt and what he had to eat.  Granted there wasn't a whole ton of action to be had in a lifeboat, but describing the minute just made it that more excruciating.  I also wasn't fond of the way Martel did the end, instead of letting the reader make the connections of figure out what the story meant, he pretty much just handed it to us and told us to choose which version we like better.  Which is kind of a cop out to me.  I know must of this sounds terrible and you're probably wondering why I rated the book as high as three stars.  Well, when he's not waxing on and on with detail, the writing actually is very good.  Its clear, precise, and somewhat lyrical and I wouldn't mind reading other books by the author if they didn't move so slowly.  The concept of the book too was exciting.<br /><br />I do have to comment on this author's boast in the foreward that says the story contained within this book can turn people to religion.  I did not find it so, in fact I skipped over the parts on religion as I found them irrelevant to the story as a whole.  I did like that this book was based on a true story (according to the author's foreward) as that made it a little more exciting.  But its still a heavy boast to claim that this story will lead people to God.<br /><br />Not the great piece of literature I was expecting but not worth throwing in the trash heap either.  I can see why different people would enjoy this book, it just wasn't for me.<br /><br />Life of Pi<br />Copyright 2001<br />319 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B0050XFY4O|4.0|I think the mere premise of this movie is enough to award it some positive feedback. It's a movie that's heartwarming and uncomfortable at the same time. I recommend it for someone looking for something different and someone who has a very open mind. As some reviewers have noted, there's a certain lack of depth in the film... and especially in the last half, it's especially cosmetic. A lot of skin (not always a bad thing), but not much substance. I recommend it, though-- you will never see a movie like this in the U.S. ... which is an unfortunate reality.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|You don't watch this film for horror flick thrills or science fiction marvels. You watch this movie to laugh. You'll be rewarded over and over by this smart, fresh, and delightfully surprising film.    As for the whining about which films it's ripping off, if they were this funny I'd feel bad for them. They weren't and this one is. End of discussion. See this film.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This is a great movie with a fantastic message.  You don't have to have read the comic book as a kid to enjoy the show.  Steve Rogers is a good man with morals and character.  How refreshing to see someone that you can look to as a hero that does not have a personal agenda or seeks for fame or personal glory.  Great for the entire family.  I already pre-ordered this on DVD, can't wait until it arrives.

Along with many strategic promotional and sales techniques you don't just sound your own horn you also lift others up. This Is the way I see Amazon Forum. None of us are alone. When we have questions and difficulties our peers guide us along the path.<br />I am not saying everyone will give the best advice but as on Amazon you have shown that together we all can reach most any publishing goal we go after.  Thank you again<br /><br />I wish you many years of success.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|DC Comics, Hasbro and other Marvel Comics productions NOT involving CAPTAIN AMERICA take note... CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER got it right - THIS is how you make a superhero movie!!<br /><br />1) DO humanize your hero but not by creating disgusting habits in him (Iron Man) - rather by presenting him as the personified goodness all humans possess but infrequently act on. DON'T turn him into a total pathetic wuss and moronic jerk at the beginning only to turn the improbable light switch for him to become the hero he's supposed to be.<br />2) DO showcase the central character in ALL his comic book glory and yes, a little patriotic flag waving doesn't hurt. Um, he is suppeosed to be an AMERICAN hero after all not just a \\"citizen of the world.\\" DON'T be ashamed of the golden legacy that turned an imagined character into an enduring icon of American culture. (Superman Returns and Smallville - I'm thinking of you.)<br />3) DO stick to ONE story thread and carry it to completion. DON'T try to \\"add depth and diversity\\" by intoducing a bunch of superfluous characters that only serve to create a mess (Green Lantern, G.I. Joe and again, Smallville).<br />4) DO give the superhero a supervillain worthy of him. DON'T save the good stuff for a planned sequel because if your original movie sucks, the sequel becomes very unlikely (Superman Returns - Spacey's version of Lex Luthor was laughable and not in a good way. The first Hulk - his own father???)<br />5) DO bring out the trumpets and flurries for a memorable theme song. DON'T rely on cheesy heavy metal \\"music\\" (Matrix movies).<br />6) DO allow the superhero to fall long and hard for the ONE true love of his life and vice versa. DON'T create insanely obnoxious girly pointless melodrama (Spider-Man, Superman Returns and Smallville). On similar note, DO present the hero's LOVE and soulmate in all her stellar glory as his one and only equal - SHOW it, DON'T just say it.<br />7) DO frame the hero in stunning action sequences in all his head to toe uniformed glory (Tom Welling, PLEASE take note). DON'T pick an actor to play said hero if he's going to refuse to wear the suit by trying to hide behind a lame ass excuse such as \\"it's more interesting to show what happend in the character's life before he became the hero we know him to be.\\" DON'T, DO NOT disrespect your audience by presuming to tell us what to think. If you're going to film the Statue of Liberty, doesn't it make sense that the audience expects to actually SEE the Statue of Liberty and not a blurry CGI version of it or just a close up of the head?<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is quite simply, THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE.

B003OUXECE|3.0|BioShock: Rapture will please fans of the BioShock games, but tries to incorporate too much story, too much history, and too many characters to make a real strong novel.  Anyone who has played the BioShock games, especially the first, knows that the strongest character is the city of Rapture itself.  Rapture is dripping (literally) with Art Deco style, propaganda posters, sweeping plazas decorated to excess, and cramped, impoverished rooms filled with blood-smeared walls and dead bodies.  Unfortunately, the city of Rapture itself is relatively absent from this novel, despite what its title would imply.  Perhaps this was done intentionally because anyone who has played the games already has a strong mental image of what the city should be and look like, but I was hoping to be transported back into Rapture by this novel and instead felt like I was just reading a history instead of living it.<br /><br />I was very excited about this book because I wanted to learn more about how this city came to be and was not disappointed by the opening quarter of the book.  Shirley does a great job of making you believe that building a city at the bottom of the ocean is possible, while balancing the different characters' motivations for leaving the surface, and their hopes and dreams for their new life under the sea.  However, as the novel goes on, more and more details are omitted as readers are dragged along on a crash-course towards Rapture's inevitable fall.  Ideally, this would be two or three novels that would have allowed the very capable Shirley to elaborate and further develop Rapture's many characters.  Instead, we charge through 14 years in a mere 430 pages which just is not enough time to tie off all of the story lines created.  It is really irritating as a reader to have a section end on a cliffhanger, only to jump one year into the future on the very next page with no mention of it again.<br /><br />As far as a book to supplement the great story and visuals showcased in the BioShock games, BioShock: Rapture is a decent read for fans.  As a stand-alone novel, not so great.  The pacing is way off, the lack of visual descriptions and large cast of characters left only halfway fleshed out leave a lot to be desired, and it is simply too ambitious for its own good.<br /><br />2.5/5 starsmes, BioShock: Rapture is a decent read for fans.  As a stand-alone novel, not so great.

0385737955|5.0|This book was incredible! It left me wondering and wanting more. My friend read this book and called it awfully boring, but I think just the opposite. A character who knows just as much as the reader, starting in a new place. It makes you wonder and ponder long after you put the book down, unless of course you can't put it down like me. I read it all day waiting to find the answers to the mysterious questions only finding more and more things to question. This book is a must read! There are surprising turns and a good plot. The characters are believable. How would you feel if you couldn't remember a thing, but knew you memory was just beyond your grasp? It makes me glad I don't live in a place like the Maze, and don't have to run 24/7 searching for something that I might never find.

Lonesome Dove is just a CLASSIC Western...Without question...but I also believe it to be a true Classic film (even though shot as a \\"mini-series\\").  It has it all!!!  And the combination of Duval & Tommy Lee...DAMN those boyz can put it together.  Although some may disagree, I think the only weakness, albeit small, was at the very end.  While profound...a bit abrupt for me.  But this is a solid 5 Star Classic.

B000EYK4GW|5.0|We were very happy with the Dumbo dvd we ordered from Amazon.  The movie arrived within 3 days, and it was in perfect condition.  Our grandchildren range in age from 6 to 2 and each one of them love the movie!  Thanks, Amazon!
0060775858|5.0|We have this must-have classic children's book in English and in Spanish, and we love it.  Somewhere around 18 months, my son began the hunt for the mouse, which cleverly appears somewhere different in every picture of the room... including one where he's snacking on the oatmeal.  And we call the old lady bunny Grandma Bunny which (for some reason) is also hilarious.  The book is full of objects that children see every day, and the pages with the object pictures help them learn what those things are (also great to learn Spanish).  And, of course, it's a natural segwey to saying good night to everything in the room and going to bed!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|i am looking forward to buying the dvd and watching at it as many times as i can, i cannot wait until it is out. wow!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It's really a bummer that we are getting such a lacking release after waiting so long for Star Wars to appear on Blu-Ray.  This could have been a great opportunity for Lucas to redeem himself after so many complaints about the previous DVD releases excluding the original versions of these great films (and the non-anamorphic special edition debacle).  There's really no excuse, there has been more than enough time to put together a complete package for blu-ray.  All we are asking for is new state-of-the-art 8k resolution transfers, and also the original versions that everyone grew up watching.  If George wants to keep making alterations to the special editions then fine by me, but that is no reason to exclude the originals altogether.  It seems obvious that they are holding out on us for the inevitable \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" down the line.  The bonus features on this set look good, but there is still so much lacking from this release that I would recommend either holding off for the next blu-ray release or purchasing this set Used on Amazon marketplace or eBay in a few weeks, as to at least make the point that this is really getting to be unacceptable.
B003L77GGK|2.0|The five year plan that Kripke had is over and you can tell.  This season had none of the backbone, the heart the other seasons had.  It is by far a miss compared to the first four season, back when I called this my favorite series.  I wanted it to be great, but each episode threw stuff at a wall hoping something would stick.  The heart which is the relationship of the brothers had failed.  They threw out the characters of Sam and Dean for unrecognizable doubles who forgot what made them different. What happened to Sam's powers.  I loved the Luke Skywalker/ Han Solo likeness of the first few seasons.  I loved when the boys where part of the mythos rather then powerless spectators.  Characters grow true, Sam was soulless but still this season just missed the target.  I hope the next season brings back the geeky Sam, the womanizing Dean and the heart of the series which is the brother wisecracking relationship.    Ben Edlund one of the best writers on television could not even put in a good episode.  So I hope they read the reviews and take some notes for S7.  They can still make a comeback and I am hoping they do.
B003ASLJRW|4.0|\\"Pale Rider\\" as others have pointed out has a lot of parallels with \\"Shane\\" although, in the case of Clint Eastwood's movie the main character Preacher (according to Eastwood)is a ghost (much like in \\"High Plains Drifter\\"). Although \\"Pale Rider\\" isn't quite up to the quality of \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\" it has a lot of memorable scenes in it.<br /><br />The religious overtones are quite deliberate according to interviews that Eastwood did at the time with biblical parallels throughout the film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of the movie although it has a new cover uses the same transfer as the previous Blu-ray and there's no extras to speak of except trailers for this film and \\"Unforgiven\\". The transfer looks good but not great--there's scenes where detail isn't quite as sharp as it should be and the compression/codec uses makes for a couple of unsteady images within the frame (for example the scene where a girl prays in the woods the bark appears a bit jittery in relation to the rest of the image or the sky when we first see the Preacher arriving into town with the snow covered mountains in the backdrop--the clouds jittery a bit).<br /><br />Blacks and skin textures look fine while the film itself has nice skin tones, colors, etc.<br /><br />Audio sounds quite good with a lossless presentation that isn't quite as bold as that for \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\".<br /><br />It's a pity this film doesn't get more love--it would be nice to see a featurette (even the vintage one produced around the time the film was produced)or short documentar/commentary track included as an extra here.<br /><br />Hopefully fairly soon we'll see a Blu-ray for \\"High Plains Drifter\\" one of Eastwood's finest westerns as a director with special features (although I wouldn't count on it--Universal is notorious for not providing a lot of extras for their catalog titles--a good example being the recent reissue on Blu-ray of \\"Brazil\\")and maybe one of these days we'll see a deluxe edition for this fine underrated western.
0380820846|5.0|I first read this book when it was new, years and years ago and it has remained one of my favorites ever since (I have three copies of it if you doubt me).<br /><br />This book is Ms. Quinn at her best it's witty, romantic, and utterly captivating. I love that Lady Whistledown was someone completely unexpected, I loved that when she was unveiled by Colin my first thought was 'well that explains her fascination with the Bridgertons' quickly followed by 'now why didn't I ever suspect her'. Frankly when Lady Danbury was accused of being Lady Whistledown I actually suspected her too lol, but was pleasantly surprised instead.<br />I've re-read this book so many times that I've had to buy another copy because my first one fell apart and was being held together by tape (the third copy is because it received an updated cover and I wanted it :p). If you want to read a wonderful book that you could just fall in love with time and time again than this is it, but I recommend the other three before it first or you won't appreciate it nearly as much as you should.
0553801473|1.0|Don't bother because George Martin sure didn't bother to write anything worth reading. I can't imagine why an editor and the publisher accepted this work.
B004EPYZZI|4.0|Movie is great for family viewing. The very day we received our movie in the mail, my wife and I sat and watched it. Great story to teach your kids about never giving up no matter what challenges you face in life. The scenery was beautiful and the surfing scenes were action packed ballet on water. Both my wife and I give Soul Surfer Blu-ray two thumbs up!!!
0385737947|4.0|Wow. This book was absolutely amazing. Where do authors come up with these kinds of ideas??<br /><br />I went into this book not knowing what to expect. I had heard mixed reviews about it but was excited to read it myself. And to be honest, a book of this genre doesn't need much to keep me happy. I don't need a lot of romance. I don't need the book to \\"teach\\" me anything. If it provides quality entertainment, then I am happy and will give the book a high review. I mean, that's the point of reading for pleasure, right? To entertain yourself.<br /><br />To be honest, this book was very confusing at first and actually a bit annoying. The confusion factor lasted throughout the novel, but that's part of the idea - as I was reading I kept trying to figure out what the heck this maze thing was all about - were they in outer space? Was it a real place, or some sort of virtual reality thing? Was the maze really as big as they thought it was? Who were the boys? Why were they put in the maze? What the heck ARE the Grievers? and so on and so on. As the story progressed, it often seemed like the questions kept multiplying rather than answering themselves - I can see how some people would find that annoying, but I for one am ok if my gratification isn't exactly instant. Also, when the book ends, MOST OF OUR QUESTIONS STILL ARE NOT ANSWERED! I don't however think this is a bad thing because it will obviously give the series some cohesion.<br /><br />Now, the reason I did not give the book five stars was for one very simple reason - the author tends to repeat himself. I find this incredibly ironic, given the fact that there ARE so many unanswered questions and that one of the whole concepts of the book is to keep you confused and in suspense. But there were ideas that were mentioned early on that would get mentioned again in the next chapter, as if for the first time.  This was not a one-time occurance. After awhile I felt like my intelligence as a reader was being insulted. Granted, this got better after the first 1/3 of the book, and it's a relatively small complaint as it did not keep me from enjoying the book as a whole....however, because of this flaw the book only deserves four stars in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, Mr. Dashner is an incredibly talented writer, and this book definitely stands out from the crowd of YA literature on the shelves! I am DYING to start the second book, however, IT IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN MY TOWN!!!!! I've checked every single store that sells books, even including Target and Wal-Mart, and NONE OF THESE STORES CARRY IT!! Grrrrrr I MUST know what happens next! haha. I definitely recommend this book to pretty much everyone who enjoys a good, action-packed, edge-of-your-seat read :)ter the first 1/3 of the book, and it's a relatively small complaint as it did not keep me from enjoying the book as a whole....however, because of this flaw the book only deserves four stars in my opinion.

B004FRX0MY|2.0|The app Is great for downloading songs from the amazon cloud service, but that's about it. Ability to organize music is weak, and playing music always ends up locking my atrix - even over wifi.  I'd recommend downloading to your phone and using the google player.

1451629184|5.0|The layout of this book is very appealing. But, as would be expected, the subject matter is what really counts. It answered many of the questions I had regarding this unique situation, but raised just as many. In many ways Jaycee endured more than I thought, and in others less. In particular, her first six years were worse than I thought, while she had more freedom after her seventh year than I thought.    Ironically, I mostly agree with her musing at the end of 1998, where she states that, if she could turn back the clock, she wouldn't have changed a thing in her life. If anything had changed before she got pregnant with her second child she would not have had this very important person in her life, and I'm glad she realizes this. However, this musing occured about a year and a half after being rescued would have had no negative effect.    I wish Jaycee and her daughters the very best, and look forward to the potential of reading a future book by Jaycee not related to her unfortunate circumstances. It would also be great to read books written by her daughters telling the story from their perspectives.
B004XQO8VO|5.0|The 5 stars are for the movie. I love it.<br />I haven't aquired the blu-ray yet because I need to know 2 things first.<br />1) Is the the quality worth upgrading to blu-ray<br />2) Is this the Pizza Hut edit or the original Taco Bell edit. I can't stand the Pizza Hut edit because you can clearly see the lipsinc. It's really annoying.<br /><br />Anyone, please help!
B005J2UM9S|4.0|Well, to be honest, I was sort of skeptical of this movie.  The beginning was a bit corny and cheesy.  And the intro of Lance on Grave Encounters show reminded me of Paranormal State intro with Ryan talking.  And a lot of the mannerisms Lance has seem to be from Ryan Buell.      Anyway, once you got out of the corniness, the movie really took you into the haunted bowels of the abandoned mental asylum.  For the reminder of the time, the movie had me on edge to be honest right to the very end.  Not many movies can do that to me but this one did.  I highly recommend it for anyone fond of paranormal type movies without the gory, slasher details.  Enjoy guys!
1572814349|5.0|I bought these as a gift for my mother.  For those not familiar: Some are of the belief that a set of Tarot cards will only work if they are given as an unsolicited gift.  With that being said, I can't comment on how well they are for reading purposes or how well they follow the principles of Tarot, but the cards themselves are stunning and the gilded edges make the complete deck of cards look like you are holding a bar of gold.  The package also comes with a small book to instruct you as to each cards meaning and how to deal and read the cards.
0892818875|5.0|This is the first book I acquired about aromatherapy and I feel very lucky for having made an excellent choice.     This book is a perfect introduction to aromatherapy, it explains the basics using an easy to follow language.  I especially liked the way that the book is organized.  You can read it from start to end, or as a reference  and jump from one chapter to the other.     It also may be used as an elementary introduction to eastern traditional medicine, and has many references to acupuncture as well but all those bits and pieces help you understand more about the body/spirit and are not confusing at all.     Totally recommended for beginners!
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I never knew how much I actually loved Kings Of Leon, and then I got this CD, and I was like.... \\"Wow?!

B005MF1O5S|4.0|Another standalone episode for Series 6, \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" isn't so much character development for the cast as it is a character study for all three of the main cast: Amy, Rory and the Doctor, as they face the episode's themes of kindness and choice. The pacing was well done and there were nuggets of wittiness to help break up some of the heavier moments. The episode is filled with some awesome visuals and the Handbots were an interesting villain, with their \\"Kindness\\" actually being lethal.<br /><br />Fans of the Ponds will be happy to note that they really are the stars of this episode. Karen Gillan gives an excellent performance as both versions of Amy, the spunky, younger version and the older, embittered survivalist. Plus, you get to see her really kick ass. Arthur Darvill as Rory really tugs at the heartstrings when faced with his choice. The Doctor features far less than either Amy or Rory but Matt Smith, as always, gives a great performance.
B005COO1X6|5.0|For a longish short story, \\"Mile 81\\" manages to cram in some decent characterizations (even among the several victims who are only briefly seen) and many scares.  The scares, not so incidentally, are generated by a pretty well-crafted piece of imagination: essentially a monster from space who (at least currently) is shaped like a mud-spattered station wagon that's sitting alongside an abandoned rest stop like a Venus Fly Trap, just waiting for curiosity seekers to check it out.<br /><br />The story reminded me of those small gems that the author routinely included in his periodic telephone book-sized anthologies of decades past: an efficient little story that gets the job done quickly but not by cheaping out on the richness or drama or that all-important creepiness.  In this case, you'll never look at a moldy old station wagon again.<br /><br />A cool bonus (and possibly the main reason this \\"Kindle Single\\" exists in the first place) is also included with one's purchase: a meaty little promotional excerpt from \\"11/22/63\\", Mr. King's novel about the JFK assassination and the time traveler who tries to prevent it.  As rich and imaginative as Mr. King's short stories can be, it's his long, ambitious novels where those qualities will most often really shine.  And from this excerpt, \\"11/22/63\\" doesn't look to be an exception to the rule.<br /><br />So, if you're at all a fan of Stephen King, you can do worse than spend a couple of bucks and change for an early look at both a polished little short story (that will undoubtedly be a highlight of a future King anthology) and a late-career novel that just might be- judging by the subtle, intriguing, and nuanced excerpt seen here- right up there with \\"The Stand\\" in its creativity and memorability.  Heck, I'll be more than satisfied if \\"11/22/63\\" is as least as good as the decent, perfectly satisfying \\"Under the Dome\\" of a couple of years past.<br /><br />Anyway, \\"Mile 81\\" is fun, cheap, includes a meaty glimpse of a possibly great novel, and is only a click away on your Kindle.  What's stopping you?your Kindle.  What's stopping you?

B003ZSJ212|1.0|What is inexcusable is Lucas's refusal to give the original, untainted trilogy a full restoration and hi-definition release. The sanctity of Star Wars has long been forfeit. All that's asked is that the integrity of the originals be preserved amid the abortive atrocities that Star Wars has come to represent.
142311339X|5.0|This was a great book, and a great branch off of the Percy Jackson series. It stays consistent with the original series while adding new elements to the storyline.
0060531053|3.0|I know a lot of people enjoy reading this author's work, but I find it very very very irritating.     If you took this book and gave it to a copy editor and told her/him to edit out all the useless catch phrases and poor attempts at humor, the book would be half the length and much more informative.    As it is, there is so much wordiness that it's really difficult to use the book as a quick reference. That said, the content/info is quite good when not overdressed. He also does a great job of avoiding all the \\"extremist\\" lines of thought many home brewers develop. It's a worthwhile read for the beginner to get an introduction, but I've found just having my laptop open to a few home brewing forums to be far more helpful as a reference when I'm confused about something.    I debated giving this 4 stars, but the annoying writing forced me to round down on an otherwise 3.5 star review.
1400097029|5.0|This novel is a small masterpiece, but a masterpiece nevertheless.  Banville gives us here a profound meditation on aging and death, and seldom have I ever experienced such beautiful prose.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Movie - 5.0  Suffice it to say, X3 and Wolverine were pretty underwhelming. The dynamic relations in Xavier and Magneto's friendship and philosophy was pissed on and turned into some generic, shallow shell of its former self, and the potential depth in a character like Logan was wasted away by the whims of studio big heads. Thankfully, though, with Bryan Singer back on the X-train as producer and co-writer and Matthew Vaughn at the helm fresh off his Kick-Ass success, X-Men: First Class more than makes up for the disappointment. First Class is literally what it sounds like: an origins film. For those who aren't familiar with the X-Men franchise, there's actually very little you need to know, as the movie just essentially builds everything from scratch. If you're like me, and have been a fan for a while, whether it be through the comics, cartoon, or previous live-action films, then it should go without saying that you're in for a real treat. The one element that always attracted me to the franchise as a whole has always been the beliefs that Xavier and Magneto held and the conflict that existed between them. Both are ambitious and both have goals to someday create a world where mutants can live in peace. The only difference is that based on their upbringing, one believes in violence while the other does not. As mentioned about the dynamic between their relationship, I can't say how much I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Both play their roles in very convincing fashion and really manage to capture the spirit of the two, which is a refreshing sight to see and a definite positive step in the direction of the movie franchise. The storytelling is perfect in terms of character development and looks amazing on a production and technical level as well. In addition, the supporting cast does an equally good job. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique really helps to support the foundation of Xavier's beliefs, and Kevin Bacon does a surprisingly good job as Sebastian Shaw in ultimately shaping Magneto's beliefs (plus it's been a while since I've seen him in anything, so it's good to see him acting again). Before this film, I didn't think X2 could be surpassed in terms of scope. First Class has proven me wrong by a long shot. So far, this is the best movie of the franchise, and I'm hoping it leads to a few more.  Video - 4.5  - Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC  - Video resolution: 1080p  - Aspect ratio: 2.35:1  - Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1  So lately, I've started to become very interested in a lot of the technical work that goes in to movies, with a big part of it being the cinematography. When I discovered John Matheison, who had done the slew of Ridley Scott's epic period pieces (Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, and Robin Hood), I was very much excited to hear of his involvement as DP for First Class. I still find it ironic that First Class itself is something of a quasi-period piece taking place during the Cuban Missile Crisis and paying aesthetic homage to the earlier Sean Connery Bond films, but I think it actually works out very well. First Class was filmed on 35mm and has a very nice filmic texture giving it a dated, yet very clean look to the overall picture. Black levels are easily the best part of the video giving lots of great shadow delineation while providing excellent detail in clothing and facial features. Contrast isn't too high or low providing a good deal of discernment between people, objects, and the background, especially in some of the more darkly-lit scenes. The color palette starts off a tad muted at the beginning of the film when we see Erik in the concentration camp, but things tend to get much more vivid when he and Charles are grown up. This is most noticeable when we see Erik traveling around the world looking for Sebastian Shaw and get some brighter yellows, oranges, tans, and whites throughout the shots of the Swiss bank and Argentinian bar scenes. Detail is sharp for a good majority of the film aside from one very dark shot when Charles and Erik are in the truck sneaking around in Russia. There's also a shot when Charles is trying to train Alex in the bomb shelter where all the light fixtures cause a kind of blue ringing effect on the camera, but it's more so just a quirk with the lighting than any kind of transfer problem. Other than those possible minor quibbles, there's really nothing wrong with the picture quality as a whole. Overall, I love the filmic texture and the picture's ability to balance dark and flashy. Emma Frost looks very good in either her sparkly dresses or diamond body form, and the visual effects appear virtually seamless whenever there's action on screen.  Audio - 5.0  Languages  - English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1  - Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1  - French: Dolby Digital 5.1  Subtitles  - English, French, Spanish  Equally impressive is First Class' audio presentation. Designed and recorded by Ron Bartlett (some of whose work includes Sherlock Holmes, Terminator Salvation, and the final cut of Blade Runner), there's a lot to enjoy, here. To start, dialogue is clear and audible through the center, and for what Charles' power is worth, from the other four speakers. In fact, I think one of the cooler, more subtle effects of the film is his telepathy. It has something of a rippling resonance to it that gives it an even cleaner sound than just hearing him talk on camera. Granted, it's a sound effect added through post-production, but what did you expect from an X-Men movie? But moving along, I also really like Henry Jackman's score. Listening to it as a standalone CD, as a part of the movie, and then as an isolated track on the BD (in conjunction with his wonderfully spirited interview on the special features), I have to say I've really come to appreciate his compositional work and how it really creates the mood of the movie overall. And then of course there are the sound effects. Being a summer blockbuster, the film has its definite fair share of booms, bangs, zips, rumbles, etc. High and low ends handle extremely well, particularly in the form of energy charges whether it be Shaw absorbing bombs, discharging it to kill a bunch of people, Magneto moving metal, Alex shooting his beams, or Azazel's teleportation. Surround activity has an excellent balance of front and rear channel dispersion as well, some of it around the beginning and middle, but mostly at the end when the X-Men and Magneto are fighting the Hellfire Club. LFEs are my favorite part of the audio, though. The aforementioned moving of metal by Magneto is the best example of this. Much like the previous X-films, whenever he uses his powers the sound design has always made that creaking sound which, if you have a competent sub-woofer, should sound amazing. I also really like the first appearance of the Blackbird towards the end of the film for its rumbly jet turbines and engine, and of course the part where Magneto lifts the submarine out of the water and drops it on the island.  Extras - 4.0  - X Marks the Spot (HD; 19:55 altogether)  A feature that you can either play with the movie itself or as a standalone. It plays more like the half-assed version of Maximum Movie Mode where the film diverges into behind-the-scenes footage during the actual movie and not as a true Picture-in-Picture that goes along with the it, but it's still pretty informative. However, I don't think the overall duration of it is really worth watching in-movie, as it feels a tad intrusive. Had it been something of a true P-i-P like what Vaughn was able to do with Kick-Ass, then that would've been much, much more immersing. These are  the features broken down:  - Erin in Auschwitz (1:57)  - Charles Meets Raven (1:56)  - Mr. Howlett Declines (1:55)  - Mindscape (1:49)  - Emulsional Journey (4:13)  - Rebecca's Return (1:44)  - Cuban Beach Pre-Viz Sequence (3:07)  - Retro Cool (2:51)  - Children of the Atom (HD; 69:49 altogether)  It's a 7-part feature that essentially covers everything from pre- to post-production and everything in-between. Of particular interest to me was how articulate the crew was in trying to make this a kind of throwback movie to the days of James Bond, but with an X-Men twist, and a little more grit. There were also some very cool snips of how the makeup and visual effects were created and implemented, and I especially loved the interview they had with Henry Jackman. It's only a few minutes, but the guy speaks so candidly and with so much gusto that I was very entertained, yet felt very informed by the what he had to say about composing the music and the kind of ideas he got from talking with director Matthew Vaughn. Here's the breakdown:  - Second Genesis (10:01)  Talks about the initial concept of setting the movie in the '60s, how the idea came about in the first place, and why they decided to go for it. After the abomination that was X3, I wholeheartedly accept this sort reboot prequel.  - Band of Brothers (11:51)  Discusses why they chose to use certain characters and how each actor was chosen to play them. In thinking about it, I find it interesting that despite continuity issues this main cast of characters still worked out pretty well. While it's definitely more of an Xavier/Magneto-centric film, the characters still offer enough support to back the literary themes of the story very well.  - Transformation (10:06)  A pretty cool look at the make up and prosthetics work that went into Beast, Mystique, and Azazel. In particular, I really liked the bit on choosing the right design for Beast. They mention Vaughn wasn't all that keen with Kelsey Grammer's look in X3, and that they wanted to go for a more wild, animalistic style for this re-visioning.  - Suiting Up (8:33)  The costuming of the film, getting all that '60s clothes, and how they managed to put yellow back into the original costumes. It was very interesting to find out that the yellow itself was supposed to represent the natural color of Kevlar.  - New Frontier: A Dose of Style (9:55)  Goes into great detail about how Vaughn specifically wanted to refer back to classic James Bond movies (of the Sean Connery variety) for the production and art design of First Class. They talk about how is such a genre piece now that they wanted to infuse as much of that style and ambiance as possible by building a lot of the sets from scratch. And in hindsight of what was written when Vaughn saw Inception, I can see why he was upset that the \\"revolving set\\" idea was beaten to the punch. Ah well, the tumbling X-Jet sequence still looks pretty cool.  - Pulling off the Impossible (10:23)  Shows the awesome work of Visual Effects Guru John Dykstra. Here, they cover a lot of things like how the Banshee/Angel fight scene was actually filmed on helicopters and no green screen, the detail in Emma Frost's diamond form, and concept behind Sebastian Shaw's energy absorption/discharge.  - Sound and Fury (6:29)  A very entertaining interview with composer Henry Jackman. The highlight of this feature is how he went through all of the trouble to create Magneto's theme with a bunch of fancy notations and drawn-out tunes, when all Vaughn really wanted was \\"the f-ing bass line.\\" And guess what, it was a good idea.  - Isolated Score (Dolby Digital 5.1 @448kbps)  It would've been cooler to have it in lossless format, but it's still a great listen in hindsight of Jackman's interview and in the context of everything else the movie established both symbolically and thematically.  - Deleted Scenes (HD; 14:07)  Most are just alternate takes, but some of them are actually pretty funny, though they probably would not have worked as well if left in.  - Cerebro: Mutant Tracker  It basically takes clips from all the other movies and tacks on a little dossier at the end of each one. I could write better bios than this based on what I've seen and read in the cartoon series and what little I've read of the comics...  Personally, as informativeas the extras are, I was hoping for it to be closer to the level of Kick-Ass, where at least an audio commentary or a true P-i-P track to go along with all, if not most of the movie, would've been nice.  Overall - 4.5  I've always been a fan of the X-Men franchise. I read some of the comics, watched all of the cartoon, played the numerous video games, collected the action figures, even made a (short-lived) fan club for it in 5th grade, and have really enjoyed the live-action movies (the first two, anyway..). And just when I thought X2 could never be topped, I was proven wrong. Matthew Vaughn (whom I now really wish would've done X3) has really shown signs of great directing prowess. Screw the financial shortcomings and pay attention to just how great of an X-Men film this is and show your support for more incarnations to make their way into the franchise. Whether it be more prequel stuff or even present day continuations, Brett Ratner's piece of crap and the slightly better (but not by much) Wolverine have been redeemed. With some masterful characterizations, a fun atmosphere, and some amazing production values, the movie deserves high praise. And while the extras are still a good two hours in length, I still wish a better P-i-P or at least an audio commentary were available. But with reference A/V quality to enhance the already great story, this is still one of my favorite BDs for the year so far. It's a must-own for X-Men fans and even a definite recommendation for those who aren't familiar with the franchise.
0920236162|5.0|Brilliant book from my childhood that I had forgotten about so when I saw it on here I bought it straight away for my daughter.  the book is about a princess which has to rescue a prince from a fire-breathing dragon.  She outwits the dragon and proves you don't need to take any c**p from any guy!  Great, fun book for ages 4+
B0031OCY2E|3.0|This is a great story that needs to be told, but the directing and casting were lacking.  They really make Decatur out to be a little hicksville.  While in the middle of the cornbelt, it is only a few hours from Chicago.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|What can I say, it's Starwars. The new films do look nice in HD and the soundtrack is awesome as usual. I love the new effects as Han is defrosted from his Carbonite prison especially. But as usual with most of the times it's been released (LIke C3PO saying Do take good care of yourself to Artoo and the AND sounding really wrong) there's a problem with some of the audio. Please bear with me I'm not one to moan, I normally just sit back and accept things, but here goes.    *Rant mode engaged*    Having read all the reviews I am tempted to send Return of the Jedi back to Lucas with a note reading *Please remove Vader's NO! and send it back to me* The first one I mean, as it's as bad as if someone passed wind during a funeral. I can live with the second NO as it doesn't sound as badly dubbed.     I wouldn't mind but the guy who did it should be ashamed, it is totally off pitch. Which kiss A** people did Lucas get to sit through this? It certainly wasn't any of us fans. Seems that he is trying to alienate us older fans so he can hook in the younger audience, most of whome don't seem to mind the new additions. It seems all this was hidden and covered up from the fans, while Lucas stood on stage with his grinning face showing off the deleted scenes, like a magician keeping the audiences attention on him.    When all's said and done, I forsee Lucas will go down in history as the biggest scammer and con artist ever, because you can bet when he changes the Vader bit back due to fan outrage, he will make us pay for it again. Either that or he will ignore us while he sits on a pile of money that would make Scrooge McDuck happy.    That said I say we need a petition. Lucas should change the ending of Jedi and then we return the blu ray and get the new version without Vader shouting NO! Because I am scarily getting used to it!!!!! How could Lucasfilm make such a blatant sound error as this? They are the ones that gave us THX and changed the way films are today, yet they can addin a sound that sounds like a 1st year undergraduate added it, and then expect us to not moan when we want our money back?    Heck even Simon Pegg agrees with us!    There got that off my chest. I have bought the Blu Rays and will watch them. I just wish Lucasfilm would put two versions on the discs like most other film companies. One that is the special edition and one that is his vision (Directors Cut), instead of being such greedy pigs. I have heard people saying, it's Lucas' vision he can do what he wants. But would you buy a painting and then let the artist come in the house and paint I RULE on it? Just because he thinks it looks better.     Still all said and done I would say don't buy them but I know that's not going to happen, as Lucas has turned the films into a drug.    People under the age of 18 won't notice any changes however, as they might not have seen the originals. So they are more likely to buy them.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Awesome, just awesome. All editions and incredible quality. If you like Bladerunner you must buy this version! The sound and video are outstanding.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I had been looking for a knife I could use camping and hunting for a long time. I wanted a knife that would hold up to a lot of use and abuse, but did not cost an arm and a leg. I also wanted a knife I could use cooking, chopping everything or splitting fire wood. I reviewed a lot of Knifes before I choose the \\"Ka-bar Becker Campanion.\\" When I received this knife I was amazed. Out of the box, I could tell this knife was what I was expecting. You could tell the construction and design of the knife was made to hold up to heavy use. The blade is a full quarter of an inch thick from the tip of the blade to the end of the handle. The blade came out of the box super sharp. The handle is easy on the hand and designed to not slip. I would recommend putting \\"Lock Tight\\" on the handle screws to prevent them from coming loose in the field. I will recommend this knife to all who like to hunt or camp.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Amazon ruined this app with their restrictive DRM protection. Even though I paid for the app, it will not start unless you have a constant data connection to the Amazon servers. If you happen to find yourself inside a large building that doesn't have cell phone coverage, you are out of luck!    I went on google marketplace and got this same app. Works much better.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I love you, George Lucas.    I wish you had some friends in your life that did as well.    You deserve better than this.  You are a legend.  You made fricking STAR WARS!!!!  I went to the drive-in every weekend when I was a kid to watch this movie.  The day it came out on HBO, I watched it right up until my Mom made me go to school.  The best Christmas I ever had was when we went to the movies to see THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.    What happened?  What did I do to make you mad at me?    I was Star Wars when Star Wars was still considered geeky.  I suffered ridicule and shame because I was a sci-fi kid.  Now everyone loves sci-fi.  I thought I could finally put those painful years of shame behind me.  But now this.  I feel that shame and ridicule all over again.  But not from the kids who thought I was a geek.  I'm feeling that from you.  Please, give me back Star Wars.    I will pay double,   no triple,   the asking price of this box set for a cleaned up original version.    I promise.    Ewoks and all.    Just fix it.    I promise I'll never bring this up in an argument.    I won't hold these new versions against you.    We'll just never talk about it again.    Like it never happened.    Ok?
B001152TL6|4.0|\\"Lost Highway\\" (1997) is directed by David Lynch. The film is about a saxophonist named Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) who murders his wife (Patricia Arquette) for being unfaithful and then goes insane in prison. Most of the film seems to be about Fred's surreal recollections after he is imprisoned, which are filled with dread, erotic recollections and the despair of a banal distrustful life. 135 minutes seems just about right for this film as it finishes with a flurry of bizarre and haunting images. Lynch cut this film down by 25 minutes after its initial screening.<br /><br />The 2002/2003 full screen dvd is a horrible transfer so be careful to only buy the 2008 Universal Studios' Focus Features dvd version which is in the proper anamorphic widescreen format of 2.35:1 with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. There are no special features on either dvd version.
0446615625|1.0|I admit that I am only reviewing the first 110 pages of this book.  I was reading it and thought, \\"Boy, I hope this picks up soon\\".  Then I noticed the page number.  If I am that bored 110 pages into a book, it is not worth finishing.
B0058FW26C|1.0|We generally like the sci-fi action type movies, but this one just never really got going and seemed to be just too \\"out there\\" for our tastes.
B0000024T3|1.0|I ordered this for my wife because she had found a LP record at a garage sale and I no longer have the technology to play records. I was very interested in hearing the album because of all the great reviews I read on-line. What a disappointment! Barbra sounds shrill and the recording studio sounds like an echo chamber. I have never been a Barbra fan, but I was willing to give a listen to what was advertised as some of her best work. Clearly she is a virtuoso - few people can make their voices do what she does. The only question I have is why would anyone want to?
B004EPZ08O|5.0|There is a gym scene in this which tops all others including the one in Rocknroll High. The location shooting is spectacular and the interiors are very tastefully lit - when you are having an evening out at your favourite classy eatery and the chef comes and lights a flambe near your table, well this is that sort of film most of the way through. The accidents are well staged and bloody and sometimes unexpected and the acting and direction are good. This is the best entry so far in what has been a slightly disappointing series.
1933952806|5.0|In the first place, the manual is written by a well known, respected and credible Nikon photographer. Darrell Young obviously knows the problems with typical user manuals. He has written this as well organized, clear and consise mehod of learning everything you ever wanted to know...and a lot of what you never knew you needed to know treatise on the powerful and complex Nikon D-7000. This is the anti-product manual and should be the template for all future product manuals.<br /><br />Throw away the manual that came with the camera because this book far exceeds the official Nikon version. Here are just a few features that made this worthy of my 5-star review:<br />1) Written by a qualified photographer and reviewer<br />2) Well organized, indexed and tabbed for fast information retrieval<br />3) Excellent language and grammar skills.<br />4) Many, many color pictures of menu screens, user photographs and descriptors that make learning easy the first time through each chapter.<br /><br />The D-7000 is my first attempt at using a DSLR and his instructions were right on the money. He does background and theory before going into the specifics. And as a bonus, he even describes his setting preferences and rationale behind his choices.<br /><br />Finally, it's the kind of manual that will cause me to write to the author and thank him personally!
B000R8YC1S|5.0|I loved this film when I was a kid. Recently, I bought it because I thought my own children would like it. I was certain I would find it campy, being a grown-up now. We all know things we loved as children don't always end up being as great as we remembered. I was pleased to discover that \\"Labyrinth\\" is still a fantastic family film. It delivers what it was meant to--not the sweeping epic story that \\"Dark Crystal\\" was, but a musical tale with humor about a girl who learns a powerful lesson: Life isn't always fair and family matters most.<br /><br />The bonus features are worth getting the reasonably priced anniversary edition. Not only does this include the original \\"making of\\" documentary, but new insights into the film as well. Ben Froud and Jim Henson's son tell us more about \\"Labyrinth\\" and the characters. It was fun to discover that David Bowie's tight pants were deliberate. (Not that we honestly believed those were accidental, but I had a laugh when Ben Froud talked about the controversy and admitted it was 100% on purpose.)<br /><br />All in all, even 25 years later, this is one of the best family films out there (and one of David Bowie's best acting endeavors--if you're a fan of the rock icon). The only thing dated is the stepmother's hair and clothes. Other than that, it's easy to forget this movie was released in 1986. Two thumbs way up!
0451232577|4.0|CUTTING TO THE CHASE<br />The Fall of Giants is a novelized history of World War 1 / the rise of Communism in Russia, and to a lesser extent the rise of the &#34;labor&#34; movement in Britain.<br /><br />CRITIQUE<br />While Follett is clearly critical of the European class system, the tone is otherwise politically neutral, and dead-on accurate.  Indeed, Follett does a better job of presenting the pertinent history than many history textbooks.  Indeed, I suspect that (being victims of the American educational system) most potential readers will not have an adequate background to appreciate how masterfully Follett presents the history.<br /><br />However the characters and plot have the feel of a soap opera, with one-dimensional bad guys, and everyone else deeply &#34;flawed&#34;.  I found none of the characters interesting nor appealing.  And what's with all the irresponsible sex?  Some sort of analogy to the theme of radical liberalism?  As an egalitarian, I wish women were as strong as those presented in the novel, but considering the setting, the 1910s the portrayal of most of the female characters is unrealistic.<br /><br />As a historical novel with a &#34;cast of thousands&#34;, there are perhaps 2 dozen significant characters.  Readers who are not good with names are advised to take notes.<br /><br />COMPARISONS TO PILLARS OF CREATION AND WORLD WITHOUT END<br />To me, Fall of Giants has a different feel, and is NOT comparable to the two previous novels.  I enjoyed the two previous novels more, because the material was new to me, and I found the characters more compelling.  But then, I'm a geezer--for some young readers the 1910s may be as distant as the Middle Ages.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />Read Fall of Giants for the insigthts into the history of the early 20th Century--even if you already know the basic facts.<br /><br />&#62; Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.

B000OVLINI|5.0|Simply an amazing book. If you're a bibliophile, you'll love this book. A translation from a Spanish author, (which I am always leery of translations,) but simply marvelous. This is Dickens for the 21st century, although the story takes place in the 1930's through 1950's. Just lyrical, magical writing with outstanding characters you grow to care about. Mystery, murder, love story, etc. I would give it 6 stars if I could. A keeper book, one I will always have on the shelf. Note: you need to read this book at 50-100 pages per sitting in order to better keep up with the intertwining of characters and plot. Enjoy!
0807014273|4.0|could not read the first part where the man was in a concentration camp.  I lived thru the 40's hearing about them and did not want to revisit those memories.  Very deep, lots of words I don't understand. I will donate to the library.
B000FCK42M|4.0|This is the second Winslow novel I've read and I have several more sitting on my shelf. He is good and at the top of my favorite authors list. This involves the Mexican drug war with characters and settings from China to New York to Columbia to San Diego. Very gritty and still timely even six years after publication. A little long at 500+ pages but the pacing is excellent and the story never drags. Well done.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Without the unaltered versions I will not be buying this set. I have a copy of the THX VHS release and this is just going to have to hold me over until they release a proper version of the original three. Star Wars came on tv the other day but it was the 'special edition' and I just couldn't watch it. All the extra crap running around just ruins it.
B004GNFSO0|2.0|First published in Britain in 1956, it chronicles how Slavomir Rawicz, a 25-year-old Polish cavalry officer, broke out of a Soviet labor camp in Siberia in the midst of World War II. With six companions, he trekked 4,000 miles across Asia, passing through Mongolia, war-torn China, and Tibet before reaching freedom in British India.     I've had this book on my \\"want\\" list for years due to it's rating and review in the National Geographic greatest \\"true\\" adventure stories. Never could find it used so finally just bought it new.     That said, I'm skeptical if this is in fact a true story or just fiction. I'm leaning towards the latter due to the account of men going 12 days in the Gobi desert without water and for the ridiculous account of seeing 7 foot tall yeti in the Himalayas. Hell, they apparently walked 1,000 miles with no more than a loaf of bread between 6 men. C'mon! But, it was entertaining, especially accounts of life and hardships in the gulag. Based on fact checkers, he evidently was a Russian POW but was released in 1942. Did he make this 4,000 mile trek? Nah, not in my opinion. There are a lot more credible survival stories out there. \\"Endurance\\" is still the best of all time.
B002RKRV4Y|2.0|A great piece of literature that I have read before. I had to give this Kindle edition a low rating simply because the editing was shamefully poor. Find another edition preferably from someone who cares about the product they tie their name to.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I started watching the series on HBO and just enjoyed the hell out of it. I've read quite a few books but had never read a so-called \\"fantasy\\" book before now. I actually finished the HBO series before reading this book. Turns out the series followed the book, dialogue and all, almost word by word. Excepting that the book was much better as it filled out the story line and characters more. Well duh.<br />I like the way Martin has each chapter alternately cover one of the main characters. I'm already about 250 pages into the next book and HBO has renewed the series for next year. I plan to be caught up with all 5 books by then, even if each one is 800- 1,000 pages. Yikes. These books are page turners. Books that you find yourself looking forward to sitting down with. That is what makes me love reading. Only down side to the story line is the freaking amount of characters thrown in. But the main protagonists are easy to follow. And the \\"Imp\\" is one of the best characters in literature and television. Check him out.<br />Be warned, Martin will surprise you. You'll be coasting along and all of a sudden your jaw will drop when one of the supposedly main characters is done away with, so to speak. Good stuff.
0887307280|4.0|It's a great book in the sense that I had overlooked the simple concept of I was stuck in one way of thinking. Instead of trying to view all things as a Entrepreneur, Manager and Technican, I was stuck on the management side of things. In that sense it has really given me a new outlook on how to think about managing a business.<br /><br />But, as quite a few people have said, it read too much like a romance novel. For a business book, there shouldn't be all these colorful details (IMHO) about \\"The sun shone harshly through the spotless windows, sweeping the gleaming oak floor in front of the counter. I could see the dust in the stream of light, hanging suspended as though waiting for Sarah to speak.\\"<br /><br />The one book I've read so far that could go into detail about surroundings, use fictional circumstances and do it right has to be \\"What I Didn't Learn in Business School: How Strategy Works in the Real World.\\" Personally I would of preferred more citations (as they are lacking and feel like a work of fiction) and the whole \\"Start up a Turn Key Business\\" idea puts me off as well.<br /><br />The other book I read that puts so much emphasis on doing what McDonalds did was \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" and that's a put off for me personally as they both read in the very same way.<br /><br />But like I said, take the story with a grain of salt and the book is very informative.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Great CD, like all of Madonna's music You can't help but dance to every song. She is certainly one of a kind.
B0034G4ORM|1.0|I really don't understand the 5 stars.  One of the worst movie of the year.  No emotion at all. You care less for the characters.  The music didn't help at all. Very bad score and so heavy.  Why? because the army?, the GI's?, the Marines?, the War?  Sorry but other composers treated army subject with more class.  This \\"movie\\" is very noisy for nothing. Some special effects but that's it.  It really looks like a bad VideoGame.  The script is so stupid. Ex: You don't make noise when you're surrounded by Aliens.  GI's yelling all the time \\"GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO\\". It's 90% of the entire dialog.   There are so many incoherence.  If you don't believe me, rent it first before buying it.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Lucas hasn't produced anything good since the early 80s.  This long awaited release is just another failure as no theatrical versions are available.  Lucas spends a lot of time and money making the original trilogy as awful as the prequels and he almost succeeded.  R.I.P. Star Wars.

B000002LBH|4.0|Although this album is a collection of mostly B-sides and some singles, it was the one Smiths album I constantly listened to when growing up in the 80/90s.  Whether in a good mood or feeling blue, this album gives me solace.  The Smiths have a great catalog of albums, and each one stands on its own, but I keep coming back to this one.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Although the reviews of this book are consistently great, I hesitated before downloading onto my IPAD. I know absolutely nothing about so-called 80's geek culture - I was a stay at home soccer Mom raising a non-Geek daughter.  I am somewhat computer literate - that means I am skilled at buying things on the computer and reading my e-mail.  So what does that mean - that means anyone, and I mean anyone, can lose themselves within the pages of this book. I see OASIS as a metaphor for reading, and whether that is the author's intention or not, the reader becomes as immersed in the pages of this book as the avatars do in the world of OASIS. Long before video games the discerning reader of well-written books became immersed in the written worlds ( not a misprint ) - my first such remembered experience being \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\". - and   \\"Ready Player One\\" offers all of us the chance to escape for a few brief hours our reality in 2011.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I dont understand people's hate over things like this. I personally am looking forward to seeing this in stunning 1080 P. I think they may come out with another one later that may have originals so can people stop bagging on it before its released. Rate it on the movie not original versus new. I wasn't around when the originals were released so Im fine with the ones I grew up with. There are kids who grew up with edited ones believe it or not, and they are just fine. However I have also seen the originals in vhs and they are both great. So whatever the \\"fanboys\\" say I have already saved allowance and pre-ordered. However this is merely my opinion and Im only 13.[[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]]]
B005COO1X6|2.0|I purchased this short story (unfair to call it a novella) based on the glowing reviews.  I must say this is possibly the least satisying Stephen King story, short or otherwise, I have read. As I read the story I got the sense that it was written in one flurry of inspiration and then suffered no editorial review.  The story had no texture and the characters were not particularly believable.      It may sound harsh to say that this story could have been by a high school student.  To be completely frank, the  tale seems an ode to King's early days of writing, hastily written and with references to pop culture in a vain attempt to appear relevant.    The supernatural element, in this case a carnivorous car, was more believable than the story constructed around it.      Would a person who has just seen the flesh pulled from an arm by a meat-eating car really think, for even a moment, of how similar it was to eating KFC?  Would an elementary to middle school aged child drink a half-empty bottle of vodka he found in the forest?    What I found most enraging awaited after the abrupt and ridiculous resolution.  At around the 80% mark on the Kindle we are treated to a preview of Stephen King's latest full-length novel about a man sent back in time to kill Lee Harvey Oswald.  Everything Mile 81 lacked could be found in the first few pages of this novel.  The description of this suburban nightmare of a neighborhood was engrossing and richly detailed.      For King and short story fans I would suggest an investment in another work.  Don't be fooled by the cheap price.  In this instance you get what you pay for.
B004XQO90E|4.0|This movie was excellent from start to finish. I thought this would be a movie that the trailer shows you all of the best parts of the movie but it wasn't. I would give it an A-.    Madness
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I had to buy it. It was the only Sherlock Holmes movie I didn't own. It is my first Blu-ray purchase. I am delighted. Thanks to Amazon Prime, shipping was already paid for and I got it really fast.
B002TR4JFY|2.0|This book had wonderful potential and a great story line.  However, it certainly could have done without all the sexual details (Ken Follett seems to be obsessed with sex). I never finished it.
1612680011|5.0|This book changed the way I think about money. It has changed my life. This book is a great tool to educate the importance of money to someone who has no sense of budgeting, spending, saving, investing or living within their means. It helped me appreciate my hard earned money after I read it. Robert Kiyosaki is brilliant.
B004LWZVZC|3.0|There are so many good things to say about this film: the technical aspects--cinematography, production design, costuming--were outstanding. It was obviously carefully researched factually and it was well-acted. Director Redford is to be commended for this effort, and yet...the end result is relatively dry and unemotional. It is much like reading a well-written history book.  It's worth a watch, but maybe not a purchase.
B0059DOJGY|4.0|...and that's a very good thing.    Edguy's previous album, \\"Tinnitus Sanctus\\" (2008), was so uninspired and uninteresting that comparing almost anything to it seems like an easy task, however, \\"Age of the Joker\\" ditches the mediocrity of its predecessor almost entirely and sounds like a mix of Edguy's fantastic \\"Rocket Ride\\" (2006) and Avantasia's \\"Wicked Symphony\\" (2010).    It is not a perfect album by any means, in fact, you might not like it too much on the first play-through - so be prepared. However, if you are willing to give it a chance, after a couple more spins, you will really, really dig it. I'll try to convey my impression of it without being too subjective, so that you can find this review useful.    First, the good.   --> Tobias's voice sounds incredible! He went through a couple of rough patches during the \\"Scarecrow\\"/\\"Tinnitus Sanctus\\" period, but returned to form in 2010 for \\"Wicked Symphony\\" and sounds even better now on this album. The powerful vibratos are back!  --> Classic sound is back in a lot of songs! \\"Nobody's Hero\\" and \\"Two out of Seven\\" sound like they were supposed to be on \\"Rocket Ride\\". \\"Breathe\\" could have easily been on \\"Hellfire Club\\". The boys of Edguy even go as far back as the sound of \\"Mandrake\\" with such songs as \\"Rock of Cashel\\" and \\"The Arcane Guild\\" (\\"Fallen Angels\\", anyone?). A lot of other tracks sound like the strongest stuff from Tobias' latest Avantasia release.  --> The anthemic epic vocal harmonies are back!  --> No songs feel like \\"fillers\\" here. Even \\"Rocket Ride\\" had a couple of those, but \\"Age of the Joker\\" is completely listenable from its beginning to the end.    Now, the not-so-good.  --> From a musical perspective, the constant key changes within songs are not always very easy to get used to. For example, if the verse of the song is written in A minor, the chorus in E-flat minor sometimes sounds a little off. (this is subjective and may not be an issue to others)  --> Guitar solos on a few tracks could havebeen and should have been longer. Nothing more to add to that. (this is also subjective)  --> A couple of tracks seem like they were rushed or the band didn't know where to take them and what to do with them. \\"Two out of Seven\\" could have been one of the most amazing songs in the whole Edguy's catalog, but instead, they cut the guitar solo WAY too short and just fade the song out before you can really get into it. Not sure what happened there. \\"Robin Hood\\" tries WAY too hard to be epic, and never really goes anywhere. Lastly, \\"Pandora's Box\\" sounds really awkward with the whole western/blues/country/whatever guitar riff (again, this may be subjective, and, thankfully, the awesome epic chorus makes up for it).    Overall, simply put, if you liked \\"Rocket Ride\\" and said \\"WTF?\\" when you heard \\"Tinnitus Sanctus\\", you will really dig this record.
076115678X|3.0|I had better hair with sulfates. While the method in this book may be good for some it didn't work for me. I don't have the money to buy and keep trying different expensive shampoos. The kicker is while you can use just conditioner just to wash your hair or even a natural shampoo (because she just said sulfate free and they make these in shampoos), you still have to make sure that you get something without silicones in it. I don't have time to go around trying to find shampoo and conditioner without silicones and sulfates. I imagine maybe the method would work if I got rid of silicones but otherwise I have to wash with sulfates after 2 washes with sulfate free or else my hair gets strawlike and weighed down because it's so fine. So I guess I am a modified curly girl. I think all the buildup of silicones was causing hair loss. Started with sulphates again every 3rd shampoo and my curls are pretty good.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|This movie was a favorite of my cousin and I when we were young. I was excited to find it on DVD and bought it as a gift. The movie quality is great but my only complaint would be the DVD cover - it looks grainy and poorly reproduced.
0425242099|5.0|Hawke, the Alpha of the SnowDancer Pack and Sienna Lauren, a Psy have been butting heads from the moment her family defected from the PsyNet. Three years later, Sienna has matured and thanks to the SnowDancer pack, she's learned to leave the cold of the PsyNet behind her and embrace her emotions, especially  when it comes to the wolves dynamic Alpha. Sienna knows that she's woman enough  to be a match for Hawke, however Hawke knows that the wolf who was destined to  be his mate died as a child and wolves only mate once in a lifetime. Hawke believes it's in Sienna's best interests if he keeps away from her, despite the desire  she stirs inside the wolf and the man. The more he tries to keep away the more  destructive he becomes for denying his instincts. With the SnowDancers on the  brink of war with the Psy a unhinged Alpha is the last thing his pack needs.<br /><br />He and Sienna began a destructive game that could not only destroy themselves,  but the entire wolf pack.<br /><br />I've been looking forward to reading Hawke's story since I first began Ms. Singh's  Psy-Changeling series last year. Hawke and Sienna have been building up as a  couple from the first book and KISS OF SNOW has been my most anticipated read this year. My anticipation has built as word trickled in several months prior  to Kiss of Snow's release that Hawke and Sienna's story was the best in the series to date.<br /><br />Since receiving KISS OF SNOW, I've read it from cover to cover twice and the ending at least four additional times. It gets better with each retelling. I admit I was little confused and disappointed with the ending at first. While Ms. Singh does an awesome job at putting her characters in the worst possible situations for their psyche's and then having them have to figure out how to get out of it, I  have to admit, I've seen this type of ending from her before and while it captured me the first couple times, I wished for something different (to be more explicit,  how the Psy can connect with each other outside of the contriction of the Net works and how that construct expands). However, the more I read the ending the more I liked it. It felt like pieces of a chessboard coming together and that everything was going to tie in later on down the road in the series.<br /><br />Hawke and Sienna were great characters. Hawke was as drool worthy as always and I was glad that Sienna was his match despite her age. Hawke needed put in his place several times and I was glad that Sienna was woman enough to do so. Their relationship throughout KISS OF SNOW was one step forward two steps back, but it was done in such a compelling way with interesting plot twists and turns that I had to keep reading to see how it was going to turn out.<br /><br />The side plot of Walker Lauren's romance was so multi layered that I believed it deserved a book of its own. Despite how complete Walker's romance was, it didn't distract from Sienna and Hawke's romance.<br /><br />When I read books, I focus more on the characters and their reactions to each other rather than the actual plots, but can I humbly say that with the exception of the one thing that bugged me with the ending, I was constantly surprised with the twists and turns, the real conflict preventing the hero and heroine from achieving their happily ever after (Sienna's unique destructive power, even for  a Psy, Hawke's inability to mate, and the war coming to destroy the pack) was  the best that I've read this year. What I love about Ms. Singh's Psy-Changling series is how rich the plot is but not at the expense of character development.<br /><br />Fair Warning: KISS OF SNOW is not a stand-alone book, and would make readers confused if they hadn't read the previous books in the Psy-Changeling series. However, I highly recommend getting the earlier books in the series and reading them. They're great reads<br /><br />Review courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiquesother outside of the contriction of the Net works and how that construct expands).

B004ZGI2KK|4.0|A very interesting movie. Not what you would expect from a movie titled \\"Red Riding Hood\\" (considering the classic tale), but a very interesting twist. This is definitely not a child's film!

B001E45XT4|5.0|This headset has worked really well for me.  The microphone works very well with little distortion and the audio quality is better than any other headset I've owned.  It fits well on my head and the padding makes it very comfortable to wear over long gaming sessions.  The only small problem I've had is sometimes the padding can make it a little too warm on the ear causing me to sweat.
0071762345|4.0|This book basically lays out everything you wanted to know about social media but were too afraid to ask (Although thankfully not enough of a social media \\"guru\\" to falsely claim you knew already.) The stories given as case studies also provide great looks into what companies should do, and how to work being human into a social media plan.    Basic instructions are covered here as well, such as responding to negative (and good) comments, providing useful content to your fans, and ideas on using ads for maximum effect.    Lastly, the book also includes activity questions and actions at the end of each section to help you learn your brand or company, as well as its customers. This helps you figure out how to put the book's techniques into practice, and can potentially make it a textbook for a social media class.
0312330537|5.0|I read this while traveling in India and loved it.  It's a sort of true story about an Australian fugitive who flees to India and ends up living in the slums of Mumbai.  Everyone I know who has read it has loved it.  I don't usually buy books, I tend to borrow them from the library, but after reading it, decided that this is one I wanted to own.  Highly recommended.
B005J2UM9S|1.0|*****may contain slight Spoilers*****I'm generally not a tough critic and I can take a movie for what it is supposed to be.  I thought the beginning of this started off great.  I enjoyed how they mocked all those paranormal \\"reality\\" shows.  It started off pretty creepy and it was the subtle things that were really intense, but then the movie just got stupid, rather than having interaction with creepy paranormal spirits it turned into your run of the mill low budged horror film. A builidng that mysteriously changed form and rearranged itself, night time lasting for several days....c'mon.....they took a good idea and a great begining and just crapped on the rest. By the end absolutely none of it was scary or creepy.

0061714402|1.0|Dave Mustaine WAS without a doubt my favorite person in Metal. I love his voice, his chops, his first 4-5 albums. But this book just makes him look like a petulant doofus. It's a bummer. I know he had a history as drunk and junkie and for going through band members like bubble gum. But in this book he just comes off as a whiny, self-centered, blame everybody else, hack. He went pop and sucked. He came back sort of, but so what. He's a one dimensional dink and a hypocrite. This is sad to say but his music just sounds cloacal to me now. That said, this is an easy read. and if you skip anything you'll find the same crap in the Lemmy/Motley/Ratt/Winger/Andrew Dice Clay/Tim Allen/Paul Reiser bio. The book even admits to being cookie cutter on the dust jacket. The best part is the additional epilogue where Dave gets to pat himself on the back for writing such a no-holds barred, truth telling book. \\"Man, I'm great!\\" --- Making Metallica look less turdly by the page. Pffft.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|This book wasn't nearly as good as the first ones. I was anxiously awaiting it's release and am so disappointed. Nothing is resolved in fact there's just more characters wandering around and getting nothing done. Ugh. Wake me up when it's over.
B003Y5H542|5.0|Rango is definitely a must see for both kids and adults. Like all animated films, it has certain characteristics that appeal to the younger generation, but this is one of the few animated films I've seen that really catch an older audience too. Johnny Depp is a good pirate, but I think he should stick to his reptile form from now on. The characters are unique and the plot keeps you involved with lots of laughs along the way. This is by far one of the best animated films I have seem all year. If you are in need of a good laugh and want to share it with someone younger than you too, this is the perfect movie for that.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|It's no wonder that I'm not going to order this. Now I've grown up with Star Wars. I had all the toys growing up and was one of the biggest fans ever and now it's been what...33 years since the first film and having to go along for the ride of vhs, dvd and finally blu-ray, I thought this would finally be the last version any of us fans would ever need. Nope. Old George just can't keep his hands out of the artsy-fartsy cookie jar and continues to keep messing with something that he should've left alone in the first place.<br /><br />NOPE! No more. I've had it up to here with this and until George comes to his senses and figures out that this is not what the fans want and decides to put out the one and only original version that I first saw in theaters, he will not get one more penny from me. I hate to say it George, but you and you alone have sullen my appetite for SW.
B000002G1Y|5.0|The first time I heard John Hiatt was amidst the talking in a cafe in 1992.  The unique gravelly voice and bluesy sound caught my ear and soul...I don't even remember the song that was being played.  Rather it was the voice and melody.  The staff had to dig into their CD player to find out \\"who was playing?\\" for me.  I bought this CD and played it to death and still do.  Even today I love every song especially the haunting Blue Telescope.  John Hiatt's ability to create impacting images and feelings from words and music is equal to my other favorite, Neil Young.  Both are true poets creating emotions that truly move you.  Best of all they both rock and croon!
B000002J03|5.0|Maybe I have gone a bit over board with the title of my review, but that is how I feel about this album.  It is for me song for song one of the greatest rock albums in history.  Of course, all songs are not made equal and for those who like driving Rock and Roll there is \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" as my obvious choices.  But every song on this album works together as well as being individual.  I remember listening to this in high school during swimming.  The gym teacher used to put it on.  This album is so familiar and yet not one has worn out it's welcome.  I can almost understand why the gym teacher did put it on.  It was music us kids of the late 1970's could relate to and it was a classic already even being less than ten years old.  Not one dud on this album and each song flows into each other. The only song that seems slighty out of place is \\"Moby Dick,\\" but that is because it is an instrumental featuring Bonham's drum work.<br /><br />The only Led Zeppelin album that might be greater is Led Zeppelin 4 which is the best selling Led Zeppelin album of all time.  But Led Zeppelin II holds a special place for me as far as hard rock goes.  You see I collect mostly classical music these days.<br /><br />One of the things I like to say is the Bach is to the Beatles the way Shostakovich is to Led Zeppelin.  So if you know the Beatles and Led Zeppelin you get an idea what I think of Bach and Shostakovich.  If you only know Shostakovich and Bach you get an idea what I think of Led Zeppelin and the Beatles.<br /><br />If Led Zeppelin II were a Shostakovich symphony it would be his famous 5th.  Oops now I can't use that analogy for Led Zeppelin 4!<br /><br />I hope my review doesn't confuse you.  If you are thinking about buying this CD, then my advice is to get it!  It is one of the greatest CDs in Rock History.
B000002L3P|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this.  This has to be one of the all time greatest blues CD'S.  Especially fond of \\"Deja Voodoo\\".  Keep'em coming Kenny Wayne! Keep 'em coming!
B001W79MB8|5.0|What can I say the only reason I gave this one a shot was because it got 5 out of 5 stars on Amazon.com. However, I notice now that it's down to 4.5 stars. Guess there are some people out there who can't be pleased. Where do I begin? This movie was gorgeous in scope and in style. The sun and moon lighted landscapes were awe-inspiring. The plot while familiar in some ways doesn't fail to intrigue. Finally the thing that really won me over was the music. Such an important part in most films this one nailed the bullseye.     The story opens with a young boy and his loyal dog being sent away from a burning temple to escape an sinister conspiracy. His trusted master assures him that he will be given sanctuary in another location. However, not all is as it seems. The boy and his dog travel and seek shelter in an abandoned hut where they rest. As luck would have it an wandering vagrant discovers the boy and asks if he to can bunk in the hut. The boy extremely reluctant to allow a stranger into his personal space rejects the man's plea. The vagabond's good nature is obvious from the begining ,but the boy doesn't budge.     This is where the story hits a great twist. I won't reveal anymore, but I will say that this movie should be seen by all who have a love for action and wandering no name type movies. Heck it should be seen by everyone who wants an excellent movie experience. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen as things unfolded and the climax was extremely satisfying. I don't feel an urge to clap at any movie, but this movie took care of that. Five stars all the way!

B0006GAO5Y|3.0|Hadn't seen 'Rocky' in twenty years or more until just recently.  I was reminded that it's a somewhat peculiar mix of saccharine, entertainment, cliche and inspiration.  More interesting than much of the movie is the story of how Stallone got it made and how it vaulted him to superstardom.  Would give ol Rock three and a half stars if I could.
1400052181|5.0|I put off reading this book for a while. I have to read it for a college class. The minute I read the back cover of the book, I was intrigued. The writing INSIDE the book was even better! I can't put this book down once I start reading. It's addicting. Such an amazing story. I think everyone should read this book. Seriously. The author is so detailed. You feel like you can see everything playing out in your head. The scientific stuff is explained so that it's easy to understand. READ THIS BOOK!!!
B002BU0DPE|3.0|These Ear Force PX21 Gaming Headset for Playstation 3 work good for a month. After that the right ear stopped working and I had to ask for a new pair from Amazon. Which they sent no problem.<br />I love these headsets. After they are broken in the are comfortable around the ears and the sound is incredible.<br />I also found out that they work as a mic for Rock Band or Guitar Hero, which is a plus. But they like to burn out, especially the ears.
1439152799|3.0|I won't restate what so many reviews have already said, and said very well. The problem that I found with the book was that Kate Morton took so long to make the characters personal.  Too much time was spent just describing the characters and their actions, and in such an impersonal way that I was bored with the characters (especially the Blythe sisters) for the first half of the book.  Just describing a character's actions doesn't help the reader to care about the characters.  Once the sisters began interacting with each other, with dialogue, it was much more natural to care about them and they became more real.
B004UC1WN8|4.0|Jennifer Lopez hasn't really had a big hit single for almost 10 years.  Then \\"On the Floor\\" came along, a certifiable dance/club hit.  Unfortunately, the rest of the songs on the LOVE? CD aren't as memorable or catchy.  I was hoping for a CD filled with club-hopping hits, similar to \\"On the Floor.\\"  \\"Villain\\" and \\"Hypnotico\\" have potential, but they really deserve a remixed version of what's on the CD.  So while I LOVE \\"On the Floor,\\" I only merely LIKE the rest of the songs available on the CD.  5 stars for \\"On the Floor;\\" 3 stars for the rest of the collection.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I have both version's of the Passion of the Christ. But the Definitive Edition is better because it take out a few scenes. One part that isn't in this edition is right before the flogging scene starts, the 2 guards that bark in each other's face isn't in this film. This movie is highly emotional because it's the truth about what really happened. If you're looking for answers in life then please watch this film and then turn your whole heart,life, and soul to JESUS CHRIST THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE (John 14:6). God bless to all who watch this film.
1400052181|5.0|This is an amazing book. I am a cell culture scientist and found this to be a very enlightening story on some of the history of cell culture. Combined with the personal story of Henrietta and the family it made for an excellent read. The style of writing made you almost feel like it was a novel.  Highly recommend this for everyone even remotely interested in medicine and science.

B001F2LYEI|5.0|I came to this album later than most. I was always more of a fan of the first album, Hatful of Hollow and Meat is Murder. I always kinda assumed that the Smiths had lost the plot after Meat is Murder. How wrong I was. Fast forward several years and I found a used vinyl copy of The Queen is Dead while browsing the bins. I thought, what the heck, I'll give it a try, I loved the Smiths back in the day. I got it home and holy cow, I couldn't fathom why I had missed it back in the day. Such clever and biting Pop music, with gorgeous melodies and stunning guitar work! My love for the Smiths was rekindled. A few months later I found Strangeways Here We Come in the vinyl bins too. I took a chance on that as well and was also not disappointed. I did end up getting the CD of The Queen is Dead eventually, but it is no match for the rich warm tones of the vinyl record. Trust me, if you like this album and have a turntable, you need to pick this up. The original US Sire vinyl is sweet!

B003E6K1VK|4.0|I've been listened to different kinds of music over a week now and found it drove my AKG 701 very well. The built-in sound card performed significantly better than the JBL in my laptop. The battery last roughly 4 days (with 1 bar left), which I listened and left it on most of the time. I don't know about audiophiles, but I have no complaints about this little gadget.

B000GTCZWQ|5.0|The Whale Rider was a wonderful movie that was revolved around a young girl named Kahu.  She was the rightful successor to her grandfather's tribe, although a female had never before been a leader there.  Her grandfather does not feel she should succeed him, so he goes on a search to find a young male for the group's new leader.  She wants to leave but finds the whales calling her back.  Kahu learns how to use the fighting stick and wins a battle with the young man he finds.  After the whales are beached and Kahu gets them to go back into the ocean he realizes that she is the rightful successor to his tribe.    This movie relates to my religion class in many ways.  This tribe has their own beliefs and is a type of primal indigenous religion.  Her grandfather is a type of \\"shaman\\" as he is the leader of their tribe.  They have their own form of ceremonies and Kahu is actually told to leave one of them by her grandfather.  It also relates to indigenous religions by having harmony with nature and animals.  They know if the whales do not \\"un\\"beach themselves they will not survive.  They use their geography and nature around them to survive.

B0058EJJSM|4.0|Paul's best live album back when he was still rocking. Unlike any of the live albums that followed, Paul and the band sound fresh and spontaneous and less like a tribute band playing old songs. The best lineup of musicians that he has ever played with makes this the live McCartney album to get.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Simply amazing and jaw-dropping, awesome snowboarding and amazing cinemtography. After watching this film and even the previous Travis Rice film. You will no longer have the desire to just watch any old snowboarding film. This film just simply blows other snowboarding films out of the water. Granted it's sponsored by RedBull who we all know has money to burn. But even so it's a must see and must have in your collection of Snowboarding Films.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|I had never seen a preview for this movie, so I was very surprised by \\"Paul\\" the alien when he first appeared.  It is definitely adult humor though.  I'm a fan of X-Files and UFO anything, so this was a very fun time for me.  I've watched it several times and each time I catch more of the humor.  The unrated version is quite different from the version I saw in the theatre.  It had alot more homosexual references, which made it go down a notch for me.  But other than that it was a very funny movie.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Seeing that the 5th book has not answerd a lot of questions, and after reading the 1st-4th books. The reviews have made me want to wait for the following books., I agree the 4th book really gpt bogged down, and if the 5th is worse, then I'd rather wait.
1612680003|5.0|This Book has been written in a very simple and easy to understand style that a reader at just about any level can pick up and understand. It has put a lot of things that we see and do in our everyday lives into perspective. It opened my eyes as to how much we hold ourselves back from achieving more financially in life. In many ways we are our own worst enemy due to the way we think and the way we make society determine what we should and should not do. I consider my self to be well educated with a post grad degree in Finance and this book has made an impact on my life. It has given me a much needed wakeup call to help re-prioritize what is important and get me back on a more sustainable path of financial success. If the readers incorporates just one or two of the many steps laid out in this book they should experience a positive out look on their financial well being. I definitely recommend this book to anyone that wants to do more for themselves and their family.

You want to clear it or dismiss it, well you can't, at least not easily.  Only option is to go to the app turn alert notifications off.<br /><br />Update Feb 2012<br />a couple of versions later, they addressed the notifications problem.  That and a great selection of widgets makes the rating go from 3 to 5 stars.

1451629184|5.0|I put off ordering this book for a while. First, I knew the writing would only be so-so. Second, I was concerned that I would finish it with such hate in my heart for the perpetrators that I'd tote the burden of disgust around for too long. I have an eleven-year-old daughter after all. Wishing a painful death to those who would harm her isn't outside the realm of possibility for otherwise peaceful me.    But in the end, curiosity got the better of me and I ordered it, and then read it in a rush. I was wrong on both counts.    Yes, the writing shows a lack of finesse (verb tense mismanagement and simplistic in style) but also shows a great deal of heart and potential. Even the structure of the book, jumbled though it was, reflected the instincts of a superior storyteller. I do so hope that Jaycee continues to pursue writing. (Go to college, JC. Get an MFA. Find a writing group and keep writing.)    But mostly, while I'm satisfied that the Garridos are in prison, the love JC displays for all living things is remarkable. I'm touched beyond words.

1439152799|4.0|In general, I think my favorites books tend to be from authors who only produce a single novel, maybe two.  I guess they are the type of single stories an author almost feels the need to get out.  The bad part is it means I don't get to anticipate another novel from a favorite author too much.  Kate Morton is an exception...I just love her haunting stories.  I consider them literary mysteries although the word gothic is bantered about more.      The Distant Hours is told in two time periods, the pretty modern-day journey of Edie to uncover the past and the WWII-era residents of Milderhurst Castle.  Edie learns her mother was evacuated from London to the castle as a girl during the war and discovers the castle was also the place where a favorite childhood read was penned.  The book explores the mystery of the book as well as the disappearance of a young man engaged to one of the sisters living in the castle.  It is heavily influenced by concepts of family...both those that are arguably too tight and those where mothers and daughters feel at a loss to understand one another.        It probably isn't my favorite Morton book (The Forgotten Garden would win), but I still fell into and it is still a solid 4 star read.  The characters have complex histories and emotions and their relationships are much more real than perfect.  It's a long book but I devoured it.  I often want to savor a good read and not let it end, but I really wanted to know the book's secrets.  I'll definitely re-read it eventually....I think it would be interesting to go back to the start while knowing the secrets.
B004OVDVBQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I could not put it down. A real page turner. It improves your understandings of certain issues (I won't go into detail as to not ruin the storyline). It will be hard to find another book (for me) which lives up to this one. It's a must read!
0061928356|4.0|I had this on my nightstand and moved it up in the pile when a friend mentioned it on FB as a great read (too odd that we'd both suddenly picked it up).        Throughout this novel, the chapters vary focus but all revolve around the individuals tied to one little girl.  In India, Kavita gives her newborn daughter to an orphanage to save her from the gender-based infanticide that took her firstborn.  The child is later adopted and moved to American by Somer, a California doctor married to an Indian man who came to the US for his own medical training and stayed after they fell in love.  We get to see not only the two mothers but also their spouses, a bit of their families, and the shared daughter.  When the girl, Asha, is in college she takes a Watson Fellowship and goes to India to live with family and work on a journalism piece, allowing the reader to see both her American and Indian families.      I appreciate that the author really avoids one-sided characters.  We even grow to understand and see the good in the husband who had directed the infanticide of Asha's older sister.  We also see a lot of the beauty in the Indian culture as well as the startling contrasts in modern-day India between the well-off and those living in horrid, fetid slums.  India itself is a charcter, a well-rounded one, and the book is about both culture and family.        I'm at 3.5 stars though.  I'll round up to 4.  While I loved the way it felt very real and showed that reality is rarely pure good and pure evil, I just felt like it missed something that prevents me from the full 4 stars (despite the rounding that the websites require).  The characters were all real and flawed but I never truly felt like I understood them.  I did appreciate the ending and the vivid sense of place and definitely enjoyed the journey but I never fell in love with the book.

It wasn't, you can actually hear the scratches in the record that they recorded it off of on the cd. Worst sound quality of any cd that i have ever heard. Actually tossed this cd in the garbage.

B000062XGB|5.0|Having seen the stage production as a kid and enjoying the Yul Brynner version movie, I was pleasantly surprised how good the re-make was. Slight deviations here and there but all added to the enjoyment of the movie. It is well worth adding to the video library.
0439023491|3.0|Good follow up to The Hunger Games.  Poor Katniss, thought she was free of the barbaric Hunger Games forever, but oh no, the Evil President Snow has other plans, namely the Quarter Quell, held every 25 years. This time the arena is very different, a puzzle unto itself, and with a whole new slew of dangerous situations waiting around every corner . . .or curve.  The mutt birds scenario was a stroke of horrible genius. We have learned that Katniss can endure a great deal (to put it mildly) but what is the one thing worse than suffering yourself? Having to see (or in this case HEAR) loved ones suffering. Of all the torture devices the Gamemakers have served up, this one, where no contestant was actually in danger of losing life or limb, was actually the most horrific to imagine, for me.<br /><br />Although Catching Fire is obviously the second book in a trilogy I did expect it to have somewhat more of a completion of one installment feeling at the end. Or some sense of finality of one phase in Katniss life before moving on (as did book one) but there is definitely no completion or satisfaction of any kind by the end of this book. On the contrary the story ends with a cliff hanger and many, many unanswered questions.  At this stage, having just read the book, I am intrigued to find out what has happened to everyone back in District 12 (indeed, what has happened to the District itself) and were Gale, Prim and her mother tortured? The very sweet and innocent but oh so complex \\"love triangle\\" is really capturing my attention. WHAT is going to happen there! I find this aspect of the story quite compelling. I can't really decide myself who Katniss should be with.  She was forced to \\"love\\" Peeta by circumstances beyond her control, but he is such a great guy and adores her so much, and she does have certain feelings for him. Is the relationship nature or nurture and does one even have more validity than the other?  I want her to truly love Peeta, but then, what about poor Gale back home (if there is a home) he is no less deserving of Katniss, is he?  Does Katniss even have a future at all, with or without either Gale or Peeta? Yes, this book will leave you with a lot of questions. Thank goodness there is a third book! Here is to hoping my questions are answered in a fulfilling way! Off to the book store to find out.e back home (if there is a home) he is no less deserving of Katniss, is he?

1401216676|5.0|The art is outstanding, the storytelling superb, and the character examinations are vital to understanding both combatants. The \\"one bad day\\" premise highlights the \\"two sides of the same coin\\" argument that Batman and Joker are in fact more alike than dissimilar.
B00111YM5G|4.0|I wasn't expecting too much when I ordered this movie. Low budget flicks usually aren't very good but since this is a religious based film and since I'm a Christian who loves these types of movies, I thought, \\"Why not?\\"  I was not expecting such an awesome plot and even better sub-plot. I wasn't expecting such great special effects, or such great performances by actors I really hadn't heard of before. This film had me from the beginning all the way to the very unpredictable climactic ending. A great film that went under the radar. Buy this movie!!! I did and it's one of the best movies I have ever purchased. It's the Christian \\"Matrix\\".
B004LWZW4C|5.0|The story and screenplay give credit to six people total and the key to the success of this movie may be that one of those six people is Bryan Singer, the director of the first two X-Men films whose absence may have been what guided the last two films into mediocrity. His involvement, Vaughn as the director, and the changing of the time period all have significant impact on the film's success. The material seems much more at home in the 60s time period, while also helping to establish a different atmosphere and tone that separates it from the other films in the series.
0316056863|4.0|Tina Fey is awesomeness, and it was fantastic listening to her read \\"Bossypants\\" - her memoir about growing up as an awkward funny outspoken child into the sassy political comedic star she is now. I especially loved her feminist angle on just about everything, and her rants from blondes to bosses to begetting were pitch perfect and had me laughing out loud on several occasions. Bossypants is short (5.5 hours) and sweet and wise and funny. I highly recommend it.
B004INNRFK|5.0|David Foster is such a genius at producing and directing albums and his music is so great to listen to. He manages to get the right person to sing his music.  He is so talented and very down to earth as a person.  I often watch PBS and whenever they have a special with him, he gets right in and wants to talk to the people on the phone who are contributing to the station. His talent shows through the music he writes.  I love all of his music and it's a joy to watch him perform and interact with the singers.  Whenever he is on PBS or there's a special I always make a point to watch him. As his album, \\"The Hit Man\\" he is the \\"Man.\\"  I hope that he'll continue to have Specials and bring the multitude of performers back performing his songs. He is the best in his business!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm not a big fan of the 'revisions' that are in the movie but I look at it from a George Lucas perspective.  If he wanted these in here to add a little more humor/ emotion/ realism, so be it.  I don't mind a little tweaking.  Will it ruin the franchise?  No.  It will be an interesting change of pace from the previous films but that's why I'm buying these movies again...for the last time I hope.  EDIT: Received it, it rocks!!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am not dissing this collection for the questionable choices Lucas made in this latest revision, but because his greed apparently is insatiable. Having already sold these movies on VHS, then DVD, then in various Director's cuts, one would think George might have tired of milking this cow. But no, in keeping with the character he most resembles, Jabba the Hut, Lucas looks to gouge his fans for another $80.00.<br /><br />Not from me George. The only one of these movies I genuinely enjoy watching these days is the first, now fourth or fifth, who knows? I have it on DVD and don't need the minor improvements that Blu-Ray would bring. In fact I think that will merely highlight how lame it appears compared to today's CGI aided films.<br /><br />It is sad that someone who started out writing childlike movies about good and evil has gone to the dark side.

NO, we DON'T want some OTHER music called \\"Jedi Rocks\\" in celebration at the end of ROTJ (when John Williams wrote a *masterpiece* of a musical score - that practically MADE your movies what they became! - including the original Ewok song!) No, we DON'T want the CGI celebrations on all the other planets! No, we DON'T want a stupid \\"NOOOOOO!\\" added now into the movie audio either. No, we DON'T want Greedo to shoot first. No, we DON'T want Han Solo to call Jabba the Hut a fine \\"human being\\" in that extra scene. No, we DON'T want pointless CGI addition after pointless CGI addition! Leave it **ALL** alone. Your ONLY hope is to TURN FROM THE DARK SIDE of your revisionist work and release the originals in a cleaned-up and perserved quality. Until then, you and your Empire are dead to us.
0375846735|5.0|Whichever version of the book you get will not matter much, but this edition will add enjoyment to the finale of this epic. The series just keeps getting better. Everything comes together in this end to a trilogy that will live on in English literature.
B000NOKA0S|4.0|The songs are great as sung by a very young L. C. I bought this along with his most recent recording live in London. I tend to like the older (voice of ) L. C. But still a great collector's CD. A real classic recording by a really classy guy!!!!

I will not say it was worth the wait, (Holding a slight grudge still) but this is an excellent book.  Much like watching Jaws, and never seeing the monster till the end of the movie, Game of Thrones has kept us from truly seeing the Others, and has entertained us while we are waiting.<br /><br />Anticipation is growing and growing to see what the true problem is, (are the Others the point of this tale?)  and how Dragons and Dire Wolves will face them.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the next book!
B000001GQB|4.0|Okay, this is Mozart, and I like Mozart. But this is too much Mozart. After a while, except for maybe Symphony 41, all the music begins to blend together. There's not much variety nor diversity in this recording, albeit a good and worthy CD. Only if you are a die-hard Mozart fanatic should you buy this one. Enjoy!
0062007297|5.0|The book is wonderful, picture quality is high and identical to the hardcover book, so it's very much worth buying it. All who consider themselves fans of Bon Jovi can not fail to have this book in your collection! I recommend!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|If you want to learn about and listen to the real Leonard Cohen, this is the best CD. Although past 70 (I believe) at the time of this recording, his unmistakable voice, tunes, and lyrics are vintage Cohen. Don't be detered by the Live concert. This recording is masterful, and when L. C. speaks, the crowd cheers, and he is just as enjoyable as his singing. I highly recommend this CD; especially to young people, who, to me, don't know what real music is like. This just may help them mature...musically.

There are multiple free apps that stand on their own merit, not to mention Angry Birds is a monster franchise and should have its crap together before being launched out to take up memory. Instead, we just get crap in the form of force-close and lock-ups.
0071636080|5.0|This is one of the best How to... books on presentations. Recommended by a friend. I have nearly devoured its contents. This is a second purchase.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|BBC series are consistently of very high quality and this one is as good as it gets.  The camera work produces unbelievable shots of nature and the animal kingdom.

B005G48Y58|1.0|I read the reviews and can't believe any over one star are real. The movie is slow paced, substitues flashing lites for real action, and is a waste of an evening. Watched with my family and they are all blaming me for wasting the evening on a movie like this. Don't rent it!

I knew that consumers were rather disconnected from where their food comes from, but I didn't realize just HOW MUCH we were disconnected from our food and how it's processed.

B004SDEP38|4.0|Wish this had a better tutorial. Difficult to figure out how to manage folders and access keyboard...which is initially very frustrating. Once I figured out the swipe feature (which is buggy) I have found it a pleasure to use. Worth the money for the advanced version.
0060853972|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this tongue in cheek telling of the end of the world. Well, what was nearly the end anyway. I've enjoyed books written by both Pratchett and Gaiman individually, and this cooperative effort completely paid off. Completely in the spirit of a Douglas Adams book or Mel Brooks movie, this had me laughing out loud on several occasions. Even the author's notes at the end made me smile.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|I have been a Stevie Nicks/ Fleetwood Mac fan since the mid '70's when Rumors was released. I've seen both Fleetwood mac and Stevie Nicks in concert more times than I can remember. What I love so much about Stevie Nicks is how her music has changed and evolved as she has matured. All of her songs tell stories about events in her life. I feel as though I have grown up with her and as she [and I] mature, her songs come from the heart that allow me to feel a part of. As far as I am concerned, Stevie Nicks will always be the Queen of Rock & Roll. Her voice is as beautiful and unique today as it was when her and Lindsey first joined Fleetwood Mac in the early 70's. As is the quality of her writing ability. Stevie Nicks is like a fine wine, as she matures, her music obtains more depth and reasoning. She always shows the utmost in class and style. If you enjoy the sounds of Stevie Nicks as I do, you will own and thoroughly enjoy her newest CD, In Your Dreams.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Good little app that works without bugs. Wish it would update the levels more often. I finish a level then wait months for the next one to update. Other than that I love playing this game.

B002NPUCP8|4.0|I bought this originally for my 11 year old daughter who is starting to play guitar.  Having been a armature guitarist who was in a couple bands during my younger years, I really appreciate good guitarist.  As I listened to this, beyond some of the bubble gum lyrics, I spotted many influence of great guitarist in her style. Steve Via , of course, he even does a duet with her, but also Steve Morse, Eric Johnson and even I thought I caught a few Larry Carlton licks in there as well.  I think its great to see a well rounded master female guitar player. There have been a few, but not many , and less even lately. Well, less real musicians who play instruments and play them well with the advent of electronic  techno, samples and guitar hero.  Glad to see her and hope she does well. And I have to thank her for inspiring my daughters guitar ambitions as well.

B00364K6YW|5.0|How can you not love Pride and Prejudice? I had owned the tapes and then the first DVD's of this and they needed to be replaced. These are wonderful. Just what I needed. If your new to this and considering buying it, if you have seen the Keria Knightly version and liked it, this is not for you. Hollywood did a wonderful job of taking a great story and dumbing it down beyond belief, if you didn't like that version or want something true to the book, this is for you!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|When I was first introduced to this game by friends of my sister, I loved the challenge and intricacies that the game offered.  There are a lot of aspects of the game that gives it many different ways to develop strategy and gameplay varies with different opponents.  I played it a few times when I did visit home and was invited by my sister to play with her friends.  Her friend got it for her for Christmas and I bought her the 5-6 player extension.  She actually got busy and didn't play it again.  She got married and moved out and so I inherited the game.    I kept it around but didn't get around to playing it until a year later.  Once I taught my roommate, I re-kindled the love for the game and to a new level!  My roommate and I got so addicted for about a year of playing multiple times per week and attempting to lure in all new guests to our apartment if they were willing to learn.  We had a regular Settlers crew and I originally had the 3rd edition, but decided to sell it and the extension to invest into the whole set of the 4th edition bundle (Settlers + 5-6 player extension, Seafarers + 5-6 player extension, Cities & Knights + 5-6 player extension, Traders & Barbarians + 5-6 player extension).  There was never a dull moment with this game because once we got weary of the regular settlers, we busted open the expansions and enjoyed going into the water on other islands with Seafarers, duking it out with angry faces at each other in Cities & Knights, and we also tried a couple scenarios with Traders.  It was a different game when any of the expansions were thrown into the 5-6 player modes, where the maps are extended, but strategy changes too.    We even ventured into other strategy board games that were similar to Settlers, such as Dominion, Puerto Rico, Pandemic, and Carcassonne for a new spice to our board games lives.  However, despite enjoying the new games, there was nothing as strongly addicting as the drug we called \\"Settlers.\\"  We played it over and overand would crave playing when we haven't gotten together in a week to play.  Eventually the good times had to end though and half of our crew moved off to other ends of the nation and we still talk about the good ol' Settlers days.  In memory of the good old days, I bought the game again as a gift for one of the friends that moved away, just to remind her of the glory days and hopefully she'll infect some more people in her new neighborhood.    I now only play when the old Settlers crew gets together and also with coworkers who have occasional board game parties here and there.  I highly recommend this game!  It's one of the best things that have happened to me in my life :)
B0029NY9EE|1.0|It may just be me but I cannot get anything but Sense and Sensibility to come up on my kindle. There is no menu, no way to flip to the next book.

0743496728|3.0|This book had a flavor that was heavy on research into post-traumatic stress syndrome and light on characterization and plot. The main charcters were mostly cutouts with appropriate characteristics pasted on them and never really came to life, despite all their melting into tears, etc. It was highly repetitious, without deepening, and quite a slog as an audiobook, I waited vainly for some of the seeds planted as the book went on to bear fruit, be discussed, to better reveal the characters, to redeem relationships. But it didnt happen - the bare revelations in the 18th and last CD, without any kind of satisfactory exploration or closure, was very disappointing. And the ending that suggests some redemption for the parents but not the kids, aargh!    Three stars solely because it did cause me to give thought to my own experiences and thos of my children at school and because I did persist to the end.

B0027HOBM2|5.0|Season 2 of \\"Mad Men\\" is even better than Season 1. So much happens to these dynamic characters. We learn more and more about Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and his mysterious past. Meanwhile, Betty (January Jones) becomes an even more unstable and unlikeable character, in my opinion. She has a nervous breakdown and starts acting very out of character, and I hate everything that she does. I do not, however, despise Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) nearly as much as I did in Season 1. She really begins to come into her own this season and he character started growing on me like a fungus. Poor Roger (John Slattery) makes some incredibly stupid decisions regarding his personal life, as does Joan (Christina Hendricks), and I fear that things will just continue to get worse for these characters in Season 3. Sterling Cooper undergoes some significant changes by the end of Season 2, so it will be very interesting to see what happens next. BRING IT ON!!! I love this show!
030788743X|5.0|If you are a fan of the 80's and call yourself a gaming geek, then this book is for you.   Loved it and was shocked to all references to the 80's and everything that went with it.  Made me remember alot from then and the culture of the time.  Trust me this is a great read and it took everything I had to put it down.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|Why, oh why did it take me so long to start watching this show?! I love everything about it! \\"Mad Men\\" takes place in 1960 and follows the lives of the men (and women) who work for an ad agency on Madison Avenue in New York City. There is nothing bad about this show. My favorite thing about it is the overall look of the show. It's so beautiful, the costumes are gorgeous, everyone smoked and drank 24/7 because it was socially acceptable back then...what's now to like?!<br /><br />The main character, Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is a conflicted man. He has issues at work, issues at home, and a mysterious past that slowly begins to unravel as the season progresses. Don is married to Betty (January Jones), a picture-perfect housewife who is blonde and cute as a button, but I HATE HER!!! She is such a terrible person and I do not blame Don at all for all his philandering. There's an outstanding cast of supporting characters as well. I think Roger (John Slattery) and Joan (Christina Hendricks) are my favorites. Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) is super annoying and I hate her almost as much as I hate Betty (but not quite).<br /><br />I love that, because this is an AMC show and not an HBO show, there are a few curses uttered here and there, but no violence, no nudity, and no use of profanity every third or fourth word. Everything is elegantly implied, which is so great, especially for a show set in this era. I am so glad it's on AMC.<br /><br />The storylines are wonderful and I cannot wait to keep watching Seasons 2, 3, and 4!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is a crying shame that this series was canned after only one series. It is really superb viewing. The cast of characters grows on you from the start and each one has its own distinct personality. The plot of each episode is well thought out and original
1451629184|5.0|So I finished the book and cried when her mother said \\"My daughter has been found!\\". I could just feel the love & pain from that simple quote. I think the saddest part is how he turned something so beautiful (God's word) and turned it into something so twisted. While I see the beauty of God within her, I pray that Phillip's twisted ways don't pull her away from God's word & the truth. I don't want to say I liked the book because to \\"like\\" the book would be that I received some type of joy. However, I found it educational in the sense that we should not be so enclosed in are own world that we fail to reach out to others.

0156027321|1.0|This was a tremendous disappointment. Yann Martel's Life of Pi will feed anyone hungry for the abhorrent and gruesome. But first the author will promise that his story will make you believe in God. After getting you curious there, he will distract you and hope that you forgot he said it - as he will not present you with anything there.     This story is pointless, tasteless and instead of entertainment it will give you an upset stomach with no reward at all.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|I've posted before, in this same forum, but my views on this product have changed. First off, yes, I know we're all reviewing a product which has not yet been released, but with confirmation of the newest changes, I think it's safe to do so. I'm still on the fence about purchasing this set, and if I do get it, it will be mainly for the bonus features. I understand that they are George Lucas' films, and he is free to do whatever he wants to them, that's fine. But quite honestly, I think with the time they've spent making changes to the movies, they could have been re-mastering the originals. Of course, I've never personally re-mastered a classic film into HD format, so I don't know how long it takes, or how much it costs, but I'm sure that Lucas has the funds. If it would've taken more time, fine, push back the Blu-ray release date. So why aren't the originals included? Time... irrelevant, fans would readily wait longer for the best quality product. Cost... yeah right, with the original releases 30 years ago, all of the re-releases over the years, and of course the dozens of other films Lucas has released, the cost is irrelevant as well. Demand... well, apparently that's irrelevant to Lucas as well. Fans have wanted the originals ever since they were last released on VHS in the mid 90s. But hey, it is what it is, I'm just another reviewer amongst the crowd. I think most, if not all, of these negative reviews would not exist if the original films were included with this set, or even in a separate set, that way, fans could decide which versions of the films they would like to watch.
B005HEXQN2|5.0|The rating is based on my personal feelings, and may not reflect stellar performances or impeccable writing. Still, as a stew of actors, writing, premise, and imagination, this was a brilliant series that was over, in my opinion, long before it's time.<br /><br />It is a sad ending with what I felt was too short a finale. Personally, I was hoping for a season 8, 9, and 10, but then we might have been treated to a bunch of Stargate SG-1-esque final chapters. No thank you! (Shame on you Ben Browder and Claudia Black! You killed off Farscape, and then you had to kill SG1, too? Just kidding... or am I?)<br /><br />Perhaps this would have been a good place to end the Voyager series. The creators were leading up to it in several previous episodes; the regular communication with Star Fleet, the loss of key characters, the lack of major threats on the road ahead. Yes, we could have seen a return of the Borg, the Hirogen, the Vidiians, the Kazon, any of the other recurring threats, or even a new threat with similar tactics.<br /><br />The problem was that, like Harry said when asked why he was still such a low rank for a bridge officer, \\"It's a small ship. There are only so many positions available.\\" I think this rang true with the characters, there was little more you could do with them that did not threaten to deviate from their most endearing qualities. Perhaps they went out when fans still thought of them as interesting, and not old folks stuffed into uniforms bursting at the seams, their knees rickety and their actions stiff.<br /><br />Then again, I miss the characters and wish that some attempt at a collaboration would have ensued. A Star Trek movie doesn't always have to be based on a ship called Enterprise. I remember quite a few movies where the Enterprise was merely a footnote or a McGuffin for the chase.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Voyager cast's performances and thought they executed their roles well. Still, this show had problems. For one thing, I thought the writers or directors had some sort of difficulty in dealing with the characters and popularity. Kes, and her actor, Jennifer Lien, should not have been let go just to bring on Jeri Ryan's Seven of Nine. The problem was that the role both characters filled was the fish-out-of-water mentor-needing alien who would help to highlight Captain Janeway's wisdom and her human fallibility. What to do with Kes if Seven suddenly has all those lines? It's not like Kes was appearing in every episode. It seemed the show's creators were loathe to use her, but were contractually obligated to do so. They would haul her out to do make some obscure reference, ask a critical question, or give the other characters a much-needed nudge in the right direction, and then shove her back in the closet.<br /><br />In the end of the franchise, however, it seemed that Star Trek had a case of \\"boobie fever\\". I think Jeri Ryan is an exceptional actor, and if her singing was real, vocalist as well. However, I don't think any of that got her a job. She had two great references up front, and one \\"behind\\" her. Star Trek: DS9 did the same thing, and it always seems to come when the writing becomes the weakest.<br /><br />One last gripe from me was a true \\"Where are they now?\\" epilogue of events. Did the Maquis crew members find absolution on Earth? Did Seven of Nine run off, shave her hair, don an orange toga and become a Buddhist? Did Janeway take her new beau to a red carpet movie premier and make her old fiance jealous? Did Tuvok take up tennis, or the Doctor insight a holo-revolution?<br /><br />THAT could have been the movie right THERE! The Doc meets up with his mining dopple-gangers and finds an eager audience, at first. But then, the holo-slaves (Note- Why didn't Janeway use Commander Data's battle for recognized sentience as a precedent in the Doctor's case?)decide to spread out and take out posts all over the Neutral Zone, go back in time, rob Tuvok of his Katra, which would be installed in Lt. Paris, B'ellana's babe, Kuvah'magh, could be left on a planet experiencing hyper-evolution and become an instant adult, go back to the M-class planet and become the emperor of the New Klingon Empire, Delta Quadrant Division. Janeway can get assimilated again, become Kathcutus of Borg, lead an assault of the Gamma Quadrant against the remnants of the Dominion and its Founders, and Captain Sisko can provide the McGuffin or Deus Ex Machina that will save the day. Moral of the story, don't give up the writing ghost. There's lots of stuff that can still be done, and it doesn't all have to be wiped out by that modern Star Trek reboot's time-screw debacle.<br /><br />Star Trek: Voyager, we miss you.

The booklet (especially with the release of the Blu-ray) is sort of obsolete, as it's essentially the same thing that comes with the BD. I would have preferred if The Dude Abides magnet had a frame where the Dude actually says \\"Yeah, well...The Dude Abides,\\" but beggars can't be choosers. I haven't used the coffee mug yet, because I'm not sure I want to stain it. All in all, it's a good gift for any Duderino looking for some memorabilia.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|So I popped NORTH & SOUTH into my DVD player, and imagine my surprise when scenes of the American Civil War failed to appear on the screen. This is instead the BBC adaptation of the classic novel by 19th century author Elizabeth Gaskell. And while there are no Johnny Rebs or Patrick Swayzes lurking about, there is a union. There is even a skirmish of sorts engaged between calculating factory owners and despairing laborers on strike. Nothing about any of that would lead you to believe that this is one of them timeless romances over which girls tend to swoon. But I haven't yet mentioned Margaret Hale, brought to life vividly by a marvelous actress named Daniela Denby-Ashe.<br /><br />Temporarily put aside the love story, and the central theme would revolve around the bridging of the social divide in the Victorian era. Margaret Hale, our young heroine, finds it difficult to adapt to her unfamiliar new environs. Torn from her priveleged life in bucolic southern England, she eyes the booming industrial northern town of Milton and sees much that disgusts her: the squalor, the furor, the common folk's open hostility, that air of desperation. Absorbing her particular scorn is sullen local mill owner John Thornton (Richard Armitage) whose abusive treatment of an employee instantly prejudices Margaret against him. Imagine her distaste when she learns that John Thornton is her minister father's new pupil in the Classics. Right about now, you're perhaps sensing echoes of Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE. And there is a parallel to how the romance in both novels plays out. Except that NORTH & SOUTH commands even more of an investment into the story. PRIDE & PREJUDICE is fraught with wit and lightheartedness. NORTH & SOUTH is bleaker and more somber and offers deeper insight into the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of its time and place. Side characters such as Thornton's stern Yorkshire-accented mother (Sin&eacute;ad Cusack) and Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle), the passionate union leader, are crucial to plot development.<br /><br />Period dramas aren't normally in my wheel house. To me, a Brontë is a kind of dinosaur and a Hawthorne is a cancelled show on TNT. But I think Jane Austen crosses all barriers, and I find her more accessible than Dickens. Somewhere in the ether, Elizabeth Gaskell may resent hearing this, but if not for Jane Austen, I wouldn't even come near a Gaskell adaptation. The BBC teleplay, told in four episodes, somehow draws me into its tale of labor strikes and factory closures, elements which in any other story would render me not giving an ef. But the union stuff works because it serves as a backdrop to Margaret and Thornton's tempestuous yet understated romance. Class distinction is pretty much the crux of the conflict between the two central characters. That, and a misunderstanding involving Margaret's fugitive brother.<br /><br />Margaret is someone who doesn't bow down to conventions. An outsider to Milton, she doesn't hesitate to befriend those beneath her social status. Her ties to both the ruling and working classes lend her a unique perspective. Her outspoken nature incenses Thornton. But it also intrigues him. Thornton's mother isn't so conflicted. She straight up loathes Margaret.<br /><br />One step forward. Two steps back. That sums up Margaret and Thornton's relationship. Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage strike a spark and keep it lit. Denby-Ashe breathes life into Margaret, a modern girl trapped in a Victorian era corset, a restricting happenstance she shares with the equally independent Miss Elizabeth Bennett. Margaret doesn't shy away from speaking her own mind. As Denby-Ashe comments in the DVD's production notes, Margaret boldly looks people in the eye when she converses with them, an act which women in those days generally tend to not do. Meanwhile, Richard Armitage's superpower must be scowling. He lends a brooding intensity to his character, and first impressions would dictate that his character must be a tyrannical master who subjects his worker to abuse. Except that each progressive episode peels away another layer of his character, reveals his sensitivity and innate decency and awful loneliness. The moments in episode 4 in which Thornton shares the dinner table with Mr. Higgins and his other employees are understated but pretty moving. NORTH & SOUTH runs for four hours, not that you feel the length. I haven't read the book, but I venture to say that this is one of the finest adaptations ever put to screen. The production values are convincing and immersive. The screenplay is absorbing. The acting is stellar. In a bloody face-off between these two NORTH & SOUTH mini-series, Patrick Swayze just wilted under one of Richard Armitage's unconvivial scowls.<br /><br />Special features: audio commentary on episodes 1 & 4 with producer Kate Bartlett, director Brian Percival and screenplay writer Sandy Welch; an interview with Richard Armitage (00:11:30 minutes long); 5 Deleted Scenes, including an extended proposal scene (00:11:38 minutes long); cast biographies with an in-depth look into the actors' roles in NORTH & SOUTH; and production notes.aracter must be a tyrannical master who subjects his worker to abuse.

030788743X|5.0|One of those books you don't want to put down and you don't want to end. That said, the climax and conclusion are a bit abrupt and don't really tie things up very satisfactorily, at least not for this reader. Perhaps there'll be a sequel some day? One of the best books I've read in years.
B0000041DF|5.0|I first heard Martha Argerich live in a recital in the early sixties when she was starting her career. The memory of Bach's Partita No.6 still fresh in my mind. It was clear then that she would soon join the ranks of the greatest pianists of all time. However,I never became one o her true fans since often I disliked her tendency to nervous, urgent and extremely fast tempos. I like my music to breathe and this lady wouldn't give any breaks. My local classical radio station plays her Tchaikovsky 1 and been the stupid collector that I am (What, do I have at least 20 versions of the Tchaikovsky?),and since it came with the Rachmaninov third that makes a lot of people go crazy, I knew I had to get it! Both these concertos can't be played any better than this, period. My only complaint is that these are live recordings and while you supposedly have as a benefit the emotion of her white hot performances, I would have preferred a studio recording with the piano a little more in front of the orchestra. As it is, some of her marvelous playing at the lower end of the instrument is difficult to hear. The Rachmaninov (1982)is the uncut version and Chailly and the RSO Berlin give her great support, although you can tell they are not in the top tier of the world leading orchestras. Better still is the Bavarian Radio S.O. with the great Kondrashin in the Tchaikovsky (recorded in 1980). The Bavarian orchestra is a real joy to listen to, been nowdays as good or even better than the Berlin Phil. So this is a record that any classical piano devotee has to have.<br />Competition in this field is tremendous,in the uncut Rachmaninov you will do well with the historic Van Cliburn/Kondrashin;Vasary/Aronovitch;Gabrilov/Muti; and recently Ansdnes/Berglund? In the abridged version Orozco/De Waart and Wild/Horenstein are supreme. In the Tchaikovsky I always return to Gilels/Mehta and the old Serebriakov/Mravinsky(Westminster LP vynil)if you can find it! Don't waste any time (as I did) to get this CD before Phillips (or whatever company owns them) decides to throw it out of the catalogue, to make room for some Lang Lang stuff.D before Phillips (or whatever company owns them) decides to throw it out of the catalogue, to make room for some Lang Lang stuff.
B00005YUNY|5.0|This is an awesome concert! The core lineup of Yes (Anderson, Howe, White, and Squire) along with the excellent (and energetic) symphony as well as a keyboardist all do a tremendous job. Jon Anderson sounds amazing, Chris Squire does a great job of showing off his bass skills, Steve Howe amazes, as always, and while Alan White is a bit buried in the mix, he also sounds wonderful.    Standouts include an awe inspiring Ritual (even my wife, a person who respects Yes but is not nuts about them, thought it was the best song and she absolutely loved it!) and the three songs off of Magnification (In the Presence Of, Don't Go, and Magnification), and only one song disappointed: Owner of a Lonely Heart. Not sure why they included it at all!    Great footage, sound quality is generally excellent, and the crowd appears to be having a great time. I didn't care for the weird little animations and some other stuff they showed ocassionally, but regardless, this was a concert well worth the money and one I will watch again and again.    Even if you don't like 80s/90s/2000s Yes (I love all of it except for Talk and Open Your Eyes, which I can't even listen to!), you will find plenty to like since it mostly covers material from the 1970s.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Toward the end of this documentary, a quote by Upton Sinclair is given that states, \\"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\\" Such is the difficulty in trying to get the average citizen to understand climate change (\\"global warming\\" as it is called in this movie) and to do something about it. It is a great documentary on a crucial issue, though the argument isn't very strong and there really isn't any solution espoused.    To begin, the premise is wrong. Early on it is stated that global warming is a moral issue, not a political one. But then they go on to make a political argument.    Then, the rationale behind the argument is not really put together well. It is assumed that we need to measure CO2--but why does this help the study? It is assumed that CO2 causes a rise in temperature--but why is this the case? It is assumed that CO2 is a man-made pollutant--but the documentary even states that 30% of the CO2 comes from forest fires. Finally, it is assumed that higher CO2 is the cause and not just correlated to a rise in temperatures--but how can a scientist be sure that the rise in temperature does not cause a rise in CO2? None of these questions are answered or even explored satisfactorily.    The proof of global warming is fairly weak as well. We see pictures of melted snow caps and glaciers. But, one wonders, is this not possibly just a part of normal cycles? The snow cap that I lived by for years would disappear every summer--it's a natural cycle. The skeptic is left with more questions than answers. How common is it in history for glaciers to melt? Are there any glaciers forming elsewhere to compensate for the melting ones?    To be fair, the documentary does not claim to make the argument for or against Al Gore's proposed changes. It is designed to simply convey the story of his outreach program. Still, I can't imagine anyone wanting to watch this program and not receive a good case for globalwarming. Unfortunately, it is not here. The documentary is more than anything a well-made question provoker. For that it is worth watching. Just don't hope for a definitive argument one way or the other.

B004OGDW4M|4.0|I've been a major fan of Tennstedt's Mahler and looked forward to finally having the complete set of his Symphonies. However, this and the earlier set that came out in the late 90s has packaged the symphonies to get maximum minutes per-disk, and in the process left most of the symphonies to continue on to a second disk on which is the beginning of yet another symphony.<br /><br />Disk<br />#1 - 1st Symphony and first movement of 2nd Symphony<br />#2 - Conclusion of 2nd Symphony<br />#3 - 3rd Symphony first four movements<br />#4 - 3rd Symphony Final Movement / 4th Symphony<br />#5 - 5th Symphony (Whew!)<br />#6 - 7th Symphony first four movements<br />#7 - 7th Symphony Concluded / 6th Symphony first 3 movements<br />#8 - 6th Symphony Final Movement / 8th Symphony  Beginning<br />#9 - 8th Symphony Conclusion /<br />#10 - 9th Symphony first three movements<br />#11 - 9th Symphony concluded / 10th Symphony Adagio<br /><br />This has six symphonies crossing over into a second disk. Of the three sets I own, only the second Bernstein set has this happen more than once (two times, and both make better sense). With one or two of the recorded song cycles included (all available from EMI), this could have been managed better.<br /><br />Recommended only for Tennstedt lovers with an iPOD so these can be separated into meaningfully arranged performances.
B001RP1G0U|5.0|I love Diane Lane and John Cusask in any movie they do.  It seemed real and the music was wonderfully timed.  Top notch actors aside from the main two(Elizabeth Perkins, Christopher Plummer to name a few)and all done with humor, love & a bit of the  unexpected.  It was very real the feelings the characters went thru with age and the world around them.  A wonderful movie that I highly recommend.  Hope you give it a chance~

B0059R5Q08|1.0|This adaptation was poorly done. Much was left out of the story and the decision to start the film at the end was doubly confusing. If I did not have a good understanding of the plot - I would have been woefully lost while viewing this version.    The chemistry that NEEDS to build between Rochester and Jane was never allowed to blossom nor were the actors suited for this purpose.  Mia Wasikowska (Jane) was completely one dimensional and Michael Fassbender (Mr. Rochester), though intended to be disliked at first, never rose above that sentiment for me. If I were Jane, I would have run from him!    Adding to the poor casting was the poor cinematography (is Jane's world really a constant greenish-gray color?) as well as the fact that it was just plain boring. Even Judi Dench (Mrs. Fairfax), who I admire as a quality actress, could not liven this script.    Read the book and you will understand.    I recommend the 1996 adaption that features William Hurt as Rochester and as Charlotte Gainsbourg Jane Eyre. Chemistry,chemistry, chemistry! And a good retelling of the story.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|i love, love, love this dvd!!! i saw it recently on public tv and was thrilled to find it on amazon. i am a huge fan of les miz and saw the traveling production 3times when it came to my city. the voices in this rendition are all outstanding...with the notable exception of nick jonas, who just seems out of place and too weak to be in the company of the other much stronger voices and more experienced actors. i can't imagine how this casting decision got made!! another great feature of this dvd comes at the end, when the former jean valjeans come onstage and sing together...thrilling! everybody connected to this production shows such obvious love and joy for it...and that is quite contagious. i look forward to many future viewings.

One of the ear cuffs broke off at the swivel point after less than a month. I figured it was because I was carrying them in my backpack, so I cut my losses and bought another pair because I liked the sound quality. I have no idea how it happened, but in less than two weeks, the ear cuff broke off at the same point. Complete pieces of junk the way they are designed. I should have listened to all the negative reviews saying how weak they are.    Do yourself a favor and spend like $20 more on the new Sony PS3 wireless stereo headset for the PS3, which is what I'm about to do now.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Hey guess what, Han Solo is still in these movies. So is Luke, Vader and the slew of characters that you knew and loved as children.  So what if the scenes have been altered and dialogue added?  It's a FANTASY movie. I love these movies,grew up with them and feel that I have a certain ownership to them, and like many of you when the extras for the re-release in 97 were revealed I was a bit dismayed--but overall the story and characters remain the same.  Let's get this straight people: We don't own any of these characters, Lucasfilm does.  Whatever Lucas decides to do with these films is his prerogative.  The reason I am buying this set is so that my Son can enjoy these movies with me--regardless of how they have been changed. It will be new to him--and hopefully he will love them like I love them--and their many different iterations.  Take off the rose colored nostalgia tinted glasses and just man up and either buy or don't buy the product!!!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|It's really simple. People in 1977 loved your film. For many years after, people loved them. When I was growing up in the early 90s, I loved them as well. But even at the age of 12 when the \\"Special Editions\\" came out, I knew something wasn't right with them. I had grown attached to the original trilogy, the way the story was meant to be told, and the additions of the \\"Special\\" versions did not fit in. The new stuff didn't add anything. All of it was just fluff, never intended to be in the film in the first place, with the obvious exception of the Jabba extra scene, and even that was butchered. If it didn't fit in anymore, just leave it as a bonus on the DVD and move on, that CG mess was completely uncalled for.     As a student of film, and avid lover of the art of film, the fact that not only would you, Mr. Lucas (I know he probably won't be reading this, but still), shrug off the complaints of your first bout with \\"special enhancements\\", but you would further insult when we finally get to see these films in an HD format. It shows a total disregard for the art of filmmaking. What happened to your love the work of Kurosawa? Do you think he would ever do such a thing? Maybe add a CG horde of bandits to Seven Samurai, or a loud melodramatic \\"Nooo!\\" to the solemn ending to Ikiru? No, it would never happen, because Kurosawa was an artist, and I'm beginning to think that you aren't and probably never were. I can understand the feeling of not being satisfied with something that you've done. Most people probably can relate to that. But the finished product was cherished by many, many people, and it belongs to them just as much as it belongs to you.     I know that you're a business man first, and a filmmaker second. I know that despite the thousands, maybe millions of dissenting voices you'll hear over this will probably fall on deaf ears. But I urge you to think back to the late 70s, when you were a struggling artist who nearly killed himself to bring his vision to the world. How would that young man view what you have become today? Bottom line, your fans are just that for a reason, because you made a wonderful piece of art. Please, stop insulting them.
B005CM1IMU|4.0|I'm speaking as somebody from the outside. I have seen the movie in theaters. I have even attended a couple midnight showings. However there is a difference between a casual observer and long term participant, so I am speaking to all of you who aren't the \\"freaks\\" or \\"misfits\\" (badges of honor for those in the know) who have intimate knowledge of this film. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is probably the most notorious cult movie in existence. Not because of overtly controversial content or the film being connected to some kind of scandal. It's this way because this quirky movie hit a soft spot for a whole cultural set of people all over the world. The movie is hard to categorize, but in it's pure form it is a musical (such as it's based on the musical of the same name). It's a crazy horror/comedy/sci-fi/50's tribute kind of musical. But a musical nonetheless.     The movie (and original musical) was the brainchild of Richard O'Brien, who set out to make a parody of the B-Movies of the 40's and 50's. What the end result was the craziest of mismatches. You have elements of the mad scientist and his creation along with aliens from another planet all mixed in with bizarre love triangles and unexpected tangents no other cult movie has pulled off since. You want it in one word? Wacky. Two words? Perverted wacky. Not in a softcore adult film kind of way, but in a lets-poke-fun-at-as-many-sexual-taboos-as-you-can sort of way. Aliens from the planet Transexual? Transvestite mad doctor who creates a boy toy while seducing a straight couple? Incest (alien incest at that)? Cannibalism? Sounds like a horrible movie, but all of this... ALL of it... is done tongue in cheek and often times in song and dance.    The script and acting all delve into the melodrama of the very movies Rocky Horror parodies. The writing makes the perverted wackiness vehicles for either quick B-movie styled shocks or peppy rock and roll musical numbers. It helps having a stellar cast. Tim Curry cut his teeth doing the musical version of this movie on stage, and got a name for himself as the absolutely over-the-top Dr. Frank-N-Furter. Meatloaf lends his charismatic singing chops as Eddie in a motorcycle riding musical number. Rising stars Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick both play the straight roles with much intended camp. Even creator Richard O'Brien serves a supporting role as the creepy Riff Raff. You can tell the whole cast was having a blast making this film.     As a musical the songs are just as much important as the script. As this is a tribute to the 40's and 50's era drive-in type film the music is very much rockabilly and Grease-style songs. You get some high energy songs running the gamut of emotion and even absurdity. You also get some more musical-type songs as well. All the while you get lyrics that are peppered with references to various 40's and 50's movies that move like a love letter to the era. Then they throw in a song like Sweet Transvestite and you're back in the crazy fray. As a movie from the 70's mocking movies from yesteryear the incidental things like special effects are intentionally cheesy. The sets, however, scream atmosphere in both the elaborate settings and the more simple ones.     This Blu-Ray release marks the 35th anniversary of the movie's release and as such makes the best send off to date. Visually it won't get any better with this disk sporting an almost pristine transfer from the original film negatives. There almost zero compression on this transfer. Audio is an even better treat with DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround. Even though the movie was originally done in mono they really do a bang up job with the surround. Just wait until you hear the musical numbers on this disk (in surround sound). It will blow your mind.     There is also a very nice array of extras, including the stuff from previous DVD releases. One of the sweeter features is you get both the U.S. and U.K. versions of the film (that means the Superhero endingis available). Here is the breakdown of the bonus content (in 1080p unless noted):    - Commentary by Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn    - The Midnight Experience: This needs a bit of explanation. There are a series of options you can tag to the film that gives trivia pop ups, vintage call back track (what you scream back at the film during the midnight showings), Picture-in-Picture view of midnight showing shadowcast members acting out with the film, even something they call a Prop Box for throwing virtual items on the screen.     -  The Search for the 35th Anniversary Shadowcast: You that part of the Midnight Experience with the shadowcast playing out the movie? Well here is an hour long documentary on getting that cast together. Apparently they went all over the world looking for the right people.     - Rocky-Oke: Sing It!: It's Rocky Horror karaoke. You get a lyric sheet to sing along with the scores of musical numbers in the movie. You can even take out the original singing and have essentially an instrument track much like your standard karaoke.     - Alternate Black and White opening scene    - Mick Rock (A Photographer): A quick documentary on the on location photographer. This feature is in 1080i.     - Mick Rock's Picture Show: A photo gallery of Mick Rock's work.     All the previously released features are in a section called A Few From the Vault. Included in the vault is a high definition pressbook that allows you to read all the material along with a poster gallery. The rest are all still in standard definition. Here's what you get:    - Rocky Horror Double Feature Video Show: A retrospective running a little over a half hour.     - Two deleted musical scenes    - Alternate outtakes: 11 of them to be exact.     - Alternate end credits    - Beacon Theater 10th Anniversary: Footage from a crazy midnight showing.     - Theatrical Trailers    Really the only way to experience The Rocky Horror Picture Show was to see it during it's heyday on one of the many midnight showings. Then again you may not have caught all the subtle nuances of the movie what with all the raucous going on. If that's the case then this Blu-Ray is the next best thing with amazing sound and visuals and a slew of good features. I have to admit this movie is an acquired taste and you have to be able to see it for the parody it is to appreciate it. If you are, or could be, a fan of camp then get ready for the most outrageous camp that ever came out of the 70's.      - Time Warp Music Video: This was from the 15th Anniversary VHS release.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I've been an avid Marvel and X-men fan since my childhood. I grew up with the acclaimed \\"90's X-Men\\" cartoon (I HIGHLY recommend those on Amazon). X-Men First Class is a great comic book film despite it's lack of proper characters/timelines (most won't notice). It's the best X-Men related film thus far by far. The perfomance by Magneto is enough reason to see this. Stop reading my review and buy this already. Even most non comic/action fans (such as your girlfriend) will likely enjoy this. You also receive a credit towards Marvel digital comics, so that's another incentive. Again, I recommend.

0470876417|2.0|I hate to write a bland review of such a beautiful book that a LOT of work went into...but that's just it: it's a lovely book and a lot of art direction and all that went into it, and it just makes it feel like a coffee table book, not a serious business book about serious concepts.     It feels comic-bookish and is very hard to read because of its lack of flow. Really hard to take anything from this book if you are used to traditional left-to-right reading.
B0050PYNN0|3.0|A predictable but fun fairy tale of an immature, whiny prince (Danny McBride) who is constantly outdone by his overall awesome brother (James Franco) who later needs his help to rescue his bride to be from an evil wizard. The humor is hit or miss but there are some good parts. The tale itself follows the typical fairy tale path and keeps you engaged well enough. Back to the humor . . . it tends to be immature, juvenile, bawdy, silly and even offensive to some people. It lacks the sparkling wit or \\"aha!\\" moments of PRINCESS BRIDE so in some ways I consider it a lesser version of PB. The making of this film was $50M but it made around 26M gross in global theaters and another $3M in DVDs as of a month ago according to one viable web source. Critics were unjustly harsh towards this film. I think it tried to be a number of things and only hit a few of them. In addition, the special effects were below par of what I would have expected. Fairy tale fans should check it out but for the rest I would say it might be worth a look at best.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; HUMOR: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: 2011 (unrated version); OVERALL GRADE: B minus (higher if you're a fantasy/fairy tale fan).
1591840562|2.0|This book feels like the book of Proverbs: it's a bunch of one-liners and anecdotes and there's no prose or flow. I know it's not supposed to be a Harry Potter storybook...but it just doesn't flow well. Too many bullet points and not a lot of substance. Just stories and maxims from this guy.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Personally I think this is the best Dexter season yet. Lumen was a fascinating addition and for once someone that Dexter didn't need to kill off at the end of the season. Also it was interesting to see Dexter coping with grief. Absolutely worth owning!

0618918248|5.0|Quite simply the best book on the subject.  Clear and concise arguments and explanations from cover to cover.  I had been religious all my life and had become a bit of a skeptic in the past few years.  My thoughts in buying this book were that if my beliefs could hold up to careful scrutiny when they were worth keeping.  For me I was not content to sit on the fence when it came to 'the god issue'.     For anyone on the fence when it comes to the issue of god, this book will convince you that it is an electric fence and there is only dry ground on one side of this issue.  Choose wisely and pick up a copy.

630469654X|5.0|Ladyhawke, though released in 1985, is timeless. Matthew Broderick, Rutger Hauer, and Michelle Pfeiffer create a medieval world of innocence and evil that is credible even with modern audiences. No element of the movie overshadows the others, so the balance of action, thought, and romance is emotionally satisfying.
0811876373|5.0|I made my first set of cake pops before I bought this book, and although they were cute and delicious, had I had this book beforehand, they would have been AWESOME!! The tips and hints she gives you to make the perfect cake pop is well worth the price of the book (i.e. which type of frosting to use and how to make your candy coating just perfect for dipping etc.)  My first attempt took me way longer than I had expected and I was getting very frustrated that it wasn't going very smoothly. Now that I know some of the hidden secrets, I'm anxious to get back in the kitchen and try these again.  Just remember that even if you don't own this book, your cake pops will still be delicious even if they don't resemble works of art!!
0547258305|5.0|I am first and foremost, a fantasy lover. It has, and probably always will be my favorite genre. Kristin Cashore takes all the elements that one would find in an epic fantasy tale, and craft it into a stunningly well-written young adult novel. The world-building is simplified yet satisfying. It even includes a map at the beginning (which I absolutely adore!). The well-developed characters are not overwhelming in number, a common occurrence in adult fantasy. I think this is a great title for someone to pick up if they are perhaps transition from young adult to fantasy or vice versa.<br /><br />In a land where being a Graceling is feared and avoided, there are non more formidable than Katsa. Her grace is the ability to kill with ease. Her name and the stories of the acts she was forced to commit on behalf of her king (and uncle) have reached all Seven Kingdoms. Her tell-tale one blue, one green eye is the last thing anyone wants to see on their doorstep. Katsa didn't choose this life. She doesn't want to commit these despicable acts just because she can. Doing something good with her Grace was the only way to combat the feelings of hatred for what she is welling up inside of her. Katsa creates The Council where she, basically, punishes evil men of the kingdoms and rights the wrongs. A medieval, female, Batman if you will. So on one of these missiones, Katsa meets another Graceling fighter, the Lienid prince, Po. She makes quick work of him with her ninja skills, and succinctly drops him to the ground to carry on her missive.<br /><br />But Po is not done with Katsa. Of course, there has got to be a bit of romance going on in this book. And, as you might be able to surmise, it is not a damsel in distress, hero on horseback type romance. Katsa and Po find their connection through their unique yet frightening graces. Their long and treacherous journey across the Seven Kingdoms on the quest to find out the truth behind a kidnapping, bring them together in a way that is deep and soulful. Even though this book has some dark themes and events, it is not without its humor. The following is a humorous passage about Katsa trying to hide her true feelings from Po:<br /><br />\\"She glanced up at him, and in that moment he pulled his wet shirt over his head. She forced her mind blank. Blank as a new sheet of paper, blank as a starless sky. He came to the fire and crouched before it. He rubbed the water from his bare arms and flicked it into the flames. She stared at the goose and sliced his drumstick carefully and thought of the blankest expression on the blankest face she could possibly imagine.\\" - pg 192<br /><br />The relationship between Katsa and Po is so wonderful. It isn't the typical immediate affection or constant musings that is prevalent in other books, it is a romance built on a true connection and likeness of mind and convictions.<br /><br />Technically, Graceling is a standalone novel, but there is a companion book out there that has one main character in common with the characters in Graceling. And while, I'm disappointed it isn't going to continue the story of Katsa and Po, I did read the prologue and I cannot wait to pick up a copy of Fire.Even though this book has some dark themes and events, it is not without its humor.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|George, read all the negative reviews.  You are missing out on lots of $$'s.  Put out the classic versions.  I'll never buy the hacked up versions you have here.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|When received the DVD, the discs were in good condition; I was wary about that because of what I heard from the reviews! The packaging is not really that hard to handle,  you just have to be a little bit more careful with the discs. The discs are sitting on a flap of hard paper or something, so to avoid getting scratches on it, all you have to do is pull the flap out and then get the disc, not that bad. The breaks in between the movies really isn't that bad, all you have to do is switch the disc. I haven't looked at all the contents on the third disc, but I'm sure there amazing too. Overall, I think this was a worthy purchase. Definitely worth the money, such a fantastic movie. Oh, and I hate 3D effects in movies, I think they are pointless. I like to focus on the stories and characters more, how it looks in the 2D version is already amazing. I personally hate that now they are coming up with 3D everything, so unnecessary and annoying. 2D movies + animation FTW!

B005F3XV62|1.0|another romantic comedy, hmm let's see.  First start with Kevin James who is a Zookeeper who was in love with Leslie Bibb's character.  His failed proposal five year earlier still has him heartbroken for her.  When this former flame reenters his life he suddenly finds his ability to talk to animals.  The animals in the zoo attempt to help Kevin James score with his ex in very crude and unfunny ways.  Eventually he realizes that he has moved on and now actually is in love with the Zoo's vet played by Rosario Dawson.  The whole movie is one giant stupid animal joke after another.  I suppose if you are a 13 or 14 year old this movie would actually be funny but for the rest of us it got old very quick.  The chemistry between Kevin James and Leslie's Bibb's characters are very fake and unbelieveable at best.  The only real spark in this movie at all is Rosario Dawson, who is surprisingly strong for such a weak story.  My best advice is to pass on this.

B001E45XT4|5.0|The bad: it is bulky, and it doesn't fold in to travel well. The good: Everything else. The sound is the most magnificent i have ever heard, the sound cancellation isn't absolute but you need to be able to hear someone intruding in your house, so it is completely forgiveable. The comfort on my head is awesome, the fold in microphone is a wonderful feature though i feel like i'm going to hurt it when trying to extend it sometimes. For the quality matching the price, i would recommend this to anyone who likes to enjoy music, movies or video games on a computer.

1439170916|5.0|My husband's oncologist suggested this book by prefacing that normally he does not like to spend his free time reading about cancer since he spends most of his day dealing with that disease and patients.  But he found this book really was enjoyable and informative and suggested that we might wish to read it.  Since it hit so close to home (my husband has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), we were a little hesitant about the subject, thinking it might be a bit depressing.  Instead, we found it fascinating and uplifting.  The author has obviously done years of research on this subject and he is not only charmingly prosaic but comes across as just the sort of doctor you would love to have if you had cancer (just like the one we have!) - caring, sympathetic and knowledgeable.  Dr. Mukherjee offers interesting and informative insight into the various cancers and how the treatments have evolved over the years.  My husband and I found this book to be an encouraging look into the future of cancer research for not only our generation but for that of our children and grandchildren.  Cancer has, indeed, come \\"out of the closet\\" in the past forty years and this book is proof of that in so many ways.

And why risk a bad day at the office when your surrogate can go FOR you? And if you have a hazardous job{like the military or police do},just send your surrogate out in your place so you don't have to take any risks!Just what mankind was looking for!But there's a fly in the ointment!Recently,someone has been destroying the surrogates,and worse than that,they are using some sort of 'secret' weapon that by-passes the surrogates fail-safes and also kills their human operators!This is when Bruce Willis{who works for the FBI}is brought in -- that is, his surrogate is brought in!Surrogates has a lot of action and good special effects in it,it also has a good plot to it.Although I've described it here so everyone can understand it,if you really want to understand the movie,you have to see it 3 or 4 times.I need to empathize this -- IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE,YOU HAVE TO SEE IT 3 OR 4 TIMES!! If you have seen it only once,there is NO WAY you're going to understand it!That's because most of the 'people'you see in this movie are surrogates!You have to keep in mind that the actual people are back at their homes CONTROLLING the surrogates!That's what makes the movie hard to understand -- you have to keep in mind what's really going on! Themovie comes at you so fast in so little time{it's only about 90 minutes long}that you really have to see it more than once.If you want to get the 'small details',you'll have to see it 3 or 4 times.I've seen reviews where people didn't like this movie -- mostly because they only saw it once.There's no way you'll understand this movie if you've only seen it once.Some have said it could have been longer or there could be more character developement.That's probably true.But because the movie is so short and it comes at you so fast,you'll need to see it more than once!The movie also has a surprise ending to it -- one that will get you to thinking!

B005KAH7QU|1.0|I had very high hopes for this movie, but I was completely disappointed! First, the storyline/plot lacks detail; I had no idea what was going on.  Next, the lack of focus. Maybe I missed the point from the start which would have been crucial to the rest of the film, but it wouldn't have mattered because there was very little dialogue between the actors  anyway.  Hanna sucked, bottom line!
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Thing is, should this be a review for the movie, or review for the home version and it's missing contents?  That is the question.  I'm giving this 5 stars for the movie alone, which was wonderful, just a bit long.  Now I read the novel first, I wish I hadn't.  The novel was great, and the movie follows the books to a \\"T\\".  We follow the wanna-be conspiracy with what's on the other side of the moon, Prime's anger over this, and Sam's story following the human interaction and deaths behind what the artifacts on the moon.  We can't have Transformers without Decepticons working with a few humans.  Where is Dr. Arkevil when you need him, eh Starscream?  Thing is, this movie is right up every Transformer fan who knows the G1 stories inside and out.  The movie weaves the basic stories behind \\"More than meets the eye\\" and \\"Megatron's Master Plan\\" perfectly.  Funny thing is, in the cartoon, Megatron simply \\"lifted\\" Lincoln of his memorial and sat down in one of the old episodes...not this new Megatron!  We finally see some new Transformer characters brought from the woodworks out of history from Sentinel Prime, Shockwave, and Laserbeak(who nearly steals the movie, in my opinion).  Plenty of action, and comedy, with enough seriousness that makes you think... how ARE they going to end this?  Though we DO see the Twins in background of one scene and their \\"death scene\\" from the novel is oddly missing, while many either hate or love the Twins, they should have finished the scene or left it in.  That part really \\"redeems\\" those characters for me (still like their fight against Devastator from the previous movie...).  While the action is intense, the military does an amazing job (again!) you just can't go wrong with the third installment.  A lot of bang for your dollar here.  The plot is fleshed out, where everything makes sense.  A few twists here and there, whether they are unpredictable or very predictable.  Many salutes to various G1 references all over the movie.  As I own the BluRay version, the quality is very nice and crisp.  Everything looks as real as it did in theater digitally.  A movie I'll watch over and over.  Great movie, the 3D version is out now(still don't have it), but the BluRay standard does come with a $10 coupon good for many months for the 3D version if you want to upgrade!  I really don't want the 3D(yet), but when you buy DVD or BluRay you do expect extras, and there are none here.  That was HOW the DVD market was originally handled when DVDs were even released originally over a decade ago, and we're left with a great movie release with no extras?  I don't think so.  3.5 stars for the product, 5 stars for the movie.  They are milking it for all it's worth in an economy that's still hurting.  Parents Cautioned: Plenty of language, sexual innuedoes are much less than the previous movie, long stretches of intense action, we blow up like marshmellows apparently.

0553386794|4.0|So many people before me have loved the Song of Ice and Fire novels. A Game of Thrones is the first book in the series, written by George R.R. Martin. It follows the twisted paths of the Starks, of the Lannisters, of the Baratheon king, of the once-royal Targaryen siblings, and of the castle politics that swallow all of them. There is death and life, destruction and change, hope and fear. Often I had no idea where the plot was going, and that's what I loved most about it. It wasn't a lost blindness but rather a charge forward at full speed. Usually.<br /><br />The world itself is incredibly rich. It feels like another existence. The main setting is the Seven Kingdoms, of which Robert Baratheon rules from his castle in King's Landing. The story starts when Robert asks Eddard \\"Ned\\" Stark, his old friend and former ally against the royal \\"dragons\\" of the Targaryen line Robert deposed from the throne, to become the new Hand of the King. The former, Lord Jon Arryn, the man who was both Robert and Ned's ward when they were younger, was recently deceased. But there were suspicious circumstances. Ned wants nothing more than to stay north in his cold Winterfell, but Robert, being king, insists. His Lannister wife, Cersei, and their three children go to Winterfell to see Ned. However, the Lannisters and the Starks don't get along -- and for good reason.<br /><br />From there, the plot propels forward as Ned and his family are thrust further into the game of thrones than they cared for.<br /><br />However, the plot also follows the last surviving Targaryens, Viserys and Daenerys. They managed to escape their family's destruction. Viserys constantly plots to uproot the Usurper Baratheon from the Iron Throne. But they are far away to the east, where the barbarian Dorhtraki have the greatest power outside of the Free Cities (of which you see very little until later books, or so I'm told). Viserys sells Daenerys to Khal Drogo in exchange for the Hun-like horseman's khalasar -- fourty thousand men strong. Viserys plans to use these men to take the throne back. But all doesn't go as planned, and the perspective is from Daenerys's point of view.<br /><br />Personally, my favorite characters were the Imp -- witty dwarf Tyrion Lannister -- and Daenerys. Both seemed to have the best, most complex personalities. Daenerys in particular made me want to root for her the entire way.<br /><br />I give this novel a four out of five stars for plot and character as well as long term scope.

But all doesn't go as planned, and the perspective is from Daenerys's point of view.    Personally, my favorite characters were the Imp -- witty dwarf Tyrion Lannister -- and Daenerys. Both seemed to have the best, most complex personalities. Daenerys in particular made me want to root for her the entire way.

0061245097|5.0|OMG, \\"One Foot in the Grave\\" is dynamic. I'm not going to provide a synopsis as that has been repeatedly done by other reviewers. This book is action packed with multiple plots and unpredictable plot twists. True love is requited. Prejudices buried. Jealousy reconciled.  Assassination attempts. New age technology explored with the tried and true.  I just loved it. There was surprise after surprise. Obviously this made for a \\"can't put the book down\\" read. Chapter 32 offers one of the most deliciously inventive, passionate, thrilling, mind blowing erotic scenes ever!! Ever word was stimulatingly tantalizing. WOW Frost is scorching. This story is multi-orgasmic; it has left me reaching for the next book in the series as this reader thirsts for more which is what a series should do. Although, this book could stand alone; I highly recommend reading \\"Halfway to the Grave\\" (book 1) first.

B002PMV9FG|4.0|This is one of my favorites out of the entire series. This is also a great movie for the entire family.
B004WOJ6XC|5.0|In the month since I purchased this album I have probably listened to it over a hundred times. This album has so many different themes and awesome attributes. It takes you on a roller coaster ride of metal awesome, with some epic double bass, guitar shredding, bass solos, and more. If you are even slightly considering buying this, DO IT NOW!
B000W796OM|4.0|This is a great movie and one of my favorites out of the series. This is a great family movie, as well.
B004NSULHM|4.0|I'm typing this because I'm seeing what amounts to a whole lot of bickering from fans of the album and those that aren't. Let me start by saying that if you like the old Radiohead/Ok Computer, Kid A etc you probably will find it difficult to relate to this new album. Conceptually it is exploring a whole new realm. (for Radiohead) Here we are seeing an album constructed with loops, sound design programs and one that has a sort of minimalist feel.   Secondly. I do not understand those that say this is another eraser. Quite frankly if Thom wanted to turn a Radiohead album into something of his own efforts the band wouldn't have gone through with writing the album. If the band was not happy with the direction of the album you wouldn't be seeing 'Radiohead' on the title.   Thirdly. I have seen some reviews who have such a negative slant towards this album they deem it not to be music. I'm sorry to all of you who think this album is invalid but music is subjective as we all know and if people find this beautiful are you really going to criticize them for that?    Now I'm not trying to censor peoples opinions here I'm nearly stating that this album doesn't deserve some of the hate and contempt it's getting. If you are not happy with it please do not waste other peoples time by writing up a hate review, it is much more helpful to the potential buyer to give constructive criticism in a review, arguably.   Finally, nothing ever stays the same. Some people need to except and maybe mourn that Radiohead will probably never return to their old style. If you are unhappy with Radiohead's current direction then you are free to move on. Nothing is holding you back. For the record I'm not a dire Radiohead fan, I dislike a lot of the tracks on 'the eraser' and I dislike plenty of Radiohead songs as well. I'm simply one who deeply loves and enjoys good music.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|This is Jesse Stone's introduction to Paradise. As a lover of the Jesse Stone series, I had not seen this before. It's good and sets the stage for everything that follows. If you are a Jesse Stone fan, you'll want to see how it began.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Of course, I love and love Reign in Blood, and I always liked South of Heaven. This one is closer to the latter. I thought I was losing hope from them since Divine~~, but this one clearly shows that they know what they have been doing and will be doing. This album shouldn't be compared to some unbearable stuffs done by metallica(maybe they should consider changing their name as \\"Mental-Recall\\" because they need some total re-call of their early spirits). They finally got back from their \\"WHMSMC:we have to make songs more complicated\\" syndrome, which made their decades-old fans turn backs from them(besides it never worked). AND who cares about keeping their God as Speed-King anymore? I know and everyone else knows that they once made world-record fast album and the band is still one of the best of among speed-maniacs. I feel the Solid Ground from listening to this GOOD album, and the feeling is quite far from what I had from, like, Divine~~ God Hates~~ Christ~~. Being groovy can never be a shame, because I've always been enjoying the grooves from Angel of Death, Crooked Cross, Dead Skin Mask, Seasons in the Abyss, etc.

B003L6KNMK|5.0|I love \\"Community\\" and it signature brand of wacky, off-the-wall comedy with an eclectic cast and damn fine writing. \\"Modern Warfare\\" is their crown jewel in their series. The \\"Soup\\"'s Joel McCale joins the school's paintball competition to win the college's highly coveted 'free pass'. The mayhem that follows is a cliche-riddled, flat-out-pace, twisty 22-minutes that should've won the Emmy for best episode. Every moment is goofy & crazy mixed with a genius script of witty dialog that had me laughing from start to finish. And the ending? Sheer brilliance! Buy this episode and you won't regret it!
B004XQO90O|5.0|They say there are no new stories in Hollywood, just old stories retold.  That's pretty much the case with Source Code.  And why not?  Trying to change the past to improve the present sounds mighty appealing these days.  Anyhow, it's surprisingly fun.  The actors are likable, the pace is reasonably fast and the ending is pretty uplifting for a \\"brain in a jar\\" movie.  Originality?  I kept thinking of what happened to Captain Pike at the end of the Star Trek TV episode.  But that's ok.<br /><br />I should also mention that even on my ancient tube television the opening shots of Chicago are just friggin spectacular.  I'm guessing this has to do with the use of a Red camera about which I know little except that it's state of the art.  Either that, or the weather in Chicago has improved dramatically since when I lived there.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I remember when I was in school, from Kindergarten unto Senior year of High School, there was always a poster in the lunch rooms that featured on the banner: \\"YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT\\". Followed by the current alignment in the food pyramid.<br /><br />Today, with factory farming and Corporate food manufacturing extending even to farm crops that are chemically manipulated, radiated, in order to produce a more voluminous product for the ballooning consumer population, is it any wonder that old lunch room posters proclamation still rings true?<br /><br />We are what we eat.<br /><br />And that goes a long way to explain the cancers that plague our eliminatory organs;bowels, colon, rectum, stomach. As well as our impotence, given the byproducts that we absorb when we consume the flesh of animals that have been plumped to market beyond what nature and a decent diet would allow. Steroids, testosterone, estrogen, growth hormone, anti-biotics so as to stave off the infections factory farmed animals risk acquiring while warehoused for fattening and butchering.<br /><br />The videos of sick cows being forklift prodded toward the stun gun so they can be killed and butchered and cut into pieces so that their dead flesh can be injected with red dye and placed under plastic wrap to look fit for the table.<br /><br />Chickens, save for Purdue farms, who are fed a diet that includes their own excrement (Talk about you are what you eat!) and are also injected to be fatter, plumper, and produce a fatter bird for the price of a meal.<br /><br />Is it any wonder then that women suffer breast cancer, and reproductive organ cancers? And the number one killer of women is heart disease?<br /><br />Do we actually think byproducts of big business farming isn't going to affect us?<br /><br />We are what we eat! And we're reaping what we sew.<br /><br />This movie will wake you up so that the next trip to the grocery store, hopefully, makes for an informed consumer. And if you're fortunate enough to afford it, it could be a trip to an organic fresh foods supermarket, where free range meats, with no chemical saturation, are sold. Where free range eggs, milk, butters, cheeses, don't promise a meal with huge detrimental side effects on the menu later.<br /><br />The only reason this big farm business flourishes like this is because we the consumer keep buying into it. And for our money? We suffer and die from the ailments our organs suffer because they simply can't handle the side effects of America's present day diet and food manufacturer.<br /><br />It's worth doing the research and shopping responsibly, even if it's more expensive on the budget, than to pay the price of an affordable diet later, when the cost is far more deadly to the self than it was to the pocketbook.market, where free range meats, with no chemical saturation, are sold.

B003L77GRO|4.0|The latest season of Showtime's hit series is as engrossing and entertaining as ever, but that doesn't mean that it's perfect.  On the contrary, season five might just be the weakest of the bunch thanks to several undervwhelming plot strands, some missteps with the writing and the clear lack of an endgame on the part of the writers.  Without spoiling any plot points, let's just say that certain events are put in motion during this season that make it hard to see any sort of good outcome for our protagonist.<br /><br />And yet season five is still a must watch thanks to the lead performance of Michael C. Hall as well as the work turned in by his supporting players.  The new season also benefits from a guest starring role by Julia Stiles as a rape victim who teams up with Dexter to hunt down her assailant and his accomplices.  It is this Bonnie and Clyde-esque story arc that is the heart of these twelve episodes and as long as the show follows this trajectory, it is as as riveting ever.  Unfortunately too much time is spent on plot lines that don't go anywhere or are not fully integrated into the narrative.  You can almost feel the series spinning its wheels as a murderous drug cartel is investigated or when Angel and LaGuerta let work interfere with their marriage (who saw that coming?).  Sometimes the plot lines are intriguing but left largely untapped.  The most glaring example of this is the manner in which the kids are sent away to stay with their grandparents following Rita's death.  What a rich area this would have been to explore in terms of watching Dexter deal with single parenthood, grieving children and his dark passenger.  Alas, the kids are out of the picture which makes it much easier for him to tend to business.<br /><br />It may sound like I'm being hard on season 5, but it is really another strong installment for the popular and acclaimed series.  Peter Weller and Johnny Lee Miller help elevate things to another level with their memorable guest performances.  When all is said and done, Dexter makes it through yet another blood soaked season.  But I can't help but be reminded of the words of Jordan Chase (Miller):  \\"Tick, tick, tick....that's the sound of your life running out\\".  The clock is quickly expiring on Dexter and his dark passenger.  If the show's creators don't capitalize on that, this classic runs the very real risk of overstaying its welcome and fading from potent drama to preposterous comedy.  That would be a horrible fate for such a fine series.all is said and done, Dexter makes it through yet another blood soaked season.

044024367X|3.0|Ex-military MP, Jack Reacher decides to live his life encumbered by belongings. He doesn't want to live in one place, doesn't want to own anything but the clothes on his back and travels whereever he pleases, stays a long as he wants and moves on. Or so he thought when he decided one day to walk across the country from Maine to California. With just his passport, his ATM card and some cash in his pocket, he passes through the town of Hope and crosses into the town of Despair. The name of the town itself should have given him pause for thought but then Jack doesn't like turning back, so he walks on ... and finds himself in a strange and hostile town that doesn't welcome strangers. In a span of minutes, he manages to punch a deputy sheriff, gets himself arrested for vagrancy, jailed for the night, appears before a judge and is unceremoniously informed he is not welcome in the town of Despair and is driven back to Hope with firm instructions not to return.....ever!    Now if ever there was a challenge, that's one for Jack. He needs to know what the town of Despair is hiding that they need to keep throwing people out of their town. With the reluctant help of a Hope policewoman, Jack starts to discover some very strange goings-on indeed in Despair, after he stumbles over a dead body in the dark, and a plane that flies in and out of a metal plant every night.    In typical Jack Reacher fashion, his tenaciousness uncovers military secrets, bullies he gets to beat up, people he tries to help and odd mysteries to solve.  Not as exciting as others in the Reacher series.
0807014273|5.0|I'd heard Man's Search for Meaning and author Viktor Frankl referenced many times over the past few years.  I decided in 2010 to finally read this.  Was I glad I did.  It is by far one of the most riveting stories of the power of the human mind and spirit.  I've since re-read this 2 more times in the past 12 months.<br /><br />His theory that there are only 2 \\"races\\" of men on earth is intriguing.  He asserts there are only \\"decent\\" men and \\"indecent\\" men.  He states every society has both.  The thought that there were \\"decent\\" Nazi guards in the camps and likewise \\"indecent\\" prisoners is interesting and he brings the point home so very well.<br /><br />I believe this book has been deemed, by the Library of Congress, one of the 10 most influential books ever written.  You owe it to yourself to check it out.
B000P5FH3K|2.0|By the time this 2:15 movie is over, I was fidgeting in my shoes because it just seems to drag on without end. Where was the editing? This needed a 30 minute haircut, especially the pedestrian courtroom scenes where absolutely no surprises happen to justify the tedium. Francis Ford Coppola was once a titan, but by 1997 when this bloat job was made, his talent had vanished. I did enjoy some of the acting, especially Jon Voight's shark lawyer. Matt Damon, then unknown, is okay, but not special here. He would do much more with the same-time-frame \\"Good Will Hunting.\\" The plot is standard courtroom fare, and all the characters are stereotypes, including the battered wife, the rumpled clown (Danny DeVito), the wise judge (Danny Glover) and the hard-luck family that wins over the cold hearted insurance company in the end. This movie is the film equivalent of the novel on which it is based: pop junk food.

B000LC55F2|4.0|The sign of a great movie is when you want to see it over again.  And this one fits the bill.  The only issue is that you feel like you may have missed something, like Michael Cane says, which requires you to see it again.  But watching it a second time only reinforces what a brilliant piece of writing and directing this is.  Top 10 for sure.
0307477479|1.0|Pulitzer Prize? Seriously?  If I were grading this in a creative writing class I would give it a C.  The chapters supposedly from different POV's all sound like the same person whether first or third.  I do not care about any of them--and the little power point at the end--well just another flim flam ploy.  I have read books that have no blurbs and no hype that are far more entertaining, not to mention better written.   I would not recommend this book to anyone and I am angry at myself for spending the money.

I asked them to read it and both came back raving about the concepts introduced in this great read.<br /><br />The authors have a way of taking the complicated and making it easy to comprehend and better yet, implement within your organization.  Grasping these concepts have helped my companies move through a challenging economic cycle and out perform our competitors in a HUGE way.

0345529057|5.0|This is for the 4 set of books, not the Kindle version. I've had no issue with mine. No missing pages, no out of order pages. I'm almost to the finish of book four and the books have held up quite well being carried around, tossed in bags and purses over the past couple of months.    As to the story, I've enjoyed it. I will say that this is a book by an adult for adults. I would suggest if anyone wants their teenager to read it that the parents read it first since there is a lot of violence, torture, mentions of rape and some not really explicit sex scenes (as in descriptions without going into the whole 'tab A into slot B' detail), not to mention adult language. The HBO mini series is rated R for a reason, and the books are just as much, so bear this in mind if you're squeamish or if you're getting this for kids.) Characters live, characters die.  It's an adult read just as the HBO show is an adult show.    YMMV on its appropriateness of course, so read for yourself and make your own decision.    It is very reminiscent of Lord of the Rings....but there is no singular 'good guy' and no singular 'bad guy'....pretty much all the characters take turns having highs and lows.    So, for me, good product, good book, good story. For the equivalent of $5 each, I have my money's worth.

SIMPLE!!!!    2. These reviews that people are posting here are for this product even though its not released yet because we know from Georges own site what they are being released with and that is NO ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSIONS. Once again its simple, release originals with your changed versions.    3. I give this one star because George should release the Original Theatrical versions in the best quality available on this Blu Ray set, its simple, JUST RELEASE IT THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSIONS!!!!!

B000SEH13C|5.0|Back when I was in high school and college (shortly after the dinosaurs died off) Kurt Vonnegut was probably the most read author among my peers, followed closely by J.R.R. Tolkein and Hermann Hesse. Of these three, Hesse's novels addressed the spiritual restlessness of the 1960s, Tolkein was like a few hits off a bong that allowed the reader to experience an entirely different world, and Vonnegut, well he was the one who best expressed the frustration and lack of faith in our leaders and government.    Vonnegut, followed closely by Mark Twain, was the greatest satirist this country ever produced. He took on all the topics of the day with a wit that was as sharp as a rapier's edge. He had the ability to make you laugh and squirm at the same time. His passing a few years ago left a void in American literature. (\\"So it goes,\\" to quote another of his books.)    Cat's Cradle is one of a handful of Vonnegut's books that rank among the best of 20th century literature. Re-reading it after a couple of decades is to immerse oneself again into a familar stream. I'm glad I had the chance to read Cat's Cradle years ago. To read it for the first time now, in the post-9/11, post Cold War era, must seem a bit daunting. Without the background of living through a time when nuclear missiles were poised to reign down annihilation on mankind, some of Vonnegut's bitter humor is lost. Put it remains a powerful voice.    In a mere 300 pages and 100+ very short chapters, Vonnegut manages to construct a novel that pulls together the threads of a uniquely dysfunctional family, an outlawed religion, a banana republic dictatorship on a small Carribean island, a secretly created substance that can destroy the world, and ... well, so much more that you wonder how he will ever pull it off without unraveling all the various threads. Somehow he does it and, in the process, turns those threads into a tapestry of human folly. That's the true genius of Vonnegut. That his unique voice and vision will still be around a century from now seems inevitable!
B004J4WL50|5.0|This very readable book is not just for those venturing into business for the first time, but for anyone who wishes to make a difference in their personal life.  Blake offers three questions that I am still thinking about: \\"If you did not have to worry about money, what would you do with time?  What kind of work you want to do?  What cause would you serve?\\"  I do not intend to start a business, but these questions are forcing me to think about what I do with my personal time and what causes I wish to support.
1591791707|5.0|I love this book on cd.  You can listen to the disk that speaks to your needs and stop and absorb as you progress.  Marshall Rosenberg has a unique way of speaking slowly enough and plain enough so you can understand and really take in the messages of feeling and thinking with compassion and empathy.  I recommend this book on cd to everyone.  Think what a great place this planet would be if we were to all embrace and practice living through compassion and empathy towards all things.  Our society really needs this quiet and thoughtful way of being right now.  After listening to these cds I was unable to watch my previously favorite tv shows because I no longer wanted to hear and see all the violence and over the top sexual content and sordid language.  Who would have thought a book could change me so much!
0061729078|3.0|The essay The Doors of Perception is quite a fascinating read. Huxley does an excellent job conveying his mystical experience and inspiring his readers. For the most part, this essay is written very well and one can easily understand the widespread interest in it. But I wouldn't say this essay is quite that meaningful to people who are not interested in psychedelics or mystical religious practices.     The second essay, Heaven and Hell, is beyond mostly unintelligible to me. Sure, I could have researched the host of obscure and more well-know artists and art works that he mentions, but I had no care to. This essay is heavily laden with art history to get remotely-related points across about psychedelics and the significance of mystical religious practices. Some have mentioned this essay is more difficult to read, in comparison to the other main essay of this book, and that certain sections if not the whole essay need repeated read throughs. But I had absolutely no desire to read this dated, uninteresting, lofty, material. But I got through it, without much taken from it.     There is an included essay, Drugs that Shape Men's lives, and I would say this essay, and The Doors of Perception, are both very great essays if one is interested in the subject matter. They are probably worth the purchase of the book. I don't regret purchasing it, overall.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|First off I love this knife! But if you're not familiar with survival knives be prepared this thing is thick! Also it kind of reminds me of a kitchen knife, but if you feel like you want something hefty and will last a long time than this is the knife for you.

0451232577|3.0|Just finished reading the book. Well...I must say I expected a bit more from Ken...way more.   After reading The Pillars and The World Without End you kind of expect nothing less but greatnessfrom a giant like Ken .   I like history books. I like the era. I like the characters but I do not like the overall feel of the book. It is obvious he put a lot of effort and investigation in it. It looks to me he wanted to show it. There's waaay too much explanation of what is happening on political scene and why were the big nations doing what they were doing. Totally unnecessary (and boring oftentimes). I lost my self in that too many times just yearning for the characters to interact. Mister Follet is at his best when he describes the lives of his characters. Unfortunately he is not doing enough of this. The story was hijacked by the history itself.   This could have been a fantastic read, but it is not. Hopefully he'll make adjustments in the next volume and treat us with the story instead of the mediocre history manual.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|'Modern Family' is quite possibly the finest program on television today.  The show is nicely shot for a sitcom with single-camera photography (ala Curb Your Enthusiasm, 30 Rock, and The West Wing). The two or three different subplots nearly always come together in the end in a surprising and clever way.  Ample time is given to each of the characters over the course of the season so that they can be fully realized. The entire cast also has the chops to add the required depth to these characters (especially Rico Rodriguez, Eric Stonestreet, and Sofia Vergara). The show tempers its depth with the occasional (and welcome) low-brow joke. But it almost always ends with a positive, practical reflection on family life and how preferable it is to the alternative.
1439152780|3.0|Yes, Morton can write, but this one was trite. Definitely her weakest effort. I don't want to give anything away, but the \\"surprising\\" plot twists were utterly predictable. And at least one piece of the plot was a shameless rip-off of DuMaurier. Frankly, I don't regret reading it, but it could have been so much more compelling if Morton strayed from the formula a bit. Truth is, I would have preferred \\"The True History of the Mudman\\" -- if it actually was a book. Alas, it isn't.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers follows the path an exploits of a few specific American soldiers and companies in the course of their service in Europe in World War 2.   Put simply, it's brilliant. It's written based on the first-hand account of several of the veterans whose stories it tells, and the veterans themselves appear briefly in the episodes to describe characters and events in each episode in their own words. The acting is excellent, the filming is excellent, and the historical perspective is truly unique in anything I've ever seen.    I can't think of a time where I've been so uniformly impressed with a show or miniseries, five out of five.    A note on this boxed set, it comes in a steel case (that has now had a very rough life being carried around a ranch and has protected its contents flawlessly) and is both sturdy and compact. The disks themselves are fitted well, unlike many current DVD boxes, and so they don't rattle around the box every time you pick it up.
B002ZG999U|1.0|This movie sucked. I wished I had never watched it. I wanted to like it, but it was so lame.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|Hello enjoyed the old Ed Sullivan show's. They  really took be back to the sixties. The Beatles rocking out. That was great to see again. The entertainment was so simple back then. I really enjoyed going back, and remembering my memories back then. Very good certainly much differant than today's entertainment. Really enjoyed it.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Like many others I pre-ordered this the first day it was available on Amazon.  Months later, when I found out the original, unaltered versions would not be included, I did not immediately cancel.  Disappointing, sure, but not unexpected after all.  I still had my 2008 non-anamorphic widescreen DVD versions which I bought for $22 on Amazon a year ago (sorry, now apparently OOP).  I still really wanted to see the films in 1080p.    When I saw video of Vader bellowing \\"NOOOOOOOOO\\" when he throws the Emperor at the end of RotJ, then saw confirmation it was really real, I cancelled my pre-order immediately.  At this point I'm half disgusted and half amused by the way Star Wars has been treated on home video.  They know exactly how the die-hard fans are going to react.  This is an intentional \\"Screw You\\", and frankly it's hilarious.  Doing this over and over again and watching the fan's heads explode every time, it really is pretty humorous, isn't it?    I'm not even mad.  I know in my lifetime, maybe not until after George Lucas dies (thank God I am much younger than him), but someday I will own a pristine, high definition copy of the original trilogy with Han shooting first, no Jabba in Mos Eisley, no Ghost of Young Anakin Skywalker, no Vader yelling \\"NOOOOOOOOO\\", no corny CGI creatures bouncing around every establishing shot, no New Emperor face, no blinking Ewoks, etc.  It will happen when they have completely exhausted the fan-base and wrung every possible dollar they can get out of re-releases in the latest format that are just shy of what we really want.  It has to happen and it will happen.  That's just Capitalism, folks!    So don't get mad, just save your money and wait it out.  The sooner sales dry up the sooner we will get what we really want.  If you keep buying just because it's Star Wars and \\"oh, well it's good enough\\", it will just take longer.  I can wait and so can you.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Might be the greatest app in the history of the world - but I'll never know, since it won't play my Cloud-stored purchases from Amazon and won't update.  It just continually tells me there's  an update - which is at least one version back, it's saying 2.0.4 - but refuses to either open or update.  It just stays locked on &quot;Starting download&quot;, without ACTUALLY downloading.  So I can't play the music I just bought.  Amazon, sometimes you really SUCK.
0756405890|5.0|This has to be; No! Is! the best book I've ever read. It has everything from magic, to drama, to action! This is a great series and from the start you do not want to put the book down. This book isn't just for the nerdy Lord of the Rings type or Dungeons and Dragons (like me), This book is for everyone who enjoys brilliant writing.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|The American is a superb movie.  I came to Amazon as is my habit, to read reviews before watching this movie and noticed almost twice as many one star reviews as five star.  I had nearly decided not to watch it.  Then I thought since I had it recorded, I may as well have a look.  Let me tell you, I am so glad that I took that look.  I found it excellent from beginning to end.  It never dragged, it wasn't slow.  Like another reviewer stated, it stays with you... even after it is over.  It probably isn't for everyone (what is?), but I was not disappointed at all and I'm not even a Clooney fan...well, I wasn't.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Thankfully, watching the show made it much easier to follow the vast number of characters, places and descriptions.  I had never read any fantasy novels before and I'm very glad to have ventured into the genre with such a great book.  I'm looking forward to reading other books in this genre along with continuing on with this series.

The cinematography is incredible, the soundtrack goes along perfectly, and the commentating is great.    Even if you aren't an avid snowboarder you should check this film out.  I've had at least 3 people watch it with me who weren't riders and they were stunned.    Pros:      Everything    Cons:    Wish it was longer.  I honestly could've watched this film if it was 4 hours long.  It was that good.
B0034G4ORM|1.0|I hope J&oacute;hann J&oacute;hannsson made a good chunk of change to have his music used in the first mesmerizing teaser that lured so many to see this sure-fire Razzie contender.  We been had.<br /><br />Who did these people have sex with to get this made?  This is Mystery Science Theater 3000 stuff; as much as the similarly-named Battle of Los Angeles that Netflix keeps trying to trick you to rent.  Note: the true measure of the badness here is not the special effects or the production budget.<br /><br />Throw out everything good about the genre.  Keep all the clich&eacute;s.  Employ a producer, director, and/or writer whose main hobby has to be playing Call of Duty and who's been robbed the patience they were born with for not only reading books, but just watching entire cut-scenes or intros at the beginning of their video games, because they just gotta go blow some stuff up quick.  Add some really overzealous lighting techs who want to bath everything in solid \\"motif\\" colors.  That's Battle: Los Angeles.  Heck, I would bet the writing in Call of Duty is better than this stinker.  The dialog is so terrible you just have to see it for yourself to believe.  The news people, scientists, and officials talk like a(n) (possibly aforementioned?) pre-teen wrote the lines.  How on Earth (no pun intended) does this even pass the test audiences?  Is Facebook causing brain damage?  Quick, they're after our water!!!  Cuz, yeah, you know... it's like liquid and stuff.  After seeing this steaming turd, I don't blame the CGI people who worked on it for going off and doing the still mediocre Skyline.  I can see how, in spite of that film's SERIOUS problems, it's still bafflingly superior and they actually did have better ideas that the B:LA 'tards had no interest in using.  They still made the odd repeat misjudgment of opening the film with yet another unnecessary foreshadowing of a cinematic money-shot (take a tip from the porn industry).<br /><br />As \\"Hollywood\\" and jazzed-up and pop-cultured (think of a petri dish of infectious mimetic waste) and all around happy-fun-timed Independence Day is, that's practically Oscar-caliber compared to this.

And aside from its last act... correction, aside from Tim Robbins onward (love the guy, hated that casting and how it totally lost its cathartic way after this point), Spielberg's War of the Worlds gave a decent high-drama post-modern, neo-realist whateva-you-wanna-call-it retake on the H.G. Wells concept.  Copped-out on the ending, but it's a Spielberg, after all.  B:LA practically rapes Aliens, Blackhawk Down, District 9, Independence Day, Terminator Salvation, and even first person shooters... it rapes and pillages their content and yells \\"HOORAH!\\" and says \\"Master Sergeant!\\" incessantly at every available opportunity until you get to the end and go, \\"dude, where's Dude Where's My Car?\\"  Could B:LA possibly be a worse film?  Not to mention you're left hoping real marines are not this annoying, otherwise it's Please, please find a war and a beach you can send them to get blown up on.  Fast.

That has to be some kind of travesty.<br /><br />I could write and direct a better movie than this with half my brain tied behind my back.  Hit me with a bat so I can prove it.  No, give me the bat.

B0007MWZEK|4.0|I bought the cordless Swivel Sweeper after seeing a great buy in a local retail flyer and reading reviews on Amazon.Com. The first day I used the sweeper I loved it. It is a little noisy but not terrible. The second day I used it I was not as impressed. I am not sure if the battery was completely charged even though I charged it overnight. The instructions say to charge it AT LEAST 8 HRS. I Charged it over 12. Maybe I over charged it? Who knows.    Like I said, I bought the sweeper because the price was right and because in our apartment we have laminate flooring and area rugs, so I do not need a regular vacuum. Most of the dirt is swept up with a broom and dust pan. For those reasons, the sweeper works great for me. Also, I noticed it works better on my area rug than my laminate flooring.     I read tons of reviews before purchasing the Swivel Sweeper. My advice us to try it for yourself. You can always return it if you don't like it.

0307887898|3.0|Currently, there is increasing interest in entrepreneurship.  Whether this interest is driven by the current economic climate or frustration with working in corporate America, matters not.  What does matter is that small business, not large corporations, are credited with being the engine of job creation.  And what we need today is jobs.    Unfortunately, most start-ups fail.  How much better off would we be as a society or nation if more start-up entrepreneurs succeeded?  The author of The Lean StartUp, Eric Ries, believes that entrepreneur failure can be prevented.  To accomplish this, Ries puts forth his Lean StartUp model.    Reading this book was an interesting experience.  The first several chapters engaged me and created the desire to read me.  These chapters were the Vision section of the book.  As I moved into the Steer section of the book, I found my enthusiasm and interest waning.  I fear that had I not agreed to review the book for the Amazon Vine Program, I probably would have set the book aside.  I found this section tough going.  I had to slog through it.      While the author recommends the book be read chapter by chapter, I disagree.  I would recommend instead that the reader start with Part One, the Vision, and then jump to Chapter 13, the Epilogue.  My thinking is that this will help the reader from getting bogged down in the details of the Lean StartUp model found in Part Two.    The Lean StartUp model is based on the author's belief that start-up success can be engineered by following the right process - a process that can be learned.  Based on his successful experiences as both an entrepreneur and entrepreneurial consultant, The Lean StartUp model builds on lean manufacturing, design thinking, customer development and agile development.  Lean StartUp is about how to achieve continuous innovation through the application of lean thinking to the process of innovation.      The five principles of Lean StartUp are:  1. Entrepreneurs are everywhere2. Entrepreneurship is management  3. Validated learning  4. Build-Measure-Learn  5. Innovation accounting    I agreed to review The Lean StartUp as I am a budding entrepreneur and thought the book would be personally helpful to me.  I believe it was, despite my getting bogged down in the details of the Lean StartUp model.  As a budding entrepreneur, I found the sections on validated learning, build-measure-learn and innovation accounting to be particularly helpful and valuable.  They will no doubt influence my development, and hopefully success, as an entrepreneur.      If you are an entrepreneur or, like me, a budding entrepreneur, you should read this book.  It just might save you considerable time, energy and resources.
B004ULNJF8|4.0|I consider myself a Jason Statham connoisseur.  I enjoy most of the movies he's been in with the exception of \\"Revolver\\" which I found to be too darn bizarre (I understand the movie, but it was executed all wrong by Guy Ritchie).      Based on the negative reviews here on Amazon I dived into this movie expecting the worst and instead I was pleasantly surprised by how great this movie was for being a relatively low budget UK import that skipped theaters here in the States.  I'll get this out of the way: This movie doesn't have the non stop action of a Transporter or Expendables flick.  That's not to say there's no action or that's boring (it's not), but it doesn't have the over the top choreographed action that are a staple of many of his movies.  However, Statham is still a bad ass mo-fo in this flick.  He's a pissed off cop with his hands tied behind his back because he's under media scrutiny after using force against bad guys while off duty.  Because the movie attempts to stay somewhat grounded in reality it would be silly for his character to be fighting ten guys at a time, getting into unnecessary shootouts, car chases and blowing up buildings.  Statham does kick ass when appropriate and it is always appropriate and satisfying.  Statham's character isn't up against a gang of mercenaries or the Chinese army, he's pursuing one maniac, thus the \\"lack of action\\".    Also, the bad guy in to movie was Tommy Carcetti in \\"The Wire\\" and is Petyr Baelish in \\"Game of Thrones\\".  So not only do you get Statham playing a restrained badass, you get the mayor from The Wire!!  And he's F'ing crazy in this movie!  How could you not appreciate that?    If you don't at least somewhat like this movie you were raised by over protective parents and still suck your thumb when you go to bed at night.    I'm out!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I first watched this movie simply because I love to watch any movie at least once that has Christmas as its setting. This one, however, is good all year long. I didn't even realize that it had four, yes four!, of my favorite actors. I knew that any movie with Cameron Diaz and Jack Black would have great humor (which it does), and Kate Winslet and Jude Law would be icing on the cake.<br /><br />It's a romantic comedy in which all four main characters are having issues with love and/or commitment. The sets are great; Amanda's (Cameron Diaz) beautiful upscale home in Los Angeles and Iris' (Kate Winslet) cozy winter cottage in rural England. They swap houses for the holidays and find more than they were looking for; love, friendship, learning what is really important in life. Some of it is predictable, but there are a few surprises.<br /><br />This movie will have you laughing most of the time, choking up on occasion. You'll want to have this one in your collection for those times when you want to watch a feel-good movie with a good ending.
B002NXPTDK|5.0|I heard this album a long time before i actually started to like it, mostly beacuse I'm a hip hop head. Not an underground junkie or a mainstream slave...I'm a hip hop head. And when i heard this album i seriously had no clue what to think. Well actually i thought it was a bunch of bs just singin not enough Rap for me. But the more i heard the songs unwillingly (my cousins cudi on a daily basis) the more I felt a change of heart for this abstract album. I'm pretty sure that this album and BOB's (sorry don't care enough about that fools music to want to spell his name right) album came out the same time and so i prolly heard them at around the same time and 3 years later let me tell you this.....BOB is a puppet (he used to make good music but turned in his mic just so a bunch of teenage girls would like him) and Cudi is the start of something revoluotionary. Defintly not hip hop (but pays his respects on songs like Hyyerr,Simple As.., and Soundtrack 2 my life) but almost a new type of music. I would say Pop art but really I have no clue what that means, but my guess is that it is popular music that is truly a piece of art and guess then it's a perfect fit. I love this album but totally understand why some people won't but to me is one of the best albums of recent MUSIC. SO check it out if you are ready for a revolution in mainstream music.
0470901071|4.0|This is a good study guide, it prepared me for the test very well and i didn't even do any of the labs or take more than a few of the numerous tests. The subject matter matches up well with the current test and i feel that it was better than the 31 days Before Your CCNA Exam by Allan Johnson, which did not prepare me enough to pass the test. My only criticism is all the extraneous information that is in the guide that is not test subject matter... but still, good guide.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Supernatural Season 5 was Eric Kripke's last season at the helm...Sera Gamble stepped up to direct season 6;  After watching the whole season, you can definitely sense Eric saying goodbye--especially in the finale.  I'm so glad the show didn't end, though!  I LOVE season 5--I won't do any spoilers, but if you are even a lukewarm fan of the show, you will enjoy this season; and if you're a loyal, from-the-beginning fan like me, it's one of the show's best (behind seasons 1 & 3).

B004HO6HWA|5.0|Whether you are a Jason Stratham fan or just an action junkie, this is a fantastic movie. For a hit man to stay alive obviously he must use his wits and know what he's doing and Stratham plays this one all out. Stratham plays this hit man as you expect one to be: brooding and secretive yet totally aware of everything that goes on around him. Past movies like Death Race showed the same drive, but this one is his best ever. Good writing, and even good acting make this one great from beginning to end. At just over 90 minutes, I wanted it to go on....

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I am a HUGE Star Wars fan which is why i'm not buying these altered films where Greedo shoots first and Han steps on Jabba's tail and the Max Rebo band is jamming to \\"Jedi Rocks\\" ... etc.. why can't lucas just make his money off of all the suckers for a year and then give Criterion access to the film and put out the version of these films that real fans have loved and people who weren't able to see them in 35mm film, can at least check them out in Hi Definition quality.... in the past Steven Sansweet, speaking for Lucas, said that the original cuts of the films would never make it to dvd, a few years later they did arrive (although they made sure to put them out in poor quality, and non-anamorphic) so there is hope, ESPECIALLY IF ENOUGH PEOPLE SPEAK UP AND BOYCOTT THIS FILM.

B005BJ7XUU|4.0|Every artist has that one album they've always wanted to do. In the case of Lenny Kravitz, it's his long overdue funk album. An album that he has talked about since the late 90's, but never actually got around to doing- until now. He almost released a first version of the album in 2004, but that record became the spiritual themed \\"Baptism\\". Enter \\"Black And White America\\"- his first album for the hard rock label Roadrunner Records after a 20 year courtship with Virgin Records. The record- which was originally titled \\"Negrophilia\\"- was mostly inspired by Lenny being a product of interracial marriage and watching a documentary on racism in the age of President Barack Obama. Those two things became the catalyst for his new album in three years. Although this was billed as his \\"funk album\\", up until this point the funkiest Kravitz actually got was in 1998 on his highest selling recording to date \\"5\\". On \\"Black And White America\\", he shows that he can get down as well as rock and roll.<br /><br />Anyone expecting a lot of social commentary due to the title should know that it starts and ends with the title track \\"Black And White America\\"- a song in which he describes growing up of mixed heritage. The song \\"In The Black\\" has a merging of rock and disco (Think: Kiss' \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\"). He channels the vibe of a couple of R&B and funk legends- such as Rick James on the sexually charged \\"Come On Get It\\", Marvin Gaye on \\"Liquid Jesus\\" and Earth, Wind & Fire on \\"Life Ain't Ever Been Better Than It Is Now\\". He duets with a couple of rappers on this album, like Drake on the synth heavy \\"Sunflower\\" and collaborating with Jay-Z for the third time on the dancehall inspired \\"Boongie Drop\\". Though he dabbles in funk for most of the recording, he still has his rock numbers, like the songs \\"Rock Star City Life\\", the uptempo \\"Everything\\", and the first single \\"Stand\\". He brings it all home with the arena rocker \\"I Can't Be Without You\\" as well as the ballad \\"Looking Back On Love\\". He sings of peace on the piano driven ballads \\"The Faith Of A Child\\" as well as \\"Dream\\" and closes the album with the inspirational track \\"Push\\". It's been a long time coming, but Lenny Kravitz's \\"Black And White America\\" is a great record, and one where Lenny's simplistic songwriting actually works in his favor this time around. It's a record that one will be completely surprised that they didn't know that he had it in him.ove\\".

0307946711|5.0|I agreed to read One Day (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage Contemporaries) for a book club selection. I was a bit leary of the choice based on the cover and the first few pages. However, the book began to grab me and I was deeply in its clutches by page 25. I found it to be mesmerizing, well-written and a great page-turner. There are a lot of points for discussion and this is a book that can be a 'beach book' or a literary delight. It was both for me.<br /><br />The novel centers around two young adults in London - Dexter and Emma. They meet on the day of their college graduation - July 15, 1988 and spend some intimate time together. The book travels with them through time, coming back to visit them on July 15th of every year throgh 2007. We get to know each of them very well and root for their successes while pining for their failures and mistakes. Emma is deeply in love with Dexter but the timing almost always seems to be wrong. He is a party guy well into the 90's, getting well-known in his career on late-night television, along with his womanizing, drinking and drugging. Emma teaches school but her great ambition is to write. She are Dexter are like ships passing in thei night. They are best friends but the time is never right for them to partner up with one another. They spend hours on the phone together and share their lives but 'best friends' is not enough for Emma. Emma enters into some futile affairs, as does Dexter. It seems like they will never see the light and settle down with one another.<br /><br />The book is very literate and character-driven. The author is astute, perspicacious about the ins and outs of personalities, and knows what makes people tick. I just loved this book and could not put it down. I recommend it to anyone who loves reading literate love stories and intelligent page-turners. This is a book not to be missed.
B003L77G38|5.0|I got into Fringe halfway through the first season and since then I have been hooked. I've read some great reviews and don't intend to write the same things that others have so I'll just explain why this show is so appealing to me. I rarely watch tv anymore because everything is so predictable. Most shows have a crime that needs to be solved and within the next 30-45 minutes it is solved. Wash, rinse, repeat. Fringe is a new kind of show that has some of the best writing and story elements of any show out there. It's fun to go back to the first season and find all the things you miss the first time around. Some episodes are great as a stand alone story but most of the episodes move the story forward inch by inch. Just when you think you have the answer, they change the question. The characters are very likable. Fringe is the only show that I feel as if by watching it I actually get smarter. Brilliant show! The Blu-ray looks great and has enough extras to keep the disk in your Blu-ray player after all the episodes are done. If you're reading this you are most likely a fan of Fringe already as it has a very loyal fan base. I hope that enough people watch the next season. This is a show that should end on its own, not by the \\"Observers\\" at Fox.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Like the motorists in the story, the reader would do well to just keep trucking rather than stop in at \\"Mile 81.\\" Now, it's easy to be mean and cutting, especially to a mega-millionaire, but I don't want to do that. I like King a lot, I'll always read his stories. And it's hard to say why I didn't like this one, because it has the form and style that King always has. An unexplained phenomena terrorizes a small town, and common and flawed individuals are called to deal with it.<br /><br />The best I can say is that it just didn't work. It's King doing what he always does, but it just falls flat. There isn't much of a chance for you to develop an attachment to any characters, so the  horror doesn't work because it's inexplicable violence happening to characters we don't care that much about. \\"Mailing it in\\" in an apt phrase. It's tough because a bird's-eye view of the story reveals typical King, but it's in the particulars that the story disappoints. The characterizations are ho-hum and there are no stakes. The other-wordly evil is too much so, and that takes you out of the story when he's trying to draw you in. King frequently relies on a necessary suspension of disbelief in the reader, and there's nothing wrong with that, but if you don't do it right you won't earn that from the reader.<br /><br />People read for entertainment value, and they also read for insight. I think King falls even shorter with \\"Mile 81\\" on this level. It plays on a ubiquitous King theme, that children know better than adults, but, like everything else, it just wasn't resonating this time. Besides that, it's such a shop-worn trope in our culture--that youth possesses more wisdom than the aged--how many more times do we need to hear it?

0553386794|4.0|Martin's entire world with the exceptional personalities and the storyline are great - as well as possible. Almost everything comes about for a good reason, and absolutely nothing is easy. There's no doubt that Martin has discovered an outstanding equilibrium concerning the sophisticated but plodding Lord of the Rings not to mention Robert Jordan's fun however , childish Wheel of Time. A bit of magic as well as creatures supply this world color even so the drama can be quite very human; for a short time I thought about whether or not this was actually a fantasy novel or perhaps if the characters' individual references to the paranormal had been basically their very own superstition. Game of Thrones isn't a complete work in in addition to itself and many types of the most important story lines are eventually left unresolved, several in a condition of substantial pressure. However at the very least so far the tale unfolds with a determined clip and then there isn't much filler. Most of the heroes are incredibly strong and I am told that over the course of the collection they modify as well as develop and push the audience to reconsider.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|For a lot of people like me who live in the Deep South, this movie has become a cherished cultural gem since it was released ten years ago.  Not only is it one of the funniest movies the Coen Brothers have ever released, it seems like every man, woman, and child south of the Mason Dixon is issued a copy of the soundtrack at birth.    This movie has begged for a BluRay release since the inception of the format.  It was one of the first movies to be given digital color correction in post production, which gives the movie a sepia toned look reminiscent of photos you'd find taken in the era.  There are a ton of wide shots that feature a late summer landscape of Mississippi, which are going to look awesome in high definition.    It usually doesn't make a whole lot of sense to spend a few bucks extra for a BluRay of a comedy movie, but this is one exception where it's absolutely worth it.  The only downside about this BluRay is that it's taken so long for it to be released in the first place.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is a Science-Fiction film that takes place mostly in space. This movie is an exciting tale of a captain, his crew, and a young seemingly-crazy girl who make their living as thieves. The captain, Mal, has taken the girl and her brother onto his ship. The siblings, Simon and River, are on the run from the Alliance, the government of the galaxy. Simon broke River out of an Alliance laboratory, where they were doing studies on her, and they have been hiding since. Simon, thinking that Serenity is no longer a safe place to keep River, decides to part ways with Mal and his crew until River has a psychotic episode that exposes her whereabouts to the Alliance.    Serenity started out a Science-Fiction television series called Firefly that didn't last very long. After the show was canceled it was decided there would be a movie to wrap up the loose ends of the story. Nathan Fillion plays Mal, the veteran captain trying to make a living after the end of the war. Summer Glau plays River. Adam Baldwin plays Jayne, a shoot-first-ask-later member of Mal's crew and a source for most of the humor in the film. These actors aren't exactly red carpet stars. However, they put together they made a great movie.   This movie has everything. There is every type of romance, the budding love between the ship's mechanic and Simon, the mature love between Mal's first mate and the ship's pilot, and the estranged love of Mal and Inara, a teacher in a girl's house. The film is filled with action. There are numerous battle scenes with many enemies. The crew is forced to fight off Reavers, cannibals and rapists who float out in space and send raiding parties to nearby planets, during a heist. The Alliance sends an assassin, armed with a samurai sword, after River and Mal fights him more than once. There is also humor. This movie has many funny parts, mostly due to Jayne's snide comments such as the one made during the climactic battle scene. The first mate asks, \\"Do you really think any ofus will make it out of this alive?\\" Jayne pauses for a moment as he looks at the rest of the crew, then replies, \\"Well, I might.\\"   There are truly, very few negatives to this film. Although the movie is a cheesy Sci-Fi flick the storyline is fantastic and intriguing. The actors are mostly unknowns, but they play their parts spectacularly. The special effects were even fairly well done for when the movie was made. There's very little I would change about this film, if anything at all.   This is an excellent movie for Sci-Fi buffs, but not only them. I have never really been interested in Science-Fiction space movies but I enjoyed this movie immensely.  I recommend this movie for those who enjoy films like Star Wars and Star Trek. However, I also recommend Serenity for those who are looking for a movie that's a little out of the ordinary, but has a great storyline.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I always thought they were on the right track with presenting the X Men on film. This does not include the Wolverine movie. I think Jackman has the character down but that movie was meh at best. This one nails it. It is not only out of continuity with the other movies and comics but seems to start things on its own. It is kind of like the JJ Abrams Star Trek. It is new and exciting. Thee characters are grey and that is always the way to go. It is interesting to see how factions begin and develop. The Wolverine cameo is there and is the best laugh in an otherwise serious affair. The idea of linking the start of the mutant revolution with the Cuban missile crisis is great. Just buy it and see for yourself. It sits right up there with the best of the modern comic book movies.

0061148512|3.0|**This contains spoilers**<br /><br />I read this book, finally, after it being recommended as a must-read from several people. We're pretty good about not spoiling books for one another, so I really had no clue what the book was going to be about when I began reading it. I did have a vague feeling it was a feminist book for some reason, but no solid backing on that information. I knew it was considered a classic to some, and those were the general reasons I began reading this book.<br /><br />The book starts off with a somewhat distant teenager / young 20-something living in NYC with various other girls her age who have won a writing contest for a summer internship. While Esther seems like any other distant and socially awkward person, this fact seems to drive her farther and farther away from reality. The book describes her going through some rough happenings in NYC, but nothing that makes the sudden turn she takes from function human being to needing to be committed to an asylum in just a few pages.<br /><br />The insulin therapy and electric shock therapy she receives reminds me of Exley's [[ASIN:0679720766 A Fan's Notes]]. I feel that he describes these horrid experiences more realistically, where as Esther seems to be dreaming the whole time. I'm sure the personal demons she was facing were driving her out of touch with reality, as were the treatments, but Plath seems to be keeping something from the reader.<br /><br />I couldn't help shaking the feeling that she was not revealing the whole truth about the situation, which is fine - it's her novel, not mine. But even the way the book ends, with Esther going in to face the asylum's exit committee for her interview and just stops, leaves me feeling unsatisfied as if more could have been said to help the reader understand the issues at hand. The length of the book even seems to be tied in with this as well, being fairly short it seems more could have been discussed with the reader about her life after the interview.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel more than I did not, but I would not recommend keeping it on that must read list. I just really don't understand what the big deal about this book is.re than I did not, but I would not recommend keeping it on that must read list.

1594744769|5.0|I absolutely love this book!  There was nothing not to love about it.  I had been DYING for this book since the moment I heard about it.  Eventually, I had to go buy a copy and of course, as always, my husband got to it before I did.  The entire time he was dying to tell me everything about it and once I started reading, he kept asking if he could tell me how it ended.<br /><br />We both agreed that Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is nothing like either of us thought it would be.  But that doesn't make it bad.  The idea I had in my head was creepier and scarier, but the book did not disappoint me at all.  It's one of the highest on my list and honestly, I have to say that one of the reasons of that is because of the photographs.  All of them were very interesting and creepy in their own way. I found myself staring at each of them for a few moments, getting a feel for them, investigating them, and admiring their peculiarity.  The coolest thing of all...they real.  Ransom Riggs actually based the entire book around the odd photographs he had found as well as ones his fellow collectors shared.  Honestly, his odd collection and hobby made me curious about all the weird photos I might stumble upon if I actually looked through the bins of photographs and stuff at thrift stores/flea markets.  It might turn into an odd hobby for myself and my husband.<br /><br />The characters in the book are very well written and created.  I loved them.  (As I've already said, I love everything about the book).  The characters are curious, loveable, and very easy to understand and get infatuated with.<br /><br />Even though the book was not what I expected, I loved it, the writing style, the setting, the entire storyline.  It was one that I had NEVER read or heard of before and it kept me guessing and wanting more.  My husband and I both are extremely excited that a second book is in the works.  (My husband actually started cussing at the end and demanded the author write a second novel).<br /><br />I highly, HIGHLY, recommend this book.

B001J32H6M|5.0|The soundtrack for Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom is surprisingly lighter fare than the movie itself. The Mine Car Chase is quite fun, as is The Fast Streets Of Shanghai and Short Round's Theme. The only dark bits in the soundtrack are Bug Tunnel/Death Trap, The Temple Of Doom and Children In Chains. Yet, John Williams has managed to make even these tracks light-hearted, which is interesting considering the overall tone of the film. Oddly enough, the famous Raiders Theme is present during the film and end credits, despite it being a prequel to Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Whatever your opinion of the film may be, check out the soundtrack.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Vote with your wallet and buy the original theatrical version on DVD.  Yes, they look bad.  Yes, they don't fill up a pristine high-def television.  Yes, they're expensive for the relatively low-quality you'll get.  But they're the real versions, not these crude chop jobs.  Just say nooooooo to fake Star Wars.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was disappointed in the changes made in 1997 to Star Wars. Scenes that were wonderful were \\"improved\\". Many of those scenes now make me cringe when I see them. I find the use of CGI along with the puppets and animatronics jarring. BTW, Lucas. The answer to that is to loose the CGI, not the puppets. I like the puppets! Oh, and the same goes for the models in the original movie. Those should not go anywhere or be modified either.    Despite all this, I was excited about a Blu-Ray version being released. It had been a long time since I've seen the movies and I had a little childhood wonderment at the prospect of an even crisper version of the movie and held out hope that the original problems with the DVD released were fixed.    Now, even more changes have been made to the film without even offering the original version of the film. From the reviews I've read, not even all the problems with the 1997 release have been fixed. The tight hold Lucas has had on the film and the piecemeal way it is released has been frustrating. This film had been in important part of my memories growing up, but I have been let down too many times. The last thread of nostalgia I held towards these films is now gone.    R.I.P. Star Wars
B00127RAJY|3.0|I really wanted to like this workout video, but it just isn't that great. The introduction is long and you can't skip through it, so you have to listen to Jillian talk about how great she is for several minutes. Not only is that annoying, it decreases the benefit of a short workout. After doing this faithfully for about a week, my knees were really hurting. I did all of the exercises as directed (I know how to appropriately bend and lunge after taking dance for 10 plus years) and my knees we're popping and hurting. I am 31 and was in good shape prior to starting, and my knees had never really hurt until doing these exercises. Having said all of that, I did feel like I got a complete body workout, but I do have to agree with other reviewers who said it is rather boring. It's a short workout, but every section is boring enough that you focus on just \\"being done already.\\" The music is super lame, the exercises are repetitive, you have to hear her talk too much, and your knees may hurt, but it does help your tummy and calves feel tighter.

B004V6MWFU|3.0|I really enjoyed the Eddie Vedder soundtrack to Into The Wild, so I took a shot on this.    I'm always willing to try new music and while I really enjoy the raspy, yet mello tones of Eddie's voice, it's just a little too much ukulele for me. Yes, I know it's the name of the album, but part of the problem is that there aren't a lot of songs on here that showcase other instruments. By the time I got to track 8, I had enough.  A little depressing as far as tempo and theme, but that's just me. I was expecting more variation between songs like I.T.W.  But I understand he was going for an theme record.    I lent the album to a few friends and they felt the same. Good; but not great. A lot of the songs sound the same.    One has to be in the right mood for song after song of those high pitched strings.    On a side note, the art/design of the CD was well done. I liked the booklet feel with all lyrics included.    I still would like to see/hear Eddie come out with another solo album, but with a little more music diversity.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm quite amazed that people are already writing this box set off because of changes Lucas has made to these movies. While it seems clear some reviewers have somehow gotten to see it before release, I'm surprised how no one has mentioned anything about the Blue-Ray disc quality. After all folks it's a  1080p movie set! Sure, there are the mistakes of adding unnecessary new dialogue such as Vader's \\"Nooooooo\\" sequence and the said CGI rocks hiding R2 but these things are surely small potatoes compared to the hours of untouched stuff in these films! I'm really looking forward to seeing the battle sequence from the opening of Episode III in HD! Even on DVD on an HD TV with upscaling, this sequence looks amazing!  Hayden Christensen puts in a far more convincing performance in Sith than in his previous outing in Attack Of The Clones and Lucas's story is at least a little more airtight, especially at the end of the movie! Having seen most of the incarnations of the Star Wars saga, I'm anticipating a pristine HD version. to see it in more detail on a large HD TV is an exciting prospect and I'm sure, everyone has known for ever that these movies were made just for this format!
B004EPYZTE|2.0|Really thought this would be an entertaining flick,for a drunken night out with the crew.Actually 3 out of 5 guys fell asleep and the only reason I stayed awake was a group of equally bored girls next to us.The movie simply lacks the charm of the old Schwarzenegger ones.Nispel always fails to create an atmosphere that can put up with the originals.He somehow manages to make every movie look like it was done by 'directing unit 7'.  If you liked movies like Pathfinder or 10 000 BC;you probably like this one to.
B000LB7G00|2.0|Wanted to use this as a standard mouse but the buttons are too small and have to be pressed pretty hard and as such cannot be easily used as left/right button.    The software to use this as an ordinary mouse is still in beta release and is not easy to configure.
0440178002|5.0|I've read Shogun twice and have enjoyed it quite a bit each time. Clavell's story of 17th century Japan is a classic in my opinion, filled with action, love, plot twists and memorable characters. I'd highly recommend it.
0307454541|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of the best mystery novels ever written. Compelling, haunting, and utterly absorbing, it's a completely necessary read for anyone who considers themselves a fan of...well, reading. Steig Larsson kicks things off slowly, carefully layering his characters with depth and a sense of reality before he plunges them into volatile situations. If there's one thing that has to be appreciated about Larsson, it's that the suspense his books create doesn't come from pure shock--its because he makes us genuinely care about his characters. It also has to be said that in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, 90% of the tension and suspense comes from the fact that its just a masterfully-crafted mystery that would make Sir Arthur Conan Doyle proud. The moments of violence are few and far between, and they're presented to add depth to the characters, not to provide fleeting thrills.
B005MF1O5S|3.0|This is just a filler episode. Its interesting at times, but merely a filler. Nothing amazing or revolutionary here. The only interesting thing is the development of Amy and Rory and the question of two Amy's, but even there, its a very secondary storyline. And unless they manage to tie this episode in somehow with the other episodes, it becomes pointless and possibly even absurd when considered in the bigger picture of the entire season. The doctor is going to die, we're in the second half of the season, and instead of figuring things out about the doctor's death, they go sightseeing. \\"Sightseeing\\" episodes are much better at the beginning of the season. Either that, or they must be very interesting, like \\"Midnight\\" in season 4. Part of the reason could be the person who wrote this episode: Tom MacRae wrote this episode, and unlike the two episodes he wrote way back in Season 2 (\\"Rise of the Cybermen\\" and \\"The Age of Steel\\"), it is simply not that good. The question of two Amy's brings back memories of \\"Father's Day\\" in episode 1 and the problem of having the same person meet at different points in their timeline. Of course, this brings up some interesting questions involving the Reapers who are supposed to appear when someone changes their own timeline. Does Amy's helping of her past self warrant a big enough time disturbance to bring in the Reapers? When you consider that when Rose touches the younger version of herself, causing the Reapers to gain more power, it would seem that the problem with space-time should have been much bigger. It is still worth watching, if only for the Rory-Amy aspect, but it definitely won't be the most remembered episode of this season, unless it is for its possible inconsistencies with past episodes.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|To start off, I write this not as an irate fanboy, but rather as a concerned citizen as to the direction in which a historically significant and classic piece of cinema is being taken and is becoming lost to the ages.    The current Blu-ray set of Star Wars being offered here DOES NOT include the Original Theatrical Releases of the Original Star Wars Trilogy. They do however include the revised versions with past and recently added changes to the Original films of 'Star Wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi'.     Why does this matter? The original three films, Star Wars (1977), the Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The Return of the Jedi (1983)as they were released in the theaters are now considered classic films. However, in 1997 they were re-released in theaters as 'Special Editions' with many changes to the visual effects, color quality, sound and editing. These 'Special Editions' significantly altered the content, style, and characters in several scenes of the films. These 'Special Editions' were again released on DVD in 2004 with even more changes but were no longer called 'Special Editions' but just 'The Star Wars Trilogy' even though they were not the Original Theatrical versions of the films as they were seen when first released in the theaters. At that time many fans began to become concerned that the Original Theatrical versions of the films were not released on DVD as well. In 2006 Lucasfilm released a 'Star Wars Limited Edition' DVD set which included the original theatrical versions as 'bonus discs'. However, the original version 'bonus' discs were of very poor quality and were from the masters used to produce the laserdisc releases of Star Wars a decade earlier and not the masters used to produce the 'Special Edition' versions of the films. Furthermore, the Original Theatrical versions of films were presented in a letterbox format rather than the current standard anamorphic presentation which further reduced the image quality. By the way, the 'Limited Edition Star Wars Trilogy' DVD set which is the only one that contains the Original Theatrical versions of all three films has now been discontinued at the same time as the release of this Blu-ray set. Is this a coincidence, or a concerted effort by Lucasfilm to subvert the original theatrical versions of Star Wars?    The Blu-ray set being offered here adds further changes to the ones already seen in the 'Special Edition' releases. These current changes compounded with the changes we have already seen over the past decade continue to significantly alter the films from their original theatrical release form. These continual changes along with Lucasfilm's refusal to release the Original Theatrical versions of the films in high quality on a modern video format such as Blu-ray amounts to a systematic erasure of the culturally and historically significant Original Theatrical versions of the films Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.     Ironically, in 1988 George Lucas himself stood before Congress and gave a speech against altering significant historical and classic films:     'A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.    People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as \\"when life begins\\" or \\"when it should be appropriately terminated,\\" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.' - George Lucas    Mr. Lucas,if you want to change your films then please do so, but not at the expense of letting the Original 'Classic' and 'Historically Significant' Theatrical versions of the Star Wars films being forever lost.    Imagine if 'Citizen Kane' was permanently colorized, or the lines from Casablanca's famous ending changed, or the 'Maltese Falcon' re-edited ... really, please think about if THAT happened. Well, THAT is what is happening to 'Star Wars'.    Given the current rate at which the Original Trilogy is being altered, what will the films we know as 'Star Wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' look like in 10 - 20 years from now ? Do you care about cultural and cinematic history? If you do then please make an informed decision.    I thank you for your time.
B0059IVV9M|5.0|Love this band!  I liked their early stuff, but they keep improving.  Rip Tide is good from start to finish, although the last two songs are weaker -- two filler songs on the back end of a cd is pretty good.  Rip Tide, Santa Fe, Goshen, and East Harlem (borrowed from earlier efforts) are very good.  Keeps getting better with each listening.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|This is my first album by Joe Bonamassa and I'm surely enjoying it!  Years back I used to listened  to the \\"Old Blues Men\\" but then became interested in other genres which filled up my listening time.  Coming upon this album by accident - a recommendation by Amazon - I'm glad to see that young talent is taking up the cause. JB has much talent and reading his bio I'm doubly impressed.<br /><br />  This album covers some standards as well as originals and shows off his excellent guitar work. The other members of his group are of the same caliber as he is.  His voice has just the right amount of \\"untrainedness\\" to it to make the listener feel like he really does \\"have the blues\\".  Not just mouthing it.  He seems to have borrowed from the old and put his own spin on it.<br /><br />  I would recommend this album highly to anyone who is a beginning rocking blues lover, an old hand, or someone finding the blues again.  I've listened to it a number of times and have only had it a few days.  Great!  I will be buying more from his repertoire soon.
0783231202|4.0|Definitely NOT one of the better known Steven Speilberg movies in India, which is the only disappointing thing about this movie. If one wants to know what acting is, watch Anthony Hopkins in this movie and you shall know why he is called Sir Anthony. Must watch.
B001GKPXSM|3.0|As my title says, I prefer this album as background. Or music to go to sleep by.<br /><br />  I consider this genre New Age or Very Light Classical.  It's quite pretty and relaxing but has little depth.  I would say if you like Philip Aaberg, George Winston, or Lori Line you will love this album.  If you are a lover of \\"Classical\\", you will not find this satisfying.<br /><br /> Don't let the negative tone of my review turn you off to it completely.  I do like it playing on my computer when I do some websurfing or am housecleaning.  Probably will use it during worktime as well. I don't think I'd buy any other of his albums - after listening to clips from them they all seem to blend into one.  I find this a lot with New Age music.
B002NXSRX4|4.0|Two dear friends joined me to watch this video game of a movie on a Sunday. GI Joe is a comic book on celluloid. It is such fun watching super heroes fighting psycopathic villains who have a scientific approach to crime and have evil dreams of Global Dominance. Of course, comic books are not supposed to appeal to the jury for the Nobel Prize-for-literature, hence, the cynic can find a million holes in the story. Allow the child within to take charge, and you will find this movie thrilling, exciting and dollops of fun. It will surely make the Sunday biryani taste better. Food, friends, Coke and GI Joe.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is the last straw, I think I have 6 or 7 complete copies of Star Wars, I have bought, gotten as gifts over the last 20 years on 3 different formats (Laser Disk, VHS and DVD). I've had enough. The endless changes to the films, the horrible transfer with all the really bad color issues. The oh so lack luster HD transfer, which was not done right to begin with. The lack of promised deleted scenes. I cringe to think what the 3D versions of the films will be. Peter Jackson made 2 versions of each of the rings films, the theatrical and the Special Editions. He released both on blu-ray and did not mess with them after they were in the can. Why can't george just stop and release it as is?    I've had enough. I've seen them many times on cable in HD. Why didn't they just used those version? Why make more changes? Why why why?    No more of my money for Star Wars movies for you George.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|In \\"Despicable Me\\" there is a scene where Gru enters a Bank which funds VILLAINS and is called The Bank of Evil - at the entrance there is a plate which reads \\"formerly Lehman Brothers\\". Need I say more about the wit and humour in the movie. It is hilarious.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Let me start by saying this is one cool watch!     Here are the pros in no particular order:  - GPS enabled that allows you to figure out how far you've ran, where and altitude changes.  - It also tells you how fast you're going, i.e. your pace.  - It has the option for adjustable distance markers, i.e. you can set to set 1 lap every 1 mile and it gives you a single beep. Of course with my headphones on, I rarely hear it.  - The Garmin website is pretty easy to navigate and it is super cool to see your performance on various charts.  - The route mapping on the website is the coolest since you're able to see a trace of your run in the map.  - The heart rate monitoring is cool as you can check your bpm, and also it tells you how many calories you've burn per lap and total.  - The watch itself is fairly light weight and not too bulky. Although if they could make it smaller that would be better of course.  - The ANT sync is pretty cool. The initial set up is not too difficult. Afterward it's super easy because you just hook up the ANT to the USB and then let the computer do it's magic. You do have to be patient and basically let it sit there by itself for about 10 to 20 mins.  - Starting your run is pretty quick (assuming you have established the satellite link, see point below).    The cons are:  - The bazel is not as easy to operate when you want to cycle between laps after you've finished your run.  - The strap is not the most comfortable, but it does come with an adjustable velcro strap.  - The battery life is not the longest. You basically can go for maybe 4 runs (4-5mi each) and it's pretty much dead. I guess the GPS is what sucks the battery away.  - There is only one color available for the 405CX. It would be nice to have some other colors.  - The heart rate monitor strap is a little wide for my taste and when you run and you're sweaty, it has a tendency to start sliding down your torso towards your stomach.  - Acquiring the satellite signal is a little slow, about 5- 10mins. That's not bad for me since you can turn on the GPS while you're warming up before your run.    Overall I'm very happy with my Forerunner 405CX in-spite of some of the negatives. I don't know about long term reliability, but I do hope this baby lasts me for a while since it's not particularly cheap. I definitely recommend this if you're serious about running.     Enjoy!
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I have used the Garmin Forerunner 205, 305, and now have the 405cx.  I have always been happy with my past units so I was excited when my  husband gave me the 405cx for Christmas.  I have been very disappointed with it and if my old 305 was still operating I would go back to it.  Here are my issues:    1)  I am mostly a runner but I also like to bike.  The 305 was very easy to transition from running to biking and so on.  The 405cx does not have an easy mode button to switch between sports.  To change to biking I first have to select biking and then change all the screens so that they reflect mph instead of minutes per mile and then switch it back when I want to run again. Too time consuming!    2)  I like the bigger screen on the 305.  Granted I am 48 and maybe when I was younger it wouldn't be an issue but I can't have more than 2 things on the screen or it is too small for me to read when I'm running.    3)  I hate the bezel!  I set it to the screen I want to run with and lock the bezel because it weirds out if I don't. I am a sweater and moisture and touch bezel are obviously not a good combination.  When I ran with my 305 I would rotate between 3 screens with 3-4 fields on each but now I just see the 2 fields that I've locked on the screen of the 405.    4)  Keeps turning off when not in operation.  I find this very frustrating at races to have to keep remembering to touch my watch so it will stay on.  I have started races and tried to press start and it is on saver mode because I forgot to keep waking it up.    5)  My biggest complaint is with the battery life.  I keep my watch plugged in at all times.  I learned from experience that I need to always have a full charge when I run.  Even starting with a full charge, on my longer runs (over 3 hours) I am at low battery when I return. I am running a marathon in October and I am not sure if it will keep a charge for the whole distance as I have not used it over 4 hours.  Also we are a camping family and sometimesare away for a week.  I like to run when I am vacationing and my 305 could keep a battery charge for the week.  My 405cx not so much.    The good points of it are that it does pick up satellites fast, is accurate, and downloads to computer software very easily.    I read another review and they loved the battery life so maybe I just got a dud!!  I tell everyone I know that Garmin Forerunners are great but this one is a dud.
0743201140|5.0|Everyone at our company uses this book and we publish a chart on our intranet that allows us all to see each others top five strengths. This helps tremendously when recruiting teams for projects and with strategic planning.

030788743X|5.0|I do not claim to be a gamer, and I am surely a bit too old to be considered a child of the '80s, yet this book transported me to a place that the best of films of that era still have the power to create. If WarGames, Blade Runner, Star Wars and the original Tron had a love child in print, this is it.  There are the obligatory late teen protagonists, the evil corporate terror mongers, the benevolent older protectors, a dystopic world gone awry in a perpetual energy crisis and an alternate reality created by as yet undeveloped technology. Like the artifacts of the bygone era the author clearly loves, while the action is thrilling, and the baddies are really bad, there is an essential innocence and faith in the power of love that infuses this first rate adventure with ability to make you feel hopeful without being made ill by an overly saccharine aftertaste.    Make sure you are well provisioned before you start reading. Like the addicted citizens of Cline's future, once you enter the OASIS, you won't want to leave until the end of the game.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Back to 1978, when I borrowed a friend's beta VCR to copy a video-tape of \\"Star Wars\\".* Home video was in it's infancy, but who knew that in over 30 years the original film that was nominated for 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture, would no longer be available to the public? Aside from older dvd and VHS releases.<br /><br />That exclusion is the reason that this is the one & ONLY time I plan to ever write a review before the product's release. (Although, only Sith deals in absolutes.)<br /><br />I recently bought Ridley Scott's \\"Blade Runner\\". He included the theatrical/international/director's & final cut on the dvd set. Same with JC's \\"Aliens\\" and SS's \\"E.T.\\". As I recall my \\"Wizard of Oz\\", \\"The Color Purple\\", \\"Rocky Horror\\", \\"Roger Rabbit\\" and \\"Beetlejuice\\" have all survived well on my dvd shelf (AND in the public's hearts) without needing poorly \\"tinkered\\" versions.<br /><br />Almost no one would've begrudged Lucas some cosmetic touch-ups 'here and there' to smooth out some old effects shots. But of course, another great talent named Michael Jackson just started off with a few minor changes. Now I see their careers heading dowsn a strangely similar path.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray package, minus the first theatrical versions, combined with public statements, cements the fact that he has virtually dis-owned the films that he, and countless talented craftsmen, like John Dykstra, Rick Baker, Phil Tippett, Dennis Muren, & even Frank Oz and John Williams (to name a few) so carefully crafted. Hey, did he cut John Ratzenberger out of \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" because he was that \\"Cheers\\" guy? ;)<br /><br />Bottom line: The filmmaker dis-owns the magic he made and people fell in love with, he dis-owns those fans who supported him. It's sad.<br /><br />*Let me add, before that bootleg I bought the official 8mm 15-min film release of Star Wars, and almost every VHS and dvd version since. I've spent a good share of money on SW, not including the books and my plush Wookiee.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I bought this after a friend of mine who I used to play video games with 30 years ago recommended it on his blog.     If you played video games in the 1980's this is just about a must read. The author mentions tons of great \\"you had the be there\\" 80's memories - from the secret room in adventure to the song PacMan fever, dungeons and dragons to japanese cartoons and text based adventure games and literally hundreds of other awesome nostalgic memories from movies and music  are incorporated seamlessly into the storyline. So well in fact that I now have a list of old movies to go watch because I did not get the references but I wanted to (Ladyhawke...)     At the same time that the story has a strong 80's slant, it is very much about a possible future reality as well. It has the mega corporations dominating society, the decline of civilization as well as cool new technology built into the core of the game. It is also a believable reality and one that does not sound that far away.    I could not put the book down because it meshed the past into the future so well, told an interesting story and made the plot fun - if not necessarily 100% believable at all times, but the fun far outweighed those few moments.     If you grew up in the 1980's and remember thinking of Galaga or Ms Pacman or Defender arcade games as a great value for a quarter because you could kill 45 minutes on a single quarter, then this book is for you. This book will enjoyably kill 5-6 hours and at the end you will want 2 things: more from this author and for someone to invent the OASIS like right now.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've learned to live with the changes made in the Star Wars films up to this point.  Doesn't make Greedo shooting first any harder to swallow but I adapted.  At least to the extent that I was still spending my hard earned money on Star Wars in general.  Now that is not the case.  George Lucas has ruined a pinnacle moment in cinema by adding \\"Nooo\\" to what was once one of the best non dialogued scenes in movie history.  For this I cannot forgive Lucas.  And for that he will never see another dime from me until I am able to purchase a version in which that scene does not exist in the manner it does. Why a creator chooses to alienate his fan base in the manner George Lucas has is beyond me.  What once made Lucas the revered rogue filmaker that defied the Directors Guild is now the same thing that is destroying many people's fondest memories on film.      \\"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\\"   Indeed.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This is one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. It has everything a great film needs: action, drama, romance, mystery and (most important of all) fun. This is what a summer movie is supposed to be.

B0053Q9DHW|2.0|I recieved this film and looked forward to watching it with great anticipation. The reviews from the critics and on Amazon had been glowing and this film was mean't to be the film adaptation to end all...Ah no. I can't say how disappointed I was with this version. Maybe the director just couldn't decide whether it should be a gothic thriller or a love story. Certainly the actors seemed to be a bit confused. There was absolutley no chemisty between Mia Wasiskowka and Michael Fassbender... They are both as cold as an artic winter and there is no reason why they suddenly develope this passion for each other other than they were trapped at Thornfield Hall and were a bit bored. Judi Dench as ususal was wonderful to watch but she couldn't save this clunker.And what happened to Mrs Rochester...she was barely a passing reflection in a window... Maybe the problem is that the length and depth of the novel is not suitable to be compressed such as this is into two hours. If you are wanting to see two excellent production then both BBC Jane Eyre's with Zela Clark and Timothey Dalton  or Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens are far superior.
B0000TB014|5.0|I bought this for my Niece & she loved it & still has it till this day. We both love it & it was for her so she would be the best critic rather than me because I sent it to her but it came in good quality & that's very important

B0019LY5IM|3.0|If you read my review of Season 2, you know I went gaga over this series. Everyone warned me that the first 2 or 3 seasons were great. Then the writers/actors had gone on strike and the writing suffered. Now, I tend to agree. Without giving anything away, the show got a little out there with time travel entering into the mix. It made an interesting show confusing with some time travel flashes taking place a minute apart. There were also less episodes in the later seasons, again, I believe due to the stike. It is still a good show and I am anxious to see how everything ties together, but the first few seasons were much better.
B001HN690O|5.0|set-up for the third installment in the franchise.  I like that we got all the background information on Po's origins.  The next movie should see Po reunited with some of his fellow panda tribesmen.  I loved this movie, my kids loved this movie, it is definitely worth adding to the collection.  Highly recommended. Can't wait to get my copy.
B000FIMG68|5.0|AWESOME!!! I didn't get to watch it when it was on television. I started watching the DVDs and I can't stop. As soon as one disk ends I practically trip over my coffee table on the way to get the next one in to find out what happens. Great show!!!

6305320802|5.0|Oklahoma! is a charming and often funny musical which produced a host of \\"old standards\\": The title song, Everything's up to Date in Kansas City, The Farmers and the Cowboys should be Friends, I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say No, The Surrey with the Fringe on Top, People Will Say We're in Love, and of course, the outstanding opening ... \\"Oh What a Beautiful Morning\\". \\"Poor Judd is Dead\\" is one of the most unusual and amusing songs in any musical, as the hero tries to convince a wretched hired hand that the world would glorify him in his absence, and maybe he should just go ahead and claim that glory for himself! LOL<br /><br />Gordon McRea and Shirley Jones give outstanding performances in the main roles, and Rod Steiger makes a suitably creepy Judd. Eddie Albert is very funny as the traveling salesman with a problem.<br /><br />The Cinemascope presentation on this early DVD version is bright and sharp. The sound comes through cleanly and enjoyably. This is an excellent way to experience this classic film at a time of your choosing. These outstanding musicals are just not shown often enough on broadcast channels anymore. They represent a long gone era where producers and directors cared that those voicing the songs could actually sing. I reference the star-studded but musically bereft \\"Mama Mia\\" as a modern example of how a musical can go very, very wrong. Back in the 50s and early 60s they never went wrong, especially when Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II were involved!
B000O1799U|5.0|This is such a great movie ! Best Actress winner Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce makes a win, win movie ! Add to the cast Eddie Murphy and Jamie Fox.<br /><br />I usually am not a fan of  Broadway musicals turned in to movies, but this works on all levels !
0553801473|4.0|Honestly, the best of A Dance With Dragons is some of the best writing in the series to date. The Bran chapters, the Reek chapters, even some of Tyrion's darker moments. I do wish there was more of a conclusion, which is why this isn't a 5 star book. I believe it when the author says it was tough to write. It's massive and it spans all over the place. But what it does most effectively is move the main characters into position for a really big conclusion (Jon, Dany, Tyrion, Arya, Bran). Even better it does in ways that don't seem cheap or forced to me. I think the majority of any ill will toward this book is 99% anger over having to wait so long for it. Even more so, the knowledge that even if you just started the series, it's likely to be a long time before the next one arrives. But when you take that all away, you're left with a ton of story here and some magnificent writing.
0316098329|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was the best book I've read in a while.  Although some of the other reviews mention that it lacks some information, like details about Jack's mother and kidnapper, the story is from 5-year-old Jack's point of view, and the author never waivers from telling the story through his eyes.  I recommend reading this book.
0385233132|5.0|Asimov takes us back to the twilight of the Galactic Empire and on a tour of the Imperial capital planet of Trantor through the eyes of a young Hari Seldon, who has just given his first paper on psychohistory - a rudimentary principle that could possibly be used to predict future events on a large scale - at a mathematics conference. The emperor, Cleon I, having heard of Seldon's paper in passing, wonders if Seldon and his psychohistory could be used to predict a positive future for his time on the throne and has Seldon brought to him, only to be disappointed that Seldon's psychohistory is in it's infancy and isn't practical for what the emperor wants.<br /><br />However, the emperor's first advisor, Damerzel, thinks that Seldon might be a threat if capture by enemies of the throne and seeks to capture or at least contain Seldon. Newsman Chetter Hummin rescues Seldon from capture and through his guile and apparently endless contacts, keeps Hari one step ahead of the Emperor's grasp and at the same time tells him that the Empire is crumbling and that Seldon's psychohistory might be all that stands between total collapse. In his flight, Seldon will spend time in one of Trantor's university districts, living among the strange and backwards Mycoginians, touring the heat sinks of blue collar Dahl, and finally in the grasp of the throne's largest enemy on Trantor, the Wye district.<br /><br />Just one of Asimov's amazing abilities is to make a relatively mundane book by Foundation standards still seem like a grand adventure. What Prelude to Foundation lacked in galaxy-wide consequences, it made up for in detailed glimpses of the early life of Hari Seldon. While some critics have said Prelude was one prequel too many, I wish there had been time in Asimov's life for even more.

1400044162|5.0|I dig this book!  Its really well written and i love how Chimamanda mixes Igbo with english.  I'm not Igbo but now i know a few words.  I've been curious about what happened in the war and this book satisfies my in more ways than a documentary could.
B00003CXB4|5.0|THE DVD CAME IN TIME AND OF COURSE IN GREAT CONDITIONS.   AS SOON AS I GOT IT I PLAYED IT ALL NIGHT!
B000050GQM|1.0|The movie came on time, but it can only be viewed in England. I don't know why they would sell it to an American. When I wrote to them, they said, basically, \\"too bad. It was in the specs.\\" However, they suggested that I try it on my computer. Well, it worked, but the movie paused in the middle and wouldn't go any further. I wrote to them and sent the movie back. I have yet to hear from them. Be careful when you buy a movie that it plays in the States.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Like many others, I discovered this series because of the HBO show Game of Thrones. I read GoT in a week and enjoyed it. I found Martin to be a bit wordy but at least the story moved forward. I started A Clash of Kings back in May. I just finished it today. It wasn't bad but just okay.<br /><br />Some chapters were fantastic. They held my attention and moved the story along. Those I would rate 5 stars. Unfortunately, there were more 1 star chapters than 5 star chapters. Some chapters were down right boring. So I would swtich to something else to read. Wonderfully written prose doesn't mean a thing if it doesn't tell a story. Descriptions about locations and food are not a story. From what I can tell with the reviews for DWD, this just gets worse as the series goes on.<br /><br />I love stories that are told from multiple points of view. I didn't seem to mind it in GoT, but it was more a choppy read in CoK. Since I am already aware of the style in which this series is written, I'm going forward and accepting the rest of the books will read the same way.<br /><br />I still like Dany's story line as well as Tyrion's. Despite that I thought CoK was just okay, I still want to read Storm of Swords which I have already opened up on my Kindle all ready for me to read. Fingers crossed that SoS will be much better.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am with vast majority of the fan here that There needs to be Originals in Blu-ray instead of the altered version.
B000088E6D|5.0|I listened to a sample of Michael's music and I bought it on my EVO right away. This is the perfect album for those who are romantic at heart. His voice is phenomenal. I know that Michael Buble has a God given gift to sooth his listeners and put you in a good mood. He has definitely perfected his craft, never heard anyone like him, I would travel to go hear him. Please support him.

B001PJRAUS|3.0|The premise of this was a fun one.  Too bad they pretty much screwed it up.  First off it was extremely difficult to have an empathy for the lead actress and her character.  As other reviewers said, if she liked the era so much in the book why didn't she try to adapt more. And personally I found her uninteresting and crude.  I couldn't believe she was really an Austen fan.  The rest of the plots were either silly or made no sense.  Yes she would have some affect on the characters but I found it very hard to believe they would accept her and her appearance so easily.  The other actors/actresses were okay, even though their characters' personalties were changed from the book.  I'm not going into plot details, you can read othe reviews that have done good jobs of that.<br /><br />All that said, the only good thing about this mess was Elliot Cowan as Darcy.  He had the perfect arrogant good looks and that passion just beneath the surface.  And he's a hunk.  His personal emotional versus rational inner fight was portrayed perfectly.  So many of the Darcy actors either over-do one or the other.  I gave it 3 stars for the attempt and for Cowan.<br /><br /> I watched it and copied it on cable.  But I pretty much only watch the last half over again.  I would never buy it.
