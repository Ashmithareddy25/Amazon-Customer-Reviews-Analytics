0345803485|1.0|This is, without a doubt the worst written book I have ever read.  What a waste of 500 pages.  The characters are one-dimensional, they have no authentic dialogue and I did not care about either of them.  There was barely an adjective to be found and when there  was one it was repeated over and over and over.  He was \\"hot\\" and her reaction to everything was Holy Crap, Holy Moses, Holy hell .... ad nauseam.  They possessed only two turn-ons and they were repeated again and again - She would bite her lip and his pants hung on his hips The lack of imagination is unbelievable.  They are either smiling or frowning.  How interesting.<br /><br />The sex scenes were not even original. She orgasmed at every little thing.  The character of Christian did not  follow through on his strict contracts to be dominant, therefore rendering his mysterious background moot.<br /><br />The entire book infers that, at some point, you will discover what has made him this way - but no. You do not discover anything. They break up and she goes home and cries.  After 500 pages you have no insight, no answers, no satisfaction - save your time and money.<br /><br />It is disturbing that a publisher would print this horribly written book without revision because it probably could have been interesting.
B0059WTMLW|1.0|I love sudoku, but I don't love this. The controls don't make sense and there are a million pointless options.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book simply tells the tale of the relationship between an innocent literature graduate and mouth watering multibillionaire.  The story goes that Christian Grey wines, dines and woos Anastasia Steele before they partake in a series of sexual endeavours using various sex toys. I loved it so much that I am actually at the moment re reading the entire Trilogy. I love it EL James blew Stephenie Mayers out of the water with this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I will admit that what first drew me to this book was the scandalous nature of it. Well meaning friends were telling me to stay away because of my Christian, innocent nature, but that's exactly what intrigued me. Defiantly, I decided to get the book and read it. What harm could it do? Many women these days seem to be reading it, so it would make a great conversation starter. This book is about two main characters, Anastasia and Christian. They met when Anastasia interviewed him for an article her friend wanted to write, and she fell for his dark mysterious nature. She later realized that he, too was falling for her. He wasn't into conventional relationships, however, but Anastasia was willing to continue getting to know him. Yes, the steamy sexual nature of this book is very much prominent, and I wouldn't recommend this book to the faint of heart. It does defy my Christian values, however, there was something beyond the surface that intrigued me about Christian. His dark past. This is why I went on to the second book, in order to find out more.

1781161097|4.0|for those movie fans who love to read about the behind the scenes stuff, this book would make for a pretty cool gift.  it's divided into a number of sections, each focusing on one specific element of \\"Prometheus\\".  one section will show you the storyboards for the film's epic opening sequence, while another will give the details behind the design of the 'engineers' and the myriad other monsters,etc.  what i found really cool were the 'concept art' sketches that were ultimately abandoned by the production crew.  some of those looked really awesome.<br /><br />the only criticism that i really have is i would have liked more focus on the \\"Prometheus\\" characters, and what the thoughts/ideas of the actors playing them were.  a couple of paragraphs from each actor would have been nice.<br />still, this is really a minor nitpick, since i really do recommend this for the movie's fans.
B005O64VH8|5.0|In the last ten years, I have listened to Secret Garden's songs more than most I'm sure.  They are magical somehow and I find myself crying again, amazed that they still touch me so deeply though I have listened to them so many hundreds of times.  They are eternal melodies that become more precious to me each time I play them.<br /><br />After taking in this new album, I cannot say that I agree with many of the reviewers here.  A soul like Rolf Lovland's runs much deeper than a few similar lines of music, and that soul still reaches out and touches mine.  Winter Poems is drenched with the same emotion I first felt when I unwrapped their first album.<br /><br />There is no music on the planet that I love more.  Thank you Rolf and Fionnuala for the magic!

1936608898|5.0|When I first received my copy of \\"It Starts With Food\\" I was a little bit skeptical.  Another Paleo Book?  I've been following the Paleo lifetyle for several years, I've completed the Whole30 several times and help others take on the challenge as a gym owner.  I've read Robb Wolf, Gary Taubes, Mark Sisson etc...  I was definitely skeptical that there could be anything new.<br /><br />I could not have been more wrong!  I loved the four \\"Good Food Standards.\\"  In addition to providing a solid framework that gives the book an easy flow, they really force the reader to think about the multitide of ways our food choices affect us.  The explanation of each standard had just enough science to explain what goes on inside the body without completely losing those of us who are less scientifically inclined!<br /><br />It's one thing to explain the science behind this stuff so that everyone can understand it, but it's another thing entirely to give readers the tools to implement change in their life.  Dallas and Melissa do just that with both their \\"Whole30\\" and strategies for long term success.  Perhaps most importantly, the material is presented in such a way that it gives the reader confidence that this is something they can actually do!!<br /><br />I have already recommended this book to friends, family and members at my gym and I will continue to do so.  If you are serious about health and nutrition, this book is a MUST READ!
B00756GKBA|5.0|Although it pains me to say aloud, my sister & I had some reservations about this album before its release. For the first time in Madonna's career, and we've been die-hard fans from the very start, we were a little nervous about the musical direction she had chosen for MDNA. As die-hard fans, we automatically dislike artists such as Janet Jackson & Britney Spears etc because they're wannabes & clowns compared to The Queen of Pop. So when we heard Give Me All Your Luvin' for the first time, we were concerned that someone in the Madonna camp misguided her into thinking she has to sound more like the Nicki Minajs, Lady Gagas, & Katy Perrys out there (the wannabes of today) in order to remain relevant & popular. Luckily though, our reservations were completely put to rest when we heard the entire album for the first time. As usual, each Madonna album sounds nothing like her last. And as usual, each Madonna album is superior to any & every other Pop album on the charts with her. My favorite songs happen to be the ones that are most likely directly related to her divorce from director Guy Ritchie. By the way, does anyone else get soooo mad that he found tremendous success with the Sherlock Holmes films AFTER he already walked away with loads of HER hard-earned money?? Sadly, it sounds that she was left to question if money had more to do with his love for her than she ever thought before. I love the meaningful play on words in songs like Love Spent--\\"If I was your treasury, you'd have found a time to treasure me.\\" And later, \\"Till death do we part. That's what you said.\\" And it's in that last sentiment that I love Gang Bang so much. \\"You had to die for me baby...I need you to die for me baby.\\" Obviously I don't encourage and/or condone someone actually acting on feelings such as those, but in the form of a song I imagine it's very cathartic for her. Anyway, I listened to the album non-stop for like 3 weeks, 8+ hours a day (since music, fortunately, is allowed at my office). And I never tire of listening to it either!

B006Y9BVRM|5.0|I ordered my new Seiko Men's Solar Diver Chronograph Watch on 01/06, it was shipped the next day 02/06, and it arrive 4 days before the earliest estimated delivery date. The watch was fully packaged in showroom condition with all relevant documentation including user guide and warranty. The International Warranty Card was completed by the seller. The watch was identical to the watch I looked at in a store, but at a fraction of the store cost. The watch has exceptional features which I am very pleased with, e.g. solar powered, light weight, easy to read, screw crowns for safety, easy to use chronograph functions. I am very impressed with my purchase from this seller and will defiantly purchase future watches from them. I would also have no hesitations recommending them for their service, product and price.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I'm surprised this movie didn't receive as much or more fanfare than Avatar.  I think it's the title, it's not catchy enough to spark the curiousity of a typical moviegoer.  Anyway, I rented the streaming video from Amazon for 48 hours and as much as it's a long movie, I watched it twice in 2 days because I liked it so much.  For some reason, I can relate more to the story and characters in this movie.  The setting was on Mars but there's a lot of the typical 'Jasoom' (earth) feelings and emotions portrayed here.  I'm a fan of science fiction and my taste range from the prehistoric like the Clan of the Cave Bears to futuristic like Asimov's Robots and Foundation.  And I felt I got both from this movie.  Very entertaining,  easy to understand and very enganging.  Highly recommended!!!  I am now reading the 'Princess of Mars' and so far so good.

B007V4LKRU|5.0|Update: After numerous re-listens, I think this album is the peak of their creative powers and deserves a 5-star rating.<br /><br />Yes, there are already too many reviews, and it hasn't even been 24-hours since it was officially released. However, I am going to focus on the two LP set. I did purchase the CD as well to burn to iTunes, but it turns out there is an undisclosed MP3 download form inside the LP. Oh well.  I listened to the CD first, why? Because I had to wash the records in my Spin-Clean system to clean out stuff in the grooves and remove static. Unfortunately, every new LP arrives with enough static to raise your arm hair and make all kinds of awful pops and ticks during playback.<br /><br />Anyhow, back to the sonics. The CD is very clean and crisp, or, in other words, the best modern digital is capable of. I used my Musical Fidelity DAC as an interface, and the tubes in my gear warmed the tone nicely, especially the acoustic guitars in &#34;The Garden.&#34; I was still washing other new records when the CD ended, so I hit play again. Yes, I too have heard the first two tracks many times since downlaoding them last year; so when the CD hit the rocking &#34;Seven Cities of Gold,&#34; I stopped the playback to check out the vinyl.<br /><br />Side three is where the aforementioned track begins, and I listened to the three songs on this side with much appreciation for the wider, three-dimensional soundstage. There is more separation in the instruments and sonic textures on vinyl (I have a humble Pro-Ject Debut III with an Ortofon 2M Red cartridge). On side four, The last tracks seem to rise up from their grooves and shimmer in the air. The last track on vinyl, &#34;The Garden,&#34; was even more harmonically rich, the acoustic guitar could have been a neighbor playing, it was that vivid. Admittedly, two hours of Rush at high volume required a listening break, but I will spin the first disc shortly. I am sure the digital to analog debate will still rage, but I feel the LPs are well-worth purchasing. I was lucky to get Snakes and Arrows before it went out of print, and good luck finding it for under $125!<br /><br />Followup: I finished the first disc, and as I noted earlier, the sound is tonally richer in analog, and not because of my equipment either. I have to say that the album does grow on the listener. I think it is hard to make a complete assessment in one day. I do stand by my opinion that the LPs outshine the CD, however. If you have a turntable, buy this set. I noticed that the artwork in the CD booklet is a little better produced than the LP sleeves, but that is trivial. After I washed the discs, I put them in MOFI anti-stat sleeves because the stock paper ones can scuff the surface of the records.<br /><br />All-in-all, Rush has presented us with some seriously heavy jams, and an intricate story. Since most of the reviews are being made after 2-3 listens, I think that time will be the best judge, and even the harshest critic can't wait to see them live again. I really like the production, and the guitar-work is phenomenal.h purchasing. I was lucky to get Snakes and Arrows before it went out of print, and good luck finding it for under $125!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I must say, I finished all three books within a matter of two days. Why? I don't know. It might either be the events occuring or just how sad everything seems. The killings and the torture of innocent people. The sadness of Rue dying followed by the event that occured at her district. Katniss has done everything right, yet it all seems so wrong.<br /><br />This has to be the first trioligy I teared up of because I knew her story ended. The whole time I felt as if Katniss should choose Peeta but what I found out at the end, killed me. How her best friend abandoned her and how her mother never returned. She left her only daughter alone. How Peeta was digging a grave for Prim yet there was no excitement of seeing the love of his life. How Katniss had children and a husband yet the past still haunted her instead of living out her life happy.<br /><br />These books made me addicted to the story of Katniss Everdeen and all the characters that were just as important.<br /><br />But the one thing that kept me going is Peeta and Gale. Now I'm not sure what made me so sad in the end. That Katniss chose Peeta? No, he came back to her. Or is it that Gale left her life knowing she would never love him. Either way, it's devestating to read the last chapter yet so amazing because I wish the story never ended the girl on fire. The mockingjay.

1609611543|5.0|This book desribes how our wheat has been changed since the 1970's and how poor it truly is for our overall health. We all need to demand that our farmers go back to the original wheat seeds and bring back the 4 to 5 foot amber waves of grain that we used to have here in the USA. Yes that's right, you'll notice if you live near wheat fields that the new modern wheat only grows 18 to 24 inches and is grossly undernourishing our bodies. This modern wheat is all about profit so let's quit buying it and instead purchase ancient or heirloom wheats and make our own bread until our farmers hear us.

Each sentence is a joy to read again and again.  This book will make you contemplate on life itself. The last 100 pages are really slow, but then the end hits you so you have to reflect on those seemingly slow pages. What a wonderful book.

1469984202|5.0|As a lifelong fan of good science fiction, the Wool series blindsided me from out of left field, and I've been seeing stars ever since.  This is incredibly good.  A masterfully written, utterly approachable, all-too-real scenario of a wildly far-fetched dystopic vision of not-too-distant future Earth.  Superb character development.. an elegant, well-balanced storyline.  The Wool series doesn't attempt to awe the reader with an overdose of bombastic grandeur.. rather, the reader is simply swept away by a really damn good story, plain and simple.  So very believable.  So very unbelievable.  Clear the calendar for a few days.. once you get started on Wool, you'll not be interested in much else until you've reached the final page.  Thank you, Hugh Howley, for reminding me why I love this genre so much.  Keep writing this stuff.. and don't ever stop.

I thought Last Action Hero was more fun than this book, and I'm not even an Arnold fan.  I will admit Charles Dance may have been what saved it.  But that's a different review.<br /><br />Redshirts is a fun read, but not the gem it could have been.

Use the forums ro rant about copy protection / digital copy / packaging, and leave the reviews to actual movie reviews.  Jeez!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a novel I never wanted to put down. I am a long time fan of sci-fi and fantasy, but Wool is something more. It is an invitation to a world and characters that are eminently enticing and that draw you in from the first book through the series. Hugh Howey is deserving of all the accolades this book has received. I just finished reading his novel and it is one of those rare books you wish you hadn't already read, so that you could read it again for the fist time.<br />This book is, simply put, a GREAT read. I enjoyed it beyond measure and will anxiously await his next offerings.<br />Ultimately, it is the characters and the twists that make the people of the Silo worth reading about. They build on one another and the ultimate tale in the book is linked together by each of them forming a piece of a chain that is intelligently and insightfully designed. It is likable, unpredictable and exciting as hell. Wool's pacing and editing are pitch perfect. It is the kind of novel where you find yourself concerned for the characters and stealing a few moments to find out what happens next; even when you don't have a few moments. Finally, the books illustrate the idea that some of our greatest shortcomings and fears are animated by our desire to do what we have been told is right, and little by little the author both undermines and supports this thesis, which leaves the reader to a rare thing, indeed. The reader is invited to think for themselves! This is perhaps the greatest of Howey's achievements and is alluded to, like many things in this novel, rather than a bludgeoning the reader with some seemingly profound and ultimate message from the writer. This novel is an achievement from an exciting new voice in fiction.

B0070NSPCU|3.0|Excellent characters, plot, setting. I enjoyed this book enough to want to read the next one. Liked the exploration of conflicting values, ethical ambiguities.<br /><br />I would urge the author to enlist an editor's help. There are problems with punctuation (its/it's, your/you're, nostrils/nostril's--and also with commas or lack thereof).  Also major problems with homonyms and spelling (fairing/faring, dumfounded/dumbfounded, seperately/separately, there/their, viscous/vicious, layed/laid, peel/peal, whither/wither, discrete/discreet, yolk/yoke).<br /><br />It was difficult reading long passages in italics; passages in italics indicating a different timeline. And I had trouble putting the events in the correct timeline order.<br /><br />At the end, one character shows another side of himself (I'm not being clear because I don't want to write a \\"spoiler\\")--it comes completely out of the blue for the protagonist, but the reader should have had some little indicators of his true nature along the way, so that the ending didn't seem so contrived.<br /><br />These drawbacks kept the novel from being a 4- or 5-star production.
B001TH16DI|5.0|ok completely honest review here.<br /><br />I only watched one movie from this set so far, that was #6 The Undiscovered Country, which is my favorite of entire series.  Since #6 is the last I expected the quality to be pretty good when transferred to Blu-Ray.  Wow!  I was blown away at how good the picture looked in Blu-Ray.  Actually it looked so good, you could see too much of the actor's make up at times.  My expectations are not high for #1 or #2 but I will update my review.  Still, I am very happy with the purchase.  If you are a regular guy who liked these movies, I think you'll be happy with the set.<br /><br />Update July 2, 2012:  Star Trek The Movie (#1) was not of Blu Ray quality but I did enjoy it.  The Wrath of Khan (#2) was much better.  I don't think #2 was 1080p but it seemed like it was upscaled by the DVD player.  I was impressed for a 1982 movie.  Again, very happy with the purchase overall.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless. It explains exactly who Adam Brown is.  He is a Navy SEAL in every sense of the words.  Adam was born and loved his home state of Arkansas.  He grew up in a loving home with an older brother and a twin sister.  Adam loved his brother and always looked up to him.  Adam however took a different path and turned to drugs and alcohol.<br /><br />This story is of him, climbing through the ashes and realizing his strength and love for his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  Adam found himself down and not able to go any further without someone's help.  He turned to Christ and began a slow process of finding his true identity and found redemption in Jesus.<br /><br />This story grips you and takes you in the deep dark spots of Adam Brown's life and brings you along as he finds his way in the Navy.  I really enjoyed this book and I suspect that you will as well. The author, Eric Blehm, has written this book wonderfully and I couldn't put it down. I truly would recommend this book to any and everyone, it was that great.  Its men like Adam Brown that make you step up in your life and wonder what you are doing with yours. Adam Brown was a brother in Christ, a faithful father, an adoring husband and an American.  Thank you to the men and women of the United States military.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review through their Blogging for Books program. I was not required to give a positive review.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is super fun! I loved it when I first found it on my friends Ipad and when I saw they had made on for the kindle fire I was so exited I clicked buy before looking at the price! And when I did see the price I was surprised that they would do that instead of making it exspensive! I'm so happy with this game I play it everyday.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Fun way to pass time when waiting for appointment, in airport, etc. would like more selection but those available will do fine for now. when I've finished free puzzles I may look at paying for app with more ops.

0393330435|4.0|\\"iWoz\\" is a fast, entertaining memoir by one of the true geniuses behind the 1970s home computer revolution. Highly recommended.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This chip is wonderful.  It is not only powerful and fast, but it also has Intel HD graphics embedded, so no need for a PCI Video card.  I am running it on an [[ASIN:B005PBJF6O Intel Desktop Board DZ68BC - BOXDZ68BC]]with [[ASIN:B004RFBIUU Corsair Vengeance Blue 16 GB DDR3 SDRAM Dual Channel Memory Kit CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9B]], and everything works great.  I Loaded Windows 7 Pro and it looks great on my 42\\" LG TV via HDMI.  Definitely a great processor, but be warned, if you try using an Intel mother board, it will have to have the BIOS flashed to 0035 since they come stock at 0028, so you will need another LGA1155 processor that is compatible to do it.  There are cheap ones on Amazon such as [[ASIN:B005M2HE0K G440 Cpu 1.60 Ghz 1M Cache]] just to get it flashed.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solid solitaire app, no complaints. But the ads are a little crazy. I understand that there will be some in a free app, but wow...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book largely due to the hype it received on a local radio station and a couple of other blurbs I heard on the news.  What a waste.  It's nothing more that a dopey romance novel with no real plot.  The sex scenes were no better than to be expected out of a romance novel, and I found the whole dominant/submissive thing to be way out of date.  It definitley doesn't leaving you hanging and wondering what's to come next.  If you're looking for something lame and cheesy to read this is it, if you're looking for a book with some substance and a plot don't waste your time.  I definitely won't be purchasing books 2 and 3 of the trilogy.
B0086700CM|5.0|the best game ive ever played for a kindle fire!! its an amazing and addicting game you should play it.
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Overall, a miss for me, story wise.<br />I do admit, I have never been a fan of Mr. Allen's movies. I just don't get them. They've never touched me, or moved me, or made any sense for me. I respect him as a business man though.<br />The story follow two young American women, best friends, as they to Barcelona, in a type of \\"coming of age\\" or \\"self discovery\\" time of their lives. And both are transformed slash exposed to other worlds and possibilities beyond their own. They have a chance, to change their path, forever.<br />The acting was good, incredible actors. Obviously, the story and characters fell way short for me. I'm not sure for me, I felt the characters were really pushed beyond their comfort zones, to the point where they changed. There was a lot of intellectualizing, which doesn't really do anything for me.<br />In the end, pretty much everything went back to the way it was, and no one seemed transformed by their experiences. If there is no transformation, what is the point of the movie?<br />I would not purchase this for my collection. Big surprise.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game if you love zombies and Gore. its awesome but that's my opinion.so I suggest. that you try it out.
B000006P8I|3.0|This is a weird album with some really embarrassing, albeit charming, moments. \\"There is a Happy Land\\"??? Whoa-- this is the same man would become the most cynical person in 1974-75? It reminds me of Marianne Faithfull; 60s folkies who were all love and peace, as was the time, and then got so disillusioned later on (I guess like the rest of society, post-Manson & Altamont)that they just radiated bitterness and cynicism.<br /><br />He is just straight-up goofy here. I think he was about 19 or so when he recorded it. He shows promise, and of course we know what a genius he became, but he seems a bit like Paul McCartney-- a supremely gifted person who really needs to be surrounded by the right people to check his daffier tendencies.<br /><br />The Laughing Gnome is one example of some kind of Syd Barret influence gone wrong. Terribly wrong. But it is amusing; I remember when I was an adolescent Bowie Worshipper, this one horrified me. I was so embarrassed for him. But now it's pretty funny. Post script: I see the Laughing Gnome is not on this release. It must be another re-release I'm thinking of. But if you are curious about Bowie's true youthful weirdness, check it out!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Costs extra for fonts and charges for updates. Be wary of apps that don't have clear costs. Developer needs to be more clear about prices.
B0044KU7EQ|5.0|I'm new to blues so I thought this box set would be a great way to get to know some blues and boy was I right. Recordings aren't the greatest but I didn't think the ones from the 1920's would be, that said it's a great box set, the box isn't the greatest for getting the cd's out but it works. If you are just getting into blues, I would highly recommend this box set.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am having a blast playing this, its a great and fun game. I recommend it for anyone of all ages
0062011847|3.0|I'm a HUGE Discworld fan.  I've read them multiple times, and own every one of them.  All of them, that is, except for Snuff.  Now, I was really looking forward to this book.  The copper books are my favorites, and Sam Vimes is by far my favorite character.  But there was something wrong about this book.  Other reviewers have mentioned it.  It didn't have the same tone, nor the same humor.  In fact, there was very little humor at all.  It rather felt like Pratchett had a different editor.  It also felt poorly translated.  Some people might say English is English, but there are many language and cultural differences between England and the US, and there were lots of things I didn't \\"get\\", and it seemed like it was because it was a cultural reference I wasn't familiar with.  This book also had fouler language than any of the others; language he only rarely if ever used was suddenly generously applied.<br /><br />But this isn't the first lackluster Discworld book he's written.  I've noticed this trend for awhile now.  It started with Monstrous Regiment.  But then Going Postal came out, which I loved, followed by Thud! which I LOVED.  Making Money went back to just being ok, and Unseen Academicals was blah.  But Snuff is the worst of all.  Others have mentioned that it's time for Pratchett to hang up his hat.  I regret that I must concur.  Whether it's due to Alzheimer's or that he's just lost his touch, I think it's time he laid down his pen.  I may end up giving Making Money and Unseen Academicals away, and end my collection on a high note.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is totally awesome! They should have this game for kinect. Temple Run, I love you. Finally, you are free :)
B007I2BZIE|1.0|I'm a huge Rush fan;  I've loved their music since I was a child.  I've rolled with their changes and still been a fan, though 70s and early 80s Rush is my favorite.<br /><br />I'd like to say that I liked the songs on this record, but the Mixing Engineer, Producer, or the Mastering Engineer (or a combination thereof) seems to be the main culprit that made this release sound so horrible.  I have listened to other bands Nick Raskulinecz has produced, and I have to say, of the one's I've heard whom he's worked with before, this would clearly be his worst production. I have a highly tuned, very sensitive car stereo where I do a lot of my listening.  I've listened to countless CDs, including most of Rush's CDs and know well how they should sound.  With this CD, I couldn't listen to more than one song... it was simply unlistenable!  The low end seems to be out of control and rumble comes across more than actual notes - the guitars get lost in the morass of drum and bass rumble, along with Geddy's voice.<br /><br />I recommend you download one song before buying the whole CD.  It might save you $10 to spend on another album that you'll enjoy far more.
B004QK5N5W|1.0|I wish that I had heeded all of the reviews from people who said that this adapter doesn't work. They were right. It is a complete waste of money.
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|This game is exactly like yooninja which I enjoyed that one better then this one but I guess it's still a bit addicting.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The Matrix is the best of the movies.  Video Quality is near perfect.  Sound Quality is exceptional.  It is definitely worth it to upgrade from DVD.  If you haven't, you are missing out.
B000002J2F|5.0|There are over one hundred reviews of this album (yes child, album. Its what we had in the 80s and i miss them) so i wont regurgitate the facts and commentary.<br />This is one of my personal all time favorite musical tours and I picture it in my mind, even from my first listening as a film.<br />What I saw was the life long relationship of 2 musicians. They met young, discovering each other thru the music. She (Duchess) became a big name Whitney type. Duke, he stayed in the background where he started. A session musician who transitioned into a sound engineer. As she rose in her ambitions Duchess left Duke behind. Eventually, on her rise to fame they were too far apart in every way.<br />The film would take place after Duchess' career had dissolved, but mostly follows Duke. Duchess now reduced to playing special occasions and nightclub shows. Obscure, the way almost all singers end up. Only memories. Duke has never lost his love for Duchess but her ambition has not waned as her career did. they try to reconnect but she is always distracted by talk of collaboration or even a comeback tour. He tries to be patient. Letting her come to him in her time, but broken dates and distance are still in the way.<br /><br />None of the songs would be in the movie. They would all be referenced through the dialogue and situations. In fact, I might not even have a musical score in the film. Instead, have bits of music playing through a radio nearby or from onstage while the film concentrates on action behind the curtain, or in studio, but a different room.<br />I had always seen Phil Collins as Duke. I really enjoy his acting the few rare times he has.<br />For Duchess thats trickier. I would think it would star a singer whose career may emulate Duchess' rise and fall and passion to not let go, but in the same age range as Phil.<br />Every time i listen to Duke I still see the film in my head, even now 30 years later.<br />According to the information I picked up about the creationof Duke only about 1/2 of it was conceived as a story with the rest including some of the top hits completely on their own. No matter, to me it all comes together; Hope, anguish, aspiration, sadness, inevitability.<br /><br />People connect,<br />fall away,<br />but inside somewhere remain connected.<br />Love can connect people for a lifetime even if the world stands between them til their deaths and after.<br /><br />I dont care about the albums pedigree or the trivial data of its creation. It is now and has always been one of my favorite musical distractions. Duke has given me hours of joy and contemplation.<br />thats what truly great music should do. creep inside you and never leave.
B0071R43MG|4.0|This is a great show. The band is playing with so much intensity and feeling. Satch's tone is better than ever. Important to mention, too, is that there are no excessive visual effects that tend to compete with the music. Everything is simple and true.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great little card game.  It's easy to play, loads quickly,  & works very well on the Kindle Fire.  I would recommend this game.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I ordered this headset with the thought in my mind that it would make my soft voice a bit louder, and cut out the incredibly loud children in my house, making tons of background noise. well this didn't happen, and I am now the background noise.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Being able to call the color out instead of a name or description is a benefit I didn't even think about when purchasing.  I also enjoy the fact that they keep the head up and off of the counter when resting.  Would buy again.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I fail to understand the hype about this book, unless there is a significant amount of unfulfilled women out there reading it. It is decently written but let's be honest for just a moment - a virgin and over-the-top successful super-hot guy with major emotional issues and a penchant for submissives? Gee that's not a recipe for disaster. Bottom line:  If you enjoy unrealistic scenarios and porn (reading this is literally like watching a porn video)then this is your book.  If you're like me and long for a book with complex characters and plot that doesn't stoop to people screwing (literally) 5 times a day then this isn't for you.  What a waste.
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy, I must say I am NOT one for non fiction books, especially erotic fiction. I heard mixed reviews about it and decided I would read the book myself. I fell in love with them. I could not put the books down and had them finished in 3 weeks. A lot of people complain about the repetition, and yes there is a lot of it. However. I think E L James allows the repetition because this is what makes the characters. For example \\"rolling eyes\\" \\"long index finger\\". This book is not for everyone I understand that, go into the books with an open mind. It is a delightful trilogy. This book is not for the young or the close minded. Lighten up. It's on the NY Times best sellers list for a reason. Another thing.. This book says \\"EROTIC ROMANCE\\" right on the back!!!!!!! So anyone who says it is porn or degrading to women can calm down, what did you think you were getting into? Get real. Oh and to the Twihards, calm down. It is not fan fiction, and if it were get over it.. E L James was published, your precious fan fiction wasn't.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. awesome work guys keep up the good work! it is similar to the original Mario brothers which is extra cool.
1400069289|3.0|Duhigg came out of the blocks with some compelling insights and chapters.  After the first few chapters he couldn't seem to keep his focus.<br /><br />People have habits.  We can over-write new patterns to create new habits which still reward us.  (Good.)<br /><br />Organizations have routines.  The patterns can be over-written there, too.  (Also good.)  I liked the contrast of habit to routine.<br /><br />After these well developed ideas Duhigg made the mistake of \\"cramming a 200 page book into 400 pages.\\"  Coaches, trainers and counselors can still probably get good use from the first half of the book....
B00004Z459|5.0|I bought this album 12 years ago... back when I was in 8th grade. Linkin Park had just come out and was standing alongside groups like Papa Roach and Limp Bizkit.  While my music tastes have certainly grown and changed some through the years, I still revisit this album fondly and would definitely say it is one of my favorite albums of all time.<br /><br />One reason for this is that I absolutely LOVE every track on this CD.  When I was younger, I didn't have much patience for listening to albums all the way through, but I would listen to this one over, and over, and over again.  Chester's unique voice alongside Mike's rap and the passion they put into what they were singing just really spoke to me and still does.  None of the songs felt like they a \\"filler\\" feel.<br /><br />Of course, I enjoyed all the radio hits -- \\"One Step Closer,\\" \\"Crawling,\\" and \\"In the End.\\" But some of the gems I found to be the lesser known tracks -- especially \\"Forgotten,\\" \\"With You,\\" and \\"Papercut.\\" My least favorite song was \\"Cure for the Itch,\\" but I still like even that one enough that I wouldn't skip over it. While I do enjoy \\"Pushing Me Away,\\" I have to admit this is one song that I actually liked better on their second release -- Reanimation. Don't get me wrong, the original version on this album is fantastic, but I found the second release more captivating. It was especially good released live.<br /><br />I haven't listened to a whole ton of the rap/metal or rapcore genres, but from what I have listened to, Linkin Park stands out... and this album specifically, REALLY stands out. Each song is fantastic on its own, and I don't hear them falling into the trap of starting to sound like the same old song over and over again presented in \\"different\\" ways.<br /><br />Their voices still can bring a chills to my spine and their words challenge you to think -- I find them very discussion worthy! If you're a fan of modern rock/alternative or rapcore from the late '90s and early 2000s, this album is a must-have.

0374203032|2.0|Sandel is a teacher of ethics and justice. The author makes the subject come alive, but at the cost of remaining on a simplistic level. The author is not really a deep thinker and that shows in this book. The moral limits of markets deserves a much more scholarly treatment than a bunch of examples appealing to a sense of justice. The book has a left-wing slant which I find unfortunate because nothing is wrong with objectivity. The converted will love the book and the right-wing will find it annoying. Please note that I am talking about style only. With a more neutral language, there would be no way for the right-wing to find the book annoying. They would have to engage with the subject topic instead. Sadly this book will now only be read by do-good left-wing people.<br /><br />Not directly similar, but if you want to read a book on ethics and the political left and right, I would advice you to check out the five start book [[ASIN:0307377903 The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion]].

I wish I could scream from the mountain tops to everyone I know about how much I LOVED this series!  If you love to read or are a light reader it does not matter you MUST read this series!  I am 33 yrs old and the fact that this series is YA never even crossed my mind while reading it. I laughed out loud, I cried lots of tears and I felt a large realm of many other emotions reading this series. It was touching, heartbreaking, hilarious, moving, full of intense love and more than anything it captivated my soul!  The poetry was amazing and the characters were so well developed. It was like I was watching a movie in my mind as I read the words on the pages. I never highlight or mark pages in books, but this one I did!! So much beautiful poetry that I wanted to remember and go back to. If you have any doubt about reading this book PLEASE just take a chance on it you will NOT be disappointed! THANK YOU Colleen Hoover for writing such an AMAZINGLY beautiful story, it was a gift and a pleasure to read! (Book 2 is Point of Retreat)

0393088774|1.0|As David Gordon stated in Mises.org, supporters of Keynesian economics sometimes claim it to be a crude caricature of the Master that he thought the government has only to spend more money to get us out of a depression and that getting us into debt doesn't matter because we owe it to ourselves. Keynes, it is alleged, was a vastly more sophisticated thinker than this caricature portrays him to be. These defenders may find End This Depression Now! disconcerting. Krugman, who whatever his faults certainly is not lacking in technical sophistication, defends pretty much the cartoon version of Keynesianism that we are told is oversimplified.<br /><br />He makes unmistakably clear the lesson he intends to convey: the government needs to spend a great deal of money to extricate us from our depressed economic conditions.<br /><br />  But the essential point is that what we really need to get out of this current depression is another burst of government spending. Is it really that simple? Would it really be that easy? Basically, yes. (p. 39)<br /><br />To those who worry that spending on the scale he has in mind would add to the already huge government deficit, he says,<br /><br />  It's true that people like me believe that the depression we're in was in large part caused by the buildup of household debt, which set the stage for a [Hyman] Minsky moment in which highly indebted households were forced to slash their spending. How, then, can even more debt be part of the appropriate policy response? The key point is that this argument against deficit spending assumes, implicitly, that debt is debt -- that it doesn't matter who owes the money. Yet that can't be right; if it were, we wouldn't have a problem in the first place. After all, to a first approximation debt is money we owe to ourselves; yes, the United States has debt to China and other countries, but ... our net debt to foreigners is relatively small and not the heart of the problem. (p. 146)<br /><br />Why does Krugman favor increased government spending? After the collapse of the housing market and the bank and investment house failures that accompanied this collapse, consumers' spending fell. Faced with the prospect of diminished spending by consumers, investors were reluctant to invest. Unless the government acted, the economy threatened to spiral downward. Government aid programs and actions by the Fed prevented total collapse, but spending has not been sufficient. The government needs to do more. \\"Why is unemployment so high, and economic output so low? Because we -- where by 'we' I mean consumers, businesses, and governments combined -- aren't spending enough\\" (p. 24).<br /><br />One might at first object to Krugman's argument in this way. If the government spends more but does not increase the supply of money, must it not be the case that someone else has spent less money? In this view, there cannot be an overall failure of demand. More of particular goods can be produced than people want at the price they are offered for sale, but there cannot be general overproduction.<br /><br />Krugman rejects this counterposition. \\"This is the fallacy Keynes called 'Say's Law'\\" (p. 25).<br /><br />What is wrong with Say's law, in brief, is that money need not be either spent or invested. People can hoard money; and, if they do so, a failure in total demand can indeed result. Surprisingly, he does not offer a detailed account of how hoarding produces this failure in total demand. \\"You can write down a little mathematical model to illustrate the issues, but this works only with economists, not with normal human beings (and it doesn't even work with some economists)\\" (p. 26). Instead, he supports his criticism of Say's law with a story that he has already used in his The Return of Depression Economics. The story is about a babysitting cooperative, the members of which find themselves at cross-purposes.<br /><br />I do not propose to rehearse here the details of Krugman's babysitting example and its relevance to the case of economic depression.[1] Let us instead look at the Keynesian analysis directly. Does it rest on plausible assumptions? What evidence supports it?<br /><br />It will come as no surprise to readers that the Keynesian account strikes me as unpersuasive. For one thing, as Krugman himself acknowledges, the depression starts with the collapse of particular markets such as housing. If this is so, why are investors supposed to fear a general fall in future consumer demand? Is not the problem rather that there has been malinvestment in specific areas? The solution would then be to shift resources away from these areas into others. So long as this is done, why would businessmen refuse to invest?<br /><br />Krugman is aware of this response, but he believes it is just what we need to avoid. He cites Joseph Schumpeter, who warned against policies of government stimulus to end depressions. Instead, bad investments should be left to fail:<br /><br />  For any revival which is merely due to artificial stimulus leaves part of the work of depressions undone and adds, to an undigested remnant of maladjustment, new maladjustment of its own which has to be liquidated in turn, thus threatening business with another crisis ahead. (p. 204, quoting Schumpeter)<br /><br />Krugman does not tell us what is wrong with Schumpeter's reasoning. Instead, he takes for granted that investors in a depression expect a general collapse in consumers' demand.<br /><br />But suppose, contrary to fact, that investors did expect a general fall in consumer demand. Would it follow that investment would stop, miring the economy in continuing depression? By no means. As Friedrich Hayek noted long ago, investment in a business can be profitable even if demand for the product of the industry has fallen. What concerns the businessman is not the quantity of his product that buyers demand at a given price, considered in isolation, but rather that amount compared with his costs.If his costs have also fallen, why cannot investment continue?<br /><br />As Hayek says,<br /><br />  As it is not the absolute level of the prices of the product, but only their relative level in comparison with factor prices which determines the remunerativeness of production, it is, therefore, never the absolute size of the demand for consumption goods, but the relative size of the demands for the means of production to be used for the various methods of producing consumption goods that determines this relative profitableness.[2]<br /><br />Krugman might respond to our objections in this way: \\"You may cavil at various details of Keynes, but the evidence demonstrates that he is right. Government spending does indeed revive prosperity and create jobs.\\"<br /><br />Does not this response ignore the obvious? The government under Bush and Obama has spent a great deal of money; but, on Krugman's own showing, the economy has failed fully to recover. Does this not give us some reason to think that the Keynesian prescription is inadequate? Krugman does not think so. He says the problem with current American policy is that the government has not spent enough. Further, he says, he does not here speak with the wisdom of hindsight. He warned long ago that the amount of money the government proposed to spend would not suffice to bring about recovery.<br /><br />  I personally was more or less tearing my hair out in public as the shape of the [Obama] administration's plan began to come clear.... I feared that an inadequate stimulus would both fail to produce adequate recovery and undermine the political case for further action. (p. 119)<br /><br />In cases where a correlation exists between government spending and increases in employment, he awards full marks to Keynes:<br /><br />  As military spending [in 1940] created jobs and family incomes rose, consumer spending also picked up (it would eventually be restrained by rationing, but that came later). As businesses saw their sales growing, they also responded by ramping up spending. And just like that, the Depression was over. (p. 39)[3]<br /><br />Krugman does not so much as mention the pioneering work of Robert Higgs, Depression, War, and Cold War, which decisively challenges the contention that World War II ended the Great Depression. Higgs convincingly shows that prosperity returned only after the war ended. But let us, very much contrary to fact, suppose that Krugman is correct about the effects of government spending in the years after 1940. His defense of Keynes would still be grossly deficient.<br /><br />What he is in effect saying is this: \\"Instances that appear to confirm the claim that government spending ends depressions count in favor of Keynes. But cases that go against Keynes do not count, because we cannot rule out the possibility that greater spending would have worked.\\"<br /><br />What Keynes's friend Piero Sraffa, who cannot be suspected of bias in favor of the Austrian School, wrote in his copy of Keynes's General Theory applies to Krugman as well: \\"as usual, heads I win, tails you lose.\\"[4]<br /><br />One passage in the book is unintentionally revealing. Given Krugman's stress on the importance of propping up investment through government stimulus, one might have expected him to favor measures to boost business confidence. Instead, he cites with approval the Polish Marxist Michal Kalecki, who warned that appeals to business confidence were an instrument by which the capitalist class endeavored to control policy. Government should not placate business but instead control the economy directly:<br /><br />  Every widening of state activity is looked upon by business with suspicion, but the creation of employment by government spending has a special aspect which makes the opposition particularly intense. Under a laissez-faire system the level of employment depends to a great extent on the so-called state of confidence.... This gives the capitalists a powerful indirect control over government policy; everything which may shake the state of confidence must be carefully avoided because it would cause an economic crisis. But once the government learns the trick of increasing employment by its own purchases, this powerful controlling device loses its effectiveness. (pp. 94-5, quoting Kalecki)<br /><br />Krugman remarks, \\"This sounded a bit extreme to me the first time I read it, but it now seems all too plausible\\" (p. 95).<br /><br />Krugman yearns for the glory that was Roosevelt and the grandeur that was Truman, but he evidently thinks that their revolution against capitalism needs to proceed further.<br /><br />Krugman has nothing to say about the Austrian theory of the business cycle. Hayek is mentioned once (p. 205) in connection with the passage from Schumpeter previously quoted, but his name does not appear in the book's index. Mises and Rothbard are not mentioned at all. Given his manifest lack of understanding of the Austrian theory in earlier work, this is just as well.[5]<br /><br />Notes<br /><br />[1] I have elsewhere discussed the babysitting cooperative and Krugman's use of it.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is apart of my bed time routine! Fun &amp; easy to play &amp; occupies my down time. love this game/app!!
B007P3TMW2|3.0|I found that this movie was entertaining enough to watch all the way through. It was even touching at times but overall it felt contrived, not quite believable.
0307352145|2.0|As I read through \\"Part One: The Extrovert Ideal,\\" I thought I had a winner. I thought I had a book that I was going to be able to say to all of you out there that are introverts and writers (because most actual writers are introverts (and I say it that way to exclude people (celebrities) who \\"write\\" books but don't really do the actual writing)), \\"You need to read this book!\\" But, as it turns out, I was wrong.<br /><br />So what happened? Well, Susan Cain (the author) did. As it turns out, she wasn't really interested in introversion, she was actually interested in why she was afraid of public speaking. As many people do, she tied the fear of public speaking to her introversion. It's a great stereotype, right? Introverts are scared to speak in public? Except that it's wrong. Numerous studies have shown that fear of public speaking has nothing to do with introversion. Extroverts have the same fear of public speaking that introverts have. Meaning, if you're scared of getting up in front of people and giving a speech, you are just as likely to be an extrovert as an introvert (possibly more likely, because we think extroverts make up a larger portion of society). The initial section, the research about extroverts and the rise of our extroverted society is quite good and interesting (but it's not worth buying the whole book). It's where the actual, objective research happened.<br /><br />After that, though... well, it begins an exploration of why she's still scared of public speaking even though she's been doing it for years.<br /><br />She starts with biology and how much of introversion may be nature and how much nurture. Some of that is also interesting, especially the newer studies focused on children that are trying to differentiate the nature/nurture debate. However, as she went on, she relied more and more on \\"maybe\\"s and \\"might\\"s rather than actual data. Because there was no solid data to back up any of the claims she wanted to make, so she relied on speculationto make her points. Sometimes, it was her own speculation. And I don't have a problem with speculating, but I do have an issue with speculation being presented as evidence.<br /><br />The other thing she did was to rely heavily on anecdotal evidence, \\"I heard a story once...,\\" to prove her points. That's just as bad as speculation. I mean, it's the same as me saying \\"one time, this friend of mine found a dead cow in the woods with all of its organs removed\\" to prove that aliens exist. Or that aliens target cows because they like cheese (yes, Briane, that was for you). At one point, she even uses a story Mark Twain told. Really? Because he was know for his non-fiction?<br /><br />The worst part, though, is that she over-generalized her own brand of introversion as being what all introverts are like, and that's just not true. The introvert/extrovert thing is not something that's cut and dried like that. It's known as the introvert/extrovert spectrum, and it's called that for a reason. But she very happily lumped all introverts into her specific type of introversion, and my own introversion is nothing like hers. For one thing, I don't have a problem with public speaking. At all. I spent years and years getting up in front of people and talking, and the only time I ever had an issue with it was 5th grade, the first time I had to give an oral book report. She also equates introversion with shyness, which is also not true. Shyness, like fear of public speaking, is not something that only introverts lay claim to. Again, shyness is something that falls across the introvert/extrovert spectrum. [At one point, she does, kind of, say this, but, then, she goes on talking about it and discussing it as if it was a purely introvert issue.] But she was a shy child; therefore, all introverts must be shy.<br /><br />If the book had continued to focus on society (as in the first section) and how introverts can make a place for themselves in a society that holds up extroversion as theideal (by the way, the US is one of the most extroverted societies on the planet), as the full title suggests, it would have been a good read. However, it really just goes offtrack and explores how introverts can get over their fear of public speaking (because, you know, that's the assumption, that all introverts are scared of this). In short, it becomes a self help book, and I really wasn't looking for a self help book (nor was it marketed as one). I mean, really, she spends probably 1/3 of the book dealing with strategies and studies and plans about how to get over the fear of public speaking. It was like a big bait-and-switch.<br /><br />At the very end (for, maybe, 5 pages), she did talk about the issue of children that are introverts in classrooms designed for extroverts, and that was interesting, but it's the kind of thing that really could have benefited from a closer look. It has to do with how, as a society, we mess up our kids by trying to get them to be one way (an extrovert) when they're not. It's the equivalent of forcing left-handed kids to write with their right hands; it's just not so visual. [And this issue of the extrovert designed class is pretty much everywhere I guess. Desks arranged in \\"pods\\" so that students can work together instead of individually. That's prevalent at my kids' school, too, so that was an eye opener that that's what that's about.]<br /><br />Anyway, unless you have a fear of public speaking and need to do it, I would just skip this book. I wish I had. I dislike finishing a book frustrated at the lack of information the author actually gave.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have read hundreds of book. I actually have a library in my house and this is the first book that I've ever finished and immediately re-read in its entirety. Okay, it's not a master stroke of literary genius that demands historical context and advanced literacy. However, the turbulent relationships and characters really drew me in. Also, it was a quick read so, re-reading it was quick easy and enjoyable. Something about the Travis character really, really engaged me. I don't believe I've ever written a review, but I just finished reading parts of the book for a third time and felt like I owed it to the author to give a nod to this book. Had lots of good plot points and complicated characters, but wasn't overly intricate or complicated. Really, really enjoyable read. Really. Honestly, I would never have read this, but I just got a Kindle... Discovering the book changed my mind about returning the Fire. I'm keeping it.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|I love this album! Every track is beautifully captivating and so well written. In my mind this recording tells a wonderful story. Moreover, there is such variation that this album will stand the test of time. I think John Kelman of Allthatjazz sums-it-up great when he ends with the following: \\"In a career now nearing the four-decade mark, with so many truly classic albums, beginning with his very first, Bright Size Life (ECM, 1975) and leading up to what will surely be considered another career highpoint in Unity Band, Metheny continues to move from strength to strength. Even when a recording like Orchestrion generates no small amount of controversy, this all-encompassing, stylistically voracious guitarist continues to prove that, for him, it's all a process of discovery, evolution and occasionally revolution. For those who miss Pat Metheny Group, Unity Band may not be the solution; but in its combination of detailed writing, instrumental orchestration and unfettered, energetic blowing, it's an alternative that, in its blending of form and freedom, is unequivocally one of Metheny's finest--an album that's sure to find its way to \\"best of\\" lists for 2012 and, no doubt, another nomination when the Grammy Awards roll around again, to perhaps round him up to an even--and, in the world of jazz, unprecedented--twenty wins.\\"

B0038W0OIK|3.0|So, i'm the guy that always uses the $10 headsets.  This was my first expensive one.  Sad to say I saw little difference in it. Its really nice upgrade though from ear plugs. But, the audio is EH. I expected better personally. The best feature of this headset to me is the noise canceling.  They also feel very nice.  My concern about this headset though is durability.  I read that the headband breaks after awhile.  I can certainly see that happening to mine.  Oh well. My cyber acoustic headset lasted about five years? maybe.  Lets see how long this one lasts. Also, I got this headset because I saw Demuslim from Team EG using it and it looked pretty nifty.<br />Also, mic seems to pick everything up but my voice. lol

1469984202|5.0|I love trying new things, new foods as restaurants, new TV shows, new authors, and so forth, but I have to be honest, I'm usually disappointed.  As I've gotten a little older I realize I've tried a lot of stuff, and I pretty much know what I like and don't at this point.  Despite that, I continue to challenge myself with the \\"new\\" because every once in a while I discover some new band, food, or book that makes it all worthwhile.  Hugh Howey's Wool is one of those gems.<br /><br />This story (the Wool 1-5 collection) does so many things well I'd be embarrassed to just gush all over it so I'm going to single out a couple of things that I think help make it so special.  First, the pacing of the story is just perfect.  Many stories will leave a 'hook' in at the end of a chapter that makes you eager to get on to the next one, but with Wool it was more well crafted than that. I couldn't wait to find out what was going to be on the next page, and many times it was a struggle not to glance down ahead at the next couple paragraphs to see what was going to happen, it really was that engaging.<br /><br />The second quality I want to call out is the way the story subverts your expectations.  You think things are going one way, or even better, that you have read the clues identified the red herrings and puzzled out what is going to happen, but are then completely surprised by what actually takes place.  And this is done in a such a way that the whole thing isn't all about a \\"twist\\" or big \\"reveal\\".  The surprises you find aren't the point of it all, they're organic in the way they're just part of a great overall story.<br /><br />Buy this book, read this book, you won't be disappointed.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is kinda awesome. I like all the features and upgrades. so dope and keeps me playing for hours.
B005OLUOVA|4.0|This is Pricey but then it is a work of Art.<br />If you love Rammstein, you MUST buy this product. It's arty and well done. It includes every video the band has ever done ,plus a making of segment for each one. The only problems is it leaves you wanting more. Some notes:<br />DVD's good quality plays on an PS3 with no issues ( USA ) . Some caveats,I would of liked to have had a complete list of all the actors and crew along with locations of the filming and the uncensored versions, also would of liked to have had the 'full' version of Sonne (starts without the countdown), but on the plus side, the sound Quality is good and the menu is simple to use and hey, you have ALL the videos.<br />CD-one  Good combination of hit's, -but if you are buying this then already have all the albums so this is the only questionable item -may be seen as filler instead of a good CD mix/retrospective.<br />CD-two  Fun remixes for some of their tunes. Scooter's remix of Pussy is especially good.<br />Booklet- Very well done,high quality paper and finish, lots of new photos  - only wish it would of been larger,perhaps a fold out ?<br />Cross shaped Cloth Rammstein Napkin- Clever and arty as well as useful in protecting the cd's from rust<br />Metal case - Arty and Clever -good example of the famous German design ethos.<br /><br />Like I said, this is a MUST for true Fans of the Band. Lovers of the Music only ,can be happy with downloads and or the individual albums.<br /><br />I must admit I heard warning of mistakes involving quality and duplication/omissions of discs, but fortunately none were encountered with my purchase. I would like to think the Rammstein organization would be happy to correct any mistakes but i have no proof to back up this assumption.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy Amazon made this product available and that I was able to avoid having to convert Dollars to Euros. Even if i had to wait many months, if your debating waiting for the price to come down don't risk itbuy now before it is gone or becomes too overpriced.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It is important to take this book for what it is:  a simply written hot, steamy guilty pleasure.  It is nothing more and nothing less.  It's that simple! It will never be considered a great piece of literature, and I don't think it is was ever supposed to be.  Reading this is a brainless exercise - you don't have to think too hard! It is adult guilty pleasure at its best.

B0076D21O2|3.0|I picked up \\"Anonymous\\" as an afterthought, having failed to find any other recent releases that looked appealing. The dvd cover called it a \\"cloak-and-dagger\\" mystery about the possible identity of William shakespeare, set in \\"the political snakepit of Elizabethian England\\". I'm not overly interested in Elizabethian England, but I'm willing to give most movies a shot if the jacket has more than one good review on it. Ebert called it \\"splendid\\"; another critic said it \\" bursts with energy, wit, and drama\\". Were it not for these accolades, I would have overlooked what is probably one of the most interesting movies released last year.<br /><br />My basic review: A great story, well-written, with top-notch actors, (Vanessa Redgrave is Queen), lush sets and beautiful period costumes.<br />Warning: if you're looking for entertainment, this is not an easy film. The first time around I drifted off. By the end of the movie I had only a vague idea of what was going on. I had to watch it twice, and really concentrate the second time, to even begin to understand the complex and deeply layered plot.<br /><br />One of my biggest problems with Royal Court dramas is the use of titles in addition to names; Robert the So-and-So is also the Earl of Such-and Such. There are at least a half a dozen titled major characters to keep track of.<br />Add to that a complicated, non-chronological timeline that spans more than 40 years. Amidst the action, (and there's plenty), flash-backs and forwards occur frequently and without warning; the viewer has to really focus to keep up. I had a lot of difficulty keeping track of who was who; Is the young Queen the same Queen as the older Queen shown at the beginning of the film, or another Queen altogether? The elderly Earl looks nothing like the younger Earl, but he does look exactly like his son the Earl. (At least I think they're father and son. I'm pretty sure they were the same actor. You'll see what I mean if you watch the movie.)<br /><br />I have the dvd for 24 hours, so I'm going to watch it again. I don't mind, I enjoy a really demanding film.<br />If you prefer easier entertainment, and are drawn to Shakespeare and the Royal Court, I'd recommend \\"[[ASIN:B000RHLY7O Stage Beauty]]\\", one of my all-time favorite movies. I'm hoping to put \\"Anonymous\\" on that list, but I'll have to study it a bit more first.<br />Great watch for the serious film or Shakespeare buff.<br /><br />Final note: I did watch this a third time, and still find the timeline confusing. I'd hoped the pleasure of watching it would improve with successive viewings, but it stayed about the same. I have to give it 3 stars instead of my original 4. I think this film was a great idea that would have made a much better film had its makers subscribed to the less-is-more school of filmmaking. It might even benefit from some rigorous editing.

Adam Brown's larger than life adventure serve to remind us that anyone can fall but not everyone gets back up.<br /><br />Adam's story starts in a small Arkansas town and takes him to the mountains of Afghanistan.  His loving wife, Kelley,  stands beside him and they fight to carve out a life and place for their family.  Adam and Kelley journey through BUDs, medical issues from injuries sustained during deployment, and drug addiction.  This book spares no detail as Adam wanted it to be faithful to his life.  I find the humility and grace that the Brown family shows to be amazing.<br /><br />To allow the most intimate details of Adam's struggle to be revealed does not tarnish his reputation but enhances God's reputation for fixing broken people who need Him.<br /><br />Adam's story carries true heroics to the ends of the earth.  However, its humanity shows each of us what we can be when we trust God.  Adam was a warrior no doubt.  But his identity as a child of God defined him in ways that are unimaginable.<br /><br />SEALs leave no man behind.  As the church, we cannot leave any man behind.  A man is a male who rejects passivity and accepts responsibility for his life because of his relationship with God.  Adam not only lived up to that definition of manhood.  He left behind a legacy for all men who want to know God and follow Him fearlessly.<br /><br />You just finished reading a book review of Fearless for Processofbecoming.net.

0142421375|4.0|One is surprised to find a John Grisham in the kids section of the library. In my case, as a matter of fact, the young kids section. I, personally, think some of the themes in this series are too old for the book to sit next to 'Mrs. Pigglewiggle' and the like. At one point, after all, our hero seems as if he is about to be asked to go down and identify the decomposed body of his 13 yo female friend. Hardly Bobbsey Twins stuff!<br /><br />This series seems to suffer from ending difficulties. So far each of the books I have read wimp out at the end. We find (warning: spoilers) our girl. Yeah. But we hardly have to do anything to get her back. The hero's mom offers to be her guardian. Yeah. But then she just sort of stays with her repentant mother and father. Really? Not adopted by our hero's mother and the two have to begin life as step siblings?<br /><br />All in all an interesting series, which I recommend. But I think Grisham can do better.
B0083L1IW2|4.0|If you're familiar with Circus Maximus after two albums then you're probably expecting more of the same.  While it's here it's not here as well.  By way of the first track they let out of the bag to listen to you could tell that this album would deliver more in the melodic rock vein.  And this might be because of Michael Eriksen roaming off and due some melodic rock with The Magnificents which I find to be an excellent AOR album.  With that said, while I love progressive rock I wouldn't expect any group to keep on repeating subsequent albums and this is no different with Circus Maximus.  There are still plenty of progressive moments here, but as another reviewer already stated it might lean towards the pop side a little more than some fans want.  For me, I can listen to this and thoroughly enjoy it and not get wrapped up in what their 3rd album was or should have sounded like.  Overall, a decent album, but five years a little long of a wait to keeps the fans lingering.
0525425764|4.0|One is surprised to find a John Grisham in the kids section of the library. In my case, as a matter of fact, the young kids section. I, personally, think some of the themes in this series are too old for the book to sit next to 'Mrs. Pigglewiggle' and the like.<br /><br />The book itself was definitely Grisham lite; as befits a kids book. The very best kids books rise above this flaw, but it is an understandable one. YA and kids books often leave one wondering what the book would be like as an adult book, with the characters, plot, and details all fleshed out.<br /><br />The accused is an interesting twist. The series seems to focus on our hero, along with the normal teenage angst and Disneyesque 'I can never accomplish anything except when being disobedient', being 'the star of the show'... the kind of invincible and unimpeachable hero that, with adult suave and knowledge, helps the poor pitiful other kids out of their dilemmas. Thus it was very interesting to see him not only vulnerable, but confused, lost, and accused... at least for a time by the more minor and stupider characters.<br /><br />The ending was, for me, disappointing. It is always hard when the 'bad guys' turn out to be someone you don't really know and didn't really care about. And then to find them actually the victims as well makes the whole thing less than satisfying. Several threads were left untied at the end as well.<br /><br />All in all I would recommend it, but I think that if Grisham wants to write YA, Grisham can do better than this.

B000024MKV|4.0|Most of us melodic rock fans know, 1996 was not an ideal time to release an album if you sounded anything like bands from the 80's. Fortunatly for all of us, Gotthard never recieved the memo, and went on to release one of the best melodic rock albums of the 90's.<br /><br />With the release of \\"G\\", Gotthard unveiled a slightly more mature sound. While the melodic/party rock element is still on the forefront, the songwriting and overall feel of the record are a little different from previous albums. That being said, we all know that these guys simply don't release bad records, and \\"G\\" is not exception. Steve Lee's voice is still amazing as usual, Leo Leoni's guitar plaing and writing is over-the-top as always and the rythym section is tight as a bank teller's cash drawer. One of the biggest treats of this record to my ears is the amazing covers of \\"The Mighty Quinn\\"(Bob Dylan) and \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\"(The Hollies), the originals are good and all, but Gotthard take these tracks out of the park. Other favorites are \\"Sister Moon\\", \\"Sweet Little R&R\\" and \\"Lay Down The Law\\", but like I said earlier, every song is listenable.<br /><br />Just go buy this release. You have read several reviews, heard the snippets, even watched the videos, trust me it's worth the couple bucks you pay for it. You won't be disappointed.

1469984202|5.0|I was skeptical about this novel when I found it on amazon, simply because it was self-published.  There is an image that exists for some, that a self-published novel is just that, because no intelligent publisher would dare touch what he or she deemed poor material.  Mind you, my fears seemed to be proven true during the first fifty pages, as I was somewhat bored by the love story between the elderly deputy and the silo's mayor.  Yet, by the time this love story reached its peak and other factors came into play, I was taken by the story.  I was smitten, if such a word can be used to describe the rest of the tale.  I love books such as this.  It was a cross between Stephen King and Aldous Huxley. King because of the fear, Huxley because of the philosophical dilemma they all faced, and the bad trip that those \\"in the know\\" were confronted with.  I won't delve into the plot or analyze the story in depth, as this is not a review.  It is a compliment to a very original story.  It can be difficult to create an original post-apocalyptic story, as there is much to be imagined, and most of the obvious possibilities that might occur in such a world have been previously explored by other authors.  I'll be following the career of this author closely in the future. Great read.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another number 1 by David Baldacci.  Hopefully, there will be more books featuring \\"Will\\" as the main character.  I was expecting Oliver Stone to appear somewhere in the book but in the end, did not miss him at all.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Perfect cover for my Amazon Fire. Love the stand up feature. Lightweight, durable and protects my Kindle from nicks and scratches. Would recommend.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Modern women should know how to pursue what we want while cultivating a full, independent life.  Shame on you, E.L. James for creating such a sophomoric, ridiculous, wet blanket (\\"do you think he really likes me?\\") as opposed to an empowered, strong woman who can enjoy her sexuality, get what she wants, and have some self-respect.
1400069289|2.0|As some others have noted, this book begins very promisingly and presents a nice, succinct view of habits and how they are formed. However, after the first couple of chapters the content becomes very diffuse and, usually, completely unrelated to the original view of habits. As a whole, the book is simply incoherent and doesn't tie together. I was very disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it's a great app with great games. I've been playing whenever I get a spare moment this last week and I think it's clever idea the way it's set up.... a great time waster!!!

B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I confess to being spoiled by such greats as Michael Crawford (not to mention all time favorite Colm Wilkinson) in the original Phantom productions and audio CD set.  I have also watched the Emmy Rossom movie version many times.  I was looking forward to the sequel of Phantom, but had not listened to the soundtrack or read much about it before I purchased this dvd.<br /><br />So.  The production was spectacular.  The music themes, the sets, amazing.  I wish it had been more of a \\"movie version\\" as opposed to a live theatre version (with applause) because that was distracting.  Having said that, if they had to do a recorded theatre production, why couldn't they have done one in, for example, London?  With more \\"known\\" actors?  I did not know anyone in this production, did not particularly care for the singing, and by the way, in my opinion, the Meg character completely stole the show.  She was lovely, and incredibly enjoyable to watch and listen to.<br /><br />Well, I am not complaining, not trying to tred on any Australian toes :-).  If you liked Phantom of the Opera, chances are great that you will also enjoy watching this dvd!
1589949811|5.0|I have been a fan of LOTR forever, I've played Decipher's LotR TCG, so getting this was inevitable. First off, I love the coop capability. Makes for a fun and friendly experience with friends, even on their first time through. The artwork is great and the gameplay is original. It can be difficult to remember all the rules and little things when playing alone. The core set provides a fun experience on it's own, but you probably won't be able to stop yourself from getting some expansions, and like other people said, maybe another core set. I'm personally waiting on the second core set till I get caught up on the released expansions, and even then I only plan on buying one, because the third one only finishes out a few cards, that although powerful, most are unique or so expensive that having 3 would be impractical. Whilst playing by yourself is fun, playing coop is way better. Overall, it is worth the $25 if you are looking for a mentally stimulating, flavorful, fun game.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Ok this film isn't James Cameron's Titanic but it's pretty damn good. The characters played by Michael Fassbender and Charlize theron were particularly well played. I think alot of people were maybe hoping to have more of the Alien monster in this film. It's not so much about the Alien monster but about where do we come from? It also touched on our origins, being from God and the Cyborg having a soul and can it ever feel or want to live. If you're looking for this film to answer these questions you will be disappointed, i thought part of what was good about this film was that it asked the questions. If you're just looking for another Alien movie you'll be disappointed, if you're looking for something more you might be pleasantly surprised.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|One of the best books Ive ever read. I highly recommend this book.  I read all the time and enjoy many kinds of books but this one has something special about it that mesmorizes the reader. Just wonderful to the end.
B004IY6API|5.0|Stained Class is a high plateau for the group in this place in time. In continuation of the maturity of the band's sound and style that was hinted at on the previous Sin After Sin set with Roger Glover's assistance, Priest co-produce this set with jazz/fusion producer/engineer Dennis MacKay and come up with an offering that surpasses Sin and for me, remains their best record thru and thru. Exciter opens the record with an earnestly aggressive tone taken from drummer Les Binks' double bass drum assault with a hyper tempo established from the main guitar melodies provided by K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, topped off by the strong and forceful vocals of Rob Halford that makes for a breathtaking opener for this disc. White Heat, Red Hot follows in and keeps the musical quality high with its main guitar riff that winds and twists along with a heavy metal boogie and continues to show off Halford's higher tenor register. The cover of Spooky Tooth's Better By You, Better Than Me is pretty excellent and in my opinion, is much better executed by Priest than Spooky's original take.<br /><br />The title track has a chugging riff throughout and Binks drives the number with his powerful kit playing. There are several sections of the number that layer and add more depth to the track in addition to the guitar breaks taken by Downing and Tipton and makes for a masterful track. Invader, Saints in Hell and Savage provide a powerful triad of songs that keep the consistency level ever higher within this set and proves that Priest have hit a certain stride in cultivating their classic definable sound. Beyond the Realms of Death is a classic number written by Binks and Halford and is a number that has stood the test of time as its staying power has been evident by remaining in Priest's setlists for many years. Heroes End ends the record on a powerful note and consolidates and justifies the vibe of strength to the entire record. Success was just around the corner for Judas Priest and theywould hit even higher heights of commercial glory with Unleashed in the East, British Steel and Screaming For Vengeance, but if it wasn't for the catalystic attitude displayed by Stained Class, Priest would never have reached those all important steps to their claim of one of the top movers in the New Wave of British Metal. 5 Classic stars
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Finally, a great Rush album. No, is not a return to the past, is a great record form the modern day Rush. I hope the next one incorporates more synths and, maybe, more cowbell!
B006VC3LES|5.0|First off, if you live in the UK dont bother about the (admittedly cheap) UK edition - get this one instead which is region-free. You get a very nice slipcase and loads of extras which are all missing from the UK one.<br /><br />Fantastic film and one of my top 10 films of all time. If you havent seen it just buy it. Polanski and Nicholson at their best.
B007ZLKKZM|5.0|This was our history!  This was about seeking answers knowing that love was only the fuel to drive our quest for meaning, peace and answers to life!<br />The Beatles encompassed the movement of peace and love whether they wanted that responsibility or not.<br />But, our lives and generations to come will be able to celebrate the genius and the music and the fab four we hold dear in our hearts as the Beatles.<br />But, in truth, it was John, Paul, George and Ringo!<br />The depth to these four guys made our lives deeper.<br />Thank you George for being the cool guy you were.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|The first one with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law seemed alttle better than this one.  Not quite sure why.  This one had more action sequences but it seems they were there just for the sake of action sequences rather than necessary for the story. Dialogue seemed abit weighty.  I am such a Sherlock fan and it is good to see different actors interruptation of the character.  Robert Downey Jr. is one of the good ones & I like Jude Law as Watson very much.  Liked the 1st one best but like this one too!
B005HSL626|1.0|when I was playing it turned black. I didn't even do anything for it do that. also the ads make it turn black.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game... is just... so addicting. and really fun like super fun and there's just one thing I don't get, after a while they start to run faster. wouldn't they run slower? but hey its a game. so whatever
B007J4T2G8|3.0|With all of the hype surrounding this book, I expected a far better read. I will not be purchasing or reading the second or third book in the trilogy.  I found Fifty Shades of Grey to be redundant throughout; therefore, reading the other two books would prove to be more of the same.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm into book 4, and am REALLY enjoying this series! The plot is great, character development is excellent, use of language is awesome. Really, REALLY enjoying it!
B0056M7FCS|5.0|Rhapsody is, as always, an excellent power metal band with heavy fantasy influence, and this album does not disappoint. Finishing the story that began in Symphony of Enchanted Lands II, good triumphs and the world is saved. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, but the melodies are powerful and the narration doesn't detract from the music. If you are a fan of Rhapsody's previous works or wanting to get into the genre, I would definitely recommend the Dark Secret Saga be on the 'required listening' list.
1451627289|5.0|The title \\"11/22/63\\" did not interest me at first because I thought the event has been studied to death.  But the time travel element left me intrigued. I read \\"Time and Again\\" by Jack Finney recently and it was so wonderful book I was left hungry for more. In fact, SK referenced to Jack Finney and \\"Time and Again\\" in his acknowledgement.<br /><br />This book did not disappoint.  Even though it's long but I wasn't bored.  I read with pleasures of the trips Jake made, the details of the period, the thoughts and actions of the people in the past. They are just fascinating, even if I lived through those years. In fact, the best part of the book was all things unrelated to JFK assassination.  I'd be happy even if SK eliminated the  JFK plot altogether.<br /><br />By the time you get to the end, you can't help but closing the book with the tears in your eyes.
B0086700CM|3.0|Awesome game but lags too much on the kindle fire. The lag will make you lose the game before you really get anywhere.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app.  easy to use and as accurate as weather reports ever are. my six year old grandchild can even use it.
B00705GEO4|5.0|This is the first Sabaton album I've heard, so I can't compare it to their previous body of work.  I happened to read an interview with the band in a magazine and was intrigued.  Carolus Rex is epic and powerful, combining great musical hooks with rousing vocals.  Keyboards and strings mesh well with distorted guitars to perfectly complement the lyrics of battle and ancient kings.  Who would've thought that a concept album about the Swedish Empire could be so darn catchy?  There isn't a bad track here; my own favorites including \\"A Lifetime of War\\", \\"The Carolean's Prayer\\", \\"Long Live the King\\", and \\"Poltva\\".  Carolus Rex is one of the most impressive releases of 2012 to date and I'll be sure to check out the band's back catalog in the near future.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I played almost all the Alaware games and they were really fun.  So I went looking for more hidden object games. I'll admit that the graphics on this game are really nice. But if you get stuck you're on your own. The hints are a complete joke. They refer to screen numbers which you can't see while you're looking at the hints. So they are almost completely useless. It also appears that you have to do things in a certain order or there's no way to win. Very disappointing.
0439023521|2.0|I read everything and anything I can get my hands on. So naturally, with Harry Potter sadly over and Twilight in the midst of fizzing out and dying even before the final and most \\"epic\\" movie yet comes out, The Hunger Games is a welcome invitation to move on and find a geat new trilogy and series. I will read eveything that beomes so popular only because I don't want to miss anything great and try not to listen to people who hate the books (ex: Twilight).<br /><br />The Hunger Games had such a great plot. The author was halfway there with that. She could have done SO MUCH MORE and in my opinion failed miserably at writing a compelling series. I think the only moment I liked the main character Katniss, was when she volunteered for the games so her sister wouldn't have to. That was it. After that, she immediately got on my nerves and I never felt like I cared what happened to any of them. The feel of the whole book, was that is was written in a way that the author hoped to get a movie deal out of it. She could have elaborated so much more about things, making the characters more real, and still would have gotten her movie deal so I barely even consider this to be a real book. It reads more like a blabbering screenplay.<br /><br />It's disappointing because the plot is a great idea. Was she the first to do something like this? No. But that doesn't matter when a great author writes a book. Harry wasn't the first wizard ever created on a page but he came to life and now no one will forget him. Even in Twilight, the vampires are real to the reader, whether or not you think the writing is good. These books Suzanne Collins wrote are so different. Somehow she writes fast paced and you can read it quickly, but there was never a point where I was concerned for anyone and despite the highly controversial/barbaric story line of what happens, it still didn't make me FEEL anything. Taking into account what these books were about, that's really saying something.<br /><br />And Katniss, why are you constantly staring at the screen or mirror and all of you including yourself are \\"mesmerized\\" by you? And why when you were in the games, were you always acting for the camera, smiling in a sly way, calling for Peeta because it will seem like the right thing to do, and always saying so confidently, surely, every camera is on ME right now. Again and again. Are you a narcissist Katniss? I think so.<br /><br />To me, the is a MAJOR issue and flaw with a book/series. The whole point is to lose yourself in a story and escape to another world. I could never forget I was sitting on my couch reading this.<br /><br />As for the rule breaking, Suzanne Collins is not the first to have holes in her story. She did change the rules of the games 3 times I think which is a bit ridiculous but I get why she did it. If they never changed it to district partners winning together, and then back again, Katniss and Peeta would never have decided to \\"check out\\" together at the end of the games. But she could have acheived this ending without changing the rules..if only the characters had some substance and personalities. Every book has holes, Lord of The Rings, Frodo could have just flown to Mordor with Gandolf on an eagle and the whole journey would never have happened. In Harry Potter, Gobet of Fire anyone? Harry didn't need to win the Tri-Wizard tournament to get to the graveyard. It's hard to find a perfect book with no holes at all. But other authors manage to make it not matter, the book is so good, you let it slide. This book however was the opposite. I'm going to flat out say I changed the rules, wait i'm changing them again, now one more time because third times the charm. Suzanne Collins only put enough effort into this to get it into the movies. And probably this series will be one of those where the movie is actually better then the books.<br /><br />That's not supposed to happen Suzanne Collins.

B004WOJ6XC|5.0|I bought this album along with several others about a month ago. Since then I have played this album once a day. That is how much I liked it. This album is actually my favorite Rhapsody album, and in many ways shows the evolution of their music. The early albums had both symphonic metal songs like \\"Flames of Revenge\\", and classical sounding music like \\"Forest of Unicorns\\". This album is very different using classical styles throughout the music rather than dividing the styles to seperate songs. In effect the two influences, metal and classical, are perfectly mixed. Stylistically the album resembles its two closest predecessors: Cold Embrace of Fear, and Frozen Tears of Angels. Unlike those two albums however, the music here is more upbeat. Also unlike the last two which to me sounded like Stratovarius this album sounds more like DragonForce.<br /><br />The best songs on the album are probably \\"From Chaos to Eternity\\", \\"Aeons of Raging Darkness\\", \\"I Belong to the Stars\\", and \\"Tornado\\". Added to these great songs are the epic multipart \\"Heroes of the Waterfall Kingdom\\" featuring narration by Christopher Lee, the Italian lyrics of \\"Anima Perduta\\",and \\"Tempesta Di Fuoco\\". The worst song on the album is probably the bonus cover of \\"Flash of the Blade\\". The song although an excellent cover, sounds a little strange due to the melodic style applied to a heavier song. I am unsure as to wether any hardcore Iron Maiden fans would like it, although any Rhapsody fan will.<br /><br />In listening to this album it is important to remember that Rhapsody is \\"cinematic metal\\" and their music particularly here is something straight off of a fantasy movie, video game, or book. I feel that when people forget this they are disappointed, or they have very picky notions of what fantasy should sound like. It is important to remember that fantasy is a wide genre and that fantasy music reflects this.<br /><br />Rhapsody of Fire has since this album split into two bands: Rhapsody of Fire, andLucas Turilli's Rhapsody. Many have speculated as to why, and I believe that it was a conflict over the material to continue the saga told in the albums. Lucas Turilli has obviously written a new album of material and perhaps, this new material was not to the others' liking. Or perhaps they wanted to wait before releasing a new album. We will never know. For now however, I will continue to listen to this great album while awaiting the upcoming album from Lucas Turilli's Rhapsody to be released in a few weeks.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Found the triligy \\"different\\" intriging, and easy reading.  The triligy was not like anything I had read before.  I do not think think these books are for everyone, but I enjoyed them.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Buying this without hearing it first made me nervous at first. The price was really great so I decided to give it a chance. I'm so glad I did. I have a home studio and needed a small mixer so I could take it on remotes and anything that just required a small system. This little thing is great! It is \\"whisper\\" quiet. The EQ's are what makes this a step above the rest. They react to the smallest touch! It's like I'm working on a larger, more expensive mixing board. It's great for patching effects through, handy for making live stereo video mixes, just a really nice tool to have. I find more and more things to use it on every day! If something ever happens to it I'll get another one just like it.

0393088774|5.0|This book is focused on what needs to be done, and he explains it in a way that even a non-economist like me can readily understand. In fact, what he recommends seems so obvious after reading the book that it's a wonder that everyone seems to be doing the opposite, which is clearly making things worse.

B0018J48QO|4.0|A messy, fun followup to Season 1! Dexter goes from defense to offense to defense as the writers weave often funny, sometimes warm storylines for this wonderful premium cable offering.<br /><br />The addition of Caradine's character is terrific and while I'm not as fond of the introduction of Lila but recognize the character's importance to moving the show along. I'm even falling for the often-annoying Deb Morgan played by Jennifer Carpenter...girlfriend keeps on pluggin' away on her own path of discovery. Even though the last episode was a slightly over-written, I'm still hemorrhaging over Dexter - 4.5 stars!

B0001AVZA8|3.0|\\"She made me watch it.\\" That's my story and I'm sticking to it. I had already practiced my eye-rolling by the time the opening credits began. Nicholson once again throwing his hat into the \\"I'm old but can learn new tricks\\" role, Keaton whom I've never really been fond of - I predicted a hurlfest!<br /><br />Thankfully, I was gigglingly surprised...not bowled over...just surprised. They story worked, except for some cringe-producing, predictable \\"schmoopie\\" dialog. Still, this wasn't too sweet for my palate! And, unlike the why-was-this-made Because I Said So (ugh!), I found Keaton not only un-annoying, but also (dare I say) HOT! She was costumed appropriately for her age and was someone I WOULD want to walk on the beach with.<br /><br />Can't quite push it up to 4 stars, but if you guys out there need to \\"check the Chick Flick Box,\\" some night, you might actually live through this one.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I watched this movie with high hopes thinking it's been around 30 years since the Alien movies so this movie would have a better plot. Forget about it. It's the same old, stupid sci fi horror flick. In face it's almost identical to Alien with a human robot. The very first scene when the captain is introduced, he's puffing smoke (Philip Morris product placement=$20mil), then comes the rugged, Mohawk hair cut-ed idiots under the title \\"scientists\\" (remember Bill Paxton in Alien?), then comes the bad weather and some get stranded in the structure, then comes the snake looking creatures with a bunch of teeth for a mouth (how does organic life survives in isolation for centuries? ---exactly. No imagination), then comes the idiotic ulterior motives (we traveled a gazillion miles to betray you--what?), then comes...it's just stupid.<br />The ending is even more idiotic. Let's carry a kamikaze attack by ramming this spaceship into the alien craft to prevent it from traveling to earth (ah, wouldn't earth have a better defense system to stop it? After all it is the 22nd century AND sound waves travel at the speed of light--send a warning to earth).<br />My recommendation is to pass on this one. Unless you're into idiotic, no imagination sci fi flicks.
B001C08RHA|3.0|I may not be \\"the guy\\" to review this flick because frankly, I'm not a Marvel comic junky. When I reach into my holster for comic-to-cinema, I only come up with Spidey Part Deaux and Batman Begins...so there you have it.<br /><br />Do I love RDJ? Yesssssssss! Jeff Bridges, too for that matter. Still, I didn't get the smarmy fun out of this movie I was hoping for based on the pre-release hype. Certainly watchable even for the non-die-hards, I just can't find myself gushing over it as I hoped I would.
030758836X|5.0|This book was a mind blower. The story is about a man, Nick, dealing with his wife Amy's disappearance. I loved how it was told. This book was meant to be told first-person because it would not have been as great any other way. The plot twists and the clues kept you guessing. Wondering what was to happen next. The first part pulled me in and had me completely engrossed in the story and it characters. The second had me guessing if I even read the characters right. Maybe these were different people, which they were in a sense. The ending shocked me so much that I could stop raving about how it ended. I reread the last chapter three times to make sure I comprehended it right. It is definitely one I am going to recommend over and over.
B000W91RUG|1.0|The only \\"bang\\" in this series for me was the sound of my remote hitting the television screen in disgust. My bad, I bought into all the rave reviews for this abysmal, Erkel-ized comedy.<br /><br />Throw glasses onto Johnny Galecki and it STILL doesn't make him funny. (His casting as the weirdo, brooding idiot on Roseanne I always found strange, too.) Are people finding this \\"cute\\"? \\"Smart\\"? All I can say if I am over 50% similar to you, do yourself a favor and find some quality TV sitcom reruns to scratch your comedy itch. This will having you banging your head against the wall.

0767802519|5.0|Twenty-something years after it's release, The Professional still holds it's own against just about anything I've seen out in the past few years. If you're Roger Ebert and can't handle why a 12 year old character is in a movie like this, don't rent it. (Uh, hello...that's part of why it's a compelling story, Rog!)<br /><br />On my fav list as a coming of age movie (of sorts), The Professional delivers compelling, tender moments amidst chilling, cold-blooded killing - try writing a movie like THAT. Oldman is simply out-of-the-box freaky as I've seen very few actors. Wild. Portman defines adorable - a role she reprises later in Beautiful Girls - slowly breaking down Reno's factory worker type hitman character. Cover your eyes during the bloody parts if you have to. It's a small price to pay for a wonderful flick.
B007K3JCAE|2.0|I never write reviews, but I had to speak up. I read all the issues with ultraviolet and made the decision to buy the Blu ray copy only. I put it in my cart and determined that buying the copy WITHOUT the extra dvd and Ultraviolet (the cheaper one ) was a 10 to 13 day ship! the copy that they want you to buy ships immediatly! What A rip-off.<br />I will be deleting this purchase. Walmart here I come.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|Coming off some serious withdrawals from both Six Feet Under and The Sopranos (the only reason I subscribed to HBO), I took a \\"stab\\" at Dexter. It took a couple of episodes for me to warm up to the character, but I did.<br /><br />I soon found myself rooting for a serial-killer who works for the cops which, to me anyway, means the writing is pretty good. The setting of post-Miami-Vice Miami is a visually interesting backdrop - although a little too much at times. Dexter has my interest and I'm devouring DVD after DVD as fast as they can be delivered. So far, it's scratchin' my itch for a solid cable series.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I didn't expect to like this as much as I did. Reminds me of Angry birds were you are trying to solve little puzzles. You want to destroy all the red blocks/circles while not destroying any green ones. Some of the puzzles took quite a few attempts to figure out. Like Angry Birds, there is often more than one way to get the job done as you just try to do it as quickly as possible. A lot of fun and well worth a dollar!
0385737947|4.0|-  I don't like the jargon in this book.  Words like Shuck, Shank, Klunk, etc.  It's annoying.  The characters use them like made up swear words.<br /><br />-  The whole book was pretty suspenseful.  I was hooked from the first chapter.<br /><br />-  It felt like Lord of the Flies and Ender's Game.<br /><br />-  There were lots of unanswered questions at the end!  I'm excited and NEED to read the next book.<br /><br />-  I love the Maze concept and how they solved it!!  It was awesome!<br /><br />-  I got a little frustrated from all the questions and no answers<br /><br />-  I couldn't really relate to any of the characters, probably because there was only 1 girl, and she didn't really do anything til later, but I still felt for the characters.  I love Thomas.  He is WAY braver than I am, and he is motivated to help others.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|It is a simple Sudoku game that seems well built and easy to use. You are literally playing within a few seconds of launching the app. It has openfeignt but you can just ignore it and play your game (thank goodness). For two bucks, this gives you a decent bang for the buck if you like Sudoku.
B0045HCJRG|4.0|-  Calvin Webber is on prepared guy.<br /><br />-  I would go NUTS underground!!  I think I would be a lot like Adam's mom.<br /><br />-  This was a pretty funny movie.  I laughed a lot.<br /><br />-  I am not a Brendan Fraser fan.  In fact, I usually shun movies he is in, but he was good in this one.<br /><br />-  Growing up in Genola in my parents house, I kinda feel like Adam sometimes.  For instance, Abbott and Costello are my favorite comedians!<br /><br />-  I enjoyed Dave Foley's character.  He plays a fun gay man.  I want to be his friend.<br /><br />-  This was a fun and cute movie.  I enjoyed it, and I thought I wouldn't.
B00004XQ8H|5.0|The Decca Legends series is among the very best among classical CDs.  Lisa Della Casa's performances here are to be treasured.  Most of the LEGENDS CDs are out of print in the USA, but thankfully, Amazon has connections to many European distributors.  Dodax-Online in Germany fulfilled my order on a timely basis. Packaging was secure and CD arrived in perfect condition. I'm pleased to have this marvelous performance in my collection.

B00005JPSM|4.0|-  I am not a chick flick person!  However, I now have 3 chick flicks that I really like.<br /><br />-  I love movies that involve food.<br /><br />-  I LOVED Nick.  He was SO charming, but I hated the pants he wore to work...and the crocs.<br /><br />-  Their 2nd kiss was hot!<br /><br />-  I admit it...I got teary during a couple parts.  Ever since I had my little gnome, children losing parents or parents losing children really get to me.<br /><br />-  The acting and actors were great!!  They were perfect for their roles.<br /><br />-  Zoe stole my heart, and I just ached for her.<br /><br />-  Kate is pretty.<br /><br />-  I really enjoyed this!  If you're a chick, I highly recommend this one!<br /><br />-  I want to watch it again.
0062060562|1.0|After so many 5 star reviews, I thought this must be a engrossing thriller. It wasn't. The first 50 or so pages were fine. After that, it continued on a downward spiral. Well, no it didn't. It fell flat and stayed flat. I didn't complete the book, instead started skimming and then, gave up and reached for the brilliant prose of Edward St Aubyn and thought thank god there are some writers who can really write. Whover S.J. Watson is, one thing is for sure, he is not a writer. I would not even lend this book to anyone because it was that bad.
B002ZG975Q|1.0|-  TERRIBLE!!<br /><br />-  The dad is Adam from Parenthood!<br /><br />-  Kyle was supposed to turn into an animal humanoid thing, not a guy with scars and tattoos.<br /><br />-  Why did they call him Hunter instead of Adrian?  I like Adrian much better!<br /><br />-  They changed a ton of stuff from the book.  I didn't like it.<br /><br />-  The movie was LAME!  I kept rolling my eyes and wishing it was over.<br /><br />-  Lindy was too pretty.  I wanted her to be more plain.<br /><br />-  The dialogue was dumb, and there wasn't much substance.  How did they fall in love?<br /><br />-  The acting wasn't great.<br /><br />-  The alternate ending was better, but not by much.

B00846REIS|5.0|I know the reviews are saying that Bared to You is similar to 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy; but I only slightly agree. Yes, there is an underlying theme of a broken billionaire, who owns a variety of companies. This timid, clumsy just out of college women who challenges him for a change starts working at his company. He pursues her and they start a sexual relationship - slightly dom/sub- that leads to more; while both parties can not bare to loose the other (forgive the pun). However, that truly is where the comparission ends.<br /><br />Bared To You has it's own story line, challenges, and darkness to it that is refreshing. When I began reading it, I intended to read only a few chapters (I started reading it at 10:30 pm). At 4 a.m. I finished the book. I couldn't put the book down, and most importantly did not want to! Eva and Gideon are so fragile in their own ways but have a similar past that haunts them - and almost crushes them. Their hunger to not only be loved but to be themselves with eachother is what really spoke to me. I am truly looking forward to reading her next one - Hopefully October!!
B007WULJ5G|2.0|I don't know where to begin. I knew from reading reviews that I needed to \\"witness\\" the uncut 104 minute version of this 'film'. Honestly, I wished I had gotten the 45 minute version. I have seen many graphic horror films (even snuff films) and this IS the grossest piece of crap that exists in this world today (at least from what I have seen). This DVD/movie needs to burned and boycotted. I am VERY open minded and can tolerate a lot of sick stuff, but this went waaay over the edge! I don't know if I will ever get this movie out of my head. This really messed me up! That is how gross it is. Repulsive is too mild of a word for this trash. I have never felt so dirty, filthy, and bummed out from a movie before. Like I said, I have watch gross movies before...but nothing like this!! At first, I wasn't going to write a review. But after reading people praising this movie, I had to wonder what sick world we live in. This is NOT entertainment, people!!!<br />It promotes the lowest of lows in filmmaking. The sickest part of all this: I couldn't stop watching it!<br />Just for what it is, it will be (if not already) a cult classic. As perverted a person I am, I had trouble getting through this one. It's not the pornography that got me, it's all the taboos that were displayed. Stuff in this movie is illegal here in the US. I wonder what makes us enjoy junk like this? I am sure I am going to hear from fans of this movie, so bring it. I had to give my thought on this movie. And to think, I was looking forward to seeing it. I will never be the same after witnessing this.
B001MUK7GY|5.0|this is awesome! Well, If you like batman anyway........Cant wait till my son gets older so we can share these 3 good movies together. the 4th one is crap but ill hang on to it so the box keeps its shape!

B008AZWMMG|5.0|Blood is a metal force to be reckoned with. It's heavy-hitting & macabre, and sprinkled with a dash of dark sexuality. This song kicks you in the balls and leaves you wanting more. It has a bass-line that you can feel all the way in your nether regions. The verses have an underlying porno groove to them, which serve as a means of foreplay before they explode into a chorus that will completely rock your world. This song is all about contrast - about the struggle between good and bad. Sonically, this song reinforces these themes - specifically in the changes in dynamics between verse and chorus.<br /><br />This song cements their place in metal history and proves that ITM are not just a one-trick-pony. They are here to stay. They are proving themselves to be everything a band should be: one that pushes the envelope & embraces change. I truly believe they have finally come into their own as musicians, singers, songwriters, and a band as a whole. Everything sounds exactly as it should sound and is exactly as it should be.  Their true fans will embrace this change. But all of the others will slowly fade away beneath a cloud of smoke.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I wanted to see what all the hype was about, when The Hunger Games came out in movie theaters recently.  Teens in particular were raving about the movie and saying the book was even better.  So I started reading, but found the storyline very depressing and disturbing -- kept reading, hoping it would get better later, but it just got worse.  Ridiculously brutal and graphic, tortured reading.  I don't even know why I finished the book.  Hope springs eternal, I guess.  I really can't imagine going on to the next book in the series.  I suppose analysis and underlying messages and themes could be conjured up, but I was too busy groaning about the obvious to be able to contemplate any deeper message.  I wouldn't recommend reading this unless your life is so filled with happiness that you are bored and need some nightmares.
B0074V3712|4.0|A great read! Using empirical understanding Dr. Wilson broke into areas not usually attempted and left me thinking about our nature. I strongly recommend.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game on my ipod but on the kindle fire the graphics cant keep up with the runner.
B000K4WLXA|4.0|Was a super great Christmas present to my daughter and a great addition to her movie collection.  Also loved all the bonus stuff.
B00881VLCE|3.0|pretty fun game.  I like that you can keep getting new puzzles.  It is a little herd to get the top piece and the game seems a little too big to fit nicely on kindle screen.
B0086700CM|5.0|get this app. it is so additive. when I got it, I wasn't sure about it.but when I started playing it I L -O-V-E-D it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The ads are too easy to hit while playing but overall it's a fun game. Lots of free pictures as well which is nice.
B00280LYHS|5.0|We can all agree that this book was breath taking. Also, it's great for the kids who don't normally like reading, I used to hate reading, but this series is what started my obsession with reading
0345803485|5.0|This book will have you feining for more. I read this book along side a few girlfriends at the pool for a nice summer read. We all enjoyed the dirty, hot, erotica that is 50 Shades of AMAZING!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This book is fifty ways of captivating. The complexities of the characters and their flaws and their relationships with each other had me turning page after page.<br /><br />Sleep became a thing of the past!<br /><br />Thank you Ms James for a beautiful love story

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|this needs to be updated! and I am havering troubles logging in. just plz update! I know we need a update
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|This movie is the funniest movie i have seen in a while. It really relates the characters to the high school days. It has great humor and some action. I don't understand why people dislike the movie. It's different than the 80's show, but it's a new spin that makes it very interesting. You must buy this movie! It is hilarious and has a great storyline.
B00009P1O2|5.0|My DVDs arrived quickly and in good shape. I watched this DVD the next day and truly enjoyed myself.  Well worth the price.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I am really enjoying the Outlander series.  After the first book, the characters seem like old friends and I want to keep reading about them.  They can get into some awesome prediciments.  It's fun to see how they get out of them.  After book one I was hooked.
B0040JHLF4|5.0|I've been wearing the Adrenaline for many years. I go thru about 4 pairs a year and always return to them. I slightly pronate and was turned on to them at a local running store and never looked back. They are lightweight (not minimalist of course) and an overall well made shoe with plenty of room in the toe box.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|My i7-2600K with the stock Intel fan was running at 70C+ all the time and reaching 99C when under load. I've ordered this product to replace it.<br /><br />Once I received it, I've spend about an hour reading the manual and wondering what I was missing since nothing seams to fit. That's when I decided to follow advice of another reviewer and watched the YouTube video posted by Cooler Master.<br /><br />What a difference that made. Heat sink was installed and motherboard back in place in under 10 minutes.<br /><br />CPU now runs at cool 33C with peaks under heavy load around 45C.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Perfect sleeve for the Kindle Fire.  Came as advertised without the \\"odor\\" many people have complained about. My future wife is very happy with my purchase!
B005LAIGP0|5.0|A film can never make everyone happy, let alone a horror one. Some like jump scares while others don't and think that they are ridiculous. I'm someone who really enjoys them! This movie had me on the edge of my seat for a large majority of the movie! Especially when -spoiler alert- Arthur goes into the marsh to retrieve Nathaniel's corpse and then when he's trying to summon the Woman in Black. I got a big jump out of what happens next. That one scene, along with the window scene, left a big impression on me. -Spoilers over-<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe's acting was excellent! I say that it was a step forward from his Harry Potter roles. While others say that he was emotionless, I disagree. I thought that his face conveyed enough emotion to sum up the suspense. I rarely thought of Harry Potter in this movie, but one of my friends did. He screamed \\"Use your wand, Potter!\\" during the summoning scene.<br /><br />Anyway, most \\"Horror\\" films rely on blood spraying every five seconds such as Scream. I think that this movie is a good sign for horror films, and I hope more scary movies like this come out.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I'm not usually a big fan of poetry but this book had such a compelling story wrapped up with the poetry that i found it quite enjoyable. Having lost both of my parents, I can totally relate. At one point towards the end of the book I actually cried. Must read!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|i dont know where to begin....it has been a long long time since i did not want a story to end.  because that is what this is, a story...it takes you in and captures you.  i am so sad i have finished it and it took a bit because it is a long story!  i look forward to the second book but i know it will be a long wait and i am an impatient reader.  get cracking anthony ryan!  and i think you can get more money for your future books!!
B0050CQY1W|3.0|I love Beyonce- her voice, her music, her moves. I have her CD's and a few concert DVD's as well. However, overall, this CD is one of those end of the road \\"putting out one last CD just to do so.\\" The only good songs are \\"Love on Top,\\" \\"Countdown,\\" and \\"Girls (Who Run the World).\\" Every other song seems whiny, and not in a beautiful \\"Dangerously in Love\\" sort of way. The slow songs have a different musicality about them that doesn't work with her style of voice. So overall, the CD gets the grade C+.
B0086700CM|2.0|3 times since I downloaded it for the first time.  At some point after a few plays the game resets.  I lose progress, coins, etc.  Don't really care about that, but then the system's app browser process gets corrupted and no apps will launch.  Reboot the tablet and it's a brick.  I have to wipe the user data.  I stopped re-downloading this app and no more brick.  Love the game, but I don't trust it.
B005CFWIF8|5.0|I now own a few different pairs of Crocs sandals. This style is very comfortable like my other pairs, except the fit for a size 5 is a bit tighter than my other pairs, but the material does stretch a little so they still feel very comfortable to walk in.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|This is a great cd.  Probably the best one they have done in a long long time.  I am glad to see that they still have it.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book.  I read all three.  It is a book I could not put down!!!!  I will re read.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just love this game its just dandy and very addicting I love to play it and so do all my friends
B005FISBTO|5.0|We got the premiere movie package for True Blood, but I was hunting through Showtime on Monday and found all of Season 6's episodes of Dexter. I normally have to wait until the DVD comes out. After reading some of the negativity here, I was prepared to not like this season as much. Not the case, it was gripping and I finished all of the episodes in three nights, and now I'm ready for Season 7. Now to convince my husband to keep the premium channels for fall.<br /><br />While Travis Marshall wasn't nearly as compelling as Trinity, the show has done well at creating the super-villain. The only one I was never really happy with was Miguel Prada (Jimmy Smits) in Season 3, and I feel that they drastically underused Jonny Lee Miller as Jordan Chase. I wish he had been a bigger part of Season 5. We got to see Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos from the start and Colin throughout the entire series.<br /><br />Religion is a HUGE part of the season and runs straight through. And it actually makes sense for Dexter to be struggling with religion and redemption at this point in his life as he tries to be a better person for his son. For those squeamish about religion being tied in, they're going to be offended right off the bat because there are some disturbing scenes. Also, this season definitely had more gore than I've remembered from before .<br /><br />***Spoiler***<br />As far as Debra's development, I think Jennifer Carpenter did amazing work this season, but then I've always liked her take on Deb. Yes, her revelation about Dexter created some squeamish moments simply because he is absolutely clueless to what is going on in her head, but moments between these two have always been my favorite part of the show. They've never been the best at communication, something that is discussed this season. But, they have gone through a lot together and have always been there for each other. And no, there is no biological tie, so if that's where the show is headed, well, I go down thatroad because I want to see what happens with these characters. I think the last moments of the finale may diminish some of those feelings ha! It has to be difficult for the actors considering their own history together, and to the reviewer that brought up their marriage and divorce, well that's just tacky.<br /><br />*Highlights: Dexter's joy ride to Nebraska and seeing an old, familiar face alongside him, and Mos Def as Brother Sam.
B001P06GX4|4.0|Hi,<br /><br />This is my review for [[ASIN:B001P06GX4 Blokus Classics Game]].<br /><br />It is a challenging game, and I like it very much. It is also educational as you have to be pretty skillful to win this game.<br /><br />As a con: The pieces don't look so durable, but this is only my point of view.
B0086700CM|1.0|It freezes up every time I try to open it. I've even tried installing iit a different time, but it won't work.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had not been interested in reading a romance novel in quite a while but when I received my new Kindle Fire for Mother's Day I decided to purchase this book to try it out.  I was not disappointed.  E. L. James is a gifted writer and I could not put down the book.  My only diappointment was that the story had no ending which meant that I had to purchase the other two in order to achieve a sense of closure!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie is about the acts of valor and courage that are performed every day by our military and our special forces. Many of the stars of the movie were active SEALS who portrayed the combat Navy Seals in the movie. The movie is based on real life scenarios but they are formed into a fictional story line. The action and suspense is outstanding and you understand what these soldiers endure in the face of the enemy every day.<br /><br />The SEAL team was so close knit that they knew what the other was going to do before they did it. They based their philosophy on a quote from Tecumseh, \\"While a single twig will break, a bundle of twigs are strong.\\" They were totally focused on the mission and protecting the members of their team.<br /><br />This is a story about the real world and it is graphic in nature. There are some very bloody scenes and some torture done by terrorist. These scenes will get to you so just be prepared. The movie is about drug smugglers using their money to finance terrorism, particularly against America.<br /><br />Since the film uses real Navy Seals as the actors the acting is OK but realistic. It is more real to life scenarios when compared to the highly polished Hollywood portrayals of soldiers. You should see this film to understand how these brave men defend our nation from those who would do us harm. The professional movie reviewers gave this movie a 25% good rating while the audiences gave it 78%. I gave it 5 stars for the storyline and for the heroes who acted in the movie and for those who died in combat. At the end of the movie they list the Navy Seal Special Forces members who have died since 9/11. It makes you wonder how many American lives they have saved.<br /><br />Two slogans at the end of the movie that strikes close to your heart:<br /><br />Die like a hero going home!<br /><br />In valor there is hope.
B000T45C32|1.0|I can't believe anyone thinks this movie is good, much less so many people think it is good. I found it painfully boring, trite and almost campy.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Not bad and keeps me busy when I travel and etc.. Worth the time playing if you're into puzzles like I am.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I love this game!!!  My storm id  ....  please add me once u get the game.  I try to clean my neighbors cities daily and give gifts.<br /><br />**Updated Review**<br /><br />I have stopped playing this game/app due to how much time you have to put into your restaurant. Also, to have a great restaurant, you really need to buy the in-app purchase items. I really disliked have to spend almost all day on this game/app just to make sure my restaurant stayed at the top rank. Changed star rating and removed my ID.

0070511136|5.0|As a passionate educator on selling, I can say that I have read most of the material on the topic while managing my own career as a successful sales practitioner.  Very few books, in my view, would deserve a \\"must read label.\\"  Rackham's Spin Selling would be among the group.  I don't know why, but some people I've talked to seemed to be intimidated by a complexity of the SPIN SELLING system that doesn't exist. It's NOT complex--it's common sense. That's it in a nutshell. Much of what passes for sales education seems to prod you to suspend your common sense so that you can learn survival tools to use in a fictional world of selling.  Read Rackham's book and put your career on track.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was written so creatively, so intelligently, I cannot recommend it enough.  It is a love story, a crime novel, or is it? The book constantly changes its angle making the reader think harder than the average novel, but because you want to more you are willing to do it.  For those who remember WYSIWYG expect the opposite.
0345803507|1.0|Such a waste of time and money. The author clearly doesn't know how to write a plot or use more than the same phrases over and over. Of course...this is a fanfiction based on Twilight(i did research and found this to be true), so I guess having any REAL literary value...doesn't matter. The overly used \\"taboo\\" scene isn't that interesting, in fact it's horribly cliche. My own sex life is much spicier than this wanna be Erotic novel. Don't waste your time, and precious money..there are other more interesting, as well as greatly written books out there.
B0086700CM|5.0|it's pointless,  but I can't ever put it down. it's just addicting. I play it whenever I can and my family enjoys it too.

0618918248|4.0|This is a great book! I especially enjoyed the scientific parts. Dawkins offers very convincing arguments as to why God is very likely to be a fictional character and a very cruel one according to popular versions of the fiction. It truly raises consciousness about the often subconscious reverence of religion by irreligious people. It also accounts for why religion is so prevalent now and even more in the past. I feel that Dawkins is at times being too reserved on criticism of religion. There are certain parts of religion, like indoctrination of children, that are downright despicable and insane. There are certain blunt hypocrisies in our legal system where religion becomes impregnable and extremely privileged. This affects the legal system and the rest of us who are not deluded must live under the system build to serve the mythologies of deluded people.<br /><br />Dawkins' philosophy is quite sound. However, the sophistication and presentation is not quite on the level of professional philosophers and that is why I gave it four stars although it deserves 4.3.<br /><br />One specific issue I would like to take up is abortion. I am a bit lost on the issue, however, Dawkins' makes it seem ridiculous to dislike abortion. I dislike it because I believe once the process has started, if left uninterrupted it would create human life. This is how I feel and I can offer no further reason for it. But all moral judgments are inevitably based on unjustified principles. Dawkins has taken the principle that lack of consciousness and inability to suffer makes a \\"subject\\" unworthy of moral consideration even where existence is concerned. He offers no justification for it which is quite acceptable as it is simple and general enough to serve as a base principle. I feel that where abortion is concerned if the potential for a happy and fulfilling life exists the process that has already began should not be interrupted. I can offer no justification for this principle either but how canwe possibly decide who is \\"correct\\"? As for birth control, the process has not started yet. I am irreligious btw. I should note that if I knew that my future child would have a life of pain and sadness I would abort early but otherwise I would really dislike abortion and would not do it myself.<br /><br />Getting back, the last chapter includes some very interesting info in physics. However those who studied physics at university will not be impressed by the now mundane facts. Non physics students will likely enjoy it very much.

Purple Hibiscus is a good book, but it's one of those first novels that doesn't really demonstrate the author's true abilities.<br /><br />This book is narrated by Kambili, a 15-year-old girl living in contemporary Nigeria. She comes from a wealthy family, and her father is widely admired for his support of the Catholic church and his fearless publication of a pro-democracy newspaper. Beneath the surface, though, he rigidly controls the lives of his family and brutally punishes them whenever they fall short of his expectations. Kambili and her brother don't think to resist until they visit their poor but loving relatives and begin to expand their horizons.<br /><br />Purple Hibiscus does a good job of what it tries to do: detailing the life of its protagonist and the beginnings of change. Adichie writes well and the characters have depth (although they're not as amazing as the characters in Half of a Yellow Sun). Even the abusive father is a fully-fleshed out character rather than a generic antagonist, and the book does a great job of exploring the family's complex feelings toward him; Kambili is proud of her father, she loves him and wants his approval, and we can understand why she feels that way despite everything.<br /><br />If you like immersion in characters' lives, this book has it in spades. We don't have to be told that life in Kambili's father's house is suffocating; the book walks us through every step of it. And there is so much detail about the daily lives of her aunt and cousins that I feel as if I've been their houseguest myself. To the extent that there's a lot of information about a culture I'm unfamiliar with, I enjoyed this. The downside is that at times, the massive amount of detail about chores and meals and so on seems to get in the way of the plot.... or rather, because Kambili's development depends on this slow and subtle change in her worldview, we have to read through an awful lot of mundane events to get the full picture. Either way, even while it was good, I have to admit to some impatience with the pacing.<br /><br />In sum, this book isn't much like Half of a Yellow Sun (and if you haven't read that book yet, go and read it now!), but it's a decent first novel that does a good job at what it tries to do. I plan to read more from this author, but I hope her future novels will be more like her second book rather than this one.iew, we have to read through an awful lot of mundane events to get the full picture.

0143119680|1.0|I really enjoy all types of fantasy: Epic Fantasy, high fantasy, vampire fantasy etc. I occasionally enjoy a good ya fantasy, or even romance. But I can tell you this author is clueless. I work for a university and the blatant use of all the big words used are just insipid. Also, the characters are lifeless. Have you ever read a story that makes your breath catch and your heart clench? There is none of that here! This author is clueless on what her readers are looking for. I've read better fan fiction! And I'm not going to waste anytime comparing this to Twilight. I read Twilight, and even with all its obvious issues, it was better than this book.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews written here since the release of Clockworks Angels, I'm hardly alone in my feelings about this disc. For a band that released its first album 38+ years ago, have released another 19 (or 20 if you count Feedback) studio albums since then, and whose members are 58/59 years old, to release something even close to the majesty of Clockwork Angels in 2012, well, like the review title says, is this even legal?<br /><br />There is a ferocious, immediate, driving quality to this work (title track, BU2B, and Headlong Flight are great examples), balanced by some of the most melodic and emotional pieces they've ever produced (Halo Effect and the astounding The Garden). Heck, there's even a legitimate pop single or two in here (The Wreckers & Wish Them Well)...not that radio will ever play them.<br /><br />As a live band, Rush has been described to me by casual fans as \\"playing each song like it's the last time they'll ever get to\\", and \\"rocking twice as hard as bands half their age\\". To me, Clockwork Angels captures that essence perfectly with an edge that's been missing from their last few studio efforts.<br /><br />Rush fans have undoubtedly already bought this disc. Rock fans, now it's your turn to step up and experience true masters at work!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is AWESOME! Breathtaking! When you start playing you can't stop playing! You can easily get addicted to it! You should really get this game!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been listening to Clockwork Angels almost non-stop for 3 days now, and I still can't get enough of it. It really is a complete piece and, in my opinion, their best album since Counterparts, and maybe even better than that. One of the things I like most about it is that they seem to borrow a little bit here and there from throughout their entire catalogue. The solo in Headlong Flight, for example, sounds like something straight off one of their 70's albums, while tracks like The Wreckers have the even tempered melody you'd expect from a Signals or Moving Pictures song.<br /><br />Every Rush album is a unique and experimental endeavor, and so it's hard to compare Clockwork Angels to any of their previous work, but on its own I'd say this album has a little bit of everything for a Rush fan to like. It has some of the heaviest songs on it that I've heard from the band in a long time, and the mastering is really well done. You can really feel the bass and drums booming at you on this album.<br /><br />I'll admit, I was a little disappointed by Vapor Trails and Snakes and Arrows, but if this is the new direction the band is going, I'm definitely on board for the ride and can't wait to hear what's next.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|51 year old 'fossil' RUSH fan here.  First saw them live during 'A Farewell To Kings' tour, and was blown away and 'hooked' by their masterful sound, and world class approach to rock music.  This October will be my 50th live RUSH concert since the 70's in 4 states (states of euphoria, ecstacy, intensity, and incredulity... just kidding!).  That said, I won't analyze the songs on 'Clockwork Angels', as that has already been done here ad nauseum, and besides, this can be subjective based on personal tastes and poetic interpretation.  RUSH has always been about quality and musical evolution and change, given their many memorable forays into different sonic styles and elements. 'Clockwork Angels' is no different.  Musicality and song writing is top notch, and CD sonics are above average (for all you audiophiles out there).  The songs are excellent, and if I had to pick a standout favorite, it would be 'The Wreckers'.  What a gorgeous, emotive, and introspective tune!  I can't get it out of my mind!  THANK YOU Geddy, Alex, and Neil for sharing your immense gift of music all these years, with the rest of the world!  You guys are timeless!  Now, PLEASE play Greece and Israel (I have cousins there who are HUGE, longtime fans, and would love to see you)!

0345803485|5.0|Having read erotica for years, I find it delightful that Fifty Shades of Grey is an erotic book written for WOMEN. It is the ultimate romance novel with sex blissfully and thoroughly described. Finally, there is an explicitly sexy book for women that is mainstream, appeals to romance novel lovers and, yet, is thoroughly modern. It is the first book that is not-so-subtly \\"pornographic\\" that can be read in public (sorry Anais Nin and Anne Rampling).

B005LAIGPA|2.0|This movie is a (deliberate?) mockery of young superhero coming-of-age stories. The typical formula revolves around virtuous young social misfits who use their newfound powers secretly to help others. These three directionless Gen-Xers are just out for a good time, with predictably disastrous consequences. The \\"found footage\\" camera work is infuriating - jerking constantly, like Blair Witch and Cloverfield - and the ending fizzles unconvincingly. The actors try hard, and the SFX are good, but meaningful subplots are neglected, the plot and dialogue are unconvincing, and I reject the apparent message that people only try to do the right thing as a last resort.

B0088TG252|2.0|Shame on Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington signing on to do this movie... It was a predictable bore fest that had no entertainment value to speak of. I tried watching it a 2nd time and it was even worse. I think the Studio knew this and that's why they put it out 2 weeks early (but only to buy.) Denzel and Ryan are 2 of my favorite actors in all of hollywood, but they both deserve blame for giving half-assed efforts on a terrible script.
1936608898|5.0|I am not a nutritionist, food blogger, medical professional, or anyone 'notable' in the food and nutrition industry. I am just an average mom of 2 who happened to stumble on a new lifestyle. I feel very fortunate to be able to have received a copy of this book for review. Here is my (abbreviated) story:<br /><br />In February of 2011, after being inspired by some incredibly amazing results achieved by a good friend of mine, I jumped in with both feet and started a Whole30. After 2 difficult pregnancies and some pretty steady post-pregnancy weight gain, I found myself about 100 pounds over the limit. Something had to give - I decided to start with food, and Whole30 seemed like a pretty easy and sound way to do it. The first time I hit the Whole9 Life blog, I rolled my eyes at the \\"Let Us Change Your Life\\" banner. I mean, how many times had I seen a similar message crammed into some infomercial promising miracles, right? But this wasn't something I had to buy. The information was right there on the blog, free for all to use and try on their own. So I tried it. I figured I would give it 30 days and see how I felt. I really had no intention of making permanent changes to my diet. But after 30 days, I was amazed at how I felt and how my body was already changing. Maybe that tagline wasn't so much BS after all...<br /><br />Within the first week, the ever present hunger that I had been experiencing since the beginning of my first pregnancy: GONE.<br />By the second week, energy levels were up.<br />By the third week, I felt AMAZING. Seriously, amazing. Even with the limited sleep that my youngest child was according me.<br />By the fourth week I was dying to jump on that scale to see if there were tangible results to go along with how great I was feeling: 10 pounds down. INCHES gone from my body! I was in tears. I had not seen the scale move any way but UP in years.<br />And do you know what? They were right! This.Is.Not.Hard!<br /><br />I began to devour anything and everything about Whole30 and paleo and clean eating that I could get my hands on. I am an active member in several communities and I HAVE completely changed my life - all due to  Whole9 and this simple little program.<br /><br />Over the next year: exercise, 4 more Whole30s, and a solid paleo lifestyle in between - and I lost 70 pounds and over 40 inches from my body! I have lost more weight than my 2 children COMBINED! Whole 30 and clean eating just plain works. It gets the garbage out and gets the good stuff in. It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle change.<br /><br />The information in this book is life changing, life saving, and a guide to a healthy and vibrant lifestyle. Dallas and Melissa manage to present the information in an incredibly straightforward, simple, and humorous manner. They cut right to the chase explaining why and how consuming foods make you either more or less healthy.<br /><br />It Starts With Food is downright brilliant. Even as a reader who is versed and experienced in Whole30, I am finding this book to be a valuable resource. Not only for myself, but as an easy way to explain to others why our food choices are so powerful.<br /><br />Kudos to Dallas and Melissa: you really hit this one out of the park.
0062068423|4.0|To be fair, Jo Nesbo is a master of the genre. The pace is relentless and the narrative unbelievably engaging. He also pulls no punches. There were plenty of times when I cringed. Having fallen in love with a character, it was very hard to have bad things happen to them. While the twisting of the knife is not egregious, its still enough to wind the nerves taut. There was a point around Chapter 10 (no spoilers) when I just wanted the pain to stop. Grit your teeth gentle reader, this one brings quite a bit of heartbreak.

B00756GRUE|5.0|DESCRIPTION:  The Seiko SSC017 Eco-Drive watch is a diver's style quartz/electronic chronograph (a watch with stopwatch functions) that is water resistant to 200 meters and whose battery is continually recharged by any strong light source.  Available in three color variations, the cal. V175-0AD0 version presents a dark black dial with large white, luminous hours and minutes hands and large white, luminous dot, dash and keystone-style hour markings, under a simple, uncoated tempered glass (\\"Hardlex\\") crystal.  The unmagnified date is shown as small white digits on a black background, between the 4 and 5 o'clock positions on the watch face and requires resetting for any month that is not 31 days in length.  The crystal is recessed very slightly below a surrounding beveled timing bezel, which helps to protect it against scratches.  Three smaller sub-dials in the lower half of the watch face display seconds, elapsed minutes (for the chronograph function) and 24-hour time (locked permanently to the main hour hand).  Since the 24-hour time display is NOT INDEPENDENTLY ADJUSTABLE, this watch does NOT support a second time zone (so-called GMT function).  The seconds and 24-hour indicators are stark white and the former also has a luminous dot, making them readable despite their small size.  The chronograph minutes indicator in the center sub-dial is sky blue, which blends in with the black watch face, and is more difficult to see.  The large second hand on the main dial is used for the chronograph function only, to display seconds/fifths of a second, and is finished in sky blue, also blending in with the watch face.  Surrounding the watch face is a 120 click-stop, ratcheting timing bezel, beveled so that the inside circumference is slightly higher than the outside.  The bezel rotates counterclockwise only (normal for a dive watch) and is finished in sky blue (from 12 to 3 o'clock position) and black (from 3 to 12 o'clock) with matte silver digits for 10, 20, 30, 40  and 50minutes, a luminous dot at 60 minutes and silver minute tick marks in between. Bezel operation is very smooth and well damped and it is easy to find a good grip on the serrated but rounded bezel edges, making setting quick and easy, even with (wet suit) gloves on.  On the right side of the watch is the crown, for time/date setting.  Above the crown is the chronograph \\"start\\" button and below is the \\"lap/reset\\" button.  Both crown and buttons are of the screw-down type, intended to prevent accidental operation while in the water (the chronograph and time setting functions should not be used when the watch is wet) and to ensure water resistance.  Crown and button edges are serrated for good grip, but are also elevated off the wrist enough by case thickness to prevent skin irritation.  Crown unlock/lock operation is smooth, but button locking collars require significant torque to lock or unlock, are loose when in between lock/unlock and are not very refined in operation.  The watch case itself is a very solid piece of stainless steel, with well rounded corners, making it comfortable to wear despite its significant mass.  The top of the case is matte finished to match bracelet side links while the sides and back are polished.  The solid stainless steel circular back case cover is domed to resist pressure and screws tightly into the case and (most likely) o-ring seal to provide robust water resistance.  The cover lists the watch caliber and serial numbers, plus the usual Seiko \\"breaking wave\\" dive watch logo.  The heavy stainless steel bracelet has a very secure double locking, push-button clasp and a flimsy, difficult to deploy wetsuit extension that does not inspire confidence. Center and side links are solid (rather than stamped/folded) stainless steel, but the end link covers and wetsuit extension are stamped/folded steel.  Links are held together by the overly complex Seiko pin-and-collar system, which makes resizing this bracelet a chore.  Center links are polishedwhile side links are matte finished.<br /><br />KEY FEATURES: 1. Very legible luminous hours and minutes hands and markers with excellent visibility day or night (lume lasts for hours), 2. Solar/available light recharging of built-in Lithium-Titanium battery, with a 6-month power reserve (means no battery changes needed - just leave it in the sun for a day to recharge), 3. 60-Minute stopwatch/chronograph function with 1/5 second resolution and lap (second parallel event timing) capability, 4.  Timing bezel with very smooth operation, for longer, lower resolution timing of events, 5. Water resistance to 660 feet (200 meters), ensured by screw-down crown and buttons and a robust, domed case back, 6. Double locking bracelet with a push-button clasp, wet suit extension and sub-link, spring-bar adjustable sizing, 7. Quartz accuracy (mine gains about 60 sec./year) that minimizes resetting of watch time.<br /><br />GENERAL IMPRESSIONS:  This is a handsome, robust and very practical watch that looks much more expensive than it is.  For about two C-notes, it is impressively built and, with a few minor exceptions, very easy to read and use.  Seiko obviously spent considerable engineering effort making sure this watch had the features and quality to back up its stated purpose. For example, the timing bezel on most dress \\"dive watches\\" in this price range is an afterthought and functions poorly.  They are often stiff and difficult to set or read.  But the bezel on the Seiko SSC017 is as smooth as any Rolex or Breitling, only better damped and easier to set.  Competing chronographs in this price range (and some priced 10x higher) have buttons and crowns styled to look as if they have screw-down positive locking, but do not.  This Seiko has the real thing.  The rounded case edges, sturdy domed back cover and very bright, long-lasting lume on the hands and time marks of the watch face round out a very practical and attractive timepiece.  Solar/available light recharging with a very long 6-month reserve is a significant bonus Seiko appears to have thrown in free - goodbye maintenance!  Some have quibbled that the 24-hour sub-dial would be better used for a GMT or chronograph hours function.  Yep.  GMT capability would have been very useful.  But it would have also added lots of internal complexity and cost to the watch.  So the 24-hour sub-dial function remains marginally useful as an AM/PM indicator for watch date setting, and also as a \\"% of day complete\\" indicator.<br /><br />ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT:<br />As good as the watch is, the bracelet (though adequate) is overly complex, clumsy and inconsistently engineered.  It is difficult to add/remove links due to the complex Seiko pin and (minute) collar system that uses sand-grain size collars to lock pins in place.  Try resizing this at home and you'll wish you'd gone to a (good) jeweler, after you've lost the collar(s) while trying to put them in place using tweezers, with aid of a microscope. The links are solid machined steel and seem bullet-proof.  So why did Seiko include a tiny stamped steel diver's extension that looks like a soda can pop-top?  Not that you'll ever use it, because it takes a screwdriver or pair of pliers to deploy (maybe a safety feature?). Even the designer of the extension must have had second thoughts, because when NOT deployed a sturdy steel hook makes sure this structural bomb is bypassed by substantial metal and does not compromise the strength of the bracelet.  And the stamped/folded end links covers do not fit flush in the watch ends, leaving the sharp watch case finger edges slightly exposed.  Nonetheless, the push-button, double locked stamped-steel clasp is precisely adjustable and secure while remaining attractive and functional in normal use.  A second minor area for improvement is the button locking collars, whose rotation and lock/unlock should be better damped and operate more easily.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:  Even with its minor shortcomings, this watch is a keeper and outstanding value, hence my five-star rating.  There simply is not much else this solidly built, attractive, readable and functional in the price range.  Except for the diver's extension, it does exactly what it promises to do.  Other style variations have yellow (model SSC021 with black rubber bracelet) or red (model SSC015) chronograph hands which increases visibility of these functions, though the sky-blue version is striking.  Model SSC021 with its adjustable (buckle) rubber bracelet and highly visible yellow chronograph hands is likely the most useful for diving with a wet suit, should this be contemplated.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After one week of use, the bottom chronograph \\"pusher\\" button's screw-down collar stripped its threads.  The dealer promptly exchanged the watch for a new one, and this second one has had no problems.  I treat the pusher collars much more gingerly now, though.  And after 3 months of swimming, boating and other activity, the watch  still works and looks great.  Yeah, there are scratches on the polished center links, but these are only visible very close up - so no real issue there.

B004K8WPUQ|5.0|My original disappointment with DSLR video (various Nikons, Including the D7000) was that the onboard microphone recorded sound that was dominated by the focusing motor.  I hated the way that this sound infiltrated all of my home movies.  With the purchase of this microphone, I have removed the dreaded motor sound.  On top of that, this microphone has made all of my video efforts better.  The microphone has somewhat limited audio level controlling, but it turns out that it is enough for all of the different situations I have been in since purchasing this microphone.  I have recorded soccer games, a birthday, a music recital, and various videos of my family near and far.  All of these videos have great audio now.  The setup was easy, and I have not any problems with the microphone.  It seemed a bit risky price wise when I ordered it sound unheard, but I could not be happier with the purchase.  If you are thinking about buying this microphone or an equivalent, I highly recommend this microphone.  Obviously, it is not as good as a separate microphone and recorder, but just like an onboard flash, this microphone saves you in a large number of situations, and it is convenient and easily integrated into my prosumer setup.

B004UID2LC|4.0|I have had this application on two different phones: the Droid 2 and the RAZR MAXX.<br /><br />I never had any issues with the app on my Droid 2, except for one.  At some point I was only able to download regular videos, not HQ, nor was I able to download as any audio format.  I do not know when this issue was rectified, but at some point it was, and I had no issue on my Droid 2 after that.<br /><br />When I bought my RAZR MAXX, I regulated my out of date Droid 2 to storage (but not before discovering the phone still could still access the web and download things via Wi-Fi *YAY*!!!!).  On my Razr MAXX I didn't have the app for a few months, only because I had completely forgotten it.  I downloaded the app again a little over a month ago, and had no problems with the app.  I was actually very impressed with the speed in which it searched and downloaded.<br /><br />However, a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that, while I was able to open the application and do a search, I was unable to view any videos as well as I was unable to download ANYTHING.<br /><br />When I tried to view online as HQ or regular, I received the error message: Can not play this file, please check current connection quality.  Now I have a 4G LTE phone, so I am thinking,\\"WHAT?!?!?!\\"<br /><br />When I tried to download anything, I received no error message... the app just kept saying,\\"searching\\" under the video I was trying to download.  So I would go to the 'Downloading' folder, and it would say: File size is not yet available.<br /><br />For a week I researched online problems, trying to troubleshoot.<br /><br />It was recommended to:<br />*Update YouTube, which I did... no go.<br /><br />*Make sure that the FreeDi was most up to date (and I did have an older version, but there was an update available)... nothing.<br /><br />*Uninstall old version and then redownload the newest version... nope.<br /><br />I even went so far as to factor reset my phone... negative Ghost Rider.<br /><br />After all the research and trouble shooting I did, I came to the unwanted conclusion that the problem was due to some shortcoming of my phone.  (Yes, I resentfully blamed my awesome Razr MAXX... if you knew the issues I have had with 'smart phones' for the past 8 years... you would understand.  Just to touch base on my past two phones: my Droid 1 was replaced 9 times... my Droid 2 replaced 11 times, all due to issues ranging from software issues screen malfuntions... etc, not one case was because I broke the phone, dropped the phone, or anything else).<br /><br />I uninstalled the application as I never keep an app on my phone I do not use.<br /><br />A week ago, I came across my good ol' (not so trusty) Droid 2.  On a whim, I decided to charge it up and take a looksie at it.  When it was fully charged (only took like an hour, because the battery is fried), I turned it on and noticed that I still had 'FREEdi YouTube Downloader' on the phone (Please note that the version of the app was a 2 previous older one than is out now).  I connected to Wi-Fi, went into the app, searched a video, and first attempted to view as and HQ video and it worked.  I then attempted to download as a video, and when that worked, attempted to download as an MP3... both of these worked.<br /><br />Excited that the app may be functional again and not the Razr MAXX at all, I redownloaded the app to my Razr MAXX and attempted all of the above: Nothing... Zilch... NADA...<br /><br />After all of the above had worked on my DROID 2 and not my Razr MAXX, I was staring stupidly at my Droid 2, and becoming increasingly resentful toward my Razr MAXX when I realized... WI-FI.<br /><br />I accessed the Wi-Fi on my Razr MAXX and lo and behold... EVERYTHING was now working in the application.  Just to be certain I toggled between 4G and Wi-Fi numerous times and tested out the application.  The app was working quickly and flawlessly via Wi-Fi.<br /><br />Problem solved, resentment for my Razr MAXX gone, and the Droid2 went back into storage to collect dust because, quite honestly, it is a boh boh phone.<br /><br />So, at the end of my long winded story....<br /><br />If you have tried all trouble shooting and the app is still not working... try Wi-Fi.  That may solve all of your issues with the application.<br /><br />I don't know why the developers changed the way the videos could be viewed and downloaded... but to speculate a little:<br />* Maybe it is just my 2 different phones (with different software and app versions... yeah right).<br /><br />* Maybe it is because Google now owns YouTube (possible).<br /><br />* Maybe it is because Wi-Fi is just faster.<br /><br />* Maybe the developers are keeping in mind that people are being throttled for capping data (because streaming and downloading stuff does use crazy amounts of data) and the use of Wi-Fi lessens the data usage.<br /><br />Food for thought.<br /><br />I am troubled that the ability to view and download changed suddenly without me updating the app... How is that even POSSIBLE!!!????<br /><br />Wi-Fi is faster... but you know what?  I don't always have access to Wi-Fi, AND I have an awesome 4G LTE phone (why have the 4G LTE if I cannot even use it????) Hence the four star instead of the five star rating.

0440213525|2.0|Grisham's copy editor must have been asleep at the wheel on this book. I'm about 30 pages into the story, not too impressed at this point, although it is a page turner, until I stumbled on one narrative passage on page 12: \\"heavy man with the red face was running through the weeds, holding on to the car and growling.\\" Can anyone say dangling participle? How does one run through the weeds while holding on to a car? That's some trick. He could have shuffled, side stepped, or what have you, but run? I mean, this is Grisham for God's sake. I would assume that he'd have better copy than this, not to mention better sense than to write such grammatically incorrect sentence.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I'll resist pontificating like the rest of the 'experts', offering Rush my suggestions on 'how it should be done'. I just want to say that this is a great collection of songs, & it's given me great joy to listen to it (over and over).  Not many modern releases give me as much satisfaction & replay value as this release has the past week.  Hats off to the band for continuing to follow their muse while still staying relevant.  One of their best, imo.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|When a book of this caliber is #1 on lists it just shows what reading has come down to. I truly appreciate sensuality in literature, i.e. Lady Chatterley's lover, but this is really porn and no true plot. Guess it reflects how lonely the lives of so many women have become that this is some kind of fulfillment. I recommend real books with real literary references. However, I am happy that the author has achieved her success in this tough literary world.
B00813HP7E|5.0|Well written, fabulously inventive show with very interesting characters. We're positively hooked, and we can't wait to see what happens next year! Full of intruige and plot-twists, with lushly-filmed fairytale backstories intertwined with the on-going events in Storybrooke. Best part is Rumplestilskyn; he's fascinating in both worlds.
B0074VTHKM|2.0|This book is written for children. No tension, no excitement whatsoever. I don't recommend it for the readers over 15. All the books in this series are just dull.  I'm very disappointed because I was hoping to have a strong suspense reading.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|Wow, this book is amazing!  I've told a few other people about it now that I finished reading it.  It actually helped reinforce a number of things for me.  As a practicing Friend (Quaker) it also reinforced some of my beliefs.  I liked the concept of the book and of her NDE.  As a nurse I've met a few others who have experienced NDE but none as detailed as this one.  The author writes well and describes her experience so that others feel as though they are experiencing it too. Overall,  I found the book to be comforting.

B005JE7WKI|4.0|I finally gave Amazon Instant Video a try on my PS3 and my inaugural viewing was Tucker & Dale vs. Evil. A friend recommended the movie as \\"a kind of [[ASIN:B005J9ZE5I Evil Dead 2]] meets [[ASIN:B0025VLEM0 Shaun of the Dead]]\\", which were both iconic, comical \\"serious but spoofs at the same time\\" satires on the horror genre.<br /><br />Where the heck did Tucker & Dale vs. Evil come from? It was totally off my radar for a 2011 DVD release, so I'm glad that it was brought to my attention. Because this was a good movie! I assume that it will start running on cable soon, and that should elevate it to a classic late-nighter from the sleeper that it is today.<br /><br />Tucker and Dale are a couple of country bumpkins on their way to a remote cabin in the Appalachian Mountains that Dale recently purchased as a vacation home. On their way they run into a bunch of college kids who immediately stereotype the back-country duo as a couple of mean-looking, [[ASIN:B000Q8X5A8 Deliverance]] psychos.<br /><br />The result?...A surprisingly well done movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. It ranged from over the top silly to gory to genuine scares, laugh out loud moments, and even some heartfelt love for poor Tucker and Dale.<br /><br />Check out this funny movie that throws irony in the face of the clich&eacute; Horror genre plotline. 3 ½ stars.

0439023513|3.0|There could have been more, the plot has already been set for us. That's fine I can live with that. The story though needed more time to unfold that a Trilogy. Granted this could have been what the author wanted but it didn't feel that way. I mean so many things needed fixing in this book from deaths of characters, to how to deal with pent up grief, to district 13(which sort of reminded me of every single historic read on socialistic societies), ect.<br />I wasn't pleased at being rushed through a book or given a half written ending.

B002BGIDRI|5.0|The information in this book has helped me focus on what i need to know as a manager. Working with the different demands and needs of other personnel creates tension in your workplace.
0375842209|5.0|First of all, I read this book because my 9th grade son chose it for his English class free read and I like to read the books that are assigned to him.  I devoured it.  Though I read it a couple years ago, the details of the story are now out of focus, but the essence of it STILL remains with me.  I read a lot of Fiction, YA Fiction, Historical Fiction, nonFiction, Children's books, and Classics.  This book remains in my top 10.  This story was beautifully written in a loving, yet unorthodox manner.  Death narrates.  That, by itself, caught my attention.  It is also a bit of Historical Fiction of WWII, but from the side of a young German Girl who has to witness the atrocities of her country and try to remain safe from persecution, while NOT being Jewish.  Oh, did I also mention her family is hiding a Jewish man in their basement?  There are plenty of sad parts (given the theme), but the ending truly touched me and has stayed with me 2 years later.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

B006W0QR1S|1.0|The preview is a better movie than the movie. It looks like it is an action flick, with maybe some drama and romance mixed in. In reality, it is 1 hour and 30 minutes of awkward silences with 10 minutes of completely unexpected, random and senseless violence. There are huge stretches of the movie where no one says anything, and there is no music whatsoever. The few lines of dialogue in the movie are stilted, awkward, and completely without context. What little music there is, is completely inappropriate for the moment. There is no background ever given, and the characters say and do so little it is extremely hard to feel anything for them. By the end of the movie, all you are left with is a general feeling of \\"wtf?\\"
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Well, as you should have gathered by now, this a prequel to Alien/s. With that said, it was more a very try-hard effort to try and inter grate the two together, meaning, it's really only the end of the movie that kind of ties it... it's like it was either meant to be an unsuspected surprise, but with every critic already telling you it's confirmed it is a prequel, that surprise has been blown away, and the ending it self looked like it was included at last minute.<br /><br />The story is probably what you expect from seeing trailers. In 2090 or so, a couple of archeologists/explorers find a cave in Scotland with some ancient paintings on the wall that show a star system. Putting two and two together, they link this start system to a bunch of other ancient drawings from around the world and luckily have the technology to head towards those stars in hopes of discovering where mankind evolved from. When they get there, they find it has a moon orbiting a planet that has an atmosphere that is not quite breathable to humans, but it most likely is the planet they have come to explore. They land on the planet and discover a bunch of structures that they decide to go into and blah blah blah blah... outbreak.<br /><br />The characters of the movie aren't so much the reason I didn't enjoy this film. For the most part, every actor did a decent job in being a believable character. All but two actors. One being the old man who has terrible make-up, and the other being whats-his-face who played a robot (that guy from X-men First Class as Magneto) despite the bad make up of one, both characters seemed very dry and make you beleive they are planning something very sinister only to be killed off in seconds when their time comes (Well, the Robot guy doesn't die, but still), which left me thinking, \\"what was the point of all that crap building up to this then?\\"<br /><br />The other thing that brought the whole thing down was the pace. It was too slow, and focused too much on creating aCGI environment and wasting time with pointless character interactions that lead to nothing. An example of that would be the Charlize Theron's role of being something of a dull and lifeless military woman who you wonder if she is human or not, but by the end of the movie, you realize, it wasn't leading up to something with her useless scenes of showing she is heartless, no, it was just a terrible role, much like the other guy who played Magneto.. whatever his name is... dull, lifeless, almost completely pointless.<br /><br />If only Elvis was around to tell Riddley Scott that he needs a little less conversation and a lot more action, then there might have been a decent flick here, but instead, it did the cheap thing it was most likely written for, to get Alien fans to hear it's a prequel, then suck them into any old rubbish, and end it on a note that there will be a sequel to this prequel.... and I won't be wasting my time with it if it does.
B00633W614|5.0|I loved this book and am looking forward to the next, the last of the series.  By telling the story from the different characters' viewpoints the author makes it very interesting.

B00068TJM6|5.0|I ordered this on May 18, 2012. The estimated delivery date was anywhere between June 15 - July 5, but I received it on June 2 which I was really happy about. The watch looks gorgeous, it is the best watch I have seen and owned so far, can't think of any other watch that looks so majestic and classy, besides the Swiss ones. As soon as I opened it, I went through the manual and tested out the different features. The alarm worked fine. It's a feeble sound, not really that loud to be able to wake you up. I didn't really do much with the slide rule, but I will eventually fiddle with that. Adjusted the hour, second, minute, stopwatch and alarm hands. The little alarm clock at the bottom corresponds and stays parallel to the hour and minute hands at all times, unless the alarm is engaged, the only time it stays still. The second hand is on a separate dial to the left, some people don't like that, but it doesn't really matter as long as it's there and is something different from other watches. There is another minute hand on a separate dial at the top which is for the yellow stopwatch needle, it moves every time the yellow needle completes a full circle(with a nice sweeping motion) to represent the completion of a minute. The yellow stopwatch needle at first looks like the main second hand of the watch until you realize that it's not moving. The dial is black and it's beautiful, definitely much better than the picture here. It has a nice recessed dial with all the letters and numbers very clearly printed. The dial is Hardlex crystal giving it a nice dual reflection of light because of its convex shape. The hour and minute hands are luminous, haven't tested the luminosity in depth, but it's good. The bezel and band are both stainless steel. The band has a nice brushed finish on the edges and a smooth polished glossy finish in the center with a nice secure clasp. Goes great with casuals and formals, guaranteed to get attention. This is the best looking Chronograph, with features to match, in this price range. I should stop, because I could keep writing about this watch.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this trilogy.  I read all three books in about a week.  It is a fantasy yes, but oh so good to read.  Makes you want to hunt down your own Christian Grey.
B005LAIIRQ|3.0|This movie just feel flat for me. I gave it a three because Liam is one of my favorite actors and he delivered. The plot had everything going for it, but the directors/writers/editors failed to deliver that BANG effect! The plane crash and wolf attack scenes could have been sooooooooo much better. Unfortunately, blood and gore sells and excites in movies and this one missed it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An amazing, inventive, well written escape.  The best SF I have read in quite some time.  I look forward to reading the rest of his material.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Lots of fun! I don't give it 5 stars because it doesn't background right when you hit the home button. The interface is a little annoying sometimes as well: hard to hit the right square and it doesn't always correctly recognize the direction you're trying to drag.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|It seems that most of the reviews are pretty divided on this film. Some praising it as one of the greatest sci-fi films ever and others calling it one of the worst films ever. It is neither of those, it is simply meh. And, coming from a visual master like Sir Ridley Scott, that is sadly a bit of a dissapointment. I can't blame him for this as it may have been the writers but ultimately it's his movie, he signed off on it. I'll try to avoid spoilers in this review, although if you've seen most of the trailers for the film then you've already sadly been exposed to some key plot points that ultimately (for me at least) ruined the movie quite a bit. I really wanted to like this movie but it was painfully average with the plot and characters. Anyways on to the review.<br /><br />As to the whole Alien prequel thing if you've read any interviews about the film Sir Scott says this isn't a prequel and he's right. It's set in the same universe as Alien with space Jockey's and the Weyland Yutani corporation but that's about it. It's unclear exactly when the start of the film takes place but it's considerably earlier than the rest of the narrative. Again I won't spoil anything. The movie then picks up in the late 2080's as scientists discover ancient paintings in a cave in Scotland of people worshipping a larger god-like creature beholding stars. We then flash forward a few years to the ship Prometheus flying through space to an undisclosed location where we're introduced to David, the ship's android, who monitors the crew while in cryo-sleep or whatever. The crew arrives at their planet of destination, woken up, briefed on the mission, and then make their fateful trip to the surface where they find ancient alien ruins and chaos ensues. I won't ruin anything further but just get into my pros and cons.<br /><br />First of all the movie's beautifully shot and the special effects look great. It doesn't really look phony at all, the creature effects look like they captured these things and filmed them. People complained about the pacing of the film and it moves fine. It kind of stutters in the middle but it's constantly moving forward. Noomi Rapace does a great job as one of the lead scientists and Michael Fassbender did a good job as David. I also like how they try to address religious aspects although they never fully delve into it - it's just kinda there.<br /><br />Now on to the negatives. Some of the characters and plot points just didn't make sense. For the characters there's a geologist who gets into a slight tiff with a biologist early on and says he's only in this for the money. Really? You're a geologist, doing assumably what you love, and you're only doing it for the money? Makes zero sense to me. Also why are the scientists waking up, meeting each other for the first time and then briefed above the planet - wouldn't it have made more sense doing all the meet and greet prep work before you left Earth? The android David's motives are all over the place. Characters in the movie just happen to know things. Like the two scientists at the beginning explaining that the reason the Prometheus is out in the galaxy is trying to track down \\"Engineers\\" instead of little green men. How could they have possibly known these beings were engineers that supposedly created human life? Where in any of the cave paintings did it show these creatures creating mankind? Unless this was footage that was cut, and if so it had better be restored to clarify that. Also - how did primitive humans know about these engineers to paint them on cave walls? Were they visited by them on and off throughout time? Also the captain of Prometheus makes a statement about what the alien ruins actually are - again, how does he know that? To me, as a viewer, the place seems more like a biological freakshow/zoo with various types of creatures but he comes to a conclusion somehow. It later shows him to be right but at the earlier point how did he know that? Also the movie fills anice plothole by having holographic recordings of the Engineers in their last moments. This conveniently helps the David character understand the workings of the ruins. Were these holograms supposed to be a security camera system or a black box of some sort? Again - just seemed way too convenient to help the plot move along. Also the musical score was pretty generic. It's not like Goldsmith's original Alien score which was eerie and fit the atmosphere perfectly, this one's just kinda there. Also part of the end completely rips-off the original Alien movie which I felt wasn't necessary.<br /><br />Anyways never trust a critic - see it yourself. I'd recommend seeing it in the theater if you can to truly appreciate Sir Ridley's cinematography and framing of shots. It'll look great on a big screen at home but that can't compare to the theater. Arguably Ridley still has the best eye for films. Just don't expect this to be a masterpiece like Blade Runner or Alien.<br /><br />Peace

B0080CL0HM|4.0|İ expected much. Having watche previews, I expected it might have boring sequences, but it easily held my interest trhu to the end. The end could have been better, it needed something else. It starts off rather raunchy, but the interludes decline significantly halfway thru. Rob did very well in the role and I didn't even find his character that repulsive, felt kinda sorry for him, but he eventually adapts, overcomes and is model student. Perhaps this is why Mrs. Forrestier seems smug at the end. He had a good variety of expressions and situations that I haven't seen him in before and he did well, it wasn't strained and appeared well-directed  Ricci was perfect and endearing --her chemistry with Pattinson showed. Uma was good. Kristin Scott not so much. Worth watching and thinking about love vs. success and wealth.
0307716546|5.0|I think if you can get past the device Lupton uses in this novel (which I was able to), you're in for a clever and interesting take on the literary mystery. When she learns her daughter is trapped in her burning school, Grace Covey races in to save her. Ultimately, both she and her daughter wind up in the hospital, Grace with a massive head trauma, and Jenny severe burns both externally and internally. But in a somewhat reminiscent nod to, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" both Mother and daughter step outside of their bodies to witness everything that is happening in the aftermath, including the fact that Grace believes this fire was deliberate, and Jenny was it's intended victim. The book seen through Grace's eyes, spends much of the time watching her stoic husband try to wrestle with the fact he might lose two members of his family, while trying to find out what really happened in the school with the help of his police detective sister. I throughly enjoyed the ride, and appreciated that Lupton wasn't satisfied with simple resolves, but kept the story twisting right until it's bittersweet ending.
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been trying to find this app but I couldn't so I thought it wasn't for this device until I looked at recommendations for this other game and seen this
B008ASLNN2|2.0|The production values for this movie were excellent, let me start off.  The movie also brings some of the devices from the first movie which is both good and bad.<br /><br />Holmes' ability to predict the future of confrontations in slow motion is back. His aloof personality is also back.  It's a perfect role for Robert Downey Jr. and also a great character performance by Jude Law.<br /><br />However, the plot, the pace and the writing are duds.  Executive summary: a replay of the first movie with less excitement, a weaker plot and nothing to add.<br /><br />The plot centers around a contrived conflict between Dr. Moriarity and Holmes.  The basis of the conflict is, essentially, a battle of super-wits.  Later, the movie introduces an actual plot... something about Moriarity profiting and inciting a world war.  Utterly forgettable and tired.  Their conflict is also as tired as some of the scripted banter that tries to be much wittier than it actually is.  There are only three moderately developed characters (Holmes, Watson, Moriarity) and a host of forgotten supporting characters.  Even Madam Simza Heron, arguably one of the main characters, never becomes someone to care about.<br /><br />I fell asleep.  Better to watch this when it comes to Starz, while cooking dinner or folding laundry.  Definitely not one for movie night.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I can play it for hours!! I finally got to 5 million and am trying to now get 10... its so fun and you never get bored it gets fast and difficult as it progresses.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Giving this five stars because it is one of the best movies I have ever seen, definitely among my personal top 5 favorites.  You don't have to have seen the first film to enjoy this one immensely.  It's funny, cerebral, action-packed, well-written, and beautifully directed.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. shines as Sherlock Holmes - not the stuffy Englishman your grandmother was in love with, but a swashbuckling action hero with a razor-sharp mind. Jude Law is his perfect companion as the loyal and practical Dr. Watson, and Stephen Fry is absolutely astounding as Holmes' older brother Mycroft.  Last, but certainly not least, Jared Harris is chilling as the evil Professor Moriarty.  He brings every ounce of dastardly deviousness to the role and does not disappoint.<br /><br />In regards to the ultraviolet digital copy:  No, it's not iTunes. Get over it! It's still a digital copy, and you CAN download it to your computer if you meet the software requirements.  If not, you can still stream it to your iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad.  And because it's stored in the cloud, you don't have to worry about it getting lost if your computer crashes.  Oh, and another thing they won't tell you:  when you activate your Ultraviolet account, they give you another movie for free.  I got He's Just Not That Into You.  It's not necessarily what I would have chosen for myself, but I'm okay with it - and they do give the option to choose another movie if you want.<br /><br />Long story short (too late), DO NOT LET THE ULTRAVIOLET STOP YOU FROM BUYING THIS!  It's still a wonderful movie and if you don't want the digital copy, you don't have to get it.

0811879542|5.0|The Press Here book is like a videogame without any electric components. It's a revolutionary yet subtly classic throwback to the simply illustrated children's books that we all grew up with... or wish we did.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Except for the sex this is so boring! The writing is awful, the same words and phrases used over and over again. Long passages of email exchanges are tedious and dull to read. I wasn't sure if I was going to finish it or not and still haven't. It's the sort of book that's good to read when you have insomnia.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I picked up Wild with no idea what I was buying (which happens most of the time), and I'm so happy I did. I instantly read it and loved it. She writes so well and describes things to where I feel as if I'm on the trail with her. Her experiences are touching and exciting. Overall, everyone should read Wild at least once, if not over and over. Great read, great author!

0307730697|5.0|Are you looking for a hero?  A real life, tested and tried kind of hero?  Then look no further than \\"Fearless\\" by Eric Blehm.  \\"Fearless\\" chronicles the life and death of Navy SEAL Adam Brown.  Brown is larger than life but this biography shares his story with warts and all.  Just as Superman had his kryptonite, Brown struggled with drugs and reached bottom before raising himself back up to becoming a top Navy SEAL.  Now, I don't want to ruin the story for anyone so I'm not going into detail. Let me just say that there were many, many times I had to stop reading and accost the nearest family member with a \\"let me read you this bit - it's amazing\\" moment.<br />Many of Brown's own words grace the pages, taken from letters and journals.  Eric Blehm spent hours and hours interviewing people from various times in Adam's life and their reminiscences bring this heroic man to life on the page.  Adam Brown was a man who touched lives and now, after his story has ended, he is still touching lives through \\"Fearless.\\"<br /> If you are looking for a story that will uplift you, encourage you and make you glad once again that there are true heroes guarding our country, pick up a copy of \\"Fearless.\\"  In fact, with Father's Day looming, pick up two...one to keep and one to give.<br />This book was provided to me by Waterbrook Press for this review as part of the Blogging for Books Program.
B0079J28NW|5.0|Even if, like me, you're not the biggest Beatles fan in the universe, the 1968 \\"Yellow Submarine\\" remains an utter delight. Made to finish off a contractual obligation to United Artists - by which point, in the late `60s, the Beatles were no longer interested in making movies - the psychedelic feature finds John, Paul, Ringo and George whisked away from England in order to save the magical undersea kingdom of \\"Pepperland.\\" There, the music-loving inhabitants are under attack from the \\"Blue Meanies,\\" who have turned the citizens into statues. It's up to the Beatles along with \\"Old Fred\\" and his Yellow Submarine to restore color, music and life back to Pepperland, traveling through strange and surreal lands along the way.<br /><br />\\"Yellow Submarine\\" was produced by King Features and producer Al Brodax, who previously packaged a Saturday morning \\"Beatles\\" cartoon for ABC that was fairly plastic in its animation. The Beatles themselves, reportedly, stayed away from the movie during most of its production for that reason - only when they saw what was being worked on did they change their minds, agreeing to appear in a live-action sequence at the end and contributing new as well as previously-recorded songs to the soundtrack (\\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" \\"All Together Now,\\" \\"Nowhere Man,\\" \\"When I'm Sixty-Four,\\" \\"All You Need Is Love,\\" \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" are just a few of the tunes to appear throughout). Brodax, director George Dunning and his animation team keep the movie fresh and perfectly suited to repeat viewing, with each song acting like its own set-piece, and constantly changing, eye-popping colors and eclectic design keeping both kids and adults stimulated. It's an all-time animated classic that has lost none of its appeal over the years.<br /><br />Making its debut on Blu-Ray (as well as a new DVD edition) from Capitol Records/EMI, \\"Yellow Submarine\\" looks great and sounds absolutely spectacular. The DTS MA 5.1 audio is just amazing - the songs echoing into every speaker of the sound field and carrying a dynamic range that makes it one of the most effective home theater mixes I've ever heard. Though the movie's original mono mix and a PCM stereo track have also been included, neither compare to the brilliant sound design of the DTS MA mix. Visually, the AVC encoded transfer is also impressive, preserving the picture's original 1.66 aspect ratio and offering a gorgeous pallet of colors. Suffice to say, \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is one of the best looking and sounding discs I've yet seen in the format.<br /><br />Extra features aren't overwhelming, but will come as welcome inclusions for fans. In addition to a full color booklet and collectible lithographs, the most insightful supplement is a commentary track from producer John Coates with some comments from animator Heinz Edelmann, whose visual designs for the Beatles themselves proved to be the lead inspiration for the project. There's a theatrical trailer (that seems to have been \\"re-created\\" using HD footage), a vintage featurette \\"Mod Odyssey,\\" storyboard sequences, pencil drawings, behind the scenes photos, and very short (mostly 1-2 minute) interviews with Paul Angelis and John Clive (who voiced Ringo and John, respectively), animator David Livesey, Edelmann assistant Millicent McMillan, animation director Jack Strokes, and co-writer Erich Segal, who notched one of his first commercial successes a few years before his script for \\"Love Story\\" became a national phenomenon.
B0086700CM|3.0|It get a little repetative if you can't advance or get additional characters. Charging for coins on the side is kind crazy
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Ridley Scott's triumphant return to the science fiction genre may have started off as a prequel to his 1979 classic \\"Alien,\\" but PROMETHEUS is a very different type of picture: a suspenseful and captivating film with provocative concepts and thematic material that challenges the viewer as much as it satisfies on a rich aesthetic level.<br /><br />Its \\"Alien\\" aspects - and there are some - are secondary to a story that asks where the human race came from, how we got here, and where we're going. Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof's screenplay posits these eternal questions in a manner that's positively refreshing in our current age of soulless blockbusters, opening with an utterly beautiful prologue set on Earth at the dawn of time (shot in Iceland by Scott) and proceeding to follow a spaceship crew in the late 21st century setting out to uncover the answers.<br /><br />Among the crew of the ship \\"Prometheus\\" are scientists Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green, gruff captain Idris Elba, icy cold Weyland corporation exec Charlize Theron, and a curious android named David (Michael Fassbender), the work of the elderly Charles Weyland (Guy Pearce) himself, who funded the mission to track down the whereabouts of beings who left \\"calling cards\\" on ancient cave paintings around the globe. Upon arriving on a desolate planet, Rapace and company find a dank, deserted chamber with remnants of an alien race that fled the scene some time before - as well as a gooey chemical substance that's anything but benevolent.<br /><br />It's easy to see why some viewers expecting a straight-ahead \\"Alien\\" prequel may be turned off by \\"Prometheus\\": this film isn't just a variation on its predecessor, with a group of disparate characters running around in the dark from a monster. Its brilliance is due to Scott's blending of familiar genre conventions with a story line that's deeper and more involved than most viewers may be prepared for. Granted, there are times when you wish certain plot points were clarified more than they are - especially in a mid-section that seems a bit rushed - but what's left unanswered aren't so much flaws as they are concepts left intentionally dangling for viewers to further contemplate. It may be less accessible to the masses than \\"Alien\\" but it's also emotionally stronger and deeper in terms of what it's attempting to do and say.<br /><br />Rapace's sensitive performance resonates strongly here in the latter regard, giving her character an emotional vulnerability that's wholly sympathetic - not just a Ripley clone, her Elizabeth Shaw is the moral epicenter of a crew that watches as their lofty hopes of finding out where life came from turns into a nightmarish assortment of questions about why the would-be Gods are trying to destroy them. Shaw's unshakeable faith is intriguingly tested by both the circumstance the crew finds themselves in, as well as her unusual relationship with the mysterious David, whose motivations are never entirely made clear in an otherwise fine performance from Fassbender.<br /><br />Scott's penchant for amazing visuals are, of course, on-hand throughout the film, and there are a handful of dynamic set-pieces: a thrilling storm that threatens the crew is later followed by a harrowing \\"medical\\" sequence and a sensational finale with a truly miraculous sense of scale. The director said in pre-publicity that he wanted \\"Prometheus\\" to be \\"big\\" and the film is indeed that, both in the messages it develops and the visuals on-screen. Spectacular effects and haunting creatures include concepts that resemble the work of H.R. Giger, giving fans a taste of the universe that Scott first brought to the screen with \\"Alien\\" but here in a very different context. (In fact, if there's a moment that feels somewhat out of step here, it's in a quote from Jerry Goldsmith's unused main title from \\"Alien\\" that comes across as unnecessarily shoe-horned into the picture).<br /><br />Dariusz Wolski's cinematography and even the score, credited to Marc Streitenfeld but enhanced with a lovely theme by Harry Gregson-Williams that's used throughout the picture (so much that it's surprising he only received an \\"Additional Music\\" credit), are likewise effective: this is a film that's filled with so much artistic invention and memorable images that one can see sci-fi fans returning to \\"Prometheus\\" for some time to come, both to dissect its narrative as well as take in its amazing artistic design.<br /><br />Throughout his career, Ridley Scott has shown himself to be a master craftsman in terms of imagery: not just in his classics like \\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner,\\" but also in the commercial failures of \\"Legend,\\" \\"1492\\" and \\"White Squall.\\" Throughout them all, Scott has brought the beauty of nature and, indeed, different worlds and even whole universes to life, very much like an artist painting on a blank canvas. While not without its flaws, \\"Prometheus\\" ranks not only with those films visually, but has one of the most compelling story lines from any of Scott's works, as well as an emotional range that's particularly surprising at its conclusion. It's a movie that stays with you long after the credits have rolled, a film that entertains and engages, a sublime mix so rarely seen at the movies any more.

And what the heck is up with the all the OH MY's??? While I enjoyed certain aspects of this book the repetitiveness was a deal breaker. I kept reading on hoping that it would get better, but NOPE just more holy cows and gasping. Had there been more of a story line and not all sex (don't get me wrong, the sex scenes were steamy but a tad to much)this book would have gotten 5 start out of me . I would have liked.....

1250008409|5.0|I've dabbled with mindfulness over the years but honestly don't have a great grasp of it.  This book really helped me understand it and put it more into practice.  The author realizes that those of us with full minds might have trouble grasping the idea of clearing your mind.  A simple 10 minutes a day is all he asks...I can handle that.<br /><br />The author uses great analogies about \\"clearing your mind\\" and observing your environment.  I've heard many examples in the past but describing your mind as a busy road and the goal of observing the cars whizzing by really clicked with me.  Readers who have tried mindfulness before but couldn't, pardon the pun, wrap their mind around it, will find this book very approachable.  Each section also provides stories that are easily relatable to and identify the struggles we have with mindfulness.<br /><br />Unlike other books I've read on the subject, this wasn't terribly \\"preachy\\" about exactly how you should meditate or the extreme virtues of it.  This book meets you where you are on the journey and gently assists you on the way.  Lots of great exercises of short duration help you find the time and opportunity to simply be.<br /><br />My only complaint about the book, and it's slight, is the fact that US audiences might find the idioms and nuances of the British author slightly off-putting.  I giggled a little with discussions of his \\"mum\\" and spellings like behaviour and honour.  Living in Kansas, those hiccups distracted my reading a bit, but only because I yearned to watch another episode of Doctor Who or maybe the IT Crowd.<br /><br />If you've been struggling with mindfulness and found other books overwhelming and unattainable, this is the book for you.
B007ZMAL32|5.0|I've always enjoyed a good \\"Rock Opera\\" or \\"Concept Album\\", and Sabaton's 'Carolus Rex' does not disappoint.  Set during the time of the Swedish Empire, 1611-1721, this album tells the story of the rise and mysterious death of Charles XII, King of the Swedish Empire.<br /><br />I cannot point to any weaknesses in the album.  Each song has a distinct personality that compliments the progression of the story.  My favorite song, however, is \\"A Lifetime of War.\\"  The meaning for this song doesn't have to be limited to the 17th century, either.  One could easily change a few words, and have it apply to the world we currently live in.<br /><br />Sabaton's continual innovation and evolution in the Power Metal scene has helped then transcend the need to be compared to the likes of Iron Maiden, Manowar or any of the other legends of the metal/power-metal genres.  I feel that this album will propel them headlong into \\"legendary\\" status themselves, where they will only ascend higher and higher with each album.

1400052181|5.0|I bought this book because I had heard so much about it, but it sat on my shelf for over a year because so often books by journalists are dry recitations of facts and dates.  Once I started this book I could not put it down and read it in two days.  I was so pleasantly surprised to find a book not only packed with scientific information about the history and reality of cellular research but of the ethical debate thereof.  This book also had so much heart in telling the story of Henrietta and the Lacks family.  I even read the notes and acknowledgements which made it clear how incredibly deeply Rebecca Skloot researched the subjet matter. I have found a new interest in bioethics that I hadn't realized before.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone.  The scientific story effects each and every one of our lives and the human story gives us a different kind of look into our history and our present.
B003VANOFY|2.0|This headset sounds great and transmits good quality audio but that is about the only good thing I can say about it.<br /><br />Trying to turn the thing on is an exercise in frustration. A lot of the time I need to hold the power button for 20 seconds or more before it turns on and something turns itself off immediately afterward. Occasionally a really loud screeching sound begins and it will not stop even after I restart the headset. Sometimes it just will not charge, and using it plugged in, I will unplug it to move around and it will immediately tell me the power is low. The buttons on the side also cannot be mapped to push-to-talk which is how I prefer to use my headset.<br /><br />I do not recommend this headset, the audio quality is good but it is terribly unreliable and frustrating.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I've been a fan of Leonard Cohen's for over 40 years....and have enjoyed both his music and poetry immensely.  I've also seen him in concert twice.  I swear this guy just keeps getting better with age.  I bought his \\"Live in London\\" DVD about a year ago here on Amazon and it about blew me away.  Then I heard about his new CD release and figured I'd give it a shot.  It's another masterpiece and, in my opinion, one of his best if not THE best.  It's awesome.  Buy it....you won't be sorry, trust me.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Okay, so I agree, the book had some writing, editing and character development issues. But, it was nice to not go through pages of flowery fluff to get to the moment. At first, I was bothered by some of the repeated phrases - but in the end I got so wrapped up in the story that I was able to appreciate it for the simplicity. And as far as the innergodness statements - I began to look forward to the funny quips that, let's face it, we all think from time to time. I thoroughly enjoyed this book as well as the two that followed. There are some haters - I would say they are grammar snobs who can't relate to the emotions that are presented in the book.  They can't get past the writing to enjoy the story. As the book teaches us, variety is the spice of life. If all authors had the same writing technique it would be boring. People like this book because it is different and it is an easy read. Laters.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Those are my three words to describe this series.  I'm very glad that the omnibus edition was available, because it would have been maddening to wait for the next release to come out!  I came into this one completely unaware, having found it in the science fiction listings of e-books.  The summary and reviews were enough to compel me to buy it, and I wasn't steered wrong in the least.<br /><br />I love dystopian/utopian(?) fiction, since it's incredibly relevant to where we, as a species, are these days.  The plot of the book isn't remotely unimaginable; it felt completely grounded (pun intended) in reality.<br /><br />I'm on board for future releases, spin-offs, the Sci-Fi channel mini-series...
B007I2BZIE|5.0|PREFACE: Lifelong Rush fan. Canadian. Have all their albums. Last one I truly LOVED was Presto. Since then some OK songs, some not so much. Vapor Trails:  don't know because I can't hear the songs through the awful mix. S&A: Some highlights, some lowlights. Ok, all caught up. I'll proceed with my review of Clockwork Angels which I will attempt to get through without referencing any other Rush albums because they all stand on their own merit.<br /><br />As the title suggests, I almost missed out. 'Caravan' didn't do anything for me when I heard it 2 years ago. 'BU2B' was good. Saw them on the Time Machine tour and as usual they sounded great, then heard 'Headlong flight' and wasn't impressed. Because of these factors I approached the release of Clockwork Angels very cautiously. I apologetically admit the fascinating name of the album and the artwork (21:12! GENIUS!) really drew me in even though the initial 3 songs didn't. Even more apologetically I admit after first listen I was disappointed, as I sadly somewhat expected to be. (Except for 'The Garden'. More on that later.) The hooks weren't there. The melodies weren't there. The musicianship as always was brilliant, but each member seemed to be disjointed from the other 2. I heard no great Alex Lifeson Guitar riffs, no soaring melody in Geddy Lee's voice. OK, Neil Peart is always Neil Peart, but even he seemed reserved. After a second listen I was prepared to write the album off, put it on the shelf with all the other Rush albums and only listen to 'The Garden'.<br /><br />Then a funny thing happened, I woke up one morning with the riff from 'The Anarchist' stuck in my head. I even identified what song it was. I listened to it again on the way to the rink (I'm a College Hockey Coach.) and to my own surprise, melodies and memorable riffs were everywhere! I listened to it all day on repeat in my office and it got better and better each time. That's when it hit me. There's so much going on musically on this album it just takes a few listens for everything to be fully absorbed. Clockwork Angels is truly, truly brilliant. This is a work of musical art on so many different levels. As unimpressed as I was by the 3 initial singles, they seemed energized by being part of the story. (I'm gonna assume you all know the concept/story the album tells by now from all the other reviews. Cliffnotes version: Steampunk kid travels the world, experiences life love and loss, lives and learns. Can't wait for the book!) That may be the most impressive thing about this masterpiece, in today's single-driven music scene, Rush have revived the ALBUM. 12 songs that work so well together it makes the whole greater than it's parts, yet each song is so different you can't believe how well they all fit together. This is also an argument for physical CD's. I cannot imagine not having the elegiac, sweeping cover art and the lyric booklet to look at while I listen to the music.<br /><br />While 'Caravan' will never be one of my favourite Rush songs it still has layers I didn't hear 2 years ago. 'BU2B' is far better than I initially thought, and it provides the perfect launch point for the title track, an epic in itself. 'The Anarchist' features some of Alex Lifeson's best work in years, although for me, he is the star of this album. He provides whatever each song needs, sometimes understated simple riffs, sometimes aggressive, blistering, crushing licks. But each time it's EXACTLY what the song needs. While I initially thought Peart's drumming was reserved, I realized that he as well was playing what was best for the song. There are a ton of great \\"ONLY NEIL PEART\\" fills that become more evident with every listen. He's still the greatest drummer on Earth. 'Carnies' is a tremendous song very unlike whatever notion it's title may evoke, and 'Halo Effect' is one of the better simple, accoustic slower songs the band has ever done. It's touching, and it conveys that point of the story very effectively. 'Seven Cities of Gold' is HEAVY! Lifeson rips this song up from start to finish, yet Lee's bass gets a chance to really groove during the bridge. Again, Lee is forever the most underrated bassist alive. 'The Wreckers' is one of my favourite Rush songs ever. It's a great listen, very accessible, and it's got more melody in it's 5 minutes than an entire day of top 40 radio these days. Lee turns in that vocal performance that I missed initially. In a perfect world, 'The Wreckers' is a hit song. We all know this world isn't perfect, so I'll just settle for it being a close to perfect rock song. 'Headlong Flight' is propelled by a great Lee bassline and great, powerful drumming by Peart. 'Wish them well' is a great song lyrically, but along with 'Caravan' it musically is a bit below the rest of the album. I really don't know what I can say about 'The Garden'. It immediately moved me upon first listen, and has only gotten stronger since. I know it says a lot, but 'The Garden' is possibly the best song Rush has ever done. Musically beautiful, with perfect orchestration, and an emotional, powerful solo by Lifeson, one of his best ever. Lyrically, if this song doesn't stir you emotionally, you don't have a soul. I tear up everytime I hear it. It's a perfect example of what music can do for us as an artform. The notes by Peart about the song in the booklet are stirring, even moreso when you consider what he went through. I myself am battling a life-threatening illness, and the lyrics of this song resonate so strongly for me, it makes an already timeless song even more powerful. Rush fan or not, nobody should miss 'The Garden'. It is the best song this band has ever done and should quiet anyone who suggested Rush wasn't the band they once were.<br /><br /> I'm listening to this album as I write this and I'm still hearing some small flourishes within songs that I hadn't heard yet. Clockwork Angels is a masterpiece. It's an album that many Rush fans knew the band still had in them. Yes, I didn't get it at first, and I almost missed out on it's brilliance. I read all the negative reviews, and most are opinions I shared after my initial listens. It's been said this could be their last studio album, if so, they end on a higher note than most bands could EVER aspire to, (Let alone a band in its FIFTH decade, with members in their 60's!) and no other band could ever end a career with a more powerful song than 'The Garden'. Everything about this album is amazing, the songwriting, the lyrics (Peart's best ever IMO.), the musicianship, the artwork. Clockwork Angels is a masterpiece, period. Please, don't make the mistake I almost did. Get this, let it reveal itself over time, and you will in no way be disappointed.ifeson rips this song up from start to finish, yet Lee's bass gets a chance to really groove during the bridge. Again, Lee is forever the most underrated bassist alive. 'The Wreckers' is one of my favourite Rush songs ever. It's a great listen, very accessible, and it's got more melody in it's 5 minutes than an entire day of top 40 radio these days. Lee turns in that vocal performance that I missed initially. In a perfect world, 'The Wreckers' is a hit song. We all know this world isn't perfect, so I'll just settle for it being a close to perfect rock song. 'Headlong Flight' is propelled by a great Lee bassline and great, powerful drumming by Peart. 'Wish them well' is a great song lyrically, but along with 'Caravan' it musically is a bit below the rest of the album. I really don't know what I can say about 'The Garden'. It immediately moved me upon first listen, and has only gotten stronger since. I know it says a lot, but 'The Garden' is possibly the best song Rush has ever done. Musically beautiful, with perfect orchestration, and an emotional, powerful solo by Lifeson, one of his best ever. Lyrically, if this song doesn't stir you emotionally, you don't have a soul.

0307951529|4.0|I'm in my forties and I work from home because my husband owns his own company. At the beginning of every job, there is a flurry of paperwork then not much for me to do really except \\"gopher\\" until the end of the job when there is a bit more paperwork to do. This just isn't enough for me and honestly, I want something to call my own but I don't want to go back to working for someone else plus, I live in a rural area and my options for working for someone else aren't that great. I could maybe teach (if I wanted to wait a minimum of another decade before I got a full time position) or be someone's secretary or the like. There just aren't a lot of industries around here that might facilitate having an actual career.<br /><br />Reading this book gave me lots of ideas of what I can do using my own talents and really got me excited about the possibilities of just what I can accomplish and it gave me a sense of \\"if they can do it, so can I\\" confidence.<br /><br />I'm already implementing some of my ideas and even if I don't get rich, it would be wonderful to have a job I really enjoy and something that is wholly my own.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. I'm so glad I read it. It gave me that extra push to at least TRY.

B0074MZSPO|5.0|When it comes to the subject of music, the state of Alabama has been front and center in a lot of ways. The Southern area has produced various music legends in a variety of genres and has a rich legacy of recorded music and recording studios. Continuing on that tradition is the Athens band Alabama Shakes. The quartet is comprised of singer/guitarist Brittany Howard, drummer Steve Johnson, lead guitarist Heath Fogg and bassist Zac Cockrell. They originally got their start when Brittany and Zac were in high school and ended up writing songs together. They later added two other musicians to complete the lineup and the Alabama Shakes were born. They recorded a four song EP that was released on the website Bandcamp, which lead them to being invited to play at the CMJ festival. From there, they signed with Dave Matthews' ATO Records label and released their debut \\"Boys & Girls\\".<br /><br />On their album, they produced the album themselves with help from recording and mixing engineer Andrija Tokic. The sound of their debut is very reminsicent of the Southern soul and Southern rock that permeated the airwaves in the early 70's. The Muscle Shoals sound is very prevalent on \\"Boys & Girls\\" from the first note to the last song. They start the album off with the first single \\"Hold On\\", a song where lead singer Brittany sings about being blessed to be alive. They sing of being happily devoted in love on the Otis Redding inspired \\"I Found You\\" and lift someone's spirits by going on a vacation on \\"Hang Loose\\". They sing of being homesick on \\"Rise To The Sun\\" and gets a lover to show their emotions on the ballad \\"You Ain't Alone\\". On the brief \\"Going To The Party\\", they insist on going out despite the other person's objection and experience the pain of heartache on the ballad \\"Heartbreaker\\". On the title track \\"Boys & Girls\\", they lament over the demise of a friendship and sing of becoming a different person on \\"I Ain't The Same\\". Overall, Alabama Shakes' \\"Boys & Girls\\" is an excellent freshman debut from the Southern foursome. Though they just released this album, chances are you may be hearing about them the whole year.lent freshman debut from the Southern foursome.

The author starts with a great idea - using your swatch to try out new techniques, and how to measure out the yarn for your Long Tail Cast On, something that has bugged me for years. I'm thrilled with this book! One of the few cast-ons I know is in here too - check out Jeny's Surprisinging Stretchy Cast-on, along with a bunch of decorative cast-ons and bind offs. I have been knitting for years and never knew all these existed - it is a new world of fun things to try!!

B007SGM084|3.0|Where to begin ...<br /><br />If you have never experimented with (or actually prefer) kinky sex, this series of books will delight you by making you feel a little naughty.  They're going to at least make you think beyond the missionary position in the dark.  For those of us who already enjoy \\"shades of grey\\" when it comes to our sex lives, it was downright disappointing.<br /><br />Perhaps my biggest disappointment in this series was the portrayal that because Christian liked kinky sex, and was unapologetically an alpha male, he had to be \\"abnormal\\".  Anastasia, the main female character is cutesy and will appeal to many.  Unfortunately, her \\"inner goddess\\" and biting her lip become very old, very quick.<br /><br />The sex scenes are steamy at first but also get old - since they happen about every three pages.  The author changes up where they happen, but they all start sounding the same.<br /><br />These books are an OK read; unfortunately, they're also an expensive one.  If you can get your hands on inexpensive paperback copies of them, do so.  They're definitely not worth the $30.00 you're going to pay to download them.

B000S0YL2U|5.0|\\"Underclass Hero\\" is easily MY favorite Sum 41 Album (as a whole).<br /><br />The album is completely different compared to their older albums. The first two albums, \\"Half Hour of Power\\" and \\"All Killer No Filler\\" were Pop-Punk, \\"Does This Look Infected?\\" was Punk-Rock(?), \\"Chuck\\" was Alternative/Metal, while Underclass Hero is... I guess Sum 41's Version of Pop?<br /><br />Listening to the album reminds me of Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" as they both are \\"anti-society\\" and \\"anti-government\\". \\"Underclass Hero\\" is more Pop while \\"American Idiot\\" was Rock.<br /><br />My Favorite Songs on the Album are: Underclass Hero, Walking Disaster, Speak Of The Devil, Count Your Last Blessings, March Of The Dogs, With Me, Pull The Curtain, and Confusion and Frustration in Modern Times. Basically half of the album!<br /><br />\\"Take a Look At Yourself\\" is pretty good too, reminds me of My Chemical Romance's \\"Welcome to The Black Parade\\". Only problem is that it's a Bonus Track on iTunes, and you can't buy it individually; you have to buy the whole album on iTunes (not really worth it but I did it anyway). The other Bonus Track, \\"Look At Me\\" is pretty good too, but the music doesn't even start until 2 minutes through the song. It's just empty noise until the 2 minute mark. On the bright side, it's included on the Disc Version.<br /><br />To be honest, the DVD is nice but I didn't really care for it.
034580404X|5.0|I loved the whole series.  I bought the first one out of curiosity and had to buy the rest!  It made me laugh, cry, and buzz with anticipation. The story line was amazing and I loved the ending.
0062119044|5.0|What is it like to be truly ambiguous about your own child? I personally think that you must have one to completely understand and answer that question but Lionel Shriver, childless herself, nevertheless drives that question home with a ferocity and intensity in this insanely introspective and marvelously erudite work `We Need to Talk About Kevin.'<br /><br />Ever since that fateful April 20th, 1999 day, many works, hoping to better understand or analyze Columbine, have soared across the literary scene, most viewed from either the killer's or the immediate victim's perspective. This work, although certainly seen from our protagonist's point as a victim, is an overview completely unique to this genre. Eva Khatchadourian, a mother to (even for this type of crime) a rather evil and over the top school shooter, provides an insightful tale of her initially loving marriage and challenging work life. Comfortable with the realization that she does not want children, she nevertheless accommodates her husband Franklin by having a child, `Kevin.' Now, in a series of letters post crime to Franklin, Eva expounds on her miserable life bringing up Kevin while experiencing her marriage fall apart because of it.<br /><br />Rich in detail and exposition, Shriver drills into the complexities of motherhood and spousal relationships with an insight and nuance that I've rarely read. Like her literary hero Edith Wharton, every sentence, although brilliantly flowing and lucid, says something...nothing is wasted here. I was overwhelmingly impressed with her explanatory abilities and her emotional elucidations all while keeping the narrative interesting. This woman can WRITE and this is a true literary page turner.<br /><br />The storyline details themselves are wonderful and the novel captures the `bestseller' crowd with a completely unforeseen ending. For criticisms, I would only say that the Kevin and Franklin characters were a little too contrived...Kevin was pure evil right from the start and Franklin was too emotionally supportive of him, at the risk of his marriage, also right from the start. There seemed to be absolutely no flexibility in either. Shriver though, an immensely intelligent woman, may have done this purposely to leverage her character's emoting and to drive the final outcome to its inevitable conclusion. Although seemingly large as it pertains to two of the important main characters, this criticism gets buried when taken into the context of the crime and the ending and therefore does not detract too much nor deviates from the overall point in my view.<br /><br />A substantial and consequential book, I will go so far as to say that it's the best I've read since Jeffrey Eugenides `The Marriage Plot' and Lionel Shriver has instantly become one of my top three authors with this work. I certainly look forward to reading other works in her catalogue and highly recommend this one.rt and Franklin was too emotionally supportive of him, at the risk of his marriage, also right from the start.

B007KAJG3K|5.0|I want to show another side to the person who is upset about having no digital copy for plane trips,etc. I feel where you are coming from, but here is what happened to me with digital copies I have purchased. I had over 14 movies on my laptop and one day on a trip the laptop crashed. I got a new laptop and tried to put the digital copies I had purchased on the computer and the agreement does not extend to a new computer. So all 14 movies I purchased are gone for good. I would have to purchase them all over again. So just for me I don't want to purchase and download digital copies that are going to expire when my computer does. We need a copy that can be seen both ways. Streaming and digital copy on computer. If you buy a streaming movie from Amazon you can download it to your computer as well as have it on streaming. Check that out and see if that might work for you. Wishing everyone happy viewing....Yes I love this movie lots of action. Even old folks love it. Smile
B004WR125O|1.0|I purchased this adapter in hopes that i could use my wifi rather than a cat5 cable to network and stream music from the my reciever which is a TX-NR509, as well as control it from my iphone. Any time i connect to pandora or any of the other internet music providers i get a message saying it could not play the music. It connects to the service, but does not play music. I then tried to access the receiver using an onkyo iphone app. The app is a peice of crap considering it does not even have my receiver listed as a model, however onkyo claims you can use the app with the TX-NR509. In any case this seems to be a bust. I would not recommend this product save yourself the $20-$30 and hardwire it to your network. I have yet to try the hardwire, but i would hope to see better results.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy is great.  I couldnt hardly put the books down to get stuff done around the house.  I don't know if any other book has compared to these.

B005HEW7JG|5.0|Capitan Janeway, well she's got some...courage lol. I've already watched the whole 7 seasons twice! That's how much I like it. Ensign Kim, Seven, the doctor and, of course, the Capitan made it interesting, in my opinion. A lot of spacial distortions, mean nebulas, borg encounters and holodeck problems. Prepare to see the temporal prime directive be violated over and over again. Finally races other than Klingons, Romulans and Cardassians. More planetary systems. Less politics.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|Well after all the hype I simply had to read Fifty Shades of Grey. I was warned that some of the content could be seen as somewhat sexually graphic in nature, however to be honest it was nowhere near as bad as I was lead to believe.  This is by no means a great literary masterpiece and can be very very repetative at times however it can also be strangely compeling.  Yes it does suck you in and you simply have to read the other two books if only to see where exactly this all ends up, sadly though it seems highly possible there could be another after the current 3. Is this the worst book I have read? definitely not, is it the best? hell no, I would recommend it as a saucy read but it is not for everyone.

Would I have the same problem if I bought the app at the $15 price?<br />Also 8 now have a permanant shortcut to the upgrade page every time I go on the web with my kindle fire. I have tried deleting the page, restarting the kindle and erasing browser history...but still have that problem. So lets  say I click on my facebook app, 2 windows will open, 1 for facebook and the other for the upgrade page.<br /><br />I have tried contacting them and still no answer.<br />But I have to say that I am happy with the way it works. I don't use it for business or Any thing complex. But for the word documents I do use, it shows it exactly as it would on my PC.

Honestly, after I finished it all I could think was : Why did this bomb again? I would recommend someone to watch this and I would also watch a sequel. The acting was fine, plot was good, characters funny at times, and CGI well done. I haven't read the books yet, but they're free to read on project gutenberg. This is a story that is over 100 years old. That in itself is impressive. Very creative thinking for that long ago. Anyways, what do I know! To each his own.

B004RE29WW|1.0|That this movie was directed by David Fincher continues to amaze me, since it is superficial, predictable, and simply bad. Killing off 2 of the main characters from Aliens before the opening credits is unforgiveable.
B0040ZN9WM|1.0|We live near a Crocs store and were excited to discover this very cute style of Crocs.  We had our toddler daughter fitted at the store to be sure we had the right size and even purchased them in two colors.  We quickly discovered that all that glitters is not gold.  The hinge from the top \\"mary jane\\" strap actually pivots and rubs the inside of little feet when wearing them without socks. Our daughter had very severe blisters on the inside of both feet in the same location.  We should have stayed with the original model of Crocs.  Will never purchase this style again.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I am a fan of the Alien universe series and knew I would have to watch and would probably wind up buying this one too. Well I saw it on opening day and found it to be a worthy addition to the franchise so I've pre-ordered the 3-D version and look forward to getting it when it becomes available. There are a number of unanswered questions the film leaves the viewer wondering about and I hope that I find some clues on my second viewing when the disc comes in.<br /><br />The movie itself is about a discovery which promises to reveal important information about the origins of man. An expedition is sent across space to try and uncover more truths about this discovery. What they find turns into a challenge for their survival as very unfriendly forces are unleashed which must be defeated or the crew from earth will all suffer death.<br /><br />The movie ends just as the story takes a new direction which is setting up the audience for a sequel. Should that one get made I'll probably get it too for my \\"Alien\\" collection. Although this story takes place in the familiar alien universe it is pre-Ripley and not directly related to the older movie, \\"Alien.\\" The story line is similar in that a strong female personality survives adversity and an aberrant android with a hidden agenda complicates life for all of his unsuspecting shipmates.<br /><br />The movie was actually less violent than the previews of coming movies that were shown before \\"Prometheus\\" started. This is one of those sci-fi action flicks that are reasonably cerebral with sufficiently toned down violence to avoid running off the non-fan of the franchise.<br /><br />We found the movie satisfying and entertaining and I look forward to seeing it again. I recommend the movie for the fan of the franchise as well as general sci-fi action movies.
0307716546|4.0|AFTERWARDS<br /><br />A school is on fire.  You locate your young son, but you don't see your teenaged daughter.  Suddenly, you realize she must be in the burning school building.  What would you do?  You would probably do what Grace did -- run into the smoke, flames, heat, and dire conditions to do anything you could to save your daughter's life.<br /><br />This is the premise of the new Rosamund Lupton book, AFTERWARDS.  After the fire, Grace and her daughter, Jenny, are both critically injured and in the hospital.  The two women realize that they have 'left' their damaged bodies and can communicate with each other.  No one else can see or hear them.  Thus, the story is told by these two souls.<br /><br />This is a gripping who-dun-it as Grace tries to solve the mystery as to who would have caused the fire at Sidley House School.  Grace tells her story, talking to her husband and observing others who surround her and are involved in her life.<br /><br />Does Grace ever find out how the fire was started?  Do Jenny and Grace survive their awful life-threatening injuries?  Who is trying to murder Jenny while she is still in the hospital?  Read this emotion-packed and exciting book and find out.<br /><br />This is a clever mystery/suspense story, with enough twists, turns, and surprises to make any reader of this genre happy.  At times the writing seemed a little awkward and choppy, but the story line and characters more than make up for that.<br /><br />A mother's love knows no boundaries as this book proves.  Told in an utterly different aspect, this is one book that most would enjoy.  This reader looks forward to reading Lupton's first effort, SISTER.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pam

0385523912|5.0|This was my first time reading about North Korea (other than newspapers). The book will definitely grab you and keep you wanting to know what happens to these people that made it out (and those that didn't). It gives you some really good background/history on the demise of their economy. My heart hurts for these people that are stuck there and the countless that have died unnecessarily.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|Mike is an articulate writer. His program makes sense and can be followed with ease. It isn't easy however and I can see that I will be gaining what I need by following what he suggests. What I really like about Mike and his books is that he doesn't change his tune about things. Some things get repeated from other books, but he is consistant. He is also not sponsored by any corporation so he isn't trying to sell product. He is also accessable. If you email him, he responds.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I think Doodle is a very fun game for all ages. You can set the child proof mode if there is a child or the adult mode which is for adult content. There are plenty of combanations to combine! Hope you enjoy this app as much as I do!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I was very reluctant to watch this movie.  Since it was made by Disney I thought it was going to be a kids movie and/or too much like Avatar (the movie trailers had the green men fighting in battle and very much look Avatarish).  This movie is just as good if not better than Avatar, but John Carter is a fantastic movie indeed!  When the movie ended, it left me wanted much more (over and above the 2hrs+ time).  I would highly recommend this movie to any action/adventure AND Sci-Fi movie fan.

B0049VGTGA|3.0|I think I can explain why some people hear a big difference with this CD, but most people don't. It's because there's actually 2 standard versions of Face Value. The original CD was horrible, which is why it was silently remastered by Barry Diament - this was back in the days before record companies realised remasters could allow them to sell the same album over and over again.<br /><br />Anyway, all current CDs are the Barry Diament remaster, and have been for years. Both he and Steve Hoffman (the mastering engineer for this gold CD) mastered it in exactly the same way: straight from the master tape without any equalisation. This is actually a very unusual thing to do - most master tapes benefit from a little tweaking at the mastering stage, which is why we have mastering engineers in the first place. And personally, I think Face Value would benefit from it too, as good as it may be.<br /><br />I still bought this, as I thought the advances in digital conversion since Barry did it would still result in an improvement. However, they do indeed sound nearly identical, and in fact I slightly prefer the original. The cymbals are a little sharper on the original - check out the beginning of \\"This Must Be Love\\".  This is the opposite of what I expected, given the excellent cymbal sound Hoffman got when he worked for DCC. It seems to me he's been somewhat asleep at the wheel with his Audio Fidelity remasters - his version of Yes' 90125 was mastered in the same way as this, and it's the worst sounding version you can buy.<br /><br />The bottom line? Unless you have a gold fetish, save your money and stick with Barry Diament mastered standard CD.
B00802JMPO|5.0|Great book for adults. You won't be able to put this book down. It is going to be hard to follow this trilogy with another book. Cannot wait to see who they cast as Christian in the movie.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Generally you either love Rush or hate them. For whatever reason, some people don't \\"get them\\" of the quality and variety of their work. So be it.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />If you want to see what 38 years of musicianship, craftsmanship, and striving to be better gets you in the world of rock, I can think of no better illustration than 'Clockwork Angels.' It is singularly their best work, and I dare say, better even than '2112.' From the opening chords of \\"Caravan,\\" which pushes you into the intriguing and introspective steampunk world of the album, feeling the steady thrum of Geddy's bass, counter-pointed with the thunder of Neil's drums, and overlain with the siren song of Alex's guitar, right through the final dying, plaintive notes of \\"The Garden,\\" you are wrapped up and enthralled in a sonic exploration of an amazing and vibrant world.<br /><br />What is even better, is that while each and every song glues this world together, taking any one song out of the context of the album does not diminish them, but opens them even more relevant interpretation in today's society. This multi-textural form of music is simply astonishing to feel rolling through your mind with every beat, punch, and jam.<br /><br />And to top it off, the band does something it may not have done since the days of 'Fly By Night' or 'Caress of Steel' -- the band cuts loose. At once the most proficient purveyors and players of their instruments in all of musicdom, the band seems to feel enough freedom, joy, and above all, confidence, to pour themselves into every song with a barely-contained reckless abandon, that makes it sound like they are a band of twenty-somethings fresh to the circuit again.<br /><br />If you are looking for rock-and-roll that rocks, thunders, jams, and impresses, you could do far worse than Clockwork Angels. Rush has built a masterpiece for the 21st Century.
B0074V3712|5.0|The detail is well offset by the intelligent and careful delivery. For me it described and backed with research a fascinating look into you and me and the world in which we find ourselves.
0765316994|2.0|Chalk me up as another fan of John Scalzi who was excited at the prospect of reading a pastiche of Star Trek from the inside out and I wasn't disappointed in that. In the main it reminded me of GalaxyQuest: a pastiche written with obvious affection for the source material as well as familiarity with its foibles and peccadilloes (seriously, why aren't there seat belts on the bridge?). There are also some interesting moments of philosophy and metafiction as the characters wrangle with the idea of being characters and I was really happy to read the moments when the weirdness on board the Intrepid was noted by almost everyone.<br /><br />It was light, entertaining and it was a fun read for the commute on two days.<br /><br />And then the ending.<br /><br />The three codas have more emotional depth and pathos than most of the rest of the book. It's unfortunate, then, that they're about characters we've only had a fleeting association with up to that point. It's fitting to the theme of the book. After all, they have been the red shirts of Redshirts so there should be time to see where they're left after the main narrative is over.<br /><br />I just wish I cared about them. Or that Scalzi had taken similar care to give the heroes of the book a similarly satisfying conclusion rather than the hurried and somewhat crude finale they got. Again, it fits thematically as Dahl and his companions are characters in a serial narrative that doesn't allow for closure (any more than your average episode of Star Trek) but after reading the book I was much more curious about them than ever I was about these secondary and tertiary characters.<br /><br />By all means, if you're a fan of Scalzi, read it if you can get it on the cheap or check it out from the library. But maybe you should ignore that last fifth of the book.

B0053O89JM|4.0|The long-running medical drama's final season picks up with House facing the consequences of Season 7's destructive act against his ex-girlfriend Dr. Lisa Cuddy -- he's in prison, where we learn he's been the better part of the last year.<br /><br />Although House is no longer a doctor, his basic nature means he's unable to stay away from puzzles, especially when they concern medicine -- meaning, House is a frequent visitor to the prison clinic. In the season premiere, \\"Twenty Vicodin,\\" Dr. Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) is a bit wary at times, but despite the reasons for House's being there, Adams quickly deduces that this man is a medical genius from whom there's lots to learn.<br /><br />After much wangling on the part of House's former team member Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) - who is now the Dean of Medicine, taking over for Cuddy - House is able to work at the hospital again. The only problem is, he no longer has a team - during the past year, everyone scattered to other parts of the hospital. Foreman also refuses to give House a departmental budget. But of course, being House, neither is much of an obstacle for him. He lures Adams away from her prison job to come work for him for free (for the time being), and also acquires Dr. Chi Park (Charlyn Yi), a hesitant young Asian woman who seems to have lost favor in her old department due to a surprising act, and now needs to find another position ASAP.<br /><br />After a time, House also persuades his old team members Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) to return.<br /><br />Karolina Wydra also returns as House's green card wife Dominika, the two forging something like a real relationship as they get caught by immigration officials and must live together to convince everyone of their sincerity.<br /><br />After several seasons where Chase was almost part of the background, it was refreshing to see the charismatic Australian land a few meatier stories throughout the season, including a strange but intense relationship with an ailing young nun, and a patient who attacks him with a knife and nearly kills him, causing serious physical damage and some emotional, as the experience forces Chase to really think about his life.<br /><br />But in the end, House's entire existence always boils down to one thing -- his longtime best friend Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard). Throughout all of House's madness, the long-suffering Wilson has been the voice of reason, and on occasion, his partner in crime. No matter who else comes or goes in House's life, he can always count on Wilson to be the one solid and consistent. Yet a shocking development suddenly rears its ugly head in the final episodes, and House is forced to confront the possibility that he may indeed be alone in the end. Can House possibly survive? Or, the bigger question seems to be, would House even WANT to?<br /><br />While viewers have voiced all sorts of opinions and speculations about this final season, and largely the very end depicting House's future, one thing is certain -- this show is one that won't be forgotten any time soon.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Like others, I was intrigued by the subject matter, yet skeptical because of the controversy.  An interesting foray into a genre that I normally would not venture into, but because it was so mainstream, I had rather enjoyed the journal.  Illicit, sensual, forbidden, all of which were taboo markers for me.  Overall, an enjoyable read for water cooler discussions on Monday morning, but only under whisper.

6304806434|5.0|Con Air is a late 90s action packed movie directed by Simon West (Mechanic 2011,Expendables 2). The movie stars Nicolas Cage,John Malkovich,John Cusack,Dave Chapelle,Danny Trejo,Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi,Mykelti Williamson(Forrest Gump,Heat),Rachel Ticotin (Man on Fire,Total Recall),Nick Chinlund (Training Day,Tears of the Sun,Chronicles of Riddick),MC Gainey (Wild Hogs,Beerfest).<br /><br />  An army ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) released from active duty gets out and meets his wife at her job at a bar.He is confronted by local drunk customers and ends up killing one of them in self defense.Poe pleads guilty thinking he will do less time and spends ten years in prison.the day of his parole,he is transported in an aircraft with other convicts that have done worse crimes.The convicts have an inside plan on how to get control of the airplane and escape.It is up to Poe and the help of the DEA and US Marshalls to let Cyrus the Virus(John Malkovich) achieve his plan.<br /><br />  Con Air is a summer movie full of action from all types of weapons,airplanes,hand to hand,vehicles.There is also a lot of comedy involved with the characters,especially the convicts.With a budget of 75 million and a worldwide gross of 224 million worldwide.It is a succesful well appreciated movie.At the time Nic Cage was  barely a leading actor with low budget movies before National Treasure,Face off,Gone in 60 seconds.This was the movie that made him a leading man after The Rock He sports a long hair with a receding hairline looking masculine and only Jean Claude Van Damme's mullet in Hard Target,David Spade's mullet in Joe Dirt can compete.John Malkovich plays an extremely intelligent  villian that has educated himself in prison who is both sarcastic and deadly.Probaby one of his best career performances.John Cusack does well as a bookworm US Marshall who is very intelligent and finds out the prisoners moves.He has been around since the 80s and has done all type of movies like drama,comedy,action.With an all star cast that later their career took off like Steve Buscemi in Boardwalk Empire,Dave Chapelle in Dave Chapelle Show,Danny Trejo in  Machete,Ving Rhames in Mission Impossible movies.Simon West has great editing in cinematography,action scenes and explosions that will give Michael Bay a run for his money.It is not a movie to be taken seriously not 100% realistic but it is almost two hours of great escapism with guilty pleasure fun.Simon West has already wrapped up production in summer of 2012 for the Expendables sequel.Let's see if he is able to top Con Air. The world will find out in August.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I really like Dan Brown books and have found them all to be the kind of books you can't put down. Out of the five books of his that I have read (Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, Lost Symbol, Digital Fortress and Deception Point) I thought this one was the most enjoyable. I believe all of his books are 5-star worthy, but if you must read one, this one is my favorite.
0439023521|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how GOOD this book was, and I honestly couldn't put it down once I started.  It wasn't quite the bloodbath I was anticipating either, as only one character that I truly liked was killed (I was admittedly expecting far, far more).  I sill classify it as a \\"downer\\", though, as I felt a little drained and brokenhearted upon reaching the end.  There is certainly a place for books like that though!  And this is one of the better ones!  A very, very good read!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|The game is fun and extremely challenging and it is very addicting. I am very tired<br />and can not put it down. I do not like the fact that you must keep purchasing add on pieces to enhance the game
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|One too many Hunger Games stories. Not enough new material to make this a successful endeavor. Seems as though I've read it all before.
B0072BNSH2|5.0|although missing a few classic tracks such as electrobank, this concert film is still perfect.  the flow of the music, the visuals, the audience all work together to tell sone sort of story.  what that story is depends on the viewer.  my only suggestion, play very loud!
193418070X|2.0|I listened to this on audiobook, which is truly terrible. I enjoyed the different actors playing the speaking parts (especially the woman who played Katsa, I felt, was very talented). But the MUSIC is laughable at times.<br /><br />The book itself was pretty good at first. I was actually enjoying the characters, which might have been in part because of how well they were played by the actors on the audiobook. But after about the end of part one, it just begins to drag. The book spends AGES describing the hunting and survival stuff that the characters endure, which is tedious. I was complaining to someone about the characters going on and on through these mountains. I then actually fell asleep, and woke up to them finally reaching their destination. I missed nothing. If it is possible to sleep through entire sections of your book and not miss anything, you need to omit those portions of your book.<br /><br />After the (rather stereotypical) bad guy is defeated, the book DOES. NOT. END. It goes on, and on, with long, fanfiction-esque scenes involving the characters' relationships. The plot of the book had ended, but the author continued to drag the story on unnecessarily.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first eight hours of the audiobook (despite the horrifying music), but the second eight hours were tedious and painful.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The cover keeps my Kindle in very good condition. I like that the front of the cover can either fold back like a book or it can fold into a stand. The elastic strap is also good for keeping the cover closed.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|So I started this book at my \\"local\\" Barnes and Noble a few months back. I liked the first few pages, and it seemed to have good reviews... so I bought it for kindle. Here I am, finally at summer time (teacher, here), finishing my first book of summer. My overall feeling? Meh.<br /><br />I didn't realize until it was done that what I really liked was the feeling of the book in the beginning. The spooky-academia of Oxford, the overall educated but creepy feeling given by the subject matter and characters: these gave a great starting mood. But the plot didn't carry. In fact, I ended up skipping several parts simply because I was looking for the plot to advance. Silly me. Emotional baggage from the characters is waaaay more important than researching the book that everyone is trying to kill them for.<br /><br />In the end, I realized that what I liked was how this book hearkened to The Historian in feel. But it is much more poorly put together. The \\"evil\\" character in the beginning of the book ends up  being the romantic lead (I liked him better conflicted), and the \\"bad guy\\" is some two dimensional, murdering hack. Or perhaps a bevy of murdering hacks. But boring, murdering hacks, for sure.<br /><br />To top it off, this is the first in a stinking series, which I did not realize (my fault, not the publishers). But I really, really don't like getting  to the \\"end\\" of the book, only to find it's just the middle of the book.<br /><br />Overall, it is well written. This is not your eighth grade paranormal romance; the vampires don't sparkle. But it is certainly not what I wish I had ended my year-long drought on. Sigh.<br /><br />(*)>
0553386794|2.0|The writing style is so vague and the characters are so flat! Sure, the plot is interesting, but there really isn't much emotional development or tension. The T.V. series is more interesting than the book, and that being said I didn't even like the T.V. series that much either. I never feel like I properly know any of the characters besides Dani. I wonder if it's because there are SO many viewpoint characters and some of them are boring to read from the heads of. I don't know, but I purchased this book because of the hype and WASN'T impressed.
B006W33UC4|5.0|After listening to this impressive four-CD set, there is no doubt that Tom Moulton remains a musical genius — expanding upon the Philly sound to a level of rhythmic ecstasy. The O'Jays, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, People's Choice and The Three Degrees break through the speakers in Moulton's brilliantly extended mixes. An essential collection, with too many highlights to mention. Personal favorites: &#34;I Love Music,&#34; &#34;Don't Leave Me This Way,&#34; &#34;Back Stabbers,&#34; &#34;Dirty Old Man&#34; and the landmark &#34;Do It Any Way You Wanna.&#34;
B0087HT36U|5.0|this game is sweet.  I want to play the cowboy one soon.  keep on making fun games like this one.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So, here's the thing - normally, I can deal with horrible books if they're horrible but still kind-of good in a cheesy sort of way.  Or maybe just kind-of so bad they go full-circle and become good BECAUSE they're bad.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book is just plain old, every day terrible.<br /><br />The prose is juvenile - the author writes on a middle-school level at best, and at worst has thrown in the puberty-induced nuances of hormone fueled, faux sexiness that has been heralded as 'kinky and erotic' but is, in actuality, vague and in fact more often than not quite boring and repetitive.  It deeply saddens me that young women are reading 'literature' like this (and I use the word literature very loosely) and might think that this is how any sort of relationship is meant to work be it in the BDSM lifestyle or otherwise.  Personally knowing people that are deeply involved with the scene, thankfully most will at least gladly educate you if you ask.<br /><br />As well, the completely vapid main character, 'Ana' has the most deplorable inner-dialogue that I have had the displeasure of reading in my life.  \\"Oh he looked so yummy.\\"  What kind of adult woman thinks in this way?  And what's with the bizarre references to her 'inner-goddess'?  And the chin-grabbing, and lip-biting, and the running-hands-through-hair... and really, need I go on?<br /><br />This entire work is nothing but lazy, ham-fisted crap plagiarized from Twilight but with more sex and less Mormons.  But I'm sure if you're reading my review here then you already know that, anyway.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I just got my Kindle Fire yesterday so I thought I could get a new YouTube app. truth is, I really should have read the reviews before I downloaded this app. First, the videos and songs would never play. They would just sit there. After a while of getting used to this, I got on the app one more time and I got a MALWARE virus on my brand new Kindle. the virus made my Kindle<br /><br />super slow<br />run out of battery faster<br />crash on every app<br />flash black and white when not in use<br />tell the wrong time<br />and would not delete after hours of trying<br /><br />So if you are thinking about getting a YouTube app, I highly reccomend not getting this one.
0316023744|4.0|I really like his style. I learned lot of things that I was not aware before, but what really bugs me was completely missing war in Yugoslavia between 1941 and 1945. It is not that Beevor does not know anything about it. He clearly does as it is obvious from his notes about two resistance movements, collaborators and such, but on other hand his off hand comment that military coup in 1941 that removed government that signed pact with Nazis was caused by \\"irritation of Germans hunger for raw materials\\". Really?<br /><br />I fully understand that Yugoslavia was small country in big war, but he mentioned more Duch resistance movement.

It has a great no slip texture, is lightweight, simple in design and protects the KF well.  Other covers are so bulky they do a disservice to the electronic readers, tablets etc.  Not this cover.  If you are looking for something that will protect without adding bulk, weight, or distracting features, I highly recommend this cover.  Marware - please make one like this for all the kindles and thank you for your innovative, well thought out design :)
B002V091IO|3.0|A meditative reflection on a uni relationship, a little lacklustre at times and far too long and repetitive and ultimately predictable at the end.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I have waited for 50 years to see an Edgar Rice Burroughs \\"Barsoom\\" novel made into a movie and this exceeded all of my expectations. The way Director Andrew Stanton combines the CGI effects into the live action is incredible. I never thought anyone could bring the Green Martians to \\"life\\", but Stanton did. This movie has everything you could want in a Sci-Fi epic: adventure, romance, alien creatures, mind-boggling special-effects, a beautiful Princess, and a swash-buckling hero. It is beyond my understanding how this movie got labelled a \\"Flop\\". The DVD comes with bonus extras including: \\"100 Years In The Making\\" which follows the journey of Burroughs' story from it's origins as a \\"Pulp\\" novel in 1912 to the present. My request to Disney is: Take Me Back To Barsoom!
B000VSYDRM|4.0|This film is  beautifully directed and is perfectly creepy. I especially loved, and was disgusted by the beginnings of our main character. The scenes are putrid and evoke a pitiful love for the young man abused by life. The interesting fashion in which he becomes a serial killer is almost sad. This film is a period piece that is beautiful and scary all at the same time.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Great little flash.  Love the compact size.  It puts out more light than you think.  The quality of my indoor pictures improved 10 fold, literally!  Bounce the flash head off the ceiling and you can get some amazing portraits.  Would definitely recommend over the SB900 as it is way too bulky.
1594202842|5.0|This book was an easy, conversational read. It is the memoir of a Chinese American woman born of immigrant parents and how she raised her children the \\"Chinese\\" way even in American society and what she learned. It seems like an honest memoir. I don't know why people were sending this woman hate mail. It was her story, her life. They would not want anyone telling them how to raise their children. So who are they to say that she raised her children wrong? I believe she did an excellent job. Her girls are achievers who know their self worth and know that they are capable of anything and everything. I'm impressed with the author's tenacity and love for her girls. Just reading through this I'm wondering how much sleep she was able to get. How she ever really had any time for anything else. But I believe she put the emphasis on the right things for her daughters. I would be doing well to have a third of the passion she has for her children. I was all on board with her Chinese way of raising children, but I think she went overboard when it came to spending all the money she did to get her girls in with the most sought after music teachers. When it comes to money, I am realistic and frugal. I will and have spent more on my children's education than most people I know, but I'm not crazy. I know what kind of spending is ridiculous. She paid thousands of dollars, paying for one of the music teacher's and the teacher's boyfriend's travel expenses driving about 14 hours round trip, gas and hotel rooms, food, etc. to help her daughter prepare for an audition to study with a renown teacher. I'm all for getting my children the best I can, but within reason. That was my only problem with her method. I just would adapt it to my own temperament and that of my child's. I think that was the ultimate lesson that the author learned. That each child and parent is different. And that a little give doesn't make you too lenient of a parent. In my opinion the parents who are too lenient and settle thinking that everything is the teacher's fault that their children aren't achieving is the problem. She gave all she could to make her children the best they could be and at the same time showing them that they have what it takes to achieve at anything. Great read. It gives me proof that my children can be the best, and a little pushing won't scar them for life.ettle thinking that everything is the teacher's fault that their children aren't achieving is the problem.

These books grab my attention so much that I read all three books in one month.<br />And publicly, even thou... the type of sex is a hush hush topic.  Every Male and Female I ran into knew about this book.<br />Yes, the charatactors in the book are un-real and live in a fantasy world of perfection. In my opinion that's what makes these set of books the best.  The way the Ana makes her decisions and talks things out with herself....really made me feel normal.<br />The best writing / books since Sidney Sheldon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent reading! The book kept my interest and was not too long or detailed to where I got bored.<br /> Any book that hooks middle school kids on reading is amazing. I have discussed this book in detail with many students and they have the details down to an amazing level.

B00689J512|3.0|I was teetering on whether I should give this album a 3 or a 4. Nevermind the life that this popstar lives nowdays being in the news for all the chaos she causes herself. If I were 24 and a famous wealthy popstar I'd do the same.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this album is how her lifestyle seems to be affecting the work that she is producing. And if its not her lifestyle she needs to take a step-back and consider a career change. Like many of the reviews say, it seems rushed. Maybe it was a marketing tactic to put out Birthday Cake on her birthday, but why put a sampler on the album? COME ON!<br />I don't really know how often Rihanna writes her own lyrics, songs, or comes up with ideas to behind anything, but I do think that up until now she had a good team helping her create some pretty good music. Even though most of her songs on each album haven't made it onto the radio, I really liked the spunk and edge that she put into the final product. This album has some good tracks on it, but unlike other albums she has put out it feels like its all about sex. She seems to have this missions to find how many ways she can talk that talk (aka find the maximum amount of times she can tell you how good it is, how good she is, how she likes it.) This is all well and good (S&M favorite song from Loud), but she doesn't even try to mask it anymore. Shut Up and Drive was full of innudendo but no one needed to know. If anyone buys the Deluxe Edition and listens to Red Lipstick, you'll understand what I mean.<br /><br />Also, what happened to your accent that you had in Loud, Rihanna? Cheers and Man Down were so cool cuz your voice and accent blended so well together!<br /><br />Through it all though, I still managed to find most of the title track to be pretty good and We Found Love has her earlier pop-dance beginnings interlaced in there and the beats in most of the tracks are pretty good. I'm a big fan of Do Ya Thang, and Where Have You Been. This album also seems to cover a wide variety of genres, which makes me think that Rihanna is evolving and maybe this is just a step on the journey. I just hope that her next albums have more substance and are more thought out.a wide variety of genres, which makes me think that Rihanna is evolving and maybe this is just a step on the journey.

0385523394|4.0|I'm only about halfway through this prison memoir, but I find it quite interesting.  I doubt that Kerman's experience is typical, as she served a bit over a year in Federal women's minimum security prison, had good legal representation prior to prison, and had a loving family, fiancee, and friends who visited her frequently.  She was imprisoned, about 10 years after the fact,  for carrying drug money earned through heroin sales.  She admits to doing that. The Kafkaesque delay, between when she was indicted )which was several years after the crime occurred). for the crime and when she went to prison sounds most unpleasant. After the fear associated with entering prison, the experience appears to have been one mainly of constant low-level misery rather than a violent or completely intolerable environment.  Many of her fellow prisoners were imprisoned for similarly low level drug crimes, but lacking good legal representation ended up doing the long sentences required by the federal minimum sentencing guidelines.  The way to avoid these long sentences is to have a lawyer capable of making a plea bargain with the prosecutor; the judge can't do anything for you.<br /><br />The prisoners generally associated only with those of their own race.  Despite this, violence appears to have been uncommon, perhaps because the prisoners' gender. Yelling was common; hitting was not.  Prison work helped pass the time but was very poorly paid ($ 0.14 an hour base rate, up to about a $1 an hour if working Unicor), while phone calls and commissary items were expensive.  Kerman's financially comfortable family saved her from experiencing the worst.  Some things I would have thought would be provided to prisoners, such as bath soap, were not, yet oddly laundry soap was free.  Clothing was hand me downs from prisons for men, with a good deal of surreptious alterations going on to make them fit better.  It appears in general that the experience is tolerable after the initial shock wears off.Kerman has also been lucky to have good employment after the prison, a lucky break I doubt would be available to most of her fellow prisoners.
B000002LAB|1.0|...and it wasn't great when it came out either.<br /><br />This is perfectly acceptable music to drive your car to.<br /><br />Emerging from a long period lost to drug addiction and facing numerous physical difficulties, it is somewhat of a miracle that Davis returned to recording at this period of his life. And though synthesized to death, it sounds as if Davis has his chops back here!<br /><br />But. There isn't a lot to hear here. In a project where Miles abandons experimentation, abandons composition, abandons being the musical director, we get Davis jamming to some light funk grooves. The whole thing reeks of \\"studio.\\" With Davis' huge body of \\"electric\\" work -- about 25 years of problematic, interesting, funky, pithy, compelling music -- I'm not sure why anyone would choose to engage with this.<br /><br />P.S. I don't buy the explanation that \\"Miles didn't compose because he didn't like his contract with Warners.\\" I think Miles didn't compose at this time because he didn't want to compose. (Which is fine...the dude remains one of the most productive musicians of the 20th century!)
B00814NM02|5.0|I love this series and this movie continued to expand it and brought back Selene.  I am so happy that they seem to be preparing the series for the long haul. Great move bringing in younger actors to help keep the series alive and with a natural evolution.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next movie!<br /><br />On the SteelBook itself.  It could be better.  I gather the company that shipped it just bought them from Best Buy.  Somewhere along the line it obtained some minor imperfections.  Not pleased with this.  A SteelBook should be durable and I bought it because I am a collector, obviously I paid the extra money to have an awesome looking movie in my collection.  Very disappointed at the damage to the case.<br /><br />The manufacturer of the case should also be ashamed, or whoever selected the quality it was made at. This is the weakest quality of SteelBook I have ever bought.  There's no way to tell before you get it, but you assume a certain level of strength and weight to the steel when you invest the extra money.<br /><br />It's a cool case, but overall disappointed in the quality of the SteelBook itself.  I have bought collector's editions for other things that have much better quality, specifically the Collector's editions to both Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3.<br /><br />Will be wary of buying a SteelBook from Best Buy in the future (I know an Amazon vendor sold it, but it still had the Best Buy stickers on it overtop the plastic wrap, of which I am thankful because I knew it was an exclusive and didn't want to get a knockoff).
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This is a great film for adults and kids alike.  It's a re-telling of Jack and the Bean Stalk with a sword expert Kitty \\"Puss n' Boots\\" and his pal \\"Humty Dumpty\\". Kitty Southpaws turns out to be Puss n' Boots sweet heart.  It's a good chase movie that turns out to have a few life lessons in it.  After finding out he was in \\"Shrek\\", I'm going to have to buy all those movies to see more of this cool cat. I'm not much of fan of this genre.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|If you're already familiar with the Beatles' major hits, this will intrigue you.  If you don't already know the songs, it may be an odd collection of very different sounds and tempo and themes. But still good.<br /><br />George Martin and his son took the master tapes, and in some places took a collage of sounds to evoke memories, and in other places, blended songs with the same key signature or rhythm track to make very interesting transitions and combinations.<br /><br />In some instances, an additional refrain, a missing lyric or an acapella voice track makes you sit up and take notice of a classic song.  Sometimes, it's the full recording, not just the hit single. No matter what you know, it's compelling listening.  And definitely worth investing a few dollars into again.<br /><br />25 songs that criss-cross the entire Beatle catalog. You'll get a great feeling of nostalgia and especially significant is the choice for the ending piece, \\"All you need is Love\\"... married with a most interesting tounge in cheek goodbye ad lib from John Lennon... almost as if the fab four are giving you a final farewell salute.

The onboard memory stopped identifying it to the computer. No functions working.  Looked up SteelSeries on line and contacted them by E-mail. Had to send it in to them at my expense. They delayed for a week before approving the return and once they received it, they have delayed another week (and more)  by either not responding for days or by claiming that my mailing address (RR2 Box ### City,Mo)is not a valid shipping address (they cannot deliver to a PO Box). When I respond by informing them that it is in fact a rural route mail box used by U.S.P.S; UPS, and Fed-ex, they simply do not respond.  They offer no phone numbers, and the two guys I've e-mailed in Chicago (Mike S. and Brendan M.  NO LAST NAMES) have sent me back and forth to one another for some unknown reason. You may get the picture!<br /><br />While I enjoyed this wheel very much for just a short while, it seems to be flawed electronically. I bought it to bypass the mechanical failures associated with the more mechanical type wheels. I use it for fun, but also, to develope my coordination. While I did not look inside the device, my electrical engineering experience tells me that they may NOT have perfected this product to the point where it will last any longer than a month or so. Their methods of communication with customers gets a negative 5 stars. The wheel itself is a great idea that is not totally developed to the point of being reliable. 1 star for the wheel.<br /><br />So, it malfunctioned just days past the Amazon return policy deadline!

6304712499|2.0|A special effects marvel, `Spawn' is still an impressive feat in CGI even today.  The way that this film uses its strengths to propel this violent superhero epic is simply arresting.  I remember when Spawn was a popular superhero.  He was this bloody, demonic anti-hero who became the obsession of countless pre-teens who needed yet another way in which to show minor acts of rebellion.  We flocked to this film in droves (it was originally released in a PG-13 version) and then wet our pants when the director's cut was unleashed on us.<br /><br />This movie is all sorts of terrible.<br /><br />It is funny how things look in retrospect.  I have nothing but fond memories of this film, but watching it recently only brought frustration to my face.  Like I said, I'm still heavily impressed with some of the visual work.  For the time in which this was filmed, it is ridiculously impressive.  The makeup department also had a field day making this film a macabre delight.  Sadly, the buck stops there.  The film itself lacks so much depth, and this is sad when you consider the depth given within the comics to this character.  I'm not saying he's profound or anything, but there is a lot of work given to fleshing out his backstory in the largely successful comic book series (which is now somewhat forgotten) and so it is sad to see that sort of wasted on a poorly construction barrage of violence.<br /><br />I wonder what Christopher Nolan could have done with this?  Shouldn't he direct ALL superhero movies?  I mean, this could have been SOOOOOOOOOOOOO great and yet it just lays there, flat and flaccid and void of all real impact.<br /><br />Oh, and the cast is a semi-mess with Leguizamo failing to do what he thinks he's doing; be twisted and witty.

B004SIP9O2|3.0|What I disliked so much about this film was that it really rode the coattails of the original, without trying at all to be something grander or better.  Instead, it basically relished in the idea of being a carbon copy of sorts and so it became stagnant and predictable.  It has some memorable scenes (the attack against Campbell and Cox in the car was particularly intense and that opening massacre in the theater is somewhat epic when you think about it) but overall, `Scream 2' is a forgettable blip in the Slasher film catalog.<br /><br />The original `Scream' is such a breath of fresh air, even today, and I am one of the few who consider the third installment a step up from this needless sequel, but overall both pale when compared to their humble beginnings, and that is sad because there was so much to work with that could have resulted in exciting and fresh takes on the genre.  One of the things I really disliked here was the finale and the unveiling of the killer, which I found laughable at best and really preposterous.  They tried WAY TOO HARD to make it shocking and it came across foolish and really not scary in the slightest.  The cast as a whole is uniformly effective, with a few bad standouts (like Spelling and Olyphant in particular) and I found the romantic development surrounding Dewey and Gale to be a cheesy gimmick, but it did work in some scenes.<br /><br />The fun and life and humor that enveloped the original and helped make it fresh and exciting is missing in this `too serious' sequel that doesn't know how to make those balances.  The original was so smart because it was a borderline spoof on the genre that took potshots and made a mockery of murder in a way that hadn't been done yet.  It wasn't a comedy and yet you had a blast watching it.  This one tries to skew darker and so it loses that edge because it fades into the sea of other bloody slashers that don't possess the uniqueness that embodied 1996's surprise hit.<br /><br />I expected more than I got, which is sad, but it's still better than `I Know What You Did Last Summer'.got, which is sad, but it's still better than `I Know What You Did Last Summer'.
0446572993|4.0|Like other reviewers, I am glad to see this author make a comeback. I couldn't, however, give the book 5 stars. I was tempted to give it 3. Couldn't justify either.<br /><br />I have never read a book before where the reader and the protagonist knew so little of what was really going on, until the very, very end. That's my criticism. The first half of the book was so fast paced, I could hardly put it down. Then it began to bother me that there was so little information being given out. By the end, I was downright impatient and not in an entertained way. Whatever happened to clues? Great plot, though. Worth reading for the plot.
6305622914|5.0|`The Full Monty' is one of those films that remains enjoyable no matter how far removed you are from the date of its release.  The themes presented, the witty dialog and the overwhelming emotional feeling you get from the film's resounding finale will leave you wanting more (or at least to watch the film again).<br /><br />The film tells the story of a bunch of unemployed steel workers in England trying to make sense of their unemployment and put together a way to provide for themselves and their families.  Each man contends with his own drawbacks, insecurities and personal dilemmas, but they all come together in a way that highlights the loyalties of friendships.  When it is decided that they are going to put on a Chippendale's inspired strip-show things take off in unexpected directions.  Their decision challenges everyone involved, but not just in the physicality of it all (they are out of shape and unfamiliar with `technique') but also in the emotional, for it pushes them and their loved ones in uncomfortable positions.<br /><br />The great thing about `The Full Monty' is that is beautifully meshes both the comedic and the dramatic to create a fully fleshed out portrayal of real human bonds, struggles and triumphs.  The cast is hugely responsible for this, and they excel in beautiful ways.  Robert Carlyle carries the film rather well, giving it a hefty push with his dry wit and unexpected charm.  It is the supporting cast though, namely Tom Wilkinson and Mark Addy, who really make this film so special.  Their depth of conveyance is seen in every scene they embody, especially Addy who just creates such a moving and haunting portrayal of a man desperate to feel worthy of what he has.<br /><br />This is a smart comedy that we weren't expecting, but one that we embrace and cherish.  It has become a recognizable piece of cinema today, but sadly many only really consider this as a `comedy about male strippers' and it really is so much more than that.  Those who haven't seen this may snicker at the film's title and jeer at its premise, but this film has so much more heart than one would expect.<br /><br />So very worth it!t seen this may snicker at the film's title and jeer at its premise, but this film has so much more heart than one would expect.<br /><br />So very worth it!
B006TZBGBW|3.0|Despite the large amount of Metal I listen to, Judas Priest had been largely absent from my collection until only a year or so ago. I blame the mainstream media for doing a terrible job of selling me on them; rather than pushing the strength of the music itself, they pushed Priest's image--ya know, the mid-life crisis motorcycle fetish and black S&M leather, made all the more embarrassing how often it was emulated in light of Halford's homosexuality. Further, you can get a good deal of enjoyment out of Black Sabbath - Paranoid or Iron Maiden - Number of the Beast (i.e. the albums everyone and their mother tells you to check out), whereas British Steel and Screaming for Vengeance are really quite poor representations of Judas Priest's stellar discography. As such, Priest had always felt to me like KISS--that band your dad's generation seemed to idolize but you simply can't take seriously. A few sessions with Sad Wings of Destiny and Sin After Sin resolved that, and JP's enormous talent is now clear to me.<br /><br />As such, it came time to stop listening to downloaded albums and go about legitimizing my collection; I always knew I'd have to do it eventually, but figuring out which editions to buy and whether I would try to grab them all at once or spend years buying the odd album here and there when I had some spare cash is always a daunting experience. The announcement of a huge Judas Priest boxset, one containing every Halford album, retailing for $200 sounded intriguing. Particularly was the fact that the traditionally shunned first two albums would be receiving fresh Remasters for this collection, and that Sad Wings of Destiny would finally get a US release with the proper track order (sides A and B were famously flipped on the US vinyl, greatly damaging the flow of the album). On top of that, every album was to come in a mini-LP replica of the original vinyl editions (having had a few mini-LP's myself, I can vouch that well-done mini-LP's are truly a joy to possess). To boot, Amazon seemed to be selling this boxset at roughly half that price for those who preordered. That was enough to make me bite.<br /><br />Having finally arrived, and having had enough time to sit down with it and listen to a few of the albums, I can't help but feel this had the makings of an awesome collection, marred by cheap packaging and a general feeling of laziness on Sony's behalf.<br /><br />Firstly let me get the good down, lest I feel like I'm whining throughout the entire review. You are getting a huge amount of stuff in this box--17 albums, in fact. In one fell swoop, for a mere $105 (assuming you paid what I paid) you've grabbed every Halford-era Judas Priest album and nearly their entire discography. For the price, you're paying about $6 an album. That's not bad, considering they're new, and at least two of them are remastered. The remasters themselves sound fine, if nothing special. I compared Sad Wings (the only album I listened to all the way through) to a previous pressing of the album I had and didn't notice much of a difference--maybe a slight increase in clarity. If anything, I'm just happy the mastering was NOT compressed to hell and back for the sake of the loudness war. Purists will be glad to know that every album here is presented in its British editions--Rocka Rolla contains the original bottlecap cover (I preferred the Steel Tsar cover, but oh well) and Hell Bent for Leather is restored to its British title, \\"Killing Machine\\" on the spine. As best I can tell nearly all of these albums (i.e. anything that's not the first two or the last two) seem to be identical the Columbia remasters from 2001, containing the same bonus tracks. Given that they were already \\"remastered,\\" I guess it would have been a bit much to expect re-remasters specifically for this box. I think they sound fine, but be aware that you probably already have them.<br /><br />Where this box really falls apart is in its packaging. First, the box is clearly marked \\"The Complete Albums Collection,\\" which is an outright lie. Anyone who's looked at the package contents will immediately realize that the albums from the Ripper Owens years--Jugulator and Demolition--are missing. Aside from the fact that calling something \\"Complete\\" when it's not is deceptive, the omission of these two albums is all the more puzzling, given that economy or size was evidently not a concern when they decided to include no fewer than three live albums in the mix. \\"Unleashed in the East\\" has something of a reputation and its inclusion I can understand (particularly since it was so cleaned up in the studio that it might not even qualify as a true \\"live\\" album), but can anyone honestly tell me that they would rather have \\"Priest...Live!\\" and \\"A Touch of Evil: Live\\" in a box more than a complete studio discography? Halford loyalists be damned. Secondly, this box feels cheap. Really cheap. The box itself is a measly cardboard foldout that feels like it can't possibly be housing seventeen albums. Until you realize, that is, that the albums themselves are similarly housed in paper-thin \\"mini-LP replicas\\". Hard as they try to make those sound like a quality, collectible option, they are anything but--we would have honestly been better served by Digipaks. The cardboard sleeves do not open at all except for the right-hand slit, through which you will, agonizingly, try to pull your poor CD out. Let me be clear here when I say that these are NOT mini-LP replicas. Not the kind that garner such praise from music collectors. The mini-LP's you spend a pretty penny importing from Japan have a great deal of care put into them to ensure that they are exact scale replicas of the original vinyl pressings, from the size of the box to the inserts:  if the original vinyl package contained a poster, the mini-LP's contained an exact scale poster inside as well. As said before, those are a joy to own--these, by contrast, feel like the original vinyls were hastily scanned andcropped onto pieces of cardboard. They contain nothing other than the CD's themselves (which themselves abandon any notion of being true \\"replicas\\" by posting fresh copyright information on the CDs). The \\"booklet\\" included with the box is the bare minimum of what would qualify as an accessory. Within the booklet are a handful of photos, a brief forward, and a compilation of liner notes for each album (again, seemingly lifted directly from the 2001 remasters where applicable). They couldn't even get someone from the actual band to write some kind of retrospective? It's deplorable. There aren't even any lyrics included.<br /><br />What I'm ultimately left with is a collection that doesn't feel at all collectable. I was incredibly excited to buy this, but honestly, after ripping the two remasters and maybe one or two others to compare, this will probably just gather dust on myself. I see no reason to pull it out terribly often--why should I? To stare at the tiny cover art while I listen to the albums? There was very little love put into this product. Nothing you haven't seen before, and in fact if you owned every vinyl or CD pressing before you might find substantially LESS than you already had, considering the lack of lyrics. It makes me wonder who exactly this box was targeted at:  there is literally nothing to attract hardcore Judas Priest fans, given that they'll already have these albums sans the Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings remasters, and newcomers to JP probably aren't going to try to buy their entire discography at once. This box is neither as satisfying as a REAL Collector's Box (like Black Sabbath's excellent Black Box) nor owning each individual album in its own CD case where they can be proudly displayed on one's shelf. It instead feels like the \\"budget box\\" of various DVD collections, where if you don't feel like spending the bucks for lavish editions of some movie collection or TV series, you can instead spend $40 or so to get the entire show on a core set of ten DVDs stacked on top of each other on a spindle inside a barren box.<br /><br />While this will no doubt get much lower scores from Priest loyalists, I've given it something decent, because it served my purposes:  I wanted to \\"clean\\" my collection of Judas Priest downloads as cheaply as possible. And at $6 a pop, this did just that. But that's about all it did. Even the great value starts to come into question when you realize that the average Judas Priest album can be bought for $6-9 on Amazon anyway.<br /><br />I'm disappointed, but for what I paid I really can't complain. If you can get over the fact that there are absolutely no extras here, you're getting a collection of fantastic music for a very reasonable price, this is still a decent buy. Assuming you paid a very reasonable price, that is. The $200 retail seems absolutely ridiculous when I think about it, and really anything more than $130 or so feels like a waste unless you own no JP albums to begin with. Otherwise you're better off just waiting for the Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings remasters to be released individually (you know they will be) and fill in whatever holes you have yourself.
B000P5FH3K|3.0|A film like `The Rainmaker' doesn't really do anything that other films in this genre don't.  It isn't special and it certainly isn't a great movie.  I come from a bias viewpoint (not bias in a good way) since these legal courtroom thrillers don't often excite me past a performance or two.<br /><br />That said, `The Rainmaker' works better than it should thanks to the talent involved, both behind and in front of the camera.  Francis Ford Coppola is one of the greatest filmmakers of any time, and it has been sad to see his obvious fall from grace.  He is a conundrum of sorts when you consider the fact that he produces epic masterpieces like `Apocalypse Now' and then produces an airy romantic comedy like `Peggy Sue Got Married'.  Still, he has remained relevant until the aughts, where his star officially fell.  Even back in 1997, his take on `The Rainmaker' could be seen as a stroke of relevance since the courtroom genre, and John Grisham in general, was considered a hot commodity at the time.  While the clich&eacute;s and generalizations do abound here (Grisham has never been the most creative of writers), Coppola handles them like a pro and creates a film that stands up to all of its strengths in a respectable way.<br /><br />Calling the film respectable isn't necessarily calling it good, but respectable is better than embarrassing.  That respectability can also read as a tad drag or boring (is it too straightforward for its own good) but it can also be seen as a strength by some.<br /><br />The cast is also on point, which helps propel this film forward.  It carved out Damon's star persona, which was coming into full effect thanks to the same years offering of `Good Will Hunting'.  The supporting cast is even richer here, with a devilish John Voight, a scruffy and engaging Danny DeVito and a brilliant (yes, I said it) Claire Danes.  I wish it were a tad more fulfilling, plot wise.  I find it too familiar and too conventional, but that is the nature of the beast and thus why I never really took to the genre (someone needs to redefine this in a way that feels fresh and exciting).  Still, if you gravitate towards standard legal thrillers or find them engaging in their obvious regurgitation of one another, you can't really go wrong with this choice.<br /><br />It isn't as brazen or as thrilling as `The Firm' (one of the best in the genre, by a long shot) but it is uniformly correct, which has to account for something.thus why I never really took to the genre (someone needs to redefine this in a way that feels fresh and exciting).

B007SYWFRM|5.0|such a good game! ! play it all the time and I have really gotten far. level 18 already! you should go get it!
0783226888|4.0|I have not seen the 1973 original film, `The Day of the Jackal', despite the fact that it has been on my DVR for the better part of the past four years, so maybe that is why I can look back on `The Jackal' with the fondest of memories.  Besides, the 90's were a confusing time for me and my complete obsession with Bruce Willis only added to that confusion, and so I kind of salivated over anything I could get my hands on boasting his star power.<br /><br />This action thriller is labeled unrealistic by some and balked at for being farfetched in its construction, but some premises or genres or films in general are just made to be taken with a grain of salt, so I don't see how you can necessarily fault it for being what it is.  I know that sounds ridiculously hypocritical coming from someone like me, who has openly thrashed other films for not reaching for greatness or just being plain stupid in conception, but I said I was approaching this in bias (in not so many words) so forgive me that.  The acting is very well done, especially from Willis who is utterly chilling as the title character, and the pacing is extraordinary, giving you a true adrenaline rush of sorts.  Yes, there are a lot of plot points that seem placed there to elicit wide eyes and wonderment and not necessarily to make sense, but in the scope of the film it really doesn't matter much since the cast sells everything.<br /><br />So, if you are in the mood for an exciting thrill ride with a memorable villain, this is your ticket.  Just, don't expect it to be the smartest thriller you've ever seen.
B0086700CM|4.0|the game is full of twist and turns I have come up on some dead ends or turn or jumps RIGHT after I turn
B005DC68NI|5.0|I do not generally read this genre however thought I would give it a go when I found it for free on Amazon.  I absolutely loved this book and feel that anybody who is interested in publishing books, blogs or anything else on the net would find this an invaluable tool.  It has a great resource section at the back and the author easily engages the reader.  Lots of interesting information and raises issues one may not even think of.  If you are thinking of publishing or not, I would recommend as it gives a great insight into the digital world.

1416550550|1.0|This novel is a silly waste of time. Overly long, silly plot, very contrived, boring characterization.  You can spend your time better than this.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Out of all of the puzzle games I have played, The Lost City has by far the best graphics, most compelling story line, and good mix of puzzles and hidden objects.  I'm waiting to see what Fire Maple comes up with next.  Works excellent on Kindle Fire, and saved me on several long flights.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I am a Rush fan, but I don't give everything that they ever did 5 stars, although everything that they've ever done is at least above the bar of whatever the mainstream was at the time. They started their careers with a heavily Cream influenced debut, threw in some New Wave into MOVING PICTURES, SIGNALS and GRACE UNDER PRESSURE, some alternative in COUNTERPARTS... well, you get the picture. In every incarnation, they always managed to maintain a certain degree of integrity and virtuosity in their music.<br /><br />I am writing this review after two listens. I listened the second time with headphones while reading the lyrics and I felt the way that I felt when I listened to MOVING PICTURES and 2112 for the first time. I was drawn in and transfixed by the sound and the lyrical content. In this case, this album does not only rock, it soars! The band has been flirting with this sound since 1996's TEST FOR ECHO. As a matter of fact, the chromatic flourishes of Caravan are reminiscent of the ones used in that album's title track. The arpeggio in Wish Them Well is also similar to the one used in Carve Away The Stone, also from TEST FOR ECHO. There are other flourishes throughout that remind me of one song or another. Entre Nous made a cameo in there somewhere and Headlong Flight is an evolved version of something that would've fit well on FLY BY NIGHT. These are the calculations that I allude to with the title to this review. There is enough here that is familiar to draw in long-time fans that complain that their Rush don't sound like they used to, when in fact they've been revisiting their 70's sound on every album beginning with COUNTERPARTS!<br /><br />The allusions aren't so obvious that they are annoying, they merely add familiarity to the sound of this album. Here we have the band running on all 3 cylinders, (pardon the pun) or rather as a V-6! Since TEST FOR ECHO, Neil Peart has been writing from a much more cynical and mature point of view. The song Clockwork Angels is thematically similar to Freewill from PERMANENT WAVES, but where Freewill is written from a brash, in-your-face, rebellious stance, Clockwork Angels is written from an experienced, grown man's perspective. On this album Peart has distilled his ever more piercing views of society, religion and just life in general and married those views to his personal tragedies that he endured after losing his wife and daughter. You hear a lot of pain and anguish throughout the album and it is tempered with resolution and grace. Peart has never written more personally or honestly than on this album. This is by far their best realized concept album and Peart's best writing ever. The album has the same heavy sound and bleak soundscapes that were the centerpiece of the previous album, SNAKES AND ARROWS. There is, however, an added dimension of positivity and grandeur that was severely lacking in that album.<br /><br />After listening 7 times I changed my review from 4 to 5 stars and I placed Clockwork Angels as their third best album of all time. It is definitely the best concept piece they've ever done and the songs are so complex that I completely understand why this would take 5 years to produce. Listen to this and then listen to PERMANENT WAVES OR MOVING PICTURES. CLOCKWORK ANGELS gives them a run for their money. I only place CLOCKWORK ANGELS third place behind MOVING PICTURES and PERMANENT WAVES because those two are still more instantly accessible but CLOCKWORK ANGELS rocks harder and the lyrics are more amazing than anything they've ever done. Geddy's singing has improved and his range has a new fuller quality that I hadn't heard before. Neil is playing more in the background but with every bit of mastery that he can muster. Alex shines throughout. This album has the distinction of having the best ballad ever recorded by the band in The Garden. It is an epic ending to the concept of the album and closes things with a sort of magic that lingers. (Spirit of Radio anyone?) Ithink in time Rush fans will look back and agree that this is one of their top three albums.<br /><br />The story seems to be a metaphor for modern life. I picture the boy of the story as a model of Neil Peart growing up. The Watchmaker is God and the Clockwork Angels are the stars and planets, representing anything that humans have ever worshipped. The Anarchist is Peart himself rebelling at consumerism, blind faith and all the forces that pull us in different directions. As he matures he realizes how many mistakes he makes. The Halo Effect is about how we idealize things; in the case of the story, about how we idealize women. Carnies is about finding a life calling and pursuing it. Again alluding to Peart's own decision to pursue show business? Seven Cities of Gold is about how money rules a large part of our lives and how we are always chasing it. The Wreckers is about the people that start wars and ruin things instead of building things that matter. Headlong Flight is about the long journey that life is. Wish Them Well is about making amends with the people that make other's lives miserable instead of enriching them and their own in the process. The Garden is the brilliant conclusion that our hero, (Peart in disguise?) comes to when he realizes that:<br /><br />The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect<br />So hard to earn, so easily burned<br />In the fullness of time<br />A garden to nurture and protect<br /><br />In other words, success isn't measured by what you achieve in life, but rather by what people think of you while you live your life and what kind of garden you plant. So true,....<br /><br />I would highly recommend this album to anyone that loves art-rock, prog-rock, Rush and cerebral music. This might not be the best album to get to know Rush for the first time since it is a dense concept album and that might offset some people. I easily rank this in their top three albums and there is a lot to digest with repeated listens.<br /><br />My favorite Rush albums follow in order from best to least:<br /><br />MOVING PICTURES<br />PERMANENT WAVES<br />CLOCKWORK ANGELS<br />COUNTERPARTS<br />2112<br /><br />The rest of their albums vary greatly in both style and quality. They all have great moments but can all easily take 6th place. HOLD YOUR FIRE and PRESTO are probably the worst of the bunch and are best saved for last if you want to explore this great band. I would rank the rest of the albums as follows, but this list changes often with my mood:<br /><br />4 stars<br />GRACE UNDER PRESSURE<br />SIGNALS<br />ROLL THE BONES<br />TEST FOR ECHO<br />POWER WINDOWS<br /><br />3 1/2 stars<br />VAPOR TRAILS<br />A FAREWELL TO KINGS<br />HEMISPHERES<br />FLY BY NIGHT<br />CARESS OF STEEL<br />SNAKES AND ARROWS<br /><br />3 stars<br />RUSH<br />HOLD YOUR FIRE<br />PRESTO<br /><br />Happy hunting!
B004FOA84A|3.0|This is a fun mid-grade hidden object / puzzle game.  It's a bit simplified and shorter than others, such as Lost City, but still has decent graphics and a good storyline. Worth $1.99, but not much more.  Works well on Kindle Fire.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I use this app all of the time.  It is great for seeing an hour by hour precipitation chance or temperature, and it has a radar feature to see storm activity.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I just gave CA a first listen and I must say, I'm very impressed.  Although there's a lot to digest, there's a lot to immediately like on this album.  I'm already feeling like there are songs on here that are destined to be classics.  It's nice to hear Caravan and BU2B in their proper context and I like them much more now then I did at first, especially BU2B.  That one always had a hot and cold temperment with me and the newly recorded intro and subtle tweaks to the mix make it a solid song.<br /><br />Both die hard Rush fans and casual fans alike should appreciate this album.  There are snipets of their past sound, middle career sound, and current sound in there but also a look toward the future.  In essence it's Rush succeeding in being Rush by releasing something new and different.<br /><br />Ok.  Now that the warm and fuzzy stuff is over, here is what I am very disappointed in with this recording.  The mix.  Once again, we have a muddy clipped production.  Not unlistenable like Vapor Trails was but simply annoying.  In the 40 minutes during my drive to work today, I got out of the car and my ears were ringing from the noise.  This isn't the loud kind either.  There simply is no \\"breathing room\\" (if I can borrow another reviewer's comment) between instruments.  Neil's drums sound like he's banging on Quaker Oatmeal cans.  Alex and Ged's guitars are sometimes completely lost in the songs and several parts come across as just a wall of distortion.  Before you all jump on me about not being a true fan or accusing me of not listening to it on a quality sound system or whatnot, consider the rest of your music collection and how that sounds compare to more modern production.  There's no comparision at all. I made a comment in another reviewer's thread that 95% of my collection (dating back to the early 80's) sounds fantastic on everything I plug it into.  The remaining 5%, most of which was released in the past 15 years or so is just like this.  WTH? I just don't get it.  The only thing I can come up with is that they're now mixing it for the IPOD folks who are used to inarticulate  sound because they're just going to rip it into low quality low bit files, I dunno.<br /><br />Anyway, cheers to the boys for releasing such a great collection of songs. I hope they keep rocking forever.  Jeers to this day and age of sound mixing and poor quality production.  Can't wait to see 'em in Buffalo!<br /><br />UPDATE - Yep.  I just ripped it to my Blackberry and I'm listening to it with my earbuds.  It sounds fine with little to no complaining from me at this point if this is the format I want to listen; which, it isn't.  Trouble is, whether car stereo, home stereo, Bose Wave, still sounds like mud.  Grrr.<br /><br />UPDATE 2 - After about five listens straight through, I have to say that this is a fantastic album.  Every song has great hooks, and there is a lot going on in there (as usual).  The Garden is simply an amazing experience and hearing the prereleases in their proper context adds to them even more.  I have to say that this will be up there in my favorite Rush album category.  Not a single t urd on this release.  Great job, Rush!

B007PVHAN2|5.0|Growing up in Jamaica, you tend to hear a lot about \\"Bob\\" and you come to view him as a folk hero.  This documentary showcased Bob\\" the man and was an eye-opener.  Visits to the Bob Marley museum hint at a lot of what is revealed in the documentary but I think this film provides more of an understanding of the reasons behind the music.  I rented the movie and now I intend to buy it and I don't feel like I've wasted a penny.  Enough really cannot be said about how honest this film was and how authentic the people portrayed were.  I did chuckle a couple times when I saw Jamaicans being Jamaicans but I think this added to the honesty of the documentary.  I was not displeased and would recommend this to any Jamaican or Marley enthusiast.

B005KDWUFA|5.0|As always Il Divo is magnificent in all their songs.  Today I saw them in concert, and they sung all of the songs in this CD except Sempre Sempre.  It was a letdown for me since that was my favorite song in the CD.  My second favorite is Dov'e' L'Amore. Il Divo is one of the most inspiring groups ever.

B00006CXSS|5.0|We've watched this over the years and decided we needed to have our own copy. We got it faster than the anticipated date and immediately began viewing it; one or two episodes a day.<br /><br />I'm sure most of us have seen this miniseries. I enjoy it more than any other I've ever seen. I hate to see each episode end.<br /><br />The actual set (10 disks) I ordered is beautiful. An elegant metal box holds it all. It contains a lot of extras like insightful commentary by several of the actual men of Easy Company.<br /><br />I recommend this unreservedly.

B0059XTUVI|1.0|All those responsible for allowing Mrs. Thatcher to be portrayed in this manner should be ashamed of themselves.  This movie is a perfect example of how Historical License is greatly abused in the movie industry.  Know the factual history first before twisting it around!<br /><br />Mrs. Thatcher has been suffering from dementia for over 5 years, and yes, she is slowly slipping away.  However, during her entire time in office she was a force to be reckoned with.  Be it war with Argentina or going after the IRA in Northern Ireland, she stood by her convictions and never wavered.<br /><br />Using her present illness as a means of scattered reflection upon her earlier years filled me with disgust.  Total disgust!
B0058EZHYC|5.0|Being a UK Blu-ray, the concert is in 1080/50i which means that many US PS3s and TVs can't handle the reduced frame rate 50hz instead of 60hz. As for the extras not working, it's possible that those are in standard resolution and therefore in the PAL format.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Wonderful graphics. the games works very well. Super cute and fun to play. I didn't think it would be so fun

0985081821|5.0|It's been a little while since I found a book to win a 5 star rating out of me. And I usually only come and review the ones I thought were really, really good. So whaddya know? Here I am.<br /><br />The Forever Girl's main character, Sophia, wins you over quickly. She's a regular small town girl with a list of small town girl problems BUT, she's got her head on mostly straight. She's been \\"cursed\\" the last few years and has no idea why. Her mind is constantly filled with static and mixed voices that she has to physically and mentally work to keep tamped down while she goes about her life. She's been targeted by the local high and mighty bible thumper, who constantly points out the evil in her, like somehow she KNOWS. To top the cake, her own mother has sided with said bible thumper over the years and now views her own daughter in the same cruel light. (and this review is not to say there is actually anything wrong with bible thumping, I only use the expression to describe someone who is over the top in their beliefs and insists on pushing them on everyone around them.)Only, little does Sophia know, there are even more pressing problems out there waiting to take center stage.<br /><br />I liked this book a lot for several reasons that I'll try to outline...<br /><br />One...I like the concepts. It's a mix of old and new ones mixed together. Sure, we've mostly all ready about vampires and shape shifters and the like, but Hamilton brings forth some new \\"big bads\\" I hadn't heard of before. The plot revolves heavily around past lives exploration, which I know has been done before, but I enjoyed the unique twists that were thrown into the mix.<br /><br />Two...I really enjoyed the romance. There was no, \\"Oh I just met you and you're hot, so yeah, now we're together,\\" nonsense. Hamilton took the romance at a believable pace and I became really endeared to the survival of their relationship.<br /><br />Three....The character building and dialogue....I still feel like thereis more to learn about some characters, but there has been room left at the end of the book to expand. Overall, I felt like I got to know some of the characters very well, and their conversations were believable and well thought out.<br /><br />Four...There's room for more, but everything still wrapped up nice. I'm still dying to know what will happen next, but phase one of this conflict is complete in my opinion. I really hate that when I'm reading a series and it just.....ends. Like that. The end. All done.<br /><br />My one and only complaint, but completely not hindering of my 5 star rating...I wish Sophia wouldn't have kept her secrets for so long. I was twirling my hair while reading, then yanking on it, saying silently, \\"TELL HIM ALREADY!\\" BUT, I also understand that this is the nature of Sophia's character and all that she has been through and so it fits.<br /><br />All in all, I completely recommend this book. I would normally say something like, \\"If you like X, then you'll like this,\\" but since I haven't read anything like it, I'll just say it's pretty darn good! Just read it already!<br /><br />Thanks for taking my thoughts into consideration :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I hate stupid games. But I like this one. I play it all the time. So get it. I did!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This is just OK.  Is it worth the price? Probably not.  The front is very thin and will not stay folded at an angle if your moving around or kid is holding it.  Front flap also leaves a crease mark on the screen.  I'd pay a little more for a better quality case.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is cute as well as fun. Don't listen to the people who give this to their kid then forget to turn off the in game buying option. If you can wait a litter bit you can get everything without spending one penny.
1587613379|5.0|I picked up this book as a beginning to the exploration of multiple partner relationships and poly life living.  I have been interested in this lifestyle since high school and inspired by various books on the theme.  I felt capable of loving more than one person but knew I had to be mentally and emotionally centered to do that.  Twelve years later and my third book on poly lifestyles, I found this book.  At the time of the reading of this book I was in therapy and the lessons on owning your emotions, listening, communication, battling jealousy and other personal lessons were going hand in hand with my weekly sessions.  This book helped me work on myself and make more sense of issues and problems I was there to work on and it was amazing.  My therapist was happy I was reading this book in relation to my personal therapy and was very supportive.<br /><br />The exercises are wonderful for those like me who have vivid imagination and like to be active in their personal growth and healing.  I adore the active use of changing \\"bad\\" language and thought patterns and their being used as they should be.  I would recommend this book to anyone in any kind of relationship dynamic and/or who needs help with personal relationship issues.
B00003CXPD|5.0|It was a great movie with lots of dancing. I loved it! The actors were fabulous and the story line was very educational.  The subject matter was serious regarding the mining industry.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a very unexpected exciting book.  I could not wait to get the next book to see what happens next.
B004AQR24W|5.0|Okay, to be honest, I love, love this kind of action movie.  It is kinda kitsche and been done over and over.  But it had almost all of my favorite actors in it.  Sylvester stalone, Mickey Rourke, Jason Stratham, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, and Gov.Arlnold Swartzenager, just to mention a few  OMG don't let me forget Eric Roberts at his best.  Love them all.  Calmly waiting for Expendables II .....the Downloaded video works so well on my kindle fire.<br /><br />There will be others I am sure who will say this is boring...it is all in what you like.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Don't use it often but it sure is good to have it.  Much better than the first one I downloaded.
B0072X2O66|1.0|I am a pretty big fan of both Symphony X and Dream Theater.  I always thought DT would sound better if they had a singer who was more like SX.  So when I heard about Adrenaline Mob I was very hopeful that I would get my wish.  Unfortunately I really did not enjoy this album.  I bought it on release and I have given it several tries but I just can't get in to it.  The guitar tone is superb, the drums are amazing as is to be expected, but the overall package just fell flat with me.  I will admit I am holding these guys to the highest of standards because I know what they are all capable of.  These songs are pretty boring, typical arrangements, and overall not all that proggy.<br /><br />Sorry to say I can't recommend this one, but I highly recommend most Dream Theater and all Symphony X.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a fantastic game. It's awesome that this app is free. thanks for the free app and the other app u made like Angry Birds
B0083GQKQG|4.0|A deliciously creepy, \\"Bad Seed\\" film, often painful to watch--particularly if you are a parent.  In fact, if you happen to be down or in in a bad mood, I would keep away from this one.  It will only exacerbate your moodinesss. Artistically, the first several minutes of the movie are fragmented and obscure, which creates some draginess, but the film eventually gels and settles down.  The acting was very good and convincing on the part of all.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is probably my new favorite show. I am a fan of the books, and decided to check out the show a little late in the game because I don't have HBO. I was very pleased upon receiving the product because the case is very nice and in good condition. The discs themselves have nice special features and the set comes with an episode booklet. The show is really amazing, with quality acting and attractive visuals the entire time. I love the CGI opening theme that is a map of Westeros. I was especially pleased with the performance of the actor playing Tyrion, he really makes the series worth watching if nothing else appeals to you. If you are a book purist, a few changes may bother you. The only one that bothered me was the unnecessary addition of lots and LOTS of sex. While the book did have heavy mention of prostitutes, they absolutely run rampant in the show. I am not a prude or offended by sex, but at times I was just ready for the plot to move on to something that I cared about more, like the good action and intrigue. However, I understand that the sex is just part of the package with an HBO program. Overall, I would definitely recommend this show and this DVD set. I can't wait to watch season two.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|If you love Robert Downey Jr and a good, fast-paced mystery, you will enjoy this film.  Jude Law plays an excellent part as Dr Watson, as well.  I couldnt wait until it came out on video, so I could watch it again!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|FINALLY! Dude, this is the best thing ever! my parents kept goin on my kindle fire, and reading everything I put, but now I can lock it! yay! now I can rite bout how hot guys r without my parents reading it! specifically, one direction!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Nice simple straightforward calculator with a pleasant looking design.  it functions for what I need it for.  I would recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This was a very entertaining and challenging game with several levels to seek improvement. The ads did not overrun it and, for free, this was an excellent program.
B000093BDX|5.0|This is Obviously and,  therefore, Inevitably a Great Album-- For ALL of the already stated reasons and facts in the other 4 and 5 star Reviews!<br /><br />But like I implied in the Title of my Review, Everyone  neglected to state the Ultimate truth & The Obvious about this Album: IT should be in Amazon's Top 10!! Compared to all the other Trash & Rap,  listed  before this {and Leon Russell's \\"The Union\\"} as more Popular-- this album & \\"The Union\\"  should be #2 & #1 respectively!!
030758836X|2.0|Like others have commented, the ending was not satisfactory.  It's not just that it was not a \\"happy ever after\\" ending, but the last fourth of the book seemed to spin out of control with Flynn trying too hard to make it bizarre. I was going to recommend it to my friends, but now will not.  Too bad, I was loving it for awhile.
1401937519|5.0|This was the most amazing book I think I have ever read.  Of all the NDE experiences I've read about Anita's is the one that resonates the most with me.  Anita's journey taught her that not only was her Hindu religious teachings incorrect but so are the Western ideas of God as well.  I planned on loaning this book to my best friend and parents to read, however I can't part with it so I am buying them their own copy to read and keep.  Hopefully, they will be as moved by her testimony as I was.<br />Her awakening as she called it has help to set me free from being afraid of trying new things and worrying about what people will say about me.  Life is short and we should live it according to our hearts call not how other people think we should.<br /><br />Thank you Anita for writting this book! It has changed my life!
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I am a reading fan and love to read Paper Backs or Hard Covers when at home and electronic version, and even Audio Books when on Move. Recently I have tried to buy Kindle Version of Many books but for my surprise, Amazon, does not allow these books outside US.<br /><br />Recently I tried to buy the whole set of Games of Throne by G Martin, but faced the same problem. When Amazon will think about readers from outside USA (Britain and Middle East)?
B00785P2QC|3.0|its a good time killer lots to do you just run out of money a little to fast for me to give this five stars
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like the way it fits on my Kindle Fire's screen. Very clean layout and just the right amount of functionality for a weather app.
B003LXSY60|4.0|Love it! This album and band was new to me. I was turned on to it by my son, who is 32.  I'm an ol' blues fan from back in the day. The first time I heard it, I had to have it. Fresh and hard to beat. I listen to it over and over. My favorite is Ten Cent Pistol, but I like every cut. So easy to purchase with an Amazon account.
1905236042|5.0|As part of a residency project, I created a health curriculum for elementary school children and am currently putting it into action this summer.  I purchased these for my \\"Healthy Mind and Body\\" topic and found that it was engaging and fun for children of all ages (ranging from kinder to 3rd grade).  We were able to sit in a small \\"community circle\\" and meditate, work on breathing exercises, stretches and simple yoga poses.  The kids took turns pulling cards from the deck and reenacted the cards.  I would highly recommend it for P.E. coaches, babysitters, teachers, and parents with children of all ages (older children can play the \\"guru\\" and lead the younger children).  The cards are colorful and easy to understand.  An overall excellent product to keep children limber and engaged!
B0079XPUOW|2.0|John Scalzi works hard at being a writer.  Unfortunately, sometimes it shows.  This is regrettable because, ideally, he would always make it look easy.<br /><br />Redshirts is a fail.  I preordered it and paid what I consider an unreasonable price for an e-book (yes I know the publisher set the price -- doesn't matter -- I paid it).<br /><br />Redshirts has what ought to be kneeslapping fun premise. Unfortunately, it wasn't a comedy because, honestly, it wasn't funny. It also wasn't drama, romance, or even mystery (the big mystery or mysteries in the book are not solved or explained -- problems might be solved, mysteries no).<br /><br />I've seen (and, other than DS9, own) just about every Star Trek, TNG, and DS9 episode, all the movies, and read a bunch of the books and stories (you want funny Star Trek I suggest \\"[[ASIN:B000FC0PWQ How Much for Just the Planet? (Star Trek (Numbered Paperback))]]\\", it's a real hoot).  Although I don't really consider myself a \\"trekkie\\" or even \\"trekker\\" I've seen many of the actors in real life and even shared a Trip to Mars ride at the Huntsville Space Center with Gene Roddenberry (he looked pretty humorous at two or three gees with his then somewhat heavyset face rippling back towards his ears -- a shame I didn't have a camera).<br /><br />I can and do laugh at the stuff. One of my favorite movies of all time is .[[ASIN:B002MU4NL8 Galaxy Quest [Blu-ray]]] for crying out loud.<br /><br />Redshirts are especially funny (the tv show, Family Guy, certainly has fun with them).  Just the other month I was watching a classic ST episode with a friend when we realized Captain Kirk and Spock(?) were beaming down to a planet with like seven or eight redshirts.  It was a freaking army!  We looked at each other with big eyes and I said, \\"OMG, it's going to be a SLAUGHTER!\\"  And it was, of course.  They all died in ones and twos in about a thirty second window, just minutes after materializing and being sent out to die by their captain.  We fell out of our chairs we were laughing so hard.  People dying can be funny -- the game Paranoia was one of my favorites.  But, really, tons of scared people that know they are going to die horribly and have no idea why, only that something is toying with them?  In the immortal words of Jayne Cobb, \\"Where's that get fun?<br /><br />Redshirts the book just isn't funny -- and it should be, it really should be.

0345803493|2.0|I read the first book, I am not sure if I want to read the next book. Ana's character reminds of an over developed 16 year old, rather then a woman. Ana's personality seem very childish and imature to me. Not to mention the writer can NOT write. Anne Rice would have done a much better job of writing this story.  I am truly tired of hearing her \\"INNER GODDESS\\" line. It's just stupid. Which goes along with maturity level of her character.
B0086700CM|5.0|WOW. I love this game love this game so so so so much!!!! I even found my dad playing it in the garage! LOL!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this app because it has over a hundred different. games on it to play and yet you also have the challenge of unlocking the games. I enjoy it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|FINALLY!  Sci-Fi as it was in the beginning and now is again!  Where to start... Background - I pretty much picked this collection on a whim, on my Kindle, in the middle of the night after finishing...you get the picture.  So incredibly glad I did.  Details first - excellent character development, world building (as enclosed as it seems - VERY real and \\"there\\" for me), and outstanding evolution-transformation from a single novel effort which expanded to a 5-part epic.  Next, \\"issues\\" - as many of you know, one of the all time greats, Ray Bradbury, recently passed on to the next great adventure.  I believe he would have thoroughly enjoyed this series as I did.  Why?  Hugh Howey takes on the serious issues of our time, sets the scene 300 years in the future (give or take) and literally strips it all naked for our entertainment and contemplation - as Bradbury did in his time with novels like Fahrenheit 451 and Martian Chronicles back in the early 50's.  YES, I just compared Hugh to Ray.  Mr. Howey, thank you for your wisdom, world and talent.  Looking forward to reading much more of your work.  If ever in DC, dinner on me.  Would be honored to meet you.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|We bought this as one of our 9 year old daughters main Christmas presents and it has been a huge hit. We enjoy Monopoly in the first place, just for some friendly competition, and having our daughter work on her math/money skills by forcing her to be the banker.<br /><br />Add in that it's Nintendo and we couldn't have been happier. Though it makes it completely predictable what the kids are going to do, as they will fight over who gets the Zelda properties despite good strategy! ;)<br /><br />The pieces are solid, no chipping or denting. A couple of them aren't great about staying upright, but I remember the same issue with the dog in the original, so nothing to really complain about there.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very good version of solitaire with options for Vegas or regular scoring.  Three card or single card draw options are nice as well as the cumulative or single game Vegas style scoring.  Better than the Microsoft versions on windows whatever.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Full disclosure: I'm a big fan of Scalzi's, having discovered Old Man's War last year, and have read everything else he's written. I particularly LOVE his short stories (hunt them down and buy them, they are fantastic).<br /><br />I don't do synopsis reviews, look elsewhere for that. I try to write without spoilers, so if I am vague, I apologize. I liked this book at lot, although it's not my favorite Scalzi. The premise was a lot of fun. The set-up was great, and while it had familiar elements with the whole \\"meta\\" theme, it was made fresh by Scalzi's distinctive voice. That said, while it was fresh, I felt that the narrative in the second half of the book was a little weaker, as it had a some troble sustaining itself. This book may have been better served in short story, or a least novella, form? At any rate, there is no reason or science behind the \\"twist\\" in the narrative. While I'm not one who demands that everything be spelled out by science or pseudoscience, or even fantasy, I wasn't quite sure what the point was, other than as sort of a love letter to a)Star Trek b)the guys who toil in the background writing sci-fi TV shows (Hmmm...both a type of red shirt, perhaps???). The \\"twist\\" is just a plot device, I guess.<br /><br />I thought the 3 Codas (yes, the title is accurate) helped finish the book in a stronger position, at least from a narrative perspective. It did seem like he had trouble writing an ending, but then came up with this. Or, perhaps he came up with the Coda-design first, and then filled in the main narrative as the background. I liked the form, whichever the order!<br /><br />In close- 4 stars, certainly worth a purchase if you are a Scalzi fan. Enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this works great now we need free cell works good not many ads great pass time and its free thanks
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I love these guys.  Always have, but honestly, the Rush that I have known is now just a bluesy Jam band now.  Where is the clever arrangement?  Where is the shock value of a well written riff by Alex?  Where is the vocal counterpoint that goes beyond the foundation melody here.<br /><br />Rush could do these things before, and perhaps it is the fault of the producer.  The producer who seemed to make it happen was Terry Brown.  Since then I don't think other Rush Albums have been as good.  I have tried to let Clockwork Angels grow on me, but it still feels like they are hovering over the same bluesy Jam band thing.  Neil is just jamming.  There are not many well calculated RUSH moments on this.  Geddy stays in the comfort zone with singing melodies.....I just don't feel it ......They continued to be a great live band, but they need someone to bring back the freshness.  This producer should be at fault.<br /><br />Sorry to be so critical, but I hold Rush up higher than most bands.  This collection of tunes just is not good enough for one of my fav bands.<br /><br />6/27 update:  To my surprise the music is growing on me.  I am really enjoying Caravan now.  I am giving it more time.  I am doing this because again I think Rush deserves many listens.....
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game but I think they should update and put more characters and could do more with it. It is really fun though!!!
0062197258|5.0|This book is one of the best mystery novels I've read in a long time. It is also one of the scariest! The book is so well done it is hard to believe it is Miss Haynes first novel. I look forward to more of her writing.

B005LAIGRS|3.0|Positives:<br />Contemporaneous and somewhat well researched story of US covert/secret activities in the name of the usual \\"protecting US interests\\" (are they ever defined?) operations overseas and here.<br />Good location filming: South Africa; Paris; D.C.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />(1.) Predictable, at times, robotic acting by all including our two leads.<br />(2.) Seen before storyline of ex-agent now rogue and being a pain-in-the-butt to his former CIA (or whatever agency) bosses. A bad CIA person as usual.<br />(3.) Usual implausible unlimited bullets; body counts; and overdone, so unrealistic it's laughable, car chase scenes.<br />(4.) Usual Eastern European and Arab or Palestinian bad guys suggested. Good guys, of course is the Israeli Mossad. I wonder if Hollywood producers will forsake the money and show their illegal, if not immoral, activities?
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I found the movie good except for the last five minutes. I read the book and I felt that it should've ended after the credits. Other then that it is a must-see

B007UXTG8M|4.0|Shame is one of the better films I have seen over the past year. There is a very impressive tracking shot which follows Michael Fassbender running through the city, and I was wondering how much time and effort it took to get that done (probably a lot of time, money and patience). Much of the film is shot at night, which is a nice touch, considering how expensive and time consuming it is to do that, as well as considering it fits with the general dark theme of the film.<br /><br />Overall, I liked Shame because it accomplishes something few films do; it manages to be entertaining and meaningful at the same time. Most films only accomplish one of those.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I am building a pc for myself and a friend of mine. I bought 2 of the same board from two different companies, Amazon and Tigerdirect. Mine was from Tigerdirect and I had problems from the start. I had random boot errors. Bios check sum error that would go into a loop with the bios being backed up, a blue screen of death, and it would just lose power. Though I believe the power and BSoD wasn't the motherboards fault, but the Bios error was. The one I bought from amazon ran great from the start. No errors or anything.... yet. This is the first time buying pc parts from amazon and so far so good. I suppose its random if you get a faulty part from time to time.

1594203334|1.0|I have to admit, I read this book following all the positive reviews, but I was left feeling very disappointed. Perhaps as I am raising children in Europe myself, I didn't quite get the appeal of the story or what which discoveries were so new and exciting (or, for that matter, \\"controversial\\", as some reviewers have put it). I felt it was neither written well, nor were there any \\"discoveries\\" one hasn't already heard about a million times. The book had potential, but it was so repetitive and, at times, read like a term paper, that I couldn't wait to finish it (and that's not meant in the positive sense). The author never really seemed to find a voice and couldn't decide if she wanted to focus on anecdotal stories or prove her points by citing endless studies.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|wow, this is an amazing office application! it isnperfect for using things like dropbox, as it saves files directly in Microsoft Office format. definately get this app: it is only 99&cent; and definately worth it!
B0071K5KWU|5.0|Okay, I admit I've been a huge Banks fan for some 35 years. His music with Genesis I always found very moving and easy to relate to. But the side of his music I always loved the most was the beautiful, detailed instrumental side, and that is what we get here. Now I liked 'Seven', but 'Six' is a marked improvement. Every piece is lush and emotional, often complex, but at the same time, often pastoral, recalling Vaughan-Williams, and perhaps even more reminiscient of Delius' Brigg Fair. But most of all it sounds like Tony Banks, his signature chord stylings are present and work beautifully in this orchestral setting where his exotic chords are well utilized, something somewhat missing on 'Seven'. It's hard to pick a favorite piece, but certainly 'The Blade' is stunning-not in a technical sense, but emotionally. If this doesn't bring tears to your eyes, I'm not sure if anything will-it's that good! This has become a very personal cd for me, and, odd as it may sound, is probably the most 'perfect' cd I've ever heard.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is wonderful!  I am constantly checking to see what goals I can beat to make my village the best it can be.

Also when I'm trying to turn it doesn't sense my finger pressure and keeps going straight and I die... Anyone else have this problem?<br /><br />Overall I think this is a great app and I recommend this to everyone!

1612130283|1.0|I can no longer live in a reality where Fifty Shades of Grey is considered, by some, the greatest romance novel they have ever read. I can't even live in a reality where a few people say it was an okay book.<br /><br />Goodbye cruel world.<br /><br />I never expected it to be this terrible. I never even thought it possible for a book this terrible to get published. But here it is, so we may as well warm up with a few quotes:<br /><br />\\"Anticipation runs bubbling like soda through my veins.\\"<br /><br />\\"My scalp prickles at the idea that maybe, just maybe, he might like me. After all, he did say he was glad Kate didn't do the interview. I hug myself with quiet glee, rocking from side to side, entertaining the possibility that he might like me for one brief moment.\\"<br /><br />\\"Grey smiles a dazzling, unguarded, natural, all-teeth-showing, glorious smile.\\"<br /><br />I think you get the point. Now let me delve a little further into why the writing made me want to vomit all over the inside of Charlie Tango:<br /><br />Extreme overuse of certain phrases: Oh my, I blush, I flush, holy crap, holy cow, crap, double crap, crapola, my breath hitches, his breath hitches, his eyes were hooded, and endless references to \\"down there.\\" Down where? Oh, down *there*. Cue the sound of a creaky old door opening and bats flying out. But seriously, one of these phrases shows up on every single page.  Also, in the middle of Ana using words like \\"crapola\\" and \\"jeez,\\" we suddenly see words that nobody ever heard of like \\"avuncular\\" and  \\"mercurial.\\"<br /><br />EL James has no idea that there's a difference between a subconscious and a conscience. Ana is constantly fighting with her \\"subconscious,\\" who is some sort of mix between a prudish librarian and a Ricki Lake audience member (\\"You a ho!\\"). She's that little voice that is always telling Ana what she's doing is wrong. You know, YOUR CONSCIENCE. You subconscious is just what it sounds like - below consciousness. You don't know it's there, and you definitely don't converse with it - unless maybe your name is Sybil.<br /><br />Now let's take a look at Anastasia Steele:<br /><br />1. She becomes mentally challenged the second Mister sculptured lips hangy-pants so much as hands her the remote control. At one point she actually asks, in all seriousness, if it's \\"legal to look that good?\\" She loses all ability to speak, think, walk, and use her medulla oblongata (don't look at me, Ana mentions it several times)at the mere sight of the man. Even Bella Swan had more wits about her when Edward was just hanging out eating a sandwich.<br /><br />I think that most of this relates to the fact that she has zero self-esteem. She thinks she's unattractive, klutzy, and worst of all - she's a brunette! Everyone knows brunettes are hideous!<br /><br />2. She doesn't care that Christian is controlling and abusive because he's just so darn hot. Her self-esteem is so low that she literally says she would do anything to be with him. \\"Anything\\" includes allowing herself to be whipped, spanked, and stalked across the country, even though he scares the life out of her. She says that she's in love with a man who she can't even make a joke around without being terrified that he's going to get angry and spank her.<br /><br />All of these things, and more, made Ana a weak, pathetic, joke of a character.<br /><br />Now let's take a look at Christian Grey:<br /><br />I don't care how hot he is, or how much money he has, the man has absolutely nothing to offer. Between his lack of personality, his lack of a sense of humor, and his general desire to beat women into submission as some sick form of \\"caring\\" for them, he is nothing but a disgusting self-centered pig. Oh he was abused as a child? He didn't get enough love? Fine, that's a perfectly reasonable explanation for him turning out the way he did, but it's no excuse for what he's doing to Ana. If two adults are both into that lifestyle and legitimately want to participate, then okay fine. Maybe that's how real BDSM relationships work, I don't know. What I do know is that's not the case with this book. Christian Grey is a manipulator, who takes a girl with no experience, no self-esteem, and no mind of her own, and convinces her to do things she's not comfortable with in order to \\"please him.\\" He wants to hurt her. He's stated it several times.<br /><br />And to top it all off, Ana is just giddy with joy over the idea that someone like him could actually like her. The idea that a man who is controlling, threatening, physically violent, and doesn't allow you the time or space to have your own life and thoughts, is actually romantic, is a seriously disturbing trend.<br /><br />And so I conclude, so I may get on with my life...<br /><br />As a self-published author myself, I am not sure I would want to make my millions off of a book like this. I'm not the type to sucker people out of their money and then laugh all the way to the bank. Oh I would still go to the bank, for sure. Most of us dream of being rich. But I would go to the bank with my head down. I would go to the bank with a promise in my mind to one day make up for perpetuating this twisted and dangerous version of love. I'd send a damn lot of my money to charity.<br /><br />That would almost be fifty shades of decent. But I won't hold my breath.hen okay fine.

When I fell the tote hit the ground hard.<br />When I finally check on my Kindle Fire, I was very happy to see there was no damage to the<br />screen or other fragile parts of the device. I would recommend this to anyone that<br />owns a Kindle fire. I may purchase another to give to my niece to keep her Kindle Fire<br />safe.
1612130283|1.0|Dr. Oz devoted a show recently to \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" which he called the \\"The Cure for Your Libido.\\"  Laura Berman, a gynecologist, and a psychologist all praised the novel as helpful for women bored about sex or sexless in their long-term relationships. I understood them to say that Fifty Shades helps such women have more sex and more rewarding sex with their partners, a laudable goal.  But why?  They said Fifty Shades provides desire fantasies for an intense focus on the sensations of sex because, in the novel, the woman was restrained physically and could only participate in partnered sex receptively.    BDSM is a topic about which I knew virtually nothing.  But it was easy to find research.  A large survey in Australia reported in 2008 [...] that, in the 2.2% of males and 1.3% of females who engaged in bondage and discipline sadomasochism, \\"they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity, and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious-indeed, men who had engaged in BDSM scored significantly lower on a scale of psychological distress than other men. Engagement in BDSM was not significantly related to any sexual difficulties.\\"  Their \\"findings support the idea that BDSM is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority, and for most participants not a pathological symptom of past abuse or difficulty with \\"normal\\" sex.\\"    On the other hand, the novel is about a college senior about 21 years old and a virgin to all sexual activity, even masturbation, who is about to graduate from a public west-coast university (a plausibility-ripper even for a bodice-ripper, but these novels are about fantasy, not reality).  She falls in love and lust with a preternaturally handsome and fabulously wealthy 27-year-old high-tech CEO, the eponymous Mr. Grey. Inside his wit, savoir faire, taste, and skills as a pianist, pilot, and sexual coach, he's a mess. He cannot accept any touch, let alone sexual.  He cannot discuss his feelings, especially about the cigarette burn scars all over his chest, about his crack-addict sex worker mother, or about the older married woman who took his virginity when he was 15 and conditioned him to need BDSM in order to be sexual.  But he is expert enough about how to treat women, after an admitted 15 relationships with submissives, that he induces hypersexuality in Steele by extreme application of conventional, safe, non-painful, even tender methods of inducing arousal and orgasm--\\"vanilla sex,\\" as he calls it.    Her soargasms and roargasms beget s'morgasms: she achieves progressively more intense orgasms, always upon his command, never without his approval, and, because his Big O immediately follows hers, gratifying her (see prior parenthetical phrase).  Then he rather systematically teaches her to associate increasing pain with sexual pleasure.  Though she comes to fear and hate this, she thought-bargains with herself that if she accepts the pain he doles out, she will gain leverage to make him tell his painful history, get over it, and give her the \\"more\\" that she wants: more true intimacy, more openness to accept her as an equal, and especially to accept her affectionate and sexual touch.  [you decide: is there any danger that this kind of thinking will put sex therapists out of business?]    Let's label this for what it is: codependency, the compulsive mode of egoic thought that seeks to manipulate other people into doing our will, loving us, and not abandoning us, instead of accepting that other people are what they are, that they are not subject to us, and that loving action, not manipulation, may (but may not) gain a return of love.    Nothing seems amiss in the novel's thesis that a woman can get sucked into being sexually abused by a man who provides high rewards and intermittent punishments.  Jim Pfaus, reviewing sexual conditioning, concluded that \\"it is each animal's unique experience with sexual behavior and sexual reward that molds the strength of responses made toward sexual incentives.\\"  [...]    And, isn't it possible that either or both of these factors (conditioning and codependency) may underpin why many women stay in abusive relationships--that there are rewards to be gotten despite the injuries?    But let's get back to the first question: why is Fifty Shades good for women?  Why are millions of women turned on by this book instead of turned off?  Student Ana Steele raises objections to Grey eventually and maintains some independence of will, even walks out on him in the end after an unmitigated beating, so is it as anti-feminist as I have portrayed?    Well, I don't think you can take what happens on the final page of a 514-page novel, one with an explicit sexual episode every thirty pages or so, as the lesson.  I think the lessons get inculcated throughout the book:  * hang in a relationship though he's mysterious because you'll eventually crack his mystery;  * hang in if the sex is great because it's more powerful than your willpower;  * hang in though he overwhelms you emotionally by alternating between brooding, anger, and indulgent humor because you fear his leaving will rob you of this emotional drug cocktail/roller-coaster;  * hang in because he is really motivated by love deep down rather than by his observable possessiveness and mental illness.    And hang in with reading Fifty Shades if you don't think we already have enough sexual, physical, and psychological abuse of women.  Hang in if you think overwhelming, romantic sex is better than an intimate relationship.  Hang in if you think women belong in the boudoir, not the boardroom. But I'm not going to buy the rest of the Grey trilogy.
B0086700CM|4.0|the game is a great time waster, the motion is pretty fluid and for the most part the controls work well. I was informed that there was and update but upon installing the game it told me I needed to remove the old version which resulted in the loss of all my achievements and unlocked content, this is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely CANT get enough of this game!!! It definitely helps me unwind after a long day at work...or to bring a smile to my face, on a rainy day...Great job, Gameloft!!!
B008764ZQ4|4.0|everyone should own these songs.  The originals are better, but these are *almost* as good!  Imho, the lead girl's voice is annoying, but all of tom cruise's tracks are fantastic, plus \\"I wanna rock\\" is awesome.  Btw, please don't let your teens see this movie.  The PG13 rating is absurd.  There is SO much sexuality on the screen.  :-(  Just buy them the soundtrack, because they should still hear the great music.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Wow... I mean... Wow. What a steaming pile of something I'd rather not step in. I want my money back. Seriously. I enjoy well-written erotica, and I enjoy a good trashy read from time to time. I'd heard that it was \\"soft-core mommy porn\\", so I didn't expect it to be Lady Chatterly's Lover or even Anne Rice at her steamy best. I thought it might be a fun way to kick off beach reading season. It couldn't be any worse than Twilight if the sex is sexy and fun. This book is a several notches below Twilight in it's quality. Picture badly written Twilight fan fic (which I've heard it is, in fact), with a dumb ass college student who's looking for the Heathcliff to her Katherine yet can barely read the back of a serial box, in fantasy Pacific Northwest setting, with mind-numblingly dull and repetitive language, sub/dom sex-scenes, and a freaking male Mary-Sue billionaire who has a tortured past. But it's different with her! Her wants to make love to her! Ugh... It could be good, but it's not. No wonder the author used a pseudonym... Who'd lay claim to a book with cheesy soap-opera character names like Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey? I can't finish the thing... I keep laying my kindle down in annoyance at the utter silliness of the whole scenario. It would be more tolerable if there were vampires... There'd be some hope that all of these cardboard characters with dialog out of a sixth-grader's diary would be eaten. But alas, there is no Edward or Bella here... Just two miserable idiots having unsexy-sex. Bored now. I want a refund. I'm going to have to read some Anne Rice to quell my need for something much more titillating. The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, here I come!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am intrigued by Christian - the complexity of his character was one of the reasons that led me to purchase the next book.<br /><br />For all the people criticizing the book - what did you expect from erotic fiction?  War and Peace?
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I ordered this knowing that there are more negative reviews than positive when you search Amazon and the web in general.<br /><br />I used the YouTube method of using boiling water at a slow stream over the crack/scratch this cutter makes.<br /><br />Out of ten bottles, only one was usable.  Another was salvageable but only after a large amount of polishing work.<br /><br />If you have access to a wet saw designed for use in cutting glass, rent it or use it before relying on this \\"bottle cutter\\".<br /><br />If you want to rely upon this product, this is how you may be able to get slightly better results.<br /><br />The instructions state to only make one pass with the cutter on the glass.  If you do this, your failure rate will be 75% or better.<br /><br />Make at least three very slow and very aggressive passes with this bottle cutter and use the slow-drip boiling water/cold water method outlined on YouTube.  This has resulted in a more than 70% success rate depending on the type of bottle.<br /><br />I am still trying out alternate techniques to improve efficiency in the end product and if I can find a better method, I will gladly post it here.<br /><br />I would humbly ask that anyone else discovering such a technique to do the same.

B002BWP49C|5.0|One of my favorites of the Twilight Series. I very much enjoyed it (although I enjoyed all of them). If you are a Twilight fan you will enjoy this DVD. I don't nit pick movies. I thought they did a great job with the movie considering all the details of the wonderful book series. And each movie  from this series gets better and better.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|anyone who says they whatever this game is obviously smoking crack! they don't know WTH there talking about. I mean come on this game is freaking awesome! so yeah you idiots can shut the *blank* up!:)

B0080SZ0V8|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. some of the puzzles are pretty challenging but easy to get lost in it. great value.
0385344228|5.0|This is a well written book.  I was hooked as soon as I started it and it has a very suprising ending!
034580404X|1.0|For an \\"erotic\\" novel, Fifty Shades of Grey and the rest of the trilogy is boring and repetitious. I read the first book, started the second and it was the same thing over and over and over again.  Skipped to the end of Fifty Shades Freed just to see how she managed to end the relationship between the two most boring people in the world.
0307352145|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It described a lot of research that the author had done in a very reader-friendly way.  As I read I thought of the various people in my life and the students whom I teach and was amazed at how they sometimes fit directly into the \\"introvert\\" category or how others were \\"pseudo extroverts\\" and so on.<br /><br />What I really appreciated about the book was that they author wasn't trying to prove whether being an introvert or an extrovert was better, but how the different characteristics of both are valuable to our society.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\" gave me a lot to think about as I look at the students in my classroom and what may or may not make them comfortable and situations in which they may flourish.  It stressed the importance of appreciating all opinions and sometimes waiting for the louder opinions to die down so that the quieter opinions and ideas can come forth.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Depending on who you play this game with, it will keep you laughing. When I first started playing, I thought that I was a pretty good artist... not anymore. :-)
0345803507|2.0|I read the 1st and much of the 3rd book of this Trilogy.  I did not think I could make it through the second book, but did want to know the ending.<br /><br />I found the books to be slow reading and cannot believe any of them made it on the New York Times Best Seller List.  The only reason I did not toss the first book down after the first few chapters is because the books are expensive, so I felt compelled to keep reading after spending that much money.<br /><br />There is little action in the book.  It is mainly lovemaking,which is often the same over and over and over.  It gets very boring.  I don't know why people on the talk shows talk about how kinky it is.  It has little to little to do with S & M, just a messed up domineering man.<br /><br />All 3 books could have easily been condensed into 10 pages.<br /><br />I would not recommend wasting your money on any of these books.  I wish I hadn't bought into all the hype about it.
0345803485|2.0|I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I really wish this book had 3 stars by it to be fair to all. I was drawn to the book like many others because I heard it was sooo \\"hot\\" just like Mr. Grey...But it really is not. The first few sex scenes are kind of interesting because it does touch on a sexual world that many don't know about; however, this book is still based on Twilight characters, which is its ultimate downfall. (I did not know that when I originally started reading). So, Yes there is a blank, no personality girl who pulls the hottest AND the richest man in town (and most well-rounded man on planet earth). Yes the writing is horrible, and the repetitive phrases are extremely annoying. I struggled getting through the first book, but I really just wanted to see what happened. You start skipping the 100-orgasms in one sex scenes just to finish.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are going to read this book, let it be pure entertainment at best and do not try to read into anything, as the writer even believes she's not that great of a writer. This is definitely not book club worthy.<br /><br />Pros: You get to think about sex and new things to do with it. It may stir up old feelings of lust in your relationship.<br /><br />Cons: The book can really get annoying and unrealistic (not just unrealistic because he's rich). I hate hearing that teens are buying into it deeply.<br /><br />Warnings: You will probably roll your eyes as much as the characters do and have an attitude because you feel stuck reading it just to see how it ends...only to learn it really doesn't end.
1594135851|3.0|I loved the book; however, several of the pages were completely loose and would fall out of the book or completely missing.  The book was supposed to be new; but, I would not be able to resale it even though I have taken excellent care of it.<br /><br />Love all of the 3 books in the Trilogy!
1936608898|5.0|I've been reading and trying to eat primal/paleo for about 2 months now.  I've read most of the highly recommended books on the subject and have enjoyed them all.  This book, however, explains simply and perfectly how I can eat to save my life, to extend my life, and how to have a happier and more fun life.  I am so fired up and so grateful this book arrived at my mailbox just yesterday.  I stayed up reading last night and went to bed feeling like I've been blessed to receive it.

B0013F1D02|5.0|I've never been a big fan of fantasy movies, but this one is really good. It's a fun and enjoyable movie with a good story. A movie for all ages.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really enjoyed reading 50 Shades even though the writing is clearly in need of help. The characters are engaging and the storyline keeps you wanting more but at times I wanted to roll my eyes over the poor writing.<br />After reading the book I looked up the author and learned this was her first novel and I then understood why the book sounded so poorly written. Overall though I recommend the book, just be warned the writing gets more and more tedious and the third book was actually painful to get through...but that's another review.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|ThIs could definitely be hard for some to read, as it gets very racy and kind of disturbing, but still a fun and exciting read! I'm glad a coworker turned me on to it!!
0345803485|5.0|I learned about this book from a co-worker who read an article about it in an entertainment magazine...so I downloaded the free sample and was thoroughly engaged-so I bought the full book and could not put it down. It was a great read from cover to cover! It is definitely captivating and exciting. Kudos to EL James. I will read it again!!

B005LAIHSQ|2.0|I remember seeing some critic's quote in a tv spot for Snow White and the Huntsman calling it a Masterpiece well clearly that's nonsense because Snow White and the Huntsman was a very mixed bag of a film..the first hour of it was bland and unengaging but When the dwarfs and the fairy forest came into the picture it became a little less bland and somewhat tolerable..Bob Hoskins was excellent as the blind elder dwarf and their is a sequence where this beautiful Irish folk song plays while the Dwarfs and Snow white are walking grieving over the loss of one of their own...The last ten minutes of the film had a few good bits in it but you could see how the Queen was going to die from a mile away it was obvious.The Queen's death was very anticlimactic especially considering Charlize Theron was spouting the best quote in the entire film while she was burning alive then moments later Snow White puts an end to her reign and that's the end of it..the film was decent but nothing to special..the true highlights of the film are the dwarfs and the mirror man.
B0034G4P80|1.0|This is not a review of the movie, but the medium.  It appears to be unplayable (based on a sample of 2 DVDs) on linux based computers (vlc, smplayer, mplayer, xine, totem).  It may be playable on Windows based operating systems (unknown).  It did play on my dvd player.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|This movie was so funny from beginning to end.  I never paid much attention to Cameron Diaz but she is truly funny.  This movie actually made me laugh out loud.  I must commend the actors in this movie they all played a pivotal role even down to the guy that had to unlock the teacher's desk for Miss Squirrel.  I would love to see more comedies like this.  The world needs a good laugh.<br /><br />All of the other persons that gave it bad ratings I say to you.....\\"It's just a movie and lighten up\\".  All movies, (unless based on a true story) are fictional. It is what movies are all about.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|The storyline was okay. I don't know that it needed to be dragged out to 3 books.<br /><br />However, the fact that the publisher is charging more for the Kindle version than a paperback is making me reconsider purchasing either of the other 2 books in the series. It may not be much but it makes a difference to me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know everyone is reading or has read this book, so I ordered it for my Kindle.  As usual, very easy to order on Amazon, but I don't know when I last read a more poorly written book.  The main character sounds as if she is a pre-teen at a Justin Beiber concert.  And talk about implausible.  I guess this is supposed to be titillating, but I found it to be nothing of the sort.  If you want titillating, read \\"Endless Love\\" and it is well written.

1936608898|5.0|Imagine Yourself Healthier Than You Ever Thought Possible. Now imagine a book designed to help you do just that! It Starts with Food  is that book. Written by our good friends and nutrition partners, Dallas and Melissa Hartwig of Whole9,  It Starts with Food  will take you from science to skillet, leading you every step of the way as you begin the work of transforming your life beginning with what goes on your plate.<br /><br />It Starts with Food melds the science of how our body is designed to work in digesting our food and maintaining and repairing its many functions with the practical tools for providing ourselves optimal nutrition. Combining scientific research with clinical experience and self-experimentation,  It Starts with Food  focuses on food's role in \\"making us, here and now, more or less healthy.\\" The science-y information is made accessible with Dallas and Melissa's genius use of original analogies. (Find out how our bodies are like an exclusive members-only nightclub and our immune systems are a team of firefighters!) The practical info includes their signature Whole30 program, an elimination and self-awareness tool to get you started, as well as strategies for long-term success. Melissa Joulwan of The Clothes Make the Girl and Well Fed fame, collaborates with Dallas and Melissa on the book's Meal Map which will give you an abundance of meal ideas to  keep you nourished with food that makes you more healthy and vibrantly alive. While the Hartwig's offer the option of skipping over the whys of the program and moving straight to the hows, I highly recommend reading every single word. Only when we begin to understand our nutrition needs based on more than calories and weight management will we see the true benefits and necessities of choosing wisely the foods we eat and drink.<br /><br />Each of us has a relationship with food. For many of us that relationship has been dysfunctional for far too long. Let It Starts with Food help you begin to heal that relationship as you become healthier than you ever thought possible.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Normally, I close my Ebay shop when I go on vacation, but now that I own a tablet I decided to keep the shop going. I needed to monitor auctions, respond to question, start new listings (i.e. everything other than generate shipping labels).<br /><br />Ebay app works well on my Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet running Android HoneyComb 3.2. I had no technical problems. The app scales to my screen size, but is not aware that my screen is larger and does not make use of the width as well as at could. I have a lot of white space in the middle and the information is bunched up on the sides  which makes it harder to read.<br /><br />I found that the functionality for sellers does not have all the features I need to run my Ebay store while on the road.  I was able to monitor active auctions, but found that I can scroll through information faster if I use the non-mobile version of Ebay web site using a browser.  To see the same information I see in MyEbay I use the advanced search to display info by seller name (my own) and then customize the columns of the search results to show me the exact information I am interested in (removing some defaults and adding the useful to me info).<br /><br />Another feature that I used a 'relist' button since I wanted to avoid a lot of typing and start new auctions as fast as possible. Mobile Ebay displays unsold items, however the 'relist' button is not available on that page.  Mobile Ebay has a section from which you can relist, but on that page you can see just the items (title and image) without the dates when the items were listed in the past. I use the dates to help me to determine which items to relist. I found that using a non-mobile version of Ebay made my job easier.<br /><br />My plan was to use Ebay mobile app on this trip, but I found that it was missing enough small features that using the non-mobile Ebay site made my job faster and easier.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

While I really enjoyed 'Prey', and ate it up in the space of well inside a week, it never really soared like his best works have done.  As usual, the novel is based upon real science, upon real happenings in the world of science and technology that for me make his novels more compelling.  But the feeling of 'could this really happen?' somehow never hit me, as it did in Jurassic Park.  Yes, I know, it is a bit of a stretch to imagine bringing dinosaurs to life, but the extraordinary detail he delved into in JP, the highly detailed DNA methodologies that had the appearance of hard science at least made me really think.  In Prey, there were just too many 'Oh come on, that is ridiculous' types of developments that happened, things that went beyond any possible scientific explanation into sensationalism.  Also, the plotting just wasn't interesting enough.  No amazing twists, no 'wow' revelations, too much of a feeling that you knew in general where things were going.  Nonetheless, I give this novel a qualified recommendation.  If you are a Crichton fan and enjoyed novels like JP, Sphere, Disclosure, Airframe etc., you will like this one as well.  It has all his trademark attention to detail and captivating writing.  If you aren't a Crichton fan, maybe try Jurassic Park first.  Three and a half stars.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I bought this ebook without even trying the sample. The reviews were awesome on the TV!!! Then I started to read it and I was amazed that it was total dribble!!! I was gob smacked!!! What total rubbish E.L. James has written!!! I saw her on the interview and I know she was also gob smacked by the response to her book. I tried as much as possible to keep reading but it was so lame that I had to bin it (delete button)!!! I have now realised that just because it is a best seller, doesn't mean it's readable. This is just a silly teenage romance novel with a bit of sex thrown in!!! And I couldn't force myself to get to the sex part!!! All I can say is it was bland, boring and yes and totally colourless!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I simply love the book. I first watched the TV-show and got hooked. Then I read the book/books. I am done done with all of them but the first one was just epic. Haven't had a favorite book for a long time but \\"Game of Thrones\\" is one of the best reads. If you love detailed stories and characters who have all their reasons for their handling you should definitely read this. Five stars from me!
0765350386|5.0|Many people know about Brandon Sanderson because he's finishing up the Wheel of Time series, but I had sadly never heard of him before last year. Thankfully, a friend remedied this by loaning me the first in the Mistborn trilogy, and now I'm definitely addicted to Sanderson. He actually was at a convention in my area last year and I'm so upset with myself that I didn't know about him and therefore was not motivated to go!<br /><br />Title: The series is Mistborn trilogy, and the first book is also called Mistborn<br />Author: Brandon Sanderson<br />Length: Trilogy, each book is about 650 pages (paperback)<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />Unexpected but totally fitting plot twists<br />The first book stands alone wonderfully, and only at the end do you realize how much more there is to know about this world<br />Completely new (as far as I'm aware) magic systems! Metal is used as a fuel/storage for eight (to begin with) super human powers. Physics is also taken into account :D<br />Completely new and interesting cultures and races that are definitely not traditional fantasy.<br />Amazing battle scenes, wow can Sanderson write!<br />The characters are entertaining, and they get much better developed later on<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />I didn't get as attached to the characters as I do with some books, Sanderson is clearly a plot writer<br />The first book focuses a lot on political stuff as they work to bring down a dictatorship, and I had trouble keeping with it at first.<br />There is a lot of death and Sanderson does not always spare the details<br />Sanderson really wants you to fear and despise his bad guys, so he plays upon modern day fears with his Inquisitors (they have spikes through their eyes, gross)<br /><br />Summary: Really, really amazing books that I highly recommend, as long as you have the stomach for it. Sometimes they are scary, often they are a bit gory, but it's totally worth it for the amazing world that Sanderson has come up with.<br /><br />More reviews at [...]br />More reviews at [...]

0393061310|4.0|From my blog:<br /><br />Title: Guns, Germs, and Steel<br />Author: Jared Diamond<br /> Hours (audiobook): ~5 abridged copy<br /> Summary: For anyone who has ever wondered why the heck the European and Asian civilizations were able to make ships and conquer other civilizations, this book tries to figure that out. A lot of the problems of today's world comes from the inequities of the civilizations of the past, and at first blush it can be confusing to students of history why the Spanish made ships and guns before the people of South America. Diamond explains that a lot of the development of history's civilizations depended on the domestic-able plants and animals in the area and the fact that Europe and Asia have a major axis that goes East to West where as Africa and the Americas are oriented North to South. This actually makes a big difference in terms of how easily crops can be adapted from neighbors. The major geographic barriers also play a role in how easily ideas and inventions can get spread between cultures. All of this paints a fairly convincing story of why people in one area progressed so much faster than others, giving us the world we currently have.<br /><br />As stated above, I only listened to the abridged audiobook of this book because that is what I had available, but I found the audiobook still very enlightening, unlike most abridged books that I've encountered. The full paper book is quite long, and so if you want an idea of the argument but not all the gory details, I do recommend the abridged version. In any case, I think this book makes a very important argument because it presents evidence that it wasn't something special about the genes of the people who became the conquerors, it was simply the luck of the land that they happened to inherit.<br /><br />More reviews at [...]

0307957837|5.0|From my blog:<br /><br />There were a number of classic series that came out during my adolescence, and I really wish His Dark Materials had gotten more popular. I realize that all the religious changes in the third book got some people a bit huffy, but I really think that Pullman came up with some quality outside of the box worlds in this trilogy. If you've only see the \\"Golden Compass\\" movie, then honestly you don't know what you're missing. The trilogy is so different than the first book or movie and you should read them!<br /><br />Title: His Dark Materials (The Golden Compass is the first book)<br />Author: Philip Pullman<br />Pages: ~400 each (paperback)<br />Setting: The trilogy begins in an alternate UK, however our world is actually just a stone's throw away if you can step between realities! Several different and very interesting realities/worlds are visited in this trilogy, some rather conventional and some not at all!<br />Premise: Lyra is the main character and she has a furry friend named Pan who is a reflection/part of her soul and changes shapes between lots of different animals. The first book is a typical plot about a bad/mysterious group kidnapping children and Lyra going to save them, but later in the trilogy things get much more philosophical. There is actually a whole lot more going on across all the parallel universes and Lyra and some other friends she meets along the way need to figure it out before Everything is destroyed.<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />A very interesting take on religion in the multiple worlds<br />Female main character<br />Fuzzy animals companions :D<br />The trilogy has a completely different plot than you think after the first book (and movie)<br />Very awesome supporting characters and very moving death scenes (not telling who though!)<br />Pretty easy read, though it does get emotional occasionally (you might cry in an airport if you aren't careful >.>)<br />Some really interesting worlds that Pullman came up with!<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br /> Because of the reinterpretation of religions, this might not be a good book for strongly religious people, specifically Christians might not appreciate how God is portrayed<br />The last book of the trilogy is not nearly as child-friendly as the first<br />The second and third books have a very different feel from the first book/movie, which might be a good or a bad thing depending on your perspective<br />If you cry at books, these will probably make you cry<br />I might just be weird, but I'm easily spooked by books/television shows and there are some spooky parts in this book involving dead people<br /><br />Summary: Very good trilogy with a much more complicated and intricate plot than what the first book suggests. I highly recommend these books if you aren't going to be insulted by some interesting reinterpretations of religion, specifically Christianity. The worlds that Pullman came up with and connected together are fantastically done in my opinion. These books are easy to read and easy to love I think and should totally be on a summer reading list!<br /><br />More reviews at [...]<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br /> Because of the reinterpretation of religions, this might not be a good book for strongly religious people, specifically Christians might not appreciate how God is portrayed<br />The last book of the trilogy is not nearly as child-friendly as the first<br />The second and third books have a very different feel from the first book/movie, which might be a good or a bad thing depending on your perspective<br />If you cry at books, these will probably make you cry<br />I might just be weird, but I'm easily spooked by books/television shows and there are some spooky parts in this book involving dead people<br /><br />Summary: Very good trilogy with a much more complicated and intricate plot than what the first book suggests.

0756405890|5.0|From my blog:<br /><br />Back to fantasy :D. The second book in this series just came out several months ago (it took me forever to finally finish up the book, stupid germs) and so it is fresh on my mind, whereas I read the first book also when it was freshly released and that was a while ago. This all adds up to me mostly focusing on the second book in this trilogy, but highly recommend the trilogy in general if the traits listed here sound good to you because they apply to both ;-). Also, a good friend helped me with this post because I needed assistance in remembering the first book &lt;3.<br /><br />Title: The Kingkiller Chronicle (first book is The Name of the Wind)<br />Author: Patrick Rothfuss<br />Pages: ~1000 pages each (yes, they are long books ) hardcover<br />Setting: Most of the places of the world are rural farming communities with nobility thrown in enough places to make everyone else's lives difficult. There is a king (allowing for the title...), but there is also a school called the University that teaches magic (and other useful things) to anyone who can pay the tuition and pass the tests (the tuition varies based on how your admissions exam goes :D). This world does not have the same storybook magic that peasants whisper about. The real magic is complicated and slightly based on physics and very interesting. There are also a fair number of different cultures that have their own secrets to learn.<br />Premise: The main character, Kote/Kvothe , is retelling the story of his life in the inn that he owns as an adult to a traveling scribe. His life has been the source of great stories that are becoming legendary and he wants to get the real story down. The world around them also appears to be in a state of deadly chaos, though we haven't exactly figured out why. Most of the first two books center on his life at the University and a few extra travels he has during that time, with interludes of what is happening in the current world thrown in as people burst through the door.<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />Absolutely wonderful world building!<br />The \\"hero\\" isn't really a hero, but he is a very interesting main character with all of the delicious ambiguity that goes along with a semi-self-aware first person narrative<br />Along the same lines, this is not a hero story, it is the story of the man behind the legends and this is quite well done. It happens often that Kvothe will overhear a story that is obviously about him but has already started morphing into the legend of Kvothe the Arcane and the contrasts are very entertaining and interesting.<br />The writing style is quite descriptive in a just right way. Rothfuss is able to strike a good balance between giving you a mental picture of what is going but not boring you with details.<br />The villains (of which there are a few of varying degrees) are quite well done and the variety is nice. There is the prickish jerk who you just want to slap and the terrifying demon thing that wonderfully unsettles you (and a few in between those extremes).<br />Some highly entertaining side characters!<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />While Kvothe's adventures are entertaining, there just seem to be too many side plots to me. Perhaps they will all be wonderfully wrapped together in the third book, but there are a lot of times that I sat back wondering what these side adventures have to do with Kvothe's overarching goals (to kill the really really bad guy).<br />Along those lines, there is a lot of focus on subvillians, who are awesome, but it seems to be to the detriment of our hate/fear of the Big Bad who just isn't involved in the first two books that much....<br />Kvothe's life kind of really sucks at times and I was definitely drawn into the story to the point of being a bit stressed when he was stressed, ha.<br />The first two books cover about 3 years of his life, and there are at least 10 more years to go probably before reaching the current time, so how that is goingto get fit into the final book in the trilogy is a mystery to me.<br />I realized after finishing the first two books that the side characters are rather not persistent. They pop into Kvothe's life for a while, then he runs off and meets side characters, and sometimes they pop back in, but there is no Robin to this Batman, which can give a bit of character vertigo....<br /><br />Summary: Really these are excellent books so far! They aren't quite traditional in their plot landscape, but I'm really hoping that it all makes sense in the third book because the world and characters are just wonderful. I very much enjoy reading them, though they are long (my friend read them both in four days though...). I really recommend this trilogy to anyone that likes fantasy that is a bit off the beaten path but still epic!<br /><br />More reviews at[...]to get fit into the final book in the trilogy is a mystery to me.<br />I realized after finishing the first two books that the side characters are rather not persistent.

0545265355|4.0|I saw the movie first and it sparked me to read the trilogy book set.. I would recommend the books to everyone of all ages and genders who like futuristic secret society suspense.. The demographic of the books seem to target teenage and twenty something girls but it is a great read for everyone.. I am a 34 year old male and I enjoyed the storyline and suspense.. Good read and Great story highly recommend.
0060558121|4.0|From my blog:<br /><br />The first exposure I had to Neil Gaiman was reading Stardust while tromping around Germany in high school. It was an interesting experience. It took me a bit of talking to people to realize that Gaiman was aiming for a trippy experience that purposefully broke the confines of traditional writing (or something like that). Then I read American Gods when I was in Germany the second time (I'm sensing a strange theme....) and I enjoyed it much much more. I also find it amusing that my dad had been trying to get me to read it for ages and it took homesickness to finally make me listen. That and it was one of the only books that I had heard of in the English fiction section of the German bookstore. It's still a bit trippy, but it is a road trip in book form with some old gods thrown in for variety, which is about what you would expect from Gaiman.<br /><br />Title: American Gods<br />Author: Neil Gaiman<br />Length: 588 pages (paperback)<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />Interesting, out-of-the-box, but well done characters<br />It takes place in real towns in the US<br />The plot is trippy but very interesting and as long as you accept that it won't be perfectly logical, you'll probably have a good time<br />Who doesn't love random gods from random old religions popping up?<br />While we're on it, who doesn't love learning about all of the most random tourist attractions in the states.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />I don't really remember the end of the plot, but I think it got much more illogical toward the end, and I definitely don't remember how things all ended up being connected, which could be meaningless, or a bad sign<br />No romance, all trippy comedy (not necessarily a bad thing, just saying)<br />It's a bit long when I look at it again, though it didn't seem long at the time, but that could just be the homesickness<br /><br />Summary: It was a New York Times bestseller for a reason. It really is a good read if you are all right with feeling a bit disoriented at times when you are reading, and from the Neil Gaiman I've read, it's the tamest so far (of the two I've read >.>). I always find references to old gods from dead religions highly entertaining and interesting, and the way they explain things about what happens to gods when their religions die out actually makes a lot of sense. It's a pretty easy read, though not a fast one unless you have nothing to do while you sit on a bus.<br /><br />More reviews at [...]feeling a bit disoriented at times when you are reading, and from the Neil Gaiman I've read, it's the tamest so far (of the two I've read >.>).

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Someone in my book club picked this book, forcing all of us to read the entire series!  Nevertheless, we all enjoyed the series and look forward to other books by Suzanne Collins, although we are looking for the next big thing.  Hope to find a good summer read.
0060853972|4.0|From my blog:<br /><br />I got Good Omens on loan from one of my friends this summer and read it pretty quickly due to a combination of plane flights and good writing. She actually lent it to me to convince me to read more Terry Pratchett and to try to convince me that I'll like Neil Gaiman. For someone who claims to not like Gaiman, I do seem to read a lot of him, ha.<br /><br />Title: Good Omens<br />Author: Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett<br />Pages: 412 paperback<br />Genre-ish: Apocalyptic comedy<br />Setting: Our world for the most part, but demons and angels hang around drinking wine together and there is a book of prophecies that are quite nice and accurate according to the witch who wrote it. Oh and it's sometime in the future, exactly one week before the apocalypse.<br />Premise: The main characters include an angel trying to avert the apocalypse, a demon who realized he kind of likes the Earth the way it is, and the son of Satan who got mixed up when he was a baby and might not be as evil as was planned.<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />Very well written, couldn't put it down, which was convenient since I was reading it on a plane<br />Laugh out loud funny at times, as you would expect from these authors<br />Clever, they incorporated a lot of the mythical apocalypse stuff in fresh ways, such as the four horse(wo!)men riding motorcycles and not quite being the original myths<br />If you like Gaiman's cooky characters and ideas, then you won't be disappointed<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />I didn't get very attached to the main characters, partially because they were all male, and partially because I just can't get attached to characters that Gaiman writes apparently<br />I had a strange feeling of \\"Huh, why did I just read that?\\" when I was done, because again Gaiman has a style of characters and world that I just don't care about, despite the fact that the writing was very compelling<br />It does stomp on modern day religious beliefs a bit, so if you will be insulted by that, probably not a good idea<br /><br />Summary:<br />Like I said above, I read this book quite quickly over the course of a vacation and a few days, because the writing is very compelling and funny. However, I feel absolutely no wish to re-read the book ever or read sequels if there were any because I simply didn't get attached to the characters or the world at all, though I think this is just something that happens when I read Gaiman. The plot is interesting and rich, the writing is good, and if you like Gaiman then you should definitely read this book. If you don't like Gaiman, like me, you'll probably still enjoy it, but maybe not LOVE it like a lot of people do.<br /><br />More reviews at [...]will be insulted by that, probably not a good idea<br /><br />Summary:<br />Like I said above, I read this book quite quickly over the course of a vacation and a few days, because the writing is very compelling and funny.

0439023521|5.0|From my blog:<br /><br />This is one of the books that I received for my birthday which was only a couple weeks ago and I read it in the span of a few days. I would have read it faster if school didn't get in my way so much, but the speed bumps did let me savor the story a bit more. I had heard wonderful things about this book and was excited to read it and am happy to report that it lived up to expectations. There is a movie coming out soon (or it might already be out by the time this is posted) based on the book and I'm looking forward to seeing how they pull off all the places that special effects could be awesome.<br /><br />Title: The Hunger Games<br />Author: Suzanne Collins<br />Pages: 374 paperback<br />Setting: Panem is what is left of North America after a series of extreme weather, earth quakes and civil unrest changed the face of our planet. The Capitol rules over 12 Districts in a brutally unfair government where people in the districts are always starving and people in the Capitol live in luxury as long as they don't say anything against the Capitol.<br />Premise: In this dystopia the Capitol does many things to keep the districts in line, one of which is the Hunger Games. Every year one girl and one boy between 12-18 are chosen from each district to compete to the death in a survival arena that is completely controlled by the Gamemakers who want the show to be compelling for the entire nation watching live. Katniss Everdeen ends up being one of the two from her district, though her district hasn't won in the last decade or more so things don't look very good....<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />The pace is surprisingly well done for a story that is about a non-stop fight for survival; I normally get stressed out with those sorts of stories but found this very well paced<br />The story is written in first person present tense, which is at first a little weird, but it fits nicely once you get used to it<br />Some wonderful supporting characters who really come alive despite the story being told in first person<br />Collins uses the tech of this futuristic society in interesting ways and has some fun new ideas for what a futuristic society looks like<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />I didn't get all that attached to Katniss despite her being the main character; I ended up caring a lot more about various supporting characters<br />The teenage angst gets a bit annoying because of Katniss' density towards human interactions<br />The book ends on teenage angst, which I just really hated, and I'm not planning to read the next book specifically because it picks up exactly where this one ended<br />The book takes place almost entirely in the Games, which is appropriate given the title, but I wish I could learn more about the rest of the world<br /><br />Summary:<br />I did really enjoy this book as evidenced by the fact that I tore through it so quickly. It isn't too hard of a read since it's obviously aimed at a young adult audience, but it is still emotionally captivating for an older audience if you can ignore the angsty parts. It's great for trips since you'll totally forget about your three hour plane ride, though if you cry at books, you'll probably cry a little. I really wish the next books had more compelling plots, but from talking to people and reading summaries, it feels like Collins is trying to stretch this good idea into too long of a series, which is disappointing given the interesting things that can happen in dystopias run by corrupt governments.

B00756GKBA|4.0|I've written several Madonna reviews before this one but, in all honesty, MDNA is by far the most difficult to critique. This is one of those albums that appears to be ahead of its time, like many a Madonna album before it - case in point: Erotica. No tracks glared out as clear winners from the onset, bar one - \\"I'm addicted\\", probably Madonna's most powerful and hypnotically poetic dance track since 2005's \\"Jump\\". The album improves vastly after a few listens, and one starts to find a few possible singles releases, like Girl Gone Wild and Turn Up the Radio. In all honesty, Give Me All Your Luvin' was a disaster and clearly relied on its guest singers to pull a chart success out of the hat. Alas, it was probably Madonna's worst ever lead single off any album - dreadful to say the least. What escapes me is why a beautiful ballad like Masterpiece was never considered as a release in the mainstream. It must surely be Madonna's best ballad since Frozen, released fourteen years before. Something that cannot go unnoticed on this album is the fact that Madonna seems to have borrowed several rifts from some of her former tracks. Girl Gone Wild starts off as a sister track to Confessions' \\"Sorry\\" and \\"I'm a Sinner\\" is a dead ringer for \\"Beautiful Stranger\\". On the whole, it's an interesting and hypnotic album with quite a few catchy numbers, but with several that are simply forgettable. This album is sound, but (and it pains me to say it) not quite the Madonna of days gone by. I probably echo the sentiments of many older fans when I ask that Madonna bring back the likes of Patrick Leonard and Shep Pettibone!
0441013597|5.0|From my blog:<br /><br />Last year I got it in my head that I wanted to read all those classics that true sci-fi book nerds are supposed to have read, and Dune was definitely on that list. When I am mentally able, I really love a good classic sci-fi novel. There is something so satisfying about the slower pace and lack of hand-holding of the classic style. Dune is an excellent example of this style in fact, something that makes it wonderful if that is what you are looking for, but horrible if you just pick it up at the airport because it looks interesting and you are bored....<br /><br />Title: Dune<br />Author: Frank Herbert<br />Pages: 474 (paperback and not including the appendices)<br />Premise: Paul Atreides noble family moves to the desert planet Arrakis only sort of against their wishes. The people on this planet have some strange legends that Paul's mother seems to have some hand in and a political plot against his family is soon making their lives even more interesting. As they then deal with the repercussions of those plots, it becomes clear that those legends are much more than just legend.<br />Setting: Arrakis is a harsh world that holds a great treasure: spice. It is fairly addictive, has wonderful health and mental benefits and attracts GIANT worms on the already fairly inhospitable planet. Those worms are also attracted simply by the patterned vibration of walking on sand though, so it's not really the spice's fault if you get eaten harvesting it. The native people, however, have found ways to deal with all these difficulties and so have free access to the spice. Between their diet and their adaptations to the harsh environment, they have some very interesting differences both biologically and culturally.<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />Absolutely amazing world building<br />Very well thought out native culture<br />Complicated and well developed political structure<br />Interesting character development<br />Very cool ways of describing the psychic sort of powers that develop<br />Eco-friendly message :D<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />If you aren't that interesting in political intrigue, the politics get a bit boring in the beginning<br />A complicated world means that there is a steep learning curve for the vocabulary and customs for the reader<br />The book is definitely more world focused than character focused<br />As I said in the intro, it is classic sci-fi and so it is definitely not an easy read<br /><br />Summary: It's classic for a reason and got a lot of awards and recognition.

0553386794|4.0|From my blog:<br /><br />A Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin is the first in the A Song of Ice and Fire series and is the story of adventure, family and intrigue in a world were winters last for years, dragons fly, nobels fight and White Walkers stalk the night; it's also not for the faint of heart<br /><br />There is a lot of hype around this series that is now an HBO series as well, and it's honestly well deserved. Martin weaves many perspectives together to create an intricate and captivating plot. That plot also unfortunately involves a lot of sexual violence, which has brought a fair amount of criticism to the series. If you go into the book knowing that that is the case, however, it can be an excellent read and I look forward to the rest.<br /><br />Goodreads<br />Title: A Game of Thrones<br />Author: George R. R. Martin<br />Pages: ~800 pages (paperback, first in series)<br />Genre-ish: Adult Fantasy, through and through<br />Rating: ''''' - Really great story, jarring flaws for some<br />Setting: A Game of Thrones is set in a world where summers and winters last for years, and the most recent summer has been the longest in a while, meaning that the coming winter could last decades. It is a world of kings, queens and all the intrigue that comes with court, as well as dragons (though they have been long absent from the land) and white walkers (though they are just ghost stories... right?).<br />Premise: The recent rebellion has left King Robert on the throne with a treacherous wife and exiled the children of the former king. Robert has asked his dearest friend Ned to come to court to be his right hand and rule the kingdom that Robert has no interest in. Robert's wife has other plans, however, and as A Game of Thrones says, \\"In the game of thrones, you win or you die.\\"<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />A very intricate plot that is woven throughout the book<br />The setting is a nice twist on traditional fantasy, with the extinct dragons (but skulls to show their existance) and years-long seasons, oh and direwolves<br />Well developed characters that all have their own strengths and weaknesses and reasons for their actions<br />Large world and the spread out characters and perspectives allows for a lot of world building<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />As many critics of the series have pointed out, there is a lot of incest, rape, statutory rape (by our definition of adult), molesting and violence towards women; as someone who has stopped reading a trilogy because of sexual violence, I didn't find that it broke the book, just a bit excessive, but you've been warned.<br />Most of the characters are in a grey area, so it's hard to really pick out the \\"good guys\\" and \\"villains\\" past the few obvious ones, so A Game of Thrones is definitely not an easy read.<br />I'm still trying to figure out how it could be possible for a planet to have erratic and extremely lengthened seasons from an astronomical perspective and it's just not working for me; I realize this is fantasy and dragons aren't real either, but the seasons just don't fall under the same \\"it's fantasy\\" excuse to me....<br />I'm personally not a fan of multiple perspectives, because I find the character switches jarring, but that's just me :)<br /><br />Summary:<br />This series is turning out to be very controversial, and I don't especially agree with a lot of the criticism that has been thrown onto what I found to be a rather enjoyable plot. I don't find the violence overly disturbing or detailed (though if Martin could stop using the word \\"nipple\\" so much I'd be happier), and I found that I could still easily enjoy the deep characters and wonderfully woven plot for their own merit. If you think you can handle the  grittier scenes, I really recommend this series, as most people seem to be doing these days.<br /><br />More reviews at [...]their existance) and years-long seasons, oh and direwolves<br />Well developed characters that all have their own strengths and weaknesses and reasons for their actions<br />Large world and the spread out characters and perspectives allows for a lot of world building<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />As many critics of the series have pointed out, there is a lot of incest, rape, statutory rape (by our definition of adult), molesting and violence towards women; as someone who has stopped reading a trilogy because of sexual violence, I didn't find that it broke the book, just a bit excessive, but you've been warned.<br />Most of the characters are in a grey area, so it's hard to really pick out the \\"good guys\\" and \\"villains\\" past the few obvious ones, so A Game of Thrones is definitely not an easy read.<br />I'm still trying to figure out how it could be possible for a planet to have erratic and extremely lengthened seasons from an astronomical perspective and it's just not working for me; I realize this is fantasy and dragons aren't real either, but the seasons just don't fall under the same \\"it's fantasy\\" excuse to me....<br />I'm personally not a fan of multiple perspectives, because I find the character switches jarring, but that's just me :)<br /><br />Summary:<br />This series is turning out to be very controversial, and I don't especially agree with a lot of the criticism that has been thrown onto what I found to be a rather enjoyable plot.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|its a great Bible but it always updates but I don't want it to .....ahhhhhhhhhh<br />so wish it would quit.<br />,
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It was better than i expected from the avengers. In my opinion this movie was way better than all the individual movies. I greatly enjoyed it and watched it 4 times in thearters and once i get the movie ill watch it as many times as i can.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is really great. It helps me get involved more with the Bible.I can make plans and the app will remind me to read. When you are using the Bible, it will read to you and I love it. I highly recommend it for anyone.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I love the erotic stories. This one did not contain much of that for me. The details of the sexual encounters were not doing it for me. I do love the twist of dark side of the sexual needs that was shown however. The story line is what held me. I read all three in about 1 1/2 wks. That is quick reading for me. I will support this author again because the story line itself held me attention.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I was so into this book and wanted to know what happened in the end. The book ended terrible and I wish i was another book so that the author would have had to cram everything in at the last minute. Some of the stuff wasn't even answered in the end and it kind of left you hanging.. Overall the series was really good though.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a awesome game! Even though it may be hard it I ls fun to play when u have nothing to do!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My son loves this game, and I admit I've become kind of addicted too. The only things I don't like is the one touch purchasing. It's also kind of tough to get acorns and some of the things require a lot of acorns to get them
0312944926|3.0|Posting this review due to assignment in College English class.  If you have not read this book then don't read the below because it is a spoiler.  Although the reviews above give this book a 1 or 2 star rating, I believe it rates better.  I'm not a computer programmer so I could see how one maybe offended.  This is not Angels and Demons or The Davinci Code nor does it have the same mystical setting associated with those two.  This is just another book which makes you think.<br /><br />  The Plot and Structure of<br />  Dan Brown's Digital Fortress<br />  Robert Stout<br />  English 102<br />  Professor Weatherly<br />  June 13, 2012<br /> Digital Fortress has many twists and turns similar to any of the other books authored by Dan Brown.  Just when you believe you have captured the idea of the story he throws you into another intriguing turn.  As quoted by The Midwest Book Review, \\"Digital Fortress is the best and most realistic techno-thriller to reach the market in years... A chilling thrill a minute\\".<br /> Digital Fortress begins when the NSA experiences an issue with their top code breaking machine, TRANSLTR, \\"the single most expensive piece of computing equipment in the world- a machine the NSA swore did not exist\\".  TRANSLTR discovers a code that can not be broken and the NSA's best cryptographer, Susan Fletcher discovers a plot to bring down the machine and expose National intelligence secrets.<br /> Susan was preparing for a relaxing weekend with the man she loves when she received the call.  A weekend drastically changed into a life threatening and a time crucial dilemma.  Unknown to Susan at the time, her boyfriend, David Becker, received a call from Susan's boss, Trevor Strathmore, asking him to fly to Spain and retrieve a ring from a man, Ensei Tankado, who had passed away.<br /> When Susan arrives at work she learns that an ex-employee of the NSA, Tankado, has written an encrypted program which can not be broken and has an accomplice by the name of NDAKOTA.  While tracing an email sent between Tankado and NDAKOTA, Susan learns that a co-worker Greg Hale was Tankado's accomplice who was in the building with her.<br /> Mean while David arrives in Spain and learns that the ring he is looking for has been passed to a couple in the park where Tankado had died.  Every time David is getting close to achieving his task, he learns the ring was passed to another.  David spends his entire day tracking leads and eventually running for his life while still trying to locate the ring.<br /> Susan and Strathmore are pushed into making a decision, a decision between trusting that David will find the ring or shutdown TRANSLTR to stop the release of intelligence secrets.  Both believed that the ring contained the password needed to shutdown the code, but neither had 100 percent confidence that David would achieve his objective.  When they chose to reboot TRANSLTR, the cooling system is damaged and starts over heating, which explodes and takes the life of NSA's deputy director of operations.<br /> After the explosion of TRANSLTR, David narrowly escapes death and obtains the ring.  The head director of the NSA and all cryptographers are working to stop the code from being released and cripple the United States interests.  Susan and David are at a cross roads when they learn the rings letters do not stop the code from releasing.  Time is running out and with only seconds to spare, David and Susan found the kill code for the program saving a majority of the sensitive information.<br /> Relieved that they were successful and safe from harm Susan and David spend their weekend at Stone Manor.  They discuss David's future at the college and returning to teaching.  Unexpected to Susan, David proposes to her.<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read about mystery and intrigue.  Like Publishers Weekly review, \\"In this fast-paced, plausible tale, Brown blurs the line between good and evil enough to delight patriots and paranoids alike\\".  I guarantee once you pick up this book, you will have trouble putting it down.<br /><br />  Reference:<br />Brown, D. (1998). Digital Fortress, St. Martin's Press, New York, NY
1572816295|5.0|I was so excited to get my first tarot card deck and when I took them out, they were a bit smaller than I thought they'd be but they are still worth buying! I love her style of artwork and love how she appreciates Victorian era styles, and New Orleans. You can tell she put lots of effort into this deck and I can't wait to use them! These are a must buy for any tarot card user!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This is a fun and addicting game, some hints would be nice though, maybe even a little music.  Can't put it down.
030758836X|4.0|This book was definitely interesting - I thought the last 50 pages dragged and I definitely did not like the ending.  Most of the book was very intense and I couldn't put it down but again, did not like the ending.
B005HSL626|5.0|it is the coolest. game In the word!!!!! love love!!!!!!!!!!! I love fruit ninja and I love friuit too!!!  I have lt on my ipod too!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is so fun and very few glitches.  Not too simple, still offers a good challenge, fun for all!
B000FC1LOC|4.0|This book is perfect for teenagers! It challenges the morality of \\"designer babys\\". Such a beautiful story and it is the perfect length. It is a book that both a daughter and a mother can read and still get great message out of it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I originally held off purchasing the book due to so many negative reviews.  But, after hearing so much about it I just had to find out for myself.<br /><br />I just completed the trilogy and wish there were more.  I loved the book.  I fell in love with the fairy tale romance and the happily ever after ending.  The sex scenes were good and very creative although I found myself wondering, can they really have sex that often?  I've been married for a few years so it has opened up my eyes to a few things.<br /><br />Yes, the writing can be a little annoying at times, also some people referred to it as stalking but I didn't see that at all.  It was more of a pursuit to catch the interest of someone you met in passing.  Other people mentioned that the young lady gets abused but again, it seemed like kinky sex to me.  I'm so glad I read the trilogy and am looking for other books like it.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Favorite quote of the movie: (When Soren meets his hero)<br />\\"This is what it actually looks like when you've fought in battle. It's not glorious, it's not beautiful, it's not even heroic. It's merely doing what's right and doing it again and again. Even if someday you look like this.\\" Ezylryb, Legend Of The Guardians<br /><br />Stunning visuals. The plot is really beautiful story about bravery and friendship. I am absolutely in love with this movie. Hopefully, there will be a sequel. I am keeping my fingers crossed.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is an amazing type of puzzle. The instructions are easy to understand, but there is a wide variety of difficulty. Love, love, love it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|better than farmville and cant wait to play it again and again. After all Gameloft did make it and they did a wonderful job doing so.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a great case. It's durable and protects all parts of your iPhone from scratches. I haven't dropped my phone with it on, but the material feels that it would absorb most of the shock from a fall. I didn't use the screen protector so I can't comment on that. I also love that you can still see the Apple logo on the back through the case.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is fun. i used to love playing it when i was a kid. i think you would like it too.
B001224WBS|5.0|Awesome for all of the fans out there...been following them since the begining. Wanted a great tight package for there best!
B00475AYJQ|2.0|I bought this book the first day it was released.  I really enjoyed \\"The Name of the Wind\\" and couldn't wait for book 2.<br /><br />This book is terrible.  It is overlong, trite and filled with a meandering plot that never grasps you.  I honestly don't know how I managed to finish the entire book.<br /><br />I doubt I'll be reading book 3 - and if I do, I certainly won't be buying it.  This one sucks!  Stay away!
B002ZG97LK|5.0|The entire cast is pitch perfect. The storyline is fleshed out with much needed backstory. The music is awesome. And the dancing is amazing. Totally worth watching. It'll make you want to get up and dance.
1612130283|5.0|I agree with alot of these other reviewers. This book was amazing!!!!  I'm looking forward to reading the next two books.  It is a page turner, hot, sexy, and as another said you can't get anything else done cause you want to read the book. Also, when your not reading it you are thinking about it!!  I thought the writing was very well done with some humor and alot of sexiness.  I would recommend this book to any adult!!!!
0345529057|5.0|Books based on the movie or the movie based on the book? Either way, this series is a boxed 4-pack and a good value. It was a gift for someone and was well received, just what they were hoping for...happy reading!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|[[ASIN:B007I2BZIE Clockwork Angels]]I'm no master reviewer and certainly no critic, but I have been a long time fan, and I've been privately critical but always in an attempt to be constructive.  There is a certain recklessness -a \\"hey we've been at this for a while and we can do what the hell we want\\"  There is a mature curiosity mixed with a restlessness on this album that is SO refreshing.<br /><br />I've noticed differences vocally, and a meanness in the instruments that shows this restlessness, yet a sensibility that is expressed in the melodies.  Keep it up Rush!  You're are one of the ONLY bands this side of the Atlantic that shows this drive, and are certainly emulated on the other side of the Atlantic for your tenacity.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game ruuuuules it is such a great game to playnwhen you are bored<br /> my friend has this game and i love it just like mario bros!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|So everyone said I just HAD to read 50 Shades of Grey and I heard of friends who are not avid readers, reading books 1 & 2 in a matter of days.  The book starts off great, had a few spots that are kind of dry and the writing isn't the greatest but you never see the end of Book 1 coming.  I just started book 2 and it's starting out just as well as book 1.  I bought books 2 & 3 yesterday and luckily could download them to my phone so I'll have them at the ready when I go on vacation in a couple of weeks.  YAY!
B00845PV16|1.0|Worst movie ever, if the movie studio had to much money and needed to get rid of it that badly, they should have just burned the money and taped it. It would have been better than this pile of trash.
0345529057|5.0|Just as ordered. These are books. I ordered a matching serial set of 4 books, and received a matching serial set of 4 books. They were not in order in the case, but that has been remedied.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice calculator; I especially like the virtual tape feature that lets you look back through a series of earlier calculations.  The cut and paste functionality is well done too!  Hard to beat, even at twice the price!!
B000002H97|4.0|A lot of people hate on this record, which isn't justified. This album is heavy and full of great songs. It may not be in the league of Kill 'Em All, Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets, but not very many records are! Front to back every track is good and this is money well spent, ROCK ON!!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I don't even have word/excel/etc on my notebook!  I think it's pretty good with obvious limitations depending on your screen size...  And you can purchase font upgrade pkg, but it is not required.  No other upgrade is even available.  Nice little pkg.  Looking real good on Kindle Fire.  &quot;Get it while you can,&quot;  Janis would say!
B001BEG2LK|5.0|Powerslave is a fantastic record. Awesome vocals and out of this world guitar riffs rule the day! Every song is good and if you like heavy metal music you will not be disappointed. It's definitely one of Maiden's best and that is saying a lot. Up the Irons metal heads!!
B003Y5H5F6|3.0|Unlike some others in this series, the latest installment - number 4 - is a relatively straight narrative, and mercifully short at 88 minutes. Non-stop shooting, stabbing, blood and gore, of course. That's par for this series, and you would not have gotten this far if you can't take it. But this one feels like part 1 of a two-part film, which they simply broke in two to make more money by putting out two separate movies. It ends before it really even gets going. The big mystery is what powers the little werewolf girl hybrid really has that she hasn't discovered yet. Well, you won't find out by watching this. The Lykans have evolved into huge dinosaur-like creatures by the ending here. The werewolves are almost all killed off. Their turn to rise again is next.
B000W1ZEGW|5.0|Tbis record is a masterpiece. The late great Dio delivers with his powerhouse vocals and the bass, guitar and drums are all definitive heavy metal homeruns! Just get the record, you won't regret it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game it is super fun and challenges the brain! I really like how if u get stuck in the game their is a help button that can give u a lot of help.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I could not finish this book unlike the first, which I read in a few hours....the constant fighting between the whiny Ana and Christian gets old quick. The story seemed just drag on and on and on till I couldn't take it anymore and requested a refund
B0086700CM|5.0|Anytime I am bored I can count on temple run to help. It is fun, and the graphics are pretty good. Simple to play this game also.
B002M9WW30|3.0|The Movies are Immortal ok save for Rocky V Rocky V was a mess and Rocky IV as much as we all love it...is a joke. But Hey Rocky I-IV Immortal tales of rising up digging deep and while you get beat down...keep getting up and never give in!<br /><br />MGM never got the memo and thus when the movies were transferred to HD they suffered more grain than a Cambodian rice patty. While there is an extras disc alot of DVD extras didn't make the way over.<br /><br />But this is as good as the immortal movies are going to look unless MGM takes time to clean up the originals and do a remaster for a future anniversary.<br /><br />If you want rocky looking the best he ever has...wait. But if you need your Rocky Fix or want to teach you children how to step it up and never back down. Well no brainier buy this set.<br /><br />Rocky deserved better than this. A remaster of Rocky I-IV and Balboa no Rocky V (NOBODY wants Rocky V) with commentaries for each film would be perfect but for now, if this is all we get I'm semi satisfied.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have had a lot of fun playing this game! Love the movie? You will definitely enjoy playing the game!
B003C5FMEE|5.0|Great music, takes you back to NOLA. If you like trombone this is for you.  Shipped timely and in good shape.
B0086700CM|5.0|A very addictive game. I has really nice graphics. I'm hooked on it and I can't help but play it ever time I'm on my Kindle Fire.
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|Overall, Analog Man is a come back for Joe Walsh, although it's not as good as his best solo efforts with the assistance of Joe Vitale.  There Goes The Neighborhood, which was released in 1981, was Joe's last album where every song was enjoyable.  Things drastically began to go downhill, with the release of You Bought It, You Name it, and it was incredibly disappointing  to hear some of the music Joe released since that album.  On Analog Man, Joe Vitale plays keyboard only on the song And The Band Played On, although I was hoping to hear his signature drumming, flute and vocals throughout this new release as well.  But, as we all know, people are constantly growing and changing and Analog Man is a welcome come back for Joe Walsh, compared to what we've heard from Joe in the past 30 years.  Even though there is nothing like Theme From The Boat or Island Weirdos on this album, it's a welcome come back which I enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|of all the games on the app market this is the best and most enjoyable. a must have for any kindle fire User.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I LOVED THE ACTION & SCENERY.A VERY ENTERTAINING EXCITING ACTION TYPE MOVIE.IF YOU LIKE SYFY YOU WILL ENJOY THIS ONE.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very well organized and presented,  perhaps more games for small kids for development of knowledge skills, keep the good work and creativity
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF ROBIN HOOD MOVIES BUT THIS ONE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. RUSSEL CROWE PLAYS THE PART VERY WELL.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Pack seems to be well made.  lots of compartments available for virtually everything except your laptop.  good padding. pleasantly surprised.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I have a love hate relationship with this game but I just keep playing.<br /><br />love the new slow motion and shield options too
1466401885|5.0|Great book! A must read for sure. If you liked FSOG or the Crossfire series you'll love these IMO. Everyone of my girlfriends who read those books have loved this one as well.
158270208X|3.0|I appreciate the purpose and love the intent and appreciation but for me, it is too beautiful for me to wtite in.  I guess this is my lesson in I am not good enough to write in something so beautiful.
B005BX3NAA|4.0|It's been years since I paid attention to 80's hard rock in anything other than an ironic way. Those goofy white guys in their jean shorts with their guitar noodling and their over-the-top yelling, I thought. How could anyone take that stuff seriously anymore?<br /><br />It doesn't help that Axl Rose is known as an epic goofball with a hall-of-fame ego. He's not the type of guy it's easy to feel respect or admiration for. At least not when all you know about him is his disastrous 2002 MTV thing.<br /><br />All I needed was a few paragraphs from John Jeremiah Sullivan's essay \\"The Final Comeback of Axl Rose\\" and then I was instantly re-introduced to G N' R, and, for the first time, utterly enthralled. I've pasted those paragraphs below, and then added a correction at the end.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I. From the beginning, he's been the only indispensable white male rock dancer of his generation, the only one worth imitating in mockery. I consider the moment in the \\"Patience\\" video when he does slow-motion snaky slide-foot dance while letting his hands float down as if they were feathers in an airless room--one fleeting near-pause in their descent for each note that Slash emphasizes in his transition to the coda--the greatest white male rock dance moment of the video age. What Axl does is lovely, I'm sorry.<br /><br />II. I've read all this stuff that said Nirvana made Guns N' Roses obsolete. But Guns N' Roses were never made obsolete. They just sort of disintegrated. Closer to the case is that G N' R made Nirvana possible. When you think about the niche that Nirvana supposedly created and perfected--a megaband that indie snobs couldn't entirely disavow, no matter how badly they wanted to--G N' R got there first. They didn't get all the way there, I realize. They dressed silly. They didn't seem to know the difference between their good songs and their crap songs. But we have to remember, too, how they came along at a time when bands with singers who looked like Axl and thrust their hips unironically, and lead players who spread their legs and reeled off guitar-god noodling weren't supposed to be interesting, melodically or culturally or in any other way. G N' R were. They were also grotesque and crass and stupid sometimes, even most of the time. Even almost all of the time. But you always knew you were seeing something when you saw them.<br /><br />III. I'm left listening to \\"Patience\\" again. And I whistle along and wait for that voice, toward the end, when he goes, Ooooooo, I need you. OOOOOOO, I need you. And on the fist Ooooooo, he finds a note so tissue-shredding it conjures the image of someone peeling his own scalp back, like the skin of a grape. I have to be careful not to attempt to sing along with this part, because it makes me, like, sort of throw up a little bit. And on the second OOOOOOO, you picture just a naked glowing green skull that hangs there vibrating gape-mouthed in a hyperbaric chamber. Or whatever it is you picture.<br /><br />IV. And after each line he is gazing at the crowd with those strangely startled yet fearless eyes, as though we had just surprised him in his den, tearing into some carrion.<br /><br />V. Axl has said, \\"I sing in five or six different voices that are all part of me. It's not contrived.\\" I agree. One of them is an unexpectedly competent baritone. The most important of the voices, though, is Devil Woman. Devil Woman comes from a deeper part of Axl than do any of the other voices. Often she will not enter until nearer the end of a song. In fact, the dramatic conflict between Devil Woman and her sweet, melodic yang--the Axl who sings such lines as \\"Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place\\" and \\"If you want to love me, then darling, don't refrain\\"--is precisely what resulted in Guns N' Roses' greatest songs. A lot of people will try to convince you that the band's street-tough image and attitude are what made them so massive. Of course, that's foolish.

B000000OSG|4.0|It's been years since I paid attention to 80's hard rock in anything other than an ironic way. Those goofy white guys in their jean shorts with their guitar noodling and their over-the-top yelling, I thought. How could anyone take that stuff seriously anymore?<br /><br />It doesn't help that Axl Rose is known as an epic goofball with a hall-of-fame ego. He's not the type of guy it's easy to feel respect or admiration for. At least not when all you know about him is his disastrous 2002 MTV thing.<br /><br />All I needed was a few paragraphs from John Jeremiah Sullivan's essay \\"The Final Comeback of Axl Rose\\" and then I was instantly re-introduced to G N' R, and, for the first time, utterly enthralled. I've pasted those paragraphs below, and then added a correction at the end.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I. From the beginning, he's been the only indispensable white male rock dancer of his generation, the only one worth imitating in mockery. I consider the moment in the \\"Patience\\" video when he does slow-motion snaky slide-foot dance while letting his hands float down as if they were feathers in an airless room--one fleeting near-pause in their descent for each note that Slash emphasizes in his transition to the coda--the greatest white male rock dance moment of the video age. What Axl does is lovely, I'm sorry.<br /><br />II. I've read all this stuff that said Nirvana made Guns N' Roses obsolete. But Guns N' Roses were never made obsolete. They just sort of disintegrated. Closer to the case is that G N' R made Nirvana possible. When you think about the niche that Nirvana supposedly created and perfected--a megaband that indie snobs couldn't entirely disavow, no matter how badly they wanted to--G N' R got there first. They didn't get all the way there, I realize. They dressed silly. They didn't seem to know the difference between their good songs and their crap songs. But we have to remember, too, how they came along at a time when bands with singers who looked like Axl and thrust their hips unironically, and lead players who spread their legs and reeled off guitar-god noodling weren't supposed to be interesting, melodically or culturally or in any other way. G N' R were. They were also grotesque and crass and stupid sometimes, even most of the time. Even almost all of the time. But you always knew you were seeing something when you saw them.<br /><br />III. I'm left listening to \\"Patience\\" again. And I whistle along and wait for that voice, toward the end, when he goes, Ooooooo, I need you. OOOOOOO, I need you. And on the fist Ooooooo, he finds a note so tissue-shredding it conjures the image of someone peeling his own scalp back, like the skin of a grape. I have to be careful not to attempt to sing along with this part, because it makes me, like, sort of throw up a little bit. And on the second OOOOOOO, you picture just a naked glowing green skull that hangs there vibrating gape-mouthed in a hyperbaric chamber. Or whatever it is you picture.<br /><br />IV. And after each line he is gazing at the crowd with those strangely startled yet fearless eyes, as though we had just surprised him in his den, tearing into some carrion.<br /><br />V. Axl has said, \\"I sing in five or six different voices that are all part of me. It's not contrived.\\" I agree. One of them is an unexpectedly competent baritone. The most important of the voices, though, is Devil Woman. Devil Woman comes from a deeper part of Axl than do any of the other voices. Often she will not enter until nearer the end of a song. In fact, the dramatic conflict between Devil Woman and her sweet, melodic yang--the Axl who sings such lines as \\"Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place\\" and \\"If you want to love me, then darling, don't refrain\\"--is precisely what resulted in Guns N' Roses' greatest songs. A lot of people will try to convince you that the band's street-tough image and attitude are what made them so massive. Of course, that's foolish.

I hadn't. \\"Sweet Child,\\" \\"Paradise City,\\" \\"November Rain,\\" \\"Patience,\\" they all come down to codas--Axl was a poet of the dark, unresolved coda--and to what do these codas themselves come down?

Oh, won't you please take me home?<br /><br />---<br /><br />The thing thatI think the essay gets wrong is painting G N' R as \\"crass and grotesque and stupid.\\" Try YouTubing some interviews with Axl. I think you'll be surprised by how articulate and thoughtful and even moral he is. True, he did some crass and grotesque and stupid things, but this clearly wasn't a guy who was just mindlessly spewing angry noise.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I get on the game and I cant even play . I tried loging out and back in but it didn't work.
B000000OQF|5.0|It's been years since I paid attention to 80's hard rock in anything other than an ironic way. Those goofy white guys in their jean shorts with their guitar noodling and their over-the-top yelling, I thought. How could anyone take that stuff seriously anymore?<br /><br />It doesn't help that Axl Rose is known as an epic goofball with a hall-of-fame ego. He's not the type of guy it's easy to feel respect or admiration for. At least not when all you know about him is his disastrous 2002 MTV thing.<br /><br />All I needed was a few paragraphs from John Jeremiah Sullivan's essay \\"The Final Comeback of Axl Rose\\" and then I was instantly re-introduced to G N' R, and, for the first time, utterly enthralled. I've pasted those paragraphs below, and then added a correction at the end.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I.  From the beginning, he's been the only indispensable white male rock dancer of his generation, the only one worth imitating in mockery. I consider the moment in the \\"Patience\\" video when he does slow-motion snaky slide-foot dance while letting his hands float down as if they were feathers in an airless room--one fleeting near-pause in their descent for each note that Slash emphasizes in his transition to the coda--the greatest white male rock dance moment of the video age. What Axl does is lovely, I'm sorry.<br /><br />II.  I've read all this stuff that said Nirvana made Guns N' Roses obsolete. But Guns N' Roses were never made obsolete. They just sort of disintegrated. Closer to the case is that G N' R made Nirvana possible. When you think about the niche that Nirvana supposedly created and perfected--a megaband that indie snobs couldn't entirely disavow, no matter how badly they wanted to--G N' R got there first. They didn't get all the way there, I realize. They dressed silly. They didn't seem to know the difference between their good songs and their crap songs. But we have to remember, too, how they came along at a time when bands with singers who looked like Axl and thrust their hips unironically, and lead players who spread their legs and reeled off guitar-god noodling weren't supposed to be interesting, melodically or culturally or in any other way. G N' R were. They were also grotesque and crass and stupid sometimes, even most of the time. Even almost all of the time. But you always knew you were seeing something when you saw them.<br /><br />III.  I'm left listening to \\"Patience\\" again. And I whistle along and wait for that voice, toward the end, when he goes, Ooooooo, I need you. OOOOOOO, I need you. And on the fist Ooooooo, he finds a note so tissue-shredding it conjures the image of someone peeling his own scalp back, like the skin of a grape. I have to be careful not to attempt to sing along with this part, because it makes me, like, sort of throw up a little bit. And on the second OOOOOOO, you picture just a naked glowing green skull that hangs there vibrating gape-mouthed in a hyperbaric chamber. Or whatever it is you picture.<br /><br />IV.  And after each line he is gazing at the crowd with those strangely startled yet fearless eyes, as though we had just surprised him in his den, tearing into some carrion.<br /><br />V.  Axl has said, \\"I sing in five or six different voices that are all part of me. It's not contrived.\\" I agree. One of them is an unexpectedly competent baritone. The most important of the voices, though, is Devil Woman. Devil Woman comes from a deeper part of Axl than do any of the other voices. Often she will not enter until nearer the end of a song. In fact, the dramatic conflict between Devil Woman and her sweet, melodic yang--the Axl who sings such lines as \\"Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place\\" and \\"If you want to love me, then darling, don't refrain\\"--is precisely what resulted in Guns N' Roses' greatest songs. A lot of people will try to convince you that the band's street-tough image and attitude are what made them so massive. Of course, that's foolish. The \\"media\\" adore street-tough image and attitude and, via a curious circular maneuver, will frequently work to convince you that street-tough image and attitude are the reason you love some band, but you, the people of the world, tend to buy 15 million copies of a debut album because it's chockablock with hits. G N' R wrote four or five untouchable pop songs, and that's why we're still talking about them--that's why the mere fact of Axl's mounting a comeback was newsworthy.<br /><br />Take \\"Sweet Child o' Mine,\\" which, in my unassuming view, shares with the Wrens' \\"I've Made Enough Friends\\" the distinction of being the most perfectly achieved rock 'n' roll song of the past twenty years. It's not that you don't love it from the beginning, what with the killer riffs and the oddly antiquated-sounding chorus, yet a sword hangs over it. You think: This can't be everything. Come on--I mean, \\"Now and then when I see her face / It takes me away to that special place\\"? Then, around 5:04, she arrives. The song has veered minor-key by then, the clouds have begun to gather, and I never hear that awesome, intelligent solo that I don't imagine Axl's gone off somewhere at the start of it, to be by himself while his body undergoes certain changes. What I love is how when he comes back in, he comes in on top of himself (\\"five or six different voices that are all part of me\\"); he's not yet all the way finished with I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I when that fearsome timbre tears itself open.

B006Z7Z3S6|1.0|The Innkeepers offers a low-rent riff on The Shining. There's no isolation to bump the suspense- the characters can leave the spooky hotel any time they want. The characters are two-dimensional. There is little originality, wit or development here. Just another by-the-numbers collection of set pieces that have been copied over and over by various hacks. Skip it.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is a bit challenging but very addictive its even better if you are not easly motion sick some times its hard because there is more than one thing to jump nut over all a fun game
B008ASLK8A|1.0|This was just a waste of time. A big yawn. The whimsical factor is what made it SO bad. The only good part was the choice of the villan. I do not like movies where they try to make a joke and its obvious thAt they are trying too hard to do it. Time is precious,Don't waste it on this.
0785162348|5.0|This book I found very informative as far as the character backgrounds are concerned. Lots of illustrations. The slip case is another nice feature making it feel like a collectors item.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun. I play for hours. I just cant stand losing do I keep trying and get it. its a nice way to kill time.
B007SGM084|5.0|very captivating and entertaining piece of fiction. Her play with words is absolutely phenomenal. I urge Men to also read this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't sure about reading 50 Shades of Grey after reading a couple of reviews, but after my niece said she read all 3 books and they were really good, I read them. I wasn't disappointed. Yes there's sex, but as the characters develope, you understand why Christian is the way he is and the dynamics between the two main characters. I wish there was a 4th book!
0307352145|2.0|The book offers some great insights and research for some of its claims, but the research was often overly simplified or one-sided and drew overarching conclusions. One example is of her discussion of the amygdala and how it is the basically the core of your \\"flight or fight\\" response to dangerous or uncomfortable stimuli. Not once does she even mention the words sympathetic nervous system which in fact is the network of nerves that regulates your flight or fight response. She writes something like 'when a frisbee is headed toward you or snake is hissing at you it's your amygdala which tells you to run.' Not true! Yes, it is purported that the amygdala is the emotional center of your brain, but your amygdala is not in any way involved in these reflex responses. These stimuli do not go through your amygdala but pass to your sympathetic nervous system which terminates in the adrenal glands which release adrenaline. However, if you do have an emotional (not reflex) response to a certain stimuli that makes you nervous or uncomfortable it may pass through your amygdala and onto your sympathetic nervous system which then releases adrenaline and makes you even more uncomfortable. This criticism to some may seem as though it's missing the point, but to me it shows that she makes claims based on research that she can't even correctly explain herself. There is a vast difference between an emotional response to a stimuli and reflex to a object moving toward your head.<br /><br />Another example when she talks about how groups may sap the creativity of individuals, she focuses entirely on only that side. At the end of the chapter she offers a couple of paragraphs on how groups may actually be beneficial in her cafe example, but she fails to give due credit to the fact that being in groups engenders the exchange of ideas and may sprout innovation.<br /><br />In the chapter the temperament destiny she almost completely bases all of her conclusions on Kagan's study and presents itas gospel as if there are no competing theories. In her author's description its says she went to Princeton and Harvard Law, but it is pretty clear that she is not an academic and oversimplifies research and draws heavy conclusions. With that being said, the book exposed me to new ideas and piqued my interest.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|no complaints here! A really simple yet enjoyable game and the best part is it's free! I have become addicted to making my restaurant awesome :)
B002RKSXJG|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and it wasn't a short book.  The characters in this mid-1800's mystery gave me an insight as to what living in England during that time period must have been like.  I loved the mystery, too.  As a side note, the manservant's love of the book Robinson Crusoe motivated me to read that book next.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run!!!  it is so fun!!!  I love the store. because we can get different people!  totaley WICKED!!!!
B000JQTWPO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book while recovering from my surgery.  It was a quick read even though not a short book.  All of the characters in the book were interesting.
0060527986|5.0|Without repeating what everyone has already said, those who know there's more to life yet humble to understand their (our)own human nature will find this book infinitely useful. Especially through hard and 'doubt' filled dark times, if one chooses, you can open it up at 'random' seeking some answers to the specific moment or question at hand - and if you truly believe you'll get exactly what you need to 'keep going'. This book will never get old and you will never put it away. It will feel every time as if it was the first time you read it, even if you had for years.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so fun I am so addicted to it and its so hard but challenging for me best game ever!!!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I've read a lot of reviews, and I gotta say I disagree some of them. I like this album. All of it! Some parts more than others of course. The last three songs a chock full of Brian genius. Take it for what it is: a fun, easy, and mellow listen. Just what Brian said he wanted to make. Pure and simple: it's a good BB album with a bunch of awesome flavors to it. Don't be hatin', just try it. Also, try not to judge the beachy  tracks. They ARE the BEACH Boys after all....they've proven they're more than that, but it did all start with \\"surfin' \\".
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great it was so fun and adventurous I was so addicted to it I played it all day and night
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I thought this was too expensive but couldn't find any others that did quite what i wanted so i got it. It fits like a glove and does indeed protect my kindle so works as advertised (note, i think the price has come down since i bought it)
B005FDWIGQ|5.0|I LOVED this season, best season yet. BUT I hope Skyler is the next main character Walt kills. I cannot stand her whining and questioning him. Besides sleeping with her boss and giving him a large chunk of change (albeit there was some awesome funny in there though) she only aggrivates me.
B0037YOMWS|5.0|having been a user of HP calculators 3 decades ago, acquiring this product recently allowed me to re experience HP's excellent financial computing products, and RPN. I did need to read the manual carefully, which I felt could be better written.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game.  all the games are addictive. you keep thinking one more try and I know I can do better.
0345803485|5.0|The book includes all the hyped erotica but the storyline and characters will steal your heart. I am almost done with book 3 but keep stalling because I don't want it to end!
0345803485|2.0|I'm sorry but is it possible for someone to write a book, movie or tv program that in some small way reflects REAL Life...Everyone in this book is beautiful, rich, smart, well educated, well endowed, with an excellent job, family & IQ...So not true ... in my world at least...I'm surrounded by idiots with low paying jobs, credit card debt, disfunctional families, IQ's below 70, gross obesity, health problems (mental as well as phyical) & less than beautiful bodies. It gives us all an inferiority complex to see & read about perfection. Make us feel good please.  Maybe we should write a book...
0439023521|5.0|Although this is aimed at the young adult market, I would recommend it for any age group.  Wonderfully entertaining and well written.
0307716546|3.0|The premise of \\"Afterwards\\" by Rosamund Lupton is similar to that of \\"The Lovely Bones\\":  a dead  (or nearly dead) person communicates with others in an attempt to uncover a crime.  In the case of \\"Afterwards,\\" the crime is arson, and the beginning of the book is well done--fast-paced, interesting, and  engaging.  The main character rushes into a burning school to save her teenaged daughter.  Both mother and daughter are severely injured in the fire, and their spirits communicate with one another as they  lie in comas in the local hospital.  Then minor characters (father, son) become involved as Mom tries to discover who set the fire and why.<br /><br />After this superb beginning, this novel simply bogs down.  It is too long in the middle, and there is far too much psychological analysis for my taste. Of course the reader wants to know underlying complexity of motivation, but too much is too much.  Mother and daughter communicate, and parts of this section are confusing.  It is occasionally difficult to know who is speaking.  Mom finds out things she never knew about her family--surprise, surprise--and the incredible and undying love of a mother for her child is repeatedly reinforced.<br /><br />In the end, the reader discovers who set the fire, and the answer is very unexpected. There are any number of likely suspects, and the motivations of each are explored, but most readers will not guess the identity of the arsonist.<br /><br />To sum up, this was a good story, but not great.  I notice that many other reviewers have mentioned Lupton's other book, \\"Sister.\\"  I plan to read this book to see if I can get a better handle on her storytelling.  For now, count me in the ambivalent category.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Cant play because it keeps loading, loading, loading! It worked the first day but now it wont load on my phone or kindle fire, ugh!
0345803485|3.0|I almost didn't buy it once I heard it was a hit with twilight fans and I run away from anything that cheesy. However I love erotica so I decided to give it a chance. I actually really liked the story although I agree the writer is repetitive. My biggest complaint is that I really wish Christian could be dark mysterious and into BDSM without having a tormented childhood. It sends the message that anyone who likes kinky sex is screwed up and frankly that's just not true
B007I2BZIE|5.0|What strikes me most about this album is its lack of nervous playing.  I love Rush's music, but there was always a sense that they were trying to prove themselves (to us? each other? the world?).  With this album, they seemed to have finally arrived at a well-deserved level of confidence in their skills, one that comes across both in their performance and song writing.  Particularly with respect to the latter, all of these tunes sound as if there was concerted effort to place their considerable chops at the service of \\"the song.\\"  No one member outshines the other; each is working together, and with each other, to create the best tune possible.  This combination of confidence, incredible playing, teamwork, and humility makes this a very special album.  What a joy it is to hear the potential in one's favorite band be realized.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I absolutely love this game...lots of improvements...only problem is no neighbors...other than that it plays well n I love building up my town...energy refills fast n so do crops n inventory items...ty
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome book..kept me reading for days, downloading is easy, Amazon makes it fun to buy.  Do wish there were more free titles
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|The characters lack depth, background, convincing motivation, or anything that would make me identify with them or care about them.<br /><br />The plot has holes, and doesn't take the series as a whole anywhere. As example, the Engineers give all humans a map to the moon on which the plot happens, so one would expect it to be an important place, like the Engineers' home world, but turns out it's just the kind of deserted faraway place where one would hold an extremely dangerous bio-weapon. The atmosphere there isn't even breathable by Engineers, and they've had to create an artificial atmosphere in their facilities.<br /><br />It is unclear why David infects Holloway with the black substance. If it's because Weyland wants to accelerate his plans, it is unclear why would anyone think the black material would extend anyone's life or speed up the meeting with the Engineers.<br /><br />Sure, those questions could be answered, and the answers might have even been cut out in editing, but that brings up another point - the movie doesn't add anything to the other movies. The questions of where humans & the Aliens came from was never important in the other movies, just like the question where the Predators race came from.<br /><br />If the movie wasn't part of the Alien brand, it would probably never reach the movie theaters.
0307951529|5.0|I've recommended this book to everyone I know who isn't doing what they love.  This book will never leave my sight.  Very well done, Chris.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I haven't had any problems with this! its great and you can edit photos and post pics on the website, facebook, any website!! you also can email or send them via text message...I have the texting app for kindle fire. :) its just great and I have over 40 people following me! yay! :)
B00846REIS|4.0|While a lot is being said / written about 50 shades of grey, this book (although similar to 50 shades) was a much much better version. The hero was more likeable, the heroine less of a doormat and the story more gripping. Can' wait for the 2nd book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow... I can see why this was such a run-away hit.<br /><br />It's one of the most refreshing looks at the post-apocalyptic genre I've seen in a while. It's also deeply, deeply cynical... a winning combination as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />The world of the silo is richly detailed and it all just checks out. Howey obviously put a lot of thought into putting this world together and it just makes it feel very real. You can easily imagine yourself living in the Silo.<br /><br />Great read, much recommended to any sci-fi fans.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|excellent game for those of us with brains and like to use them.<br />solve well designed logic puzzles in this game.
B005FITIF0|4.0|I am a huge Gerard (Jerry) Butler fan and have loved him since Phantom of the Opera!  In Machine Gun Preacher he plays Sam, a rough and tumble criminal who is hooked on drugs and upon getting out of jail finds out his wife has found God! She goes to church and supports him no matter what kind of trouble he gets in. I spent half the movie wondering if she was completely in love with him or just dumb. They say that behind every good man is a great woman and her constant support brings him to church where he finds the strength to finally turn his life around. He is Mr. Upstanding citizen helping others and suddenly running to East Africa to help rebuild.  Before you know it he has taken children in and all the kids know him. He comes home and builds a church and travels back to Africa to fight against Joseph Kony's slaughtering army.<br /><br />Jerry does a great job as usual but like I said, I am a big fan. The story is interesting and at times horrifying even more so knowing it is a true story.  If all it does is entertain that will be the minimum. Hopefully it will draw more to know and hopefully fight against the onslaught of humanity going on around the world. So much innocence lost. But if nothing else, this film shows that we should never give up on anyone because everyone can turn their life around if they choose to.
B002UXRGM0|1.0|I'm sure this series is a wonderful set. I just can't watch it on my PS3 Slim which was manufactured in Sept. 2011. Any of the discs I try result in the initial video playing then the BBC logo coming up then a blank screen. The player refuses to play it. I have read that this series is 1080p/50 which USDM PS3's can't play. Very dissapointed, especially as some reviews mentioned that \\"newer\\" PS3's should have no problem with playback.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|The reason its not free on the kindle is because we &quot;ONLY&quot; PAID $199 which was below cost of actually making it! Amazon already put that out before &quot;you&quot; even bought it!  And paid apps was going to recoup some of the costs and profits! Get a grip man!!! Angry Birds is definitely one of those worth paying for!
0061900656|1.0|We bought this book for our nephew's older son when his baby brother was born.  The book is adorable, but the price on the back looks like a label that can be peeled off - it's not!  Who wants to give a gift with the price tag on it.  How very disappointing!  We kept it at our house and gave him another gift.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|At first I thought what can all the fuss be about, so I bought Fifty,<br />Well now i know.<br />What a story.<br />Some have been known to say Twilight with spank,<br />Its soooo much more than that.<br />Here is love story to rival the best of them.<br />Once you've read Fifty Shades of Grey make sure you have Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed.
0545123275|5.0|I won this book from Goodreads First Reads giveaways in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I just finished the book, and I'm speechless. I've seen Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater on the bookshelves at the library and in spots in random places, but for some reason never picked it up. I am so thankful that I won this book so that I had the chance to read it. It is primarily the love story between Grace, a human girl with senses like a wolf, and Sam, a werewolf. The romance is tender, beautiful and moving. The prose is magical-- drifting in and out like poetry. The beauty of her words reminds me a bit of Lauren Oliver, my current favorite YA author. The plot arc manifests itself at a perfect pace, and we see bits and pieces of what is to come while never sacrificing character development.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful-- Grace and Sam are both incredibly likeable. I feel like the girl working in the candy shop who tells them never to change-- that there is something wonderful about love at first sight. But to me, the hero is Isabel, my favorite character. She inserts a bit of bright rationality and humor, allowing us to relax from the increased panic and sadness of the other characters. One question that I had for the first half of the book (\\"So why don't these wolves just move to Florida if cold makes them change?\\") was asked in basically the same tone by Isabel. In my secret heart of hearts, I think of her as Stiefvater's beta reader that was inserted into the pages to answer questions that the other characters don't even think to ask.<br /><br />Overall, a terrific, wonderful and beautiful novel. I will definitely be picking up the other ones, although I love how this one ends.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I have been enraptured with Ed Sheeran's music for about a year now and I have been waiting anxiously for this album to comes to the States and immediately purchased it as soon as it was available. At first I was afraid that I built his album up in my head due to my excitement but after listening to it several times, I can safely say that \\"+\\" is truly an incredible work of art!<br /><br />There is a healthy mix of ballads and faster songs, so you never feel like the album is too slow or too fast and there is a wonderful simplicity to how he forms his music and builds it up with his lyrics and beats. I really appreciate the lyrical content and the meanings behind all of his songs.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this album enough to everyone, please if you're not sure about it just take a small leap of faith and buy it, you will not be disappointed!
0345522303|5.0|I like this series, and I think you have to read them all to truly enjoy it. Be prepared for a little creepiness in this installment, but overall it was less creepy/gory than Stalking Darkness or Shadows Return. The romantic relationship between to the two main male characters is now pretty matter-of-fact, both personally for the characters and socially in this fantasy setting-- it might be good to know that before buying, whether you were looking specifically for m/m romance or would rather avoid it.<br /><br />The plots specific to this book resolve very satisfyingly, and (this is a trick I really appreciate) there are still questions from the \\"big picture\\" of the series to resolve. What is the matter with Seregil's magic? And this earlier magic - made with a musical instrument - what will that reveal?<br />Overall, this is a great world to visit, and this particular book had a slight vampirish atmosphere, a double dose of setting, or in other words, double bang for your fantasy buck.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think one of the best things about this game is that you don't even have to be good at it to really enjoy it. No matter what you will build up coins and you will have fun. A definite winner!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! There were a few things that annoyed me, but overall, very well written and a great love story. The sex parts were a bit tame for my normal reading, but in general,very worth the $$ and time!
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|I will have to read the book because there wasn't enough information provided about the characters' histories(poor character development).  I normally like a good underdog story or good vs evil, but the script writers must have assumed that all the movie goers had read the book and memorized all of the import details that were left out of the movie.  At one point in the movie female lead says \\"I know you John Carter\\" and describes his character with a level of detail that was completely absent from the script.  There is NO way she could have known him from what I saw on the screen.<br /><br />I am not a fan of this movie!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|As good as the fisrst book! Easy to read , the story has minor differences from season 2 of the TV SHOW.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|One minute you are thinking, &#34;how interesting can a 1941 courier drop in New Mexico be?&#34; and the next you are thinking, &#34;this is the most compelling narrative I've ever read!&#34;  I cannot believe it took me this long to discover this great author!<br />SteveO, Bristol RI USA
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster took me by surprise!  Was recommended by a friend after completing the 50 Shades trilogy.<br />I found myself longing for more of Abby and Travis' story well after I had finished the book.<br />This novel was much easier for me to wrap my head around. I literally found myself tearing up at the closeness I felt to the ups and downs the characters went through.<br />Such a great love story and I wish this was a trilogy!!!
0345803507|5.0|If you like reading  (and are an adult!) this is a fast read!  Books came quickly and arrived in perfect shape. These books are definately a must! Not recommened for kids.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Addicted! I love playing this on my Kindle Fire. Even my 4 yr old plays and laughs when the zombies eat her brains...
B007SGM084|1.0|R.L. Stine writes better than this author. This whole series is a waste of time and I am hard pressed to figure out why anyone thinks this is worth reading.<br /><br />I don't object to the topic. It's just not a well written series. Buy Story of O instead.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|My son downloaded this movie, we watched it several times till I got alerts to how much of my internet time was being taken streaming it.  So we bought it on dvd and we also got ironman 2.
B0015UKX7Y|4.0|It reminds me of the Righteous Brothers, just a bit. Okay, they're not quite there, but some of the songs hit violin-swollen peaks of emotion that leave you wanting more, that leave you remembering songs you haven't thought about since the 1960s--and about how those songs left you with a promise of emotional ecstasy that has yet to be fulfilled. Some of the songs come across as stylized bachelor pad pieces--cool for bachelor pads, or cafes, or inevitably by coolness-co-opting mall stores, but not for serious listening. A couple of the songs do little. Yet there is more than enough here to suggest that this band could go further. When the Starbucks track rotation feeling dissipates, and the band endeavors to create something more thematically coherent and powerful--something that proceeds from, say, melancholy city life to break-up in the melancholy city, rather than, say, from Dr. Zhivago to James Bond--the band will be serious contenders for track rotation at my no-longer bachelor pad. I really dig this effort musically, lyrically, stylistically, but I hope they will push themselves harder to create something more than just a collection of 3:13 minute semi-statements: an overarching statement with thoughts and feelings that coalesce into a statement on life that will be begged to be listened to, analyzed, appreciated, and experienced over and over again.
0345803493|1.0|Gosh, this is terrible. This is like a cd left on repeat (a really annoying one at that)  playing the same songs over and over and over.<br /><br />This is what everyone is so pumped about?  Thank goodness I didn't waste any money on it since it was a library e-book.
B00881VLCE|5.0|awesome and never dull on epics or puzzles even has a store to buy more puzzle there are free ones too of course just like the ipad version
B004QXJZXA|4.0|Excellent \\"Steve McQueen movie.\\"  If you are looking for a lot dialogue, this is not it.  If you want subtle acting, fast cars and a realistic storyline, this ones for you.  It has held up well since being made.<br /><br />The video and audio are very good.  You will be pleased.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I don't know if I want to get this app yet. I don't have the money. but if u guys say its really good then I might get it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great calculator. so easy to use! it opens full screen and is fully functional. I would like to see a scientific version!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Works perfectly, easy to add new events, syncs multiple calendars and pretty customizable. Haven't found anything better and don't feel the need to look
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have the Joyce Meyer daily devotional which is wonderful! It related to my life while allowing me to come closer to God through different passages it recommends. If you have a busy schedule this would be perfect for you. It really implants the message in your mind so daily when you have certain thoughts or decisions to make you think about God's word!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Like her earlier work Dark Places I found this book engrossing and clever and while Gone Girl lacked some of the emotional cadence of Dark Places it more than compensated with its fast pace, dark humour and sparkling narrative. Sometimes Flynn seems to try a little too hard to be clever with her language (example is her repeated use of the word lilt: \\"She said these last words in a childish lilt that I once found fetching,\\" \\"...and I felt my stomach lilt,\\" \\"As Long as He Needs Me\\" is basically a lilting paean to domestic violence,\\" \\"And yet I feel a lilt of nerves,\\". I found this a little grating but not nearly enough to stop me from marveling at the cleverness of the plot and the exhilarating pace of the story line. Plus I just loved the dark commentary on love and marriage, co-dependance, hipster culture, and society's obsession with looks. It worked on all these levels or just as a delicious and sinister fable about what can happen when you are dishonest with yourself and your loved ones.<br /><br />Read it in two nights and will recommend to all and sundry.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cord on my Kindle 2 had frayed, exposing wires, so it was definitely time for a new one. Because this is made by an outside vendor, I called Amazon to ask about it. Amazon supplied this cord to me for free, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the cord is longer than the one it replaced, making it much easier for me to charge. I'm not sure, but it SEEMS that my Kindle charges faster with this cord.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like that as soon as I turn on the fire I can get the temperature and humidity level, helping a lot this summer.
B00005QHV5|5.0|Gunter Wand seemed like sound quality guaranty. I own his Beethoven, Brahms, and Bruckner complete symphonies. All are excellent on sound. NDR (and Cologne Radio) maybe not world's top 10 but definitely first class orchestras. I am an amateur listener so don't go deep such as which Beethoven version Wand used. I only want clear and sharp sound quality and a heavy German-Austrian symphonic. This cycle has all of them with a little bit faster tempo.<br /><br />I have 15 sets of Beethoven's cycle. I list them down here with my VERY MUCH subjective viewpoint (sometimes I skip symphony 1 and 2).<br /><br />1. Gunter Wand/NDR - very clear sound, very much recommend<br />2. Kurt Masur/Gewandhaus (198x) - even better, like a Rock&Roll, very much recommend<br />3. Haitink/Concertgebouw - clear and smooth, very much recommend<br />4. Karajan/BPO (1963) - top sound (who was the recording engineer?), very much recommend<br />5. Solti/Chicago - very good symphonic, nice recording, very recommend<br />6. Dohnanyi/Cleveland - little different from German orchestras but still recommend<br />7. Muti/Philadephia - ok record, recommend<br />8. Colin Davis/Staatskapelle Dresden - good, little slow, recommend<br />9. Karl Bohm/VPO - Very typical German-Austrian sound, little slow, recommend<br />10. Kurt Masur/Gewandhaus (197x) - not as good as his 198x<br />11. Karajan/BPO (198x) - the recording engineer somewhat destroyed it, not comparable to the 1963<br />12. Blomstedt/Staatskapelle Dresden - sound is not very good, little bit slow<br />13. Abbado/BPO - a strange translation with too fast pace, probably due to the version he used<br />14. David Zinman/Tonhalle - This cycle is highly rated here but to me, it's more like played by a chamber orchestra, overly fast tempo, with sound quality distance from Karajan's 1963 or Gunter Wand.<br />15. Janos Ferencsik/Hngarian Nat'l - Sound quality is not as good, price is not that low, I don't know why it's rated high here.<br /><br />Once again, these are my very own opinion. I only care sound quality (I have Furtwangler's 9th but only listened 1 or 2 times). Gunter Wand and the 1963 Karajan are both low priced but with very high quality of sound. $56 buy them both and enjoy for more than 10 hours!!
B000V1Z8KK|3.0|I decided to watch the movie on a whim, ended up being exhausted by some poor dialogue and lack-luster action. I rate the movie a 3 out of 5 simply because I think Wahlberg did a good job with what he had to work with on this movie. Pena was just awful, playing the nervous, smart, new-guy in a movie has seen better days.<br /><br />The plot couldn't have been more standard, I would have hoped for more. It's a good film if you aren't looking for something complicated and I would recommend it to anyone interested in guns/shooting.
B008764ZQ4|1.0|... was this ever a bad movie! Sorry but I had to say it. Maybe the worst movie so far this year. Soundtrack is okay considering.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Many new twists and turns. This season was even better than the awesome first season. Highly recommended and be prepared to become addicted.
6305807930|4.0|Dario Argento, director of \\"Inferno\\" has compared his film to watching a nightmare.  The film certainly is very dream-like with very stylish and haunting images.  Plus, there is a distinct lack of logic to the film.  The plot does not make much sense and seems to be built around a series of lengthy and cool murder set pieces.  The ending is rather abrupt and anti-climactic.  The film is definitely an exercise in style over substance.  Still, the movie looks great and contains many very haunting images and murders.  Worth watching once but I don't think I will ever revisit this film in the future.  I love a film with a good plot.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|To begin, this is not my typical topic of book to read. Im generally an odd mix of spiritual and murder mystery novels. With that being said, I loved all three of the books. I saw the movie previous to reading the books, and was shocked at the amount of detail left out of the movie. Then again, a person can only sit so long! :-) The books were 10 times better than the movie itself. A lot of people complete that the last book \\"lacks something\\", but I think because the 1st two are so power packed, the third can seem rather mild in content.<br /><br />I would and have suggested this book to friends and family of all ages and cultures! Great Read!
B007H9B6KA|4.0|Garbage has been MIA since they finished their tour supporting \\"Bleed Like Me\\" in 2005.  Seven long years.  Finally, they release a new album.  Its been so long ... is it any good?  Its not my favorite Garbage album but it is certainly a good one.  There is not a weak link on this album.  All of the songs feature the classic Garbage sound.  When you hear them, you will know what I mean.  Its not like a lot of reunion albums by some artists that sound like they were recording by a totally different band.  This album fits like a glove for Garbage fans and that should be enough to convince them to buy this new album.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I cannot say how much my kids LOVE this book.  They giggle and giggle.  They will act out the scenes. so funny.
B004GYY714|3.0|There are lots of glowing reviews for the good things this software does, so I will post the main reason for my three star review:<br /><br />The TuneIn Radio software does not shut down properly.<br /><br />Regardless of whether I click the \\"back\\" button on my Droid Charge (which ends most applications), or press Exit in the TuneIn Radio menu, the program remains running in the background, consuming precious battery power. I am forced to fire up a task manager to kill the application.<br /><br />The other incredibly frustrating issue with the program is that, even after I have used a task manager to forcefully kill the app., the app. occasionally restarts itself in the background.<br /><br />Fix those two issues and it's a five star application.
1401232590|4.0|I got a case of nostalgia after playing Arkham City and decided to get into a few graphic novels.  I chose this one based on its high rating on many people's list of favorite Batman stories.  I enjoyed it and would suggest it for anybody looking for a good Batman read.  Many villains, an enticing story, and a well thought-out mystery combine in this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this is the best book i have ever read it has so much detial but still not to much to make you bored. i strongly recomend this book to any kind of reader and cant wait to read the second one, i cryed and rejoyed throught the whole book, and it felt as if i was in the book,about the book, in the ruins of a place known as North America lies the nation of panem a shining capital surounded by twelve outlying districts, the capital is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them to all send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual  Hunger Games, a fight to death on live TV, sixteen year old Katness Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sisters place in the Games. but Katness has been close to death before - and survival, for her,is second nature. whithout really meaning to, she becomes a contender. but if shes is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. this is by ffffaaaaarrrrr my fav book and all my freinds can say the same i would like to thank mrs Suzanne Collins for doing what she has done i cant wait to read more from her you are my fav author and you will always be THANK YOU
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I bought this over the black friday amazon deals. It was a great gift and only $8! Such a steal, and I didn't have to wait in any lines! We loved the movie and watched it the day after christmas! (And I'm not a fan of animations/cartoons!)

0345529057|5.0|I purchased this set for my daughter and soin-law. We are series fans but they also wanted to read the books because there is always so much more to them than can be presented on TV. They were thrilled to get them.

B000BDJ1PG|5.0|I never understand american record labels sometimes.  This is like an epitamy of an album.  Great songs, great artist.  No one like Madonna.  If you listen to the american release of, \\"Like A Prayer\\"., it's missing volume on it.<br />This japanese release has better sound almost remastered but not quite, but still happy that it has better loud sound then the american version.<br /><br />Madonna is an artist that you don't compromise the sound on.  Specially, \\"Like A Prayer\\".  Love all the songs on here especially, \\"Til Death Do Us Part, Keep It Together, Express Yourself, Oh Father, Dear Jesse, Cherish, too many great songs on here.\\"  Madonna doesn't have the voice, she has true artistry and it's good enough when you belt out songs with passion in your voice and what God brought you on this earth with.<br /><br />I love you Madonna always will.  The better-sounding quality \\"Like A Prayer\\", is pricey but Madonna is worth every penny.  I think I paid $36 bucks for this import.  I'm so happy with it.  Until Warner Bros. brings our the true Remastered, \\"Like A Prayer\\", this will do just fine for me.<br /><br />I hope you all buy the import, but be careful if you get it used, you never know it may be the american version and not the import.  Don't be thrifty, buy the original with the hefty price.  I promise you won't be sorry.<br /><br />Thank you  I hope this helps you Die hard Madonna fans.<br /><br />Marco
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun enough to occupy the kids. They earn points and then pick a new game to open.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|The game itself is pretty good. The low rating is for the delay in getting updates for it on Amazon. The Play Store has had an update available for about 2 months now, but I can't use it because I bought here.
0393064476|4.0|I read it straight out and really enjoyed it. It is a fantastic writing indeed and very thought provoking. You should have a read. Plan to do nothing else though. You won't want to put it down.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app!! I love the fact that I can decide how difficult or easy each puzzle can be.
0345803485|5.0|I got this book to read also to read for very cold weather it seems very very good.  I've heard very good reviews about this. I plan on buying them all.  Thanks
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great easy read. I'm not usually one for a trashy romance-type novel, but this one got me hooked! Warning though, it will definitely make you blush - glad to be reading it from my kindle so other people can't see lol.  I will say that after reading all three, that each book gets better - the third one has a great storyline with a lot of action.
B0079XPUOW|1.0|WORST novel of Scalzi's EVER! I've read everything of his, and this is by far the worst (doesn't even seem like it was written by him). It's got a moronic story, which gets worse as you keep reading. It's full of \\"insider\\" references to his temporary gig in LA/Burbank recently, which has no meaning (other than proving he spent time in Burbank). The three \\"codas\\" are a complete waste of time, and a blatant attempt to try and turn a terrible schlocky amateurish novel into something \\"meaningful\\" and \\"thought provoking\\". DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS....and if you ignore my advice, and read it anyway, I will happily send you a note saying \\"told you so!\\"
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I had high expectations for The Avengers, and they were surpassed!  Joss Whedon was able to take an ensemble cast and give them all their due.  The action scenes are great and the actors play off one another excellently.<br /><br />You don't have to be familiar with the comics or even the other movies to appreciate it.  Although it does make for a richer experience.
034580404X|1.0|I'm sorry to say that as someone pushing 50 who has read a good amount of erotic books through her lifetime, I was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of this book.  It's truly written for young adults (18 - 22?) who probably should not even be reading this material to begin with at that early age!  I know the author tries to make it entertaining and simple to read and she succeeded - but the quality of the writing is so mediocre.  I can't understand all the accolades.  Her description of every single detail of what each character does is a waste of time.  From dropping a sock to the floor to how someone cocks their head.  I'm really not sure what I'm missing here. The subject of dominant and submissive affairs, admittedly, is not appealing to me however I've seen porn flicks on that subject matter that was more entertaining than this book.<br /><br />Try reading Interview with a Vampire by Anne Rice.  One of the most erotic books out there and there's not one bit of actual sex in it.  There's good writing....and try the Sleeping Beauty trilogy by the same author.  You'll wonder why you ever picked up 50 Shades of Grey....let alone waste your time on the trilogy.
0345803485|4.0|I found myself completely addicted, I loved the possessiveness of Christian. His need for Ana.<br /><br />Not going to lie however, I was extremely annoyed with Ana. I kept thinking how annoying she was and how she should just do what Christian was telling her to...<br /><br />Strangely erotic and potentially cause for concern that a possessive, bondage obsessed character was arousing... I'm judging myself right now..<br /><br />The writing was one of the worse I've seen, with the repetition of 'you look mighty fine' 'oh my' blah blah blah.. But the writer is a producer in life so that's where the poor writing comes from.<br /><br />A good quick read.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|I remember listening to \\"Gone Again\\" for the first time at dusk in a creekside park here in Dallas.  I was homeless.  Music was one of my few joys.  Since then, I've become an ardent fan.  Patti Smith is not only a fine songwriter with a strong melodic sense, but she's one of the few poets involved in music.  Leonard Cohen is the only other one I can think of, and his last one wasn't so strong.<br /><br />\\"Banga\\" is more melodious than \\"Trampin'\\", and has a strong pull to it.  I'd highly recommend this to those new to Patti Smith.<br /><br />If it's any consolation, I yelled PATTI SMITH! at a Dylan concert.  The people in front of me turned to look and then one shot a fist in the air.  She's not as well-known in Dallas as she is in the Pacific Northwest, but we love her just the same.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its a pretty neat and easy game that lets you create your own pioneer town that you run. it has its own successes and difficulties you have to overcome.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its nice to see the Irish have a video game hero. its a nice tip of the hat to a larger franchise.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addictive. it is fast paced &amp; a lot of fun. I told my daughter about it &amp; she is hooked too.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|Bought and now I can't redownload. Really love the app when I can use it. Widget is great and links to amazon mp3
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it keeps you fairly busy and is great if you're just trying to pass the time. great for younger kids and bored teens.
B005FLX2IQ|3.0|Was really excited to hear this cd but a little disappointed in the quality of it.  Sounded like an audience made recording vs. a true line tap, professionally edited concert.  Only 8 songs so is also kind of short.  Wondered where this came from since it is new to the Peter Gabriel library yet his own site does not have it for sale.  Overall the quality is ok, but unless your a collector of P. Gabriel's material look towards, \\"play's it live\\" or \\"secret world\\" for a better live experience.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B003K16P50|5.0|This book has been misconstrued by many reviewers as a political satire or dark comedy. It is, but I it is so much more. BTW, the movie was charming, but completely unrelated to the spirit and intent of the novel. The book is about the power of belief as a prerequisite to faith, and belief in the impossible so strong that the impossible must become true. Read it, you will like it. And a geek biologist is the hero!
B001684L0A|5.0|Taking a peek into history, or many peeks as in this case, can be full of surprises.  And why not?  It was a time of change.  The American Revolution was unique and still is so.  Revolutions of other nations have little or nothing in common with American history.<br /><br />The cinemaphotography is excellent in my opinion.  Characters have room to develop.  The music doesn't get in the way.<br /><br />It seems some commentors can find great faults.  Let them if that is all they can find.<br /><br />Can anyone look back in perfect accuracy in their own past?  Let alone the past of someone else.<br /><br />I'm not overly fond of the tilt camera angles.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|These are so fun to solve, I find I can't put the game down. There are a ton of puzzles and several different experience categories.
1582701709|1.0|It's one thing to have a postive attitude, won't argue with that.  This book and its chrony idea just radiate your thoughts to the universe and you become the beacon to have all your wishes fullfilled.  Just spinkle a little pixie dust and its all going to be good.  What a bunch of bs.  I read about 3 chapters and quit.  Also research some of the jokers behind this book !!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it is so cool! I love all of the games. I highly recommend this app to everyone. have fun playing!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it.  It will read The Word to you.  I also like the manner in which you select chapter and verse.<br /><br />Great app.  The narrator was a pleasant surprise.
B004A8ZX28|1.0|I'm still not sure what this movie was about except that I saw a Bourne movie gone bad with no discernible plot , no direction , no talent maybe except for the young taxi driver that saved the (hero ? ) 's life , the only actor that gave a decent appearance and showed her craft. Everybody driving a car was clearly an expert , don't see them on my roads . And just what was this thing about ? I still don't know . Neeson stumbled through the story along with the rest of the cast , January Jones was about as frigid as the month she was named for , and Aiden Quinn was simply a bit of the background . I DIDN'T LIKE THIS FLICK MUCH ! ! !
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An amazing read! Got hooked on the first chapter, great writing and character development. Cant wait to read the entire series and see what happens. I highly recommend this book to anyone thats looking for a good book to sink their teeth into.
B002VEB228|4.0|As someone who has hiked the same trail and flown the incredible Napili coast of Kauai, this movie exemplified the best of Hawaii.  Fans of \\"Justified\\" will enjoy Tim Oliphant's portrayal of an ex Special Forces quirky character.  The director cheats a bit in confusing us as to the identity of the mass murderers but unless you're rigidly pedantic, this is a fun experience. The suspense builds slowly and the finishing acts well done.  Enjoyed the ride.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book did not live up to the hype. The book's Anastasia was whiny and predictable, and her love interest Christian wasn't much better. If ana isn't busy blushing or tripping and being saved, she's busy checking in on her \\"inner goddess\\" or her self conscious.  They are the proverbial angel and devil living on her shoulders; thank God they cannot speak. The only thing positive about this book are the sex scenes; however those were bordering repetitive and completely unbelievable.  I wouldn't waste your money on this series. I am one of those types of people that have to find out what happens, and I would've been much happier with a new shirt or pair of shoes. It is taking me forever to get through the second book and I'm a fool for buying it.
B002ZG974M|4.0|I showed parts of this movie while teaching a college course on human development.  It was a good tool because of the world-wide perspective and lack of narration.  But as entertainment I don't know- might be a little boring for most people to watch what is essentially a silent film for an hour and a half.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This \\"book\\" is just awful.  It is a sad day in American literature when the Grey series holds the top the three positions on the New York Times Bestseller List.  I will admit I fell for the hype and bought the Kindle additon but once I figure out how to get it off it's history.  I would term the storyline and writing sophmoric but that would be an insult to all sophmores.  Don't waste your time with this one.
0399103422|5.0|Reading the details in the book really gives a new dimension to the movie (actually, the book covers essentially the first TWO movies). For example, when Luca Brazi is being strangled, it talks about how he loses bowel control and the assassin struggles to continue pulling the wire with the overwhelming stench.  The movie just can't convey things like that, but now I watch the scene with the knowledge that that is going on.  A really great book on it's own, but a must-read for fans of the movie.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I'm a fan of King's other novels and I wasn't sure how well he would be able to pull off the alternative history genre. I was impressed that King was able to maintain his characteristic tense, fast-paced writing style even here. The final ~250 pages in particular were very \\"edge of your seat.\\" I actually finished the final third of this novel in one sitting because it was so riveting. Great pacing, great historical accuracy, and a great story make this book worth 5 stars in my opinion.

B00065JTBA|5.0|I love Bon Jovi, so my opinion is not at all objective. :) This collection [[ASIN:B00065JTBA 100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong]] is unique and as good as all the other music the band have ever published or even better. I really enjoyed the booklet inside which contains a lot of fans' opinions about the band and the stories of the songs. The dvd is great too, love to see the guys. If you wanna get to know the band better just buy this product! :) It was delivered very fast, even before I was expecting it. :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am not a big reader so this book was an easy read.  It is no Pulitzer Prize winner but it was entertaining and a great love story.  I lost myself in the books and it was fun to get away from reality for a bit.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I am sooo addicted! I cant put it down half the time haha I strive to beat my high score of 689,078 so fun I definitely recomend

B007MNV5WU|1.0|If I had known that my Kindle Fire wouldn't update as quickly as most Android devices then I would have gone with an Android. Either get this problem fixed ASAP or you're going to be seeing a ton of people deciding to go for a standard Android equipped device when the Fire 2 comes out.

0064430227|5.0|This was not only my favorite book as a child - I'm 55 years old - but it was also my children's favorite book, they now in their 20s.  It was read to me over and over again by my parents when I was a child, the book passed down to my daughter who loves to read it to her son.  My kids recently wanted to memorialize their beloved elderly grandfather who often read the story to them so they got matching tattoos of Harold & his purple crayon.  Harold is a beloved child that lives in each of us, our id, inner child, that eternally childish curiosity, wonder and sense of adventure which opens our hearts and touches us.  I said to my daughter, \\"Isn't the moon awfully high on your shoulder away from Harold?\\"  \\"No,\\" she replies, \\"I love being able to look over my shoulder and see the little moon there.\\"  I guess that little moon will ever remind her of her beloved grandpa.
B0000247D1|3.0|Listening to Bruckner could be likened to lying on your back and looking up at the constellations as they revolve around the axis of the earth. It may not be as viscerally exciting, say, as a visit to the House of the Rising Sun in downtown Bangkok but there is nothing to say that it should be boring. To that end, there is no substitute for imaginative phrasing in this domain.<br /><br />No one doubts that Gunter Wand is a competent Brucknerian. When allied with the Berlin Philharmonic and an atmospheric recording, the output is always going to be listenable in the least - to wit, this performance of the Fourth Symphony (cobbled-together though it is from various performances). At times, the array rises to the occasion: the `Holy of Holies' chorale at the heart of the first movement and the coda of the finale are virtuosity incarnate. And yet so often, to my ears at least, the affair is militated by prosaic phrasing (just listen to the opening three minutes or so of the first movement).<br /><br />But there is a deeper failure here: this symphony is Bruckner's most dangerous excursion into \\"the forests of the night.\\" This performance, sad to say, but fitfully addresses the age-old dynamic of man versus nature. What the hell: it is time for a gratuitous quote to illustrate this point (and all the more so as it is more inspired than anything from yours truly). It was written at the dawn of civilisation:<br /><br /> . . . . . It was then that the lord Gilgamesh turned his thoughts to the Country of the Living; on the Land of Cedars the lord Gilgamesh reflected. He said to his servant Enkidu: \\"I have not established my name stamped on bricks as my destiny decreed; therefore I will go to the country where the cedar is felled. I will set up my name in the place where the names of famous men are written, and where no man's name is written yet I will raise a monument to the gods. Because of the evil that is in the land, we will journey into the great forest and destroy the evil; for in the forest lives Humbaba whose name is `Hugeness', a ferocious giant.\\"<br /><br />But Enkidu sighed bitterly and said, \\"When I lived with the wild beasts in the wilderness I discovered the forest; its length is ten thousand leagues in every direction. Enlil has appointed Humbaba to guard it and armed him with sevenfold terrors; terrible to all flesh is Humbaba. When he roars it is like the torrent of the storm, his breath is like fire and his jaws are death itself. He guards the cedars so well that when a wild heifer stirs in the forest, though she is sixty leagues distant, he hears her. What man would willingly walk into that country and explore its depths? I tell you, weakness overpowers whoever goes near it: it is not an equal struggle when one fights with Humbaba;. he is a great warrior, a battering-ram. Gilgamesh, the Watchman of the Forest never sleeps.\\"<br /><br />Gilgamesh replied: \\"Where is the man who can clamber to Heaven? Only the gods live forever with glorious Shamash, but as for us men, our days are numbered, our occupations are a breath of wind. How is it that you're afraid already! I will go first although I am your lord . . . Then if I fall I leave behind me a name that is everlasting; men will say of me, `Gilgamesh has fallen in battle with the ferocious Humbaba.'\\" . . . . .<br /><br />This dimension is near-absent in this performance of the Fourth. It does not bespeak danger; the immensity of Nature and its indifference to our aspirations are likewise underplayed. It's a Bruckner Fourth that is commodious for an age that would rather forget the primordial roots of Homo Sapiens.<br /><br />So by all means lap up the luxuriant orchestral response. With effort, convince yourself that the Kapellmeister on the podium - and a talented one at that - is  a great conductor. And switch on the fluorescent lights as you listen on: they're a cheap and efficient way to dispel the darkness.<br /><br />If, on the other hand you want to venture withGilgamesh into the great forest, press either of these into service:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0009NDKUU Bruckner: Symphony No. 4]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000IG30 Bruckner: Symphony No. 4]]Gilgamesh into the great forest, press either of these into service:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0009NDKUU Bruckner: Symphony No. 4]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000IG30 Bruckner: Symphony No. 4]]

B007R9MFPU|5.0|After a 25 year absence, I wasn't sure what to expect from my all-time favorite band.  I heard the title track on You Tube and liked it, but how would the rest of the CD sound??? I must admit, I wasn't a big fan of the 1986 release U-Vox. The 1994 release Ingenuity was merely Billy Currie with 3 other musicians borrowing the name Ultravox, but not really authentic at all.  After one listen of Brilliant, I find myself wanting to listen again and again, which is a testament to the music.  There isn't one weak track on the album.  The signature sound of synths blended in with guitar is still here. As is Midge Ure's unmistakable vocals.  Some songs are slower and more mellow than others, but Ultravox has always had those on their albums.  If you need a comparison, I'd say Brilliant has elements of Vienna and Quartet.  Great comeback by a classic new wave band. Let's hope for more in the future.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|These games are wonderful. They challenge my mind in a calm and soothing way.  No noise or distractions. very pleasant.
B0089BSOPA|5.0|Ok just to start this off. This is not the Universal Release that the other below are claiming it is. This release comes from Shout! Factory. It has many bonus features on it and two different versions of the film as well. It's a 2 disc set. This is a must get for any Halloween fan. Before this release the only way to get the TV cut was to tape it or record it with alternative device. Here's all the bonus features that Shout! Factory has given us so far. They have said more details are coming our way at a later time.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />The Theatrical Version and the Television Cut with added footage not seen in the theatrical version<br />Audio commentary with director Rick Rosenthal<br />Audio commentary with stunt co-ordinator/actor Dick Warlock<br />The Nightmare Isn't Over - The Making Of Halloween II, featuring Rick Rosenthal, Lance Guest, Dick Warlock, Alan Howarth, Dean Cundey and more..<br />Horror's Hallowed Grounds: Revisiting the original shooting locations<br />Still Gallery<br />Theatrical Trailer, TV and Radio Spots
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This books is so poorly written that I can hardly believe it's mass appeal. I read it out of curiosity and had to force myself to keep reading. While I see that the sex scenes are ingraining, I have to think the real appeal is the more intimate relationship between the characters that develops despite their sexual relationship. I wouldn't read it unless you like erotica.
B003IMV8HG|4.0|This disc is cool. It's not my favorite by Mariah but it is pretty good and contains some of her staple songs. \\"Honey\\", \\"My All\\" and \\"Breakdown\\" were hits. The dreamy \\"Fourth Of July\\", sexy \\"The Beautiful Ones\\", thoughtful \\"Close My Eyes\\" and powerful \\"The Roof\\" are some of my favorite tracks here.<br /><br />Sensual, sexy and very R&B with little pop, Mariah's 1997 disc is solid. Look to [[ASIN:B000002AVF Daydream]] and [[ASIN:B0007GAERG The Emancipation of Mimi]] for more enjoyable efforts overall. This is my second time reviewing this disc but this is just a quick run through. Plus my favorites have changed pretty drastically I think.<br /><br />4.4 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"The Roof\\"<br />\\"My All\\"<br />\\"Breakdown\\" &<br />\\"Close My Eyes\\"
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Like the movie \\"Easy Rider\\", kindle is easy.  I like that it works across different platforms, updating where I left off from \\"the cloud\\" on both android and Apple OS.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I've been a Uniwar fan for quite a while on iOS.  It's multiplayer multiplatform multifun.  best wargame out there for the thinking player.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is my favorite game iam so glad I have it on my kindle fire and it is free
B0073PPKNM|2.0|Melody opted for a slower tempo here - a MUCH slower, Bossa Nova rhythm which quite frankly almost puts me to sleep.  The songs are dreary, tedious and reminiscent of lifeless background music you hear in hotel lounges and bars.  The Bossa Nova influence is a sign of Melody's inventiveness and desire to break out, but I couldn't find much enjoyment out of it.  I kept waiting for the real album to begin.<br /><br />Track three has a strange, annoying clicking sound present throughout the entire song.  I don't know if it is a faulty disc or sloppy work by the album's producer but it renders the song unlistenable. I can't say much else for the rest of the album except that it is a major disappointment.  Newcomers should avoid this album and rather indulge themselves in Melody's two previous albums, which are beautiful works of soothing and rich jazz music. For me this album's only highlight is its sassy, sexy cover.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|One of Stephen King's strengths as a writer is he knows how to expertly describe the environment the characters find themselves in. The sights, the sounds, the smells, the music, of a much more innocent time are brought vividly to life. Reading this book, I felt as if I were being transported back in time myself. I can give it no higher praise than that.
B007I1Q4W2|4.0|A low budget film,looks great,good music, an interesting take on the whole zombie genre.civil war meets Zombies. very enjoyable.<br /><br />Zombie films I watched recently and I strongly recommend.all different in style and story.<br /><br />JUAN of the Dead - I say the best Zombie film in 2012. I will watch it again soon with friends.<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies - The Asylum produced a really good Zombie film, I was surprised,its good.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|This great case for the Kindle Fire is awesome.  Easy to install the Kindle Fire and protection is a plus.<br />Marware Exchange Case Cover with Stand for Kindle Fire
B0000X61UU|5.0|I have enjoyed this tape for over 15 years and my other tape wore out. This is the best workout possible in my opinion. Plenty of variety, good music, easy to follow and all you need are a set of weights and a chair for balance. (optional) I recommend this over any other. It will whip you into shape quick!!
B005EGXTL2|2.0|I loved the first two books in the series and I was so excited to see how the story was wrapped up in this book.<br />Now that I have finished it, I feel a little disappointed. Not because of how the story ended - I enjoyed all the twists and turns and the ending - but just disappointed in the book in general.<br /><br />I found the story to be extremely slow in some parts, making me just flick through them without reading properly so I could get back to the action and move along. I felt as though too much detail and too many pages were devoted to too many insignificant fluffy details, whilst some of the main events were just summed up and glossed over in a mere paragraph.<br /><br />I could not relate to Katniss in this book. Not at all. She was never one of my favourite characters in the first two books, but in this one she really annoyed me and I just wanted to shake her half the time.<br />Peeta was one of my favourites in the first two books. In this one though, to me, it felt like the author didnt know where to take his story line / character so took an easy option. Same with the ending.<br /><br />I'm glad I've finished with this trilogy. I had to keep reading to find out what happened, but I found the book on a whole to be fairly unpolished and rushed for the most part.
B00881VLCE|4.0|enjoyed the puzzle contents, variety of pictures. It would be nice if you didn't have to scroll through completed puzzles to find new ones.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I loved reading this book, I thought it was thoughtfully written and had a good story line. It had sat in my vast \\"to-read\\" book shelf for a few weeks now, until yesterday, when I won a free copy from Rebecca. I wasn't really sure that I could relate to Wiccan aspect of the main character, but she explained everything so that I didn't feel lost.  I am now kicking myself for not reading it sooner; it is definitely going on the favorites bookshelf!!<br /><br />Fresh out of college, Sophia is living in her grandfather's house and trying to get her life in order. To start, she had to get the buzzing noise out of her head. She began a ritual to clear her head, and it went awry. The buzzing changed to muffled noises, she sees people outside of her house, and gets attacked at a club, in the process meeting Charles. He saves her from impending danger, but it only trusts her into more danger. Sophia learns that she's been a witch for quite a long time, and there is a vast paranormal world. That world that seems suddenly interested in her. She learns to harness her powers to try and save the ones she loves, but sometimes things don't always go as planned.
B00845PT18|2.0|Found myself keeping casual conversation while a lot of talking was going on. I didn't care that I missed dialog. Everything that wasn't confrontation seemed drawn out as if in the sequel we are now to discover a deeper meaning for what we already know to be the storyline. I would not have walked out on it as I have with some other movies, but I am very glad to see it through Amazon which doesn't cost as much as a movie or Dvd.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I was fairly satisfied with this transaction. The product arrived before the estimated arrival date, but it wasnt exactly in the condition that the seller described. It was listed as \\"Very Good\\" and hardly used. After opening it, I discovered two somewhat large scratches on the cd. Several of the songs skipped the first time I listened to it. But it was nothing too major. I'm still pretty happy with the purchase!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I was reluctent to install this after poor reviews but thought I would find out for myself. Scrolling for e-mails is not an issue for me as the settings I have set on PC is to view 200 mails so that is what is onscreen the kindle so it lets me scroll all the way down. I have no adds either, although that may be because I am a Yahoo! Plus User.
B004SB60OC|5.0|Christina Perri has a beautiful voice and I really love her music.  I especially bought this for Jar of Hearts but all the music on this CD is great.
B00005JM8V|5.0|It took me over a month to watch Shoah in its 9 1/2 -hour entirety. Unrelentingly intense, each moment is profound.  This documentary does not contain any archival footage, graphic photos, or reenactments.  And yet, it is the most important and powerful documentary about the Holocaust ever made.  Shoah is comprised entirely of the eyewitness testimony of Holocaust survivors, non-Jewish bystanders, and German perpetrators.  Film of the interviewees is paired with emotionally devastating present-day images of the death camps and the roads, countryside and railroads that led to them.<br /><br />Centered around the Nazi extermination camps of Chelmno, Treblinka, Auschwitz, and the Warsaw Ghetto, Claude Lanzmann, himself a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, is extremely skilled at interviewing all of the Holocaust witnesses, regardless of the role they played.  No explanation or opinion of the interviews are given, and none are needed.  You can see for yourself the anguish of the survivors, the deep-seated antisemitism of the bystanders, and the detached, complex testimony of the perpetrators.<br /><br />Watching Shoah will lend a powerful feeling of intimacy and immediacy to the Holocaust that will help the viewer begin to understand just why it's such an important subject to learn about and remember.  Historically significant and emotionally powerful, Shoah should be required viewing for every person, everywhere.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I was looking forward to a great court room thriller - like The Licoln Lawyer by Michael Connelly type of book.  But this book certainly wasn't it! It's extremely slow and at times extremely boring. None of the characters are likeable. I hated Jacob from the start and Andy (the main character) is just as bad. It is a complete waste of time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My 7 yr old son introduced me to this game &amp; now I'm addicted!  I think it's a lot of fun!
B007TXN4TK|3.0|This game is entertaining for those who enjoy classical elementary music. Its challenging and fun. Its a lot better if you purchase the full version it has more songs and is more difficult.
B001TM1X54|5.0|This book has brought so much laughter. The lion is scary, the monkey is funny, the snake always comes out and \\"tickles.\\" It is very interactive despite it's simplicity, or maybe because of it, if a parent is willing to elaborate and make the animals come to life. IMO, one of the msot important books for the 1 - 2 year old library.
0762445262|3.0|Not sure what the one reviewer expected, and actual life size working light. The title of the product says \\"MINI.\\" It's a toy it works and is fun.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love these kinds of puzzles to the point of near addiction.  This one has plenty of puzzles to keep you entertained for a long while.  I've had it for several weeks and completely skipped the two easy level sections (I might try to get my kids to do those), and I am not close to running out of puzzles.<br /><br />It took me a little while to discover and get used to the controls since I like to dive right in, but once I did, I hardly wanted to put it down.<br /><br />I didn't pay full price, but for the amount of challenge and entertainment I get out of it, it would be worthwhile even at full price. It's certainly less expensive than a paper and ink version and with more puzzles and less eraser dust.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|great character and plot development.  great approach at telling the story and tying it together at the end of the story.
1603427244|5.0|Hi, this is not a review but a question.  Most of the reviews talk of the handy size of the book but I'm wondering about the kindle version, especially if viewed on a phone.  Are the photos and illustrations clear enough to work from, in that format?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Debbie
B0086700CM|5.0|it is the best game ever its hard at first but then you get addicted. best game in the world.
0345373243|5.0|Book was in Excellent condition received in modest amount of time due to  United States Postal System automated distribution center which operate about as reliably as Mr. OBAMA
B0086700CM|5.0|I have found myself staying up way to late at night because I can't put it down! I highly recommend this addicting, fun game.
B0083GPDBO|3.0|A solid effort in the 'found/home video' genre. The penultimate version I've screened would be '[[ASIN:B0018QCXGY Cloverfield]]'. Sadly, the drecks are too numerous to count. This flick falls somewhere in between.<br /><br />Appreciated the writers excluding the logic of the situation. There isn't anything that could resemble a plausible explanation, so, like '[[ASIN:B00005K3NR Carrie]]', the story is all that matters.<br /><br />Tells the tale of three friends who are transformed by a mysterious crystal. Having been changed, they begin to realize that they have extraordinary comic book-like superpowers. Psychokinesis that begins with the minor ability to move small objects quickly escalating to near mystical feats of prowess, culminating in the ability to fly.<br /><br />Matt - the athlete, Steve - the popular student, and Andrew - the outcast.<br /><br />As they accept their new reality, the trio begin to explore their powers with exuberance, laughter, and light-hearted hijinks you expect of teenagers - lifting a girl's dress and the like. However, a close call where an innocent nearly dies has Matt and Steve making \\"a rule\\" that they have to accept responsibility for their actions; echoing the [[ASIN:160549030X Stan Lee]] refrain that with great power comes great responsibility.<br /><br />But outsider Andrew quietly defies the group agreement, he doesn't feel the need to contain and hide. In fact, he's of the mindset that they should personally benefit from their awesome gifts. Beginning with his abusive father - by breaking every bone in his body. The abused kid begins to emotionally and psychologically detach from any moral restraint. Having spent his entire life being the object of humiliation and torment - the effects of having such incredible power begins to take a toll on his sense of morality and even his sanity. And having two popular kids giving him defined boundaries isn't what he wants to hear. Soon, he begins to believe himself beyond his own humanity, a god amongst ants.<br /><br />Enjoyable exploration of the common theme in comic books: What would you do if you *really* had superpowers?<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000HL0K98 A well-worn retread]] that's made enjoyable due to the decent-to-excellent sfx and believable acting by the three co-stars. In particular, was quite impressed with young Alex Russell, who played Matt. A young actor that I think has a lot of potential and on whom I suspect I'll be watching more of in the future.y, a god amongst ants.<br /><br />Enjoyable exploration of the common theme in comic books: What would you do if you *really* had superpowers?<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000HL0K98 A well-worn retread]] that's made enjoyable due to the decent-to-excellent sfx and believable acting by the three co-stars.

B004QL7K8E|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it came out.  At first I was like not another first person digital film, I was expecting another cloverfield.  Could I have ever been so wrong, this movie had me and the wife in stitches. The amount of destruction and mayhem cause in this movie was AWESOME!!!!!!  If I was 17 I would want my party to be just like this one in the movie.  It's hard to believe that this cast was there first movie ever.  This movie is a definate buy on Blu Ray when it comes out. Come on June 19 get here on tomorrow, I have 5 days to go :-)
B0086700CM|4.0|I would definately recommend this game. It's fast paced and fun and is constsntly keeping me on my toes. The only problem is the wallpapers. I can not download them without losing all my pictures. Fix that snd this game is perfect.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game has great graphics.Also it will keep you entertained for hours! But it is kinds weird because it has no ending
B003XDZNNU|5.0|Perfect. Fit, comfort, and cute! I ordered a different style and sent them back - too \\"cloggy\\" - but these are adorable and they are now my official \\"slippers\\" for summer.  I have lots of other styles of Crocs that I wear out for every conceivable activity from boots to boat shoes - but these are the ones I wear around the house.  They are comfortable, cool, and support my arch - important for when I spend hours standing in the kitchen.  Love them.  I usually wear a 71/2 in non-Crocs.  I ordered size 7, and they are perfect.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|cool. I had so much fun playing it a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
B0064Y5U24|5.0|There is not much else I can say that the title dosnt say :) If you like Nickelback you will love it too. All the songs on it are great! Yes it does sound like Nickelback so if you dont like that you will not like this album.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a fantastic app that is not time consuming nor difficult to operate. I love it because it when I need a quick answer it is there.
B004KKX80A|5.0|My son loves his new \\"real\\" Beyblade from Japan.  He is looking forward to buying more! He is looking forward to Christmas.
0345803485|4.0|When I first heard about Fifty Shades of Grey I had no interest in reading it.  Then even more so when I found out that it was based on Twilight fan fiction. I'm not a fan of fan fiction at all.  I also didn't like what I was hearing from people and the press. For those unclear Ms. James did not start the genre.<br /><br />For a few months I went back and forth deciding if I was gonna read it. Finally curiosity just got the best of me and I had to see what all the talk was about.  It seems readers either really love this book or really hate it.  I'm in the first group, I loved it and I'm really surprised I loved as much as I did.<br /><br />While there were a few annoying bits (eye rolling and lip biting), it was a very enjoyable read. As for the Twilight factor there were some similarities, but not to the point where I was comparing all through out the book. Once I started I couldn't stop. It was quite addicting. I wasn't a big fan of Anastasia. As characters go she was pretty weak. Christian on the other hand, I found him very interesting. Yes, he's all sorts of messed up but he had me turning the page to see what happened next.  Fifty Shades of Grey is an obsessive read. If you are gonna read this one make sure you have some free time on hands.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome and fun...................but fast....................have fun and enjoy this game Cuz I know u would like and love it and just want to play it all day long
B0086700CM|5.0|I love. it so much if you get this app push store on the main menu and pick out what you want like a new person or a magnet to attract the coins. the coins you collect buy the stuff in the store and read the top of the screen when you die and it tells you something funny or  what they thaught went on were you died. I love it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love these kinds of games and wish there were more. Although fairly simple (only one puzzle stumped me) it was very enjoyable nevertheless. To me it was a bit like a visual (interactive) book. Worked perfect on my Kindle fire.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. The story is about one person making a difference (like yeast) and bringing a community together to accomplish the seemingly impossible (like bread rising). Love of family, the need to choose, and acceptance that sometimes our best efforts aren't enough. Can we learn from this?
B0086700CM|5.0|yeah well once you start to play this game you will not be able to put it down. this is how I am going to spend my summer with my lover named temple run.
B002KKCWP4|5.0|Hurricane is ok but it hurt my flat feet.  These Tanza's don't hurt my feet and they are very comfortable.  A little pricey but very nice. Good service from Amazon, I needed them overnight for the beach for my middle child and they came for only $4 extra.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I love Big Fish Games on my PC and now I can play my favorites on my Android tablet!  The puzzles in Azada are great and the game is easy to pick up after being away for a while.  If you love Azada on your PC, now you can take it with you!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love Angry Birds, they're addictive no matter which one you're playing.  A game that keeps your mind active and your motley skills young!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard about this book on tv and wasnt sure if i would like it so i downloaded the sample and fell in love!im excited to be starting the 3rd book...
B0086700CM|3.0|Initially, this game is okay, but as it goes on,  it's practically just the same thing over and over again. Jumping. Turning. Ducking. After a while playing on this,  the repeating twists and turns just keep on going, and it becomes boring, especially when you run out of new things to accomplish, unlock, etc. I find this thing okay, but not exactly as exciting as other games- plus, what's the point of it?
B007PTJOV0|5.0|reminds me of super Mario bros that I used to play years ago. love the fact that the leprachauns are whimsical!
B007SGM084|1.0|This book is undoubtably the worst piece of junk, and so-called literature I have \\"attempted\\" to read in all my life. How she got it published is way beyond me! I am not a prude by any means. I like some spice in my reading like everyone else, however,<br />this is totally inane. A huge waste of a few bucks. Don't waste your time or money on a copy. Use your time and hard earned cash on something that has some substance and<br />at least a modicum of class.<br /><br />I only read the first book as it was so nauseating. If I had purchased the trilogy in<br />a book store I would have returned the whole mess. This book sets women back to the stone age.<br /><br />JH
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best game ever! the enjoyment of temple tin can be stored in the kindle fire... have fun ymcmb yolo peace
0817439390|5.0|I got my book on the date promised.  This book was recommended on a blog I was reading for tips on exposure. I I haven't read past the first chapter, but feel it will help me take a better picture with my existing camera. I was looking at buying one with lenses, but may not have to if I read this book and follow the info and tips it provides about cameras and exposure.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i really love this game and it is very awesome i will reccomed this for every age not 1 or 2 or 3 and
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book was interesting to say the least.  I give Jaycee credit for having the courage to write about what happened to her.  It takes a special person to be able to move forward as she has now done.  I admire her for protecting her children.  I cannot in my wildest dreams imagine how she must have felt all those years of being captive and abused.  I do see how eventually a person would break down and try to make peace with the situation as I feel she did just to survive.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved this game on my iPod, now its on my kindle. a bigger screen! yes! love it. it is the best game ever I think.
B0083GPDBO|1.0|I absolutely hated this movie.  It started out pretty decent for a \\"mockumentary\\" type film but ended horribly with the main character being a psychopath!
