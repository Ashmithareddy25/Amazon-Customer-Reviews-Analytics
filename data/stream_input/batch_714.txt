B000S0GYRU|5.0|I saw this movie as a young kid and it was just fantastic. The opening was just so creepy but I couldn't look away. The atmosphere of the film was so great. You really felt like you were there being watched by these witches. This dvd is the best one available because it has the best transfer , the best packaging and the documentary that was on the previous limited edition.  This is a must buy
B000N4SADC|5.0|Hiromi's newest record Time Control is really,really good and is very unique.  The addition of the guitarist to the trio is a cool move on the bands part.  David \\"Fuze\\" I'm not going to attempt to spell his last name, has a neat style.  He blends monstor chops with crazy effects and he plays the fretless guitar which is a real treat.  I think the fretless guitar adds a whole new dimension to the trios sound.  This new record is more about monstor playing going full out on everybodies part.  You drummers out their pay attention,Martin V is ripping it up all over the place on this record.  My personal favorite tracks are #'s 1,2,and 6.  I think fans of Hiromi new and old will really enjoy this album.  If she keeps putting out albums like this and her previous Spiral,she has a long carrear ahead of her.  Get this album and get your hair blown back,or check out her other albums.
0345494997|5.0|I enjoyed this book for rounding out my sense of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney, who was his lover and sometime soul mate for many years.  It's the most pleasant way I know to bring these two powerful people to life in your mind.<br /><br />Most novels deal with romance, hope, and redemption.  Loving Frank is quite different because it displays a tragedy based on imagining the relationship between two real people, the famous architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, and the wife of one of his clients, Mamah Borthwick Cheney, who left her husband and family to live with Wright.  Beyond a few scraps of writing, we know little about Mamah Borthwick Cheney other than what a few friends and the excesses of journalists said about her.  Even though I've read several books about Wright, I didn't get much of a sense about Mamah until reading this book.  I thought that Nancy Horan did a fine job of bringing Mamah to life by imputing reasonable motives to her for the actions she is known to have taken.<br /><br />Frank Lloyd Wright had a reputation for romancing the wives of his clients, but only Mamah left home and hearth for him . . . despite having a comfortable marriage and two children.  Mamah appears to have seen this as an opportunity to become a fulfilled person by having a professional (she was a translator of feminist literature) and a personal life (with Frank) that was continually stimulating.<br /><br />Why, then, is this a tragedy?  Well, Mamah didn't end up doing nearly as much professionally as she hoped, and Wright was often not around . . . or not behaving as he should have.  In addition, Mamah ended up being characterized by the press as a scarlet woman in a way that shamed all of her family and friends.  Her leaving her family affected her children and herself in fundamental ways as well . . . the loss was substantial.  Relations with her author were also strained.  And her life ended in a tragic way.  If you want to know more about the real events, I recommend Death in a Prairie House by William R. Drennan.<br /><br />You can visit Frank Lloyd Wright's home in Oak Park, Illinois as it was constituted in 1909 when he left his family to be with Mamah.  Her home is also nearby.  In addition, you can tour Taliesin near Spring Green, Wisconsin to help you imagine what their life was like.  I have been to all three locations and felt that background helped make the book more real to me.<br /><br />In the end, I found myself wondering what Mamah would have to say about her life if she could be an independent observer.  Was it worth it?  Should she have chosen some other path?<br /><br />Those who are looking for lots of romance between the two will be disappointed in the book.  The scenes where both appear are often more about ideas and culture than they are about the relationship.<br /><br />If you have Frank Lloyd Wright on a pedestal because he was a great architect, this book will help you see his feet of clay.Prairie House by William R.

1582701709|5.0|I don't care if you believe in faith, energy or God, you are certain to get some good ideas from this book. Even though I have my doubts about a higher power, this book has helped me in several areas and has made me a happier person.    One of the aspects from the book is about asking for what you want and imagine that you already have it. You would properly agree that having a goal clearly in your mind will help focus your subconscious mind, and help you - get new ideas, spot new business possibilities and so forth.    The book covers prosperity, your body, your relationships....    I can only recommend this book with all my heart.    Best Regards,  Carsten    Read other reviews at cagoni.blogspot.com
B000SZLSB2|5.0|Awesome CD ... the more I play it ~ and catch all the words ~ the better I like it.   James Blunt has a lot to say ~ and he does get his messages across in his music.  He has 'grown' since his first release.  Purchase it ~ you won't be sorry !
B000LC55F2|5.0|Having watched The Illustionist, a similiar movie that was released around the same time, I was a bit biased when I rented The Prestige. Both movies are fantastic, but this one is better as it is much more dramatic and the story is more complex. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but ironically I was on Christian Bale's side the whole flick, and thought the Hugh Jackman character was a total jerk (sorry loved u in The Fountain)!
1582701709|5.0|Yes, you may say it's a load of old ideas re-packaged into an infomercial-like, catchy-titled product. But that's no argument here. According to the \\"The Secret\\", only those who \\"Ask, Believe, and Receive\\" will attract the joy that they desire. Too bad for those who don't believe or practice the secret. They simply have to go at it another way. This is exactly what the Law of Attraction dictates.    I'm truly glad for the prominence of this product. Otherwise, I could  have missed it altogether. I have bought both the DVD and book for myself and purchased several more as presents to others. So thank you, Rhonda and her team. Thank you for changing my life for the better. It ties in perfectly with what I understand life as a hypnotist and as a believer of the forces of the subconscious mind. I've been feeling so great experiencing joy and gratitude lately that I have forgotten that I had desired for anything at all.

0446672653|5.0|As with \\"Many Lives, Many Masters\\", you'll need to have a open mind to appreciate this brilliant work of Brian Weiss. Here, he relates the discovery that two of his patients, Elizabeth and Pedro, who had not previously known each other, were actually long-lost soulmates. These two had been husband and wife, father and daughter, brother and sister and were, in each of those lifetimes that were uncovered, bonded strongly to each other. The two were finally reunited, with a little help from the doctor.    I now comprehend the meaning of the word, \\"soulmates\\" and \\"love\\" at a different level, from a different perspective altogether. These revelations opened my mind to a new definition of love- something that is unconditional, true, and pure. When I look into the eyes of my beloved son now, I no longer question why I love him so. I can only love him even more. And it also gives me reassurance and hope for a better, more emotionally fufilling life ahead, whether it is in my current lifetime or the next.    In many ways, I find this book more powerful than \\"Many Lives\\". It touches my life in many aspects, such as the topic of miscarriages, that was briefly mentioned. The explanations for various phenomena in life given in terms of souls and rebirthing leave an everlasting sense of calm within me. This book will be of great help for individuals who are struggling with relationships. For people who think they don't need it, think again, because it helped me.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|When a new Down release comes around, I get very excited. To me, Down is a group where every member shines, you get the feel of these guys in their natural environment. This new one progresses their sound further, though I am tempted to say its closer to the original album. Every song is very groove-laden, lots of nifty hooks and heavy, moderately-paced rock and roll. Phil Anselmo's voice has softened a bit, but I suggest that it fits with the tone of the music by standing out less than he has been known to do. They are still powerful vocals performances, his maturity is starting to show. Pepper and Kirk are at the top of the riffing game, and Jimmy and Rex keep the head bobbing. This is today's classic rock folks! Some Down fans didn't like II as much, you may really enjoy this album, it has the *ahem* 'sloppiness' of Nola, with the songwriting sensibility of II.     Oh and those still making Pantera comparisons... go listen to Damageplan and Hellyeah again. Then listen to Down. Now compare ;)
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I think it was Trey Parker who was interviewed a few years ago and said, regarding his politics, \\"I hate conservatives but I f****** HATE liberals!\\"  This film certainly conveys that sentiment perfectly.  On the one hand, you've got crazed Americans in red-white-and-blue jets destroying various world landmarks while chasing Osama bin laden look-alikes; on the other hand, the sneering directed at Hollywood and liberals in general (\\"...and they act all corporation-y...\\") is far more visceral and emphasized.  Recommended to anyone on the right, and if you're on the left, you'd probably better skip this one.<br /><br />James Taranto remarked on opinionjournal a few weeks ago that \\"Team America\\" is the only even partially pro-Global War on Terror movie made.  That got me thinking.  *I* certainly can't think of another one, but I can think of several anti-GWOT films (\\"e.g., \\"Valley of the Wolf\\") with a slough more of them right around the corner (e.g., \\"Redacted\\").  I feel bad that the only pro-GWOT film is constituted by puppets, but I guess that's about as much as we can expect out of Hollywood.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|In a deliciously ironic scene from David Fincher's crime thriller, \\"Zodiac\\", San Francisco homicide investigator Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), stalks out of a screening of \\"Dirty Harry\\". He is appalled at what he sees as Hollywood's obvious and crass exploitation of a real-life case that has consumed his life-the hunt for the notorious and ever-elusive \\"Zodiac\\" serial killer, who terrorized the Bay Area for a good part of the 1970's. (Clint Eastwood's fictional nemesis in \\"Dirty Harry\\" was a serial killer who taunted the authorities and the media, and referred to himself as \\"Scorpio\\").    That is one of the \\"little touches\\" in Fincher's multi-layered true crime opus that makes it an instant genre classic. The director has wisely eschewed the broad brush strokes of Grand Guignol that he slathered on in \\"Se7en\\" for a meticulously detailed etching that is equal parts Michael Mann and Stanley Kubrick, and thoroughly engrossing cinema.            The director's notorious perfectionism serves the protagonists well-they are all obsessed individuals. The aforementioned Inspector Toschi and his partner Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards, in a nice comeback) are the type of dedicated cops that have could have strolled right out of an Ed McBain novel. Master scene-stealer Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as Paul Avery, the cocky crime reporter for the S.F.Chronicle who gloms on to the case; his \\"partner\\" of sorts is the Chronicle's political cartoonist, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is the first person to connect the dots (thanks to his obsession with cryptograms and puzzles). The nerdish Graysmith eventually becomes the most obsessed of them all, conducting an independent investigation over two decades.    Fincher has assembled a film that will please true crime buffs and noir fans alike. The combination of location filming, well-chosen period music and Fincher's OCD-like attention to detail recreates a cinematic vibe that I haven't experienced sincethe golden days of Sidney Lumet (think \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\", \\"Serpico\\" or \\"Prince of the City\\".)
B000OCXFCO|5.0|In my opinion Megadeth's 2nd best album after \\"Rust in Peace\\". Metal at it's best. They pull the strings hard in this one. You won't be disappointed with this one.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|Robert De Niro takes the director's chair in this 2006 CIA epic. Matt Damon stars as Edward Wilson, whose career as an agency spook begins with his enlistment into the OSS during WW 2 and continues through that organization's metamorphosis into the CIA.    The film opens in 1961, at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion. When we are first introduced to Wilson, it is quickly established that he is an officious and inscrutable, yet loyally dedicated Company man. As the story begins to jump back and forth in time (a la \\"Godfather II\\") we begin to get glimpses of what lies beneath Wilson's seemingly impenetrable veneer.    We witness a (relatively) looser and more outgoing Wilson during his college days at Yale in 1939, as he is inducted into the infamous Skull and Bones society. As part of the initiation ritual, he is directed to regale his fellow Bonesmen with the deepest, darkest secret from his past. The club members get more than they bargain for as Wilson relates a harrowing childhood memory of bearing witness to his father's suicide. Moments before taking his own life, his father hands down a credo about \\"trust\\", which becomes the key to unlocking Wilson's inner workings for the remainder of the film.    Therein lies the problem with \\"The Good Shepherd\\". There is an awful lot of internalizing going on (for 2 hours and 47 minutes). De Niro's plus as a director (not surprisingly) is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters. His minus as a director is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters, if you catch my drift. There are some pacing issues with the film. Not that I was expecting car chases and stuff blowing up real good. After all, the reality of espionage does not necessarily lend itself to flash cuts and pop music montage. It's generally a somewhat somber, mundane and unpleasant business.    Eric Roth's script has its moments, but gets murky when it comes to the intrigue. It is tough to keep track of who is doing what to whom, and why (and at times, for whose \\"side\\"?). Granted, perhaps that is part of the point; torture is torture and murder is murder, no matter how one attempts to rationalize (a point that Steven Spielberg more than sufficiently bludgeoned us over the head with in \\"Munich\\") but I GET it,already.    Perhaps the most fatal flaw in the film is Matt Damon's unconvincing \\"aging\\". There is not much discernable physical transformation between Wilson's collegiate years and middle age. (Maybe some better prosthetic work could have helped?). At any rate, I just wasn't buying it, and found it to be a major distraction. Damon is a fine actor, but I think he may have been slightly miscast here. History buffs may still find the film worth a look.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I watched the series on Discovery HD and was extremely impressed.  I had high expectations for the quality in the transfer to Blu-Ray and I was not let down.  The picture and sound is stunning.  It is a \\"show case\\" title to show off the picture of your Blu-Ray players to others.  The BBC version has longer episodes then the american version.  The added footage is mixed throughout the episodes.  Their are some great shots which were cut in the Discovery version.  I usually don't watch a lot of nature documentaries, but this one is  must own for everyone.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|The Siege of Seattle continues. New York is in flames. The \\"world's youngest living person\\" has tragically died at 18, to the dismay of millions of \\"fans\\". Authorities in the U.K. continue a relentless,SS-style round up of all illegal immigrants, crowding them into Gitmo-like compounds. Most significantly, scientists remain at a loss to explain why a universal plague of female infertility continues unabated into its eighteenth year. These are some of the cheery news headlines dominating the year 2027 in the not so distant, dystopian future of Alfonso Cuaron's  \\"Children of Men.\\"    The story is set in (a not so) jolly old England, where we are introduced to glum-faced Theo (Clive Owen), a world-weary bloke working in some kind of vague, low-level bureaucratic job in London. He is not having a good morning. After narrowly escaping death by terrorist bombing on the way to work, he decides to beg off a day at the office, only to be kidnapped by a group of radical human rights activists     It turns out that the cell is led by Theo's ex-wife (Julianne Moore), who wants him to use his connections to pull some strings and help out a \\"very important\\" colleague, (a female immigrant with a Big Secret). Initially, the reluctant Theo is determined to keep his activist roots safely embedded in the past, but fate and circumstance soon rekindle his old idealism, and he finds himself risking life and limb to help deliver the only known fertile woman in the world to the sanctuary of an organization called the Human Project .    The film ultimately spreads itself a bit too thin as a political potboiler; there are too many confusing factions of insurgents, activists and terrorists running about killing government troops and each other with equal abandon (not unlike Iraq). However, the film does become quite gripping as a straight-ahead action-thriller, especially in its final third. Cuaron effectively applies an oppressive, steel-grey visual look to his cold, cruelly bleak future vision.     From a purely thematic standpoint, I thought that the rampant use of Christ metaphor became a bit much (especially in an eye-rolling Big Death Scene that is a bit too reminiscent of \\"The Omega Man\\").    There still are enough good reasons to recommend seeing this film, particularly for the uniformly excellent performances. The ubiquitous Michael Caine steals all of his scenes as Theo's mentor, an aging hippie activist. An honorable mention must be given as well to the always wonderful Peter Mullan (\\"My Name Is Joe\\", \\"Trainspotting\\"), who really chews up some major scenery as an opportunistic immigration control officer.
0767817664|4.0|Vampire movies are almost by definition parodies, the only variable being the degree and the quality of the parody elements vs the scare elements. &#34;Fright Night&#34; (1985) is neither the best parody nor the scariest thriller, but it has the distinction of being the all-time best mix of the two. Both its parody and its scare elements work extremely well and their juxtaposition really makes the film worth seeing.  &#34;Fright Night's&#34; production design will remind you of &#34;Gremlins&#34;, a contemporary film, but the spirit of the film is more along the lines of Polanski's &#34;Fearless Vampire Killers&#34;.  Average suburban teen Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) accidentally discovers that his new neighbor is an evil vampire. The vampire is not particularly discrete, not bothering to pull the window shades and disposing of a victim in a plastic garbage bag. Charley unwisely goes public with his accusations. This tips off the vampire that his teenage neighbor may be a threat. But he is still safe because nobody believes vampires are real.  Not only does no one believe Charley but the vampire discovers that Charley's girlfriend Amy resembles his lost love, which makes her a target. Amy is played by a young Amanda Bearse (&#34;Married With Children&#34;), which you will probably find a bit disconcerting for several reasons but it is kind of interesting to see her as a hot teen love interest.  In desperation Charley goes to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), the host of the local television show called &#34;Creature Features&#34;.  The special effects are excellent and not overdone. Dorothy Fielding who plays Charley's airhead mother should get special mention for her excellent performance. One of the running gags during the first half of the film is her failure to find anything suspicious about her new neighbor or his nighttime activities.  Then again, what do I know? I'm only an inner child.
1881273563|4.0|I found the book worthwhile to listen to. The author offered good practical advice to improving your relationship.

B000TENE6Y|5.0|I consider this album to be the absolute best album of the past 20 years or so.  Maybe the best of all time??????  Not as genre inspiring as Nirvana's Nevermind but just as groundbreaking.     One of those albums that comes along and surprises the hell out of you and around the 3rd or 4th time you listen to it completly, you realize just how damn good it is.    Always at my number one spot when you get into that conversation with your buddies about all time best album.
B000087HXO|5.0|If you aren't a Kraftwerk fan already, then in my opinion there are better introductions -- like Minimum Maximum. If you are a fan, this recording is an absolute must have. Krafwerk foreshadowed the digital era way back in the 70's and 80's using analog synthesizers, often of their own design and construction. The sound is less precise, dynamic and hard- edged than modern Kraftwerk, but it sounds more \\"musical\\" -- in that Man-Machine sort of way. Four of the tracks on this album are absolute classics, with two of them (Model and Neon Lights) containing two of the most unforgettable melodies ever to come out of \\"pop\\" music.

B000E1MTY0|5.0|I just watched this film on HD DVD last night, and was completely blown away.  Batman Begins is a gritty superhero film, and a fantastic reboot of a languishing franchise.  I loved this movie in the theater, and saw it twice on the big screen.  I also own this movie on DVD, and have watched it countless times.  Watching this on HD DVD, however, was a completely different experience.  I could hardly believe how detailed and rich the images were, and how colorful the movie actually is, despite the overall dark theme.    Some things that I had never noticed before:  - The small spirals of smoke coming from the henchmen's guns as they search for the Dark Night on the docks.  - The fine detail of the ninja outfits during the Tibet scenes.  - The details in the shadows on The Narrows.  For any fans of this film, the HD DVD edition will not disappoint.

B0000019PA|5.0|Simply put, listen to this album. While it has its high points and lesser (but never 'low') points, from start to finish, it is the work of a musical genius... after you listen to it a few times, read a few interpretations of the songs (Jeff Mangum, the lead singer, said in numerous interviews that he wrote much of the albumm of dreams he had of Ann Frank!), and listen to the songs again-- you'll hear something entirely different.

This was one of the worst pieces of garbage I've ever read and to think that the author might make a dime from this is absurd.What an incredible con artist Jordan Belfort is. I was certainly conned into buying this dumb book. I wish I had been able to read a review in Amazon before buying. It most definitely would have given me second thoughts. He got away with a much lighter sentence than he deserved merely because he ratted on others with probably trumped up information to save his own skin. Pass this one up.

B000002LEM|4.0|Van Halen's second album with their then new lead singer Sammy Hagar, and eight overall, is a strong collection, falling just slightly behind the 1995 disc BALANCE as the third best Van Hagar record.  Released in 1988, the musical landscape was still dominated by hair metal and power ballads (NEVERMIND was three years away), and being a typical 1980s record you get a surprising diverse, eclectic album from the boys.<br /><br />The album itself is a much more versatile album than most Van Halen albums.  Featuring blues (A Apolitical Blues), power ballads (Feels So Good, When It's Love), winding epics (Cabo Wabo), country picking (Finish What You Started), metallic rockers (Mine All Mine), and social commentary (Sucker in a 3 Piece), the album has both good lyrics (for hair metal, at least) and an expanded sonic template on the majority of the songs.  For OU812, Van Halen returned to a more guitar oriented approach, though there are still synths in the mix.<br /><br />What makes OU812 such a breath of fresh air is Van Halen moving away from singing typical party anthems and broaching more serious subject matter.  \\"Mine All Mine\\", one of my favorite songs from the band, deals with religion and has some great lines (such as I was looking for the light staring at the sun and nearly ended up blind), and for once is not nearly as pagan as some of their other material about religion.  This exploration of more serious material would culminate in BALANCE and VAN HALEN III, but this exploration is definitely presence here.<br /><br />There are some uneven moments, but nothing too distracting.  \\"A. F. U.\\" and \\"Source of Infection\\" are absolute drivel lyrically, with Sammy just yelling his head off spouting a bunch of random phrases.  Fortunately, both songs jam hard, and it shows the lyrics, if you can call them that distinguished name, were in all likelihood improvised to provide vocals for the instrumental tracks.  If you don't like the blues, you won't like the Little Feat cover, but it's a good song overall, even if it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the album's atmosphere.  It should be noted this was the first (and so far, last) cover to appear on a Van Halen record since that artistic embarrassment DIVER DOWN.<br /><br />Listening to \\"Cabo Wabo\\" now may be hard without adopting the rather cynical attitude that it's a seven minute long advertisement for Sammy's business ventures and tequila, which is a shame, as it's a great song.  This was before Sammy set up shop in Mexico, or if he had set up shop he was just branching out there when the band wrote the song.<br /><br />While I do like the lyrics on several of the songs, sometimes Van Halen comes off as overly hormonal and sexually driven [to the point of immorality].  \\"Can't Finish What You Started\\", one of the sonic highlights because as far as instrumentals go sounds like nothing else in the Van Halen catalogue, is Sammy begging for some action and blaming his chick for him having blue balls.  Oh, and he says \\"baby\\" a lot (too much, really).  \\"Black and Blue\\" has the memorable lines \\"The harder the better, we'll do it till we're black and blue\\" and \\"slip and slide, push it in, bitch sure got the rhythm\\".  Nobel Prize committee will be serving Sammy his nomination in Literature very soon, no doubt.  Still, the song has some good music too it.  Still, it would be nice if they weren't so testosterone driven and focused mostly on sex.  But then again, this is the party boy band Van Halen, so you take what you can get.<br /><br />As far as its relationship with the other three Van Hagar albums, 5150 is the best, followed by BALANCE, this record, and then FOR UNLAWFUL CARNAL KNOWELDGE.  Unfortunately, Van Halen on the follow up retreated away from the electic verstality of this record and instead turned out some of the most basic, unmemorable rock of their career with FOR UNLAWFUL CARNAL KNOWLEDGE.  I wish that record had taken a page from this one's book and been a little more open in their musical compositions and forms.  Oh well, the records are what they are.<br /><br />Taken as actual albums, OU812 is a better record than BALANCE.  However, the best songs on BALANCE easily outmatch the best songs from OU812.  Because of the strength of the best of BALANCE's songs (read my review for more info), I think had the deadweight been cut from that record it would have been better than even 5150.  Due to the strength of those songs along, I give BALANCE the edge over OU812.

Taken as actual albums, OU812 is a better record than BALANCE.  However, the best songs on BALANCE easily outmatch the best songs from OU812.  Because of the strength of the best of BALANCE's songs (read my review for more info), I think had the deadweight been cut from that record it would have been better than even 5150.  Due to the strength of those songs along, I give BALANCE the edge over OU812.  But, on the flip side, worst songs on OU812, which are at least listenable and only mildly distracting, are nowhere near as bad as the worst songs on BALANCE.

B000001ELR|4.0|This album has some of the best sounding drums of any album from that time period.  Eric Carr was a stud when it came to banging on the skins. If KISS could have captured the sound of this album back around the time they produced \\"Dynasty\\", they may have never had the huge slump they wound up having. This is probably the heaviest KISS album there is with \\"Revenge\\" following a close 2nd. COTN never got the attention it should have because at the time, KISS was pretty much old hat. I hate Ace did not play on this album, but it probably would have sounded completely different if he had. Overall, it rocks. Worth going back and checking it out if you did not catch it at the time.
B000002MUP|4.0|BALANCE is a record I have a hard time adjusting too.  I find that it has some of Van Halen's best material of their career, and it could have been the best Hagar-lead album, even better than 5150.  As it is, BALANCE is a record cluttered with songs that should have been left off and completely kill the momentum of the album.<br /><br />By 1995, grunge had taken over the world.  Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder forever changed the rock and roll landscape, and most hair bands simply did not survive.  Eddie Van Halen must have known how widely different the music milieu was, and tried adjusting Van Halen's sound to fit more closely in the times.  So Van Halen recorded Balance, an oddly uneven record.<br /><br />In 1991, when Hagar and co. did their last album, the music terrain hadn't changed.  FOR UNLAWFUL CARNAL KNOWELDGE had been released about three to four months before Nirvana's NEVERMIND.  That record was pretty straight forward, with some decent moments but overall rather run-of-the-mill.  After NEVERMIND hit, everything changed, and bands like Van Halen found it difficult to continue.<br /><br />Rather than do typical 1980s record, which wasn't possible from a career perspective, Eddie decided to expand the band's musical template, May 14 2007 redefining their direction and their music tastes.  And in a wonderful way, when the band strikes gold, they hit big time.  Unfortunately, as oft as not they just clutter the record with moments that don't quite work.<br /><br />About half the record easily stands head and shoulders above their contemporaries, with inventive arrangments, poignant social commentary, lovely pop songs that may amount only to guilty pleasures but powerful nonetheless, excellent guitar work by Maestro Eddie.  These songs are \\"Seventh Seal\\", \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\", \\"Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do,\\" \\"Not Enough,\\" \\"Aftershock,\\" \\"Déjà vu,\\" and \\"Feeling\\".  For me, these are the core songs of this record.  \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" is one of their bigger radio hits (pretty impressive given the radio terrain of 1995), and \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"Feeling\\" are among their top songs.  You can clearly feel Van Halen reinventing themselves and making just great music.  But there's one problem.<br /><br />Sammy Hagar.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I love Sammy.  But Sammy's a partier, and a rock and roll star.  While Eddie has proven himself a total ass on several different occasions, musically, he's has a more versatile identity than Hagar.  While Eddie's trying to bring the band to a more mature artistic point in their life, Sammy just wants to cut up and party hearty.  Hence \\"Amsterdam.\\"  Hence the 1950s rockabilly \\"Big Fat Money.\\"  That, along with the three bizaare instrumentals, clutter the record and effectively emasculates the other music.  The two aforementioned songs are not only the worst on the record, but are complete failures in tone with the rest of the overall record's musical identitiy.<br /><br />Given these failures in tone, and how the instrumentals continually usurp the momentum of the record before it can really get going, the record never quite gels like it should.  It continually sounds like Eddie is wanting to move the band lyrically and musically into new and different directions, but Hagar frustrates Eddie's ambitions. So, oddly enough, you get an odd dichotomy, and you can feel a tension between the two.  Once Eddie jettisoned Hagar from the band and hired Gary Cherone to be the lead singer, he found a new freedom to explore and expand the band's sonic identity, though many wrote the band off after the career killing VAN HALEN III.  But that is neither here not there.<br /><br />I will say this: I believe BALANCE has not only some of the best material of the Sammy Hagar era, but has some of the strongest writing on ANY Van Halen album.  I think had Eddie deleted the two pointless instrumentals and \\"Big Fat Money\\" (he even could have left in Amsterdam), maybe write some lyrics to Balauchtherim, and included the Balance B-Side Amsterdam and the Twister soundtrack song \\"Humans Beings\\", you would have the best Van Hagar album ever.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is a very good record here, and with a little pruning, this could have been the strongest Van Hagar album of the four Sammy records.  I think OU812 is a better overall album and flows and has a much more cohesive feel than BALANCE, but the best songs on BALANCE beat anything OU812 has to offer.  As it stands, I think it very narrowly edges out OU812 for the second best Hagar album, behind 5150 as the best, with FOR UNLAWFUL CARNL KNOWLEDGE being the worst.  OU812 is the better album overall, but BALANCE has the better songs.<br /><br />Bottom line: with better sequencing and more selective track selection, this would have been the best Van Hagar album.  As it stands, it's the second best.<br /><br />May 9, 2007
B000001EKX|3.0|Kiss was under a tremendous amount of pressure to quickly get in the studio and cut their second album.  Overall, the material is pretty good but the sound quality will leave you wanting to adjust your stereo. Don't bother.  Some of these songs went on to become Kiss Classics so it is worth the purchase price.
B000002LPD|3.0|The third Van Hagar album, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, is the most pedestrian of all of Van Halen's albums.  This is easily the worst Van Hagar album.  Not that it's bad, just rather average.  Of the four Van Halen albums with Sammy, this one sounds the most like his solo career, with the only difference being some good guitar licks from Maestro Eddie    In many ways, this album marks the end of an area.  Though no one knew it at the time, alterative was poised to overthrow hair metal and was about to become a dominant, musical cultural force.  Van Halen released this album in June of 1991, a mere three months before Nirvana released NEVERMIND, the album that would change everything in the rock landscape.  Van Halen's catalogue up to this point has always been primary had a party atmosphere, and this album is the last in the celebration line.  Balance, the 1995 followup to this album, is a much darker affair, and VAN HALEN III Eddie changed directions both for the band image and the lyrical direction completely.  In many ways, this is the last feel-good, everything's a party atmosphere that so dominated Van Halen as a band.  Sammy Hager, however, is still cashing in on that atmosphere (just like at his hard-rock send up of Jimmy Buffet in \\"Livin' It Up\\" from 2006).    The album title is a well known acronym.  Originally, Sammy Hagar just wanted to call the album \\"F--- \\" in a attempt to press the censorship issues, but after being told by his boxing friend Ray Boom Boom Mancini that word is an acronym for \\"for unlawful carnal knowledge,\\" he back away from this flat vulgarity and went with this title.  Promo material made a big deal out of this, with T-shirts sold during the 1991 tour having the title written vertical on the t-shirt with the first letter written in bright red.    Coming off the heels of OU812, which opened up the Van Hagar template to include instrumental flourishes and strong craft never before heard on a Van Halen disc, the band instead pares down their sound and instead churns out basic rock and roll.  They take away the synth that was featured prominently on their proceeding albums and replaced it with guitar and piano.  While basic rock and roll never hurt anybody, given its predecessor, it would help if the album branched out more.  Make the music worth returning too.  As is stands, however, FOR UNLAWFUL CARNAL KNOWLEDGE is your basic meat and potatoes rock and roll.    The music is rather straightforward (sometimes to the point of being dull).  In many ways it feels like the band is rather running on empty.  While Eddie's guitar heroics are always impressive, unfortunately, the song-writing simply isn't that strong.  The music sounds like generic 1980s rock, with only the guitar to distinguish it.  But, as I've long maintained, guitar is only one portion of a great band, and it can become an Achille's heel if you rely on it to carry the album through to hide average or weak songwriting.    \\"Poundcake\\", along with \\"Right Now\\" is probably the best known songs on the album.  Poundcake features some smoking playing, with the band really sinking their chops into the music.  The drill intro is great.  Eddie finally put  \\"Right Now\\" onto a Van Halen disc, a song written in the early 1980s (around the album 1984 or Diver Down).  He felt Roth wasn't the right singer for the song.  An uplifting song, and one used at a lot of Chicago Bulls games during the 1990s (the intro at least), Right Now was a huge hit for the band, and is one of Van Halen's most well known songs.  Their \\"Hey Jude\\", if you will.    \\"Man on a Mission,\\" \\"In and Out\\" (even though the title would appear to be about sex, it's about taxes, economic oppression, and being ripped off by the \\"system\\") and  \\"Dream is Over\\" don't really have anything to distinguish them as notable songs. \\"Spanked\\" is, crudely enough, about phone sex and masturbation (call her up, on the spank line!).  Sounds like a bad DLR parody, actually.    \\"Judgement Day\\" is a lyrically bad song for those with religious sensibility. Here Hagar makes it quite clear he has \\"no faith, no religion\\", and he will live his life as he pleases and put off righteous living until \\"judgement day\\".  That will be the biggest mistake of his life, and Van Halen's and anyone else's who really lives that life thus.  You would think Eddie would think about spiritual matters given he had a child just born when this album was released but apparently not.     \\"Runaround\\" has a catchy, sing-a-long chorus and is pleasurable to listen too.  Eddie on several of VH's albums has a guitar instrumental, and this is no exception.  Always liked the guitar instrumental 3:16 (titled for Eddie's son's birthday, Wolfgang), especially the tap playing at the end of this brief song.  \\"Top of the World\\" was a moderate hit, and deservedly so.  The main guitar riff from \\"Top\\" can actually be heard at the end of the 1984 track \\"Jump\\".    That about accounts for all the songs, except one.  \\"Pleasure Dome\\".  Easily the best song on the album, Van Halen does things lyrically that they would never do before or since.  Rather than going with women and sex and their usual (oft times boring by this stage of their career) subject matter, instead they turn in an abstract poem that always gets me going whenever I hear it.  For once on the record, the music is also a large contribution to the success of the track over all.  While Pleasure Dome references Coolidge's \\"Kubla Kahn\\", overall the song just drives its meaning and imagery home like any good epic rock song will.  I love wrapping my mind and thoughts around Hagar's words - unlike Bob Dylan or Jim Morrison, this is one of the very few songs where his lyrics create a rather otherworldly, poetic effect or epiphany.  While Hagar is no great lyricist, here he manages a nice song.  The opening riff is also a homage to the Rush song  Xanadu from the 1977 album A FAREWELL TO KINGS, which is also about those fabled pleasure domes.    Overall, a rather lackluster affair.  The songs are decent, and there's not a single \\"bad\\" song here.  Just not really any great songs either, save for \\"Pleasure Dome\\" and \\"Right Now\\".  I'll be generous and include 3:16 as well. Easily Van Halen's most \\"average\\" album. Still worth a listen if you're a fan.  If not, make this the last of the four Van Hagar album you buy.
B00000JPYQ|3.0|UFO was at their best on this disc, however that still comes up a little short when compared to the great bands of the 70's.  I like the album and there is some great guitar work from MS but the songs are not as strong as compared to a collection from bands like the Scorpions or AC/DC. Either way, if you like UFO or just want to see what they were all about, this is a great place to start. I recommend it.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|I you liked the first two Down cd's?, then you'll love this one.<br /><br />What you'll find here is typical Down style writing, southern metal with a big helping of Sabbath mixed in. What's not to like?<br /><br />Down continues to evolve in a good way. The first Down cd had tons of great tunes and lots of angst. The second release had another helping of great riff's, but perhaps not as maybe hits so to speak. However I thought the second release was a step forward as far as the band went. The tunes weren't as rough sounding and seemed to be laid out with a little more thought. Yes that power and aggression was tamed just a bit from the first release, yet the angst and attitude was still alive and well. This release is yet again a step forward, Phil sings more, screams less, Peppper and Company are tight as hell and the sound is more polished overall. I'd say this is Down's best effort to date. I'm not sure if they'll ever recapture the magic of that first release?, but the fact of the matter is, they continue to get better even though the hits (if you want to call them that?) aren't their.<br /><br />Buy it!!

0679720200|1.0|This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_, but upon reflection I have decided that I would rather read _Star_ again than read _The Stranger_ again, although I would rather be eaten alive by rabid wolverines than do either. This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it. If I had a time machine, I would pay to have Camus beaten to death on a deserted beach, ultimately preventing this disaster from ever coming into existence.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|Will Smith continues to amaze me.  Up until his performance in \\"I, Robot,\\" I couldn't see him for anything more than a goofy rapper-turned-actor who played characters based solely on the degree of their sarcasm and humor.  In \\"I, Robot,\\" I began to see beyond the old Smith and came to see him as an adult who could pull off excellent roles.  With \\"The Pursuit of Happyness,\\" Smith shows that he's matured even more.  Not once did I picture him as Carlton's cousin or the cocky flyboy from \\"Independence Day.\\"  He has come full circle as an actor and deserves to be recognized for it.<br /><br />\\"Happyness\\" is based on the real-life story of Chris Gardner, a man who lost everything trying to do what's best for his family and eventually becoming a top stockbroker and businessman.  The viewer basically lives out the struggles of a man with not much more than street smarts and a high school diploma to get him, his girlfriend, and son through life.  Fed up with the life Gardner provides, his wife (Thandie Newton) leaves him and (reluctantly) their son (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) for the greener pastures of New York.  Determined to make it in San Francisco, Gardner takes a non-paying internship with Dean Witter and has to rely on his dwindling and hard-to-sell stock of bone density scanners to put food on the table.  Needless to say, Gardner and his son face immense hardships, eventually being forced to live on the street, staying in a public bathroom and shelters in order to survive.<br /><br />The story's outcome is wonderful and heartwarming.  I'm not ashamed to say that this film made me cry.  It is a perfect realization of every father's greatest fear:  not being able to provide for his family.<br /><br />Kudos to Gardner for overcoming immense odds.  Kudos to Smith, his son, and the rest of the cast and crew who made \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" a stellar film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Just picked up the latest offering from Mark Knopfler - \\"Kill to Get Crimson\\".  A beautiful, subtle CD.  If you're still looking for \\"Money for Nothing\\" look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a mature look at life from a master of understated, brilliant songwriting and musicianship, buy this CD.  \\"All the Roadrunning\\" with Emmylou Harris is also recommended.

0321344758|5.0|It's a good sign when a usability expert's book is highly usable, and so this one is-- a fast read, very scannable, makes substantive points quickly, then follows them up with illustrative examples and lots of nice graphs and pictures. I've seen a couple people here comment that this book is only for beginners, but given the state of MOST sites that I find on the web (yes, this includes e-commerce sites and big brand sites that OUGHT to be very usable), I'd say this book is for ALL LEVELS OF WEB DESIGNERS. Consider it your basic reference for features that every site ought to have in order to be usable and marketable. Also, its a handy source to show to your boss/client when they want to do something silly with their site design-- it's highly quotable and is written to appeal to a business audience.
B000UR366S|5.0|This is a beautiful, intelligent and heartfelt album...and it's actually about something.  Lately most of the music which I see getting praised and coddled by critics, and then sold by the major media corporations, seems to be about nothing at all. I find much of what I hear out there to be no more than marketing plugs for other products too.  So, it's very refreshing to listen to someone with an opinion again -- remember those? -- and it's even more refreshing to not hear any product plugs in the lyrics (e.g. Kanye West's `Stronger' - a very catchy tune, but read the words!)      Yes, she's signed to Starbucks, but they're on board to promote and sell the album, not write the lyrics.  Marketing is not the music here, which seems to be becoming more and more rare.  I think that is precisely why this album has been criticized quarters too: it doesn't fit into the current every-song-is-a-marketing-cross-promotional-opportunity consumerism template which has been accepted and even endorsed by many music critics.       `Shine' isn't like that: this woman has something to say about EVERYTHING, and it's not about selling her clothing line.  Although sometimes the writing on `Shine' isn't as poetic as on her past efforts, I actually appreciate the clear, concise declarative statements of her words here (it's almost like reading Hemmingway at times: \\"Are his eyes that bad?  He is almost blind.  It is strange.\\" does read a bit like some of her couplets such as \\"You give bad attitude/You have no grace /No empathy/No gratitude\\").  I may not even always agree with all of her sentiments, but I so appreciate hearing a point-of-view again and a person who's not afraid to say what they think.          As for the music - it's amazing.  Take the ambient folk/pop of `Night Ride,' `Indigo,' and `Taming the Tiger,' cross it with the recent orchestral experiments and the avant-jazz of `Hissing,' `Don Juan' and `Hejira' and you'll have `Shine'.     Which brings me to my last point: Joni Mitchell is a true artist because you can follow her musical progressions like you can follow the various painting periods of Picasso.  You can connect the dots.  She's on a journey, and we're invited along if we choose to go.  I say, take the trip if you're feeling adventurous.
6304698690|5.0|The Secret Garden is a movie I watched as a child and even now I watch and love every moment of it.  This movie is by far the most accurate that I have seen, particularly the casting director's attention to description detail.  The acting by the children in this movie is impressive considering how young they are, their emotions freely expressed on screen when needed or bottled up to show the control they have over them.  The soundtrack is stunning as well, masterpiece of piano, guitar, and string instruments.  Sometimes it will be the same song used save for a different instrument playing the melody which changes the mood drastically from the others.  The settings as well are simply stunning and the director's use of light and shadow help to show the progress of Mary's love for the home and those in it.  The themes of the movie are clearly stated.  The acceptance of death and the remaining love that allows those left behind to heal, even if they didn't feel they needed healing at all.  A touch of magic which some have misinterpreted as witchcraft, which in reality is most Collin's desire for his father to stop running away from what he has.  A fantastic movie and worth watching over and over again.

B00005JKN9|4.0|Based on characters taken from Herbert Ashbury's book, The Gangs of New York, the film opens in 1845 with Amsterdam Vallon who witnesses the death of his gang leader father, The Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) at the hands of William 'Bill the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), the central figure in the naturalised, anti-immigrant America. Cut to some 16 years later and Amsterdam (DiCaprio) returns to his father's old stomping ground of Five Points, Lower Manhattan in a bid to seek vengeance on the man who killed his father.<br />As consistently violent a film as Scorsese has made, Gangs of New York is thankfully absent of romanticism when it comes to the natives of the hellish Five Points, and his view of the history of his city is honest and true. Daniel Day-Lewis, steels the show..........................

After a mysterious suicide, Officer Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) helps Constantine battle the forces of evil.<br /><br />A well-made and well-acted if not entirely faithful adaptation of the popular cult DC/Vertigo comic book \\"Hellblazer: John Constanstine\\". It's a mix of H.P. Lovecraft-esque horror, fantasy and action combined with some dazzling special effects and an intriguing story, the main character is quite a complex and tragic hero that shows us the way to hell and heaven in this movie.

B00000JHAU|4.0|This self-righteous, know-it-all, middle-aged, rock 'n' roll left over feels lucky to find one new band or artist every other year worth his time. I mean after the Beatles, Steely Dan, Allman Brothers, Hendrix, etc., etc., what's the point?  Well, yes, there's Weezer, Spoon and Rooney, but that's about it.    Then after a three-year dry spell, last spring as I often do, I innocently borrowed two interesting looking CDs--Electric Blue Watermelon by the North Mississipi Allstars and Dear Catastrophe Waitress by B&S--from the town library.  Suddenly, my cup ranneth over relevant to both.      \\"Step into My Office, Baby,\\" the geeky jazz kick off to \\"Waitress,\\" for example, told me I had found something special.  And I fell in love with about half of that sporadically inspired LP.    Then after checking out here what was recommended, I ordered \\"Sinister,\\" which took a while to appreciate after the slick production on DCW.  But now, wow!  \\"Fox in the Snow,\\" \\"Like Dylan,\\" \\"Mayfly,\\" and \\"Judy and the Dream of Horses,\\" are clasped to my bosom with hoops of steele!     Finally, people of taste and sensitivity, here's some great new stuff to explore. And I haven't felt so blissfully twee since Donovan!!
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Here's a bit about myself:I'm female, I have at least a semblance of a life, and am an intelligent, well-rounded individual. I've just started getting into star trek, being a 15 year-old nerd I guess it's doing absolutely nothing to break down stereotypes, but in my personal opinion Star Trek is just misunderstood. Not all fans go to ridiculous lengths dressing up and going to conventions and such. I enjoy star trek solely because I feel the characters are well developed, the acting is great (well, most of the time) and the very 60's effects and clothing styles are hilarious. Part of the allure, agreed upon by a friend who has also recently discovered the series, is that for a series set centuries into the future, it is so hopelessy outdated only 40 or 50 years later. I love the cheesy sets and lousy plots, I get the same enjoyment out of it I would watching a badly done 1950's horror film. It's a very special kind of love I hold for Star Trek, and encourage you to buy the series. It's worth watching.

B00005JO5L|4.0|The CRUISING (DELUXE EDITITON) dvd has restored the movie and soundtrack, but doesn't add anything new. According to the film's director, William Friedkin, over 40-minutes of additional footage was cut from the original movie and has since disappeared. And though he would have liked to include the 40+-minutes on this dvd, Friedkin says that he feels that the movie is complete as is.<br /><br />For those who aren't familiar with this movie, it's about a New York city cop (Pacino) who goes undercover in the S&M(Sado-masochism)/Leather subculture of the gay community looking for a serial killer who's targeting gay men. Even though he's a rookie, the cop is chosen for this assignment because he looks like most of the victims. The film is a gritty whodunnit and exposes an aspect of gay life that most will never see, and raises more questions than it answers. It can be very confusing at times and you never really know if the actual killer is caught; if the guy caught is the actual killer or if there's more than one.<br /><br />For those who are familiar with CRUISING, I just like to say that the porn frames are still in it. I thought that they would take them out because of the dvd transfer, but they didn't, which is good. The film looks sharp and there are some graphic enhancements that I don't remember being on the original video, but it doesn't take away anything from the movie.<br /><br />***Bonus Material***<br /><br />***Friedkin's commentary<br /><br />***Two featurettes that total about 45-minutes and include interviews with some of the actors from \\"Cruising,\\" along with Friedkin (Pacino is not on it), which also talks about the controversy and backlash from the gay commmunity<br /><br />***Theatrical trailer

B000TGQDZQ|4.0|I rarely give 5-stars (hence the 4-star rating I gave) but this is a very good album. On this, Epica's 3rd album, the songwriting, production, even Simone Simons singing has improved dramatically.     I also own Epica's first 2 albums, and while I think they are ok, they do not blow me away. Some of the songs on those are 'meh', some of the choir-sounding vocals are a bit hokey, Simones voice, while beautiful, still needs work, etc.    On this new album \\"The Divine Conspiracy', everything good about Epica's sound comes together. The difference between this album and their first 2 are like night and day.    If you like power/gothic/symphonic/etc. metal with female vocals (some male growling as well), you cant go wrong with Epica's 'The Divine Conspiracy'
B000R7HY0K|1.0|This movie stunk. I can't understand the \\"oh boy, character development\\" crowd...I'm fine with getting to know characters, if they're not silly and annoying. Just cause Quentin thinks that long monologues about pop culture (and anyone needs to discuss our pop culture for more than a second needs to get out more) are entertaining doesn't make it so.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the pathetic last 1/2 hour of Kill Bill 2, you might enjoy this.

B000093BDX|5.0|The Very Best of The Beach Boys: Sounds Of Summer gives us an incredible 30 (yes, 30) tracks on a single CD spanning several decades of the awesome career of The Beach Boys. This CD is perfect for the casual fan or for people who want to get to know The Beach Boys without springing for a more expensive CD or a set of CDs. People who want everything the band ever did will also want this CD in their collections.<br /><br />The track set begins with \\"California Girls.\\" They harmonize to perfection and the guitars work well for this number. \\"California Girls\\" celebrates the joys of young love and the band never misses a beat! \\"I Get Around\\" features the band singing really well with a terrific melody boasting key and tempo changes that show they're truly pros! \\"Surfin' Safari\\" also works well as The Beach Boys happily sing of going surfing with their girlfriends just off the sandy beach--great!<br /><br />\\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" showcases the joy we all feel when we're young and get our first taste of real freedom. \\"Fun, Fun Fun\\" has a great guitar arrangement; and they sing and harmonize flawlessly throughout this fine number. Love that organ, too! \\"Little Deuce Coupe\\" gives us a great tune about a young man's love for his car; and of course The Beach Boys deliver this without missing a beat! I like the percussion on \\"Little Deuce Coupe,\\" too. Moreover, \\"Be True To Your School\\" really brings back fond memories of junior high school dances. \\"Be True To Your School\\" sports a great melody with an upbeat melody to celebrate school pride and a sense of community we all felt with our classmates.<br /><br />\\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" highlights The Beach Boys singing of the universal human experience of longing for true freedom when we can live with our lovers without parental interference. This fine ballad gives us the band harmonizing as well as they ever did; and the drums enhance the natural beauty of \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\\" too. \\"Rock And Roll Music\\" picks up the tempo just a bit as the boys sings of how they want to dance with their girlfriends to some gold old fashioned rock and roll music. The backup chorus works well for \\"Rock And Roll Music;\\" and the band delivers this very well! I predict that you will enjoy \\"Rock And Roll Music\\" very, very much.<br /><br />\\"Barbara Ann\\" uses the name of a woman to evoke an image in each man's mind of the perfect girl for him; and this tune lacks nothing--it's THAT good. The \\"chatter\\" on this number conjures up images of a typical high school dance--great! In addition, \\"Heroes And Villains\\" really rocks well as The Beach Boys bat this one straight out of the ballpark! Listen also for \\"Kokomo,\\" a ballad dedicated to that perfect remote little island resort where we can all go with our lovers to have the ultimate romantic experience. \\"Kokomo\\" is a more recent hit for The Beach Boys; and this more than proves they never lost their style!<br /><br />\\"I Can Hear Music\\" again features great harmonizing and guitar; and the CD closes beautifully with their classic hit entitled \\"Good Vibrations.\\" The various tempo and key changes on \\"Good Vibrations\\" makes this number very, very special; and the passion a man feels for his woman gets expressed clearly with a stupendous musical arrangement. I again predict that you will like \\"Good Vibrations\\" very, very much. This is classic rock at its best!<br /><br />The liner notes include a great essay by Anthony DeCurtis; and we get the song credits, release dates and chart top positions for each song, too.<br /><br />The Beach Boys will always be remembered fondly for their excellent music; and their ballads dealt with so many universal emotions and experiences that their music remains timeless. Any Beach Boy fan will want this compilation to have their collections complete; and even though we get a few songs in mono the overall quality of the CD is so high that I will give this five stars anyway.<br /><br />Thank you, Beach Boys!ey want to dance with their girlfriends to some gold old fashioned rock and roll music.

0307387178|4.0|I bought this book because it was here at Amazon, and it caught my eye. I was able to read the book in about 2 days.<br /><br />I find the book really interesting, I don't like ruining anything, but its basically a young man who had a good upbringing, but it just wasn't his world. He left everything to find his happiness, and that he found.<br /><br />In certain parts of the book, it can be long-winded with all the comparisons made to other people. In essence, it helps us know our main character better, but sometimes, I just wanted to skip a couple of pages. (Which I didn't)<br /><br />So all in all. If you want a good story, which will be coming to movies shortly, this is a good read. Ha, and don't pay full price for it, you can get a cheap one here on Amazon.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|What a rip off!!! I recommend waiting right before Christmas when (you know it's going to happen) they come out with the double feature on one disc. It's just the studio's way of milking every nickle they can out of this film!!!
B00000JCB2|1.0|The debate over the genre of this album is unnecessary.  The truth is that this band, and album, were a fad.  They were worshiped when the deplorable era of rap/rock was constantly violating your ears. I honestly had no idea that people still took this band seriously.  I don't even think they take themselves seriously anymore.  I don't say this to flaunt any type of disdain for Fred Durst, who is considered to be your typical shoddy sell-out front man who just everyone loves to hate.  I say it because the music is just downright unpleasant.  To start, it's loud...in the obnoxious sense. It's incredibly juvenile, as anyone could deduce from reading the deep lyrics...And Fred Durst's singing/rapping (whatever you want to label it, if you can find a title for it.) just throws off my equilibrium.  I dont understand how anyone could tolerate his squeaky, high pitched \\"rapping\\", always followed by a low-pitched grumble that is most comparable to the Cookie Monster.    There really isn't anything redeemable from this band or this album.  Wes Borland's alleged talent is just a myth...I want to know how these Wes Boreland fans came to the conclusion that he was talented, because this talent is certainly not displayed on any Limp Biscuit albums.  All in all, this album really isn't worth your money.
006097625X|5.0|This book should be compulsory teaching in schools.  Very easy to read and a great education in not just comics, but also in art and story telling.  Highly recommended for everyone, even for the so called comic book experts.  I have been reading comics for over 20 years, and this taught me things I took for granted.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I had a great time playing with all the new extras. The cast commentary is especially fun.  If any studios are paying attention, it is about gorram time for a sequel, people!
B00005JPRF|3.0|I have no idea why this is the only one that wasn't released for critics. It's surprisingly well done even if it is Mad Max with zomibies. I'm sure Ebert & Roeper still would've ripped it apart but really not that bad at all. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is back and is one of the only living humans on earth. Everything is deserts now and of course there's tons and tons of zombies around. Alice and a group of other survivors led by Claire (Ali Larter of Heroes) and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr of the Mummy movies) fight to survive.<br /><br />  While underground scientists experiment and make clones of Alice for reasons I'm still not sure of lol. I'm not sure why the Statue of Liberty and eiffel tower are in Las Vegas in the film either unless there's replicars of them there that are unknown to me. Still though this is an enjoyable B-movie and Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter are both good at being tough chicks. Ali Larter has especially been in good Sarah Connor form since Heroes. She's actually pretty good as a tough chick in Heroes and here as well. This still isn't a fantastic movie but it's superior to the last two and if you expect an awful movie you might be surprised by it.
0393061434|5.0|It's Woz, how can you go wrong? I really enjoyed this book, although I would have enjoyed it a little more if Woz told more up-to-date stories. I know he has a ton, and I was really hoping to learn much more about Woz TODAY. Still, if you want to read about one of the most important people in Computer history, this is a good start.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|Thank god I only checked it out from the library. This is one of those movies that you could just stop watching halfway through and not care one bit what happens or how it ends. Why? Because the characters are not interesting. There's no hope or rooting for any of them. Also, Natalie Portman cannot act. It's almost painful watching her deliver her lines. Skip this movie.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|\\"When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.\\"  That's what it's all about.      This is IMO the finest horror film of the 20th Century, and I've watched a lot of them, believe me.  Also the finest George Romero has ever done.  If you have a strong stomach and an active mind, this movie is for you.  The only complaint I'd have is I've watched an unabridged version and seen a couple moments edited out of this one.  On the + side, there are a lot of interviews etc. on this version that are definite additions.    For those interested in a more literary sense, it's really an allegory comparable to Orwell's \\"Animal Farm,\\"  a story about American society and corruption resulting from greed.  It's also a period piece, inasmuch as its setting is the lone survivors of a plague take refuge in a shoppng mall, back when shopping malls were a new thing (imagine that!).    But if you don't care bout that literary mumbo-jumbo, the movie is still horrific and full of classic horror moments.  There is not a movie like this out there now, and not likely to be again, AFAIK.    --There is only one detractor to this DVD version worth mentioning, and it's a big one.  If possible you should definitely get the uncut version, ro perhaps an \\"editor's version\\" of this, since the \\"American Theatrical Release\\" version had small but significant parts censored.  They were mostly little parts portraying the government in a bad light, imagine that.
0792839749|5.0|I am very happy with my DVD purchases from Amazon.  The price was reasonable, they got delivered relatively quickly and the product quality is great.
B000VNMMRA|4.0|So it's a little hard to be consistent when rating a movie, as Siskel and Ebert used to argue.  Do you rate it according to whether it's a fine piece of filmmaking, or whether it succeeds in its purpose as just plain old entertainment of a certain sort?  I'm going for the latter this time.  \\"Live Free\\" is a kinetically charged hoot and holler of an action movie.  It's action scenes are vivid and real-looking, enough so to keep you tense in your seat much of the time.    Bruce Willis is the star, of course, playing laconic Detective John McClane, who during a routine pick-up of a computer geek finds himself in the midst of a plot to disrupt digital America.  The criminal mastermind portrays himself as a savior by showing America how vulnerable all of its computer networks are to hacking, by hacking and destroying them himself.   And hey, making a few billion himself as payment for services rendered.      McClane truly is a die-hard.  Nothing kills this guy, no matter how over-the-top the violence is.  He survives situations that even Wile E. Coyote would succumb to.  But the realism of the action makes it work anyway.  McClane nearly meets his match in the bad guy's girl friend, who shows that she can be bashed, mashed, smashed, and repeatedly crashed, and still be a fighting machine.  I wouldn't be surprised if she shows up in the next Die Hard movie--a simple SUV landing on top of her and exploding wouldn't be enough to stop this gal.  Terminator 3, eat your cyborgic heart out.    The plot is pure Hollywood Standard, borrowing heavily in this case from Schwarzenegger's \\"True Lies.\\"  McClane has a daughter who despises him,  having a family makes him vulnerable to the forces of evil, and sure enough the daughter is kidnapped, rescued, and now much more enamored of her daddy.  McClane even falls onto a fighter jet, just like the bad guy in \\"True Lies.\\"  Pretty standard stuff but spectacularly portrayed.     I hope that, for as over-dependent as we are on computers and related technology, we aren't as completely vulnerable to such a thing as the \\"fire sale\\" the movie portrays.  I didn't find it very reassuring that the good guys had as much access to everything as the bad guys did.  At least it was '70s technology that McClane was able to resort to to contact \\"Warlord\\" that helped save the day.  And naturally, McClane's good old violent ways.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|Seeing lots of complaining about \\"english dubbed\\" version.... Uh, folks.... this was shot in English due to the international cast, and the worst accents were dubbed over by voice actors in order to be better understood. Lots of Italian films did this. Why would an Italian language dub, where the lip movements and dialogue don't match be any better? At least Jessica Harper and Joan Bennett's real voices are heard in the English version! Relax everybody...

0345494997|4.0|This for me was a book that I have been waiting for. At present my library has over 40 books on Frank Lloyd Wright. I think that I therefore know quite a lot about him but the women in his life are almost shadows. I was really surprised at how thoroughly Ms Horan researched her subject. As an architect I felt that she understood architecture as Mamah must have and that you almost believed this to be a true biography. It was not over the top for effect but very real. I loved it and read it from cover to cover in two sittings, or should I say lie-ings, I was in bed. It now sits on the same shelf as my other FLW books, as it thoroughly deserves to. I wish that there were other books like this on the four women in his life. Great stuff and congratulations Ms Horan.
B000UFAURI|4.0|This album starts of strong but fades \\"Home\\"    Long Road to Ruin is a quality song. I can feel the pop in it and it is very catchy.   Pretender- Hard rocking song. Can't go wrong  Come Alive- What's going on here. Too mellow and too repetitive.  Stranger things have happened- I can play this on the guitar.  Cheer Up Boys- I actually like this song compared to other peoples reviews. This song stands out for me.  Statues- reminds me of A320 beginning. The piano sounds great in this song. We are just ordinary people you and me!  Home - Yawn, very sweet but enough with pianos in this song. Too depressing!    Conclusion:    The Foo Fighters still have it and they are one of the best Live Performers ever. They cross the gamit and not many can pull off an acoustic live album like Skin and Bones. I look forward to many more albums from them. I do with Taylor had a song he was singing on.
B000PY52EU|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for this movie I couldn't stop laughing. I had no idea what the movie was suppose to be about. All I saw was Samuel Jackson's character dragging Christina Ricci from a chain. It wasn't until I watched the movie from beginning to end that I realized it had a much deeper meaning behind it. Samuel L. Jackson's character, Lazarus, must overcome heartache after his wife leaves him for his brother. While Christina Ricc's character, Rae, is dealing with the loss of her boyfriend and some personal issues from her past. The two characters come together and ultimately redeem eachother. All of the actors in this movie are superb in their roles. Even Justin Timberlake was convincing. Just to give a fair warning, some of the scenes in this movie are very explicit. I've found that a lot of people are finding this movie very cheap and slightly offensive because of it's \\"rawness\\". I beg to differ. There is a great story here with real substance. I highly recommend it !!
B000GFLAI0|3.0|The music for Modern Times, although a little ragged around the edges and not as tight as it could be, is really very pleasant and quite enjoyable. I must say that I was extremely disapponted that the CD insert did not contain the words to the songs. I have listened to it numerous times, as has my family, and there are just a whole bunch of places that we can't even begin to figure out the lyrics. I'm sure Dylan has lots to say, and we've certainly tried to figure out what that might be, but just exactly how much of a treasure hunt do we have to go on here?

B000B5H6WY|5.0|Sylvia Plath was an incredibly bright, feeling person who was terribly disturbed by the ideas lurking in the dark corners of her mind.  I think that depression is something that befalls an extraordinary amount of brilliant artists.  (Some psychologists say depressed people have it right...which is...comforting when you are depressed but scary all the same.)  Through reading these words that Sylvia pressed to paper, you really get an idea of the sadness that plagued her and eventually led to her suicide.  She is a wonderful writer and you will feel inspired by her accomplishments as well as quite sorrowful for the life that was taken by a sickness that clearly wasn't treated.  Some people seem too intelligent for their own good and she is definitely one of them.<br /><br />Oh, and this book is labeled as fiction but it seems more like an autobiography that perhaps isn't totally accurate.
0618526412|5.0|An outstanding and realistic examination of the human condition. It's an indirect examination (\\"thoughts that wound from behind\\" as the great philosopher/storyteller Soren Kierkegaard put it) and that's what makes it so effective.  Everyone is so caught up in their own problems and acting out their desires that nobody notices the quiet suffering of the saintly central character. When he exits his void is felt yet no one can fathom the reasons for his disappearances. Maybe Jean Calvin was/is right about that thorough-corruption doctrine.  Carson McCullers sounds Kierkegaardian in showing the limits of organized religion and social action. The men of purposeful action (street preacher Simms, vagabond Jake Blount, and house-calling Doctor Copeland end up estranged, embittered, and feeling a lack of accomplishment. Meanwhile, the non-formalists (John Singer, Mick Kelly, and Biff Brannon) are better-adjusted and seem to have done more for the world. McCullers doesn't forget the \\"middle path\\" either by giving us Portia Copeland, a decent and generous church-goer who talks a little too much.  Our author echoes the sentiments of fellow Southerner William Faulkner on the civil rights issue. Both McCullers and Faulkner despaired at the suffering of blacks under Jim Crow but were wise enough to know the situation could not be legislated away (after all Jim Crow was a creation of government too.) Racism is a human failing to see The Other as a fellow child of G-d. It's an animalistic impulse, as Rabbi Daniel Lapin (a teacher of mine) rightly points out. Trying to speed the undoing of this impulse through legislation and protest marches, while not completely unhelpful, risks bloodshed. Having the faith/attributes of Biff (who runs a restaurant/hospitality center in the spirit of Biblical patriarch Abraham, the father of faith), Mick and Singer makes peaceful change possible in time.  Doctor Copeland and Jake Blount foreshadow the professional protestors of our era. Their enjoyment in physical confrontations tells us a good bit about the psyche of poverty pimps and union thugs.  Singer's life shows the truth of what another of my teachers (the saintly Rabbi Avigdor Miller ZT\\"L) once said -- \\"It is the quiet man that is respected.\\" The public activist hero portrayed in Hollywood and TV news misleads many into thinking that they must pour forth a constant stream of verbiage to make an impact and promote \\"understanding.\\" Rabbi Miller and other sages know better -- Most talking is counterproductive.  McCullers (who was 23 at the time \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" was published) proves herself the Great American Prophetess of the Great American Loneliness. Widespread ambivalence and inarticulateness amid the Information Age and cell-phone-driven communications \\"revolution\\" wouldn't have surprised Carson McCullers.  To close, here's a gem -- \\"He (Biff) had known his loves and they were over. Alice, Madeline, and Gyp. Finished. Leaving him either better or worse. Which? However you looked at it.\\"
B00005JLCI|5.0|Until just recently I had never seen or read any production of Hamlet in any form. In high school I had read other plays such as Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth, but never got around to what many consider to be William Shakespeare's signature work. I'm glad I waited though, and I'm glad my first exposure was Kenneth Branagh's lavishly complete and definitive four-hour version. I've seen a couple of other versions of Hamlet since, but after having seen Branagh's first, it's hard for me to go back.    The fact that this version includes the full text means there's enough time to properly flesh out the story and thoroughly explore important characters and their motivations, things critical to the full appreciation of the story and sorely missed when absent. The acting is exceptional and the highlight of the film, with each performance given it's due time. Kenneth Branagh, seen here in a signature role, has full freedom to show his breadth and focus as an actor, as well as his talent as an accomplished director. He balances his own ego and grand persona by channeling it through the character of Hamlet, whose own madness and ego are two dominant driving forces in his actions. Here the effect of Branagh's ego is a calculated action that serves to reinforce the motivations of the character, not to overburden or dilute it; a choice well made.      It's truly wonderful to see an actor stretch this much, and to watch someone with the capability of doing so. And while the production clearly knows who the star is and Branagh's performance is duly highlighted, it's the supporting cast which deserves the credit for reinforcing his own interpretation of the source material and what gives the film its overall strength. Just as Branagh is rightly given center stage to ply his craft, the acting and actors are the dominant focus of this production. With supporting players including Derek Jacobi, Richard Briers, Julie Christie and small, but good cameos by Billy Crystal, Jack Lemmon and Sir Richard Attenborough, the film succeeds not only as a brilliant character portrait, but as an efficient and engaging ensemble piece as well.    In its first appearance on DVD, the film transfer on this disc looks great. I'm happy to say that I was soundly impressed with this standard-def disc in an age of \\"fancier\\" HD releases. Picture clarity, color balance and audio are all spot on in this 2-disc version, and with an ample supply of extras, it's truly the complete version of this film.    Shakespeare knew how to entertain audiences just the way Branagh does with his interpretation of Hamlet, which delivers his own unique vision to our own age as both actor and director. Few play-to-film productions are as lavish and meaty as this one, and as a result few are as satisfying. Expertly put together and impeccable produced, I highly recommend this version without any hesitation for anyone, Shakespeare fan or not, who enjoys a good story told well.

B00005JPKE|5.0|Remember all those war in the Pacific movies, with our men charging ashore? This is the flip side. The defenders are the Japanese. Recently, letters from those defenders of Iwo Jima in World War II were unearthed in a cave, unmailed. Then the movie flashes back to the war. The letters home furnish much of the story. Ordinary Japanese conscripts are  stationed on this god-forsaken island. This is a sympathetic movie about them. They know the Americans are coming. They have to. They don't know when. They hope reenforcements are coming. But they also know they are going go die. Hopefully they will do so with honor. In so many ways they are just guys like our men with their petty gripes about the food, the waiting around, their fool superior officers etc. American soldiers want to live but many will die. Japanese choose death over defeat & that is the big difference. I felt for their plight as many did kill themselves during the battle. However, there was a glimmer of hope. Several of their officers had been to America before the war. Their exposure to our culture convinced them there might be another way. An extraordinarily good World War II movie & kudos to the fine performances & direction of Clint Eastwood & his associates.

B000OVLBF8|4.0|Even way back during my comic-collecting days, I never really crossed paths with Ghost Rider (I've read exactly one issue), and I only decided that I like Nicolas Cage after all about a year ago - so I wasn't exactly waiting for this film (and what a lengthy wait it turned out to be) with baited breath.  You know what, though?  I really enjoyed this movie.  OK, the first half hour is a little slow and boring, but once the actual Ghost Riding starts, the action makes up for the deficiencies in the storyline.  I can't say the whole flaming skull thing looks like it could even possibly be real, but it's still a flaming skull, and that is, by definition, pretty darn cool.  And we all know that you can't really go wrong with demon fighting.<br /><br />If you know nothing about Ghost Rider, here's all you really need to know.  As a teenager, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) sold his soul to the devil (but not for greedy or selfish reasons) - only to be totally screwed over by the evil-doer.  Knowing that old Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) could show up at any time to enforce his end of the deal, Blaze leaves the love of his life behind and heads out to lead a life of relative isolation.  Following in his father's footsteps, he becomes a famous motorcycle daredevil, continually upping the danger ante in an effort to prove to himself that he, not Mephistopheles, is responsible for his success.  Life goes on until the day he jumps the length of a football field (goalpost to goalpost, which would actually be 20 yards further than the 100 yards described in the film).  As fate would have it, Blaze's death-defying jump actually pales in importance to two other things that happen: this is the day that Blaze's young sweetheart, Roxanne (Eva Mendes), suddenly comes back into his life, and it is also the day that Mephistopheles decides to show up and put his reluctant bounty hunter to work for the first time.  Turning into a flaming skeleton consumed with the overwhelming need to punish evil-doers doesn't do much for romance, especially when it happens every night.  Ghost Rider's targets aren't exactly easy to kill, either, because they are a group of demons led by Mephistopheles' rebellious son Blackheart (Wes Bentley).  Father and son are both after the old contract for a thousand exceedingly corrupt souls a former Ghost Rider hid away from the devil's evil clutches.<br /><br />Once Blaze transforms into Ghost Rider, some heavy CGI work is used to tell most of the rest of the story.  None of the special effects will make your jaw drop open, but it's all pretty effective for the most part.  That whole romance thing butts in from time to time to take away from all of the demonic action, but even the plot's predictability in this regard does little to take away from the overall entertainment factor.  You especially have to love Ghost Rider's trademark finishing move, the Penance Stare.<br /><br />I know the reaction to Ghost Rider has been a little on the mixed side, but I for one am glad to hear that there are plans for a sequel in the works.  In terms of plot and characterization, this film does leave itself open to various levels of criticism, but Ghost Rider is a great character that could easily sustain a franchise of films.ers doesn't do much for romance, especially when it happens every night.

B000UR366S|5.0|The instrumentation is wonderful and sparse, the words are heartfelt and more serious than most popular music dares to go. Joni Mitchell does not want to ruminate these days on trivial pursuits. Ecology, politics and egoism dominate as themes. Even with the serious nature of her lyrics the music floats and inspires with luminous beauty. Wayne Shorter's saxophone underscores and punctuates her compositions adding to the symbiosis of poetry and music. Joni's dark, sultry voice reaches deep into her own heart and so into the heart of anyone willing to let go and be part of the experience.     \\"If I Had a Heart\\" ranks as one of her finest compositions. That, along with \\"Night of the Iguana\\" and \\"If\\" are themselves worth the price of the album.    I was impressed to see that most of the instrumentation was done by Mitchell and it does not disappoint, but I would love to hear this music live and with a cadre of the fine musicians she is always able to conscript.     I give \\"Shine\\" my highest recommendation.

075640407X|4.0|Starts well, but bogs down in the middle. The precocious (precious?) child was tolerable while I was hoping for the story to get started. Eventually I just got tired of the self-congratulatory whinging as accompaniment to the growth pangs of the teenage genius. It does get a little better if you can hang on long enough. I'm hoping that the next book is leaner amd better.
0439813786|5.0|I was attracted to this book by its cover.  They say you can't tell a book by its cover but this book is one good exception.  Because in addition to the wonderful graphic quality of the jacket, the book is full of fine and artful illustrations through which much of the tale is told.  I felt like a kid again flipping through the pages and seeing the story unfold, and then there would come some exposition in text and then more of the wonderful drawings that reminded me very much of Seurat's beloved black and white charcoal sketches.  I look forward to sharing copies of this book with my friends.
0316926345|5.0|This is written by Arthur Evelyn St. John Waugh  (1903 to 1966) a British writer best known for this present work and the following novels: Decline and Fall, A Handful of Dust, and The Sword of Honour trilogy. I read A Handful of Dust a few months ago and thought that the present book had more in it, i.e.: longer and a more interesting read, and it had a more realistic plot. According to what we know, Waugh had a few second thoughts about the present book.<br /><br />The story is really three stories that are separated in time which have been pieced together. It is set in post WWI England and it is about the protagonist and narrator Charles Ryder, a student at Oxford University college and his encounter with members of the Flyte family at Brideshead. The novel contains descriptions of his life as a student and then folllows through ten years or so into his adult life and his marriage.<br /><br />I will try and not give away the plot but give a quick sketch. The three pieces or sub-plots are his relationship with Sebastian Flyte, then Julia Flyte his sister, and then finally Lord Marchmain, an Anglican, converted to his wife's religion which is Roman Catholicism.<br /><br />Each of the three sub-plots has a different slant to the story. The relation with Sebastian is similar to an Oscar Wilde situation, and the reader is left in doubt to the extent of the relationship. Is it physical or platonic? Also, the author brings in the subject of alcoholism. Finally, that first section gives us a glimpse of life at Oxford post WWI.<br /><br />The central to last part of the novel with Julia is a more conventional love story, and then at the end we have the theme of divine grace and reconciliation of the father.<br /><br />Most people focus on the theme of Catholicism, and I thought that theme was rather weak until the last ten pages or so. One can suspect that the author has taken this approach so as not to isolate the audience early in the novel. We can assume the audience for the novel is not Catholic.<br /><br />Does it work? As a simple novel or as an entertaining work of art it works and the novel is interesting; it is ingenious and is a compelling read after the first 40 pages or so.<br /><br />As an advertisement for the Catholic faith I am less sure that the book works but the reader can judge.<br /><br />Recommend: 5 stars.t work?

0385486804|4.0|I read this book when it first came out because I like Krakauer's style.  I felt like I read a different book than others who were mesmerized by this young man setting off on an incredible adventure, finding himself and the meaning of life.  Sorry.  It seemed evident to me that young Chris was in the throes of schizophrenia which, typically, strikes in the early 20s.  I didn't feel impressed or inspired by this story but sorry that someone did not intervene to save Chris's life.
0061120073|5.0|This is the kind of book where there is no interwoven complex plot - just life, death, marriage, sacrifice and lessons learned.  It's these simple writings that sometimes touch us the most and are the most thought-provoking.  A girls life from childhood into womanhood, and all the dreams and devastations in between... Excellent.
B000TGELLY|3.0|I thought the original was an okay film, if you know your history and read the books. If not you'll be wondering 'what did I miss?' In fact the original movie did leave out some parts/details and this dvd fills in the void. To me, I didn't like the score being changed and it took away from the film then added to it. But hey, thats what the additional footage was for. They removed some of the original footage and replaced it. In temple scene, it looked like BP was taking a dump in the corner. Personally they shouldn't of changed that part b/c I raised an eyebrow when I saw it siince it looked rather funny.XD Other then that, its an okay dvd to have if you have an open mind a/o enjoy epic war films, Which ever it may be. ^_^

B000UO338W|4.0|Can it be true?  Is this really the last we'll ever hear from Al Jourgensen and Ministry?  Let's hope not, but if indeed it is, \\"The Last Sucker\\" is a heck of a way to go out.  Completing the politically charged assault trilogy that started with \\"Houses of the Mole\\" and continued with last year's \\"Rio Grande Blood\\", \\"The Last Sucker\\" is a nitro fueled blast of raw industrial mayhem, which is nothing less than we should come to expect from good 'ol Uncle Al.  \\"Watch Yourself\\", \\"No Glory\\", \\"Die in a Crash\\", the title track, and the creepily closing \\"End of Days\\" are some of the best material that Ministry has produced in the past three years, and the blazing cover of the Doors' \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" is simply a treat to the ears.  \\"The Last Sucker\\" closes with Al once again making excellent use of an old speech, which in itself is a fond farewell to the fans that have stuck by Ministry through thick and thin over what is close to thirty years that the band has been around.  If indeed this is the end of Ministry, it's been a great ride to say the least, and they will forever be known as one of the most original and influential outfits to ever hit the scene.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|This album is similar to Book of Secrets, but still manages to be different. I think I'm addicted. The thing is, whenever I have an album of hers playing--whether it be at work, in the car, at home--and I have company around, they always ask me \\"Who is this? I love it!\\" They think the music is from India, the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, or Eastern Europe. But no, I tell them, this music hails from Canada! And that's that. I find this album just as inspiring as Book of Secrets and the other albums I have. This one is less Celtic and more Middle Eastern in tone and complexity. I enjoy listening to it while I'm studying, writing, or practicing yoga. Check it out, and check out Book of Secrets while you're at it. They're similar...but different.
B00005JPTA|3.0|'Eastern Promises' is essentially a story about a Russian crime family in London, and how their lives intertwine with a British midwife and her family. The film is dark and plodding, and it seems to give a realistic look into the underworld Russian culture of the \\"vori v zakone.\\" These are scary guys.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say I wasn't as thrilled about this film as the previous reviewers seem to be. I won't say it's a bad film, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't walk out of the theater disappointed. The premise is an interesting one; a young Russian mother dies during childbirth, leaving only the baby and a diary behind. The midwife (Watts) takes the diary and decides to track down the girls family so she can give them the baby. The diary, written in Russian, contains some incriminating evidence about some local Russian thugs, who ironically is exactly who Watts takes the diary to for translation. This obviously leads to some interesting drama as the two sides feel each other out and become entangled in a dark and unusual relationship. This is juxtaposed with the story of Nikolai (Mortensen) trying to earn his way into the family by proving his loyalty and obedience. Nikolai is an interesting character who is not exactly who he seems to be, and his revelation toward the end of the film did catch me by surprise.<br /><br />The acting was generally good, most notably Mortensen as Nikolai, the Russian boss (Mueller-Stahl) and Cassel as the brutish yet jovial and child-like Kiril. The cinematography was also good, creating a rich visual backdrop for the film. One of the main weaknesses in my view was the dialogue. While there were a few decent lines, and some good dark humor, there were a few scenes where I was left shaking my head at the inanity of the script. Overall, I just felt generally dissatisfied with the film. I can't really even give a specific reason, but the film just had a sort of vague and incomplete feeling to it, which is not helped by an incredibly anti-climactic ending. I don't know, perhaps it was just too \\"nuanced\\" for my thick head, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it. Worth checking out, I suppose, but in my opinion, nothing spectacular.ending.

B000W4HJ44|5.0|I just want to tell you that this movie totally blew me away in the theatres!!! I went into the theatre with low expectations, because I hated the original! This movie has everything a good musical should great acting, great music, and lots of flash and color! This movie has great performances from all of the stars! John Travolta does an excellent job of playing a woman! Queen Latifah, Michell Pffifer, and Christopher Walken are all equaly as funny! Zac Efron, Britany Snow, Amanda Bynes, and newcomer Nikki Blonsky all give top notch perfomances also!<br /><br />Now the music! This show has the greatest music ever in a movie musical in my opinion. Every song in the movie blew me away! From the inspirational opening number \\"Good Morning Baltimore\\" to the finale slam dunk \\"You Can't Stop The Beat\\". The other songs are also great. The solo numbers really showed off some of the actors as great singers such as \\"Ladies Choice\\" performed by Zac Efron, \\"Miss Baltimore Crabs\\" perfomed by Michelle Pffifer, and \\"Big, Blonde, and Beautiful\\" performed by Queen Latifah!!
B000TGCR38|5.0|As many here have said, this is a beautifully shot, gripping, unforgettable movie, a great addition to the honorable genre of WWII flicks.  In fact, the father of one of my colleagues, Dutch himself and in his 70s, said this was the best film he has ever seen.  So I don't understand why, if a man in his 70s who is from the WWII generation himself did not find this film \\"prurient,\\" so many reviewers have insisted that it is.  The scene that most of the prudes seem to find gratuitous is (spoiler alert) the scene in which the Jewish heroine prepares herself to pass as a blonde bombshell so she can seduce the German officer.  Clearly, she is going to have to dye or shave hair other than the hair on her head in order to pass as a natural blond.  The movie shows her doing this.  Why is it not gratuitous?  Because the scene sets up the love triangle that will result in the conflict in the last third of the movie.  It is absolutely essential to the advancement of the plot, and in my opinion, any reviewer who can't see that is not only a fussy old woman, but also not much of a reviewer.  So if you have not seen this movie because you've read a review that trashes it on the grounds of prurience, please reconsider.  And consider this:  the most recent Ang Lee movie is so sexually frank that it got an NC-17 rating, yet there hasn't been a single review which has trashed it on the basis of its gratuitous sex.  That says to me that some major reviewers are only interested in criticizing Paul Verhoeven rather than commenting honestly on his film.  Another reason to see this movie is Carice Van Houten.  She not only convincingly plays a 40's bombshell, she has that same 40s movie-star quality that you can't take your eyes off of.  Truly, you could watch this film 100 times and never get tired of her.  She is irresistible.
0143038419|1.0|\\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is an almost perfect embodiment of everything wrong with America circa 2007, so it's fitting that such a tome has been so widely and indiscriminately embraced by aspirational post-yuppie women. An unabashed emissary of the culture of selfishness and the cult of the individual, our protagonist decides to dump her husband and \\"just take a year off,\\" indulging in noncommittal and shallow adventures entirely divorced from any greater sense moral, ethical, or intellectual purpose. Forget that there's an illegal, undeclared war that's resulted in the deaths of thousands upon thousands of innocents, forget all people living a subsistence existence, forget all the people that have to work for a living - she's \\"just gonna take some time out for me.\\" Remember when that meant simple and humble pleasures, rather than a year of non-working and unthinking vacation as lifestyle, with a little fake religion and fake nonthreatening indulgence thrown in?     Elizabeth Gilbert is the herald of a new age of crass, unthinking American indulgence and excess, truly a new low for humanity at large. When the next 9/11 happens, it will be because of people like Gilbert, living blissfully unaware of the the way that the rest of the world views their lifestyles, mentality, and condescending market/tourist mentality toward everything not in their backyard. \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is why they hate our freedom.

0393324818|5.0|First off, this is not a book by Billy Beane, or anyone in the Oakland Athletics organization.  This is a look at the use of Sabermetrics in baseball, originally thought up by Bill James, and how it can be used to help evaluate talent, and give you an edge in an unfair game, as the title states.<br /><br />Reading this book, whether you are a casual or avid baseball fan, gives you a whole new look at the game of baseball, the way it is played, and the way teams are run. It breaks away from the norm, and shows that it is not the size of the payroll you have on your team, but how you use the money you have.  Also, it is set a few years back, and it mentions some of the players that were scouted and drafted by Beane and his staff.  It is nice now to read it, and see how these players have panned out.<br /><br />Again, great book, flows very well, and I would recommend that if you are even a little interested, you pick this book up in a second.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|As a big Tarantino fan and a gear head, I was looking forward to this, thinking it would be a slick and exciting car chase movie.  Then I started watching the film, and what I saw was a two hour movie that was an hour and forty five minutes of filler and fifteen minutes of an average car chase.  The scenes of dialogue between the victims, and later on the heroines, drag on forever with absolutely no plot building (mostly because there is no plot to build in the first place), and when the scenes with the cars finally roll around they just aren't worth the wait.  And what's more, at the end of the movie I was actually feeling sorry for the villain.  Yes, Stuntman Mike killed four girls in the movie and tried to kill three more, but the heroines were just so slimy (I actually felt like taking a shower after their dialogue scenes).  All that being said, Death Proof might have been a decent movie if it was a half hour shorter.

It zips along, has a lot of suspense, some thrills, and a nice \\"video\\" of the Frankie Goes To Hollywood hit \\"Relax.\\"  But what's never made any sense to me is the plot -- what is the necessity of setting this guy up to view the murder in the first place?  Who needs him?  Am I missing something?  A fun ride nevertheless. -- Don't have the DVD, so I can't say anything about the extras, but I would appreciate a commentary from the director which I understand it doesn't have.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|While this is her third (or fourth; depends on what to count) album and her previous two had some very memorable singles, this release is better in that it is the most rocking of the three. The first two had too much \\"Britney Spears\\" feel to them; this one has significantly less of those candy pop queen aspirations, and good riddance! From the very first track, Seasons Change, the album rocks with several very good tunes; lots of hooks! Then it comes to a terrific power ballad Heavy On My Heart. Pretty Little Dum Dum is lyrically pretty standard for today's grrrrrl rock but it is still very catchy (although going a bit funny with its feminine anger). Hopefully, there will be another album like this soon, and then a Best Of compilation... how about that?
006085880X|4.0|This was the first Jodi Picoult book that I had read and I was overall very pleased.  It is the type of book, that is extemely hard to put down. The book's set up makes the reader feel as if he or she is a detective, trying to gather clues to figure out the case. The characters in the book are the type people, one would run into on a daily basis, making the book easy to relate to. Although, I did enjoy reading the book, I was extremely dissappointed by the ending.  I felt as though Picoult left the reader hanging with more questions and I wanted more answers.  Overall, I would suggest this book to anyone who is looking for a book that keeps one's attention, and likes the aspect of trying to figure out a crime.
B00004W50Z|5.0|Critics labeled this as \\"good, but not as good as the first two\\" and many fans agree. I completely disagree with such an idea, and I believe this album is completely uncomparable to the first two.    This album, as it has been described many times before, is purely a confessional piece of work, said nervously and memorably. Manuel, Danko and Helm have all been abusing drugs like there is no end, and leave the writing to Robertson, who writes all tracks except for the two Manuel contributions and the Helm contribution, both of which Robertson co-wrote. For just this feat, Robertson deserves a 5 star rating for quality songwriting.    For the first time, since the Band's inception, Robertson, the de-facto leader of the Band, becomes an upfront guitarist, bringing many pieces of great songs like Just Another Whistle Stop and Time to Kill into memorable classics in the Band catalogue.    Another first in the Band catalogue, is that the three main singers of the Band do not attempt to add their harmonies whenever they can. The three part Danko-Helm-Manuel harmony suddenly dissapeared from tracks and was no longer a main part of The Band sound.    Two of my favorite Band songs have come out of this album, namely the beautiful waltz Sleeping and the Rumor, which contains one of the greatest musical breakdowns in my Band collection. Sleeping contains soulful Richard Manuel chords and vocals, with great guitar work, bass work and energy, bringing the song upfront, and making it very memorable. The Rumor, with its great vocal interplay between Helm and Danko, has an instrumental break around 2:40 which gives me chills. The arrangment is funky and well chosen, and has more memorable Robertson guitar work.    The only bad song on the album is Strawberry Wine. Through any official story, Helm sang this song, the first time released to the public, while under the influence of heroin, and offers a very worn out vocal performance. The track was \\"amazingly played in one take,\\" whichfrom the muddled sound to the unsure playing, makes it the worst on the album.     The rest of the songs are of the highest quality (except one): All La Glory is a beautiful, country blue-tinged piece that Robertson wrote about the birth of his child. The Shape I'm In is an \\"in your face\\" confession which is funky and has great Manuel vocals, as well as good examples of how to play a Fender Rhodes. Time To Kill is an upbeat song about boredom, which is definitely not boring and worth many listens. Just Another Whistle Stop has great guitar breaks, fine bass playing and superb vocals. The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show is an upbeat rocker which has been played too many times on my cd player, whilest Stage Fright delivers one of Danko's best vocal performances in his career. Daniel And the Sacred Harp has beautiful Autoharp work, fuels their country Americana image, has great lyrics and good vocal interplay.    This album is a must in any music fan's collection and is worth every penny!

B000784WMW|5.0|I found this movie to be the best Jane Eyre I've seen. It was close to the book and enjoyable to watch at the same time. Zelah Clarke made a good Jane. She looked too old to be eighteen but she was so short that when she stood next to Rochester she looked young enough to be his daughter. To me Timothy Dalton was a perfect Rochester. He met most of the qualifications, besides being handsome and green eyed. But if you think about it, he might not have been considered handsome in mid-victorian England. So he might have been dead on! He was gruff but you could see he was \\" pervious, through a chink or two still\\". Another plus, they finally had a BLACK HAIRED BLANCHE! Most versions I've watched or have seen reliable clips of, have a blonde, which annoys me cosiderably. Also, they had a black and white Pilot. It wasn't a newfoundland but black and white none the less. I was also happy with the gypsy scene, which many versions change considerably or leave out altogether. It also handled her time with the Rivers well and acurately.   Many Jane Eyre enthusiast might disagree with me, but I think this movie is the absolute best. Definately money well spent!

B000UR366S|5.0|On first listen: sparse & minimal. By the third listen: WOW! there's a lot of layers here! And again, Joni is doing horn arrangements without the actual horns (like she did on Harlem in Havana).     Including Big Yellow Taxi (2007) I guess just states: \\"I said this thirtysome years ago & things have just gotten worse\\".    The heart of the album which it all revolves around is Hana -- the counter-message to the rest of the album: \\"Pull up your sleeves and do your part to help out\\".    One thing Joni: After a few albums now, that soprano sax twittering around you is starting to get annoying. Next album a new complementary instrument will be welcome.    Otherwise: This album is so-O welcome and nothing has diminished about this great artist.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I wanted to dislike this movie so bad, but I can't. It is a colorful, lighthearted tale of clueless class bozo Napoleon and his adolescent tribulations- attempting romance and supporting his equally weird friend Pedro.  Idaho, the films location is a beautiful state and appears almost surreal as a backdrop to the sufferable antics of Napoleon, his geek brother and scheming uncle as they try to live under the same roof when Napoleons guardian is temporarily hospitalized. The film is so light hearted that  it challenges our own minds in what to expect next, in many instances I found myself misinterpreting the intentions of the strange group of characters, usually they ended up being far better people than I expected.  Jon Heder might have drained his whole talent pool on this, I will find it hard to see him as anyone but this well put together title role. Tina Majorina is great as one of the group of kids you can't help but want to laugh at sometimes, but shines like the sun and shows so much heart it's hard not to love.
B000SQJ27I|5.0|Unlike the other 3 albums by Manu Chao, La Radiolina took me a few listening to get used too. The good thing about this album is that (once again) even if you don't understand all the lyrics, the pleasure is throughout the entire ride. I highly recommend getting this album as well as all his 3 other albums. He is defiantly a very talented musician (and political too, by the way).  ENJOY!!
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Casting the romantic comedy...Cameron Diaz? Check. Jude Law? Check. Kate Winslet? Double Check. Jack Black? WTF?  I love Jack Black, but he's seriously out of place here.  Even he doesn't appear to believe he's in the right place.<br /><br />Moreover, you could drive large Caterpillar trucks through the holes in Nancy Meyers' script.  Like how these two ladies actually swapped their houses despite Diaz's character happening upon the web site that very day.  Or, Winslet's character referring to some manual that Diaz's character put together covering the intense electronics in the house...despite the fact the Diaz's character left town in an unplanned state of frenzy.  Or Eli Wallach's character finally agreeing to be feted by his screenwriting peers, then suddenly having the very formal event held like one week later.  There's a long list of \\"doesn't work\\" things like that.<br /><br />Despite all that, what can I say - Cameron Diaz is a gifted physical comedienne in the classic Hollywood screwball blonde sort of way, I'd watch Kate Winslet in anything, and Jude Law always looks great on the screen...he's what a movie star ought to be.  And Nancy Meyers - my comments above aside - is someone worthy of respect with her hard work, creativity, vision and success in a male-dominated industry.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|Yep, as everyone's already said, 5 long years have 'crawled' by since the last Down album, and Over the Under has been one of the most anticipated records of the year if not decade. So... does it live upto expectations? Of course! After hearing a live version (on video) of I scream way back in March, i knew this was going to be big. This is a mammoth album. Heavy, groovy and you can tell that they've spent a lot of time writing this material. Its very personal. The band also seemed to have improved by leaps and bounds in terms of musicianship.Bower Power for example, just blew me away on this. Awesome control, fills and execution on the kit. The songs, without exaggerating almost all of the track are stand out; NOD, 3 suns, Path, Nothing in return, On march the saints, I scream, Pillamyd... absolutely awesome. The tracks on this album are all instantly catchy, which is a good thing, where as II was more of a grower. I'm just glad Down is back... you can feel the pain, the anguish in this record... takes you down to New Orleans. Down Rocks. 5 stars. NOD and Pillamyd are absolutely brutal! Awesome!
B000UGG39Q|4.0|Check it out, this is so simple.  If you like good \\"stoner rock\\" you'll love this!  Good riffs, good lyrics, good stuff.
B000TGCR3I|4.0|Firstly, don't be fooled by the lighthearted cover.  This isn't a children's movie.<br /><br />Secondly, it takes a bit of time to get used to.  The backgrounds are gorgeous and rivals the detailing of the best of Disney.  But the character rendering reminded me of the old Nickelodeon animated series, \\"The Wild Thornberrys\\" which is to say, the character designs are very unique.<br /><br />Thirdly, the opening 30 minutes is slow going and somewhat confusing.<br /><br />But give it some time and then the story of Kuro and Shiro starts to really come together.<br /><br />This is a fable of sorts in which the dark and the light need each other but one doesn't have to get too philosophical to get the message.<br /><br />I agree with the previous reviewer who mentions the side story of Kimura.  That is one of the nice touches.  I'd also add the interaction of the cops, Sawada and Fujimura, with Shiro as another nice touch.<br /><br />I gave it 4 starts because there is a wait time before it gets to the grist of the story and I stopped watching the clock.  But once I got past that point, I got into the story and by the end, I'd found that I enjoyed it a lot.

B000AU9UYM|4.0|I had a hard time getting used to this movie at first... they re-wrote the batman back story to fit this movie, and a few other continuity goofs (with the batman back story, like the dates) but after a while, I realized this was an UPDATE to the story. Then I began to really like it, and let go of the old story, and accept it for what it is
B00005BKZJ|5.0|We have always enjoyed this movie. Its values hold true over the years. The acting is excellant and the story is timeless. People can and do pull together when under stress. We may need a reminder from time to time, maybe this film should be re-released into theaters.

The track labled \\"No More Cloudy Days\\" here on the \\"Live From Melbourne\\" DVD, will be included in this upcoming CD release.

B000UFAURI|4.0|A lot of people are saying this is their best album since There's Nothing Left to Lose. Fair enough. But I've only given this album three listens and I've giving TNLTL hundreds. I remember the first time I heard that album and being a bit disappointed that it wasn't Colour and the Shape 2. This album sounds good. The rock songs sound more \\"classic rock\\" or as a friend of mine describes the Foos, \\"straight ahead rock n' roll.\\" A couple of the softer songs feature a lot of the band that took part in the acoustic tour, which I was a big fan of. I pre-ordered the iTunes version which came with a couple bonus tracks and supposedly will give me access to Foo tour pre-order.    Here's a Foos thing: With the exception of TCatS, I would have rated each album one star lower prior to seeing them perform it live. They put on an amazing show. Here's hoping that continues for many more albums and tours.
1844137872|5.0|a great piece of urban art history.  Not only is this book filled with an enormous amount of big colorful pictures, it also has some great writing.  I didn't realize Banksy was so witty.<br /><br />Truly a must have for any fan of Banksy or anyone interested in street art.
B000MTDRKE|3.0|I love Neal-era Spock's Beard and I love Testimony and One, but (while it is still good) Sola Scriptura does not live up to Neal's previous works or the hype surrounding it. Musically it is much more one-dimensional than previous albums and lyrically the album does not tell its story as well as some of Neal's other works.     I'm hopeful that next time around Neal will listen to Mike Portnoy's advice and make an album of stand alone songs, rather than another concept album.    On the plus side, Paul Gilbert's guitar work is brilliant.
073933235X|5.0|Loved this raunchy rip of a tour through the world of (upscale) restaurant meal creation.  And what a view it is of the unique characters who wield chef's knives!  Bourdain is a great writer as well as obviously a superior/successful chef, and to top it off, his baritone voice is perfect for the audio format....great inflection, drama, humor.
B000P0J024|5.0|This has got to be the best CD I have heard in a while. The DVD is so cool to watch - but ya gotta like the old \\"what music is supposed to be about\\" music!!! ENJOY
B000002J1S|5.0|I love this album!  It is my favorite album overall and showcases the many talents of Genesis back in 1974. I cannot believe it is 33 years old! I am not sure how it would be perceived by modern audiences, but the mix of instruments, use of minor chords with their infusion of disharmony, heavy percussion, Peter Gabriel's distinctive voice, and the most unusual lyrics that tell the story of Rael make for a very compelling two CDs.  Genesis was an extremely talented band and each of their CDs is a mini-masterpiece, with \\"Lamb\\" being the most shining example of them all.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I knew this DVD would be great, but I had no idea it would be brilliant!  As much as I liked Pulse, I like this show much better.  I think I may have watched Echoes 20 times since I bought it.  I couldn't believe it was only $12 bucks (Best Buy Version).  I think David Gilmour is timeless.  He sounds amazing after all these years.  I don't think there is any doubt that he is one of the best Guitar players of our generation.  I think almost every review I read said that Echoes alone makes the DVD worth buying and of course they are right.  Rick Wright and David still harmonize beautifully together and Dave's guitar and Ricks Keyboards were amazing.  I enjoyed all of the Documentary as well.  Another highlight of the DVD was David's performance of \\"Dark Globe\\".  I believe that it was Dave's tribute to Syd after he heard the news that Syd passed away.  It was very emotional, you can see Syd Barrett meant a lot to Dave and it showed on that song.  All in all, this DVD is spectacular and it is highly reccomended for all Floyd fans.
0142402532|4.0|I feel sad for anyone who has seen the movie before reading this book because it certainly doesn't do it justice. Dahl is by far my favorite children's author and he never runs out of witty hilarity that's peppered throughout each book. Matilda is no exception. Dahl puts a spin on the orphaned child motif by empowering children.  He also spices it up with a big of magic that's directly connected to Matilda's love of reading and her knack for creative problem solving. Matilda's lovable, humble, and a wonderful model for young readers who, well...love to read.
075640407X|5.0|What an enjoyable book!  I couldn't put it down and immediately after finishing started over and read it through again.  I can't remember the last time I've done that with a book, nor taken the time to write a review on Amazon.  To me, the voice of the writer is similar to Le Guin's:  mature, thoughtful, and speaks volumes about life, longing, and human nature while telling a compelling story.    I also enjoyed how the writer takes pains to break the expectations of the fantasy reader.  The writer almost tweaks the reader's nose in a few places about the predictable elements that we've all come to expect in fantasy novels and says \\"ah, you were expecting the formulaic? Hold on, I'm giving you a REAL story\\".    The first of a trilogy--can't wait for the remaining volumes.
1582701709|4.0|I've read The Secret and enjoyed it.  Today I spent some time reading the 1 and 2 star reviews on this website and I think that some of them miss the point or take the book way too literally.  I think that the most important thing someone should take from The Secret is the power of positive thinking.  Now, don't believe that you can simply \\"wish\\" for things out of thin air.  You're not going to manifest a brand new car simply by wishing for it and believing it will come to you.  Instead, you need to work it, keeping in mind that positive thinking can help you.    For instance, I use The Secret whenever I want to find a new, better job.  I think to myself \\"I believe I will get a new job and that it will be better than my last job\\".  And then I don't just sit around and wait for it to happen.  I look at job postings and I send out resumes.  But instead of giving it to self-pity or desperation if my search takes me longer than I had hoped, or I don't get an interview for a job I wanted, I choose to continue to think positively and believe that it will happen.      I'm not being crazy by doing this.  Sabatoging myself with self-pity will get me nowhere and may lead to frustration, poorly written resumes or I may give up altogether.  Instead, positive thinking (believing that there is a great job for me out there and that I will get it) encourages me to keep trying and to continue my education or network with people or learn more about my skills and how to present them....all of which will (eventually) land me that job.    Yes, this book is very repetitive and is sometimes a bit ridiculous (there is such a thing as bad luck and we don't bring all bad things on ourselves....ie. terrible disasters or trajedies like 9/11).  But there is something to be said for the power of positive thought, or the harmony that one can find in being grateful for the things you have.    I'm not a doctor, but even I know that you can't simply \\"will\\" away illness such as cancer.  But any doctor will tell you that keeping a positive outlook on things will help you in your journey to recovery.  My sister was in a terrible car crash last year and nearly died.  She suffered many painful injuries (including a month-long stay in the hospital, breaking her femur, not walking for over two months, a now life-long battle with chronic pain and other injuries too numerous to mention).  Her ordeal would have crushed a lesser person, but she always believed in the power of positive thinking and refused to give up.  People told her that she wouldn't be able to walk normally again, but she said that she would and now she does.  She will always suffer the effects of that crash, but she is determined to live her life and to live it well.  Giving into self-pity and depression would have only kept her in that hospital bed longer.    In summary, don't think that you can simply wish things out of thin air.  You have to be prepared to work for things.  But if you believe that you will achieve your goals and that good things will happen to you, then your beliefs will assist you in achieving those goals and making a better life for yourself.
0374105235|5.0|This book is not for the fainthearted who wants a feel good story; this is tough book to read, however, it is an important book to read as well. So often us here in the west are isolated from the fact that there are tough places to live on this planet, places where people are forced to do unspeakable acts and are exposed to unimaginable acts of violence.   This book takes on the voyage of a young man named Ishmael, who lived in the war torn country of Sierra Leone. His life is completely turned upside down by the civil war in that country. Ishmaels story is first a story of losing his family, than of losing his innocence as he is forced to fight for the Countries Army that's fighting the \\"rebels\\". After that the story focuses on his rehabilitation in a place called Freetown and eventually his new life in the United States (although I would like to know more about how he is today).   The most amazing part of this story as an American who simply didn't understand the truth, is that this Ishmael was 12 years old and was killing people, not because he was an animal, but because he was drugged and forced to become one merely to survive. This is a concept that as westerners we look on and go oh that's too bad, but do we really take the time to understand that this happens all the time in the same world we live in? Do we take the time to understand that there is big world out there and for the most part it isn't that safe little havens we take for granted? I challenge anyone who reads this book to be able to look at the world the same again.

0553805460|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!!     A solid page-turner that leaves you wanting more. You can't get over the life that this guy lived and the grown-up toys that he owned and played with. This guy writes so well that could have committed murder live on national television and still left people thinking he didn't do it.    Hats off to you, Jordan Belfort!
1857152204|5.0|Catch-22 is the greatest novel of its kind.  In all of humorist literature no author captures the moments of its characters so fully.  All of the characters jump out from the pages with their realistic qualities and depth of construct.  The humor follows through serious and tragic circumstances to help the reader realize the ludicrosity of war.<br /> This is the great predecessor to the pop-culture phenomenon of M*A*S*H.<br /> Not only are you left rolling with laughter at the events of Catch-22 as well as the illogical baseness of military thought, but you are left shaking your head at the parallel of unimaginable events to modern historical events.  The treatment is timeless and the laughter is limitless.<br /> The advantage of this edition, as with all Everyman's Library editions, is the quality of binding and thorough chronology of the author as a preset to the text.
0553805460|5.0|I wasn't expecting to read it in one sitting but that's what happend. I couldn't put it down. Belfort does a great job of taking you on a wild, crazy, and often sad ride through his life. I'd pay to see the movie but i doubt it would be as entertaining as this book.

B000GIXEIG|2.0|I have to believe that the director or the writer of this film has connection to the death-metal scene and/or that kind of market was his intended audience. Because there's lots of modernity about the hairstyles, earrings, decorations, jokes, and dialog rather than there is anything Anglo-Saxon about it. I do have to give kudos to the scenery captured on film here. It is stunning and evocative. But, unfortunately, usually what it evokes is a bad joke or hearty beer-yell or chest thump. That's probably one of my problems with the film. For instance, when the King Hygelac sends Beowulf off, he tells him, \\"And make sure you bring back a wife; our sheep have had enough.\\" Gerard Butler plays a beer-drinking blowhard, and Hrothgar is the most pitiful drunk one's ever seen. There's a scene where Grendel scares the whits out of Beowulf and his boys by shaking the door and then urinating on the doorstep; then out jump Beowulf and his thanes, Anglo-Saxon yells penetrating the dark, swords at the ready, and then they stamp and cough and choke once they get a whiff of Grendel's gift. That kind of humor and odd-ball anticlimacticism represents this film in a nutshell. There are some fun things here. The young Grendel, with the white whispy beard of an old man (it's kind of like chicken feathers, really; they're white and whispy before they turn any kind of color) is a wonderful, old-school makeup creation. But then he cuts Dad's head off and leaves in the cave as a memento mori and, I guess, just because he loves him so much. I'll leave it at that. This is a weird film. But worth watching. This is Monty-Python meets Beowulf with just enough of the literature thrown in to call it \\"Beowulf.\\" (There's some bad translation, too. Like the first scene's entitlement:  \\"A Hatred is Born.\\" Not very stylish.) If you're into beer and cheers and double entendre and half-machismo, this is for you.
0446691437|3.0|Pressfield's book has been extremely helpful in getting me to sit down at my table and write.  It is too bad that the book seems so poorly and haphazardly written.  The beginning, in which he defines resistance, was useful, but after that I wanted more depth and found many of the things he said contradicted one another.  I found the sections on angels and muses especially didactic and opaque.  He never answers the question of why we create resistance for ourselves.  Is it because we are afraid of success?  That seems a little simple to me, but he doesn't even offer that as an answer.  Pressfield shows us a landscape and points out the mountains and lakes in great detail, but he doesn't give us any understanding of the glaciers and tectonic forces that shaped these landmarks, leaving us ultimately unsatisfied.  Perhaps a good complement to this book would be Flow.
B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|Another movie with an intriguing premise that freefalls into typical hollywood schlock. I've lost track of how many movies start out with a really cool idea, then fizzle once the plot unfolds. The 1st 20 minutes or so of this movie are fun and entertaining. Then , when you discover the 'Typical-Outlandish-Hollywoodized-Plot' TM (lol), you can't wait for the ending. Nickolas Cage is a favorite actor of mine, but his movies have been the pits lately, for the most part. I recommend watching this movie right up to the point where Cage's character gets busted in the casino. That whole idea of him outfoxing casino security was great together with the fascinating ability that he has.....and then.....the inevitable laughable, forced, typical, ridiculous, homogenized, hollyood plot kicks in, and your left wondering why great actors like Cage and Julianne Moore signed on to stuff like this. At least we get to see the gorgeous Jessica Biel!
B000K7VHUU|4.0|This movie has been in my collection for years.  Therefore, I had to get it upgraded in my HD collection.  I enjoy it more now, since the picture is sharper.  An excellent movie.  One for the times.  Good for reflecting back to the \\"Good old days\\".
B000RZIGVS|3.0|As one might have guessed, with Paramount's vast history of gouging Trekkers with their DVD sets, it seems once again, fans/consumers have been invaded by another expensive re-release, right in time to correlate with the 20th anniversary of the second television incarnation of Star Trek.      Granted, Star Trek:The Next Generation is most certainly something to celebrate: the show itself was not only popular with audiences and critics alike, but it was also a creative achievement in its own right, due to an extraordinary cast that were, more often than not, working with wonderfully written material that had deep rooted themes with rich character explorations, and were topped off by exciting sci-fi special effects. The average viewer (like my 12 year old counterpart) may not have been ready for these production values after growing up with the Original Series years before.   But, as we all know Star Trek: TNG prevailed, from the shaky \\"Encounter At Farpoint\\" until the grand finale of \\"All Good Things...\\", the show had turned into an experience, I was absorbed in Roddenberry's world, as I still am today...     But I'm not sure that this specific DVD set is the proper way to salute TNG.  Sure, if you haven't already purchased the previous releases, this new set is almost a sweet deal.  But for the great majority of people have already spent $300 to $700 in the past on the almost the exact same product (were talking identical material, right down to the menus) they really don't need that same expense again just to acquire a single NEW bonus disc.     If Paramount really wants to honor this great show, they should release the 20th anniversary DVD as a standalone single disc.     That would be treating the massive amount of TNG fans right.

B0000A1RJI|4.0|I love watching the movie more for the music score than the acting.  This is a great soundtrack.  Listening to it brings the different scenes to mind.  My only complaint is that some of the tracks are short for a soundtrack recording.  The last track is the best one but it's only a minute and a half long.  Before you know it, you've listened to the entire CD and it's over.  You're left wishing it lasted a little longer. But it's still great CD.
B00006J9OV|5.0|Levine's 1993 Met performance and Horst Stein's 1981 audience-free Bayreuth production are the only traditional \\"Parsifals\\" on DVD, so a comparison seems in order. The Bayreuth \\"Parsifal\\" has very fine singing but is marred by less than involved acting and occasional weak production touches by Wolfgang Wagner. The singing at the Met is just as good, and Otto Schenk's production is far better. The Met scores in terms of scenery, staging and acting. There is a magic in New York that is not there in Bayreuth, which has a more plain, homespun quality, attractive in its own way (similar in that regard to Wolfgang Wagner's \\"Bayreuth \\"Meistersinger.\\").<br /><br />Schenk's handling of characters is just more involving and inviting. Here are seemingly real people facing important issues. Wolfgang Wagner's sense of stage acting comes basically from the stand and deliver school, lacking much compelling interaction between characters to bring the drama to life. The drama here is not exactly gripping; static is more like it.<br /><br />On its own, the Bayreuth forest that opens acts 1 and 3 is fine, but next to the Met's grand and realistic outdoors, feels a bit cramped and artificial after a while. Bayreuth's second scene of both acts (the hall of the castle of the grail), a la his brother Wieland's 1951-75 production, is abstract yet compelling, too, in its own way. But the Met has a more spiritual setting and a more deeply affecting result.<br /><br />Act 2 starts out in Bayreuth with Klingsor's castle looking like a cheap science fiction B-movie scene with cheesy-looking smoke, abstract curved pillars on the side and Klingsor dominating from above like a tacky evil superhero. Unconvincing. Laughable even. Sad when Leif Roar is a most compelling Klingsor, full of menace and in vibrant voice. The Met's scenery and staging are more believable, richer in imagery and impression, but Franz Mazura as good as he is, can't compare vocally to Roar, and looks a bit old.<br /><br />Vocally, both casts are very fine. Each Gurnemanze, the vocal center of the opera, offers rich vocal portrayals, although Wolfgang Wagner has Hans Sotin act rather too condescendingly toward Parsifal in Act 1, losing some of our sympathy. The Met's Kurt Moll is rather more the wise-old grandfatherly type in the spirit of the well-meaning Gurnemanz.<br /><br />Siegfried Jerusalem is both Parsifals, and his extra 12 years of stage experience shows more strongly at the Met. The voice may be slightly fresher at Bayreuth and his youthful looks a plus, but his Met Parsifal is deeper, more natural and more eloquent.<br /><br />Bernd Weikl also graces both productions as an outstanding Amfortas. His Wieland Wagner-enforced less-is-more movement at Bayreuth is not a hindrance in this spiritually and physically wracked character, and in some ways is a plus.<br /><br />Waltraud Meier's Kundry is one of the Met's highlights. She is more fetching and physically expressive than Bayreuth's Eva Randova, well as she sings. Meier brings a sensuality and stronger vocalizing to Kundry that is most compelling.<br /><br />The conductor comparison surprised me, as I have not been a fan of Levine's Wagner, finding his \\"Ring\\" protracted and heavy handed. But \\"Parsifal\\" is a different animal in the Wagner canon; my two favorite audio recordings both come from that master of grand, Knappertsbusch (Bayreuth, 1951 and 1962). Levine, while not quite on his level, brings off a spirituality and conversely, more animation when called for, that the straightforward Stein, who is a good but not overly compelling (similar to what I felt about his Bayreuth DVD \\"Meistersinger\\").<br /><br />Levine may unduly stretch tempos now and then, but to my taste, his is a more involved and felt journey than Stein's.  Stein offers a good, solid reading which has the benefit of flow but misses some of Levine's passion and depth.<br /><br />The drama is more real, believable and interactive in New York than Bayreuth. Thesets and staging are more natural and compelling, too. An outstanding release.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|The movie is not as great as the novel, but almost! You should buy it!
B000T05R8Q|5.0|This is how albums should be rereleased.  I like comparing stereo and mono versions for fun and this offers two distinct visions of a great album.    I bought the 1994 remaster and thought I was happy with it, but the sound on these is fantastic given their analog origins.  I have listened to this set every day since it arrived (about four days ago)and seem to find new nuances with every pass.    The packaging is true to the original work, but incorporates new and unreleased elements without deterring from what was.  I love the third disc with the singles and alt versions.  Tk 6 of Interstellar Overdrive is incredible.  I would love to see all of Pink Floyd's albums reconfigured into this format.  Even the later albums would be fun (I know there are no mono versions) with alt, demos and live cuts.    If you are thinking of buying this album, I recommend that you do it sooner.
0743554450|5.0|This is one of the best book I have ever read in a long time.  If I had not read the Kite Runner prior to this one, I would have assumed it was written by a woman.  I was pulled in to the book from the page one and it's been about 3 weeks since I finished the book and I still think about it.  The ending had tears streaming down my cheeks.  Bravo, Mr. Hosseini, you have done it again!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Where to begin with an epic of such proportions?  First, let me say that there just is no point in buying the theatrical release version, as it is quite simply, an inferior movie.  So many important storylines ('arc,' as apparently they are called these days!) and scenes are missing in the theatrical version, it is really no great surprise it only obtained a moderate reception at the theaters.  Just goes to show how reliance on MBA's can really screw up a great piece of work!    Second, it is important to understand that while this movie deals with historical subjects (the fall of Jerusalem and the Crusades in general), there are a number of historical inaccuracies, for the most part introduced for dramatic effect.  However this does not affect the point the director (Ridley Scott) is trying to make, nor does it significantly affect the historical actions as they actually took place, or the actions and personalities of many of the historical characters as best as they are known.    The Crusades (much like today) was a time of fanaticism and barbarism on all sides, terrible bloodshed and loss to civilization as a whole, but it was also a time of great nobility and selfless personal acts as well.  'Kingdom of Heaven' is designed to show the barbarism, greed, violence AND inherent nobility and beauty of thought of BOTH sides.  Really, this is the point that Scott is trying to make; that despite the 'demonization' of opposites that is promoted by both Christian and Muslim causes, fundamentally, people are the same regardless, and both evil and goodness can be found everywhere.  Only an individuals personal 'Kingdom of Conscience' can determine what that persons actions and relationship will be with God, and his fellow man.  This is what the main character, 'Balian' (Orlando bloom) demonstrates throughout, after careful coaching by both his father 'Godfey' (Liam Neeson) and 'Baldwin IV, the leper King of Jerusalem.' The karmic reward for his 'lessons learned' is providedby Saladin himself, as well as by a Muslim prince whose life he had spared before.    I have seen several reviews of this movie claiming it is some sort of PC apologia for the Muslims, with all the Crusaders (read Christians/Westerners) presented as being all awful, horrible, bloodthirsty greedy savages, etc, etc, but in fact that is not the case at all.  The first Muslim that Balian encounters in the Holy Land tries to cut off his head and steal his horse, just because he thinks he can.  Fanatical Mullahs try to force Saladin to break his treaty with Baldwin, even threatening to depose him if he does not.  Balian's father Godfrey, his spiritual councilor and a hospitaller knight, the Marshal of Jerusalem (Jeremy Irons), and of course, King Baldwin himself are all highly moral Christian figures, struggling to maintain peace, order and justice against a rising tide of fanaticism brought on by a combination of greed and religious fervor.  Events overtake them all and the chips fall where they may, as happened historically.    Cinematically, this movie is a treat!  Brilliant filming of stunning locations, the like of which I haven't seen since 'Lawrence of Arabia!'  Excellent use of and appreciation for lighting effects, enormous sets and 'a cast of thousands' plus CGI, what more could you want?  In other words, if you have been looking for a gorgeous epic full of moral messages that you haven't seen since 'Lord of the Rings,' then I can suggest no better film!
B00004R99F|4.0|Amazon's in house reviewer above said \\"strictly for young fans.\\"  No, this is also for any adult who loves animation.  I didn't like Goofy until i saw this movie.  But I loved the way they wrapped a clever-thoughtful guy inside the awkward exterior. It gave me a new perspective.    I'll admit a couple of the songs were a bit painful, but there are so many great gags and great sequences in this story I couldn't help but be impressed.  This is way better than some of the high-budget princess movies Disney was grinding out at the same time.  And this was done by Disney's second string  animators... wow!    It's a road movie, it's a buddy movie, it's a teen romance movie, it's a father-son movie, it's a whacky neighbor movie, it's a satire movie, it's a musical movie... all rolled into one.
B000SO7IRG|5.0|Mazzy Star were basically a duo of guitarist David Roback and singer Hope Sandoval. This set features the groups first 2 CD's \\"She Hangs Brightly\\" (1990), and \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\" (1993).    This is such a great set, apparently it just became available over the summer, I have all 3 Mazzy Star CD's along with a solo Hope Sandoval CD, so I'm a huge fan of the vocalist and her style, very laid back, folksy, part goth, almost a lazy feel to her vocals; great for late night listening under a full moon perhaps or any day you wanna relax a bit and enjoy some great music.    Hard for me to pick favs, as each song seems to offer something new. I like every song on both CD's basically. \\"Fade Into You\\" is probably the most recognizeable song on the set, but there are so many others like \\"Blue Flower\\", \\"Ride It On\\", from the debut; and \\"Five String Serenade\\", \\"Mary Of Silence\\", \\"Blue Light\\", and \\"She's My Baby\\" on the second CD that are perhaps favs. Both CD's have a very psychedelic, folksy sound like said, but to me they were pure early 90's alternative, like stuff you would hear in a dark club late at night along with the other alternative type/goth stuff of the days.    Very atmospheric, slow, sometimes disconnected songs that always have a way of letting you in and wanting to hear another. A Song like \\"She Hangs Brightly\\" is a great example of that I think, at nearly 6:30 in length, it manages to keep a gothic, dark resonance to it that sometimes makes you wish the jam could go on and on. It's followed by \\"Sailin\\", which shifts to an old fashioned bluesy feel, like something Janis Joplin might have belted out, but Sandoval just glides it along so effortlessly, it just feels like your traveling somewhere.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|We've always loved the sound and the music of the Bee Gees, the Brothers Gibb. This live concert DVD brings back their amazing talent, their great harmony, and brings the memories of their performances back to life. Song selection is great, their harmony is right on, and the performance is just fabulous. My wife and I found ourselves singing along, dancing around the room, applauding as though we were actually there at this performance. There is a song that they do with video of Andy Gibb in the background, which was very touching.  They also did some songs that they wrote, but were done by other performers and they were great too. Celine Dion does a special appearance, singing one of the songs, and the Bee Gees performed with her. it was just FAB.  I find it amazing that a group this talented went through a period where they couldn't get a hit of  their own (maybe due to over exposure or change in the public's taste in music), but wrote songs that others performed that were smash hits. It's a shame that two of the Gibbs, as well as Andy are not with us anymore, leaving only Barry. It would be so great to see them together again. If you're a Bee Gees fan, this DVD is for you, no question about it. I collect concert DVD's and this is one of my best acquisitions, on of our FAVE RAVES!!!
B00009NQQO|3.0|This product is great for storing the balls. But when my boys are playing with it, it's often frustrating because the ball stays in the hoop. Because of this you can' place it up high, so you have to put it at their level and often they take it off or it falls off because they are trying to retrieve the balls.
0618680004|2.0|The one thing that strikes me most about the many reviews on this book is the degree of fanaticism on either side. As a person grounded in science does it really matter that some believe in a higher power? As for evolution there are certainly no shortage of holes in the theory itself (as Darwin admitted at the time). But those facts do not diminish the value of evolutionary theory as a vehicle for creating hypotheses to advance knowledge. Aristotle's Golden Mean posited that extremes are undesirable. That seems like a common sense attitude.     In terms of this book I have often found it difficult to become engrossed in any piece of science that starts by trying to tear down the personal beliefs of others. Anything else is just a waste of the gifts that researchers have enjoyed over the course of recent history. Simply put and without prejudice I see the effort spent on this book as a waste of time. And I just don't see the value of this type of fanatisicm any more than the effort some put toward burning declared heretics at the stake.
B0000263JN|5.0|Like so many others, I met the Incredible String Band through this album. Some 40 years later, it retains all the whimsy & magic & mystery it held for a wide-eyed teenager, immersed in the heady high point (to say the least) of the 1960s. Admittedly, it's not for every taste -- but then, it never was, even during the heyday of the band. Certainly its childlike, Romantic spirit runs absolutely counter to the grim cynicism & defensive glibness of the present.<br /><br />But that's all the more reason for sampling this otherworldly elixir now. If you're willing to give it a chance, willing to give yourself over to its tapestry of delights & darker musings, you'll discover another way of experiencing the world. One of the most fascinating slogans of the 1960s was, \\"All power to the imagination!\\" Well, this album embodies that attitude more than almost any other from that time. It's a reminder that life isn't simply about survival; it's about joy & wonder & beauty.<br /><br />You can look on it as a precursor to world music, if you like, or as a descendant of English Romanticism, or the bardic tradition, with roots in myth & nature. You can take it as an exemplar of its time -- and as for the Amazon reviewer's comment about \\"airy excesses,\\" well, the words of William Blake apply here: \\"The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.\\" However you classify it, it's a fascinating, lovely work of art, most highly recommended!
B0007X6ST2|5.0|I remember when my father bought this album on cassette when it first came out.  He ended up buying another copy because I literally wore it out on him!  I used to listen to this everyday for like 3 years.  \\"Bring on the Night\\" ranks in at #1 on \\"my favorite live albums\\" list!  Like Sting's solo stuff on here, I also dug the new twists on some of \\"The Police\\" tracks!  I've had this on CD for years now and still enjoy it immensely!  Another good friend of mine begged me to let her borrow it and I finally gave in.  She says that it's now one of her favorites too.  So you now heard it from me; we enjoy it, I know you will too.
0553805460|5.0|What a great read! From the moment i opened the book i couldn't put the book down. Not only is it well written, it's hilarious, endearing and filled with humility. I recommended it to everyone i know. Good job Belfort....when's book two?
B000UR366S|4.0|I'm writing this review after a long, tiring day and am not fishing for helpful votes.  I believe this album is one of the few \\"comeback\\" recordings by a major artist that has succeeded, not only because of the intensity of the lyrics which focus on the complexities of love and the amage wrought by those who abuse politics for selfish ends.  In this sense, she is the same, lyrical, committed artist she was in the 1960's and '70's.  Whie I will one day listen to this album more carefully, I have run it on a virtual loop for a day, and can make the following claims:  The cigarette rasp has faded from the voice. In its place is a full, earnest, very listenable smoky alto voice that carries the show nicey.  The backup band is absolutely superb, as is the sound engineering.  The package is well-designed and lyrics, as usual are included.  I am not a fanatic about musicians, but I know what I like.  This is a mellow, compassionate, listenable album producedin a meticulous way.  The only dud is Mitchell's new cover of BIG YELLOW TAXI.  One wonders why it is here and what this particular cover does to the song's equity. Nothing beats BLUE in the long run.  Starbucks has become very selectie about its productions, but they have succeeded once again. It is comforting to know that an artst I loved while I was in college is back in action, producing and performing on albums that have lasting value.  If you already love Joni Mitchell, buy this without reservation. If not, test the cuts and decide for yourselves.  I just loved it.
B000N3SSBM|5.0|Very good make you think movie. Not the same old mindless movie. Sit back and enjoy.
1861976100|4.0|Using actual examples and sharp analysis, Al Ries and Jack Trout offer 22 \\"laws\\" that amount to a basic, concise distillation of their marketing experience and wisdom. Their examples are pithy enough to keep the most jaded marketing person engaged. And their lessons are embedded verities that would be hard to dispute. The only drawback is that this classic may be a bit dated, so it is interesting to see how surprisingly well some of their original observations have fared over the years. We recommend this classic to anyone seriously interested in marketing. After all, you can't ignore the law.
1878424319|1.0|I am shocked at all the 5 stars and positive press this book has received.  PLEASE, read a few of the 1 star reviews before you purchase this book.   Quite often people who rate something with just 1 star are grumpy individuals who just want to argue... not this time.  Many writers of the single star reviews are extremely well spoken, very well read and positive minded individuals.  They are worth reading!  (More so than this book.)

0385512058|4.0|Excellent read.  Fast read that sets-up a lot of tangible strategies through heartfelt experiences of success and failure.  Some great references to other texts that have also turned out to be fantastic reads.
B000002KIE|5.0|If you dont own this and perhaps Damaged by Black Flag,then you simply are either a musical neanderthal,or too young to know or even understand what punk actually was.

B0000041CZ|5.0|It's all a matter of how many WTCs you can afford. I like them all. Not because I like everything, far from it, but because there have been some amazing performers out there over the years, making up for the fact that they don't improvise or create new music, creatively stretching Bach's paper, making it their battleground. If you thought Glenn Gould was eccentric, but (on reflection) maybe not quite eccentric enough, you should try this one.     It might be brutal to make this someone's first WTC, but this certainly is original, just when we thought we'd run out of ruses.    It's a VERY clean recording. Very sparse. Completely to-the-point. Exquisite clarity, close-mic'ed, no silly room reverb, and the felt on the hammers was probably filed and needled before each session! They did a great job re-mastering this 1973 session. This sounds like a Steinway up close, laid into phat analog tape, with all the tape hiss gone. Luscious. You can hear every wave bouncing off the lid.       Just when I thought rubato was the essence of consideration, here comes this approach, and it turns out rubato is a cheap trick. It's as if Gulda trimmed back most of the piano's sustain pedal, so it was harder to press, and played sitting on a land-mine. This is to most other renditions as a Zen garden is to Chuck-e-Cheese. Glenn Gould sounds dreamy, in comparison. Gulda hits something on the head. Every note counts. Well, that's always true, but haven't you heard people WASTE notes? Most WTC performances are sort of \\"on the way to the next measure\\". But not Gulda's. It's like that thing he's sitting on is reminding him (and us) of our mortality, and of the importance of the moment. There IS something martial here as well. Indeed what makes it less than ideal for a beginner is how extreme it can be in all other dimensions while retaining those fixed tempos.     Now and then he fires off maybe the fastest WTC selection ever heard, as if demonstrating the futility of trying to outrun it, though he sprints like the devil. Then he comes back into focus, and it's like watching the I.V. drip again. Some tempos are almost below the range of a metronome. But, you see, every drop matters. He is SO effective in bringing out inner voicings, that a few sudden changes in the overall volume are puzzling, and may be mastering artifacts.     It's entirely unrobotic, even though the tempo is fixed, because each note is placed with a meticulous micro-timing and dynamic that makes you think vertically, as much as some of the other great performances make you think thematically, or horizontally. It's not even a focus on harmony, it's the SPACE around the note, and how Bach set it up. I think it's brilliant, at times almost supra-human. I've heard my fair share of WTCs. This one had me mesmerized.    You will find that it will land on/in your player whenever things get too messy in your life. It's a great set to add if you already have a baroque or romantic one. But, truth be told, I can't think of a better set to be the primary. And if you listen very very carefully you can hear him hum -- or maybe it's the music of the spheres joining in.
B00005JO5L|3.0|As steamy as it seems, obviously things were toned down for the general public, the movie doesn't really accomplish much in either erotic tone or heart throbbing suspense. Actually I am surprised at how graphic it is for that time period.  Sadly, probably to avoid an X rating and major protests from Christian fanatics as well as the gay leather community, they book was not carefully recreated.  But then, is it ever?!  It could have been much better but of course this is Hollywood, not a place that is interested in creating art, or dedicated to honest recreations of great books (not that this is a great book).  It's only interested in generating money.
B000002B1M|5.0|After [[ASIN:B0000029GA Illmatic]] was released Nas became the new it rapper.  Everyone loved the CD.  Yes, it is one of the ten greatest rap CD's of all time, but some of those people sleep on his second release.  The classic It Was Written.  The CD is equally as impressive as his debut but just short of th masterpiece status.  It's not as concise, and some songs seem to not fit, but otherwise definitely one of the best.    My favorites include The Message (must hear), I Gave You Power, Take It In Blood, Nas Is Coming, Black Girl Lost, Suspect, Live Nigga Rep, and IF I Ruled the World.    Definitely Highly recommended.  Must Have even.
B001F3FUK6|3.0|The Man of Steel had vanished for five long years.<br /><br />The world moved on.<br /><br />So did the one person everyone thought never would: Lois Lane. She even wrote about it in a Pulitzer Prize-winning article entitled, “Why the World Doesn’t Need Superman.”<br /><br />But that’s not all that changed. Lex Luthor had swindled his way out of a double life-sentence with a new plan: create his own continent and wipe out all the others.<br /><br />He just wasn’t prepared for one thing—Superman returns.<br /><br />It’d been almost twenty years between Superman movies when this one came out, the last being Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. Expectations were high, the hype was through the roof, a star director (Bryan Singer) was attached to it, huge names played some of the key roles . . .<br /><br />The payoff: an embarrassing movie.<br /><br />I remember feeling ashamed of my hero when I walked out of the theatre. Being a lifelong Superman fan, I thought Superman Returns would nail it and kick a certain red-and-blue wallcrawler off the box office charts.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />The story of Superman Returns is okay. It’s nothing new, pretty much a rehash of Superman: The Movie, just updated with a different spin.<br /><br />There are also several terrible and nonsensical moments in the film: Superman’s son, Superman in the hospital, Superman lifting a massive island made of kryptonite and flying it into space even though just before that scene being around kryptonite made him virtually mortal.<br /><br />It was tempting to give this movie two stars, but Brandon Routh’s portrayal of the Man of Steel saved the day. He did a stellar job as both Clark and Superman. Aside from Christopher Reeve, he’s my favorite boy in blue.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey did an all right job as Lex Luthor—evil, funny, selfish, manipulative, king of understatement. But he wasn’t evil-evil, unlike Michael Rosenbaum in Smallville. Though I realize they’re different continuities/series, you’d think a grown-up Lex would be darker than his younger counterpart.<br /><br />Warner Brothers et al. erred with this film because they didn’t remember the secret to Superman: people don’t want to relate to him. He’s an icon, an ideal. He’s not Spider-Man. We want to be amazed, put in a state of awe. People only want to relate to Clark Kent, not his cape-wearing alter ego. They blurred the line between the two when it should have been crisp and clear, and that is where this movie failed.<br /><br />Hopefully the sequel will not be a drama, but a serious yet fun superhero movie, one filled with wonder, eye-popping action and a story worthy of the Man of Steel. I just hope they don’t use kryptonite as a weapon against Superman. If they do, they’re going to have to use a whole planet’s worth to make a dent seeing as how a kryptonite island didn’t stop him.fferent continuities/series, you’d think a grown-up Lex would be darker than his younger counterpart.<br /><br />Warner Brothers et al. erred with this film because they didn’t remember the secret to Superman: people don’t want to relate to him.

0743486285|5.0|This book is about Nikki Sixx's pain and all the drinking and drugs he took to block his brain from thinking and feeling anything about his childhood.  Drug addiction is horrifying.  His diary is a lot about his shooting up everything you can think of including putting Jack Daniels in a syringe and shooting that up.  There are a lot of torrid tidbits about the band on tour with Whitesnake and Guns and Roses.  It is brutally honest and worth a read.  I did not know that he and Donna were divorced and was sorry to read that.  He did everything he could to kill himself, but by the grace of God he is still alive.  I hope he continues to stay sober.
1592220045|3.0|Most people reading this book will do so already having experienced Martin's genius from his other works.  Unfortunately, the strength of his vaunted \\"Ice and Fire\\" series, namely the characters, is where this story is at its weakest.    The plot, setting and details in this book are quite engaging.  The idea of one man floating around space doing good deeds with his massively powerful ancient weapon system is classic and making that weapon a cloning ship is a nice spin on the idea.    The downfall of Tuf Voyaging is Tuf himself, and the various people who's acquaintance he makes.  Tuf is painfully lacking in any appealing qualities beyond his supposed morality.  There is no depth to his character apart from his love for cats which is explained most telling by the author's shared affection.    All the various stories seem to revolve around Tuf's infallibility in the face of massive global ecological puzzles despite his humble trader background.  Towards the end of the novel I found myself hoping he would be proved wrong or defeated in some way as his self-perceived perfection was becoming tiresome and repetitive.  In the last pages of the book a glimmer of hope shows through when we almost see a spark of emotion from the character.  The undertones of the ethical implications of the godlike powers of this weapon corrupting a once good-natured man and turning him into a monster ultimately end in disappointment and we close the story with the same character we started.    As if to accentuate this character's aura of intellectual and moral superiority, the surrounding characters seemed to have been dumbed down.  Everyone in the future is completely lacking in subtly, guile and intuition and completely inept in the face of the main character's awesome prowess.    In summary, though the idea is excellent, the forced and shallow storyline fail to make this novel worthy of recommendation.
1582701709|1.0|Want to know \\"The Secret\\"?  I'll tell you, if you think positively, then positive things will happen to you.  That's pretty much it.  Watching this DVD was painful.  It is just a bunch of people with titles such as \\"Quantum Physicist\\" (as if this means they are somehow qualified to lecture us on this subject) and with a few letters behind their names telling you this over and over again in a slightly different way for 80 minutes.  What a load of nonsense.  There is no big \\"Secret\\".  It's just one big marketing tool. Don't waste your time and money.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural is the second best show on the CW and one of the best shows on TV.  The premise is great.  The characters are great and this show genuinely creeps you out.  Jared Padalecki plays Sam perfectly and Jensen Ackles plays Dean brilliantly.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays their dad exceptionally as well.  Definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />The DVD includes commentary on two episodes, a few unaired scenes, a gag reel, and few featurettes, all worth checking out.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Also check out:<br />[[ASIN:B000R7GKQE Supernatural - The Complete Second Season]]

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This ranks as a great sci-fi/futuristic fantasy series.  There is a strong ensemble cast and a strong plot premise.    Firefly is set 500 years in the future.

Any future in depth space exploration would be for resources and colonization.  It also shows the prevailing earth power in the future would be authoritarian with the Chinese prevalent.

These worlds are what you may see in \\"Star Trek\\" or pre occupation Caprica on BSG.  The outer worlds have a lower standard of living.  This does make sense.  In the 17th century North America and South America were dependent on shipments from the Old World(read [[ASIN:155652644X The Winthrop Woman: A Novel]]The Winthrop Woman by Anya Seton)just as a comparison.    If you like more emphasis on technology this may not be the show for you.  This show is character driven.  Some reviewers fault the science for being dodgy but this is true of ALL of the sci-fi series.  This show is also short on idealism as exhibited in shows like Star Trek or Star Wars.    All of the episodes have something to recommend them.  The series raises interesting questions about the Reavers and River Tamm.  The movie Serenity[[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity (Widescreen Edition)]] is recommended as a follow up for that.    In summary, Firefly, the series is an excellent ensemble drama in the tradition of Star Trek and Star Wars(liking one doesn't mean that you have to dislike the others).
0805047905|5.0|From the day we purchased this book, my daughter asks for it EVERYTIME she lies down for a nap or bedtime. I quickly learned it by heart so I could tell her the story in the dark (many times she will fall asleep before I finish). My husband however just changes the story a little bit. My daughter can now read it to us (only 21 months old) and does so often. This book has really helped her learn her animals and colors. I will be giving this book for a shower gift from now on.
B000002OX3|3.0|Released in 1966, A Quick One shows off the side of the Who that wasn't evident on My Generation. While the group's debut is a slab of pure, R&B-soaked rock `n' roll, this is a collection of playful, goofy power-pop tunes and tongue-in-cheek experimental workouts. Which really isn't a bad thing at all, since the Who were one of the world's greatest power-pop bands. Just listen to the fantastic \\"Run Run Run,\\" which opens the album with a flurry of power chords and singsong lyrics. There's also the rollicking \\"I Need You\\" (with some hyperkinetic drumming from Keith Moon) and a high-energy cover of the Motown's classic \\"Heatwave.\\" Other highlights include the deliciously weird \\"Boris the Spider,\\" and a melancholy little ditty entitled \\"Whiskey Man.\\" The album's deranged centerpiece, \\"A Quick One While He's Away,\\" is a madcap epic that combines the structure of a rock opera with the crunchy addictiveness of three-chord pop and the inane joys of a well-told dirty joke. Cool!<br /><br />However, there are a few too many weak tracks here to call this a great album. \\"See My Way\\" and \\"Don't Look Away\\" are tame, dull, and generic, while \\"Cobwebs And Strange\\" is little more than a novelty. \\"So Sad About Us\\" does have something of a chiming, catchy melody, but it gets old after about thirty seconds. Still, the best songs here make this album an excellent purchase for any fan of the Who.
0743486285|5.0|Amazing, Amazing, Amazing.  I never really knew alot about Nikki Sixx(you mostly hear about Tommy Lee in the news) but now that I have read this book, he has a new fan.  I am not much of reader.  Can't remember the last book I read and I usually don't finish them.  But I could not put this book down.  It had a little bit of everything....including heartbreak and humor. I found myself laughing outloud and towards the end of the book, I actually had tears in my eyes thinking of what this man has been through.   I was in my teen years in the 80's and listened to nothing but hair and rock bands. And I have never stopped! Nikki is such a character and so talented.   I bought the CD also and it is just as AWESOME.  What a great concept!  A soundtrack to a book!    I wish I lived near one of his book signings!  I would be there in a heartbeat.
B000UR366S|5.0|Canadian songcraft (Mitchell, Young, Lightfoot and Cockburn) weighs in with her deep concerns for the state of the world at this point in time. The CD left me in tears. Those expecting something like anything from her past should be prepared. This is the work of a woman with her eyes wide open and alarmed at what she sees transpiring in the world. Possessed of a planetary vision, Mitchell articulates her dismay with a resonating wallop that hopefully will inspire listeners to wake up to what collectively has been done in the name of greed and avarice to this planet and to those most disenfranchised. In no small measure her anger is directed at the US, one of the great abusers of power and position in the world, but hits other targets as well - religious zealots of all stripes who believe god so ordained that they should be Most Entitled that it gives them a blank slate to be inhumanely cruel to others, to the planet, to the future.  There is a lot to consider here. On the inner sleeve she quotes her lyric:  Holy Earth  How can we heal you?  We cover you like a blight...  Strange birds of appetite...  If I had a heart I'd cry.    Indeed, this CD will nearly bring you to tears, as it chronicles that hardness in the human heart galvanized by too much power and wealth in the hands of too few while concommitantly there are too many poeple on too little land, desperate for the very basics of human needs. As I have mentioned before, there was a famous case study by psychologists in the 60's at Yale (wonder if W was one of the subjects) in which colonies of rats were gradually and progressively denied access to resources and sustenance. All manner of social sociopathy developed and with overcrowding and deplinishing resources the colony fed on itself and wiped itself out.    Yes. What Mitchell sees is the damage done by tyrants be they in the Middle East, Burma, DC, anywhere where human life and the prospect of the future is sacrificed for the gains and interests of the privileged. That privilege can be the tax-cut endowed wealthy of the US, those whose glorious mansions have buried perfectly arable farm land, churches whose wealth was built on the backs of the poor, and the net result is that we are faced with what Heidegger called the question of technology: are we capable of recovering in our own being that reverence for the planet itself that sustains us. This is not a question to be answered with more gadgets. This requires a fundamental appropriation in our hearts and souls and thinking of an orientation that sees our fate tied directly to the fate of the planet itself. Thich Nhat Hanh would call this the principle of Interbeing. Hegel would advise you, much as Mitchell is with this, that what is on offer now is that Mother Earth is reversing centuries of the Master/Slave dialectic instigated by man's Cartesian obsession with the technological exploitation of the planet's resources. In the Scots' dialect of Dougie MacLean, we are about to discover that \\"you do na own the land, the land owns you.\\"    In the midst of these oracular alarms, Mitchell delivers a simple reworking of Big Yellow Taxi. It stands out as a reminder of an age when people thought romantically, but also heralded an early warning about what we pave over. There are so many brilliant moments on this CD that focusing on any one of them does the entire effort a disservice. Those engaged with life itself will return to this disc repeatedly for encouragement to do something. In whatever measure, armchair rebellion with a latte is no longer sufficient, and the irony should not be lost on anyone that Mitchell has opted to release this disc via Starbucks - might there be anything more unsettling than ruminating with her on the issues she presents as you sip your soy based what the f you call it frappucino? That gulp caught in your gullet is your conscience.  Serendipitously, Mitchell closes the album with Rudyard Kipling's \\"If\\", and the arrival of this disc is just weeks on the heels of Petraeus' (ah, the Greek general from the polyponesis...) recitation before Congress of the same colonialist anthem. I doubt Mitchell knew that W's field marshall would recite this poem, but it adds to the sting and urgency of her call. Kipling might well have encouraged the neo-colonialism of an imperialist regime such as the neo-con US, that Mitchell could find provocation of another sort for just the opposite tack turns the lie of privilege inside out. In many respects this is a brave and remarkable disc.  Not 4 years ago, Mitchell threw the towel in on recording. To her the business was (and remains) a mysogynist cesspool of vitriolic rap and pee-pee stroking. It still is. The world has gotten even more putrid. \\"Men like war\\" she intones. There is something systemically wrong with the species at this point in history. If we don't get beyond the nation state, if we don't get beyond the Cartesian model of being, if we don't begin to see our fate as inherently linked to the fate of the planet, all these ifs have a consequence.  Young delivers his next statement in a couple of weeks. Cockburn and Lightfoot are in the studios. Those who manage to see the world shine, as though from outer space, who see the planet as a whole and not as a force of concentrating private interes, are calling the rest of us to prepare our way of thinking so that what is most true may lean over and take us into its confidence. If we heed that call...
B000068IEU|3.0|I remember when I first heard about this film a couple of years ago, and finding out the the controversy it caused back in the day. I was very eager to watch it, not just because of that reason, but because this was the first Wes Craven film, and future horror directors Sean S. Cunningham (the first Friday the 13th), and Steve Miner (Friday the 13th 2 and 3, as well as a Halloween H20). With this horror flick \\"dream team\\", you would expect this to be a horror masterpiece, but remember, this was before any of these guys ever made a name of themselves in the horror business. Well, after watching it first time, about a year ago, I must say I was disappointed overall. I felt the film just didn't live up to its hype, and I remember the acting as being downright horrible! Well, I have just recently re-watched this film, and I can say that I the second time around, the film wasn't a bad as I previously thought, however, I'm not saying I'm in love with it now, either. As far as the positives go, I think the story and plot to this film is pretty well written. The special effects, I think were great, considering the budget and the time it was made. And because of the low budget and the cheap way the movie was filmed, it does have a \\"real\\" feel to it and helps add effectiveness. Yes, there is a torture/rape scene that has become infamous over the years. And for its time, I can understand the uproar it got. However, in my opinion, I don't think it was all that disturbing or violent, and probably seems a bit tame by today's standards. Now for the negatives, first off being the music!!! Good God, what was Wes thinking here? (yes, we have the main bad guy, Krug (David Hess) to thank for the music here!)There are horrible musical interludes weaved throughout the film ad well as in the background of the most intense scenes! Maybe Craven thought he was being clever by having violent/climatic scenes mixed with happy/trippy background music, but to me, it hurts the film horribly, and takes away from being suspenseful at all. Another negative was the acting. Though the performances were better than I previously thought, they still aren't good, except for that of David Hess (Krug), which I think did an excellent job, and in many ways, saved the movie. However, the roles of the sheriff and the deputy were pretty bad. In fact, it reminded of something out of Smokey and the Bandit when watching them trying to hitch a ride!!! I also felt that the ending was a bit unrealistic in a sense the the parents seemed way too calm about the whole situation, and instead of just going into the killers room and shooting/beating/stabbing them to death, they calmly and carefully planned out a means of revenge. I really don't buy that, but whatever, its a movie, right? Anyway, this DVD contains audio commentary from Craven and Cunningham, a featurette about the film, Outtakes and Dailies, Forbidden Footage, and a little introduction by Craven himself before the film. There are rumors that this film might be remade, and though I'm not a big fan of remakes, I think that in right hands, this film could be made into something real good. The story is already there, just throw in some better acting, better dialog here and there, and definitely a better musical score, and you could have something new and fresh for today's time. Now it may seem that I'm bashing this film a bit too much, but I do feel that it has its rightful place in the horror/suspense genre, and its a must have for any horror fanatic.akes away from being suspenseful at all.

0679882820|5.0|This has been my daughter's favorite book since the beginning. Everyone in our house knows this story by heart, including her. She's only 21 months old and already needs a new book because it is falling apart. She drags it out all the time. It is really easy to get into the story and change voices and make it fun. My daughter can almost read it to me now!
0061122416|5.0|The book has a compelling story and the way it is told lies a bedrock of wisdom about following one's heart even with all the stumbling blocks.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Amazing is all I have to say. I have listened to this CD for the last 5 days straight when driving in my car. The book is just as awesome and so riveting. Needless to say, I am now a Nikki Sixx fan!  Never knew much about him....you would mostly hear about Tommy in the news.  I followed hair and rock bands in the 80's but I never knew Motley Crue was that crazy and messed up!  Both the book AND CD take you into VERY dark places and it seems like Nikki is personally taking you there with him.  Don't buy one or the other...get BOTH. You will not be sorry!
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Don't be like me.Plunk down the few extra bucks for the limited edition.This album has it all,so reward yourself, go 1st class, and knock yourself out.It doesn't get any better than this.
0321344758|4.0|Others have said that Krug's book (2nd edition) is for those with little experience. That is exactly why I found it so useful. There are lots of concepts that are common sense, sure. But until they were pointed out I had not even considered them. His point about the usefulness of tabs was particularly useful to me. I am creating a site now and will incorporate them into my design.    My only complaint is with the binding. The book was so poorly produced that pages began to loosen and fall out before I was finished with the first reading. I am now looking for a big rubber band to hold everything together. I just hate it when that happens.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Death Proof is a pedal to the metal, bad-a** homage to b-movies that is an absolute blast to watch.  What makes the movie so good is that Quentin Tarantino ground his beloved \\"Grindhouse\\" movies to a pulp, found the essence of what he loves, and turned it into something completely unique and compelling to watch.   Death Proof does drag a bit at times and gets a bit too absorbed in dialog, but you will be well rewarded for your patience.  The plot builds towards the film's final twenty minutes, which contains one of the greatest car chases that I have ever seen recorded on film.   Recommended for all QT fans.
0060885378|4.0|Most kids read Little House on the Prairie first, but this book actually is the first book in the series. In this Little House story book, readers get a taste of the 1870s midwest and join Laura, her Ma, and her Pa, and her sisters at the little house in the big woods.
630542845X|5.0|Apparently Mr. Victor Salva had a message to deliver but unfortunately he couldn't live up to his lofty idealized realm of human attainment-that he got caught molesting a child.  Well, he is only a man with undesirable urges that got out of control.  At least he had improved or learned to control himself admirably.  He had to direct Sean Patrick Flanery being molested in nude by the tough boys in the movie.  Flanery is a very goodlooking or, may I say, a young man of great beauty.  May be the director is not gay, in the editor's review he didn't say whether the child Salva molested was a boy or girl.  Or may be Mr. Salva doesn't like grownup boy.     However, we really shouldn't take issue with Mr. Salva's sexual  inadequacy and concentrate instead on the message that he tried to convey to the viewing public--HUMANITY OVER TECHNOLOGY.  This is an age-old issue of human morality deficiency that man has not been able to correct or improve.  Not only that human cruelty has not been subsided it seems to increase in abominable degree. Just look at the world around you, have you seen any improvement at all.  I don't mean materially of course.    Now let come back to the movie, I give it a five-star rating because it's not only quite meaningful, it also very entertaining.  All the actors are good and adequate for their roles, especially, the bad boy who takes great pleasure in harassing Powder.  I don't think Powder is looking at the young man who takes off his shirt and splashes water over himself in front of the mirror in the bathroom with homosexual overtone.  He is only curious and fascinated by a normal barechested male body, all right with admiration if you have to make it that way.  Mr. Salva is undeniably a very intelligent man to be able to write and direct a movie like this.  He is very good in depicting the narrow-mindedness of men.  To involve the divine power and intention to test the human potentiality of human advancement to a higher plane spiritually is more viable or interesting than scientifically.  I don't care if there are flaws in it, to me it's a watchable film, good and entertaining.
0689878451|5.0|Based on the true story of some penguins at the New York Zoo, this book is a moving and delightful introduction to the idea of alternative families.  The wonderful illustrations and straight-forward approach to the story make this book an excellent choice for story-time at home or in school.  The current popularity of penguins and their gosh-darned cuteness make them an excellent choice to introduce young children to the idea that not every family is the same.  I was delighted to learn that the story is true, and know children will want to learn more about Tango and her family; I hope a sequel is in the works!
075640407X|5.0|The Name of the Wind is easily the best fantasy novel written in the last decade. The writing is concise and tight, the characters are memorable and the story is entertaining. If you don't read this book you are missing out on one of the most well spun tales... ever.
B00005221M|5.0|Last of the Mohicans was the movie that had me fall in love with Daniel Day-Lewis. I was convinced he would make the perfect Aragorn for Lord of the Rings - and indeed, he was the person the producers wanted for the part initially. Apparently he turned them down. Why?<br /><br />The story, written by James Fenimore Cooper, is set in 1757. Daniel plays Hawkeye, who is good friends with the last two Mohicans on the planet. They roam the east coast, hunting deer, hanging out with friends and being friendly. Unfortunately for them, war has come to the region. The British are going around grabbing up loose men to defend their forts. The French are coming, and the French have friends.<br /><br />This sets the stage for the good Indians vs the bad Indians. The good Indians are honorable, brave and strong. The bad Indians like to stab people in the back and betray their word.<br /><br />There's romance, too. One of the fort's commanders has two young, beautiful daughters who go on a journey to meet him. They are ambushed, and Hawkeye comes in to save the day.<br /><br />I don't want to give away a lot of the plot points, as you can tell by my summary :) Part of the gorgeous impact of the story is finding out as you go what is going to happen to each character. As you might guess from the title, this is not an upbeat, Disney film. It is about the last of a dying breed, about how traits which should be praised and respected are instead trodden down.<br /><br />The book has many stereotypes, and I feel the movie did a great job of trying to make the story more accurate and round. The director did a great deal of research to make the landscapes, clothing and surroundings as authentic as possible. You don't get to see a lot of Native American life in the movie - probably the closest you get is a short scene where a few natives are playing a game involving balls and sticks with their colonial friends. Still, the few moments you get - like when Hawkeye and his friends slay a deer, then give thanks before touching it - are very moving.<br /><br />If I have a complaint, it's that the scene where Hawkeye is desperately trying to find the two sisters goes by very quickly. It's set up to be a great, monumental task he has, to track them for months and months, to finally rescue them. That is the way it is in the book. In the movie it's more like the girls leave in the morning and by sunset he's caught up with them again. It always bothers me when I watch the movie.<br /><br />Still, I've seen this film dozens of times and it always gets to me. I love the dialogue. I love the soundtrack. I love the scenery and landscapes. A must own as far as I'm concerned.then give thanks before touching it - are very moving.<br /><br />If I have a complaint, it's that the scene where Hawkeye is desperately trying to find the two sisters goes by very quickly.

B00004YZFR|3.0|Pretty interesting tour with the stones back in the 60s. Would have liked more full length song clips
B0000046ZJ|5.0|This recording is high up on my top ten jazz recordings of all time list, and it's a must in every jazz collection. Getz and Peterson display their God-like technique, which is amazing and fun to listen to, but the their technical prowess is never unmusical or contrived, and they always swing hard and communicate perfectly. It's easy to forget that there is no drummer on this recording, and it's really a benefit in this case. A drummer would have clearly gotten in the way. As Art Tatum is obvious in Peterson's playing, there is also a clear Lester Young influence in Getz that comes through very strongly on this recording. However, one never feels that Getz is a rip-off of Lester Young. He's clearly found his own style by 1957 and his improvisations are original and fluid.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas was 10-15 years into the future witht he lyrics on this album.  With bars like \\"You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of refer/it's like Malcomb X catchin' the jungle fever.\\"  Although it doesn't have a ton of songs on it the songs that are on it are classics.  If you're a fan of music, you need to have this album in your collection.

Sure I already have an import version of the pilot, seasons 1 and 2, and the old VHS tapes, but it was the best show ever aired on television.

B000002B1M|5.0|This was Nas' sophmore album and still one of his best albums to date. After this album he took more of a \\"commercial or materialistic approach\\" which lasted until he released Stillmatic.  Stilmatic was when he went back to his more political style of music. This album is packed with classic tracks.  If you're a rap fan you will love this album.
B001AQT0OU|5.0|I'm sure the quality of this blu-ray will be great, like the other Kubrick movies on Warner Bros. I appreciate that you didn't make us true Kubrick fans wait or buy the whole box set when the only ones missing were Lolita and Barry Lyndon. I'm an early adopter and had the other Kubrick titles since 2007. Thanks Warner Bros for releasing this stand alone blu-ray!
B000UX6THK|5.0|Just be glad we are getting this awesome edition of it.  Yes, the cover art is bad too, but it has always been about the show itself (and the extras).  Giving less stars gives the show itself a lower rating which may hinder new fans wanting to get it.  Rate the show, not the previous DVDs you had to buy. Enjoy and relish it with a good hot cup of coffee.  Here's to someday getting the Fire Walk With Me deleted scenes edition DVD someday! PS(also enjoy the Season 2 soundtrack on 10/23!)
B000OQF6N6|4.0|First of all, one has to say that this is probably billy's best studio guitar performance of all time.  There are some truly deep textures and the guitar layers come in multitudes.    Where I find it lacks is in a couple areas:    First, the songwriting is not the same that is was, and Billy resorts to just being purely heavy to impress the listener, and don't get me wrong it works.  But the songwriting in the previous albums is far superior.    Newer bands like Muse or The Morning Code offer a stronger melodic foundation than some of what I heard on this.    Second, the vocal mix throughout the album is off.  As a musician myself, I'm used to doubled, nicely mixed vocals that sit well.  These certainly dont.    Besides that, all I have to add is that the ending of United States gives me goosebumps as the silence between the guitars shocks you into having goosebumps.  The album might be worth it just for that one song...

0143036556|4.0|Diamond hits pretty much on the mark all the way across the board.  Weakness:  for the most part ignores or minimizes the effect of marketing/advertising/propaganda on human consumption patterns.  Strengths:  one of the few books on this broad subject that actually deals with over-population; indeed, had he concentrated more on this one most important issue, I would have given \\"Collapse\\" 5 stars.    I would strongly recommend this book for anyone concerned with the future of the human race.
1401300529|4.0|David Halberstam is one of the great chroniclers of our times.  He has covered politics, business, media and sports but, according to his wife in a New York Times story about his unfortunate accident, Halberstam was proudest of his trilogy of war books ending with The Coldest Winter.    This book can also be read as a companion piece to The Fifties in which Halberstam tries to show how much more monumental that decade was than is ordinarily perceived.  In a June 2003 interview, the author describes the fifties decade as underreported because it was not a media era.  Since there was no television and, as a result, little visual record, there is not much reader appetite for the Korean War, said Halberstam.    In spite of this observation, the author approaches this story in his usual style. He has stated that \\"a writer should be like a playwright putting people on stage, putting ideas on stage, making the reader become the audience.\\"  He sets the scene in this book by describing \\"a puzzling, grey, very distant conflict.\\"  He puts Truman and McArthur before the reader and talks though America's reluctant movement away from isolationism as the result of WW II.  He describes how anti-Communism in Korea evolved into our opposition to nationalist efforts to throw off Colonialism in Viet Nam. The author then reaches back to MacArthur's father's experience in the American Civil War giving the reader a feel for how short a period of time passed while this massive growth in America's world role occurred.    I have a few small complaints.  The author sees North Korea's invasion as \\"an old-fashioned border crossing\\" that justified American response.  He quotes Dean Acheson saying that a refusal of Americans to act could lead to World War.  However, earlier in the book Halberstam shows how the 38th parrallel was an arbitrary, externally imposed line created \\"in the most casual way at the last minute at the Pentagon.\\"  He also refers to Kremlin archives which show the invasion wasundertaken at North Korean rather than Soviet initiative as Truman had mistakenly feared.    I also think that Halberstam's narrative rambles a bit more than usual.  In one span of 5 pages early in the book, he transitions from a discussion of MacArthur's attitude towards Korea to that country's geopolitical history.  He then notes the treaty in the Russo-Japanese War and veers into a description of Teddy Roosevelt's characterization of the Asian mind.  This allows the author to bring in Sygman Rhee's visit to TDR, then Rhee's relationship with President Wilson before this culminates in a discussion of the way in which Wilson spurned Rhee's participation at Versailles.  Whew.    All in all, I liked the book as I have liked all of Halberstam's work.  While not his best, it is very good and includes most of what the non historian needs to know about the Korean conflict and its impact on US foreign policy.
0385340559|2.0|Unfortunately, in my opinion, this book cannot be compared the The Hard Way.  That one was taut, thrilling and extremely gripping.  This one was drowning in minutiae, far too many 'filler' details.  It took 250 pages to even know what the characters were trying to stop. From then on, you just knew Reacher would get the bad guys and the climax was pretty standard 'shoot 'em up', no surprises or twists at all.  I expected so much more. Pass this one by.
B00005JNX0|4.0|This aired on HBO HD and I recorded it for my 2 year old son.  It was a hit.  It looks amazing!  I ordered it on amazon so I wouldn't have to keep it on our dvr.  The dvd doesn't look as good as HD though.  It is a very entertaining movie for adults as well as kids.  Has some funny stuff only adults will understand, but the story line is easy enough for the kids to follow.  My husband liked it as well.  The movie itself is gorgeous.  The colors and character designs are 5 Stars!
B00005JPRD|5.0|I was the age of the characters in the movie at the time the story took place. I went through the fears of going to war. I missed going by one week (I was next to go). I was stationed in Europe when Nixon issued an order that stopped military personnel from being transferred from Europe to Asia. I don't go to movies about Viet Nam. The reason I went to this one is, my oldest son is in it. He is one of the Blue People and appeared in the dance scene at the induction center. He didn't like the idea of being in a movie in underwear but he did it. I enjoyed Joe Cocker - he's one of my favorite singers from that time. Go see this movie with an open mind. If you're looking for a reenactment of Beatle music with their voices , this is not a movie for you. Don't look for a storyline that explains all aspects of every character in the movie - its a musical not an epic. Go see Joe Cocker, Bono and Salma Hayek. Listen to the music of this movie as though it was the first time you ever heard these songs.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is the best series I have ever seen.  I watched the entire first season in one setting.  There were flaws on the discs and I had to return them for hopefully a set without flaws, but I kept watching anyway.  I signed up for Showtime immediately thereafter to watch Season 2.
B000TUXL2A|4.0|Foreign films (and some domestic) possess the wonderful quality of refusing to \\"hit you over the head\\". When I've watched films such as \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\" or \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\", I remember what it's like to be invited to enter a world where life is, at once, wonderfully imaginative and starkly real.    Knopfler's story telling is both of these. He crafts tales of love and loss and of lifes'experience that, through successive listenings, (Sit down and read the lyrics simultaneously) draws you in and invites you to enter his characters'lives......or....is it someone he knew at some point?     For example, when he sings of the \\"Scaffolder's Wife\\" and the simple life of quiet desparation she seems to lead, it causes me to wonder where she and her husband's business was. Is it post WW2 London or Hersey, PA in 1959. What I mean to point out here is that this music and lyrics creates, for me, fertile ground for daydreaming.......and that's what it has in common with a finely crafted film. No \\"Fat Strat\\" solo dominating the scene like early Dire Straights. Just straight forward story telling at it's best with tasteful musical backup.    I enjoy many different forms of music. From Medesky, Martin and Woods to Alison Krauss. From the Flecktones to Tower of Power and Chick Corea, but I\\"ll always enjoy Mark Knopfler's easy baritone.     I look forward to your next film Mark.

B000RG1FMO|4.0|Kanye said it correctly. Truth be told, Kanye isn't very skilled as a lyricist, but if this is the future of mainstream hip-hop, I smile and I'm glad. Why would I want someone like Soulja Boy to rule when Kanye is still ripping the airwaves. Everyone has opinions, but just think about it for a moment. I'll come back to this.<br /><br />The album starts with a very freshing beat and some nice rhymes about school related things. Which leads to the decent Champion, talking about his life as a kid. Its short but paves way for the magnum opus, Stronger. Personally, I don't really like the sample. Kanye seeks in a few punches to the mainstream rappers. I Wonder just ruins the originally and powerful song by Labi Siffre. No flow and the beat doesn't do good for this style. Kanye: you are not a poet, so rap. The first 5 songs ends on a good note, flipping a MJ sample. Good Life is a very refreshing song, but T-Pain, semi-ruined the song.<br /><br />\\"la,la,la,la/Wait 'til I get my money right\\"; Kanye hit summer with a big  hit with an easily recognizable beat and rips it with his swagger flow. Barry Bonds looks like a last minute song, which should've been on a mixtape, because it doesn't flow with the album at all. Not to say it isn't good. I've seen reviews bashing this song, but the beat is great and Ye's and Wayne's verse are decent, more or less. Drunk and Hot Girls is arguably the worst song on the album, but its also the beat smoking/chill song on the album. Mos def should've left the T-Pain sound at home, it ruins it a bit. Good subject matter for a college 'themed' album. Flashing Lights is pretty good, but could've been done better.<br /><br />Next comes what is arguably the best track on the whole album, Everything I Am, mostly due to some nice lines and an awesome beat, which I hope a more talented rapper and shreds it. The Glory has a crazy sample but has vintage Kanye stealing other rappers' lines/songs. Atleast he doesn't overdue it with his big ego...oh wait. doh! Decent though. Homecoming recreates a classic Common song, which I hope ALL of you have heard. This Chris Martin guy does a good job on the chorus, but I would've prefer John Legend again. The track is nice to hear, I always like to hear rappers trying something different than the normal subjects. The albums ends on Big Brother. Honestly, the beat is a beast but Kanye doesn't rhyme for most of the song. Can't blame him, he got too much swag. The third verse is the best of the song and makes the song atleast above average with the beat.<br /><br />Before we go on, I wanna say I've listened to many classic (rap) albums, I know what's good, past or present. Don't worry, I'm no newbie at rap. I've been listening to rap since the mid 90s, the holy era for rap. So don't bash me for not knowing \\"good\\" rap. But...<br /><br />Kanye is one of the best producers in the last 5 and Blueprint was a great album due to him. I love him for bringing Common back to focus on BE. Like I said, if the mainstream is limited to Kanye, by all means, continue. I'll rather let Kanye rule it rather than Soulja Boy.<br /><br />Worth the purchase? Yes, yes it is if you're big in the mainstream and don't like underground rappers. Even hip-hop heads should look into this.<br /><br />3.5/5doh! Decent though.

The story is elequent. walking you though the being of a that has me biting at the bit till April 2008. Look at all the high ratings befoer this... You will love this book.
B000Q76K1A|1.0|While the movie is great, you only get 24 hours to view the film once you start watching it. I don't understand why there is such a short time frame to watch. Also, you have to watch it within about a month of downloading it. I didn't understand either of these limitations when I \\"purchased\\" it.
0156013983|5.0|I half-expected this book to be a children's book but it actually contained philosophical ideals people would often ask themselves in life. Highly recommended
B000ULQV0W|5.0|For all those Pearl Jam fans out there, the release of what is essentially a solo acoustic Eddie Vedder album is manna from heaven.  Of course, most PJ fans out there these days are in their 4th or 5th decade of life, and there are many young folks who view PJ as outmoded and other naysayers who have grown tired of Ed's gruff, mumbly baritone.  But I belong to the first group, so I think this little album is pretty great.    \\"Into the Wild\\" is a 30-minutish album that has Eddie playing a variety of acoustic instruments over 11 short tracks.  It's classic Vedder, but stripped-down and bare, kind of in the balladic \\"No Code\\" or \\"Binaural\\" vein with more acoustic strumming and minimal accompaniment.  The tunes were written as a movie soundtrack, and having seen the film, it's hard not to picture Emile Hirsch traipsing over hill and dale during the songs.  On the other hand, most of the numbers do have lyrics, which is a bit unusual for a soundtrack, and was sometimes distracting for me in the theater.  But this review is about the music...    Many of the tunes are upbeat, rocky-mountain-high, kind of anthems, as on \\"Setting Forth,\\" \\"Far Behind,\\" and the all-instrumental \\"Tuolumne.\\"  The other half are more introspective, balladic numbers (in keeping with the kind of celebration of freedom/wasteful tragedy duality of Chris McCandless' tale), as on the banjo-inflected \\"No Ceiling,\\" \\"Rise\\" (the ukelele invokes Ed's \\"Soon Forget\\" from Binaural or \\"Goodbye\\" from A Broke Down Melody -- I'm thinking an all uke-vocal album by Ed would be pretty great), \\"Long Nights,\\" \\"Society,\\" and \\"The End of the Road.\\"  \\"Hard Sun\\" is a stand-out in a number of ways -- clearly the one number that might either get radio-play or be released as B-side single.  Also, it's written by Robert Peterson (aka Indio) and features some backing chorus vocals by Sleater-Kinney frontwoman Corin Tucker (it would be awesome if Ed made a proper single out of \\"Modern Girl\\" and released it with \\"Hard Sun\\").  It's definitely the big anthem of the album and the only tune over 4 minutes long.  \\"Society\\" is the other track not written by Ed -- in this case, the author is Jerry Hannan who also sings back-up underneath.  \\"The Wolf\\" features Ed doing his Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan inspired vocal howling (reminiscent of \\"Arc\\" without the overdubs) over an organ drone.  And then there's \\"Guaranteed,\\" a great tune that really has two versions embedded in the same song -- first the vocal version that has Ed singing over acoustic guitar (this was played during the end credits of the movie) and later, in a \\"hidden track,\\" the \\"Humming Version\\" that starts around 4:40 after a minute or two of silence (who invented hidden tracks anyway?  why would I want to endure two minutes of silence or have to press fast forward to get to more music?).  The humming version is what opens the film, and features Ed humming the sweet soulful melody over the same guitar rhthym.  So for me, the standout tracks are \\"Hard Sun,\\" \\"Guaranteed,\\" \\"Setting Forth,\\" \\"Far Behind\\", \\"Rise,\\" and \\"The Wolf.\\"  That's half the album, so you can see I think it's all pretty great and will leave fans itching for a real solo album someday.    This review wouldn't be complete without some discussion about iTunes.  iTunes has available, for $2 more, the \\"deluxe version\\" of this album (NOT sold here at Amazon), which augments the original soundtrack with 4 more numbers -- \\"No More\\" (a cover) and \\"Photographs\\" (a short instrumental) lifted from the soundtrack to the documentary 'Body of War,' a live version of \\"No More,\\" and a live version of \\"Here's to the State,\\" one of Ed's concert staples that has him railing against various operatives in the Bush administration.  iTunes also sells \\"Guaranteed (Humming Version)\\" as a separate track, but it's just the \\"hidden track\\" from the 7-minute \\"Guaranteed\\" that isn't available as a single downloadable track.  Since the original soundtrack is only about a half-hour long, most fans will welcomethe extra 12 minutes of music, but the truth is the tunes don't completely fit with the rest of the album and some will no doubt find the strong political messages of \\"No More\\" (War) and \\"Here's to the State,\\" typical of Ed, tiring.    And so, \\"Into the Wild\\" is a short little album written as a movie soundtrack that is loaded with little gems by Eddie Vedder on vocals and acoustic strings.  If you like Ed and can put up with the brevity of the songs themselves and the album as a whole, it's sure to please, and leave you wishing there were more.  And there is a little more, only if you're interested you'll have to get it from iTunes... or somewhere else ;).
B00005JPRF|1.0|Frankly, I don't mind the resident evil movies, but I don't like them that much either but this third installment is just... lousy, of course the zombies look great and there are plenty of cool action shots etc, its a hollywood product so that can go without saying and since it should be expected doesn't play any role as to how I rated this film.  What I'm talking about is the total lack of any story, characters still so stupid they don't immediately aim for the head (though they finally have a few gooey headshots though no complete head splatters but the majority are the quick head jerk cut aways from resident evils past), and total lack of any sort of characterization aside from lining up for food, driving, searching for cigarettes or screaming while getting eaten that's it and even that's done on a completely generic level, I didn't care about any of the 1 dimensional characters, exactly as in the previous resident evil movies. The lack of any cool mutations showing up, as in the video games, is really disappointing though the evil scientist mutating into the monster from the end of the original video game did make me shout with glee, but too little too late.  Anyway this movie is definitely not worth seeing in theaters, it does nothing the other two didn't already do before and even when it throws in something seemingly new it's taken directly from the original resident evil video game (the crows and boss mutation) instead of at least using a more recent game, anyway shouldn't they have done that kinda thing earlier, you know in the first movie! Simply wait for it to come out on DVD and rent it if you just have to see it.
B00008BRBG|4.0|I enjoy all the songs on this one except \\"Born in the 50's\\" and \\"Be My Girl - Sally\\".  I like how the songs are so varied.  You get reggae with \\"So Lonely\\" and \\"Roxanne\\", punkish sounds with \\"Next To You\\" and \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\" and even some jazzy chords with \\"Hole In My Life\\"  Even on this first album you can tell these guys had a boat load of talent and Sting's songwriting was top notch.

B000UFAURI|2.0|First of all you have to realize that this \\"conspiracy theory\\" comes from my opinion that \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose\\" is far and away the best Foo Fighters album to date.  When I say \\"far and away\\" I'm talking like their other albums or pretty ok, but there's something magical happening on \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose.\\"<br />Now to the theory:<br />Shortly after Nirvana appeared on unplugged, Kurt sat down with Dave and shared with him some new material he wanted his imput on.  He wanted some help with the arrangements and harmonies and what have you.  Well it wasn't long after all this that Kurt Cobain committed suicide leaving Dave with nothing but the shells of all these amazing songs which he took upon himself to bring to life.  Now, arranging these songs and playing them and recording them took a little while and this is why they released two albums prior to Nothing Left to Lose.  \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose\\" is comprised of all the songs Kurt Cobain had planned to record but unfortunately didn't get the chance to.  Go back and listen to the album again, can't you just hear Kurt singing those songs?<br />REMINDER THAT ALL OF THIS IS BASED ON ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.<br />So why wait until this album to reveal this?  Because I was hoping I was wrong.  I heard a lot of great things about ESP&G before I listened to it, but was once again left wondering where the amazing songs were.  I have yet to hear another song of theirs that even comes as close to being as great as any of the songs on \\"Nothing Left to Lose.\\"  It's the only thing that makes sense.  It's like which one of these things doesn't belong:<br />Foo Fighers - ok<br />The Colour and the Shape -ok<br />There is nothing Left to Lose - un freaking believable<br />One by One - ok<br />In your honor - ok<br />ESP&G - ok<br /><br />I'm just saying.
B0000026UV|4.0|Listening to Knopfler and Atkins exchange riffs one after the other is a treat!  The reparte between the two is as enjoyable.  'I'm only a part-time saint,' Atkins says.  Ha! 'Ah...you've played before!' says Knopfler. 'Don't make your elders look bad!' from Atkins...<br /><br />The idea of a younger picker playing with an older (well, at the time of the CD anyway) makes for fun listening.  It's bittersweet seeing as Chet Atkins is gone.<br /><br />Brilliant?  Guess not.  I'm not even sure what that would mean.  An essential CD if you're at all interested in great guitar and guitar pickers?  Yep!!

B000E5N62U|4.0|I don't know!  You could not get more concise rhythms, phrase, and performance out of machine. 'Morph' is as strange as Nightfly and Kamakiriad ..which means it's trademark Fagen.  The minor keyed, somewhat freestyled reprise on the last track is a hoot!  Don't expect to hear even 1/2 of what's on this CD if your idea of a stereo is that SoundDesign 8-track unit with the fake horns glued onto the speaker baffle you've had for thirty years.  This CD takes some serious current and slew speed.  If you're a Fagen fan, you likely have a Mac, Crown, or some other 'real' equipment that won't disappoint...this CD sure doesn't!!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen most productions done of Jane Eyre and this one was, by far, one of the better productions I have seen. The cinematography was beautiful and Rochester was more likeable and not as harsh as the other actors who have played him through the years. It makes for a more believable scenario that Jane would actually fall in love with him.<br /><br />I am very glad I purchased it and I will purchase more as gifts for friends and family. I just wish they would make more excellent productions like this.
B000RL4GS4|5.0|Growing up in the 1980's was a treat, because of the music. Bands like AC/DC, Scorpions, LA Guns, Billy Idol were staples on rock radio and MTV. Pop music had a sense of direction, and there was no self-loathing in the lyrics. This band, Airbourne, is a modern reincarnation of early AC/DC and Bad Company, and it hits hard from the get go. The melodies and riffs don't let up, and wow do these songs stay in your head all day! \\"Runnin' Wild\\" is the best hard rock song to be released in years, and yes it is the one from the Madden 2008 soundtrack. I purchased this album from an mp3 store but I enjoyed it so much I want the original artwork. There is not a dull moment on this entire CD. It is like stepping into the best moments of 1980's hair metal WITHOUT leaving 2007. The music has a bass-heavy, modern vibe to it, and it is not at all pretentious and it DOESN'T TRY TOO HARD!!! The Darkness and Buck Cherry will be an afterthought once this band hits it big in the US. This CD has renewed my faith in sensible melodic hard rock, and it stands as my lone hard rock album of the 2000's that I consider a classic along the lines of AC/DC's \\"Back In Black,\\" Van Halen's debut album, Metallica's \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" Guns n Roses' \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" and most notably Def Leppard's \\"Hysteria.\\"

B00005JPFH|3.0|Incidentally, the 2-disc release has a second disc filled with featurettes called 1) Grains of Sand -- Building Sandman; 2) Re-Imagining the Goblin; 3) Covered in Black -- Creating Venom; 4) Hanging On ... Gwen Stacy and the Collapsing Floor; 5) Fighting, Flying & Driving -- The Stunts; 6) Tangled Web: The Love Triangles of Spider-Man 3; 7) Wall of Water; 8) On Location Cleveland -- The Chase on Euclid Avenue; 9) On Location New York -- From Rooftops to Backstreets; 10) The Science of Sound; and 11) Inside The Editing Room. Sony claims that the dual-disc release has over six hours of supplemental material.<br /><br />I admit that Spidey 3 was a disappointment, especially making Peter Parker some goofy goth kid and kaving him do a dance routine..... how about DARKNESS?  Like, making him actually EVIL?  Ah, well......  they should have learned from past franchises to not have more than two villains.  Still, it's Spidey.  They haven't screwed it up so badly that I won't go back for more.  Which had BETTER be the Lizard this time!!!!!
0385512058|5.0|What a wonderful read!<br /><br />At the core of this entertaining book are Keith's suggestions how to build a powerful network of friends and acquaintances. He starts out reasoning that you won't make it (or at least have a real hard time) in today's business world without contacts. What makes him really likeable though is his twist on the motivation and how to approach it. It is clear that he despises the calculating networking jerks that are just out to take something from a new relationship, but are not willing to give anything. On the contrary, his advise is to stretch out to others and offer your help, your advise where you have expertise, and your existing contacts to do the other a favor, and not ask and not even expect anything in return. He argues that return favors will come automatically and plentiful, without you asking for it (through your network, not necessarily from every person you ever helped).<br /><br />As a personal advise to anybody's development, he offers a three step plan (sounds familiar). Only in the last step he suggests to actively look for people who can help you achieve your goals, and start networking so that you get to know them.<br /><br />All throughout the book Keith parts with his incredible wealth of knowledge how to handle the most common situations on your mission to create your network, like dealing with the secretaries of powerful people (the gatekeepers), how to warm cold calls, following up, or the art of small talk. I have to say that I discovered many interesting tips that I had not heard or read before. Meanwhile, Keith is really entertaining, and this pearl never gets boring. There is so much information contained about how to start relationships, how to maintain them, and on principle how to be a people attractor that it will take quite a while for anybody to put all these principles to good use.<br /><br />I admit that some of it may be too intense, and if you are not necessarily inclined or motivated to become a Fortune 500 CEO, some of the material sounds like overkill. Nevertheless, there are many aspects presented and advise given that apply to regular human interactions as well, and if studied and applied should help you become a better communicator and people attractor.

1552091090|5.0|I bought this book years ago for my children who are now adults. We have since bought this book for every member of our family/ extended family. We write the main saying in the book on all our correpondences to each other. It is even on the flower holder at our parent's memorial. It is such an expression of pure love to all family members.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is one of the most amazing documentaries that I've seen.  The picture quality is stunning.  Definitely worth buying to show off your High Def. set up at home.  The pictures are even amazing looking on a standard def. television.
0553805460|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  It was not only enjoyable, but a very fast read.  What an incredible story!  I will recommend this book to all of my friends.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is now one of my very favorite movies!!  The acting was wonderful and am especially fond of the actor Richard Armitage. His character in the movie seems particularly harsh but as the story envelops you see more and more the tenderness of his heart.  The movie very well portrayed the cultural differences between 19th century Northern and Southern England, between the different social classes, and that there are two sides to every situation.  It was packed with tension and passion and I fell in love with all the characters in the story.  Unlike many period piece dramas of the same time period they were not concerned as much with shallow and material things as they were about more significant things such as other people and overcoming poverty with hard honest work.  The author made the characters seem REAL still having their flaws but all the while still not being quite as silly and trivial as you will find in other such movies.  I definitely recommend this movie to all BBC period piece lovers and was very glad to find the movie Family friendly as well!!!
0060578793|5.0|With the new tv shows showing actual survival skills in the wild my family and I have developed a real interest in this topic.  I am enjoying the book.  It was written in a very easy and understandable way.  I feel confident that with this book by my side that I could survive quite well in a variety of situations.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This movie is beautiful. I saw it in the theatre twice and although I usually don't buy many DVD's, I cannot wait to get this one. I only wish Hollywood would do more films like this. It is uplifting, motivating, and educational. Oh, and Ioan Gruffudd is beautiful.  BTW the companion book \\"Amazing Grace\\" by Eric Metaxas is superb and will answer the many questions you'll have about Wilberforce and his story after watching this movie.
0887307280|3.0|\\"And a silver belt buckle with his initials in green jade acrosss in face. ... Can you see it?  Do you get the picture?\\"  And no, he is not out of business.      For me it is a number of good ideas and a hard sales pitch.  Next time less pitch more workout please.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I LOVE this album...well, the first disk is much better than the second; but very pleased. A really great sampling of a lot of the old and newer talents.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I went to see Amazing Grace with the teens of my church as a chaperon. I did not really know what to expect with the exception that I was told it was about the abolition of slavery in England. What a great story for all to learn that it was the Anglos in England who were amongst the first to abolish slavery. It is not a story we hear much about. Wilberforce got religion as they say. His mentor, John Newton, who wrote the hymn 'Amazing Grace,' taught him about what slavery was. In the theatrical version of the story, Wilberforce wanted to go into the ministry. Newton suggests to him his calling is to free the slaves, to make that his life's work.<br /><br />Oh that we had such passion for the things of this life today. I liked it becaused it showed about the potential in man to accomplish great things if he has a heart. I am a believer in God, yet, not a religionist. Religion, sometimes, causes more difficulty because it is so much like men and not like the God that it is attached to. Wilberforce lived his religion. Who knows though, maybe he was an enlightened soul, who really was against the crown, or maybe he really saw the commonalities between himself and the Jacobites in France. He was able to hold forth in his battle in the Parliament.<br /><br />It is a story like no other in recent times. I hope that more come to see it, that it gets its time in the media. We never really heard much about it. It is a story for everyone. Historical, with a strong ethic for the love of mankind. Wilberforce and his story will inspire people to stand for what they believe. In the times we live in today, it is rare for people to stand up for what is right. Wilberforce is an example of almost unwavering commitment to a cause.<br /><br />The world was better for his efforts, I think you will be better for seeing, Amazing Grace. I am getting the DVD.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|This leaves little room for criticism in the quality of animation. Human and animal motion are quite convincing, and cloth and hair effects have never been better. The gray grunge of a crumbling urban world comes through well - sometimes the subdued palette tells the story better than brighter colors could. The only disappointment in the animation came towards the end, when people's hair and clothes were immersed in water. I was waiting to see how the animators would present it. Apparently, the characters all use a shampoo based on Scotch-Guard, so their locks remained loose and wispy even after complete immersion. Likewise, clothes soaked in water never took on the waterlogged look I hoped for. Still, the animation stands at the peak of current technology.<br /><br />On top of that, I applaud the ecological consciousness of this movie. It uses 100% recycled plot elements; no new ideas were harmed in the making of it. Big cool motorcyles, oddly oversized and elaborate weaponry, flying-swordsman fight scenes, earth at risk from man's greed, super-secret government lab creating the ultimate warrior - you get the idea.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching this once. I can't think of any reason to see it again.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B000UR366S|5.0|This is turning out to be Joni Mitchell's year.  First we got a fascinating (if hit-or-miss) tribute to Joni Mitchell featuring the likes of Annie Lennox, James Taylor, Prince and k. d. lang.  Now, comes a double delight in Herbie Hancock's RIVER:  THE JONI LETTERS and this wonderful new work by the woman herself.  I strongly recommend picking up both Hancock and Mitchell discs at the same time.  They work almost as a pair.  Tina Turner's rendition of \\"Edith and the Kingpin\\" is particularly illuminating, as it is not only a fine performance by all concerned, but we have not heard the jazz side of Tina Turner much, if ever.  Hancock also covers two other artists who have been important to Mitchell, and while there are other guest vocalists, some of the tunes are moving instrumental versions of her songs.  Joni also guests on a startling remake of \\"The Tealeaf Prophecy\\" done in a purely jazz setting.  If Hancock's JONI LETTERS expresses the improvisational side of Joni, SHINE finds her in a relaxed atmosphere of pop, jazz and folk stylings, fleshed out with lush orchestrations and varied rhythms.  In a lesser artist's hands, some of this new material might come off as preachy, but as always, Joni says it all in the service of the music, and gorgeous music it is... and while venting and lamenting, there is a surprising note of hope in many of these songs.  It's not all darkness; Joni points out more than once the distant light at the end of the tunnel, which manifests itself in the notion that human beings have it within their power to change the world for the better.  Welcome back Joni:  may you never leave us!
075640407X|5.0|I first came across Name of the Wind as an excerpt for a book club I was participating in.  They were kind enough to give me about 15 pages of Chapter 9, but it was so enthralling that I just HAD to have the book!  This is a hefty book, but don't let that dissuade you.  It's a quick read (at least it was for me!) because the characters are so realistic that you're instantly drawn into their world.    Some have said this is the next boy wizard book, but I really think this one stands on it's own - expertly combining myth, fiction, and imagination.  Rothfuss does an exceptionally talented job of creating characters that you're instantly connected to, who you want to know more about.  I was instantly transported into Kvothe's world, feeling his emotions and thoughts as easily as if I were watching a movie or experiencing them myself.  That kind of story-telling is hard to do and Patrick does it excellently.    I am anxiously awaiting the next in the series.  This will definitely make good TV/movie material, since there isn't much that needs to be done to bring it to the screen.  Patrick's writing style is superb and I whole-heartedly recommend reading anything he's written.  I've recommended this book to several friends, all of whom read it up just like I did, and they have all been recommending it to others - so it's not just me that thinks it's wonderful!      Buy the book, you won't be disappointed!
1844137864|5.0|Banksy, with its misterious aura, brings to the face of the society those things the society itself hides under the tapestry (as perfectly illustrated in his book). Even more if we're talking about Great Britain, or America.      Those that live in \\"3rd world\\" countries like Brazil (myself included) can appreciate even more this masterpiece of urban intervention. A must-have. Specially for the narrow-minded, conservative ones.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I loved the cameo by the Kill Bill Sheriff and his #1 son, along with the Kill Bill cell phone. And don't forget Zoe Bell was the one who was actually blasted in the Kill Bill 2 shotgun blast and spent months in the hospital, and she did the real fighting in Budd's trailer.     There's really lots to this movie, and it only sunk in with repeat viewing.  If you are a Tarantino fan and you deny yourself this movie you are missing something.  I expect a lot of the complaints come from people who do not appreciate Tarantino dialog, and his unique homage style, or aren't familiar with the films he is homaging here (Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, White Line Fever, Vanishing Point, The Road Warrior, etc.) Do yourself a favor, watch these movies, then watch Death Proof 3-4 times and then write your reviews.  This is a great movie.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|-- The Good --  The animation was wonderful, the backdrops amazing, the planes cool, the characters fascinating, but ...    -- The Bad --  The story of Porco Rosso is - well, undercooked. Several interesting storylines were started (and some were vaguely hinted at) during the course of the movie, but only a couple of these treated with the care they needed and deserved. It almost seemed as though the writers had too many ideas for the budget to handle. Just as things began to approach spiral-sliced honey ham perfection the film rudely ends. It's sort of a let down. Oh well, the dogfights were fun, and Porco's fist fight with Curtis at the end of the film was mildly amusing. Soooo much more could have been done with this film.     -- The Ugly --  I expected a bizarre mixed up story with a peacenik or environmental message - since Ghibli is good at that sort of drivel. I also expected some kind of weird spiritual journey. At least part of my expectations were met. The viewer was given a healthy troughful of anti-war goodness and plenty of \\"ugly American\\" stereotyping.    -- The Other White Meat --  Porco is some pig, no doubt! I'd say that he's the best chain-smoking, wine-swilling pig-man seaplane pilot in the whole universe! I did find it odd that he had such a broad social network since he's supposed to be the consummate loner, and, well, a PIG!    -- Final Analysis --  Porco Rosso is a visually stunning film. It's entertaining, a little strange, and most definitely undercooked.
B000092T6M|2.0|Watching this movie is rather like seeing an episode of \\"Star Trek: Voyager\\". You know it's going to be fairly bland, fairly dull and fairly uninteresting. You hope there might be a few scenes worth watching, but overall you know you're likelt to forget the movie as soon as you are done with it. Likely you won't think it was good or bad. Just that it WAS and beyond that... meh.    This early-90's, multi-cultural film has little in common with the far superior [[ASIN:B00005JKEZ The Adventures of Robin Hood (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. It has some of the same characters and some of the same plot, but it parts company with the Robin Hood legend early on and doesn't look back.    I'm sure you're familiar with the basic plot. Robin Hood gets pissed off at the Norman nobility and goes on a rampage, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. He thwarts the wiles of the evil Prince John and his minion, the Sheriff of Notingham, whil at the same time winning the heart of the lovely Maid Marion.    Some of that is even in this movie!    Of course, Prince John is left out, as is the famous archery competition. Added in is a completely useless Moorish character who had no place in the film and does not appear at all in the Robin Hood legends. Clearly he was added in some pointless attempt to make the movie more, shall we say, colorful (the same reason we have a sub-Saharan African character in [[ASIN:B0009QTS1M Gladiator - Extended Edition (Three-Disc Extended Edition)]], though at least in that case we aren't butchering a legendary story to add him in. This is like throwing a Mongol character into \\"Beowulf\\").    There are some good things about the movie. The SFX and battles are decent. Alan Rickman chews up so much scenery one expects to find teeth marks in all the sets. Sean Connery's appearance is welcome and interesting.    But otherwise... meh.

1591841666|2.0|The book boils down to these obvious principles:    (1) Don't waste time at dead end careers/projects/tasks/etc.    (2) Dedicate yourself to be the best in a worthy endeavor.    (3) If you are not willing sacrifice it all to be the best or do not have the resources to make it as the best, then don't even start because it is a very competitive world and you'll waste your time.    The author spends nearly 3/4 of the book pointing out that to achieve anything worthwhile, one has to slug it out through a long stretch of steady work that seems like a plateau.  He also points out that dead-end careers are those that have have reached a plateau.  *But he offers no clue as to how to tell the two apart!*  Nor does he offer any suggestions on to how to attain the prescience of whether or not you have the right resources/personality/etc for succeeding in the task at hand; he simply waves his hand and says that if you can't make it through, just don't do it from the start.  But wait, there is more...after all his lecture about not quiting and dedicating yourself to finishing, at the end of the book he gives the example of best selling author, Michael Crichton who after finishing Harvard Medical School just quit medicine and went on to become an author without any certainty of being good at it.  This despite his constant advice of \\"not switching queues at the check out counter lest you spend all your time in the line up!\\"    I am feeling generous and am giving this book a 2 because it was short enough to finish on the commute from work.  It is a pity that Seth Godin did not listen to his own advice and write the best book on the subject.
0307346609|5.0|For those of you thinking this will be a tongue in cheek ironic laugh of a book, let me tell you that this is not the case.  It is writen in a serious, insightful and journalistic style, perfect for the topic.  He has great ideas about how all this might take place, and there are some truly moving parts of this book, as well as the horrible and violent.  Do you like end of the world scenarios?  Grab this book!
B000J10ERO|1.0|If Batman Begins taught us anything it's that the best thing to do with a trashed comic book franchise is start again. Superman was crying out for a restart, instead we got Superman Returns, a movie that claims heritage from the first two WB movies and winds up being a remake of the Christopher Reeve original but with better effects.    Unlike the original however, Superman Returns is stuck with a director that cannot handle the character, or colour it would appear. Supermans uniform is repeatedly dulled down to greys and blacks throughout the movie and his lines are countable on one hand.     Instead of the worlds greatest hero returning from some far flung battle on the edge of the known universe, we have a guy who nipped home, found it blown up (DUH! Didn't his pop tell him this already in the first movie?) and then turned around and came straight back.     Upon returning he finds Lois involved with another guy and saddled with a kid. Problem is... these stories go nowhere. The guy is quite a nice chap actually and the kid is a mop-haired nothing who really doesn't have a role in the movie. In fact, most of the seeming plot points in the movie never actually go anywhere. At one point Supes dies, everyone mourns, and then suddenly he's alive again with no explanation and no reason. Is he like tinkerbell? Everyone claps their hands and wishes he was okay and he is? The whole thing doesn't reach any kind of conclusion; Superman sort of saves the day from a really badly conceived Lex Luthor plot (that's much like the one in the first movie), dies, comes back and flies away at the end, shot-for-shot like Christopher Reeve did in the original movie but there's no sense that he's accomplished anything. The movie just runs out of steam and ends.    This is another case of a movie franchise that could've gone through the roof but was fouled up by WB, who aparantly couldn't get away from the success of the original and the ghost of Christopher Reeve. Times have changed, the Superman/Clark Kent character has matured considerably in the comics becoming an icon of heroism and justice within the law instead of becoming another Batman clone, as some would have him be.     Sadly, it's very unlikely we'll ever see that character portrayed on the slver screen which is both our loss and Warner Brothers.

1569242739|5.0|I served some of these cupcakes up to some non-vegan friends at a party and was immediately accosted for the recipe!  None of them believed me that they were vegan cupcakes!  Now they all demand that I make cupcakes every time we get together.    This book is so easy to follow.  I'm a terrible baker...can cook a 5 course gourmet meal but can't bake to save my life.  So if MY cupcakes come out fantastic, than ANYONE can use this cookbook!  I've even gone out and bought decorating tips for icing and other cupcake making accessories because I love the recipes so much that I'm baking at least once a week now.    I would highly recommend this book to anyone as a staple of your kitchen, especially if you have children.  Now my son and I have our own cake to bring with us so he can have cake and ice cream at parties!
B00068NVI4|5.0|I'm very surprised that some of the reviewers don't like this DVD.  The performances are absolutely amazing.  Some reviewers have stated that Anderson is in the spotlight the whole time and the band members aren't given any time to show off their capabilities.  I don't see that at all except maybe on the beginning of Rhythm of Love when Anderson goes into the audience.  Okay, that's part of one song.  And maybe the acoustic set turned out to be a disappointment for some but I don't see it as a disappointment at all.  I think this DVD is absolutely spectacular.  The performances of South Side Of The Sky, Starship Trooper, Yours Is No Disgrace, You're Move/I've Seen All Good People, Ritual, And You And I, Turn Of The Century, Sweet Dreams, Mind Drive, and even their version of Every Little Thing are all amazing.  Even the acoustic set is incredible.  It shows how brilliant a band really is if they could successfully play some of their songs acoustically.  They do a fantastic job with Long Distance Runaroud, Wonderous Stories, The Meeting, Owner Of A Lonely Heart, Time Is Time, Show Me, and Steve Howe's performance of Second Initial.  Even Roundabout works quite well acoustically.  The camera work is also very good and you get plently of shots of the band members.  Howe (my favorite member) is such an incredible guitarist and you get to see how brilliant he is on electric, acoustic, lap steel, and that other guitar that he uses on Your Move and Wonderous Stories.  You also get to see and hear how Wakeman is a keyboard wizard and is one of the best keyboardists ever.  He does a great job on his regular keyboards during the regular parts of the set and is also brilliant on the piano during the acoustic set.  One great thing about this DVD that is a problem with Yes Live at Montreaux (which is still fantastic) is that you get to see a lot more of Squire.  Not only is Squire a fantastic bassist and backing singer, but he is also the only founding member of Yes who has never left the band.  You get to see and hear how great of a bass player Squire is and how important his backing vocals are.  Some Yes fans seem to prefer Bruford on drums over White, but White is just as good as Bruford ever was.  Plus, it shows that White has been in the band a lot longer than Bruford was so it obviously has worked better with White.  Remember, White was once played drums for John Lennon, and there is no way that Lennon would have allowed White to drum for him if he wasn't any good.  White is an amazing drummer and his drums on South of the Sky alone justify his importance to the band.  Anderson has an amazing voice and it's fantastic that he still can sing as high as he can.  As a band, their playing is just as good, if not better, as it was years ago and you definitely get to witness the virtuosic musicianship of all the band members (especially Howe, Squire, and Wakeman).  This is a fantastic DVD and I strongly recommend it.
B000UGG39Q|4.0|As a disclaimer: I have only listened to this record about 10 times, so it's still pretty early to be writing a review. It often takes me many listens to appreciate all the nuances of a particular record. That being said, first impressions are usually a good starting point, so here are mine: I understand that it's become a 'political' issue to compare Down with Pantera, but as a previous reviewer mentioned, this record does remind me, strictly sonically, more of Pantera than Down's previous two albums. There's more consistency here than on Down II. Meaning that the production on Down III is more even (and there's just more of it, too.) It's almost as if, compared to the other records, the guitars and everything are in 'slow motion.' David Fricke's 4 star review in Rolling Stone compared Phil's vocals to James Hetfield, and I can kinda see that. The vocals definitely aren't as raw as they could be. I've always loved Phil's voice and everyone has copied it over the years... but I think the production does slightly take away from it, and the album in general. it's so hard to make any criticism of such talented artists, but even when the riffs are really pounding, somehow it just doens't match the energy level of \\"Ghosts Along the Mississippi\\" or \\"Bury Me in Smoke.\\" I suppose people are saying this record sounds more mature because the band members themselves are in a different place - more mature. It seems like they put in a lot of hard work on this. Phil seems really committed to the making of this record and really into the music (based on his blog entries.) He seems to be a more centered person, perhaps even a bit spiritual. All of that is awesome - and it's reflected in the sounds on Down III, so the whole thing just seems somehow a bit more even keeled. The same signature sound is maintained, and there are bluesy moments as on Down II. The guitars on this are just AMAZING, some similar riffs to Pantera. Maybe not as melodic as the second album (fine by me.) Overall this is a GREAT record and a million times better than 99% of what I have heard this year. On its own I think this record would please everyone more universally, but the problem persists of people comparing it to Down's previous work which is just impossible to top... as a random example: kind of like when Radiohead made OK Computer, then had to follow it up.... a tall order.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Well, initially I had a similar problem with this DVD that other reviewers were having since High Hopes and Coming Back To Life were skipping.  However, I exchanged it and so far there aren't any problems.  There must be a few defective DVDs out there.  I still watched the rest of the defective DVD of course.  Putting all that aside, this DVD is just incredible.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that it is better than Pulse (which I also love).  I feel in this DVD, you get a much clearer picture of what a brilliant guitarist and musician Gilmour is.  He is one of the best guitar players ever and you get plenty of close ups of him playing the guitar.  The focus is on Gilmour and the band playing the music instead of the visualization that exhibits Pulse.  Yes, there are many lighting effects but I feel that they don't distract the viewer from the brilliance of the performance.  The music is outstanding.  Great performances of Time, Breathe, Echoes, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Wish You Were Here, Comfortably Numb, High Hopes, Coming Back To Life, Fat Old Sun, Arnold Layne, and On An Island in its entirety.  This DVD even has alternate versions of most of the songs plus a great version of \\"Wots..Uh the Deal.\\"  While the album On An Island isn't as good as the best albums by Floyd, it is still a fantastic album and it is even better when Gilmour performs it live.  A definite plus for this DVD is the fact that Gilmour had Wright with him so you get half of Pink Floyd performing.  Those two have always been the best MUSICIANS in Pink Floyd anyway.  Waters is a very gifted songwriter but I wouldn't call him an outstanding bassist since Gilmour played many of the complicated bass parts for many Floyd songs.  Other highlights of this DVD include the tour documentary and the documentary of the making of On An Island.  You even get to witness Gilmour and Waters talking to each other and shaking hands although they both looked a little uncomfortable.  Mason even has a cameo apperance.  I also must add that you get to see the band play the intro to Time (instead of having to watch the clock video), you get to see the musicians play High Hopes (instead of having to watch that video like on the Pulse performance), and you get to see much more of Gilmour's second solo on Comfortably Numb.  I can't say enough about the brilliance of this DVD.  It has turned into one of my favorite DVDs in a matter of only a few days.  If your a fan of David Gilmour and Pink Floyd, you will love this DVD.  Also, for those of you who support Waters over Gilmour, remember that even though Waters was responsible for many of the Floyd's compositions, Gilmour (and Wright) was the best musician in the band and also the best singer.  He's the one who played all those brilliant guitar parts and he's the one who sang classics like Time (with Wright), Money, Breathe, Welcome to the Machine, Us and Them, Wish You Were Here, Echoes (with Wright), and many more.  Buy this DVD.  It is absolutely incredible.

B000K4WPCC|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out.  My overall thoughts were it wasn't that bad.  Granted, it's not stellar, but, it could be worse.  It's a very interesting story that centers around the Salem Witch Trials, but in this case, all the witches are male.  Interesting twist!  If you're worried about being scared, or grossed out, none of that occurs here.  Sure, there are a few startling scenes that may make you jump, but it's subtle and not overdone enough to drown out the overall storyline.  It has a creepy vibe at certain points and rightfully so.    They chose an excellent cast, each cast member could actually act and, they aren't too bad on the eyes either.    I will warn you.  There is one horrible line in the movie that made pretty much everyone in the audience cringe, and then laugh.  \\"I'm going to make you my wiotch.\\"  Yes, it's true...    I also recommend picking up the soundtrack.  There's some pretty great songs on there.

Unreal! Love it!    Not sure what the one guy was doing, but ... to each his own. Don't let him discourage you, it's still 100 percent Down, baby!

B000SZLSB2|4.0|Lets call it 4.5 stars when compared with what else is out there these days, but he set the bar too high for himself (a good thing) which is why I feel I can judge him a little more strictly. As the Amazon review states, if you're over 35 (or a, ahem, classic rock lover), you'll pick up on tons of subtle musical and lyrical references to a genre that appeared lost until now. There's Queen, Elton John, Pink Floyd, The Doors, The Bee Gees, less Hendrix in this than Beatles this time around, plus some chord changes reminiscent of Billy Joel. The newer influences appear to be from Dave Matthews Band, Counting Crows and Coldplay.    The Barry Gibb similarities are there and, personally, I prefer Blunt's raspier shifts between the falsetto and the Englishman than the full-time falsetto. It almost sounded like his voice wasn't up to his own standards when he made the recordings and that falsetto, for him, is the easier way out. The first few verses in the live Amazon video are more like Blunt's old stuff but then slips into repetitive falsetto again. My mind keeps thinking that I knew what he MEANT to do in the song as I listen and, when paired with the wonderful words and music, its still great stuff. Hey James, you're not Barry Gibb and shouldn't settle for that sound: bring back a little more soul and character to your voice to match your lyrics and melodies in a live album with these same songs and this ones to the moon again (ie, Blue Oyster Cult-style live stuff). Still better than what else is out there and the more I listen the better it gets. Its in there.
B000002B7S|4.0|Ozzy Osbourne is a household name for everyone interested in music, and for everyone that has had a slight interest in entertainment news in the last decade. \\"Bark at the Moon\\" was his third solo album after being fired from \\"Black Sabbath\\", and his first studio release after the death of friend and band member Randy Rhoads, a young talented guitar player that died in a bizarre accident in the early 80's.    Musically Osbourne takes the first steps towards commercial success with this album. Although the music is still heavy metal; with a mix of fast riffing and drawn out chords creating the central soundscapes; subtle effects were used to make this record accessible to people outside the relatively small heavy metal fan base. The guitars are put back a bit in the mix, making them less dominant in the soundscapes. The guitar sound comes across as rather slick, without many raw edges. In addition, the synth is used to some extent in most tracks, creating a slightly softer overall sound.  But the main reason for the slight commercial success of \\"Bark at the Moon\\" were the inclusion of two ballads; where one of them (So Tired) started climbing the charts in Europe. A very melodic piece with extensive use of synths and what sounds like orchestra instruments gave the song an originality that was noticeable at the time it was released.    Special mention has to be given to the slight confusion as to just what songs that makes up this album. The album was originally released with 8 songs; but with a slight difference in what songs that were on the release depending on continent and country. And the track listing was different from edition to edition; and added to that some of the songs had different names on different releases as well. On the various releases of this album 10 different songs are used, and 12 different song titles.    The version that forms the basis for this release is the 8 song release with \\"Rock and Roll Rebel\\" as the starting track, \\"Forever\\" as track5 (named \\"Centre of Eternity\\" on some versions), and \\"Spiders\\" as the last track (known as \\"Spiders in the Night\\" on some releases, and in other releases replaced with the track \\"Slow Down\\").    The only slightly weak track on this release is opening track \\"Rock and Roll Rebel\\"; a nice rocker but somewhat anonymous and bland. The rest of the tracks here are all good, with the highlight for me being \\"Now You See It (Now You Don't)\\", a good metal tune where the synths are used effectively to create and enhance the mood and atmosphere of the song.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Nikki Sixx and his song writing so I knew this cd would be great and it is.  I listen to it all the time. I love all the songs and the narratives through the cd are very moving.
B000063DHL|4.0|Iron Maiden's sixth studio album \\"Somewhere in Time\\" is a heavily discussed album by fans of this legendary English band. It was very original in its day, as the band switched to synth guitars on this album and were among the first band to use that instrument in a way that enhanced their sound. At the same time the synth sounds alienated many fans, of which quite a few would say that this album showed a band in creative and musical decline.    Musically the band has perfected their sound on this album. The playing is tighter than the proverbial duck's arse, and the band members are experienced enough to add the extra touches to ordinary tunes to make them sound good, adding small nuances and touches in turn to make the songs sound interesting; as can best be heard on opening track \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\".  Adding the synth sounds to the music also elevates many tracks from the realm of the ordinary to something better, where the slightly softer edges of the synth guitar riffs adds flavout and atmosphere to Iron Maidens trademark harmonic and melodic soloing and riffing, and giving a warmer touch to Maidens pacey songs, where the fast paced bass guitar and drumming do sound better accompanied by the slightly softer synth guitars.    A new aspect to Iron Maiden's sound on this album, or at least an aspect much developed here, are several examples of songs where Bruce Dickinson's vocals are used as a melodic instrument in itself. These songs are rather monotone and repetitive apart from the soloing, and Dickinson's vocals carry as good as all melody in the singing parts of these songs. \\"Wasted Years\\" is a very good example of this. If this is planned or more an indirect result of the synth guitars slighter fuzzy sound is of course something that only can be speculated upon.    The influence from progressive rock continues on this album as well; an aspect of their music surfacing on their previous studio album \\"Powerslave\\". As with that album, in many songs the progressive elements are more to be found in structure than in actual playing; and the elements are most noticeable in the long, epic tracks on this release.    The individual songs on \\"Somewhere in Time\\" are a rather mixed affair. Although musically at their peak now in my opinion, the songs as such aren't as good as on previous albums. The creative well seems to have run dry; with fewer songs than normal containing original or really captivating elements.    The addition of the synth guitars to their sound as well as the band members ability to play on individual and collective strengths are the factors that elevate this album to an interesting, albeit varied, release.    Personal favorites: \\"Sea of Madness\\", \\"Deja Vu\\", \\"Alexander the Great\\"
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|This is surely one of the most memorable tv series I have seen. Who would have believed that one could fall for a serial killer, an anti-hero to literaly die for. Dexter is a complex character, who charms at the same time that he can freak you out. The DVD is a great buy, and a good addition to a collection of the best of Amerian television. Thought the packaging could have been more innovative, hence 4 instead of 5 stars.
B000063DFN|4.0|Powerslave is the fifth studio album by legendary british heavy metal band Iron Maiden, and for many this release is seen as the peak of their career musically. With all members now having a minimum of one album and one tour under the belt, the band is very tight sounding. In addition they are more aware of what they want their music to sound like when recording in the studio, and main songwriter Steve Harris still has the ability to conjure up tracks containing slightly surprising creative elements.    Musically Iron Maiden now has developed a distinct style of their own. Small remnants of their early punk roots still remain, the heritage from 70's hard rock can still be heard in places; especially on a track like \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\", but most times Iron Maiden now has a distinct, unique sound on this album.  Fast paced riffing combined with slower, atmospheric riffs, harmonic riffs and extensive use of harmonic, melodic soloing are all trademarks of Iron Maidens sound here, as well as drums and bass at times played faster than the guitars; and the bass guitar being a central instrument in the soundscape of most songs.  In addition to that, the song structures now begin showing influences from prog rock. The long epic \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" is the prime example of that, but also a track like \\"Losfer Words\\"; where the band plays around with repeating themes and slight touches of dissonance; is a good example of that influence.  The musical style is still heavy metal though; as the influence from progressive rock shows more in structure than in style.    The songs on \\"Powerslave\\" are mostly good. Title track \\"Powerslave\\" and the long epic \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" dominates the album, but most of the other tracks here are of high quality as well.    Overall this results in a classic heavy metal album; and is a worthwhile addition to most music collections.
0061142026|4.0|I bought this after seeing and loving the movie. I pored through it in about a day! While different from the movie in a lot of ways, I found the book to be just as good and interesting. This is a great read, and totally worth, buying and keeping.
B000063DI8|3.0|\\"No Prayer for the Dying\\" is the eighth studio release from classic British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, and their first release with guitarist Janick Gers. Upon it's release the album was given a lukewarm reception by many, mostly because new guitarist Gers replacing long-time guitarist Adrian Smith led to a distinct change in Iron Maidens sound. Their trademark melodic and harmonic solo guitarplaying was sorely missed by many.    Musically the album shows a band semingly in an identity crisis. There are quite a few examples of the band trying to continue with the musical direction they had on their previous release, \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\". Songs where the guitars are slick, toned down in the mix and generally coming across as a lighter form of heavy metal. In some songs they use synths as on their previous two albums, but in others they choose not to so.  But there are harder, grittier tracks on this album as well. Songs with darker textures, meaner vocals, with vocalist Dickinson snarling more than singing.  One major change from their last studio release; and what is a major change in the sound Iron Maiden developed throughout the 80's, is that few tracks here contain any structural progressive leanings. One of the main characteristics of Iron Maidens classic albums had been their development towards being a progressive metal band. This is mostly history on this release.  Another major change in the sound is a more subtle change; on many songs there's less riffing than what Iron Maiden usually has had; and in the songs where they use their traditional mix of fast riffing and drawn out guitar chords the pace of the riffing most times is noticeable slower.  Adding those elements to the fact that the harmony soloing now is mostly history; and a greater influx of traditional metal soloing in the songs; and you have an album with a dramatic change in overall sound.    Many feel that this album shows a band going back to their roots; that this album is closerto the punk-influenced roots of Iron Maiden. Indeed, when recalling this album from memory only that was what I remembered about this release as well.  After listening through this album I'll have to admit a faulty memory in that respect. Although many of the songs are more primitive than on previous releases, they are not any closer to Iron Maiden's musical roots. The songs are less complex and more straight-forward only. Indeed, the addition of Gers has led to some songs getting a slight bluesy flavouring rather than punk-influenced; and the overall musical style here is closer to traditional heavy metal than NWoBHM.    As for the songs on this release; my main impression is that the band struggled hard to put an album together. Opening track \\"Tail Gunner\\" and \\"The Assassin\\" are the best songs here in my opinion; the first being a classic opening track in true Iron Maiden style, and the second one showing a band experimenting succesfully with their sound.  \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\" and \\"Mother Russia\\" gives me the impression of being scrapped ideas for the typical long, epic Iron Maiden tracks they used to have on previous albums, where the band has tried to put together the best pieces of songs previously abandoned.  The rest of the tracks are for the most part not convincing; and my overall impression is that the creative well of the songwriters now has run dry; and that the songs selected for this album is a selection of outtakes and previously abandoned ideas.  There's nothing truly awful on this album; just too much that isn't good enough.
B0000042HV|3.0|The first ones are warm and human (as much so as anything written since the 19th century ever gets except Rachmaninov or Sibelius).  But as they progress, they become more dissonant and strident and unpleasant.  Well-performed.  I suppose all editions of them are.  I doubt I'll listen to them much.  But I'll haul them out occasionally and listen until I can't take it any more.  The price was right.  A bargain.
B000063DI9|3.0|By 1988 british heavy metal band Iron Maiden had firmly established themselves as one of the major bands, perhaps even THE major band, in the heavy metal scene. Their seventh studio release; \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" is the last of what most would say are the classic Iron Maiden albums. It is a release loved by many and hated by some, and showed a band moving on from heavy metal to something else. A move that would be abruptly stopped after this release, sadly.    Musically Iron Maiden continues the transition they started with \\"Powerslave\\" and further explored on Somehwere in Time. The influences from progressive rock are if not stronger then at least easier recognizable on this release. The songs are more complex; with changes in style and tempo more radical than on past releases; the synth is more extensivly used on this release; and is a vital aspect of the soundscapes in many songs here.  In addition, the guitars are toned down making the music as such less \\"heavy\\" than before, and the individual instruments are used to create nuances and subtle moods quite a lot on this album.    The overall sound of most songs on this release are still heavy metal though, Maiden's by now typical fast paced drums, fast paced bass, pacey riffing varied with drawn out riffs, and the melodic and harmonic soloing are still very much present; but they are now used with in a slightly changed musical context; where progressive rock now seems to be the main influence.    But as with their previous release \\"Somewhere in Time\\" this evolved sound can only do so much with songs that aren't top notch. Although lyrically fitting within the concept story on this album; there are quite a few songs on this release that really doesn't manage to inspire. And even on the better songs, there are parts that deducts rather than adds to the overall quality of the song.    Still, there are quite a few good tracks on this release; tracks that are on par with the best Maiden wrote a few years earlier. On a varied release, my personal highlight is the title track; which in itself is almost a good enough reason to buy this release.
B000E0LB7C|5.0|If you are reading this review, chances are you are a classical record collector who owns multiple versions of all the Beethoven sonatas, perhaps multiple complete cycles by the likes of Schnabel, Kempff, Ashkenazy, et. al.  You are also probably wondering whether you should invest in another Beethoven cycle by a pianist whose name and legacy may be less familiar to you.  The answer is:  absolutely!  Not even Schnabel probed more deeply behind the notes than Wilhelm Backhaus, and few have possessed the technical endurance at an advanced age to conquer the rugged peaks of the late sonatas (all but the *Hammerklavier* were taken down when Backhaus was in his seventies).  Backhaus may be gruff sometimes; the earlier sonatas could do with more refinement, elegance and humor.  He also has a tendency to urge the music along at relatively swift tempos, which will not please those who prefer a leisurely ramble through Beethoven.  But whatever one's misgivings about a particular point of interpretation, the integrity, inwardness, and ruggedness of Backhaus's approach will win you over time and again.  Here is a pianist whose absolute mastery of technique and idiom affords him the space to follow his inner promptings without the slightest playing to the gallery.  The listener is invited to follow him along his way--or not; he aims mostly to challenge, and never merely to entertain.  The recordings sound newly minted in this affordable \\"bargain box.\\"  If you do not know Backhaus's interpretations, you are strongly encouraged to purchase this set.
0786838655|2.0|This book is a little elementary. Also, it seems like a lot of concepts were taken from Harry Potter. I think there is even a blatent reference to the Potter novels in the book. I like the concept and the use of Ancient Greek themes, but I think the market of people who can enjoy this book is rather small: 8-12 year olds with a comprehension of Ancient Greece.
B000005ALN|5.0|I got this CD when it came out in the mid 90s.  I thought is was OK.  Recently I had people over for brunch and put it on as background music, and towards the end someone commented on how great it was.  We all sat around and thought, you're right, this is really good.    It's not the upbeat pop you'd expect from GM, save for a few tracks.  In recent years he's remixed some of them, like Star People, into a better (and faster) version.  But for the most part, it's downtempo soul/pop with likable beats and good hooks.  Some of the songs verge on being too mass market pop, like Jesus to a Child.  BUt for the most part it's a pretty original, soulful album.  I listen to it all the time and it routinely gets positive (and surprised) feedback.  I'm not saying it's groundbreaking or a landmark in music production, but there is little to dislike about it if you want some mellow pop.  Think Radiohead, without the hip factor, and given a pop infusion for the tween set.

B000OPPSX0|5.0|This splendid three CD box set of Beethoven's complete Sonatas for Violin and Piano features perhaps the finest such duo of the mid-20th Century: Violinist Arthur Grumiaux and Pianist Clara Haskil. They are equally renowned for their Mozart performances and Grumiaux produced a splendid recording of the Bach solo Violin Sonatas and Partitas. Haskil's various Mozart recordings, especially of the Piano Concertos, are some of the finest, most lyrically eloquent ever made. Both musicians represent the summa of music's Germanic core at mid-century in its recorded state.<br /><br />These three CDs place Beethoven's Sonatas in chronological order, making it easier to follow the progression of his musical thought and the evolution of his style. What one discovers quickly, aided by such splendid playing, is how swiftly (certainly by the Opus 30 Sonatas, written in 1802) Beethoven relinquished Mozartean lyricism in favor of a motoric rhythmic drive and much shorter melodic lines. There is often an  expansion and contraction of the musical pulse (much like the intake and release of breath), frequently in the very same movement. This requires rhythmic flexibility, a subtly different, exquisitely free sense of time a la Furtwangler: a trait more common in the 40's and 50's than today's more rigid linearity. In other words, Beethoven had learned how to breath life into his music and Haskil and Grumiaux were positioned to express it effortlessly. That's what makes these recordings so good, so necessary for a serious Classical collection. Both performers are lyrical, capable of great beauty of tone, yet they are intellectual enough to convey the profound musical architecture of these pieces. You will enjoy these performances on several levels simultaneously: they are multi-dimensional performances as opposed to today's all-too-often 'single-note' musicality.<br /><br />These recordings were made in early stereo between September 1956 and September 1957. They are beautifully recorded, clear and full with somewhat narrow separation. Comparing these to Mutter/Orkis and Argerich/Kremer, there is a beauty of tone and a level of confident music making that stands just slightly above. Beethoven's Sonatas are great enough to merit several different interpretations. One of them should be this set. Most strongly recommended.<br /><br />Mike Birmanwith somewhat narrow separation.

0743454537|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Absolutely riveting. The story is told from each character's point of view. All well done for the most part, although occasionally Anna, the 13-year old, seemed on some level, way too old for her age, i.e. very eloquent at times which seemed a bit unbelievable to me.  But maybe Anna's maturity was the point the writer was trying to make. Hint: Don't look to the last chapter until you get there.

B000NDIAWY|5.0|Thanks to technology these days, there are few CD's I buy in the stores.  I'm either burning them from on line or getting them from Amazon.  Brandi's first release from this album, \\"The Story,\\" caught me by surprise one day in the car on a Sunday morning.  I thought it was being played by an alternative Christian station at one point.<br /><br />I immediately turned it up and fell in love with the lyrics....the lines on her face with a story to tell, but has no use when you have no one to tell it to.  I couldn't get those lyrics out of my head.<br /><br />I tucked it away in my mind to buy later, even added it to my Amazon Wish List. A trip to BestBuy to buy computer equipment several weeks later and I hear that song playing when I walk in.  I had to buy the album then and there no matter what the price.  I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />Immediately, Brandi's sound conjures up the heart of Janis Joplin, the soul of k.d. lang, the simple catchy memorable lyrics of Carol King.  Her sad bluesy folk sound lazily has me singing along and fading into a day dream, then she punches you hard in the face waking you up with her raspy loud anthem.  It's been a week, and I haven't taken her out of the player yet.<br /><br />Being a writer, I tend to listen to music that I think conveys one of my characters and how they would feel or act, maybe it's even music they'd listen to.  Let's just say by listening to Brandi, she's kept the pages flowing.<br /><br />Every song of hers is a sound and story I can relate to.
B000OYCN98|5.0|I was surprised to discover this sounds significantly better than the 2001 re master.  This live album has always had a muddy mix, but a quick comparison of the opening bass line in \\"Born to Go\\" leaves no doubt that the  individual instruments can be heard much more clearly in this new re master.  The extended mixes are also a welcome addition.  The DVD is very nice, I appreciate the visuals although it's a shame that there's no actual video of the show (is such a thing available?).  Just don't forget the DVD is in PAL format, not playable by most North American DVD players.  There are many cheap players on the market that will play PAL (most Philips do).
0743487486|5.0|Unconditional Parenting is probably the best and most provocative parenting book I've ever read. Be prepared to be challenged if you read this book.  The author does not believe in time-outs, punishments in general, or in giving rewards to children.  He basically believes we should be unconditional parents and treat our children like guests in our homes.  Yet, he isn't hands-off or loosy-goosey.  He doesn't believe in authoritative, traditional parenting or using control unnecessarily.  I read this book when my boys were 11 and 13 years old.  I wish I had read it when they were babies!  I would have done a lot of things differently with them had I read it earlier.  My husband agreed to watch the DVD (of the same name) with me and also agreed with a lot of what Kohn says.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|While Saw3 is certainly still more impressive than most horror sequals(not to mention original movies), there is an undeniable frustrating emptiness feel that even the die-hard fans would have to admit ths time round.    I won't go into plot details, because I do not believe they are the purpose of reviews...reviews should only give you an insight into the reflective feel one gets from watching a film.    Needless to say, If you have watched Saw and Saw2, I would advise to watch the third movie...but lower any hope you have of finding closure.    The series is literally being made up as it goes along, and the creators are completley losing the sense of how to tell a story and seem more eager to get internet discussion boards thriving on rumors and tales of what we didn't see.    This is what makes Saw3 the weakest installment, the creative hold is getting to strong and effecting the pace and style of the film.    Saw and Saw 2 were both entertaining and had a great sense of a filmaker who wanted to trick the audience..leave them muttering \\"I did not see that coming!\\" Then the director would pop out from behind the curtain and laugh with audience and elobarate on the film.    Saw 3 fails at this vitaly major draw that the series had, primarily because one gets the sense the Director is no longer behind the curtain,  because he is already scripting Saw4 and Saw5..and yes, Saw6.    This completely undermines what the film heavily relies upon..the suspnse has to work...and here it doesn't, the trick doesn't entertain, because the magican stops halfway through and moves onto another trick, then again and again.    I like films that make an audience wonder, but deliberate overuse of these  elements is just promoting the belief that without Saw being a secret..It's very little indeed.    The Script is so elaborate, so logically challenged, that the only way to distract the audience is by these \\"What happened there?\\" Questions that are riddled throughout.    Picture you arewatching an entertaining thriller, and the person next to you keeps asking you to divide and multilpy numbers at the same time.    That's the unavoidable feeling one gets with Saw3.    If the creators weren't money greedy fools, perhaps we could have had an outstanding trilogy that begins and ends..instead, this is already becoming an endless remix of a song that doesn't end,  \\"yes it goes on and on my friend\\".
B0000DG00B|5.0|Had heard portions of a far lower quality version many years ago (and even that sounded pretty intense). This release is the BEST of the early ABB live recordings...and yes I've heard Ludlow Garage (much overated).    I particularly enjoyed the 5th's set, but both are great examples of  ABB completely at home in their element. You can't help but rock out to the entire recording - play it loud on a good system and invite some friends over for a cold one.    The sound quality is excellent and the recording captures the band in their absolute hard-driving best. If you consider yourself a lovero of American blues, rock and roll or just plain good music this is a must-have recording. A collection of ABB is certainly incomplete without it.
B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|First this is a pretty good movie, especially if you like action movies with a fare amount of gore. My low review of this film comes not from the quality of the movie but rather from the poor quality of the encoding and transfer to Blu-ray. This is NOT how blue ray is supposed to look. The clarity is very poor and barely above DVD quality. Unfortunately many Blue-ray and HD-DVD movies are like this and I am getting very tired of paying $10-20 bucks more for a movie that is only marginally better visually. I encourage you to save your money and buy the DVD version.
B000UR366S|1.0|It is sad when someone who has been in the music business for a long time and has the money to pay for live instrumentalists decides not to go that direction.  Many people will listen to this album and consider it \\"deep\\" and \\"colorful\\" and \\"mature\\", but all the work behind it is almost for nothing because of the use of synthesized instruments.  That is like using a computer-generated voice to replace the singer!  NOT OKAY.  Not only are synthesized instruments devoid of necessary emotion and rich sound quality (resulting in lower-quality music), but their use by a musician is disrespectful to their instrumentalist peers.  I would rather hear a mediocre high school flute player on someone's album than a computer-generated one.  If Joni wants to *truly* make mature music, she should seriously pursue classical training for a few years.  Classical and jazz music seem to be the only genres left that haven't been corrupted by technology, greed, and ignorance, and studying either INTENSIVELY would do a great service to Joni's music.

B000002L99|5.0|\\"Well, helloooooooooooooooo, baby!\\"  Thus begins one of the most successful 1980s albums ever, and what an album it is.  So began my own personal journey into Van Halen's studio catalogue.  My first Van Halen album was Best of Vol 1, and my first studio album that followed was this puppy, 5150.  So let's get down to the album itself.    When Van Halen released 5150 in 1986, its fan base waited with baited breath due to the band having a new singer, Sammy Hagar.  While the Hagar/Roth debate has been [going back and forth from that day to this] raging ever since,  the public made it quite clear that overall, a significant portion of Van Halen's fans were big fans of the direction the band was going in, making 5150 the band's first number one album in its career.    When Van Halen jettisoned lead singer David Lee Roth in 1985 (or he left to pursue a solo career, depending on whose story you're listening too), they were left in quite a predicament.  Not only did Roth leave, he took most of the band's management and their only producer up to that point, Ted Templeton, with him, to do his own albm, \\"Eat `Em and Smile\\".  On that album, Roth would strip away the keyboards Eddie so adamantly added to the band's sound and returned to his earlier sound.  So would Van Halen call it quits?  They were all set for life, and had a very successful run of six multiplatnum albums.  Or would they look for a new singer?    Well, we all know the answer to that.  They began auditioning for new singers, and at one time entertained the idea of having different temp singers front the band for an album to see who the public liked (think Rock Star:INXS twenty years before they did a TV show about it).  Naturally, this idea didn't pan out, as [Eddie discovered Sammy Hagar at a mechanic shop as he was getting his lamborgini serviced, and they hit it off.] Eddie discovered Sammy Hagar, lead singer to Monstrose from the 1970s and several successful solo discs on his own.  Sammy says the first timehe ever met Eddie (at nine in the morning) Eddie was smashed out of his mind on alcohol.  The band got together with Sammy, and soon wrote several new songs.    Naturally, the new singer brought a totally new sound to Van Halen.  Where the Van Roth band focused more on the rock and roll element and party hearty image, Van Hagar's focused were more on ballads and love songs, with a healthy measure of rock in there as well.  Still, 5150 has a much different feel to it than the previous six Roth LPs as far as the front man's personality, personae, and image were concerned.  It is quite clear from the get go that Eddie wanted to move the band into new directions, and he largely did that with Hagar.    The ironic thing,  in all this, naturally, is, out of the four Van Hagar albums and the six Van Roth albums, 1984, their last record with Roth, and 5150, their first record with Hagar, are the mostly closely related between the two different eras [of all their albums].  While obviously Hagar is no Roth (but by the same token Roth's no Hagar either), the actual songwriting on 5150 has its foundations and roots in 1984.  After the fiasco of DIVER DOWN, Eddie wanted control over the band's musical future and ultimately founded his own studio 5150, which this record's name is drawn from.  It is in 1984 Eddie began to implement, and vary successfully at that, keyboards into the band's sound, and broaden out the band's overall musical approach more into a pop-metal sound than a pop-rock and roll sound.  1984 set up a whole new playing field for the band, with a much more mainstream, pop-metal sheen than the first four Van Halen albums and even DIVER DOWN, which is little more than a deliberate attempt to cash in.    5150 is a natural extension of the band's new sound that was largely established largely in 1984.  Several of Van Hagar's best songs are right here on the first disc.    \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\" and \\"Dreams\\" were huge hits, and deservedly so.  Both are among Van Hagar's best material, and \\"Dreams\\" is not only one of the band's best power ballads, but also one of the best ballads of the 1980s.  \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" is one of Van Halen's most highly regarded songs.  Great rock and roll, even given the fact they say you don't need to get born again to go to heaven (rather troubling line for the religiously inclined).    \\"Summer Nights\\" is one of those songs no person growing up in a small town and hanging out in parking lots at night can't help but look at fondly.  That song always brings back a lot of memories for me, and I can relate to it very well.    \\"Get Up\\" is a great \\"get off your ass and make your life work\\" song.  \\"Good Enough,\\" the opening song to the disc with its very memorably opening line (probably VH's most memorable intro), is a adrenaline pumping, hard-rock celebration of sexual attraction at its most physical and basest of all levels.  In other words - pure lust all the way baby.    \\"5150\\", Van Halen's second title cut to one of their albums, is actually one of the more minor songs on the record as far as popularity goes.  Still, a good song.  \\"Inside\\" is easily the strangest song on the album, and indeed one of the strangest in their entire catalogue.  One of my favs, though I can see why people wouldn't like it.    That leaves us with one song left.  \\"Love Walks In\\".  A lyrical tour-de-force, this is easily the best song Van Halen ever wrote, at least lyrically.  Sammy Hagar states it's about when aliens came down and visited him (no, I'm not making this up - he talked about it on Howard Stern and in a Guitar World interview).  While the song definitely makes a lot of sense from the standpoint of a person remembering an alien encounter (and this is before Whitely Strieber's \\"Communion\\" came out), the beauty of this song is it doesn't have to be about aliens, but can have any number of meaning.  For me, this is probably my favorite Van Halen song.    While both EAT `EM AND SMILE and 5150 are great competing albums, I have to give the edge to 5150.  It's the tightest, single best album of the four that the band made with Hagar.    The genius of David Lee Roth as the prototypical rock and roll front man is his larger-than-life personae, his gonzo rock antics, and his wild, crazy partycentric lifestyle.  Much of the appeal of Van Halen was this larger-than-life frontman.    When Hagar replaced Roth, there was, naturally, no way for him to replace Roth as the front man without an image modification for the band.  While Roth was almost a caritcature of himself, a party-hearty animal, Sammy Hagar brought a much more down to earth approach to the whole rock front-man scene.  He was the meat and potatoes front man while Roth was the caviar on a yacht out in the Carribean front man.  Each have their strengths.    \\"It's been a long, long time, but back in about '68, in Fontana, California, I had this unbelievable experience that would take this whole interview to even go into,\\" Hagar told Guitar World magazine recently. \\"But I'm a firm believer -- have seen, have felt, have been contacted three or four different times. I have received information that has been valuable in my life from those people, and they have used me. I'm gonna sound like a complete nut here, but they have used me in an experimental fashion. The easiest way to put it is that they downloaded my brain information. When I was about 19 or 20, they downloaded everything that was in my head. And I caught 'em doin' it! I woke up in the middle of the night, thinkin', 'What's goin' on?' They were like, 'Oh, my god, he's waking up!' But this was all telepathy -- there were no words being spoken. And as soon as I woke up -- it was probably three o'clock in the morning -- my whole room was so bright that I could hardly keep my eyes open. I was wide-awake, I could not move, eyes open, white room, they were still disconnecting -- and when they did, it just went bang! Everything went back to normal, back to black. I was shaking, I almost passed out, I was sick to my stomach and almost had to throw up, it was so scary...    [...]
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Great Audio, excellent video, and amazing extra-features, packaging and menues.<br /><br />The music is very intimate, an excellent representation of On An Island.<br /><br />100% recomended.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|IMO this is a natural progression from where the left off on II. The guitars are really working together to create a diverse sound with the harmonys. They also stepped up and got a better drum sound on this album ala John Bonhamish.. Phil is on point and isn't screaming through everything.. Great hooks and fist pumping riffs. Awesome cd!
B000UGG39Q|3.0|Je vien de me procurer le nouvel album de down (belle pochette !!) et voici ma critique :<br /><br />Avant, quand on &eacute;coutait le 1er album, on pouvait immediatement voir l`influance coc, crowbar et pantera.Pour cette album mme et messieurs, c`est fini !! Il ny a plus de gros riff a la crowbar, il na a plus de force a la pantera (Phil ne crit pas une fois sur cette album, le 1er de tout ca carriere qui a entierement fait ajeun....) et pire encore il na aucune trace de Black Sabath ou meme Led Zepplin !! Pour les fans du 1er, vous allez etre decus.C`est completement un nouveaux band, c`est completement un nouveaux son, c`est completement une nouvelle ambiance.Je ne suis pas sur si je l`aime encore (seulement une ecoute) je suis sur que jai tres tres hate au show par contre.<br /><br />Ps: jai vue un entrevue sur le net avec Kirk, il a pas arreter de boir ...... mais il sest inscrit au gym et il dit vouloir perdre du poid, c`est exactement comme ca que l`album sonne........ Mois gras.<br /><br />Borman
032147404X|5.0|I bought this for my wife who wants to learn to use something other then an instantmatic type camera. I had bought her a Z6 and she didn't know where to begin with all of these functions, but didn't want to be shown by me or anyone else how to use it.     The book has helped a lot, now she looks up how to do something and feels she has learned a lot about taking pictures. A lot of practical information without dwelling on theory.
0761145613|5.0|Such a simple idea and invaluable.  I didn't know how much I needed this until I bought it.  My husband travels so much, I work and we have 2 kids and 2 dogs... we all have busy schedules... NOW we know what everyone one is doing..<br /><br />Fantastic!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This film is the first in a series of animated films by Walt Disney studios.  At the time it was groundbreaking in that no feature length fully animated sound cartoon had been made at that point.  Its framework, a strong but simple plot mixed with songs, humour and adventure was kept intact for many decades. The animation is fantastic for its time.  Snow White in some ways can be seen as an extended Silly Symphony, those series of Disney cartoon shorts that allowed Walt to experiment with realistic animation, technological breakthroughs and character development.  Snow White blew people away when it was first shown.  Remember, we're talking about the mid/late 30's.  Porky pig was a new character for Warner Bros.  Woody Woodpecker and Bugs Bunny were yet to be.  Krazy Kat and Farmer Alfalfa were \\"entertaining\\" fans of Columbia and Terrytoons.  Once Snow White came to town, followed closely by Pinnochio, all the studios were forced to improve the quality of their cartoons simply because the public expected more.  If it wasn't for Walt Disney taking the financial risks to take animation to its highest level one wonders if cartoons would even have made it to the 21st Century.  Chuck Jones's early films were Disneyesque until he found a new direction.  Tex Avery took perverse joy at MGM by sending up Disney cartoons, but he did it with great animation and lavish technicolor.  In short, Snow White is the true beginning of the Animation Golden Age.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this because I'm going to see the Broadway Production in October.  I've been listening to it while I run errands and it has made me look forward to seeing it in person even more.  The music is catchy and the quality of the recording is good.  Well worth it.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|[[ASIN:B0000AUHPB The Italian Job]]  Let's face it, this movie and this version of it with Michael Caine and Noel Coward is a must for all MINI Cooper owners.  It fulfills all the fantasies we enjoy about our grand little cars.  The movie is a great romp and never pauses with its cast of wonderful unbelievable characters.  Great fun from start to finish.      The quality of the DVD itself is excellent.  Color, sound and visual detail are outstanding
B00004RGUI|4.0|this CD is lovely, it is perfect background music to relax to, or to listen to when you are having guests. I enjoyed it much.
1594200823|4.0|This book is very enlightening and informative. Over the last several months I have been reading lots of books about health and nutrition. This book stands apart from other, not for the quantity of scientific data that it presents, but for the unique perspective it offers to readers. I've always wondered where the myriad ingredients on industrial foods comes from. This book gives you a glimpse of their origins and evolution. This is one of the only books I've ever read that makes you aware that eating can be a moral and political act. It certainly changes the way I think about food. I would have to say that I am much better informed about the consequences of my eating decisions because of this book. Anyone with an inquisitive mind should find some or all of this book to be very valuable.
075640407X|5.0|I could tell you about how the women aren't beautiful magicians/archers while the men are prophecied to find fabled swords to fight an evil king, but I am not very good at talking about that stuff. Or how funny the book is, or how much it pulls at the heartstrings.    All I can really say is that sitting down to read this book is like eating a very good meal and being satisfied that there is more to come. It is a long book, but not a word is wasted on too-pithy remarks or needless action.    In a way it's a story about storytelling. There's the stories and songs that Kvothe learns as a child, the story written by The Chronicler (and you don't get a name like that unless chronicling is important), or the ones Kvothe looks for in books or in taverns. This is the kind of worldbuilding I am into. It is the kind that makes you believe you are holding in your hands the truth behind all stories after they've all been covered up by myth and legend.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I saw the film on the 25th of August in Edinburgh (at the Film Festival)and it was surely the best one I saw!!So when I came back home in Athens, Greece, I ordered the CD from Amazon.It's one of the greatest soundtracks I have listened to in a long time and I strongly recommend it to everybody!!Don't miss the film and you should definitely listen to the CD!!I'm sure you'll fall for it!!
B000RW3YYA|3.0|Despite the 3-star rating, for me `Stargate: Atlantis' remains slick and absorbing television and it's still one of my favourite shows. But so often with season three there's a great deal of promise, only for little to be delivered in terms of engrossing stories with a moral core, or with convincing character development. I also find it disconcerting how the Wraith are being developed into a race devoid of any redeemable qualities and how despite their sentience they're treated as little more than base life forms, even when they take human form and gain the potential to do good, as evidenced in episode 2- `Misbegotten' (7/10).    Sadly, I also think the show is beginning to suffer from a lack of well-rounded, sympathetic characters- Rodney is central to a huge number of episodes in this season compared to his fellow cast members, episodes that see him learning valuable lessons, only to revert back to his usual rude, sarcastic, abusive self in the next episode, apparently having learned nothing from the experiences. Ronan proves himself once and for all to be completely one-dimensional in the fourth episode- `Sateda' (4/10)- he's violent, threatening, reckless, disobedient and has no other sides to his personality.    Episode 5- `Progeny' (10/10) is totally absorbing, tense and surprising, combining the best themes that the original Stargate and Stargate: Atlantis have to offer.    Episode 7- `Common Ground' (6/10) is the latest attempt to resurrect the way-past-its-peak/flogging-a-dead-horse Genii story-arc. The story has strong shades of an episode series co-creator and executive producer Brad Wright wrote for the Outer Limits a few years ago called `Quality of Mercy' exploring how captivity can mess with your sense of reality and alter your preconceptions, but the story is just too thin here. The Genii were once an interesting race and really convincing foes despite their technological inferiority, but since Colm Meaney was supplanted as their leader it's a storyline that's clearly become directionless. On the positive side, the Wraith prisoner in this episode is dealt with fairly and with some sympathy, which makes a welcome change.    Episode 12- `The Return, Part I' (9/10) is incredibly promising, as an Ancient transport is accidentally discovered travelling through space. Its crew members are subsequently brought back to Atlantis where the Ancient female leader takes abrupt and surprising action. But as the story resumes in `The Return, Part II' (6/10) it suddenly becomes another story entirely, the female Ancient representative vanishes into thin air and with the exception of Jack O'Neill swimming through a flooded area of the city the episode doesn't come close to realising its potential.    In episode 15- `The Game' (7/10) Sheppard and McKay begin playing what they assume is an Ancient form of recreation, but which turns out to be absolutely real to the inhabitants of a distant planet. It's a fun idea, but the way the premise is constructed is just too implausible and the story is filled with so many coincidences that for me it just lost all credibility. It also has some really poor characterisation- Dr. Weir supposedly spent years as a talented delegate back on Earth, it was in fact one of the reasons she was awarded the leadership of the Atlantis expedition, but in this episode she can't even succeed in keeping two representatives from opposing sides at the conference table for a minute and a half (and they aren't even that uncompromising). This could have been Weir's chance to shine and for her character to finally be recognised as the talented, respected, useful member of the team we know she can be, but instead we have 44 minutes of Sheppard and McKay bickering like 5-year-olds.    Then comes episode 17- `Sunday' (7/10) which is downright baffling. It starts off as a gentle sidestep into the personal lives of the expedition members and suddenly, right out of the blue the Atlantis team suffers a surprising loss inthe form of one of their closest colleagues. All I can say is...prepare yourself for the end of an era.    The penultimate episode `Vengeance' (6/10) sees the return of part Human, part Wraith Michael in a much repeated story in the Stargate franchise. Is it just me, or is this the opposite direction most viewers would have preferred this character taking? There's no ethical conflict, or even any conscience left in the character at all, he's completely transformed into the clichéd villain and is now lumped in with the many other enemies the Atlantis expedition has managed to accumulate since arriving in the city.    The season final episode- `First Strike' (8/10) rightly continues on from the best episode of season three `Progeny' and also sets the all-action, guns blazing, no compromises, no retreats tone that has made the season finales of the previous two years so entertaining. Unfortunately, I think the story layout for the finale's has now become too familiar i.e. the stakes are set high for Atlantis, the mission doesn't go as planned, the consequences could be disastrous for all and then comes the obligatory cliff-hanger ending. Earth's military again involve themselves in the affaires of the city, but this time the implications are very ominous for the civilian contingent of the expedition, suggesting a movement towards an even more militaristic regime in future seasons, which I personally don't agree with, but I guess I'll have to reserve judgment until season four...
B000TGCR38|5.0|Just when we think we have read about or seen all of the stories there are to tell about courageous heroes/heroines who sacrificed much for the sake of many during World War II, along comes BLACK BOOK (ZWARTBOEK) with another dramatic 'biography' of a significant figure.  Director Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Spetters, Total Recall) is a much admired Dutch artist who is able to draw his audience into another world so real that it literally feels as though we are part of the process. And that is precisely why this film works so well: the audience as a participant drives home the film's message that war changes people, that from one day to the next it is impossible to distinguish the 'bad' from the 'good', the 'enemy' from the 'friend'.<br /><br />Rachel Stein (the enormously gifted Carice van Houten) was a Jewish Dutch born cabaret singer in Berlin until the war broke out, at which time she returned to Holland to hide during the Jewish Solution.  A series of incidents in 1944 destroy her hiding place and thwart her attempts to join her family to escape the Nazis.  She is left to fend by herself until she bonds with a group from the Dutch Resistance.  Gaining their confidence she is asked to masquerade as a German singer, dye all of her body hair blond, enter Germany as the consort of a doctor Hans Akkerman (Thom Hoffman) and infiltrate the highest elements of the Nazi regime, namely to become the mistress of Gestapo head Ludwig M&uuml;ntze (Sebastian Koch) changing her name to Ellis de Vries. She stays in contact with the Resistance, places microphones in strategic positions, and with her friend Ronnie (Halina Reijn) becomes a Nazi party girl, singing at events while assisting her colleagues underground.  The story is complex with many surprises as to who is with the Nazis and who is with the Resistance, and the story is so well told that we the audience are left guessing identities much the same as the characters.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven wrote the screenplay with Gerard Soeteman and Verhoeven's dedication to his story is always present.  There is a considerable violence and some sections that may offend viewers, but try to tell a true war story without including such aspects!<br /><br />The cast is brilliant, especially the multi-talented Carice van Houten, easily one of the finest actresses on the screen today. The entire cast is includes such gifted actors as Waldemar Kobus, Derek de Lint, Christian Berkel, Dolf de Vries, Michiel Huisman and Ronald Armbrust.  The cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub recreates not only The Hague, Holland, and Germany but also a kibbutz in Israel with solid veracity. Anne Dudley has created a musical score that includes songs from the period (sung beautifully by Carice van Houten), and atmospheric scoring for the tender scenes as well as the many tense scenes.<br /><br />Released in Europe in 2006, it is not clear as to whether this film will be eligible for the Oscars this year.  If it is it should win.  It is one of the finest films this reviewer has seen in a long time. In Dutch, German, Hebrew, and English with subtitles.  Highly Recommended!

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I don't watch TV.  Ever.  Partly because I just can't stand commercials.  But mostly because there's not enough like Dexter out there... and Dexter is \\"out there\\" for sure.  Dexter takes the \\"police procedural\\" through the looking glass, into a world that's totally familiar but somehow backwards - warped and distorted, but still easily recognizable.    The title character Dexter is almost a film noir style anti-hero; his internal monologue is at times brilliant, and at it's worst it's still entertaining.  Shocking, irreverent, insightful, darkly funny... I'm sure people have said all these things about Dexter.    Towards the end of Season 1, the plot becomes more than a little bit ham-fisted in my opinion - I think that's a bit disappointing, considering how brilliantly everything else is done - but I forgive that.  I'm not here for the story (although the story did manage to suck me in, and leave me wanting to see more) -- I'm loving this just for the sheer fun of Dexter being Dexter.  The rest is just an excuse to make more episodes, which I'll eagerly await.    If you've ever fantasized about the upside of being a sociopath, this is definitely the show for you.  (And don't miss the episode where Dexter goes to a shrink!)  And if not, that's OK - just surf on over to the Disney stuff, and wrap yourself in a happier world.  We won't miss you.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|If you have never seen the late FOX show Firefly, then this is a movie that can be quickly described as a space western.  The movie is excellent, well worth getting.  The new edition has new commentary and some additional special features that a hardcore fan will appreciate.  Pretty cool really.
1416523359|3.0|I read Lisey's Story while stuck in my hotel in Cabo during a hurricane (Henriette, for those interested).  The book has plenty of character development however the rewards never come.  It is a rambling narrative, aiming to place the reader right next to Lisey and her incessant babbling about inside jokes, metaphors and life experiences both with and without her dead husband.  There were some moments of interest (Amanda's revelations, Jim Dooley, Scott's relationship with his family) but not enough to make this 600 page read worthwhile.  Not to mention it's a  tough read at that, the dialogue is detailed and confusing.
B000RJO578|4.0|This is basically Shaun of the Dead for cop movies.  It nails all the tropes and pokes fun at them without ever being mean.  At the same time it is a good movie.
B000QXDED6|5.0|In *300*, Dilios narrates the life of Leonidas, king of Sparta, especially bringing our attention to the battle at Thermophylae.  Immediately after birth, Spartan males are inspected for flaws.  If flawed, they are tossed out and killed.  If normal, they are trained at a young age as a warrior.  There's no greater honor than to die for Sparta.<br /><br />When Leonidas becomes king, there's a threat looming Sparta.  Xerxes, the god-king, of Persia declares that all must bow before him or face consequences.  Sparta does not escape Xerxes' eyes.  Bound by tradition, Leonidas heads up high to a rocky mountain to consult with a monestary and the Oracle to get her blessing.  The Oracle warns that they should not go to war to honor an upcoming sacred festival.<br /><br />Ignorning the Oracle's warning, Leonidas rounds up 300 Spartan men and leads them to Thermophylae to battle Xerxes and his men.  Meanwhile, the Spartan Queen has discovered that there's a traitor in Leonidas' army.  She pleads to the Senate to send additional armies to stop this traitor.<br /><br />What can I say?  Beautiful cinematic styles and shots.  The costumes and the fight scenes were mesmerizing.  The arrival of Xerxes as the god-king was just mind-blowing.  The wall of corpses was just creepy.<br /><br />The movie itself can be a bit long for some viewers.  However, if you enjoy history (although some reviewers have stated that there are some errors), war and dialogues in ancient times, then you'll enjoy this.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Only one word:  excellent.  One of the best foreign movies I´ve ever seen.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I read \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" and enjoyed it well enough. This series is very rare in that it transcends the original material by leaps and bounds. Michael C. Hall amazed me - I was so used to him in Six Feet Under I almost didn't recognize him as Dexter. This DVD set is going in my wish list - I'll be more than happy to watch it again.
B00003CXBH|5.0|My wife and I saw \\"The Mission\\" when it came out in 1986.  We have considered it one of the finest of movies.  After going back to our second home in Brazil, we finally visited Iguaçu Falls in this, our 50th year of marriage.  By now, we have studied more of the history of the Jesuits, there and in our Southwest.  We have recently met several descendants of the Guarani, and read José Alencar's classic, \\"O Guaraní\\".  Visiting Iguaçu Falls moves everyone, of all ages.    Seeing the movie again made it doubly or triply as profound.  The music starts the tears of joy and appreciation; they continue throughout the film.  The prolonged, scene-by-scene commentary by the director enrich the movie even more.  The film presents a troubling, true story surrounded by some of the most beautiful scenery in this world.  Where God had given us so much majesty, why did man have to stoop so low? How did the Guaraní manage to live so uprightly?  Critics of actors must like to pick, pick, pick.  This film transcends the actors and directors and pickiness.
1401300529|5.0|I knew David when we both were young. It was an odd assortment of intellectuals which included Gay Talese, A.E. Hotcher, Peter Maas. He was on his way to fame in VietNam and we met in a beach house in Ocean City, NJ. He was larger than life, even then. I was on the fringe, of course, a school teacher, who admired the joi de vivre of these young men.I pursued my career, they theirs. But, I followed David's, reading every word he wrote.....and they were memorable. I have read only the intro to this book, but it is Halberstam at his finest.....incisive, articulate, comprehensive. That it is published, posthumously, is tragic. The voice stilled will live on in \\"The Coldest Winter\\". And, for those of us who remember Korea, this is the epic/explanation for which we have been waiting.
1594489505|5.0|The Kite-Runner was so emotional that I had to put it down several times. Of course, returned to it until the positive finale. This book, by the same author, went on my priority list. It is very special, giving insight in the same way that The Kite-Runner did, a glimpse into a culture, a people, and, particulary, a woman's plight/role in a foreign land. \\"Foreign\\", yes, to most Americans, but resonating w/ women everywhere. Does it have a happy ending? You will have to decide for yourself. Is it worth reading? Ah, not to be missed!
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|The number of bonus features on this new edition of the movie make it work upgrading if you already have the movie and like it. Most upgrade DVDS have a few things on them but are mostly just a way for the companies to milk fans for money. That's not the case here. This was well worth the money spent buying the same movie a second time. If you own the passion of the Christ and are considering whether or not to upgrade I would saw yes.
0385334206|3.0|I'm definitely a Vonnegut fan, and despite my lack-luster review of this book, it was not enough to detour me from reading more of him. However, this one just didn't hold my interest in the same manner as his others. Yes, Vonnegut delivers satirical social commentary, but for me, it was at a much slower, more disguised pace than his norm. I was not compelled to read the book in one fell swoop as I normally am with a Vonnegut book.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|I have quite a collection of DVD movies and when people ask me which one of all do I like best, it always comes down to \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\"! The plot is great and believable, the cast is excellent, and the effects are out of this world! This movie got me sitting at the edge of my seat from the start to the end. There are movies that I own which I haven't seen yet, but this one, I've watched 3 times and would not hesitate to watch it again and again.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|For all of us that grew up with the original Star Trek, this is a wonderful creation.  It breathes new life into an already great classic icon.  On the opposite side of the coin, it saddens me that profit motive in this case has gone well beyond avarice and greed.  If Paramount wishes to remain in good graces with consumers, they need to rethink their marketing approach.  Shame on you Paramount.  I expected more!!!!!
B000P0I4O4|4.0|John Cusack and Morgan Freeman gives great entertainment in this drama/thriller. I like the twist this movie takes when a rude killer (Freeman) shows sympathy and create a bond with a father (Cusack) and his son (new actor Jamie Anderson). Unrealistic maybe, but somewhat believable after everything they go through all through the movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, it has great special effects and the scenery is outstanding!
B000RZIGVS|3.0|Like many others I have collected every season of every Star Trek series on DVD.  At the moment I don't see a point to purchasing this collection.  Also, they really should get these shows into widescreen.  I've been told the series was mostly recorded on VHS but I'm sure they could work something out.  For now I'll hold off and wait for the HD-DVD's coming soon.
B000NA1OXY|2.0|Well, I bought the clean version knowing that the songs I'd heard from it contained more crud than most of her CD's, but just because you can't hear her say the word, you know exactly what they cut out. There is less of the deep, reflective side that we can all relate to so well, and more of the man-hater side that only comes out when someone really does something dumb. So, if you just broke up with a jerk, this is the CD for you!
B00005JKG9|5.0|Glengarry Glen Ross is a perfectly delivered movie masterpiece. It brings home the message and the definition of the super salesman and is a film that is totally carried by dialog. No special effects, sounds and explosions are found in this movie. Although a bit extreme in its depiction of a sales oriented firm's sales force, the movie is quite accurate in its message that the people who really bring in the money in any organization are essentially gods and the rest of the people have to kind live with whatever situation they are in.    The dialog, delivery and performance of almost everyone including Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Al Pacino are exemplary. This is easily among my top 20 movie list of all time.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Better than \\"It's Time\\", not quite as good as his first, I loved this CD and find myself singing along to the songs with more enthusiasm than the people in the cars next to me understand.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I caught this movie on cable while channel surfing - I am not even a fan of scary movies, but the second I had my eyes on it I just couldn't look away. It grabs your attention like that =] Several weeks later with no sleep, I watched it again at my in-laws home (bc I missed about 20 mins of the beginning the first time I saw it) - loved it again, even more! And to my total surprise I ended up buying the dvd. I dislike watching movies I've already seen again, but RE is the exception to the rule. I have lost count of how many times I've watched it and it's always great entertainment. Milla is gorgeous, the soundtrack is awesome, the story is perfect... I just love this movie =]  The second and third movies are awesome movies also. Hopefully there will be a fourth... fifth... sixth... and so on =]
B000Q6GUT8|1.0|This movie hits all the anti American talking points.  Iraq is a war for oil.  Donald Rumsfeld is a lier.  America rapes robs and murders across the world to achieve its selfist goals. Our soilders are being duped by American polititions for their greedy personal benifits. What happened at Abu Ghraib is equal to murdering innocent men, women and children.  The jihadist give it two thumbs up.  This movie will be used across the world as a reason to kill Americans.  (most of its gross is from foreign markets)  Not to mention that every turn is completly predictable.

Once you've used Javascript to solve some basic needs this reference will become a great tool.
B000UR9TQE|5.0|Having not bought this item I thought it was great. You may not have heard of Led Zeppelin because they are an obscure rock band from the 70's that now with the re-release of this re-release have released a new set of remixed re-releases that might, for the impoverished group, gain them some of the reputation they justly deserve. These tracks are remastered and remixed from the original remasters and remixed again to give a re-re-mastered quality remix, the likes of which you have never heard before. The packaging, which I haven't seen, is also well designed.

And coincidently, her classic Rio de Janeiro Blues is on both.  The 2007 version is better.  Thank you Randy for keeping the great music flowing. Buy this today.
B00005JMEW|2.0|Why did I get the distinct impression I was watching a very poor parody of \\"The Abominable Dr. Phibes\\", starring Vincent Price.<br />A slight bit of humour (mixed in between profanities); and throw in a Bruce Lee film, and you have: KILL BILL, VOLUME 1.<br /><br />A very bad movie.  The anime segments done properly had the potential for a bit of creativity.  The only problem was: I kept thinking how much money Tarantino saved by not having to film these sequences with actors and actresses,--live action style.<br /><br />All in all, a very forgettable movie.  I feel no need to see volume 2.<br /><br />Braithwaite
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This is definitely a keeper. Not only do you get the movie, the commentary by Joss Whedon, the commentary with Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau and Ron Glass, all the cool behind-the-scenes wonders from the first edition, BUT you get shiny new key art, some random improvs, the R.

0345350499|5.0|If you are a Witch, pagan, magician, feminist, or just a plain tree-hugging dirt worshipper, this is the book for you!<br /><br />Marion Zimmer Bradley (MZB)was a practicing Witch and Priestess, and she knew the Goddess. This amazing retelling of the Arthurian legends shows that women and the Goddess played just as much a role in the course of events as Merlin did. \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" gives hope and a tale of inspirational wonder to any who know the Goddess.<br /><br />MZB's life as a Witch and Priestess also gave her the incredible talent of putting the use of magick, and the workings of psychic energy onto pen and paper. Although there are many books out there today on Witchcraft and magick, this book offers a special glimpse into the potential ancient mysteries.<br /><br />This book is for all those who knew in their hearts that Morgan Le Fey was never an evil sorceress.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|I'm not content to review Inland Empire yet because i believe it will take several viewings to get to know it. It took me three viewings of Mulholland Drive to really start to \\"get\\" it, and i realize now that Inland Empire makes the duality structure of Mulholland Drive look like kindergarten.<br /><br />I would say i enjoyed it on a first viewing slightly less than MD, but then again i saw IE at home, while i saw MD for the first time in a theatre, and was blown away, even though i didn't understand what i'd seen. Still, my wife and i found ourselves returning again and again to IE to discuss certain points and offer theories. It really has some amazing moments in it, but i'll need to have several viewing parties and enjoy delving deeper and deeper with each successive viewing. For now, my rating is topnotch, because it's such a gem of a creation and head and shoulders above so much that is out there.
0066620996|5.0|Our company is taking the advice of the book to heart.  We have formed our \\"hedgehog\\" group and all are excited.  We want to work in an environment of greatness.  The book shows us the way.  We have 7 of our employees who have agreed to \\"donate their time\\" at lunch several times a month to help us identify our circles.  I would recommend this book to any company or organization that truly wants to have their maximum impact in the arena in which they operate!

1843532727|4.0|When we were planning our trip to Japan, we purchased The Rough Guide to Japan, The Lonely Planet Guide to Tokyo, and The Time Out Guide to Tokyo.  If I had depended on the descriptions in The Lonely Planet Guide to decide what would be fun to do or see, I would never have left home.  The same items described in The Rough Guide were much more intriguing.  Mostly I chose what to see and do based on The Rough Guide.  Other items I picked from descriptions in The Time Out Guide.  It's strength was the culture of modern Japan, specifically things relating to anime, manga, cosplay, etc.  Rough Guide covers some of these things, but not in such depth.    None of these books, however, mentioned the Godzilla statue in Tokyo.  Admittedly, the statue is small and there's nothing to do other than take a picture, but how can you go to Tokyo and not say hi to Godzilla?    When we were in Tokyo, the maps in The Lonely Planet Guide were much more detailed and helpful than those in the other two books.  But keep in mind that Tokyo is only a small part of The Rough Guide to Japan.  I don't know how The Rough Guide to Tokyo would compare.  In Matsumoto, the only place we managed to get to outside of the Greater Tokyo/Yokohama area, The Rough Guide's map got us from the train station to the wonderful castle, Matsumoto-jo, without any trouble.    To sum up, faced with only six days in Japan (plus a day each way for travel), the Rough Guide was invaluable for deciding what we wanted to see, what we could manage to see, and which things would be worth hours on the train to get to.
0670034711|4.0|I would recommend this book! It's not a classic but entertaining.    One thing I was considering after reading this book from a man's perspective is the order: Eat, Pray, then Love.  For myself, I'd go for love then Eat while praying all along for both.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This the first blu-ray disk that i purchased and the best so far. You can appreciate more what blu ray disk has to offer with this documentary than in a movie. You can watch over and over without getting borred. Incredible details: i could see the moustache of a leopard from a far distance as it was real with a full HD 42 inch lcd.  The content is excellent, each disks offers information from different part of the world and taught me a lot. After watching it i felt like i've return from a world tour. And i keep watching it over and over. Don't hesitate its a must have blu-ray disk. The price is well worth. Thank you BBC for this excellent blu-ray and i would like to see more new BBC's documentary.
1594489505|5.0|Thousand Splendid Suns is the most intriguing novel I have ever read. The story is well narrated in a simple, dark manner.  No other book has drawn me into the characters as much as this one.   It's a rude awakening and provides a glimpse into the life of many women Afghanistan.
0142001104|5.0|This book continues to change my life. I loved their key phrases to remember their ideas.

0316018953|3.0|I love the Harry Bosch series.  He is a great character, but this book was a little disappointing.  It starts out great, with an LA murder quickly spinning into a potential terror attack.  Harry is on the scene and in control. I won't give away the plot, but Harry solves this mystery within just a few hours, leaving the rest of the LAPD, FBI and Homeland Security behind.    The book is relatively short, I guess because it was originally published as a short story and was fleshed out to book length.  It could've stood a little more fleshing out, imo.  Also, in all the Bosch books, Harry is always the smartest character in any situation.  It is a little too much sometimes, how everyone is stupid and it is up to Harry to solve the crime and save everyone from themselves.  This book is no exception but it is a little much, how Harry is such a bull in the china shop but is always the only one with any brains.  And the way he goes running to the Chief of Police when the feds won't play his way is beyond ridiculous.    There was also one page stuck in the middle of the book that was a flashback to Harry's days in Viet Nam.  It is so sudden, jarring, and just plain confusing. There is no purpose for this scene and it really throws off the rhythm of the narrative.    One other concern is that the book ends with Harry on the verge of some extremely serious health problems. His injuries are such that it seems that this must be the end of the road for Harry.  Obviously it's not, since the author is talking about future Harry books, but I will be curious to see how Harry recovers from what would realistically be fatal injuries.
B000069HKH|5.0|Wwhen I first got this cd it's all I listened to for about a month. On my car cd, at work on my pc, home on my stereo I played it over and over. Once in awhile an artist will pen songs that so define a period of history that those songs will surely live in our collective memory for ever. It shatters any doubts about the artistry of Springsteens song writing abilites though PHILADELPHIA should've done that years ago. He is not just a rocking song writer that could only write rock anthems he is an artist as fine as song writer we've ever had. Very few artists could write an album so full of lyrics and music that not only entertains but reveres and makes one aware of the desolation, anger and confusion that one day in September of 2001 caused.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|\\"Spider-Man 3\\" is a big disappointment after the heights reached by \\"Spider-Man 2\\".<br /><br />The villains are uninspired, the plot is just a random collection of ideas that doesn't add up to much, the relationship issues between Mary Jane and Peter Parker have become tiresome.<br /><br />The film looks like it has undergone some major post-production cutting (witness Mary Jane's unexplained breakup with Peter Parker) but it is all to no avail.<br /><br />The creators seem to have run out of compelling ideas. Maybe it's time to put spidey to bed.
B0000025D0|5.0|The Boss pushes back and releases the demons here. This is an angry, biting work and in it's own vein is a classic. It's fiery rock and the Boss hits some great chords on BADLANDS, ADAM RAISED A CAIN, CANDY'S ROOM, THE PROMISED LAND and DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN. It's dark, edgy, angry and one of his finest releases.

B000002B30|5.0|for the die-hard Springsteen fan, no, this collection does not have all the songs that you would hope for. It is mostly a collection of his top charting singles with a few questionable choices thrown in SECRET GARDEN? which is a great song but I wouldn't pick that over JUNGLEAND or REASON TO BELIEVE. But still pop it in the car cd player and crank it up because this is a great cd with high rockability factor and Springsteen songs are perfect for listening while you're driving. The continuity of the collection holds up pretty well considering Springsteen albums are put together almost as a storybook. I'm a Jersey boy and Springsteen fan for life so this collection is as fine as any Greatest Hits collection we could hope for.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I saw the first episode of Dexter on Fx, unfortunately I no longer have the FX channel, but I was desperate to see the rest of the series!!! Thank you so much for providing me with the answer!! The service was prompt, within no time I was watching the whole first series, a very enjoyable couple of nights!! I'll be coming straight back to buy the second series when it comes out on DVD!
B0000028SU|4.0|there are some great songs on this collection that was released in unison with HUMAN TOUCH. I think Lucky Town is the stronger album. Tunes like BETTER DAYS, LUCKY TOWN, IF I SHOULD FALL BEHIND, MY BEAUTIFUL REWARD are promises of hope and a longing for better days. I'd say LUCKY TOWN is one of Bruce's greatest and most underrated albums.
B000002MK8|5.0|IF YOU WERE A TEEN BACK IN MID TO LATE 70'S, THIS IS A MUST HAVE TO BRING BACK THOSE JOYFUL DAYS OF YOUTH. SOME TRACKS ARE BETTER THAN THE ORIGNAL TO ME.
B00000255F|5.0|Times were tough in the mid 70's, disco was all the rage, Rod Stewart was putting out a disco album for Pete's sake, it seemed all the rockers that we grew up with were abandoning rock for disco and what remained was hardly worth mentioning. I hated disco, hated going to discos, preferred to sit in a dingy bar, putting back beers and listening to rock of days gone by. Then like a bolt of lightening from the gods of rock, BORN TO RUN, came out and our world was saved. Hyperbole, you listen to this album and decide for yourself. From the opening lure of THUNDER ROAD to the frantic frenzy of TENTH AVE FREEZE OUT to the smooth undercurrent of BACKSTREETS to the pulse-sating vibes of BORN TO RUN to the secrets of MEETING ACROSS THE RIVER to the classic JUNGLELAND. Yes, this album saved rock and roll. Beg to differ?
B00006D295|5.0|I had heard for years of the midnight Rocky Horror show in Harvard Square, Cambridge, MA but never went to see it. I have now watched this campy video four times and can not get enough. When I next head back to Massachusetts I hope to check out the midnight show and see all the wonderful folks dressed up and playing the roles. How excellent!
B0000028SR|4.0|okay, so I'm a Springsteen die-hard and can't find fault with any of his recordings. This one came out in liason with LUCKY TOWN. HUMAN TOUCH is a great song that came out when Bruce was going throught some difficult personal stuff. So this collection is introspective but not as dark as some of his other work. All in all, good stuff.
0439206472|1.0|Things like a guardian trying to force a 14 year old girl to marry and tying up an infant and hanging her in a cage 30 feet in the air are REVOLTING.  Why would anyone think this is appropriate reading material for teens or children?
B0000025T6|5.0|Springsteen is an artist above all else not just a pop writing song master. NEBRASKA proves that more then any other album. Listen to the dark, haunting tunes on this collection, listen to the stories of the characters that aren't quite making it in the world, Springsteen can tell a story like no other artist in his genre. And his genre in this collection is the heart and soul of America. Springsteen can peer into the heart of the common man like Guthrie or Seeger or Dylan. This is vintage Bruce.

B0000024ZT|5.0|and he would become the Boss. Springsteens first release is full of fun, originality, witty lyrics and pure rock and roll. A great collection of songs topped by BLINDED BY THE LIGHT, GROWIN UP, ITS HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY, and SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT. The Boss and The E Street Band come alive here in the beginning of what would become a beautiful and creative relationship.

B000002513|5.0|In his 2nd release the Boss let forth a sound that would rank as one of his greatest releases or greatest depending upon your taste. Growing up in NJ this album always appealed to me as images of growing up in NJ. The characters I knew and saw. ROSALITA, ASBURY PARK, KITTYS BACK are gems in this album. If you are looking for early Springsteen that really defines the sounds that he created in some of his later albums this is the one to get.
B00005KAQP|5.0|It is no secret that Whoopi Goldberg is an amazing actress. \\"The Color Purple\\" anyone? But this is a more modern movie, a movie that anyone could appreciate.<br /><br />Whoopi plays as Deloris Van Carier, a lounge singer who's married ex-boyfriend (and mobster) is trying to have her killed because she witnessed a murder. So when she goes to the police, they place her in a convent, knowing that no one will suspect to look for her there. At first, she is itching to get out. However, she is given the opportunity to transform the choir from horrible to talented. Their performances at the church start bringing people back into the failing institute.<br /><br />And the music is extraordinary. The songs that are used were originally at the beginning of the movie as Deloris' Vegas act, but are transformed from cheap lounge songs to beautiful hymns. If the last performance in the movie doesn't send chills down your spine, I don't know what will.
B0000025KI|5.0|a two album set that chronicles the desires and hunger of a restless generation. This is my personal favorite of Springsteens early work.<br />HUNGRY HEART was the big hit off of this but there are gems all through both cd's, and all styles from pure rocking stuff to those dark, lyrical Springsteen songs we love.
0321344758|5.0|As it promises, Steve Krug's Don't Make Me Think: 2nd Edition, is a quick, but extremely usable, guide to Web usability and design. The book took me less than a day to read (less than 3 hours), but has become, in my mind, a requirement for even beginners (like myself) of Web design. Since everyone who develops for the Web should have some idea of design and usability, this book should really be a mandatory requirement for said work.<br /><br />In short, there's no reason not to read this book if you're developing for the Web (writing content, programming, etcetera), or working with a team that does so.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|So this DVD wasn't released as a double feature along with \\"Planet Terror.\\" Well boo-freakin'-hoo for all you fanboys out there who probably didn't bother to see \\"Grindhouse\\" in theaters in the first place. What the hell did you expect? \\"Grindhouse\\" - as inestimably cool as it was - was a box office disappointment! Contrary to what some reviewers here apparently believe, movie studios do not exist to appease tubby, sweaty-browed 40-year-old film geeks who live in their mothers' basements. Studios exist - from a financial perspective - to do something nobler than that. (Here's a hint: it rhymes with `make money.') Yes, I would like to have seen \\"Grindhouse\\" released as one set, trailers and all. But don't go blaming \\"Death Proof\\" for the fact that it wasn't. It's only fair, then, that we look at this movie for what it is rather than what its packaging isn't.     And what it is is easily one of the coolest, BEST movies of 2007. Of course it's talky! Have you folks never seen a Quentin Tarantino flick before? Unlike \\"Planet Terror,\\" which - self-aware as it is - sticks basically to the zombie flick formula, \\"Death Proof\\" careens between genres to come up with something not so easy to classify. It's a car chase flick/slasher movie/comedy/melodrama/morality play all at once. Sure, there are plenty of nods to the conventions of exploitation cinema past. But this is also an example of one of the rarest breeds of grindhouse films: it's an arthouse flick dressed down for a drive-in audience (think \\"Two Lane Blacktop\\" or the oft-referenced \\"Vanishing Point.\\") It's not just a movie about a killer, a car and a bunch of hot women. To some extent, it's an exploitation movie about, well, exploitation movies. It's also an awful lot of fun, maybe even better on its own than as the second half of a double bill.     Of course, some of the charm of a movie like this may be lost on people who just flat don't know their exploitation films. The choppy edits and sound jumps are easy references to catch. But you know how Stuntman Mike eats his nachos in such disgusting fashion? Or the too-low, seemingly post-sync voice of hillbilly/mechanic Jasper? Or even the long stretches of dialog? These are the kinds of nods to Z-grade cinema that make \\"Death Proof\\" so much fun for fans of all things lowbrow. And with nods to his own films (a 1/10th second flash of the title strip for \\"Miserlou\\" on a jukebox, a mention of Big Kahuna Burger), Tarantino constantly reminds us that this ain't real life. It's life the way it tends only to exist in cinema, with thrill-killing villains and vengeful heroines willing to commit all manner of mayhem from behind the wheel of a souped-up muscle car. Or, as the classic tagline for \\"Last House on the Left\\" once put it, \\"It's only a movie...only a movie...only a movie...\\"     THIS JUST IN...Sorry for adding to my initial review, but something occurred to me as I was looking over some other customer comments on this movie. I have to admit, I was a little surprised to see all the negative reviews here. But here's what I'm thinking. The BEST movies, music, books are often met with a mixed reaction from both fans and critics, at least initially. That is, in part I think, because they're different; they don't fit neatly into an expected/comfortable category. Think of a band like the Ramones who were so widely disdained through much of their career. It took a minority of hipsters years to convince the hoi polloi that this was a great, hugely important band. Or think of an album like \\"Exile on Main Street\\" - poorly reviewed upon its release, but now regarded as one of the Stones' best. Or, for a more recent example, think \\"Napoleon Dynamite.\\" A lot of people absolutely HATED this movie. Very simply, they were wrong. They missed its heart and its sweetness, didn't get the jokes and, probably, wanted something along the lines of \\"American Pie.\\"     So, anyone going into \\"Death Proof\\" expecting a modern action movie is going to be taken aback. This isn't \\"The Fast and the Furious,\\" thank God. This movie, like \\"Reservoir Dogs,\\" is about dialog more than demolition. It's about building tension. And, for you folks who seemingly have never seen an action flick from 30 years ago, it's also MUCH more in line with the pacing of 70s exploitation/action/drive-in cinema than you think it is. Take a look back at \\"Bullitt\\" or \\"The French Connection.\\" Granted, these were top-tier features of their day - they weren't grindhouse flicks. But they're also very talky cop movies which have a grand total of one car chase apiece. LOTS of drive-in flicks were very much the same: long on talk with a little action.     The point is, I guess, that \\"Death Proof\\" really is a very good movie, though people expecting a Vin Diesel crashfest (ie: the comfortable crap they're used to) aren't going to think so. But time will prove them wrong just as it has for detractors of the Ramones, \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and \\"Napoleon Dynamite.\\"
1400077915|5.0|What a wonderful collection of stories. I am not typically a fan of the short story genre and I wouldn't have read this if it wasn't on the reading list for my book club. I just finished this and I am ready to start reading another of her collections of short stories. I highly recommend this book!
B00005JPD0|5.0|Deja Vu is a movie that shouldn't have worked. This genre of movie was tried before in movies like TimeCop and 12 Monkeys and failed. It is a sci-fi time travel/crime drama, two types of movies that mix about as well as oil and water. It is possible that this movie would not have worked with a lesser actor in the lead role, that the silliness of the concept - that the U.S. government accidently develops a time machine that can see only only a few hours into the past and is fatal to anybody who tries to use it to travel and, by the way, only works within a radius of a few miles, and, by the way, also fits into the back of a semi-truck so it can be hauled around - would have killed the movie. However, Denzel Washington approaches the whole concept with, at first, the contempt and ridicule it deserves. Then he decides, if this junk is real, why should he accept the rules that he must only watch and do nothing to change the past - or future - and prevent another 911 style attack. The movie skillfully unfolds with tantelizing hints that Denzel has done just that - has been tampering with the time-stream all along, only he just hasn't done it yet. The director throws in an interesting and unnecessary cross-time car chase just to get the action rolling at one point. The movie has a satisfying ending. It's worth watching to see a sci-fi movie closer to home, with Chevys instead of space ships, and cell phones instead of phaser pistols.
075640407X|5.0|The thing that really hit me about this book is how real it seemed.  Yes, it's in the Fantasy genre; yes, it has magic and adventure; and yes, it has a University for magical learning (nothing like Harry Potter).  But somehow it all seemed so real and authentic--like it actually happened and is being recounted for our benefit.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss is a master of character development and that is apparent from page one.  Characters grow before our eyes and mature at a very realistic pace.  Simply put, Kvothe's pain becomes the reader's pain and his accomplishments made me want to shout out while pumping my fist in the air like some crazed sports fan.  The dialog is believable, the events are richly detailed, and the character interaction is beautifully crafted.<br /><br />Of course, the novel isn't perfect, but its pretty close.  If I hadn't known this was the first of a trilogy then I would have been enraged over the \\"aaand CUT!\\" style ending.  But there will be more and the ending left me thirsty for it.  Highly recommend.
B000H7J9QM|4.0|A must for your BD collection!<br /><br />Still trying to get used to the blonde hair though.....
B000002868|5.0|Well it's 1971,Miles Davis's [[ASIN:B00000J7SS Bitches Brew]] was a year old and the new musical style of fusion was in full throttle.And with the expressive keyboardist Joe Zawinul leading the way Weather Report got off to a great start with this particular recording (their first) and got things started just the right way with \\"Milky Way\\", longing bursts of synthesizer melodies from Zawinul and,if you listen with headphones you'll actually hear him adjusting the controls on his synths to open envelopes and such. Most of the rest of the music here is very closly linked to that of Miles's-a similar subversive groove but substituting Miles's overwelming business with a stripped down,subdued tone as well as a strong degree of emotional aloofness.\\"Umbrellas\\" again finds Zawinul expressing himself well on the keys and \\"Orange Lady\\",a true highlite of this album changes tones in so many surprising and exciting ways that you'll have to keep your ears open. Wayne Shorter's contributions to this album are less solos then melodic (or unmelodic depending on what the composition demanded) bursts of sax flowing in and out-it's Airto's percussion that takes the spotlight with Zawinul most of the time and as we all know that sure isn't a bad thing. One obvious thing about this album,which you'll find in these reviews and even in the CD's liner notes is that this isn't an \\"overt\\" album-nothing rocks out,flips out or gets too too funky. Out of the three this album has more funk oriented moments but the musical interplay is somewhat rigid and chilly compared to the bright carnavalesqe atmosphere Weather Report would develope in the mid 70's. In fact if you were to take this bands name literally the \\"weather report\\" for this album would probably read something like 'lowery clouds with a chance of...more lowery clouds'-creativity and drama were obviously in the cards for these musicians while making this music,not necessarily emotional resonance. Yet at the same time that stark minimal streak gives this recording a very relaxing feel for those who listen.For fans of Miles's earliest forrways into jazz fusion 'Weather Report' certainly goes right along with it.streak gives this recording a very relaxing feel for those who listen.For fans of Miles's earliest forrways into jazz fusion 'Weather Report' certainly goes right along with it.
B000UFAURI|5.0|Unlike most of the reviews here I would say that the album gets better as it goes on culminating in Home which is by far the best song on the album.
0553260111|4.0|Jason Bourne, the hero is brought to life by Robert Ludlum. The author has a gift to bring this character to a stage that you can almost live his life with him, feel his distress and his agony. The story was very captivating and it was a thrilling read.<br /> When it comes to the \\"spy\\" novel, there are few writers that exceed Robert Ludlum's talents. When I finished reading this book I came to this conclusion that most \\"thriller\\" writers fall way short. The book is fairly long, so set back and enjoy several evenings of an exciting, wonderful story. I look forward to reading the sequel to this book. Highly recommend.
B000003CMB|5.0|The reason I bought this album is because one, I love 70's classic rock and especially lengthy guitar jams, and two, because everyone said it was the ultimate live rock album featuring exciting, spectacular jamming.  Is that true?  Yes, for the most part.  I have a small problem with the track sequencing, but other than that, yes, At the Fillmore probably deserves to be called a classic.      \\"Statesboro Blues\\" opens the album.  While I'm not crazy about the studio version, the guitar soloing is pretty loud, clean and fantastic here.  Probably the ultimate blues rock song, and because I have family down around the Statesboro area, I'm biased.  It's a great way to open the album, not to mention an appropriate way.  After all, we're talking about a southern rock band here.  You'd expect a blues/southern tune to be the opener, and that's what it is.  \\"Done Somebody Wrong\\" is the next track, and this is where I have a problem with the order of tracks.  The style and mood is very similar to the previous song, and I believe it was a mistake to open the album with two bluesy rockers in a row.  It's a great song though, especially the harmonica parts.  I just wish the song had appeared somewhere towards the middle of the album.      \\"Stormy Monday\\" is where Greg's vocals really amaze me, along with the sound quality of the album.  These are the kind of songs that show people why the Allman Brothers Band were such a good live band.  You can really feel the mood of the atmosphere, and you don't want the song to ever end, sort of like the Doors classic \\"Riders on the Storm\\".  Everyone wants that song to last forever, and the same can be said here.  \\"You Don't Love Me/Soul Serenade\\" is REALLY a cool song that goes through all sorts of keyboard and guitar sections.  That little keyboard riff that keeps repeating immediately following the verse melody is SO good.  After the vocals are over, the rest of the tune is about HEAVY instrumental jamming.      \\"Hot 'Lanta\\" is a track tosatisfy the hard rock lovers out there.   A great, exciting song.  This version of \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" is MUCH better compared to the shorter studio version.  That's because live, the band extends the song and adds more melodic guitar jamming for several extra minutes.  The album finishes up with \\"Whipping Post\\", a 20+ minute BRILLIANT piece of guitar jamming.  The song goes through so many emotional shifts and melodic changes that I have no choice but to declare THIS the ultimate guitar jam of the 70's.  Yup, and I know there's many bands back in the day who jammed like crazy and quite frequently, but this song, THIS song... it totally rules.    Alright, you need to own this album.  It's over 75 minutes of brilliance.
B000MQ54OO|1.0|I expected a LOT more.  This show is hard to watch without a chilled bottle of Pepto Bismal and a curly straw.    It's not quality like Disney.  Not even close.  No adult humor - no story or plot, just bad singing & Penguins.    This movie has a story you could sum up in three sentences.  1.  All penguins sing to attract a mate.  2.  There is one little retarded penguin that can't sing, but he can tap dance.  3.  Evenually, after 1 hour and 20 minutes of boring melodrama, the penguin of his dreams realizes that she was shallow, and she now appreciates his dancing.    Avoid this.  Especially in Hi Def.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Thick as a Brick is one completely enjoyable album.  The vocals are spectacular, the melodies are pleasing, the flute playing is brilliant, and the keyboard solos resemble Deep Purple sometimes.  Ian Anderson is an acquired taste, so having an appreciation for his vocal style is necessary in order to really get into the music.  I like the atmosphere here more than on other Jethro Tull albums because the music on Thick as a Brick reminds me of winter, and having snowball fights with kids.  Some of the darker moments on the album are quite creepy and sound like something from a Harry Potter movie.  I think it's Ian's ability to progress his vocal style from happy and snappy to creepy and disturbing that makes me think this way.  The album is now known to feature one of the longest songs of all-time- the entire album is one 43-minute song, haha.  Well, don't let that bother you.  It's good stuff!
B000002UJQ|5.0|It's one of the top-5 albums of all time, and gets better every time you listen to it.  Not much left to say on the topic.
1401917186|4.0|I purchased this book along with Earth Angels, both were fairly inexpensive which was nice. Also the size is great if you want to take something along with you when you might have a wait (Dr. office, etc.)  Overall both books were interesting to me, and I felt like I did not waste my money. The only real 'complaint' I have with this book is unlike Earth Angels, it did not have the little quiz to see which Earth Angel you would fit in most with. If it had that little quiz, I would not have bought the first book, as this book is more or less a repeat of what the first book had, but with a tad bit more information.  I did feel like the first book, and this one answered some questions for me. A lot of what I read in both books made sense to me, also it was interesting to read about all the other Earth Angels.  Again like I mentioned before, if this book had the quiz that came with the first book, I would have not bought the first book. I believe it is thought that everyone who has the first book would buy this book and those who hadn't read either one would do like I did and pick up both books.  It was an interesting book; tho it would be nice if it even more information. Also if it had the quiz so one wouldn't 'have' to buy the first book to test and see which category they fit into most.  I do recommend this book as an interesting read, it definatly opened my eyes and gave insight as to why I am the way I am about some things. Also the price was not bad at all, which makes it all the more appealing to buy.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|It's so over the top, you can decide if you should laugh out loud.  It doesn't matter.  I don't care.  It's awesome.
1594489505|4.0|This book was excellent. I loved the way it entertwined the story with bits and pieces of Aphgani history, cutlture, and current events. It gives the reader a glimpse of what life was like during war, and for women in particular. Hosseini is an excellent writer. I am now reading Kite Runner and am just as mezmerized by that story as I was with this one.  The only reason why I did not give this book 5 stars is because I feel as though the ending could have been fleshed out a little more.  Overall I was satisfied but felt as though a few more details were needed.
0553588486|5.0|George RR Martin is, in my opinion, one of the best Fantasy authors currently writing. He's great at exploring and deepening characters without them coming out and saying \\"I'm brave but flawed by my childhood experience\\", but instead he shows them by their reactions and choices. Yes, this shouldn't be a big deal, but hey, it's fantasy.<br /><br />I also love that his characters are fully grey. The ones that are truly honorable heroes are also unyieldingly cold and the cruelest villians are at least human and understandable. But man! Martin doesn't mind killing anybody.<br /><br />Which brings me to my title. One of the hardest things is picking up the next book that isn't from this series. You can always go back to some of the classics, but it's really hit and miss on picking up a new book, and Martin really raised the bar for me.
0895260131|1.0|This book reinforces the medias hold on our society...once you have been fed something for so long (in this case that Islam is bad) it is quite easy to belief when people start picking apart pieces...i embraced Islam 1 1/2 years ago and it was the best decision i have ever made...i do not prescribe to some of the most socially damaging behaviours of our time drinking/premarital sex/overindulgence in material possessions/environemenatl damage....Islam has put all these things in perspective for me and has given me a foundation and guidance as to how to achieve these things.....<br />I love all people and respect their beliefs and literature like this CREATES FURTHER DISTANCE BETWEEN HUMANKIND......like we need anymore hate and discrimination....
B000UGG3A0|5.0|Another rockin' DKM Album.  It follows their usual formula: their own music with a couple of traditional Irish songs juiced up.
0743486285|4.0|I started this book and finished it about 48 hours. It kept my attention and flowed with the shock-factor nicely divvied up throughout the book. I like the fact that proceeds will go to a benefit. The soundtrack goes along with it nicely. Kudos to Nikki Sixx, pulling skeletons from the closet seems to have worked for him.
B000UGG39Q|4.0|A lot has happened in the five years since the release of Down's previous album.  Phil Anselmo and Rex Brown's former Pantera bandmate Dimebag Darrell was senselessly murdered not long after the band disbanded, and New Orleans, the hometown to most of Down's members, was devestated by Hurricane Katrina.  All the tragedy and sadness that has been experienced has been laced into \\"Over the Under\\", which re-unites Phil, Rex, Corrosion of Conformity frontman Pepper Keenan, Crowbar's Kirk Windstein, and Eyehategod's Jimmy Bower; and all five pour their emotion into their music.  They also manage to concoct the best brand of southern-fueled hard rock, which shouldn't really be a surprise to anyone really.  Phil does much less screaming here and really puts his heart and soul into his lyrics, while the rest of the band is what you would expect to hear if you're a fan of Down or any of the member's other outfits.  Opening track \\"Three Suns and One Star\\", \\"The Path\\", \\"On March the Saints\\", the aptly titled \\"Mourn\\", and the \\"Jail\\"-flavored \\"His Majesty the Desert\\" are spectacular and uncompromising in their delivery.  There's no real instantly listenable tracks here like \\"Stone the Crows\\", but make no mistake that that is not a bad thing.  It should be also noted that \\"Over the Under\\" is a different animal than what was heard on \\"NOLA\\" and even \\"A Bustle in Your Hedgerow\\"; but don't let that put you off of this.  All in all, \\"Over the Under\\" is a triumphant return for the beloved Down, and here's hoping that there will be more to come with less tragedy to fuel it.
B0000025DR|5.0|Great classic ELO music.  Includes great songs that don't make it to the ELO collections.
B0000549B0|5.0|Jimmy Steward is one of the BEST actors to grace the screen.   This is one of his that you cannot do without in your library.  The premise and thecast of characters is hillarious.
B000J233SK|5.0|Loreena McKennitt's CD, The Book of Secrets, is a pleasing example of Celtic fusion music.
B000002IAS|5.0|Clapton's earlier adventures with Cream and Blind Faith may have covered the overhead for this album, but for the first time since he'd left the Bluesbreakers he was surrounded by musicians with a similar taste and capacity for precise, very subtle R&B.  Again he's playing with heavyweights in popular music, but all the pretense of a Ginger Baker drum solo has been replaced by the sincere effusion of Delanie & Bonnie Bramlett's vocals and the economy of guitarist Dave Mason, who had already orchestrated the mainstream success of Traffic's first two albums.  What is on show in the 42 1/2 minutes of this album is an ostensibly modest yet very rich and triumphant live performance, surprisingly so in that it was recorded well after Manson and Altamont had sullied 60's idealism.  Perhaps this album reflects the more lyrical and traditional forms into which such idealism would have to be diverted in the new decade, but for all that there is yet in Croydon in 1969 no need to stop dancing and singing along.  As the AMG review indicates, Clapton would take the core of Delanie & Bonnie's backing band into the studio to cut not only his first solo album but the equally precise and iconic blues-rock of Derek & the Dominoes.
1594200696|5.0|Very clear instruction and easy to accept; it does not insult the reader. This edition's layout is beautiful (especially the covers). The llustrations are of an unexpected style. They may not add to every reader's experience.
B000KJU1MS|5.0|I absolutely love the Kissology series.  Parts 1 and 2 are both outstanding in their coverage of the band in each era.  While there is a lot that the fans have seen, I have personally found tons of killer video that I had never uncovered.<br /><br />Nevermind the quality of some of the clips.  For the most part, the video is well put together and I'll take the archival of the history over perfect quality any day.<br /><br />The Cadillac, Michigan documentary is FANTASTIC!  I think this is the gem of this volume.  The Acrobat live video is cool as well even though it's grainy.<br /><br />The concerts are cool.  Nothing polished live, thank you, it's just the way they performed.  Nothing wrong with honesty.<br /><br />I fell away from the Kiss Army for several years but I am so glad to have these videos as my definitive KISS collection.<br /><br />LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!
B00005JPQR|2.0|Oh how *subtle.* While rogue CIA director Ezra Kramer is plotting to murder Americans and use Pamela Landy as the fall gal, the director sticks an American flag on Kramer's desk. That's subtlety in American cinema right there pal. And if visual depiction of contempt for American patriotism isn't enough, how about the stock \\"the-rogue-CIA-is-out-to-kill-you\\" plot? If you want better movies using that now-overworked plot, look no further than the much better done film \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" or even \\"Clear and Present Danger.\\"    Kyle Smith, film critic for the New York Post, takes a similar, but more left-right theme in his review (humorously titled \\"When Liberals Attack\\"):    \\"Bourne himself resolves the great contradiction bedeviling the liberal action movie--namely, how do you make your hero a killing machine . . . without making him politically incorrect and illiberal along the way? The ingenious solution is to make Bourne an unwilling killing machine, a man whose body is a weapon that his amnesia-ridden mind doesn't understand, or even quite control... Scenes of a captive Bourne being hooded and waterboarded in intentionally dehumanizing training sessions also tickle one of the left's most accessible pleasure centers, the one marked Gitmo guilt.\\"     LOL.  I wish I could write prose as good as Mr. Smith's.    Besides the problem mentioned above, I must also reiterate the same problem I had with \\"Bourne Identity\\": the premise of the books was Jason Bourne as a good guy who lost his memory, not an amoral assassin who lost his memory after being subjected to brainwashing like something straight out of \\"Blood Diamond.\\"    Look, I appreciate Julia Stiles coming back. That was good. A little coincidental, but good. However, that, and great star power, and lots of explosions, and good chase scenes, and exotic locales, just don't make up for this movie that at its heart doesn't like, want or care about your country.*    *  Of course, if you're not American, you'll probably love this film, since it both confirms and panders to your fears, stereotypes and prejudices about the U.S.  Perhaps the film's political bias is simple recognition that overseas revenues constitute an important part of its total gross.
B000009HF2|5.0|This album  never seems to become out of date.  I guess it is the unique guitar sound and the range of musical styles that always keeps it fresh.  From rock numbers to more mellow songs the quality is consistant.  PF is a guitar legend combined with a versatile singing voice makes this a must have album for me. Get a piece of music history- get this album into your collection.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is not a series that you come away from watching saying \\"hey that was fantastic\\", even though the cinemetography is incredible and the stories are wrenching and involved.  But, the series is incredible in it's scope and depth and get's to your core concerning the sacrifices that men and women made (from all countries) for our freedoms.  It really gives a perspective to those of us who have never encountered such atrocities and reminds us why we never want to see them again.  Peace and respect.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|The box contains all series of Friends. There's also a small book with the story to each actor and how the serie got started. It's a must be for every Friends-Fan.
B000RJO578|4.0|Although I enjoyed \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" with Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, I didn't keep my copy of it. I absolutely loved \\"Hot Fuzz\\" and will definitely be getting the DVD. Pegg has shown some maturity and chops development and continues to make me want to see him in more roles. Wright is a competant actor as well and I'm sure they will both go on to bigger and better roles. This particular comedy had much more development and far more funny moments than \\"Shaun of the Dead\\". So along with the great acting from the cast I must applaud the writing and directing behind it. This is the funniest movie I have seen in a couple years. There are some obvious spoofs of movies like \\"Point Break\\" and \\"Bad Boys\\" which they even watch one evening.<br /><br />An officer, played by Pegg, that had graduated at the top of his class, is so good at his work in London they don't want him making the rest the service looking bad. They send him off to a rural town to get him out of the way. Wright plays the officer that is his partner at the town. The rural town seems peaceful enough and at first it seems the worst he can expect are some unruly kids. But murders soon start occurring and his investigations run deeper than he ever imagined. A sinister plot becomes evident and he must declare war and go no holds barred into the town to see that justice is served. If you enjoy cop movies or comedies be sure to catch this wonderfully funny movie.
B000055Y0X|5.0|All of Kubrick's movies are challenging and interesting and watchable, but only a few hold together completely.  Dr. Strangelove is one of them.  It's both funny and thoughtful, timely and timeless.  You can still watch this movie today and cringe when you think of the sorts of individuals with their fingers poised over the red buttons.  The other best Kubricks are Lolita, Spartacus and Clockwork Orange.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I work from home and always have music playing in the background while working on computer. In the past it's always been instrumental music, i.e LifeScapes \\"Music for Stress Relief\\" and others. I've always found \\"vocal\\" music to be too distracting till I bought this CD. What a joy to listen to. Relaxing, yet uplifting and sexy at the same time! Great collection of songs. Very happy with this purchase!
B000W4HJ44|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the year!! The entire cast is amazing. If you liked Rent, and Phantom of the Opera you must see this movie. You will be entertained from beginning to end. It has everything from moral views to just making you laugh out loud and dancing in your seat. Nikki Blonsky is a real find. Zach Efron is great, Michelle Pfeiffer is wicked and John Travolta is hysterical. Buy it and enjoy!!!
B000OCZD5G|4.0|\\"The Road Warrior\\" is one of my all-time favorite action movies, and I've always been on the lookout for a decent home video presentation after I saw it on its original theatrical release.    I've had the VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD versions, all of which were OK, but never until now have I been truly impressed.    Almost the entire film looks absolutely perfect, with the exception of a few night scenes that exhibit grain, but I think that was on the original film.    Although this was originally recorded in mono sound (I think), the 5.1 mix is nicely done and sounds natural, although it's not overpowering.    And all you whippersnappers who haven't seen this, see how REAL car stunts are done. It's so much more impressive when you know it's not CGI : )    Definitely recommend.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore has been trying to generate some interest in this issue of global warming, but he doesn't seem to be having much success. Some of us seem to think that human generated global warming is pretty likely, but, basicly, those who could get the largest polluter nation involved are pretty much just paying a little lip service to the idea and completely ignoring it. Mostly, it would seem, we are preferring to pursue ill conceived war, heavier hummers, continued unlivable minimum wages, immigration to compensate for domestic population control attempts, and higher and higher priced medical care, unrestricted rewards for out of control medecine profits and campaign donations, and little or no interest in changing any of it. Rather, we seem, mostly, to be enjoying this thoughtless decadence. Responsibility isn't where our bread is buttered.    What are our dreams then? Certainly not protecting our environment and our fellow inhabitants of the planet. To become a failing CEO perhaps, with a thirty million dollar bonus anyway? Or, we might just become a motion picture star of the tabloids. Thus, we make the planet small. Thankyou.
B000I0RR76|5.0|When Warner released the 2-disc Adventures of Robin Hood DVD, they justly received many accolades, and it ended up on a lot of reviewers \\"best of the year\\" lists.    Why? First of all, the film is one of the most joyful and fun-filled movies ever made, and the best Robin Hood ever filmed. The 1938 technicolor classic was restored from its original elements, and looks absolutely pristine. The mono soundtrack was retained, as it should be.     If only the restored film was on this disc, it would be a must-buy, but the extras put it WAY over the top. How about 3 Looney Toons classics in HD? How about the option to watch it \\"Night at the Movies\\" style, which includes newsreels and shorts that would be shown before it originally? How about documentaries on every step of the production, and even a Warner gag reel that was shown at their annual Xmas party? How about all of that in HD?    Get it. Now. You won't regret it.
061328500X|5.0|This is a great story book. The 5 stars is for that.    I bought three editions for different kids:  [[ASIN:061328500X Good Night, Gorilla (Picture Puffin Books (Sagebrush))]], [[ASIN:0399230033 Good Night, Gorilla]], and [[ASIN:0399242600 Good Night, Gorilla (oversized board book)]]. The Puffin edition is bound in a way that makes it difficult to open flat. The paper is thinner than most good hardcover children's books. The two board book editions are very nice. You also might want to try the regular hardcover edition.
B000FGG60W|5.0|Pitch Black is a guilty pleasure. Sure, you've seen most of the aspects of this film done before in movies like Aliens, Escape from New York, etc. But this is a completely satisfying remix of those elements, and is far superior to the sequel, \\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\", which tried too hard.    Most of the film is desaturated and tinted to represent the discoloration that 3 suns shining simultaneously would present. I was afraid that this would make the presentation less convincing in HD. I was wrong.    The picture is fantastic throughout (not QUITE as 3-d looking as the later \\"Chronicles of Riddick\\", which is showcase material), definitely an upgrade to the already quite good DVD.    The sound is also quite stunning. I've always used the original DVD's DTS crash sequence when testing my surround sound calibration... this is even better. There is also extensive use of the surrounds when the creatures are circling.    If you like the movie, get it.     Definitely recommend.
B000007638|5.0|After the breakup of the Beatles and several solo albums, Paul McCartney put together the band Wings in the early 70's.  Unlike his solo efforts the idea behind Wings was for it to be a true band with writing contributions from all of it's members.  In 1976 Paul decided to take Wings on the road with a massive U.S. tour and this album is the result.  When this first came out it was a 3 record vinyl set.  The CD version is a two disc set.  This is really a great live album.  Sir Paul had not toured since his early Beatles days back in the mid 60's which made this tour that much more of an event.  What I really like about this version of Wings is that they could really rock.  There is some seriously heavy stuff on this album and McCartney could scream with the best of them when he wanted to.  Venus And Mars, Soily, Sprits Of Ancient Egypt, Live And Let Die, Hi Hi Hi, Time To Hide, and Medicine Jar are all powerful and rock out as hard as anything Paul has done before or since.  Jimmy McCulloch's lead guitar is in great throughout and Joe English on drums really stands out as well.  Paul's bass playing is also outstanding and the vocals are for the most part pristine.  Most of this album is from Macca's non Beatle years, but he does throw in 5 Beatles tunes as well.  A mostly acoustic set is included here and you also get some of Paul's more commercial Silly Love Songs.  This album paints a very good picture of Wings at the height of their powers and is a great overview of McCartney's career up to that point.
0743486285|4.0|Nikki Sixx is really a hero--in the truest sense. Here is a young man who has everything against him and yet he succeeds. He becomes exactly what he dreamed--A HUGE ROCK STAR. He dives in head first--living HUGE. In addition to the enormous success he achieves, he also does the somewhat cliche thing. He becomes an a drug addict. But fortunately for us he does the \\"un-cool\\" thing rahter than die, he beats his addiction. I don't know how many other people can or do overcome something like heroin addiction, but he should certainly feel a huge sense of accomplishment. The reason this book works when others fail is that Nikki Sixx is willing to be honest--ugly, unloved, vulnerable, and reflective. When others just gloss over addiction, he shows the ugliness of it. In doing this he gives a huge amount of hope to others. And you know what makes this an even cooler story--he is donating the profits to help young people--like his former self. That bright, young kid who wasn't given a shot. He is donating the profits to homeless teens. Even if you are not in to Motley Crue, buy this book.

B000MTDRKE|4.0|THE BAND: Neal Morse (vocals, keyboards, guitars), with Randy George (bass), and Dream Theater's Mike Portnoy (drums & percussion). Guest artist - Paul Gilbert (guitar).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2007) 4 tracks clocking in at approximately 75 minutes. Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits/times, song lyrics, artwork relating to songs, and thank you's. 3 of the 4 songs (the long ones) are divided into 6 subsections. All music & lyrics written by Morse. Label - Metal Blade Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: The musicianship on \\"Sola Scriptura\\" is 2nd to none. So why am I vexed about this 4th solo release from Morse? His other solo albums \\"Testify\\", \\"One\\" and \\"?\\" (from 2003-2005) were all good as well, but for whatever reason I wasn't left with the distinct impression that I was being preached to in a Sunday morning church service. I'm old school about religion and I feel that mixing scriptural beliefs and music are somehow best left in the sanctuary. I have to keep reminding myself - Morse is a Christian artist first and foremost now... and this is a Christian rock album. As for the music on \\"Sola\\" - Morse's guitar/keyboard playing and vocal delivery are wonderful. I truly believe his guitar playing is underrated. He's an incredibly talented man and his elaborate music is so far beyond what so many band's are trying to create today. To date, his days with Spock's Beard are still my favorite - with incredible albums like \\"The Kindness Of Strangers\\" (1998), \\"V\\" (2000), and the amazing double concept album \\"Snow\\" (2002). Mike Portnoy's drumming, as always, is effortlessly superb. Whether Portnoy's playing in his regular band Dream Theater, or his various side projects (Transatlantic, Liquid Tension Experiment, OSI, Yellow Matter Custard, John Arch, or here with Morse), he remains one of the best progressive rock drummers working today. Paul Gilbert's appearance on the last section of track 1 (\\"Upon The Door\\"), and the 1st part of track 2 (\\"Do You Know My Name\\") absolutely shred. Also within track 2 is Gilbert's Spanish flamenco section (\\"Two Down, One To Go\\") ... simply beautiful. Not to mention, Gilbert adds a completely different dimension to the song - the light guitar with the jazzy piano is downright smooth. The highlight here for me is the 29-minute opener \\"The Door\\" - filled with brilliant heavy jams (guitar and keyboard leads) and light acoustic moments. The album cover is interesting - subject matter (knowing Morse's beliefs, that could be him sweeping the stone floor), simplicity, lighting/tone and layout. As for the lyrics (i.e. - \\"In the name of God you must die\\"; \\"To live with you forever, and feel the beauty of your truth, this is all I've asked for, to live a life that's pleasing to you\\"; \\"Oh God I seek the glory that's from you... please come & make me holy\\"; \\"In the name of God you must pay your penance\\"; \\"God took the Promised Land and put it in my bloodstained hand\\"; \\"God will make a way, He will decide my fate\\"; \\"I ask myself one question - what would Jesus do?\\"... and numerous mentions of Jesus, salvation & Heaven). For me, the holy message just don't mix with the progressive music. I'd never push my beliefs on anyone and I certainly don't want anyone else's pushed on me. The subject(s) here are heavy, personal and spiritual... and for some reason I guess I'm still looking for action and adventure. I also know I'm not spiritually on the same level as Morse (yet). I admire what Morse is doing here and I know he's a changed man in the devotional sense... but for me - great music, but his sermonic words just don't do it for me (4 stars).e\\") absolutely shred.

0743298020|5.0|I've read so many wonderful books by first time novelists this year, and The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield will certainly join the ranks of Audrey Niffenegger and Elizabeth Kostova. This is another one of those unread treasures that has been sitting on my shelf and it makes me wonder what other visionary treats lie there in waiting.    The Thirteenth Tale is a prime example of storytelling at it's top form. Margaret Lea is a young woman who works at her father's bookshop which specializes in rare and antiquarian books. She's been surrounded by books throughout her life and has grown comfortable with the classics such as Jane Eyre, Middlemarch, The Woman in White, etc. and has shied away from more contemporary literature. That is, until she is summonsed by Vida Winter, a top selling novelist with a mysterious past who has requested that Margaret record the story of her life. Margaret is a bit leary of the commission, but accepts and finds that she must face her own ghosts while recording the ghosts of Ms. Winter's past - a past that reveals that the truth is often stranger than fiction.    There are so many things that I loved about this book. The characters are wonderful. Vida Winter is someone that I wish truly existed just so that I could sit in her library in front of her fireplace and listen to her tell me her stories. But of course, the wonderful Diane Setterfield, who wrote Vida Winter's character does exist ;) The storytelling aspect of this novel was just perfect. There wasn't a single moment in the novel when I was bored. There's constantly a hook to grab you and the story is always appealing.    I haven't read Daniel Wallace's book, Big Fish, but much of this novel reminded of a gothic version of the film. It's a tale of a past that's truly bizarre, yet grounded in fact. This novel could easily be translated to the big screen and make a beautiful film by the way. Setterfield paints a very vivid picture in her descriptions of the landscapes, her characters appearances, the libraries, etc.    I'm so glad that I've finally joined the other half of the world that's read this book! I've been saying this a lot lately, but here's another author that I really look forward to following throughout her career. Setterfield certainly has a promising future ahead of her if she continues to turn out novels that deliver as well as this one did.
0743544676|5.0|This audio book is pure genious!  It's straight-shooting, blunt, and full of \\"tough love\\" which hopefully will knock some sense into those of us who hang on to guys way too long hoping things will \\"get better\\".  It's an easy listen, because you know it speaks to you.  You will truly feel that Greg & Liz are your caring friends or siblings when you listen to their advice.  I only wish Greg's live comedy show incorporated some of the material in the book, rather than the endless vulgarity he seems to think is necessary to be funny in a live performance.  Stick to writing books, Greg!  That's where your true talent is...
B000P46QIG|4.0|I've been getting into Derek Sherinian's solo material and Planet X (which he started with drummer Virgil Donati) for about the past four years. I must say I've been impressed with most everything he's done since leaving Dream Theater. He takes progressive rock, metal, jazz fusion and electronic and combines them in unique ways. His keyboard sound and style are somewhat similar to Jan Hammer -- however he loves to get the hottest guitar players on earth to solo all over his music, so you only get so many Derek solos per album.     (I refer to this as Derek's solo material only because I've always viewed Planet X as really being a Derek Sherinian solo project. However I'm wrong, because Donati contributed heavily to this album, and he's the other half of the band. Either way, to me Derek's solo albums and Planet X are pretty much interchangeable.)    In this case he has Alan Holdsworth and Brett Garsed sitting in on guitar. Holdsworth, who should need no introduction, appears on only a few tracks while Garsed, who is equally superb, handles the bulk of the work.     I think this new release is fantastic, a real solid effort. In fact, I'd take this release over the new Dream Theater hands down. The compositions are creative and unique, the musicianship defies human capability and the engineering is superb.    Unfortunately, at times this also suffers from some of the same pitfalls that plague the genre: that is to say the music becomes so technical at times that it loses its \\"soul.\\" And there are times when it just overwhelms you: the first night I was listening to this with the headphones, I had barely made it through track 5 when I had to take a break. The rapid time changes and the endlessly cascading runs of notes just started to confuse my poor brain. I thought, \\"wow, it's like the Japanese animation -- this stuff could cause a seizure.\\" It is that super fast paced.    Now, after many more listens, I don't feel that way as much -- now that I've come to anticipatewhat's coming and to understand what the band is trying to accomplish with each composition. In that sense this music kind of grows on you. But then again I was into the Flower Kings a few years back and now I'm not for some reason. I guess my only complaint is that there are certain passages in the music that are \\"mechanical\\" sounding. And at times there seems to be a certain air of pretentiousness, a sense that its \\"chops for chops' sake.\\" (At the same time though I give Planet X with credit for sounding less contrived than Dream Theater or Liquid Tension Experiment.)    Despite these criticisms I still find it really enjoyable, thus I give it four stars. So, if you're into Dream Theater, Liquid Tension Experiment, Transatlantic, The Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, Neal Morse, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani or any of that complex instrumental rock that is oh so indulgent -- and you also have a taste for jazz fusion -- you'll probably find this release highly entertaining and well worth the money.
B00002SSKI|5.0|\\"Now and Then\\" was a film I picked up entirely by accident and I'm very glad I did.  It's a great character study of one summer in four girls' lives and how that summer changed them.  The music, props, and general culture 'take you back.' Anyone besides me remember when sneakers were only Keds?  When divorce was whispered about?  When news was papers in books instead of microfilm and now CD?  That's the era you go back to.  Take a look at the people and the times and see how it shaped those girls.  Very well done!
0784010218|5.0|Review no. 293. Even twenty years following it's original release, this heart warming well produced and well scripted drama is fun to watch. Heck, you could watch this movie with anyone. Someone special you're dating, a grandparent, your kids, etc. 'Dirty Dancing' is one of those films that take place in a more innocent time {circa, 1963 in the Catskill Mountains} that's a nice clean family oriented movie, YET hasn't at all become stale or out dated through out the harsh test of time. It's cast of well reknown actors and actresses, Patrick Swayze (this movie made him a star), Jennifer Grey, Jerry Orbach and Cynthia Rhoades doesn't hurt either. Some of the beloved oldies through out this flick will send chills up and down your spine. Best scene is the last ten minutes during the big dance's major finale. Recommended, big time.
B0000019PA|5.0|I would put Aeroplane up there with Sgt. Peppers, Ziggy Stardust, Dark Side, Murmer, OK Computer, The Queen is Dead, Unforgettable Fire.  It's that great.  This album changed the way I listen to music.  And Jeff Mangum (along with Elliott Smith) inspired me to finally pick up a guitar.<br />Everyone should \\"experience\\" this masterpiece at least once.
B000OYCN98|4.0|Reason I'm giving this 2-CD, 1 DVD repackaging of the landmark Hawkwind live 1972 album is because of the asking price. I already own copies of the One Way 2-CD reissue as well as the later EMI import reissue with the concert's two encore songs. So, what do I need with this pressing? The twenty song DVD is packed with Hawkwind classics like \\"Space Is Deep\\", \\"Orgone Accumulator\\", \\"Brainstorm\\" and so on but sadly enough there is no actual concert footage, as some would have been nice. The provided graphics that accompany these tunes are 'okay' at best. This newly re-packaged release of 'Space Ritual' would do more for a fan that's never had this record on CD, or perhaps a new Hawkfan {do many even exist?}. I would hope so. Mainly aimed toward the extreme die-hard collectors.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|I kept hearing the hype and gave it a spin.  I didn't get it.  So, I gave it another and another.  I even went to see them live so that maybe I would \\"get it.\\"  Nope.  They have some really good songs, and are good live performers, but they are just a really really OK indie band.  I'm a huge fan of Neutral Milk Hotel, Decemberists, Shins all of whom they've been compared to.  But this is just not greatness.  Pitchfork has created a monster.
1596680199|5.0|This is one of the finest \\"how-to\\" books that I have ever owned and/or read. The instructions are clear and self explanatory. The scope is broad and illuminating. The illustrations are so good they could almost stand alone. I highly reccommend this book to anyone interested in learning to make their own polymer clay beads.
B00000JQFL|5.0|I've been looking for this CD for about a few months I use to have the album. I'm showing my age but what a age to live in the wonderful 70'd. I blast this classic cd and you should hear it with the bose system wow. Love the E.W.F. a true fan and looking for that sound once again.
B00006I53S|5.0|This lens is smooth.  It offers me so many new photo ops that I never had before.  The IS (image stabilization) is a charm.  You shouldn't use it with a tripod, but for the most part it does not blur the picture if you did. (Sometimes the sensor that is trying to constantly focus will move and blur the image when on a tripod. Its best to just flip the switch off and this will not be an issue when shooting) It performs well in low light, both indoors and out, and really enables you to get those shots at dawn/dusk that you otherwise wouldn't stand a chance at getting.    An external flash will also give you extra options for shots, but if you are saving money in the short term, this lens will get those low light shots without needing to purchase an external flash as well.  Keep in mind the (IS) won't make every shot crisp in low light, but between using that and a tripod, you'll always be able to get that shot, regardless of light.    I've had my lens for 2 months, and I've already impressed more friends and family than ever expected.  Common questions and comments you'll get include \\"how were you able to get that shot\\", \\"that looks like something a professional would take\\" and \\"you really know what you're doing\\".  Of course, even the nicest camera and lens cannot make you a better photographer, it only gives you the tools to do more with your creativity.      Aside from having an on/off switch for the IS, you can also turn on/off the manual focus, so that if you aren't ready to take full control, you don't have to.     The weight of the lens balances well with a battery grip added to the body.  (The battery grip is optional, I got mine through Opteka, and its a great addition for longer battery life and offsetting heavy lens weight.)  The overall range that it shoots makes it ideal for your every day lens.  With a 1.6x factor on an XT/XTi, you're actually shooting 44-216mm.  This will allow you to take your standard shots, get some great portrait photos of friends/families for those special occasions (including weddings), and also give you enough zoom to impress even yourself with the shot potential you will have available... until you find the need or the money to get that telephoto lens.  The macro setting also impressed me.  It performs surprisingly well, and will leave you smiling day after day. It is not a true macro, but will certainly zoom in within an inch of the subject.  The lens has just enough to satisfy both your zooming and macro needs, so you don't have to spend bundles of money on various lenses until you're ready to get serious.  The example photos illustrate both of these features remarkably well.    This is a great purchase if you aren't able to jump to the L series of glass, and I'd strongly recommend considering this as your optimal walk around lens.
B00005JOHC|5.0|Does anyone else Sense EDITING of the Episodes in this Season 1 Collection??    I have watched Episodes 1-10 so far and One of them is 18 1/2 Minutes long??    What's The Deal?
0195073401|5.0|This is not only a text book but also a very sourceful handbook of microeconomics. It is worth owning all your lifetime. Even one day when, we are old, we at least could see all we knew about the microeconomic world at that time.
0671015206|4.0|Everyone should read this book. If you want to be a millionaire, see how millionaires act.
B00006I53S|5.0|This isn't so much about the lens because it does what it is supposed to do, but more about the seller.  This was a VERY fast turn around for delivery, and the pricing was better than at Dell or Canon directly.  So thank you for the great saving.  As for the lens its self, it is a slightly wider lens than a standard lens but it is VERY fast on the AF and is a fantastic choice when it come to being used as my base lens.
075640407X|5.0|This book was masterfully written. I had thought about buying it for a while and then one day I finally did. It was one of the best decisions I have made regarding books. This book makes you feel the emotions that are being portrayed in the chapters. When a book can do that, it is truly a great piece of work! Get off your computer and buy it now!!!
B000002GK1|5.0|When you heard the name, you were intrigued.  Even if you didn't like rock music, your were curious.  When you heard one of their songs (and it was probably \\"Outshined\\") you either loved it or hated it.  If you loved it, you bought this album.  You went home to play it.  If you rated the album as a whole, you either loved it or hated it.  Chances are, a few years later, you go to a friends house.  This certain friend was one that hated SOUNDGARDEN once she/he heard \\"Outshined\\" and there's one dude there that bought this album and lost all faith once he heard the recording from front to back.  All of a sudden they ask you, \\"Did you buy the new SOUNDGARDEN?\\"<br />\\"Hell yeah,\\" you say.<br />\\"That album rules!\\" they say.<br />This is where SOUNDGARDEN became the amazing band that they were.  This is where all of 'SUPERUNKNOWN' came from.  This is the beginning of the end.  This is the beginning of the Ben Shepard days.  If you hated this album before 'SUPERUNKNOWN' came out, chances are, you love it now.  \\"Mind Riot\\" is one of the most underrated songs of all time.  From front to back, this album is genius.<br />I have nothing against Terry Date.  He's produced some great recordings (SMASHING PUMPKINS, PANTERA).  But, if only Benden 'O Brien produced this gem.  What if???
0143038583|5.0|I bought The Omnivore's Dilemma for a college English course. I'm not sure what I expected, but the result was intriguing. The book offers a detailed look into what exactly we are eating, and I really enjoyed it.    This is a book that I am likely to share with others because it relates to just about everyone and makes you think about the choices our society has made.
B000TUXL2A|4.0|Well, still going thru it and as usual coming to appreciate it more with every listen.  Punish the Monkey and Let It All Go have really caught my ear and imagination.  Mark's been my favorite musician since Sultans. People ask me why I pretty much just recycle his stuff and listen to it almost exclusively.  Well, I'm spoiled because after you've listened, really listened, most everything else can't hold up and is second rate. Those who don't get it never will, and just put their \\"Bringing Sexy Back\\" CD in. I can't understand how he comes up with some of the stuff he writes about and I have never heard another musician who can make me imagine characters and scenes that go with his music.  I recall one reviewer of the On Every Street tour I went to refer to it as \\"Musical Mindscaping\\".  Love the music, but I must admit, I do miss some of the uptempo stuff like Why Aye man or What It Is, but the lack of it will never stop me from buying and listening.  Someday he will pass on as a largely unappreciated musical genius.  Hopefully not for another 30 years at least......
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|We have viewed Serenity 3 times since purchasing the dvd and are about to enjoy our 4th viewing this weekend. While it is not necessary to have viewed the series of 14 tv eposides prior to enjoying Serenity, it might make the experience richer for you. Serenity, including the companion (no pun intended) Firefly series, is pure art. From the incredible story set 500 years in the future, to the 9 strong characters and their mingled development, to the visuals & absolutely beautiful music, you will not be disappointed. In fact, the movie might change your life a bit. You'll also enjoy the 10th character, Serenity herself - the lovable space ship that will make you feel quite at home 500 years in the future.
0375805613|5.0|Both my husband and I loved this book as children, and now our son does too!  It drags the child into the action of the story, and they love doing what Grover asks them not to.  I have not yet met the child who didn't enjoy it.
0694003611|5.0|I first had this book read to me at a public library when I was 4.  I never owned it growing up, but I would borrow it and force my parents to read it to me.  I bought this book for my dear friend who is about to give birth as I write this for her little one.  I think it is an integral part of the bedtime routine and it can be fun to have your child say goodnight to their room as well.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Entertaining, educational, and a great value.  The zoom in and zoom out of various terrains, climates, flora, and fauna is awe inspiring.  The 1080p resolution fully demonstrates the capabilities of an HD television and BluRay player.  The symbiotic relationships in nature displayed in this series as well as how life can thrive in the harshest environments makes one pause, appreciate, and wonder.
0920668372|5.0|This book is has impacted me in such a way, and from such an early age, that it will resonate forever.  It is only a sad book if you don't know how to celebrate the life of a loved one.  I think it's good for children to question the lessons of this book.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|I read this many years ago and saved the info, but forgot the source. Paul was quoted as saying that he wanted the tracks to go:    3-6-4-7-8-1-2-9-5-10    but the record label wouldn't go with that and made it as we now know it.    Try that line-up and see how you like it.
B00003CXA6|5.0|What (combined with my reading) seems an unbiased and realistic narrative of the battle. The cast is superb (Jeff Daniels in particular) and the cinematography is excellent. This is now quite an old production, and in fact I bought it to replace my VHS copy which had started to suffer. My only complaint with the movie is the characterisation of the British Guards officer as a mildly dim upper-class twit (English term, but you get the message!) Well worth buying
B000KJU1HI|5.0|As usual Bob Dylan shines.  The creativity of the young Dylan still is amazing to this day.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Let me keep this brief.<br /><br />Yesterday, I loaded this album onto my Itunes and played one track after the other, never skipping or fast forwarding. It was the best 26 minutes I've spent on anything of late.<br /><br />For the record, I have not seen this movie, and got this solely because I am a fan of Pearl Jam. However, this is as un-Pearl Jam as you're going to get, since Eddie went in for a more acoustic sound here. At its' worst (on two tracks) this reminded me of Chris Cornell's new CD (not entirely a bad thing). At its' best, it was reminiscent of some of Eddie's best work with other artists (such as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan). His lower range and his whisper work to particular effect, bringing to mind my favorite male singer - Jeff Buckley.<br /><br />Its the Jeff Buckley connection that is especially striking on this record. I have strong feeling Eddie listened to \\"Grace\\" and \\"Live at Sin E\\" before recording this as the similarities are too startling not to notice.<br /><br />Finally a male solo album by a rock artist that is actually deserving of your money, respect and replay value. Yes, its short and clocks in less than a half hour, but this is better than all the other pointless 'rock' albums cluttering charts right now. Listen to this piece of art, and then wonder you even bothered buying that Nickelback album.<br /><br />Five Stars for Eddie Vedder. Some things get better with age.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|These discs are showing wonders of our world, so beautiful that it made me want to go and see for myself.  If you have a top home cinema equippment, you will be able with these images to fine tune further more your settings. There is less than 0.5 % of SD in the discs.  I agree that this is the perfect demo for a full HD 1080P screen or projector.  A better-than-theater experience.
B000000HZT|5.0|I bought the LP a long time ago and wore deeper grooves in it for all the times I played it. The atmosphere created by Tony Bank's composition style, weaving keyboards/synths, and intelligent lyrics always takes me to another place. I don't get to play my LPs much anymore and picked up the CD version. Once I played it, the wonderful feelings all came back and I appreciated the creativity and musicianship even more now. I strongly recommend this album for anyone with a hunger for something different and inspiring.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Just a quick comment for those who felt the actors were \\"too subtle\\" or not expressive enough: British society, especially at that time, demanded exactly the type of subtlety portrayed. There were things one simply did not speak aloud; decorum and restraint were the rule. I felt the actors rose extremely well to the challenge: their gestures, expressions, and tone conveyed effectively the meanings the characters couldn't say outright, given their time and place.    A particular treat was seeing how the dialogue allowed both Anne and Captain Wentworth communicate their feelings \\"between the lines\\": Captain Wentworth speaking of Captain Benwick and Phoebe, says, \\"A man does not recover from such a devotion to such a woman...\\" and *clearly* he wants Anne to understand that he is describing his own feelings for her. Similarly, Anne sends a message to Captain Wentworth when she speaks with Captain Harville by the window: \\"It would not be in the nature of any woman who truly loved...\\"
B000002GEY|5.0|So glad I got  this album on CD. I enjoyed it on 33 1/3 when it 1st came out. This is classic rock!
0765316889|5.0|My golly-gosh this was a great book to read! highly enjoyable and meaty, I challenge anyone who knocked down harry potter in a day to try the same with this one! it's impossible, it's one of the amazing book where you are torn between going slow and savouring said meaty juices of enjoyment (and oh... oh I love the kandra so...) and staying up till it's morning again churning through it.    Not disappointing!
B00000JTB2|5.0|\\"In Session by Albert King, Stevie Ray Vaughn\\" is a beautiful compilation of some of the best blues songs sung and performed by two of the masters of blues.  Nissan recently featured the song 'Pride and Joy' for their 2008 model rollout, and my wife instantly knew the song and the artists because we had been playing this album at home for the prior month.  SVR is credited with the rebirth of the blues in the 1980's and still hitting strong licks on this album produced in 1999.  A definitive album for both Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughn, you will know most of the songs even if you did not know who played them.  This is the only album you need to explain the blues to your ignorant friends!
B000UR366S|3.0|So it's been 9 years since \\"Taming The Tiger\\", Joni Mitchell's last original album. I felt \\"Taming The Tiger\\" was weak compared to the excellent \\"Turbulent Indigo\\" or even \\"Night Ride Home\\". You would think after 9 years that \\"Shine\\" would re-establish Joni Mitchell as a force to reckon with. After all, the agenda this time is socio-political, much like her best work \\"Ladies Of The Canyon\\". But, no. \\"Shine\\" is second rate Joni. While the lyrics may be well written, and her views sharpened and honed, the music is definitely sub-par.<br /><br />\\"One Week Last Summer\\" is a five minute instrumental played on what sounds like a synthesizer. Why not only use a piano? Instead Mitchell plays all the instruments through a synthesizer. The song is just okay.<br /><br />\\"This Place\\" and \\"If I Had A Heart\\". Both tracks did not stand out for me after repeated listening.<br /><br />\\"Hana\\" is more experimental for Joni with its drum machine rhythm, the melody stuck in my mind, so it's one of the better tracks, but still nothing to shout about.<br /><br />\\"Bad Dreams\\" is a good song with a somber melody.<br /><br />Why an updated version of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\"? Thematically it fits with the rest of the songs, and after all Mitchell predicted 37 years ago that we'd be in this same predicament. The updated version doesn't really add anything great to the original though.<br /><br />\\"Night Of The Iguana\\" is one of the better tracks on the cd.<br /><br />\\"Strong And Wrong\\", \\"Shine\\" and \\"If\\" are all okay.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Shine\\" is that if Mitchell wanted to say something powerful she should have spent more time on the music. As far as I am concerned, the lyrics are good, but utterly forgettable due to the lack of song craft. I am a long time Mitchell fan, but I'd rather go and listen to \\"Ladies Of The Canyon\\", \\"Blue\\" or even \\"Turbulent Indigo\\" instead. So, three stars for a warmed over album.
0765348276|5.0|Wow!  I was blow away by this one.  Mr. Scalzi obviously learned a few things from Heinlein's books, actually more in my opinion.  Old Man's War opens in very fresh and direct way.  Similar to Mr. Heinlein's [[ASIN:0441783589 Starship Troopers]], Mr. Scalzi main character (John Perry) tells us his story of joining the military and being trained and fighting, however this time our recruit is lived for 75 years.  Instead of being shocked by his trainers and asking questions about why he joined and if it's right to fight, Mr. Scalzi twists things a bit and has 75 year old people joining the Colonial Defense Forces (CDF) to protect Earth's frontiers in exchange for a chance to have a 2nd life.  Mr. Scalzi's concept of people with previous experience being of value to a military is interesting, equally interesting is his concept for Ghost Brigades (you need to read it to find out about them).  All I'll say is that it's a great counterpoint to using 75 year olds as your infantry.<br /><br />Rating wise this is an easy one, 5 stars.  The characters are quick, crisp, and the descriptions are some of the best ones I've read.  The front half of the book reminded me of Heinlein, while the back half had me thinking about [[ASIN:0060510862 The Forever War]].  My one dislike in the book is that when he's talking about Earth, things are very 1990/2000'ish.  I'd preferred it if Mr. Scalzi had shown Earth more advanced than that, but it does make for a great counterpoint to the colonialization of space.  Bottom line, read and enjoy!
B000000OF6|5.0|You get a lot of bang for your buck here.  However, there are still some tracks you might want that aren't on here.  Noticeably missing (for me, at least) was \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\", which I would have expected on a GH for Queen.  But all-in-all a good deal.
B0000009RX|5.0|Great album.  Can't say its my favorite Zappa album, but its still very good.
B00006V9A0|4.0|If Nirvana was and/or still is your choice in music there is also this compilation with one previously unreleased track to have. My rating is 4 stars only because the tracks on this album are already known to Nirvana audience and were published on the previous albums. \\"You know you're right\\" is the only one that wasn't here before this album has happened and the one that was recorded in 1994 as one of the Kurt's last songs. Perhaps the last one that matters at all to most Nirvana fans. There is also a nice video for this great song. Other songs are mostly the greatest hits and singles like \\"Smells like teen spirit\\", \\"In bloom\\", \\"Come as you are\\", \\"Lithium\\" and others from In Utero, Bleach, MTV Unplugged in New York... If you like Nirvana too much and if you care, then you will probably buy this item. Add to shopping cart... Proceed to check out...
B000059GEH|5.0|In this movie all the characters talk with smart, witty dialogue but it is the women that steal the show. Marilyn Monroe is at her ditsiest with a severe vision problem that she won't correct by wearing her glasses. Betty Grable is sweet but a little too slick for her own good. And Lauren Bacall is shiny, sassy, and just as smart as always. All the ladies are looking for love but their only criteria is that the man must have money. The usual mayhem ensues with some notable performances by the ladies. My favorite is the scene where Betty is coming back with her friend from the mountains and he is trying to cover up the fact that he is not with his wife by taking a different route. They go over the bridge and well . . . watch how Betty makes the evening edition with a man trying desperately to hide. Marilyn picks a tricky guy trying to take advantage of her while the man she ultimately falls for David Wayne tries to figure out how someone else is living in his apartment. William Powell from Thin Man fame has a role as the suitor that Lauren Bacall is interested in. Both of them know that this is all about the money but Mr. Powell plays the gentlemen with great care even when it costs him what he wants. Funny movie with lots of sly, quick jabs and some scenes that are so well crafted that you remember them long after the movie ends.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I have loved this CD ever since I heard it for the 1st time this summer on a trip out west driving through Utah. On our return my 19 year old son gave it to me for my birthday in August and I have played it in my car exclusively. Believe me, I have listened to a lot (!) of music in my life and music is definitely a vital part of it but haven't felt so mesmerized for years, literally. The sound, the lyrics, the way it rings in my ears, etc., you just have to listen to this - it'll sing to your soul. (VW must have felt it too since I noticed now that those are Wilco songs in their ads.) I guess now I'll have to branch out and do a study of Wilco, that is, if I can ever stop playing this one CD!
0143038419|4.0|I've not read any of Gilbert's other works, but overall, I enjoyed this one. Her wit, humor, candor, willingness to acknowledge her faults, and terrific way with words kept me interested pretty much throughout. My attention did wane a bit through some of the in-depth descriptions of her meditative states. However, welcome doses of comic relief (Richard from Texas is a hoot!) got me back on track.  And, oh yes...a perk is that I did learn quite a few things about Italy, ashrams, and Bali--albeit from a tourist's perspective.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I bought this widescreen DVD for my wife, who absolutely loves this movie. She has watched it on VHS many, many times, and knows almost every scene by heart. I looked forward to watching it with her on our home theater system consisting of a hi-def front projector displaying on a 96\\" diagonal screen, and a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround system using a Denon receiver and Definitive Tech speakers (BP2002 towers, CLR2002 center, BP2X surrounds and PF15 sub). Anyway, the audio quality is outstanding, as was expected. The music is a highlight of this film and I enjoy it immensely. However, my wife commented that the top and bottom of the image was cut off. I told her that this widescreen image was simply wider and she was mistaken, but she insisted that she was right, so she popped in her VHS tape and we compared identical scenes, and surprisingly, she was right. In one scene, the father is sitting in a chair and you could see his hands folded in his lap. In the DVD version, you can not see his hands at all. A minor detail for sure, but my wife says that she likes her version better. Oh well, I'm hoping that the hi-def version scheduled to be released in November will have the entire picture without any cropping. Other than that, I can recommend this movie as a lush, well told love story.
B000000OTU|4.0|This album is full of Aerosmith's greatest hits of the late 80's and 90's but it is missing a lot of the best songs from albums as well.  I would of gotten rid of Cryin', Crazy, What it Takes for starters.  The album already has Amazing and Angel what other power ballads do you need?  You certainly don't need 5 slow songs in a row.  The album could of used    Magic touch  Young Lust   F.I.N.E*    to give it a boost Just to name a few.  The album is worth the money, and if you are a fan you probably already own it along with 5 or 10 of their albums.  The first Greatest Hits album is better, if you are just getting into Aerosmith I recommend buying the first Greatest hits album and Gems, to give you a feel of how great this band is.  Then buy this album and explore the back catalog for yourself.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|Animation-phenomenal, Music-mind blowing, Story-interesting, Characters- compelling, Sound quality -excellent.  Fans of Le Parkour are gonna love this one.  I personally saw this film as a giant leap in Anime.  It has unbelievable action and yet it remains a very human story.  It is emotional yet gritty and tough.  I enjoyed the characters White (Shiro) and Black (Karo) and their duality.  It was a modern tale of taoist wizardry with a street edge that is rarely seen in this type of feature.  The backrounds are a primary character as well.  I have never seen such attention to detail in any amimation period.  Worth every penny.
B000R4SMCW|2.0|Let me begin by saying Hopkins is fantastic as always, he is the only reason to see this film, that and the spectacular house he resides in.  This movie starts off very good, the begining is stylish and sort of film  noir, but then Gosling arrives, with his faux Okie drawl and his nausiating arrogance, look i realize his character is suppose to be a ruthless hot shot, but Gosling reveals neither charisma nor charm, Matt Damon or Decaprio, as well as a host of other actors could have done so much with this role; and the force love triangle with Gosling and this female lawyer is so forced, you have no idea why she is so hot for him and they have zero chemistry.  Gosling character supposedly finds his so called heart near the end and i just did not buy it, i mean this selfish jerk sitting by the vigile by the beside of the victem seemed so out of character for this guy, frankly i was rooting for the charismatic Hopkins the entire movie, and he was a cold sociopath, i just disliked Gosling that much.  Only recommended for the stylish sets, Hopkins and his architectural digest house...if you must see this movie, rent it..dont buy it.
B000SZLSB2|1.0|James Blunt is a very nice man.  His first record was simply beyond words.  However, this one should be called,\\"All the Lost Money.\\" The CD case is worth more than the CD inside.  It is a lot of whine and it all sounds the same.  I am sad for James because I just know this is not his best by a long shot.  There has to be a better CD than this inside this man's heart/mind.  Do yourself a favor and give the money you would have spent on this CD to a cause that you like.  Church,temple, etc.  Perhaps James will favor us with another CD that is worthy of his name and your hard earned money. This ain't the one folks.  This is a waste of your time.
B000J103YI|5.0|Jennifer Hudson's booming voice makes it worth the price of the CD. If you saw the movie listening to the CD is almost like reliving the movie.
B000RMQH30|4.0|Ben Harper is one of the few surviving \\"traditionalists\\" in todays musical landscape. Even though Harper is a child of the eighties and nineties his music has always been a throwback to the decades before that. Harper has throughout his career shown a high esteem for the Blues and Soul men of the past. The homages to the likes of Robert Johnson and Otis Redding were often well visible on the surface. Not only on his own records but also in the collaborations he has chosen. In the past Harper appeared on the Funk Brothers documentary about Motown's house band and recorded with the Blind Boys of Alabama.    His love of music history and his social awareness has caused his passed records to be somewhat too solemn and serious from time to time. What's so refreshing about this album is that Harper for maybe the first time is his career manages to sound loose and carefree while creating haunting Blues and Soul music on the side. For those who already knew Ben Harper and his work there will be nothing new under the sun, he still does what he's good at. He just never sounded as effortlessly doing it. For those yet to be introduced to his work this is an excellent starting point. Life line is one of those records you'd warmly recommend to anyone who enjoys acoustic and Soulful music. With the coming fall Lifeline feels like a cool summer breeze.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie sat on my desk for over a month before I watched it. After I watched it I wanted to severely punish myself for waiting so long to see it. This movie, aside from 300, is my favorite of this year. It's amazing to me how the lives of an entire family can be wrapped into an hour and a half of disc time.   If you ever find yourself in a bad mood, \\"wondering what else could possibly happen\\" you have to watch this movie. I have introduced it to all of my friends and they all loved it. This movie is a suprise. How could so much drama happen to one family? I don't want to give away the ending but Rick James works his way into the movie. Granpa truly gave her the gift that keeps on giving. I've watched it a million times.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I was please with the service. The DVD  arrived in a timely fashion and the movie was great.
0060763892|5.0|The elite scientific military team Sigma Force tackles a dangerous mystery involving a seemingly incurable pandemic with centuries-old ties that seems capable of turning all of nature against humankind, and to stop the threat, they are forced to recruit the assistance of an untrustworthy adversary.<br />This Indiana Jones type adventure was a blast to read. Exciting from start to finish. Rollins ability to write these types of novels does not seem to be waning. Bringing the past to the future and mixing science with history usually always makes for enthralling reading. Keep up the good work James Rollins.<br /><br />From inside: \\"...Scientists have even coined a name for these Ancient strain of viruses, one that turns friend to foe: 'The Judas Strain' its capability of turning all bacteria into killers\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B000RC2EH8|4.0|This is a movie for the whole family, and it looks great in HD.  The story line is pretty well written and you get to see Leonardo and Raphael go one on one.  The movie has plenty of action and the martial arts are choreographed very well for a cg movie, if you enjoyed the real turtle movies then you'll enjoy this one.
006441034X|5.0|Diana Wynne Jones is an amazing story teller. You will absolutely fall in love with her characters in this wonderful world of magic and wizards. If you saw Hayao Miyazaki's animated interpertation of this story, you will love the book just as much. Possibly more!
0201721481|5.0|This book is great!! I had learnt C++ way back in 2000. I have been hearing about the drastic changes in C++ and hence bought this book. It really taught me a lot. This coupled with Scott Meyers make a killer C++ combination.
0743486285|5.0|I got this book with mixed emotions. I wasnt sure I wanted to read about his life on drugs and alcohol ect.. When I got it I in turn became addicted..to the book! It was sad,gross,and sometimes funny. I am amazed that he is still alive, happy that he is and glad that he is clean. This book should be a requirement to read in high school,this book could help alot of people, maybe change somebody's life.
B000UFAURI|4.0|I agree with most things that people have been saying in their reviews, so I won't make too many general comments. I WILL say that I was a little disappointed after the first listen, but every time I listen to it again I love it more and more. There's definitely something for everyone, but in my opinion you have to be a little more mature and patient to get everything out of this album.    One of the things I appreciate most is that all of the \\"filler\\" songs have something redeeming about them, something that makes you think twice about skipping them. A few of the songs start out slow, and then out of nowhere come flying riffs that rock as hard as anything they've ever done, especially in the end of Come Alive and the chorus of Long Road to Ruin. The lyrics are indeed a little lackluster throughout, but the writing of the music itself is by far the best they have done, granting that these songs aren't as instantly catchy as those in The Colour and the Shape (my fave) or, to a somewhat lesser extent, There is Nothing Left to Lose.    Some people are judging the instrumental song a bit too harshly, I fear. It's really fun to listen to Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners after being a big fan of Jimmy Page's White Summer. The Foo Fighters manage to resurrect Led Zeppelin in their own style for a few moments in this acoustic instrumental duet, and I can see why it might not seem that interesting if you haven't heard White Summer. But there's an especially good version of that song on the double Led Zeppelin DVD if you can get access to that, as it's even better when you can see him play. Do your homework, then come back and tell me you still don't like Ballad ;)    Also judging from the other reviews, I'm surprised that more people haven't connected with Statues. While it's definitely not a traditional Foo song and it may be hard to find a lot of radio play for this guy, I think it's one of top two or three songs on the album. The sweet electric, the Ben Folds-esque piano, Dave's trademark voice on some simple but powerful lyrics, all come together here. Once it hits the 2:00 mark, you can't help but get caught up in it.    To stress what a few others have noted, what you have here is a complete album, a concept that is lost on many bands nowadays. And not only are the changes between songs significant, but the changes within the songs themselves are also very important. I kept finding myself wishing more internal evolution on a lot of the songs on In Your Honor, but there Dave stuck to his guns too often, which usually wasn't that effective (esp. on the slow disc). Here, we find that with few exceptions, the songs are carefully crafted to be more than just different verses with the same chorus, which is mostly what you hear on the radio these days, and I think it really pays off.    Dave said that they were out to create an album that would shake things up, involving funky time signature changes and blending musical influences. I heard a radio interview where he likened it achieving something like Steely Dan. While I would not say that they stepped THAT far outside the sandbox here, I think that they did so in some important ways, and I think fans should buy the album and see for themselves.      My favorites: Pretender, Long Road to Ruin, Stranger Things Have Happened, Summer's End, Statues
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|When I first heard they were coming out with another DVD for Serenity, I was mad. Double dipping with DVDs is just not a cool aspect of capitalism. Anyway, my brother is obsessed with this movie, so I got this special edition, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has everything from the first DVD release, plus a new commentary with the actors and Joss, as well as lots of new featurettes! This is worth it, but I wish they would have told us before we got the first edition!
B0007XT87G|5.0|I have become a recent convert to Porcupine Tree.  A musician friend turned me on to them a couple years ago and sent me the In Absentia cd.  Always have been a big prog guy (King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Gentle giant etc) and discovered Spocks beard, Flower Kings and other more recent prog bands within the last 10 yrs.   Porcupine Tree is a band that has a totally unique sound and truly gifted song writing.  If you like bands that stand on their own such as early Genesis and King Crimson you should appreciate this.  Their music can be somewhat dark and moody and then shift to the most beautiful melody you've ever heard.  Kind of a signature thing with them.  Gives you the shivers!!  Check them out.  One of the true innovaters in modern music!
B0000009SF|5.0|Three great Zappa jazz-fusion albums, Waka/Jawaka, Hot Rats and Grand Wazoo. The latter is the best of the three. All three are must-haves if you want to explore Zappa. Another must-have is Jazz From Hell but it's a challenging listen! There's one more must-have. Apostrophe is one of those rare instances where pop meets superb composing and musicianship. Much of Zappa material became silly anti-establishment expoitation and goofyness. Some of it became very popular and FZ made a fortune from it. More power to him I say!!
B00005JPWH|3.0|I didn't love \\"Into the Wild\\", Sean Penn's new film based on the bestseller by Jon Krakauer.<br /><br />Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduates from Emory College, barely able to tolerate his parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) attendance at lunch after the graduation. Eating with his parents and his sister (Jena Malone), he rebuffs their offer of a new car. What does he need a new car for? What does he need material possessions for? Chris embarks on a road trip, using the car to get as far West as possible. When it finally breaks down, he cuts up all of his ID, his credit card, and his driver's license and burns his cash and sets out on foot. His goal is to make it to Alaska and camp and commune with nature. He doesn't tell his parents where he is going, because they would surely send out people to track him down, so he gets a good months head start before they even realize he is gone. Along the way, he meets a couple of hippies (Catherine Keener an d newcomer Brian Dierker), a boss who becomes a friend (Vince Vaughn) and an elderly man who is extremely lonely (Hal Holbrook). Each of these people will help him with wisdom and insight along the way to his ultimate destination. Alaska. There, he finds an abandoned bus and sets up camp within the shelter.<br /><br />\\"Into the Wild\\" is an interesting story, and will hold your interest, but the directing style is extremely obtrusive and the lead character is a little too selfish to be likable.<br /><br />Based on a true story, there is apparently some debate about whether Chris' journey is an act of selfishness or self-discovery. I can see both sides of this argument. But I have to lean towards selfish. It is understandable, and identifiable, that he wants to get away from his parents. I think all people have had these feelings at least once in their life. And from our brief moments with his parents and some things we learn later, these feelings are understandable. But when Chris leaves, and doesn't communicate with his family, he also doesn't communicate with his sister. Throughout the film, we hear the sister provide voice over explaining what a close bond she and Chris share, how they coped with their parents, etc. Why wouldn't he call his sister at some point? The film is about his journey to Alaska, but he doesn't spend the entire film in Alaska. He is often near or has access to a phone. If he has such a close bond with his sister, it doesn't make sense that he would never call her, never send her a letter, never try to contact her and let her know he is all right.<br /><br />Penn has apparently wanted to make this film for a number of years. He only held off because he was waiting for the approval of the McCandless family. He finally got their approval and then made the film. The story is ripe with dramatic potential. A young man makes a journey of self-discovery, trying to fulfill his dream of living in the wilderness. But this dramatic potential is robbed, in many cases, because Penn uses a number of editing techniques and storytelling devices, which do nothing more than reinforce the feeling we are watching a film. Every time the actors start to approach anything near what the film should be, Penn splits the screen into a number of pictures, all showing Emile Hirsch as McCandless, and we immediately snap back to reality and realize \\"Hey, we're watching a film.\\" Split screens (think TV's \\"24\\"), slow motion photography and other camera tricks all serve to draw the viewer out of what should be a small, intimate portrait of a young man`s journey.<br /><br />I read an article about Eddie Vedder's contributions to the film. Penn asked him to write some music and liked it so much, he asked him to write more, and they put a number of songs in the film. These moments are meant to be more background music, to give a little texture to this film portrait of McCandless' life but they also detract from the young man's journey. Most of the songs are simply Vedder humming, ormaking a tune with his deep voice. Very few actually have words. So it just seems a little odd to hear these strange sounds, as we watch the journey of a young man traveling through the wilderness.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch does a very good job. \\"Wild\\" is about his character's journey, and he is on screen for the majority of the film, so it is essential that we feel what he feels. If we don't feel the joy, the peace, the danger and the fright he feels, we have nothing to identify with. In a film of this nature, there are no other characters in a majority of the film, so if we don't identify with Chris, we have nothing to help us enter the story, no one to take us on the journey.<br /><br />I liked Hirsch's performance. Hirsch is turning into a very strong actor. He and Justin Timberlake were the standouts in the underrated \\"Alpha Dog\\" and has appeared in a number of other little seen films and had roles in television shows. In \\"Into the Wild\\" Hirsch brings a maturity to the role hinting at some of the performances he will deliver, some of the roles in his future.<br /><br />There are three pit stops in his journey. He first meets Jan (Catherine Keener) and her partner Rainey (Brian Dierker), two hippies who live in a camper and like to set up stakes with a community of like minded individuals in the desert. They earn a few dollars here and there, mosey along the road, and meet new people. In their discussions, they talk about Jan's son, whom she hasn't seen for a long time. This is a nice compliment to Chris' journey. Jan's comments have to make Chris think about the effect he is having on his own parents. Keener, as always, does a great job with her relatively small role. Brian Dierker is also very good. He realizes the emotional troubles his partner has, and seems to love her all the more for them.<br /><br />Then Chris meets Wayne (Vince Vaughn). Wayne is a bit of a wild guy, and he has a business of his own, so he hires Chris. They get along and work well together and form a friendship. Throughout the film, we see a letter or two Chris writes to Wayne, the letters writing out on the screen in bright big letters (remember the comment about Penn's directing style earlier? Yet another example.) When we eventually meet Wayne and see the bond they form, these letters make sense.<br /><br />At the bar one night, as Chris is relating his reasons for making this journey, Wayne realizes Chris has a fire in his spirit, much like he does. But he also realizes Chris has to tame this fire, or it could lead to bad things. He provides some useful advice.<br /><br />Finally, Chris meets Ron (Hal Holbrook). Ron is an elderly man, who lives alone and offers to let Chris stay with him for a while. Ron and Chris form a friendship as well and when Chris is finally ready to move on, there is a touching moment when Chris and Ron have to say goodbye to one another.<br /><br />These three pit stops are meant to illustrate a different aspect of Chris' life or behavior. Yet, he doesn't seem to learn from them. Because he doesn't learn anything from them, what is the point of sitting through them?<br /><br />As Chris begins his journey, he decides to change his name to Alex Supertramp. Not sure why. When I initially saw this information in the trailer and put this together with the car he owns, I suspected the film was set in the late `60s or early `70s. Why would a kid in the `80s and `90s come up with an idea like this? Not sure, because we never really see or hear any reasoning behind this. He must just be one of those people who would probably be more comfortable in a different era.<br /><br />\\"Into the Wild\\" is interesting, and contains some interesting, moving performances, but it doesn't do a good job of portraying the journey of the main character.

B00005ASHM|5.0|With Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys (or rather, Brian Wilson with the rest of the Beach Boys in tow) pulled off one hell of a feat: the album is a pop masterpiece, a collection of little ditties that command the emotional impact and inherent grandeur of symphonies. The songs aren't performances so much as they are works of architecture, a series of sound constructions that are executed with an uncanny amount of artistic finesse. The album makes use of densely layered instrumentation, incorporating an endless array of horns, strings, keyboards, guitars, and percussion to create a set of lush, colorful soundscapes.  The thing is, the music never sounds pretentious or forced; In the hands of Wilson and his endless army of session musicians, these gorgeous musings sound like the natural outcome of songs like \\"California Girls\\" or \\"In My Room.\\" It's either genius or something very close to it.    And really, there isn't a bad song in the whole bunch: \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" is an absolutely glorious album opener, a sun-splashed rush of passion and yearning. Brian's (and Mike Love's) vocals are stunning in their emotional directness. \\"God Only Knows\\" is quieter, but no less poignant- its dizzying swirls of percussion and dreamy vocal harmonies are just plain hypnotic. \\"Sloop John B\\" (a cover of a classic folk song) has some great harmonies and an infectious melody. \\"Let's Go Away For Awhile\\" and the title track are a couple of dizzyingly complex instrumentals that are among the dreamiest and most evocative works on the album. \\"You Still Believe In Me\\" is a stately, dreamy piece of chamber pop, while \\"I'm Waiting For The Day\\" is a wonderfully optimistic ballad. \\"That's Not Me,\\" \\"I Know There's An Answer,\\" and \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\" are fantastic evocations of youthful alienation and angst, while \\"Here Today\\" and \\"Caroline No\\" are equally effective portraits of lost innocence and love gone sour. There's also \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder),\\" one of the most achingly beautiful ballads ever created. The chorus will make your heart melt.    So...yeah. Good stuff. Pick it up.

1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns, contrary to what others anticipated (after reading The Kite Runner) is an EXCELLENT piece of writing. Hosseini captures the roles of women in Afghanistan from the '80's and the Soviet Invasion well past 911.  This is not only a history lesson, but a story about the realities of the world we live in; how different we are.  I would recommend anyone who enjoyed the Kite Runner to pick this one up--and, I guarantee you won't want to put it down until you've finished the book!

B00005JGAB|5.0|Some artists enter the recording studio for their first album in a sort of embryonic state; the subsequent debut disc usually bears little resemblance to the band they will later become. (I'm thinking of the likes of the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, even U2.)Then there are those bands that seem to have been born fully developed; the acts for which virtually every sound or type of song that they would ever produce was present on the first album. The Ramones are a textbook example of this phenomenon. Though they would change producers a whole bunch and would occasionally turn down the amps and add some backing keyboards, strings, vocals, etc. they would never really venture far from the blueprint of the three chord blasts of overdriven noise pop that made up their self-titled first album.     At a distance of more than thirty years from this release, it's hard to remember how utterly revolutionary this sounded back in 1976. Up to then, if you were using a distorted guitar in your rock, you were a Hard Rock/Heavy Metal act, or possibly an offshoot of this like Glam or Southern Rock, period. There was no \\"Punk Rock\\". You played plodding stuff at generally slow tempos. Fretboard prowess and extended lead guitar histrionics was a must; no self-respecting Rock act just slammed out power chords with no solos. Five to seven minute songs was the norm; two minutes was barely enough time to get through the first verse.      The Ramones came up with something no one had thought of -- a 60's AM radio sensibility (tuneful melodies, songs lasting less than three minutes, fast tempos) applied to simple songs about teenage, New York or just \\"I Wanna/I Don't Wanna\\" topics thrashed out over the din of the hard-edged wall of cranked Marshall amps (featuring Johnny Ramone's all-downstroke, barre-chorded Mosrite guitar in one channel and Dee Dee Ramone's \\"root of the chord only\\" bass work in the other.)  Though their approach was influenced by the likes of the Stooges, New York Dolls and even the Beach Boys, the Ramones created a strikingly original hybrid of sound and presentation. And they stuck with it. Even their earliest demos sound pretty much the same as the album...any of their albums.      The wall of sound created by these four Forest Hills, Queens natives was like white noise from some distant galaxy to most ears in that Bicentennial year. It didn't seem to have originated on the same planet as \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" or \\"Rumours\\", two of the biggest selling albums that were released within a year of this subversive little disc, which can be seen as the first shot in the battle against bloated corporate rock of the mid-70's. By the way, this album also predates every British punk album---the earliest, by the Damned, was released about 10 months after this. Given the Ramones live appearances in London in the summer of 1976, there is little doubt that the \\"brothers\\" from Queeens were a prime influence on British Punk.       This album still sounds fresh and exiting after nearly a third of a century. The entire Ramones album (14 songs in its initial incarnation--22 songs here with some bonus demos and mixes) takes almost a half an hour to hear but usually requires much longer to digest completely.  The first spin usually results in a puzzled look on the listener's face and questions like, \\"What's with that accent?\\" \\"Are there really only two lines of lyrics in that whole song?\\"  \\"Is it supposed to sound like this?\\" \\"Doesn't the word 'Basement' have two syllables?\\" \\"Is this a joke?\\"     Eventually though, most listeners get pulled in by the afore-mentioned wall of guitar sound driven by the propulsive beat provided by Tommy Ramone (it's amazing to focus on how gently he's actually hitting the drums to get those sounds--he is not a skin pounder of the Keith Moon/John Bonham school of rock drumming and stays away from elaborate fills or accents) and the Queens-by-way-of-a-phony-British-accent-sounding vocals of Joey, the tallest Ramone.Most listeners start to \\"get it\\" by the second or third listen, and once you're hooked, you realize how crafty the Ramones are to have come up with something that seems so dumb at first but sounds so brilliant in hindsight. Though they are serious about their art, don't overlook their sense of humor here. The \\"brothers\\" Ramone weren't going to crack their deadpan scowls to let you know about it, but let's face it: lines like \\"Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show, first stop, Havana Go Go\\" or \\"Texas Chainsaw Massa CREE, they took my baby away from me\\" are just plain funny.  Though occasionally touching on some disturbing subject matter such as male prostitution, Nazism or the misuse and abuse of power tools, model cement, sports equipment, girlfriends and children, the Ramones debut album is mostly just cartoon violence and fun, and is performed with a manic energy and wit that had been sorely missing from Rock music for many years prior to this release.      The Ramones consistency and stubborn resistance to evolution actually ended up working against them in the long run. What was startlingly new and different in the 70's  eventually caused them to be viewed as a conservative anachronism by the mid-90's as other bands developed and refined what they started. Upstarts who were in diapers or elementary school when this record was first released went on to eclipse their idols in record sales and popularity while using virtually the same sonic blueprint as the Ramones by the 1990's.(I'm talking about you,Green Day, Offspring, Rancid, etc.)      The Ramones disc is an impressive debut and though they produced several more fine albums over the next 20 years (the best ones are the ones released in the next few years from this one), the first album is nearly as good as it gets in the Ramones catalog. It is recommended highly for those with a love of loud, fast Rock-N-Roll. It's the kind of historical document that is also a heap of fun to listen to repeatedly. And it's great to hear what it sounds like when a full grown adult band with a snotty adolescent brain springs forth from the womb and assaults the planet with its own peculiar and influential brand of Rock-n-Roll.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|I enjoyed this album, focuses more on edgy guitar sounds than what the band is most-known for.  I do think this is worth the buy, but considering the wait, think they could've done better.
B00005JNEI|5.0|When I first saw Farenheight 9/11 I was amazed! I really like the way that the movie is produced and think all Patriots in the States should watch it.
0440238609|5.0|I first read His Dark Materials trilogy when I was in 7th grade and had to endure an entire year before the third one finally came out when I was in 8th grade.  They have remained my absolute favorite books throughout the last ten years, and I can't wait to see the movie in December.  :~)
B000OYC3J8|5.0|This album is just wild, and every track is a goldmine.  A collage of Celtic and Blues sounding tunes, Icky Thump will live up to its fans' expectations, and reach out to new ones such as myself.  My best friend loves The White Stripes, I never took the time to get into them myself until I was at a party and a few of the songs popped up on the playlist.  I immediately got the album and since then I have been digging in the group's past for other albums.
1416523359|3.0|There's a line on page 420 of the paperback version that goes, \\"...for once in your smucking life, you be short\\" and that line could apply to Mr. King. Like many of his books, this one is 200 (or 300) pages too long. We could have done with a lot less flashbacks about Scott and concentrated more on the drama of Lisey.  The editors who demanded King cut many pages out of \\"The Stand\\" had it right. (Although King later published the unabridged version). But King got too successful for later editors to overrule him. Too bad, the books (\\"IT\\" come to mind too) like bread, would have been better with some shortening.  But King does have the grand ability to create characters you (the reader) care about and the book (if you skip over the boring parts) is fun to read.  One of my favorite writers (now) is Philip Carraher, and his fantasy \\"The Necklace of Stones\\" is well worth reading if you're a King fan, and (in my opinion) much more crisply written. No boring parts in it.  I'm looking forward however to \\"Blaze\\" written by a younger King (under another name) before he began elongating his books. It will likely be a much shorter and faster (and so more exciting) read.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I observed this DVD with keen interest.  The facts revealed to back his argument are awesome.  The current crop of world leaders, who are mostly against his conclusions, are hiding their heads in coal and oil.  I trust that someday the occupants of the world will wake up and start to consider their living environment.
B000O178BY|5.0|This album is amazing.  I have been a fan of Trent Reznor since really Pretty Hate Machine, and just when I thought I had the man figured out...well Year Zero is a product of just that.  My friends who are quite a little bit more critical and picky when it comes to critiquing music, had to admit this may be one of his best albums in a long time.  I always liked this artist because of his ability to blend chaos and melody and have both elements coincide with one another.  This is not easy, Year Zero does exactly that with a fresh sound you may not be familiar with.  I know there were mixed reviews about With Teeth, the previous album does not compare.  I know all the NIN fans have had this one for quite sometime, but those of you who finally realized that Fall Out Boy and Justin Timberlake really aren't musicians, check this album out, you won't be disappointed.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Once again, just brilliant!  My favourite is an extra scene at the end of Two Towers where the trees smash the Orcs that fled into Farngorn Forest after Isengard was destroyed by the Ents. A bit of their own medicine!  Really a good movie!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is a great show. Michael C. Hall is a joy to watch. He makes you feel compassion for a character who shows no compassion for his victims. One of the best shows on television.
B000RMQH30|5.0|After 9 months of touring<br />BH and the Innocent Criminals went to a studio in Paris and recorded this new album in seven days! No computers used. Just straight up good music.<br /><br />This is one to enjoy for years to come. Let's hope this album finally secures BH as a master of his craft. He has been pumping it out since 1992 and is still rolling right along.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|There's something about `Zoolander' that just tickles every funny bone in my body.  Aside from one scene involving David Duchovny I swear this to be the perfect comedy.  The pairing of Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell is just brilliance, utter comedic brilliance.  Ben Stiller has never been so funny as he is in `Zoolander'.  Owen Wilson had a great year in 2001, with his performance in `Zoolander' as well as `The Royal Tenenbaums' he proved that he is comedic gold.  I personally was never sold on Wilson's bankability until I saw him here and realized he has the goods.  Don't get me started on Will Ferrell.  The man is as obnoxious as the day is long but I can't think of a comedian as funny or as entertaining.  As the evil Mugatu, Ferrell completely steals the show away from Stiller and Wilson.<br /><br />The film is a major spoof on the fashion industry today, poking fun at the high maintenance, vain personalities of today's socialites.  In the middle of this fast paced world of hair products and wax-jobs lies Derek Zoolander, quite frankly the most legendary of male models.  Derek sits atop the world comfortably, that is until Hansel comes along poised to take his fame and respect.  Hansel is the male modeling worlds freshest face and his `cool guy' persona and `no cares' attitude quickly make him a hot commodity leaving Zoolander jealous and emotionally shattered.  In this state Zoolander is particularly vulnerable to the evil manipulations of fashion designer Mugatu.  Mugatu is fed-up with the prime minister of Malaysia and his promise to end the countries child labor which would as a result create a huge dent in Mugatu's profits.  He orchestrates an elaborate scheme to brainwash Derek Zoolander to assassinate the prime minister at a fashion show for his new line especially created in the prime ministers honor.<br /><br />In the meantime Derek also has to content with the intrusive reporter Matilda Jeffries and the sneaky Mugatu spy Katinka.  Derek also has issues to work out with his own self esteem with regards to his father and the love and support his father refuses to give him because of his chosen profession.  No matter how successful and famous he becomes he'll still only be a laughing stock to his father.<br /><br />That and the whole turning left thing.<br /><br />The film is filled with some of the funniest one-liners I've ever heard and has some of the funniest comedic performances to date.  Ben Stiller is just effortlessly hysterical as Derek Zoolander, and he's only embellished by the great partnering with Owen Wilson who becomes Hansel in every way shape and form.  Stiller's real life wife Christine Taylor appears here as Matilda and does a great job, as does his real life father Jerry Stiller who plays Maury Ballstein, Zoolanders agent.  Milla Jovavich, Jon Voight and the rest of the start studded cast are excellent (except for Duchovny, I just didn't like him) but no one comes close to the brilliance that was Will Ferrell.  One of his funniest performances to date!  The film also features cameos by the likes of Donald Trump, Paris Hilton and Billy Zane just to mention a few.<br /><br />`Zoolander' remains one of my all time favorite comedies ever and is sure to bring a smile, a chuckle and a slew of full belly laughs.has issues to work out with his own self esteem with regards to his father and the love and support his father refuses to give him because of his chosen profession.

B000CNFC76|4.0|Just a fantastic feelgood story...and it is 100% true! Bill Paxton does a great job - accurately portraying the original storyline and preserving the history (the book is even better, but that is almost always the case).   I only take issue with one critical point that nobody but a golf nut will pick up on, and does not really change the story in any way: Bill Paxton takes great pride in the accuracy of this story (as seen in the bonus material), yet even though they were on location for some of the film, he showes the seventeenth hole at \\"The Country Club\\" as a dogleg right during the final round when Vardon hits it in the bunker. It is not. It is a dogleg left! Sorry, had to mention that because I just could not believe what I was seeing - even rewound it to double check. Great movie still, but then truth is always better than fiction.
0307387178|5.0|This book should be read to help us all get out and do something with our lives. We are living, so go live. Life only gives us a certain amount of time. And time goes so fast.  I'm not suggesting you sell your belongings and become a nomad; (unless that suits you) but be active. Life is too short to sit around and be stale.   Read this book. I hope that a piece of Chris McCandless stays with you reminds you to live better!  Jon Krakauer has done a fabulous job with hard project writing this book. I am grateful.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|Amazing, great songs and great performances. Only two words: Michelle Pfeiffer!!!!! She's just awsome! Funny, evil, a really good singer.  Queen Latifa WOW!! I lover her songs, her voice, so good. Travolta is the perfect one for that role, no one would have done better. I couldn't stop laughing, and he/she got me!  Chris, Zac, Nikki and James were so good, I enjoyed so much every minute, every song, everything!!  I've never thought I was going to love this movie so much. I saw it twice, and just after the movie ended, I ran to a store to buy the soundtrack. And I'm going to see it in a few days again.  Can't wait to have the dvd, with all the extras!!!!!!
0743298020|5.0|: ) ***** Dark, gothic, absorbing.  I just couldn't put the book down. ***** : )
B00011F5DK|4.0|Blokus is fun to play.  You need at least 3 players for the play to unfold properly. We took it on vacation. Adult children, grandchildren, great aunts and all had a grand time playing this game.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|I was very disappointed with this film. After seeing this show on Liquid Television on MTV in its animated form, I was initially very excited about this film. The plot was just plain terrible.  The actress playing AEon was the character in The Devil's Advocate who cut her neck open, to which she should have done in this film. At least that would have been entertaining.
0060853980|5.0|First, it's laugh out loud in some places, so be warned. Second, I loved trying to figure out who wrote what bit... it was easy, and I'm probably wrong on 90% of it.  Gaiman's dry and sharp wit tempered Pratchett's word play and silliness to make a SUBLIME novel prophecy about the (not quite) end of the world.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This DVD really rocks; you need to understand the goal of the director was not to make a definitive historical account of the 300.  The goal was to make a live action version of the graphic novel.  To that end, it is nearly perfect.  The colors, the shots, the visceral visual show is amazing.      I have read some reviews/critics discuss the lack of character development or personal progression.  I hate to rain on their parade but that is the point.  King Leonidas of Sparta was on a crash course with his fate and never flinched from doing what he had to do as a Spartan King, as a Spartan Citizen, as a Spartan Husband and as a Spartan Father.
1416523359|5.0|Those who think this novel could have been shorter clearly do not understand SK's gift for becoming one with the reader's subconscious.  In our inner voice, there is repetition; the variations on that repetition are how the unconscious mind works things out.  That's King's narrative voice.  If you want a shorter book, read someone else.    That being said, in this novel, much like (the rather inferior) Gerald's Game, it's not so much the otherword monster that terrifies as the very earthbound villain.  This is a very cathartic novel, in terms of turning grief on its head, embracing the anger we feel at loss, and using it to make us ultimately stronger.  The loss of a loved one leaves a whole in our heart, but we can still come out relatively whole despite it.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|The third CD from DOWN has effectivley established them as the best hard rock/metal band of the last 10 years. This 3rd CD is not as crushingly brutal as the first Cd and it is more focused and polished then the second. It still utilizes the crunchingly heavy catchy riffs and bare lyrics and vocals that made previous DOWN music so effective but this time there is more of a blue's influence and more soulful vocals to complement the inherent raw power. It also contains perhaps the best guitar tones on record since Tony Iommi. Perhaps the influence of DimeBag's untimely death and Hurricane Katrina's devastation has manifested itself in subtle musical additions to their sound. DOWN has not disappointed with each successive release. Lets hope that we have not heard the last of them.<br /><br />Standout tracks: \\"Nothing in Return\\", \\"I Scream\\", \\"Beneath the Tides\\" \\"N.O.D.\\"
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Kurt Russell as stuntman Mike is one of the coolest bad guys there's been in a while and he really makes this, dare I say, `chick flick' shine.  Seeing the double feature in the theatre with Planet Terror was such a treat- talk about getting your monies worth- but seeing it alone puts it in a whole new light.  The unrated version contains the missing dance clip so yearned for and the other additional scenes blend in perfectly, plus the sound and picture are superb.  A bit of the girls dialog does sound like guys talking at times, but overall it was very entertaining and well acted.  If you're not sure about this movie, see it!  I enjoyed it even more the second time and it blows away most of the summer blockbusters like Spidy 3.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|A lot of people are comparing this band to the Beatles. I enjoy this band, and I really can't stand the Beatles. So that says something. After seeing one of their videos  a few years back, I finally decided to get the LP. The songs have a style that is highly influenced by Rock music from the late 60s and early 70s- yet it doesn't feel like its stuck in time. There are also elements of Folk and Alternative Country.  The songs work for today. They aren't trying to hard to capture a sound from an Era. Rather the band brings that Era to today's sound. Some songs lack strong lyric- but that was the style of many of the upbeat Rock numbers of that style. But the strongest song lyrics wise are \\"Look What You've Done, \\"Move On\\"- which is reminiscent of (Alt Country bands like Wilco), \\"Timothy\\" , and \\"Radio Song\\". There are also plenty of high energy fun songs like \\"Roll Over DJ\\", \\"Get What You Need\\", and \\"Are Gonna Be My Girl\\". The album is well done and sensibility for modern listeners. So I don't think its stuck in the past at all. Its merging the past and the present in a very creative way.
0375758992|1.0|This is one of only two books I've ever bought that was so boring and weird that I could not finish it...and I've been stuck in a hotel room in Mexico for 2 weeks with nothing else to do!  It is fully of details of bodily functions; it's crude; and it's just plain dull.  This is one of the worst books I've ever bought.
B000UO338W|5.0|This album is great. I was a bit hesitant for I have been let down by the new CD's other Classic Industrialists have released, but NOT this one. The packaging alone is brilliant. If you have loved the last three albums inspired by the Bush administration, you will fall in love with this one. BUY IT ALREADY.
1891252089|5.0|A+, I HIGHLY RECOMMED!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this book!  My favorite thing is how they show each pose in the beginner, intermediate & advanced levels, + variations.  It has clear instructions on how to get into each pose, when to inhale or exhale, how long to hold the pose, the benefits, etc.  They even show how to utilize a strap when trying to progress to the next level of a pose. I've never seen that in any other yoga books including my certification materials.    The pictures are clear, details are easy to see, & the instructions are easy to understand taking you through each detail.    In my opinion the book is very professional in its LOOKS, CONTENT & MATERIALS. The spiral is secure and there appears not to be any danger of the pages coming loose.  **It also includes a lot of yoga poses &/or variations I haven't seen before.**    I've been teaching yoga at various fitness facilities for over 3 yrs. Most classes have participants that fall into each of the levels.  This can make it very challenging to give the more advanced students the challenge they need while also teaching the beginners the basics.  This book gives me a quick way to know the best way(s) to accomplish this while not compromising safety.      I have several yoga books but none have all the information, pictures, instructions, etc.  There is always a piece of information that I need missing from each book.  I have all now. The book has HIGH QUALITY Looks & Bindings without compromising on the information.     If you are in doubt click on the \\"SEARCH INSIDE\\" icon like I did and judge for yourself.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I still love the Room for Squares album, even after listening to it frequently the first summer I purchased it, four (or was it five?) years ago. The songs resonate with me in a way that keeps them fresh and alive, and makes me keep coming back for more. His catchy hooks are infectious; well written musically and lyrically. John Mayer is a good singer, songwriter, and player. If you've just discovered and enjoyed his more recent works, you will love this one.
B000UR366S|5.0|I have been a fan of Joni Mitchell since the mid 70's.  It was a time when I finally developed a taste for a different type of music--something that not only had great melody but also had thoughtful poetry that created something inspiring and moving.  I have her complete collection. Joni's music is something I enjoy very much.    It was a disappointment to read about her decision some time ago to stop making music.  I have looked forward to this CD ever since I first heard about its release.    I enjoy the CD very much, a recording rich with fantastic music.  Her voice is like electric velvet.  The jazz influence is fantastic, and the lyrics are incredible.  I hope she will continue sharing her musical art with fans.
1592402690|5.0|Few accounts of history are more accurate than the first-hand kind, and that is what we have with Mr. Emerick's outstanding book.  To his credit, this thoroughly British gentleman focuses on what he actually saw versus what is commonly known about the Beatles.  His tone is respectful, but he does not shy away from saying what he thinks based on what he saw and how he was treated.  Mr. Emerick went on to engineer and produce some great acts, which I hope are the subjects of a future book.  And consider this:  When I was 19, I was just learning to tie my shoes.  He was engineering the \\"Revolver\\" album!
B000A7DVR2|4.0|You either love it, or you hate it.  Great movie.  I hadn't seen it in a few years, but I did see it in the theatre when it first came out.  Best scene is when \\"The Dude\\" T-bones the dumpster down the side street, that'll leave a mark.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Lots of musical bang for your buck! The whole CD is a great compilation of mostly upbeat songs from madame Shania Twain. The CD has about 21 songs for a really decent price -- $9.99.
B000RG1FMO|1.0|Kanye West, full of talent and even more full of himself.  I miss the days when hip hop artists actually rapped about something.  Instead of just telling us how good they are, or how rich they are.  It's pretty pointless.  Also lots of songs nowadays are just \\"dance dance in the club\\" songs.  Nothing really has a story or a soul to it anymore.  Kanye turns in an album that's well produced (and that can easily be taken for granted) but very uninspired if you ask me.  His lyrics are pointless, so it basically comes down to whether or not his beats are fun, and well, a few songs are.. the rest are kinda off and just not catchy.  The best beat is on STRONGER, and that's only b/c of Daf Punk.  Anyway, if you can tell... i'm not a big Rap/hip hop fan... anymore... but i was really hoping this album would bring me in again... it did not.  The last album to dissapoint me was Eminem's curtain call, which was just terrible.  There are certain artists i expect more from... and this was one of those moments.
B00097A5HW|5.0|This CD is an outpouring of Shakira's more mature, thoughtful and emotional side. The CD is full of songs that are more mellow than \\"Grandes Exitos.\\"     Overall, the all-Spanish CD is excellent and offers a lovely, toned-down version of Shakira's vocal style.
B000W1YYEK|5.0|A great RUSH album at a bargain price -- what could be better? _Permanent Waves_ has one of my favorite songs of all time, Freewill. Spirit of Radio was a radio hit. Entre Nous was new to me, but also a great song. RUSH has an almost unique ability to sing about global, big-picture issues without descending into self-conscious conceit, and Permanent Waves is some of their best work.
B000NVL9KG|5.0|This is one the best if not THE best Progressive Rock albums ever recorded.  The combination of Classical music score structures and heavy progressive rock  is absolutely awe inspiring .Keith Emerson even out does himself here. I personally don't think that there is an other album with as amazing heavy keyboard work out there to be found. This coming from a huge Jon Lord fan so that is no small compliment. The drumming and bass playing are both also masterly laid down to provide the perfect foundation to hold the wild organ leads together even as Carl Palmer the drummer dishes out some very wild and musical licks all his own. Greg Lake's vocals are as passionate as ever as is his low end playing . All this and \\"Lucky Man \\" too. What else could a 70's heavy progressive rock fan ask for?!?!?  I say nothing ...buy it now the re-master sounds great !!!
1594489505|5.0|Once I opened this book, I was unable to put it down and I finished it in the wee hours of the morning with my eyes red from cying.  The story is absolutely riveting and I was completely caught up in the characters and their lives.  I am an avid reader, and I don't normally review books...but this one struck me as a must read for everyone.  I hope to read more novels by this author.
B00005JLFC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it many times since it first came out. The story is creative and the soundtrack is just beautiful! Whatever you may think of Barbra Streisand personally, she is incredibly talented and one of the best artists of my generation (I'm 49).     I certainly don't understand why Ms. Streisand's movies take years and years to come out on DVD. We waited three long years to get \\"A Star Is Born\\" even after Amazone said it was going to be released! We'd given up hope of ever receiving it, although we finally did.    I highly recommend this movie!
B000ICLRHK|4.0|Great Action... Looks awesome on Blu-ray.. This is a must have for all you action lovers.  Explosions are amazing in 1080p
B000UR366S|1.0|I can't imagine how painful it must be when a great artist loses the magic and has to go on to other things in life but Joni had the right idea when she first decided to stop making music.  I'll just keep listening to the earlier stuff.  If you don't know that stuff, do yourself a favor -- listen to anything by Mitchell from the late sixties or the entire seventies before you buy this.
B000002J0B|4.0|I love Houses almost as much as I love Led Zeppelin I and II. The distinct flavor of raw blues and heavy instrumentation is somewhat distorted (if not totally changed), but the talent is still recognizable, and the songs are still beautiful. I don't dislike any song in the entire album execpt the crunge, which flat out sucks. Most Zeppelin fans tend to like all the albums, perhaps they like the poppy songs from Zep's later years. The real purists abstain from anything that isnt Zeppelin I or II, which i feel is too narrow-minded. To each his own of course, but if you don't want Zeppelin lite and you can appriciate the change in musical style, a more experimental, cleaner, and more rock and roll oriented Zeppelin, you will love houses as much as I. Especially songs like No Quarter with its fantastic use of synthesizer are truly representative of  zeppelin's success with its musical change. The change is also appearent in lighter songs like d'yer mak'er and the song remains the same. Songs like the ocean and dancing days are hard enough to be reminescent of the early years, should be enough anyway to win the admiration of the raw blues purists. If i could I'd give this record a 4.5 instead of the 4 shown above. Unless you really want to own the cd, just download the songs online; Zeppelin or Amazon don't need any more money.
B000JJ4PDK|4.0|By Far the best, he out ways the rest. This 2 disc is great for all fans out there or new ones. Just a great cd mixed with sum classics of biggys that we all remember him for. Know one else raps like him 1 of a kind and the 2nd disc is great fill of sum video clips and a live performance with p-diddy. Point is its a great cd and if your not a fan bye this 2-disc cd as soon as you get your next pay cheque.
B000OVLBF8|2.0|GHOST RIDER is another of the comic-book-to-film ideas that cinema audiences have been inundated with as of late. [[ASIN:B000E1MTY0 BATMAN]], [[ASIN:B0002XK190 SPIDER-MAN]], [[ASIN:B000I2JKEC SUPERMAN]], [[ASIN:B00005JKC3 HULK]], have all made it from the graphic childhood page to celluloid, and some of them have done it well. But Ghost Rider sputters and dies.<br /><br />The most \\"inflaming\\" issue for me was Nicholas Cage ([[ASIN:B000JYW5DW THE WICKER MAN]]). He's, what, 43 years old? And he's playing an Evel Knievel-esque, motocyclying hotshot who jumps everything from cars to spinning helicopter blades? Puhleease! He's getting too old for these roles and it's showing. Someone younger and with a cockier attitude could've pulled of a much more believable Johnny Blaze (perhaps Heath Ledger?)<br /><br />The love interest of Roxanne Simpson played by the exotically pretty Eva Mendes was nice to look at, but stood out as a mere cardboard character delivering unbelievably cliched lines. Other than showing off her constant cleavage, she didn't hold any acting power.<br /><br />Peter Fonda as Satan (aka Mephistopheles) was okay but he's seen so little that we don't really give a \\"damn\\" about him.<br /><br />The over-the-top evilness of Satan's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) was weak and his motives never fully explained (other than he wanted to have a \\"Hell on Earth\\" via a forbidden city that is likewise never explained at all).<br /><br />My only soft spots for the film were the wickedly awesome bikes, the laughable (and appropriately so) Ghost Rider CGI moments, and Sam Elliott's intoxicating narrative. I've always enjoyed listening to Elliott's voice -- it's syrupy smooth and deep baritone was a great dichotomy against an ancient tale turned modern.<br /><br />But the film as a whole is exceptionally weak. The love story feels and looks forced (again, Cage is just too old for someone the likes -- and looks -- of Mendes), the character's interactions are whisked aside in favor of action that isn't explained, and those characters that are interesting are given so little screen time that we just don't care about the story at all.<br /><br />Aside from the cool motorcycles and Sam Elliott's voice, this one should have you burning rubber back to your local video store in order to return it as soon as possible!ose characters that are interesting are given so little screen time that we just don't care about the story at all.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Unique, superbly produced and acted, Serenity is a hugely satisfying follow-on to the Firefly series. I never saw the series before I viewed the film, but like millions of other Serenity fans, I consider this film and the series the finest SF I have ever seen. In every respect, this film is a joy to watch.

B000SZLSB2|5.0|Mr. James Blunt has brought back to the music world what has been lacking for sometime now and that is talent! There are entertainers and then there are artists. James is a true artist. I did not think he could top his debut album but I was wrong. His sophomore cd is even better. His talent is so diverse and multi-faceted. He makes it apparent in every song. To me the only downside is the 38 and a half minutes of music. I would have liked to see it be slightly longer. This is one brilliant album. Mr.Blunt is pure genius.
0061122416|5.0|I haven't given a 5 star review yet. Maybe it's because this is one of few `inspirational' novels that have actually held my attention, but I truly believe that every person should read this book once in their life. It's cheap and it's worth so much more than the money you spend. The irony is that this book fell into my hands at exactly the time it should have. You can only understand that after you've read the book...and more importantly...after you understand what you`ve read.     If you find this book to be poorly written and you get nothing out of it, then you've read it at the wrong time in your life or you simply didn't understand the message. I think most people who read it will get what they need from it, though.
0316168815|4.0|Everyone else is right.  Th book is great in the beginning.  It contains some odd scenes that are unnecessary and hurt, more than help, the story's momentum and punch.  The author tried to wrap up too many loose ends too quickly in the end, and I felt so dissappointed that a book I really enjoyed and that had so much potential ended so poorly.  However, I so enjoyed the beginning, that I got over the ending.      The aspect that I think I most enjoyed about the plot of this book, was that the main mystery was solved very close to the begnning.    You do not feel suspense waiting to find out \\"who did it?\\"  The author tells you who did it right away.  Then you don't feel suspense waiting to see when one of the other characters will figure it out, because another character figures it out right away.  You feel suspense waiting to see when others will believe and if the murdered will ever get caught.  Very non-traditional suspense.    I really appreciate books that make me FEEL.  Good, bad, hapy, sad, scared,or totally creeped out.  I just enjoy having my emotions provoked by a good book.  This book made me feel every one of those things.  I laughed and cried, sometimes one right after the other.  I definitely felt completely creeped out and oddly comforted really close together.  That's why this book is a winner.    This book will make you think.  If you don't like to feel sad, or uncomfortable, this book is not for you.  If you appreciate emotion and creativity, you will enjoy this different book.  I look forward to the movie, hoping they don't massacre the story.

0099489988|1.0|I'm not too sure where I stand with this novel.  It was a slow read for me, but it was still good.  It's about a woman who married a conniving adulterer.  He leaves her the day she has their baby, Kate, for a woman he had been sleeping with during the pregnancy.  That really made me furious....but what really made me mad was how the main character handled her jerk of a husband when he finally changes his mind and comes back....I had to skim through this part b/c I was so frustrated.<br /><br />I think it was a good summer read, but I think I wouldn't have picked it up if it weren't a pick of someone else's in my book club.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of dry senses of humor...but the other man in the story...ADAM seemed to be a hunk....and that story line I kept trying to get to!!<br /><br />So, there were good parts, and a lot of bad parts....but at least it made me feel some kind of emotion that I think was intended.  I think this was a first published book for this author...so I've been told that she has gotten better.

B00000DCH9|5.0|Billy Joel's Piano Man album on Columbia Records remains one of his best ever; and anyone who enjoys good solid rock from the 1970s will enjoy this CD very much.<br /><br />The track set opens with \\"Travelin' Prayer.\\" Listen for some great drums, fiddle, banjo and piano to create a country flavor for this ballad. Billy's voice is rich and full of masculine warmth--terrific! \\"Piano Man,\\" the title track for this CD, leaves nothing to be desired. It starts with some great harmonica playing; and when Billy Joel comes in \\"Piano Man\\" takes off like a jet! Billy sings some portraits of people who come to the bar where he plays piano. Moreover, \\"Ain't No Crime\\" is a beautiful, gospel flavored number with a backup chorus that harmonizes to perfection as Billy sings it well!<br /><br />\\"The Ballad Of Billy The Kid\\" gives us a country/western flavored arrangement as Billy sings the story of Billy The Kid and even compares himself to Billy The Kid but in a more positive light. Billy Joel sings \\"The Ballad Of Billy The Kid\\" flawlessly.<br /><br />\\"Worse Comes To Worst\\" actually has a catchy melody that reflects the optimism Billy's character feels that he'll get by no matter how hard life gets; and this song has a great early 1970s rock and roll beat to it! Listen for some great key changes on \\"If I Only Had The Words (To Tell You),\\" too.<br /><br />The album ends strong with the ballad called \\"Captain Jack.\\" Billy delivers this flawlessly with panache and sensitivity. Great!<br /><br />The artwork impresses me--how's about that cover photo?<br /><br />Billy Joel remains a titan in the music industry; and this title is well deserved. Billy is one of the very few versatile artists who can evoke whatever emotions he wants his audiences to feel with every song he sings or records. I highly recommend this fine CD to anyone who likes great rock music from the early 1970s.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B00000K2W1|4.0|During her all too short life, Janis Joplin made some pretty magnificent music. This CD, which has leftover space to be more comprehensive, gives us a good sampling of what magic Joplin could weave using her fine natural talents and abilities.<br /><br />The track set starts with her incredibly famous ballad, \\"Piece Of My Heart.\\" The electric guitars amaze me with their sound; and Janis sings this with passion, all her heart and soul and a type of panache I rarely hear or enjoy. \\"Piece Of My Heart,\\" a Janis Joplin masterpiece, gives us Joplin at her very best. She sings of her relationship with a man who doesn't treat her well; and the key changes as the band jams make this tune even better! The next Janis Joplin track, a cover of Gershwin's \\"Summertime,\\" stuns you with its beauty. Janis delivers this with passion, heart and soul. \\"Summertime\\" uses a few guitar tricks of the day to give this fine number a 1960s type of spin; and this works very well. Janis's version of \\"Summertime\\" truly showcases her remarkable talent.<br /><br />\\"Me And Bobby McGee\\" lets Janis sing a country ballad about herself and her man. The guitars and percussion help the number along and Janis sings \\"Me And Bobby McGee,\\" a thoughtful, pensive number about the freedom she and Bobby had as they traveled around the country. Although Bobby leaves his girl and moves on, Janis's character takes it in stride. I predict that you will enjoy \\"Me And Bobby McGee\\" very, very much.<br /><br />\\"Get It While You Can\\" begins with some terrific piano; and Janis sings this gospel flavored song without a superfluous note! \\"Ball And Chain\\" gets the royal treatment as Janis wails and sings this number so well; the electric guitars add to the natural beauty of this ballad as well. Janis delivers \\"Ball And Chain\\" like the master she was with great sensitivity.<br /><br />We get two bonus tracks; and I think you'll like the one entitled \\"Mercedes Benz.\\" Janis sings this a cappella with just a hand beating on her guitar. Janis uses this ballad to showcase the excessive materialism of today's society. Awesome!<br /><br />The liner notes give us a great essay by Jaan Uhelszki; and the fine artwork impresses me, too. We also get the song credits and recording dates for the songs on this CD.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they should have added at least an extra song or two to make this CD somewhat more comprehensive. The illustrious career of the great Janis Joplin cannot be condensed into a single CD with twelve tracks and a somewhat skimpy 47 minutes. This makes the CD very, very good but not great; and I have to take off one star for this disappointment.<br /><br />If you want to get to know just how wonderfully Janis could perform, you owe it to yourself to get this very good CD.<br /><br />Thank you, Janis!

It was very difficult to put  down.  And every time I returned to it I was eager to reconnect with the characters who were very well developed.   If you've read the Kite Runner then you are familiar with Mr. Hosseini's vivid portrayals of the culture and the characters.  I highly recommend this book.

B000RG1FMO|5.0|In a time and place where there are a lot of children, teens and young adults growing into this \\"hiphop?/rap?/what?\\" music, it's nice to know that the real thing is still out there. Imagine using multi-syllabic words in a song... Imagine telling a story in your song that's not all about how fast the girl's booty will shake... While some may not like Kanye for his brassness, arrogance, and sometimes smack-you-in-your-face truth, you have to appreciate the time he spends in the studio.<br /><br />This album is better than the last.  I like it because while some of the skits were funny, this album did not need any of that.  This is straight forward hip hop.  The music! Love it. Not every track is made to the same beat. Imagine not being able to rap five songs on your album to the same beat... Creativity. The tracks encompass the story, fun, and craziness that is hip hop.  Those are the things that was the hip hop of old.<br /><br />This album is true to Kanye, his fans, and the new fans. Sell out? No.  I didn't like every song but since when has that happened. 90% of the album is good so it's a keeper. Make a copy for your car.<br /><br />And when you get tired of hearing the stripper music that's currently blaring on the radio, this is the album you want to have right there. At least until the next Jay-Z drops... Don't tell Kanye I said that.<br /><br />Oh, and, I like Big Brother, the song for Jigga.

B000T05R8Q|5.0|\\"Piper\\" remains Syd Barrett's masterpiece. It's the only album where he was truly in control of Floyd (although he did contribute to the second it was in a diminished capacity). This set (which is bound like a book with lyrics inside and a reproduction of one of Syd's scrapbooks--albeit with a missing page due to legal issues which can be viewed at [...] eventually evidently this is because of obscenities scrawled on the page)is an import from Holland and sounds terrific.<br /><br />The first disc features James Guthrie's remaster of the original mono album. As Barrett/Floyd purists know, this is the one where Syd was involved in the mixing of the album and added various sound effects, etc. to make it distinct from the stereo version. Stereo in 1967 was considered something of a fad (the definitive version of \\"Sgt Pepper\\" for example has always been considered the mono version by The Beatles, producer George Martin, engineer Geoff Emerick and many of the fans because The Beatles were involved in the mixing and the stereo mix really was just thrown together)at the time and this was the edition that Pink Floyd and producer Norman Smith put most of their effort into.<br /><br />The second disc is the stereo version of the album. Personally, I would have liked EMI just to release the mono AND the bonus disc as most fans already have Doug Sax's terrific master from 1994. Guthrie's doesn't really improve on Sax's but still sounds fine.<br /><br />The third disc features singles recorded around the time of the album. It also includes some rarities including the previously unissued take 6 of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" and the French edit of the original album track which was sourced from a vinyl needle drop. We also get a number of singles that have appeared on other CDs included here. What's also new to this set is the stereo mix of \\"Apples and Oranges\\" and an alternate mix of \\"Matilda Mother\\" that will be of strong interest to Barrett fans.<br /><br />While I feel that the set is a bit overpriced and redundant (why include the stereo album AGAIN?), this is a nice set and would make a fine gift for Barrett and Floyd fans alike. It's nicely packaged although the booklet inside attached to the hardcover exterior came apart too easily with my edition. I would have liked to see better and more consistent workmanship with this set but that's my own pet peeve.<br /><br />Pick it up and you'll enjoy it! I'd also recommend [[ASIN:B000007MVM The Madcap Laughs]]and [[ASIN:B00000DQTO Barrett]]both albums completed with substanial help from David Gilmour and Roger Waters (the former)and Gilmour with Richard Wright (the latter)which gives a sense of what later Floyd albums might have been like.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I have watched the show from its inception and LOVED every minute of it.  This is one of the best series I have watched in recent years.  Its got depth to its characters and very good storylines.  The finale is UNBELIEVABLE!  Season 3 will be starting next week and can't wait.  Its funny to watch how they made subtle changes to the characters over time and to the way the present themselves.  Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are very good actors in this as well.  They appear to be actual brothers.  Pick this up and Season 2 as well.  You won't be disappointed!
B000RZIGVS|1.0|Granted, this set is cheaper than the other full set that was released a couple years ago, and cheaper than buying each season separately.<br /><br />But still - come on, Paramount, stop (expletiving) the fans! If you're going to re-re-release ST:TNG, then DO SOMETHING with it!<br /><br />I had hoped that they would release a set that might have commentary. Dear Sirs of Paramount: a great many TV shows are released on DVD with commentary on every episode. Even TOS DVDs come with a few text commentaries by Michael Okuda. For the love of humanity, why can't TNG get this?<br /><br />By this point in the game, EVERY episode of TNG should come with an audio commentary by cast and producers AND Okuda's wonderful text comentaries he's done for other shows.<br /><br />Until Paramount ponies up for some special features that are actually special, and actually show at least an iota of respect for the fans that have made Paramount fabulously wealthy, I ain't buying.<br /><br />I really hoped this one would be the magic set, but it's just the same old, same old, repackaged, in the hopes that the fans will empty their wallets yet again for a fancier box and a stupid extra DVD that Paramount most likely will never, ever release anywhere or in any way except in this overpriced fan-(expletiving) box set.<br /><br />Shame on you, Paramount.

1400079179|5.0|`The Da Vinci Code' is fiction; a fictional story about Sophie Neveu, a fictitious cryptologist working with the French provincial police, and Dr. Robert Langdon, a fictitious Harvard Symbologist, thrown together in a murder investigation by the victim himself with a hidden agenda which leads to a modern day search for the Holy Grail. This story is as captivating as the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, with a twist. It is a book that keeps your attention and you will not want to put it down.<br />As with all great books it makes you think, wonder \\"what if\\", and puts a spin on one of the most misunderstood, if not THE most misunderstood person in history. As a young boy going to catechism, I had strong interest in the story of Mary Magdalene. The nuns portrayed her as a repenting sinner, a [...], and it was disturbing to me why Jesus Christ appeared to a [...] first on the birthday of Christianity. It is so refreshing and surprising that I am not alone with my feelings.<br />To me, faith is having belief in something or someone without proof. I believe in God and Jesus Christ, I do also believe in Mary Magdalene.<br />I don't know if she was the wife of Jesus Christ. I do know that the Catholic Church slandered this woman and did not recant it until 1969, hundreds of years after the slanderous remarks made about her. The damage to her is almost irreversible but God acts in mysterious ways.<br />As many people believe it is the end of times, to me it seems odd that so much attention is being drawn to Mary Magdalene now. It is surprising to me it is happening on the cusp of a new Pope coming to power. I see something different in this Pope just by his first address to the people. Just my opinion, but I think we are going to see the church try to put Mary Magdalene in the place she belongs and let women take their rightful place in the church.<br />Last year I was at a retreat, and one of the classes was about Conclave; with the Pope's health failing and getting on in years, they thought it would be good for us to understand how it went about. This was the first place I was introduced to the man who has become our new Pope. The one thing that stuck in my mind was the requirements to be Pope.<br />First, you must be baptized but not necessarily a Catholic.<br />Two, you must be a male.<br />Three, there is no three at all; the two requirements are all there is. I believe this is showing the discrimination of women in the church in such a blatant manner that it is unforgivable.<br />So, if the church does not believe that Mary Magdalene is the wife of Jesus and she is not a disciple, then who is she?<br />Let me express my feeling of the birth of Christianity and the last days of my Lord. He was accused, tried, convicted, scorned, and forced to carry his own cross in pain and humiliation, which became the tool of his demise. The one thing through all of these events was the presence of Mother Mary and Mary Magdalene. As they both cried and prayed at his feet as he died, WHERE WERE THE DISCIPLES?<br />Mary Magdalene and Mother Mary helped to remove him from the cross then prepared his body and helped to place him in the tomb for final resting, they then wept for three days and nights with great pain and sorrow. On the third day he rose from the dead, did not appear to any of the disciples, or kings, or Rabbis, not even to his own mother. He chose to come to Mary Magdalene first, and to her alone to confront his pain. She is one of the most important, if not the most important person to Jesus Christ. This can be seen in this one example on the birthday of Christianity. She fills every requirement to be a disciple but she is not.<br />One reason could be that she is female, and the Catholic Church is the largest and most powerful men's club in the world, with the Vatican being the biggest men's locker room the world has ever seen. Remarks like, \\"a woman belongs to her husband\\", is just one example. If you or Imade some of the statements in the workplace that are made by priests in church, we could be fired; it would be considered sexual harassment. Accepting Mary as a disciple would rock the foundation of the church that Peter built. So I think we are at the end of times, the end of the old church and the men's club, and approaching the birth of a new church, with women standing next to men, THE CHURCH THAT MARY BUILT.<br />Or, is it as Dan Brown has so elegantly brought out in his book, that Mary Magdalene was the wife of Jesus.<br />This book is fiction but it asks real questions to every Christian; who is Mary Magdalene and why was she so important to the Lord? Why did the church try so hard to discredit her and write her out of the Bible?<br />Why the Gospel of Mary is restricted reading from the Catholic Church? I was in Mass one Saturday evening and this book was a big part of the homily, where the priest went on to say this book is blasphemy and not to be read.<br />I am confused, is this not censorship? Does not censorship feed mistrust, restrict the mind from growth, and stifle freewill. That's odd, because the church I was brought up in believed that freewill is the one thing that God the Father Almighty, the creator of us all, WILL NOT influence. I guess the leaders of the church think they know better than God<br />Speculation can take us down all kinds of roads. If God sent his son to us to forgive us for our sins and live among us as a man to understand man's suffering, why would God forsake Jesus of the most powerful emotion we as man can feel; the pain and beauty of love for another and the sense of parenthood.workplace that are made by priests in church, we could be fired; it would be considered sexual harassment.

1878424114|5.0|The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is easy to understand, yet beautifully written. The 3rd Law, the Law of \\"Karma\\" or Cause and Effect, helped me change my perspective during a difficult time in my life from feelings of extreme guilt to a sense of empowerment.     Deepka wrote that under the seventh spiritual law of success, the Law of Dharma, that we have \\"taken manifestation in physical form to fulfill a purpose... You have a talent that is unique in its expression, so unique that there's no one else alive on this planet that has that talent, or that expression of that talent. This means that there's one thing you can do, and one way of doing it, that is better than anyone else....\\" I draw upon these words for strength when I doubt my ability to do the work I wish to put forth in this world.     This is one of those books that might make a terrific gift for someone who is curious about spiritual concepts, but feels intimidated about getting into the subject. Highly recommended.
0307263118|5.0|John Banville is a crying out loud genius. I am a writer, and this book will carry me through several of my own books on inspiration alone. I have read it four times friom front to back.  Only a consummate genius of spirit, language, and craft could possibly have written this. Reading it requires, I think, an inveterate reader, for its structure is complex. His description of place will take you there and leave you to inhabit the place.  I found it common to read and re-read passages, pages, and, as I said, the entire book it is so beautifully rendered.  The story is touching and real to my inner self, and he is able to paint me, my innermost thoughts, my love for exquisite detail, scene, memories, and people with such solid and true foundation that humanity within me was discovered, illuminated, and honored.  Blue? Lost? Afraid? Grieving? Satisfied with your lot? Think humanity has gone sadly astray? Read this book. I swear you will never forget it.

B0009OORH4|5.0|This jingly-jangly gem has long been overdue for a proper remastering.  I'm glad to say they did it well.  The sound is crisp and clean, the way it should be, and it jumps out of the speakers with a solid pressence that did not come across in the original CD release on the Aim label. The extensive liner notes give a detailed account of what was going on with the band at that particular point in their history and puts the music in perspective. Sadly, there are no bonus tracks; however this one is well worth the rather high price.  I am most thankful.  Anybody want to buy my old copy?  Thought not!  Note:  I originally gave this 4 stars.  I must have been feeling ungenerous that day.  Upon re-listening yesterday, I wanted to give it 6.
B00006AW2P|5.0|Ah, back in the day when it was Brian Jones' band and the Rolling Stones were more interested in creating great R & B music than stardom and screaming girls. A release from the precious couple of years of the band's life before the ambitious Andrew Oldham (produced this and all the early Stones recordings) started moving them in a more \\"Beatlesque\\" direction in order to cash in.<br /><br />I have all of the ABCKO SACD remasters and I especially like the early material by the Rolling Stones before Brian lost all his influence.  I've also been a musician for over 40 years and remember the band's first appearance on the Ed Sullivan show, more years ago then I care to admit or even think about.  I was there at the beginning so I've been listening for over 40 years.  Given that, I'm exceedingly well qualified to provide you with an objective review.<br /><br />This was/is our introduction to \\"the band that will not die\\" (\\"Bullets can't stop it, rockets can't stop it, we may need to use nuclear force!\\").<br /><br />Anyway, this is a very solid first release.  There's really only one tune that caused me to raise an eyebrow.  \\"Now I've Got a Witness\\" includes a very cheesy Farfisa organ accompaniment.  But Farfisa organs were in all the studios back then so can we really blame them for letting Stu have a go on it?  The guitar and harmonica are quite good on this track anyway.  Other than that cheesy organ sound, there are no weak moments to speak of.  Sure, \\"Tell Me\\" and \\"Carol\\" don't seem to fit with the rest of the material but that's ok.  This is a very good R & B record made by some really talented young musicians.  I especially love listening to Brian Jones' lead parts and harmonica playing.  It was also a delight to hear his back vocal clearly on \\"Walkin' the Dog\\" even if it was a tad gruff.<br /><br />If you like the early Rolling Stones then this is one you must own; however, I would start with the insanely good \\"Rolling Stones Now!\\", their third US release.

The sounds used are well outside of the normal range. With my Dahlquist DQ-10 speakers, I was occasionally confused about where the sound was coming from, because I was pretty sure my speakers couldn't make those sounds.  In short, this album is an absolute must for audiophiles. I use a variety of tracks for testing speakers/headphones/amps/whatever, but I listening to track 8 (Line Dancing With Monkeys) always teaches me more than any other track in my collection.    This is a bold foray into electronica for Jeff. Unlike Who Else!, this really doesn't conjure up many memories of Classic Jeff Beck--which makes it really interesting. The variety of sounds, the way they're put together is pretty darned original as far as I can tell, and of course, the guitar samples are awesome (not surprising considering the source)--just full of nuance. I wish I had bought Who Else! first to ease me into this album, because it was such a shock to my ears, that for a while, I really didn't like it. After getting used to this album, the only thing I really find fault with is the vocal samples. They're not plastered all over the music or anything, but where they do appear, I find them awkward. That's why I only gave this 4 stars.    For those that aren't familiar with Jeff's work--this is techno-ish, but the samples are where fans of his earlier work will recognize him. Jeff is often called one of the most influential/important guitarists of all time (2nd most is probably fair), but his influence has mostly been through other guitarists, not direct to listeners. He's done a lot of groundbreaking stuff, and gone through many phases that sound quite distinct. I think after listening to that stuff you may hear this album differently.

B00004XQ8H|4.0|I heard Lisa Della Casa on the radio some time ago - her voice impressed me and I welcome the opportunity to buy some of her recordings at Amazon. Hers was a voice of extraordinary luminosity and timbre, lending a certain etheral quality to her performances. This is not so much brought out in the Vier Letze Lieder part, which suffers a bit from the too high tempo, but in the other parts of the CD her voice and interpretations of her parts really stand out. Listen to the CD as a supreme example of what a human voice can bring across.  Joern W.
B000005ZFN|1.0|Talk about a fall from grace. Wait, wait, back up. Talk about dropping all you have off a cliff. I consider Jethro Tull's work from 1969-1972 classic, with the best being 1969's Stand Up. But this... what is this? For one, it's one of the records that killed progressive rock's reputation. (I enjoy the genre a lot, too, and feel it gets unfairly underrated) - the other two are Yes' Tales of Topographic Oceans (I love Yes, but I never saw where they were going with that one - amazing instrumental work, though), and Genesis' Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (which I, in spite of being a moderate Genesis fan, have never heard). Really, this has got to be the worst of them. And Thick as a Brick was stellar! My second-favorite Tull release, in fact. That was a dead-on satire of \\"over-intellectualism\\" and \\"prfound thought\\" that, in its own way, managed to be a deep look at how easily society is manipulated by poets and wise men spouting nonsense. That's exactly what Anderson becomes here: a wise man spouting nonsense, only Bibically inspired nonsense. It has none of the quick-witted sarcasm that made Brick such a riot. And the stylistic variety that kept Brick from wearing thin. And the little instrumental blurbs that gave Brick its variety. They're there, but there's no balance in them. TAAB gave Anderson, Barre, Evan, Hammond-Hammond and Barlow equal time to shine. This is almost entirely devoted to Anderson and his variety of woodwinds, which has at this point expanded into soprano and sopranino saxophones; and Evan, who plays a LOT of organ and pseudoclassical piano. Martin Barre, who was always my favorite musician in the group, gets pusehd aside.<br />I commented earlier on the lyrics, but I thought I'd go in depth with that. What inspired Anderson to go from mocking pompous pseudomysticalism to actually singing pompous pseudomysticalism? Ian's obviously quite sarcastic - that's his whole schtick - which means it's also quite hard to believe whether or not he's ever sincere - the Aqualung album being my exception to that rule. So that makes me wonder: was Thick as a Brick representitive of Ian's honest thoughts on overintellectualism? Or was he, in essence, mocking those who mocked it? Or, alternatively, did he just let Thick as a Brick's success go to his head, which in turn led to him saying, \\"It's okay if I write these overblown, dead-serious lyrics, just because it's me doing it. Everybody else who does so is a wanker, though\\"? Really is something for me to ponder. I'll get back to you when I've made up my mind on it.<br />Right, and here's the biggest problem: Anderson got so carried away with his cliche-loaded, keyboard, flute, and sax happy Grandiose Statement that he forgot one tiny little detail: writing any real melodies that really stick with you. That's another thing that Thick as a Brick had going for it. All kinds of melodies. I'm not saying everything has to be shallow, vapid, face-value entertainment (I am a jazz fan, after all), but there's just nothing to latch onto here. For me, music needs some form of hooks to keep it from going astray - the lack thereof was precisely what went wrong with King Crimson's Moonchild, but that's another story. It's also one of the many things that goes wrong with this album. The only melody that really grabs me is the \\"Overseer Overture\\" part, which is my favorite bit on the whole record. On the other end, my least favorite is probably the opening three parts: \\"Life Beats\\" (just random noisemaking, again like Moonchild), \\"Prelude\\" (mericfully brief indulgent jamming), and \\"The Silver Cord\\" (gives us a taste of what the lyrics will be like, though the piano's pretty). I don't approve of either \\"Forest Dance\\", while I'm complaining. Though the entire album is just dry, unimaginative, overblown, and lacking. Basically, I can't recommend this. I know it has its ardent supporters, and I'm not here to give them a hard time about it (though I know SOMEone will give ME a hard time about my intense dislike of this disaster). I'm just saying, I don't think it's very good. And I would love to read a review of this by someone who thought this was the masterpiece and Brick was the indulgent bomb. But yeah, this doesn't make the grade. I guess sometimes the band catches fire, but it's a very occasional thing, and when they do, they don't keep it going for long.islike of this disaster).

B000QUCNOK|5.0|Even after reading the book, Perfume is the kind of a movie that can still shock and send chills down the spine. The story of a man born with no scent of his own but on a constant hunt for something that he can capture and anoint with to fit in is magnetic. I have never heard of a more interesting take on the world of scent mixed in with murder.     Ben Whishaw  as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was enigmatic, quiet, spooky, passionate and evil. I traveled though a flurry of emotions for him and his victims, knowing that his quest was very interesting yet it left a trail of despair and broken hearts of those who lost their loved ones. Death in the name of beauty if not a new phenomenon but it certainly is twisted when someone else has to pay the price. Alan Rickman, who also  plays Snape in Harry Potter movies, brings his uniqueness into the tale. The timber of his voice fits perfectly with the whole ethereal feel of the movie. His ruby haired daughter played by Rachel Hurd-Wood is Laura, the final ingredient on Grenouille's list to a heavenly scent.     18th century France comes alive in this fantastic movie. I have never seen so much filth, dirt and grease in any costume movie but it was all worth it, and I swear my senses of smell were heightened for hours after watching it. The extremely long list of makeup artists at the end credits confirmed my suspicion that this was done with meticulous care to breath more life into the story.  The soundtrack is marvelous, the scenery breathtaking and everything simply tingles with richness. This movie is enigmatic, there's not question about it but I enjoyed the subtlety and the shocks it caused, unless you jump and sweat what good was wasting all that time watching TV?    - Kasia S.
B000UFAURI|2.0|It's all been done before.  This album is \\"One by One\\" part 2, literally.  Except this album has a ton of slow songs.  Dave Grohl all of a sudden insists on making ballads, yet they're all completely terrible.  Doesn't he realize his voice isn't suited for slower songs?  He's got a voice that needs to either be singing melodic mid-range songs, or hard rocking songs.  Nothing inbetween.  This album completely misfires on every level.  It's completely unlistenable for the most part.  \\"Erase, Replace\\" and \\"The Pretender\\" are really the only 'good' songs on the CD, and they're not all that great.  Terribly disappointing album for a big Foo fan.

Fantastic HD DVD.
0783231032|3.0|Spielberg's blockbuster comedy 1941 never really caught on in the US and was better received in other parts of the world. The basic plot of the movie revolves around a real incident which actually took place in early 1942 instead of Christmas 1941. It involved a reported sighting of Japanese aircraft over Los Angeles and led to pandemonium and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition being fired into the night sky for nothing. Spielberg and his writers take this as a springboard for some serious slapstick and special effects on a grand scale.    Featuring John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, Robert Stack and Warren Oates, the cast is very strong and topped off with the hilarious combination of Toshiro Mifune and Christopher Lee as a Japanese-speaking sub commander and a German-speaking Kriegsmarine officer who seem to either understand each other or not, depending on your take. The support cast is all good though there are a few dull moments in the story line.    This film, more than any other by Spielberg, seems to have copped a merciless bagging over the years, probably because of its theme. It is mass hysteria evolving into huge street fights, aerial dog fights and land and sea gun fights which might not be everyone's cup of tea but in this day and age it is particularly relevant and perhaps would be more widely appreciated. On the other hand, it was made during the Cold War and it wasn't as appealing as \\"The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming!\\", which itself would have been a good film but for a terrible ending.    Given how nervous the world is today, it might be a good time to show it again.    The DVD is terrible. It is optimised for 4:3 letterbox so those with widescreen TVs get a tiny 2.35:1 picture which is okay if you can see it. Zooming your TV makes it look worse. The audio quality is pretty poor and there are some parts which are quite noticeably distorted. This is a good film which deserves to be re-released for new TVs or even HD.

B000MGUZM0|2.0|'Funeral' was such a good record: full of infectious, passionate and believable adolescent romance, done with anthemic fervor.  Arcade Fire plays grown up on 'Neon Bible' and the result is a pile of unearned, vague doom and gloom.  Their silly grandiosity, only hinted at on Funeral, is fully on display here.  Whereas 'Funeral' contented itself with the personal, 'Neon Bible' jumps out onto the canvas of the bigger world.  And they fall flat on their well-scrubbed, earnest faces.  The politics here travel between the ridiculously laughable to the appallingly offensive.  Yes, yes we know:  war bad, conservatives bad, blah, blah, blobbity blah.  With the exception of the old song 'No Cars Go', which revisits their earlier, utopian yearnings, these songs are so trite as to be unlistenable.  Bruce Springsteen had reached a certain age when he recorded the wondrous 'Nebraska'.  And sorry Win Butler, you are no Bruce Springsteen, not at your age, not yet.  The best songs on 'Funeral' can hold their own against the Springsteen anthems of 'Born to Run', but let's not fool ourselves that anything on 'Neon Bible' can even come close to 'Nebraska' or any of the other songwriters Butler tries to summon on this lame record.  The cheesy, overblown packaging adds an extra dollop of banality.

B000L22WTO|4.0|A Mini CD from the 2006 David Gilmour Tour of Europe,\\"Arnold Layne\\" adds to any Pink Floyd Collection.  Fine tribute to original Floyd member Syd Barrett,also.<br /><br />There are three songs with two versions of Arnold Layne.  One with David Bowie and the other with Floyd member Rick Wright. Nice contrast and they blend well with a slight nod to the Wright cut.<br /><br />Dark Globe, from Syd's first solo release \\"The Madcap Laughs\\", might be the best song. Excellent David Gilmour rendition of a cut he was involved in when \\"Madcap\\" was released in 1970.<br /><br />An import CD, \\"Arnold Layne\\" is priced high (old EP's had at least four songs). Floyd fans should be pleased, however, with the great sound and the excellent band assembled by Gilmour.<br /><br />The CD liner notes end with the following:<br /><br />\\"Dedicated To The Memory Of Syd Barrett\\"
0765350386|5.0|Fantasy/SciFi novels often suffer from being very formulaic.  I was pleasantly surprised by the uniqueness of Mistborn.  It's been a long time since I was entranced by a novel and this one did it for me.  I strongly recommend it to all Fantasy/SciFi readers out there.
B00005JPRD|1.0|Across the Universe is an uninspired, predictable shamble of a movie.<br />In my opinion, the film is plagued with a superfluous amount of unwarranted close-ups, and drags us through songs we've all heard sung much better a thousand times, over and over again.<br /><br />None of the characters offer any type of motivation to keep watching the movie; being either too bland, or coming across as caricatures of what could have been real people. The addition of Bono to the cast does the film no favors either.<br /><br />The film falls short in every way possible; in it's attempt to appeal to either the faulty nostalgia of those who grew up in the era depicted, or  the wish-they-were-bohemian kids who will go to see it and say they loved it in an attempt to be trendy.<br /><br />Reviewers praising the cinematography or story or the film need to watch better movies or read a book. Seriously, don't waste your time and money seeing this movie. Put on a Beatles record and listen to that instead.
B000VZUWZW|5.0|OK, so it helps if you know some brainiac things, but the show is damn funny, quick , and witty. I've seen reviewers complaining about the Laugh Track, or how the actors are dressed, etc. First off I don't why the laugh track is annoying to people - it's a comedy show, does it make it better somehow if you hear real people laughing ???? I think not. Second, the actors dress stereotypical because it's a show about geeks - OK, so they're not how typical \\"Geeks\\" dress ( I should know, I've been one for over 25 years ); but does this offend me ??? NO !!!  Third, as far as people saying this isn't funny - Well, in my opinion they're either clueless or their dull and boring and probally don't laugh at anything, or the \\"laughing\\" part of their brain has been damaged by too many poor relationships that just didn't \\"work out\\". But seriously, I'd really like to know what those people consider \\"funny\\".

031236198X|5.0|Our organization is currently going through a structure change in one of our divisions.  We are using this book as pre-work to attending our training on the change.  We've found that having the book as a reference tool has really helped our team leaders relate better to the various stages of change that their team members (and themselves) are going through.      Not only is this book informative but it is also light-hearted, funny and thus, easy to read.  Not one person in our organization has said that they did not enjoy reading the book and that they couldn't relate to a character in the book.  I would highly recommend it to any organization preparing their team members or team leaders for change.
1932100660|5.0|This is the study so many health books reference, and it simply can't be ignored. Dr.Sanjay Gupta mentions it in his book, and there are a host of other ones, mainly about HEALTH not weight, that state that this is an extremely important and pertinent study. So many doctors agreeing on one study tells me to take note, and after reading it, I must say it has changed my thinking on diet and nutrition and health in general.<br />Dr. Campbell concludes that the most healthy diet is a vegan one by the end of the book. However, that is not to say that even reducing the meat you eat, along with other animal products won't garner significant health benefits. In the last year I have made two diet changes, and this was one of them. I reduced the amount of animal product in my diet, and though I have not completely cut them out, I have seen significant health benefits. My autoimmune symptoms that I have had for years are gone, and I am off of all lupus medication. This is not a scientific study, this is purely anecdotal, but it means a lot to me, and I will continue to pursue reducing animal products in my diet until, perhaps, I am meat/dairy, etc... free. It seems to me that if we are in the grip of any disease, the least we can do is take note of Dr. Campbell's massive study and try changing our diet. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain. And, if we are healthy, we might want to do what we can to stay that way.
B00006JSS8|4.0|So many of the early hits that I grew up with are in this collection. They brought back a lot of memories. I do believe my favorite Stevie song is \\"Sir Duke\\" mainly because of the arrangement. There are new songs to me in this collection which I have come to enjoy, but it is his top 40 songs from the 60's and 70's that really get my toes tapping and get me humming along. A great collection for the casual Stevie Wonder fan.

B000VDDDY6|3.0|If you recall, the original Season 1 DVD was released for $140 MSRP. I bought mine for $115, so the price for a high-def upgrade is only $10 more. Not bad at all.    And if you think that's still too high, just wait for the price to drop.  Like all the other Star Trek discs, it will eventually be available for half its current amount.    As for the CGI upgrades:    - They really didn't impress me too much.  There's maybe 30 seconds of new footage per episode (on average), which is nothing to get excited about.      -  In fact, I'd actually prefer it if Paramount released the original episodes with NO upgrades of any kind (just clean the negatives and then scan them in High Definition).  I liked the model effects/ hand-painted landscapes that were used in Next Generation and the Original Series.  I'd like to have them on disc, albeit in HD.    Oh one more thing:    - Star Trek's first season is the most solid season of all the series.  Gene Roddenberry imported lots of talented writers from the world of science fiction novels (like Harlan Ellison), and both Gene Roddenberry & Gene Coon had many fresh ideas that they had been working on for roughly two years time (1965-67), such that the end result was a fantastic \\"boom\\" on the screen.  Nearly every episode I would label as \\"great\\".      - Plus, you don't get a skimpy 20 episodes of only 40 minutes (like today's modern shows).  You get nearly 30 high-quality episodes, each 51 minutes long!  A great deal.    :-)

B00005JN2Z|5.0|Within an actor's career there is generally one film, sometimes more, that is viewed as a defining moment for that actor. The point at which no matter what is going on in the person's public life, according to the media, or however many successful movies or flops they've had throughout their career, a moviegoer sees this defining moment and says \\"This person is actually a really solid actor, and completely sold me on their character, to the point I actually forgot who the actor was I was watching.\\" Or at least say or think something to that effect after watching the defining movie. Anyways, it doesn't really matter how long a person's career is, this moment can happen early or late in a career, it's all a matter of the right material at the right time. For Tom Cruise, his defining moment, actually moments in his case, would be \\"The Last Samurai\\" and \\"Collateral\\"; the latter is the one I believe was his biggest moment. Both movies came later in his career, long after he had become a household name.    \\"Collateral\\" takes place in Los Angeles over the course of one long night for a cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx), whose newest fare, an outgoing man named Vincent (Tom Cruise), is about to turn his life upside down. Unbeknownst to Max when he took this newest fare, Vincent is a contract killer who is in town to make five stops, which amounts to five kills, and then leaves L.A. as if he was never there. Now, Max must struggle with the fact that he is essentially becoming an accomplice to the murder of 5 people, while at the same time he is trying to find a way to not only survive the night, but also save a few of the people's lives in the process.    For me, \\"Collateral\\" is the biggest defining moment in Tom Cruise's career, I know I said he's had two moments, but this movie is much more significant than \\"The Last Samurai\\", in terms of how convincing his performance truly was. In this movie Tom Cruise still plays a likeable character, to an extent, but one with a much darker side than most of his characters, and over the course of the movie Vincent loses all of his charm, becoming even colder, to the point that there is no possible redemption for him in the audiences eyes. To my knowledge, this is the first time that Cruise has ever played an all-out villain, sure he's played a few characters with questionable morals and what-not, but never one that is purely cold, calculating and in the end, evil. Another surprise for me, was the fact that Tom Cruise actually allowed his hair to be dyed gray, further evidence that he really wanted to sell this character to the audience and make them forget who it was they were watching, and know only the character on the screen. Everything about Cruise's performance was brilliant, from his charm that masked his underlying evil, to his extreme intensity and sharp focus, he never once missed a beat, and that is what allowed \\"Collateral\\" to become such a defining moment in his long career.    The supporting cast, primarily Jamie Foxx, was very solid, engaging and thoroughly believable. Jamie Foxx delivered an excellent performance as a cabbie who is deluding himself and those around him into believing that he will one day own a limo service for the rich and powerful. The change Max endures over the course of this one difficult night with Vincent is so deep that you see everything about him change before your eyes. From his attention to detail and cleanliness to his delusions of grandeur, nothing about Max would ever be the same after this night was over, and Jamie Foxx handled the evolution of his character with such ease and believability, that it's easy to see why he's become such a big star in Hollywood.     Directed by acclaimed director Michael Mann (\\"Heat\\"), whose great attention to detail and character development is appropriately suited to just this type of material, the fate of \\"Collateral\\" could not have been in any better hands. Mann has managed to direct such big name stars as Al Pacino,Robert DeNiro, and Colin Farrell throughout his career, and he's become so powerful within the Hollywood system, that he actually had the clout to be able to reject Tom Cruise, at first, in regards to the role of Vincent. It wasn't until Tom participated in a test, where he acted as if he was a deliveryman, a test that Mann used as a gauge for whether or not Tom Cruise could be believable in the role, that he won the role and the opportunity to prove just how talented he really was.    \\"Collateral\\" is the kind of movie that demands your attention from start to finish, as it continuously builds up an intriguing story and increases the tension as the minutes tick by, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats until the credits roll.    \\"Collateral\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|First of all, I will say if you missed Death Proof and it's companion Planet Terror as the Grindhouse package in theaters, you really missed a fun cinema experience.  It's a shame that it couldn't have been marketed better, because it truly was a fun, cinema experience that is difficult to grasp for these two extremely different films.    However, Tarantino amazingly one-ups his own brilliance with Death Proof.  The two main reasons this is recommended:  Kurt Russell and Zoe Bell.      Kurt Russell turns in a bizarre, and dare I say Oscar-worthy performance as 'Stuntman Mike.' (I have no remote hopes he would ever be considered for a nod, however.  It's not a traditional 'Oscar' role.)  However, he plays a sexy, creepy, evil, spineless madman like no-one's business.      And Zoe Bell...if you haven't seen the film, she has 20 minutes near the end that will absolutely blow you away.  The fact it's clear that she did her own stunts will be enough of a thrill.  In a day and age where CGI has made the typical moviegoer very blase, Tarantino finding a stuntwoman who can act, (she has a charm that just jumps out of the screen) her work in this is literally jaw dropping.    The film, overall, is just plain fun.  It makes no attempts to deliver a solid plot.  It doesn't pretend to be something it's not.  It's a well-delivered tribute to 70's exploitation/muscle car films.  The ending is one of the best 'pay off's/in jokes' of any you will ever find.  (It's very in-keeping with old grindhouse-type films that were long on ideas but woefully short on budget.  lol).    It's got typical, wordy dialogue, the most amazing car chase scene you will EVER likely see, a balls-out performance by Kurt Russell that shows mastery in restraint and outright menace, cool cars, lots of titillation...in short, a great movie to have fun watching!
0375703764|1.0|I really wanted to like this novel. I paid about $20 for it. To the author's credit, it's certainly an ambitious novel, perhaps the most ambitious novel I've read for this decade. Perhaps part of the problem comes from Danielewski trying way too hard to come up with something creative and unique.   However, footnotes and the unusual way the words are actually arranged on the paper hardly make it beautifully written or even literary (it just wastes about a hundred pages of paper per printed copy, and that means that ultimately you're not paying an extra five dollars for more words, just black spaces). The fact that it is incoherent doesn't make it artistic.   While the story begins with an interesting concept, the storytelling (and I use that term somewhat loosely) is so detached that I don't really care who lives or dies. In fact, about halfway through the book I'm actually hoping that Danielewski will finish some of the characters off, just to get them out of the way (and maybe cut the book down some 200 pages). The entire book is very dreary without being intellectual, which leaves one feeling depressed but not frightened, and the book's portrayal of a spiral into madness isn't believable or engrossing.   The awed reviews this novel reeled in did not prepare me for 700 pages of wasted ink and paper. Maybe at the hands of a different writer this book might have something else. As it is, this might just be the most awful book I've ever read.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This series has blown me away in terms of the picture quality and absolutely astounding locations and footage captured.  Definitely worth the money in terms of being able to see the earth as you probably never would otherwise.  The only downside I see is that the series is really geared more towards showing the whole earth and therefore does not go very deep into any one subject/area.  Just as you are getting into a particular environment, the scene changes to a completely different area and it leaves you feeling a little short changed.  Perhaps I am too used to watching 1 hour nature specials that delve much deeper into one subject, but I just feel that this series fails to really connect with the viewer in a certain way.  Overall though, I still think it is an incredible series that has done a great job in displaying the absolute beauty of nature.
1401300529|5.0|This volume typifies the care with which the author develops his books.  The start is the surprise appearance of Chinese troop at Unsam in October of 1950.  Their vast numbers and surprise attack shredded American forces, which had advanced by then deep into North Korea.  The discussion of the fighting is classic Halberstam, with a lot of veterans reporting their experiences here, with great detail to provide a sense of the confusion and chaos as the Chinese attacked.  And, amazingly, General Douglas MacArthur proceeded as if all was well as the Chinese melted back into North Korea after the attack, no longer to be seen.  The continuing march to the Yalu River, of course, was to have dire consequences for the American and Allied forces.    The book then examines the context for the outbreak of the Korean War, with a look at key actors--from MacArthur (no longer, apparently, at the top of his game), Mao Zedong, Kim Il Sung (the leader of North Korea), Syngman Rhee (the South Korean leader), Harry Truman, to Joseph Stalin.  Many other characters are portrayed as well, such as Dean Acheson and George Kennan and Chiang Kai-shek.  The depiction of these characters in the unfolding drama provides context, as does placement of Korea in the historical context of repression under the Japanese for much of the first half of the 20th century.      One example: the detailed discussion of Douglas MacArthur is not very flattering.  But the description of his relationship with his father (a Civil War hero) and mother (a \\"stage mother\\" to her son's military career) and his need to always be right and to have control helps understand some of the decisions made early in the war.  Many will doubtless be upset about this portrayal of the General, but it is one of those detailed descriptions for which Halberstanm is well known.    Then, the actual invasion of the South by the North in June, 1950 is laid out.  The discussion includes the dawning realization in Japan (MacArthur's HQ) and Washington D. C. of what is happening \\"on the ground\\" and their military and political response.  In great detail, the book considers the battlefield picture, including the surprise and effective counterattack by MacArthur's forces at Inchon, the rolling up of the North Koreans, and--then--the emergence of Chinese troops to turn the picture around once more--and finally, to the deadly stalemate near the line from which the war had begun.    Some of the more valuable aspects of the volume are the interviews by the author with surviving veterans.  These data provide invaluable richness to the text and make the nature of the fighting come alive for the reader.    In short, another epic work from David Halberstam.  He died shortly after completing the book in a car crash, so this represents his last major work.  It represents the author still at the peak of his powers.  A book well worth attending to.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|Fleetwood Mac's big double album is pretty solid, though a few songs make it not a flawless listen.  I think Stevie Nicks contributions may be the weak points of the album, while the shorter, catchier songs are the immediate highlights.  That doesn't include \\"Sara\\" which always manages to bring a tear to my eyes.  While it's true Fleetwood Mac would never have the same kind of wonderful creativity again in the future, at least we can look back and enjoy this enormous collection of memorable songs.  To be honest, I think the Peter Green period of the band was the best (especially the live albums from the late 60's and early 70's) but I can appreciate the change in sound and style the band would showcase when the mid 70's came around.  Anyone can appreciate the variety and creativity featured on Tusk.
B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|Cage's last few movies; Lords of War, Weatherman and now Next, all fall short of what we have come to expect. Next starts of interestingly enough, gets exciting with the pursuit through the casino, then enthralling with the run down the mountainside and entrancing with the action scenes at the warehouse, tobe totally dashed to pieces with the last five minutes of what could have been a perfectly fantastic flick. Totally anticlimactic folks! It leaves you wondering, \\"How could I have wasted my time and money on this?\\"
B00005JP5P|4.0|This movie is a character study. It's not an adventure flick. Think The Fugitive or Alien rather than Star Wars. In the Fugitive and Alien, the audience had just enough backstory to be able to empathize with the characters' decisions; so too with this movie.       The cinematology was worth the rental price. A wonderful early foreshadowing scene showed the sun morphing into an eye as the ship was silhouetted against it. Such touches will keep folks watching the movie in the future, much as folks watch 2001, A Space Odyssey.       The acting was competent, though I agree with other reviewers who noted how little interpersonal relatonships contributed the the character studies. I think the movie suffered because it didn't work in more of such human pathos. The end of humanity should have pathos, after all.       One disappointment. The writer and director elected to add horrific elements near the end, elements that I didn't feel belonged in a character study.
B00005JPTA|5.0|I found A History of Violence to be a good movie, but Eastern Promises is crafted into something even better. The acting by Viggo Mortensen is outstanding, even Oscar worthy, while Naomi Watts and Armin Mueller-Stahl lend good work as well. The movie is just the right length at about 1 hour and 45 minutes. It doesn't feel rushed or too long. The movie is gory and brutal, but not nearly as violent as I expected going in. If you liked A Histroy of Violence or mob films in general, this film should land on your best of 2007 list.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars

Or better yet, those things that you yearn to tell your best friend, provided she won't look at you with judgement or 'I told you so' eyes?<br /><br />Gilbert told ME those things.  She did.  In this whirlwind tour of Italy, India and Bali she dug deep into her heart to find what made her tick so that she could emerge whole, human and lovable.  And she details the tale for us.<br /><br />At times angry, other times sad, and yet at other times hopeful - Gilbert masterfully weaves the lessons she's learned on her travels and puts them into terms that we each can relate to.<br /><br />It's comforting knowing that a woman with \\"everything\\" including a book contract/advance that allowed her to take this trip, is as human as you or I - and that there IS a happy ending if we're just avialable to see it.

B000A32KJQ|3.0|This music on this Manu Katche album does seem a little \\"handcuffed\\" as another reviewer puts it but to label it smooth (ie. in the same genre as Kenny G) is certainly too harsh.  Seems more like its generally stuck in 2nd &/or 3rd gear & certainly doesn't show off Stanko or Garbarek to anywhere near their full potential.  The best example of what I mean is \\"Lullaby\\" a track that according to its title should be lilting & relaxing yet instead comes off as stilted & pre-programmed. Katche's drumming is generally fine although often a bit too \\"busy\\" with the star of the disc being undoubtedly pianist Wasilewski.  The two highlights in an otherwise fairly subdued outing are February Sun (haunting trumpet lead from Stanko & some of Katche's more restrained, tasteful drumming) & the drop-dead gorgeous & infectious closer Rose with beautiful rich tenor sax from Garbarek & which is almost worth the price of the entire disc.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|The Blu-ray version of this series as seen in 1080p is a treasure. The only caveat is that the voice-over dialog is less than perfect if you don't have an audio system which will allow for adjustment of the center channel containing the dialog portion of the disc. Other than that, it's still a must-have for any video-file's collection of Blu-ray's.<br /><br />Just as an FYI, I played this series using a Sony S-300 video player connected via HDMI cable to a Sony 52\\" XBR3 television.
1592332803|5.0|Whether you want to bake a quick batch of oatmeal cookies on a rainy day or you'd like to impress your dinner guests with a mouthwatering apple strudel that will leave them breathless and begging for the recipe, you're going to love \\"The Joy of Vegan Baking.\\" Colleen Patrick-Goudreau is well known as a Renaissance woman -- chef, entrepreneur, teacher, writer, activist, podcaster, public speaker and more. She's so busy I'm frankly amazed she had the time to devote so much care to this beautiful cookbook.     What makes \\"Joy\\" a joy is that Colleen uses her vast experience and talent as a vegan cooking instructor to genuinely demystify baking (the \\"Compassionate Cooks\\" in the subtitle refers to her business). She knows how to teach, and the proof really is in the pudding (page 184). \\"The Joy of Vegan Baking\\" is extremely user-friendly, even for someone like me, who wouldn't know a spreader from a spatula; this book now has me whipping up desserts like Martha Stewart on steroids.    Although you may be interested in this cookbook because you are vegan or want to give it to a vegan, it is perfectly appropriate for non-vegans as well. Indeed, the treats and sweets here are not only as delicious as anything you'll find in any bakery, but they are generally healthier, since they obviously use no animal ingredients (good for you, the planet and the animals).    Some of the goodies Colleen guides us through:    Muffins, biscuits and scones  Cakes and cupcakes  Pies and tarts  Sorbets, shakes and smoothies  Cookies, brownies and bars  Crisps, cobblers, crumbles and whole-fruit desserts  Strudel, crepes, blintzes and pastries  Yeast breads and rolls  Confections and candy  Frostings, sauces, syrups and spreads  Mousses and puddings    As you can see, baking isn't the only ground covered here. Basically, if it's sweet, crispy, frozen, fruity, frosted, gooey, glazed, rich, flavorful, chocolatey, savory, decadent or otherwise delicious -- from comforting cupcakes to succulent smoothies -- you'll find it in this comprehensive, lushly illustrated cookbook. I also love how Colleen fills the book with bits of food lore, baking tips, decorating ideas and suggestions for healthful eating (yes, even desserts can be guilt-free).    But wait, there's more! As she does so well her in cooking classes, Colleen explains the suffering animals endure to provide a fleeting pleasure for human palates. Really now, when food tastes THIS incredible, is easy to prepare AND is cruelty-free, what more could you want? (Actually, you'll also enjoy her DVD: [[ASIN:B0006FKL58 Vegetarian Cooking with Compassionate Cooks]])    Don't let the holidays go by without this book in your kitchen. In fact, get a few -- you'll want to give them to your friends!    ~ Mark Hawthorne, author of [[ASIN:1846940915 Striking at the Roots: A Practical Guide to Animal Activism]]
B000SNUMC0|3.0|One reason I bought this album was to hear it for myself after the varied reviews here.I have a few problems with it.Tim Owen's voice is too \\"formulaic\\" for want of a better description.He doesn't have a bad voice,it's just that he lacks the emotion of Mat Barlow.The music in the first half sounds too much like Gettysburg [Glorious Burden]for comfort.Not so in the second half;it's as if they've realised that.To fully appreciate what's missing in this album,all you have to do is listen to the first track and last three tracks of Something Wicked this Way Comes,Dantes Inferno from Burnt Offerings,or Travel in Stygian from Night of the Stormrider;and you will appreciate what is missing on this latest release.    I've since modified this review as I think F.A. needs a few listens to fully appreciate.Also I've recently bought [and sold] Judas Priest's latest concept album ,Nostradamus,which is definitely not as good as Armaggeddon.In fact it puts F.A. in a much more favourable light,I must admit.
B000P2A24W|2.0|With Bon Jovi it is hit and miss. One of my favorite bands, so I get every album. But this one bored me the first week.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|I have plenty of AC/DC albums/CD's/Tapes over my lifetime, but I always had live versions, never the originals with Bon Scott in them. I didn't need this CD, but I thought I might like it. I am enjoying every song on this CD, some of which I have never heard before. I especially enjoy Rock N Roll Singer, and I wish I had heard it before. I get chills when I hear his voice, his music is true & passionate.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Although a good album, I liked the tracks he wrote himself to be the best. I wish he would do more of his own stuff. Love the voice.

B000FUF6QS|1.0|If you thought Rowan Morrison was missing...   Well in this version Gently Johnny, the best scene in the entire movie is missing!      Apparently most of the hype regarding the extended or un-cut version has to do with the scene Gently Johnny, a folk song and dramatization of an offering to the goddess of love, Aphrodite. The scene epitomizes the underlying theme of the movie and without it, the impressionism of this version is lacking.      Since I was anticipating this scene only to discover that it had been deleted, I have to express my disappointment not in the cinema, but the censorship. In the brilliant mind of the editors, why then did they not delete the Landlord's Daughter and the scene of her dancing?     If you are not familiar with this scene or the value of artistic integrity, try to imagine the Birth of Aphrodite by Sandro Botticelli at the Uffizi Gallery, without Aphrodite.  Then ask yourself, it it's the same and would you still be inclined to make your purchase?     Amazon.com... I'm dissatisfied with the dvd; I got jipped!
1582701709|4.0|Having read numerous books related to personal and/or spiritual growth over the years, I was of course very interested in reading \\"The Secret\\" based on the enormous attention it has received in the media. In general, I found it to be a very nice starter book for any individual interested in learning more about the basics of the Law of Attraction. Ms. Byrne did a good job of assembling content from a wide variety of spiritual teachers, and also of weaving in content regarding her own experiences in applying this law.<br /><br />What \\"The Secret\\" doesn't do as effectively is provide the reader with some concrete tools that can be used to apply the Law of Attraction on a moment-to-moment basis. In essence, it tends to oversimplify the process of manifestation, for as all people have learned there are times when our desires aren't always satisfied even when our thoughts are primarily positive.<br /><br />To overcome this limitation, I highly recommend that readers of \\"The Secret\\" also purchase and read \\"Ask & It Is Given\\" [[ASIN:1401904599 Ask and It Is Given: Learning to Manifest Your Desires]] by Esther and Jerry Hicks. While this book is a bit more metaphysical in nature, it includes a number of very practical tools and exercises that enable readers to better understand and more effectively apply the Law of Attraction.

Mitchell's lyrics are not to bring us down, but to make us aware.And to point out to the cellphone zombies, and everyone else in this world with there heads IN the sand, the reality of the condition that our world is in.She does it like no one else can.Musically Mitchell is in top form.\\"Shine\\" has the remanencene of the periods of \\"Blue\\" and \\"For the Roses\\".Her music has gone even further in a direction of creative artistry, continuing to snubb the commercialism so many of us wanted her to continue after a masterpiece like \\"Court and Spark\\". She has found another place to let the artist be in control of there artistry rather than the corporate world doing so.The music flows along on this Cd from song to song like a beautiful stream.Her vocals are in top form,and are where most mature singers of this day would be. Let's face it, Joni's vocals are that of a seasoned jazz singer!It's not 1970 any longer. Even though she does cover her own \\"Big Yellow Taxi (2007)\\", which fits in perfectly on this fine set. The Cd packaging is beautiful, and in this fans opinion, \\"Shine\\" out shines itself. Thank you for coming back Joni! Five stars!

B00005JPTA|2.0|David Cronenberg is without a doubt one of the most unusual directors out there. He makes films that are usually dripping with quality, yet his films are rarely embraced because he has a tenancy to keep the audience at a distance, giving the impression that you are an outside observer as opposed to identifying with the characters. Cronenbergs previous film \\"A History of Violence\\" broke this rule and gave audiences characters to like and relate to. \\"Eastern Promises\\" however returns to the former style of giving us a well made film that doesn't let us embrace it. The revolves around a Russian born woman named Anna Khitrova, who works as a nurse in one of London's most prestige hospitals. One night a pregnant teenager dies on the operating table, bleeding to death but not before giving birth to a baby girl.<br /><br />Anna raids the woman's nurse to find no identification, but only a diary written in Russian, which she can not read. She seeks a translation from a Russian chef named Semyon (Armin Mueller-Sthal), who translates the diary but has reservations about the contents. It turns out the diary revels disturbing information about Semyon, who is actually a big time mob boss for the Vory V Zakone, and he has reservations about some unflattering information that turns up in the diary. He sends one of his henchmen, Nikolai Luzhin, a violent man who has various tattoos all over his body, to keep an eye on her. This is business as usual for Nikolai, but a conflict comes when the notorious killer fears he might be having feelings for Anna. On one hand, he is more kind to her then he needs to be.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is a point where he brutally beats and kills two mobsters in a public bath (in his birthday suit none-the-less). This is all great stuff, and on paper it makes this sound like a potential Best Picture nominee. The problem is the movie is strangely cold and distant, to the point where we watch the movie with a yearning to be more involved in it then we really are. Let's take the bathroom fight I mentioned earlier. It makes sense to talk about this scene since it's the scene that leaves the biggest impression on you when you leave the theater. The fight is brutal. Bloody, violent, with bones snapping, teeth gnashing, shin being cut up. It's difficult to watch, yet there is a craft and skill behind this scene that we've never really seen before in (what is essentially) a street brawl before.<br /><br />I feel this scene will be looked back on as a milestone in film making, as it shows the skill Cronenberg has a director. Yet the problem comes after the fight, where everyone is sort of neutral about the fight. They know what happens, but we don't really get to see them react to the fight. The characters have time to switch between speaking English and Russian throughout the film, but they don't seem to really react to any major events in this film. This puts the minor moments in a bit of a strange place because they too feel soulless, giving you the impression that you are nothing more then...yep, you guessed it: An outside observer. I don't know why Cronenberg decided to film the movie this way, but I can't recommend a movie that is without soul. \\"Eastern Promises\\" is dark, stylish, and intriguing. It's just not emotional, deep, or memorable.<br /><br />Rating: ** and a half starsre. Let's take the bathroom fight I mentioned earlier.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|Martin Scorsese scores big in this documentary on the great Bob Dylan. Interestingly, Scorsese also filmed a documentary in 1978 on The Band's last concert called \\"The Last Waltz\\". The Band were the backing band for Dylan before striking out on their own so this Dylan documentary ties things up nicely.<br /><br />\\"No Direction Home\\" explores Dylan's life and career up until his motorcycle accident in 1966. There are incisive interviews with people he met along the way, rare footage of Dylan on and off stage, and rare and illuminating interviews with the great man himself.<br /><br />This film does much to explain the seemingly inscrutable nature of Dylan. He is definitely his own man and like many great artists he stands outside his own time.<br /><br />The highlight is footage of Dylan singing \\"Mr Tambourine Man\\" at the Newport Festival in July 24, 1964 - just a man by himself on stage with a guitar and harmonica saying nothing and yet saying everything...<br /><br />This is not just for fans but for anybody with a passing interest in Dylan and the tumultuous musical and political world of the late 50s early 60s.<br /><br />As well as the documentary, the DVD also contains full-length versions of some of his \\"live\\" performances between 1963-1966.
B000067IZ3|4.0|While people are currently complaining that we are fighting a foreign war that we have no way of winning, there is in fact a homeland war that is looking just as grim that gets far less media attention. That war is the war on drugs, a war that is examined in all different angles in Steven Soderbergh's exceptionally brilliant \\"Traffic.\\" \\"Traffic\\" covers drugs from beginning to end. While \\"Crash\\" and \\"Babel\\" may have ultimately brought the craft of hyperlink storytelling to popularity, it was \\"Traffic\\" that originally perfected the art of telling a single narrative through different perspectives. We get to see the drugs shipped from Mexico to America, we get to see the drug dealers explain their side of the story, we get to see the congressmen who are attempting to fight drugs, and we finally get to see teenagers who use the drugs themselves.<br /><br />It's mind boggling to see how much of an impact drugs really have on our culture and on the lives of our fellow man. Soderbergh filmed \\"Traffic\\" on a digital camera of things, which gives the movie the look of a home video. The color tones also differ from character to character, demonstrating the mood they're currently in. For example, a cop in Mexico is surrounded in a glow of orange, giving the viewer a feeling of what viewing Mexico for the first time is like. Then we look through the eyes of a teenage girl who is taking drugs, and the world looks hazy and blue, except for light which seems to be brighter then it should be. It's a great stylistic choice, one that benefits the film and makes it look as fresh and inventive today as it did seven years ago. But my goodness, I must be out of my mind.<br /><br />I haven't even discussed the storyline with you yet, and here I am jumping into the art of the film making. I think this is the first (as my brother calls them) \\"talking drama\\" film I actually did this on. And now that I've dipped in with a small analyst of the film making, I want to point out that the acting is excellent. Michael Douglas as Congressman Robert Wakefield particularly stands out as the congressman who goes to congress meetings pitching his plans to enforce the war on drugs, only to run into a conflict when he discovers his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is a drug addict herself. Benicio del Toro may have walked away with the Oscar for his portrayal of the conflicted Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez, but in my eyes Michael Douglas steals this movie right out from all the other actors.<br /><br />Though I must admit, Don Cheadle comes dangerously close as Montel Gordon, a man who has captured a key witness who's testimony could send a major drug lord to jail for life. His witness singles out the husband of Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is shocked to discover this secret life her husband has been living (which has supplied the income she never really questioned before), but feels compelled to get involved in the business after her son is threatened by another drug lord. All of these stories could be their own movie, yet \\"Traffic\\" roles them all into one very effectively. These storylines contribute to each other so beautifully, that it's like watching a well-made documentary (which, ironically, is also what the film looks like thanks to Soderbergh's digital camera technique).<br /><br />\\"Traffic\\" caused considerable amount of controversy when it was nominated for five Academy Awards. Of the five \\"Traffic\\" took home four, including Oscars for Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor (I guess I should also mention it won for Best Editing, seeing as how sub-par editing could have easily killed this film). The only Oscar it did not win was Best Picture, which went to Ridley Scott's \\"Gladiator.\\" Yes, I know people tend to accuse the Academy Awards for taking themselves too seriously, but at least this year the Academy members shut their brains off and gave the Best Picture award to one of those brainless action movies average movie goers constantly (and ignorantly) claim are better then Oscar winning films like \\"Casablanca\\" and \\"Titanic.\\"<br /><br />Even if you LIKED \\"Gladiator\\" there's no denying that \\"Gladiators\\" film quality is certainly not on the same level as \\"Traffics\\" is, and it's certainly not as memorable. Yeah, I know the two films are different, and thus should be exempt from comparison, but seeing as how both films are actually two and a half hours long, I find it interesting when people compliment \\"Traffic\\" for feeling \\"half as long\\" as it's advertised, where with \\"Gladiator\\" I've never heard people comment on the film feeling short then it really is. People who do watch \\"Traffic\\" compliment the unique style of filming in the movie, but with \\"Gladiator\\" they only seem interested that the movie looked cool. \\"Traffic\\" is a classic film that is just as relevant today as it was seven years ago. It's still daring today, it's still important today, and it's still just as fascinating today.

0307120007|1.0|I thought this would have been a great book for my infant/toddler, but was very disappointed because it is not a sturdy board book.  Instead, it is a regular paper back book with slightly thicker pages.  This book requires extra gentle care and is not good for children at a stage where they want to touch and feel the book, as the title suggests.
0743496728|4.0|Wow!  Jodi Picoult has done it again.  I think this is one of her better books.  She tackles a very difficult and emotional subject and she does so with wonderful sensitivity.  This book is so real, I felt as if I truly knew the characters and was right there alongside them.  I found myself crying on a few occasions.   She tells the story from many different points of view and bounces back and forth through time.  As with most of her books, there is a \\"twist\\" at the end.  I do have to say, though, that I would have liked to see a slightly different ending.  I will not say much more as I do not want to spoil it for those that have not read it.   This book is a must read!

At four months he still enjoys this book over most of his other books.
B000065VB0|3.0|Let's be honest folks Gabriel is not as great as he has been made out to be. Actually, I think Banks' solo outings are more interesting and that is not saying much. I do like Games without frontiers and I like the progressive vibe throughout some of the songs. But, overall this is minimalistic garbage that somehow attracted an audience. I really can't understand why Phil and Pete became so popular. Both put out some of the most banal lacking music of the 80s and 90s. At least we still have their wonderful work of the 70s.
0385522401|4.0|This is in some ways an odd little book--it seems almost as if McEwan has given us with \\"On Chesil Beach\\" a fragment from some larger piece of work.  It is quite short--quite intense and detailed about the period of time dealing with the marriage at the center of it all, but almost dismissive, and certainly distant, about the subsequent lives of the husband and wife.  (The epilogue seems unsatisfyingly unbalanced to me because we do not hear very much, with one exception, about what direction the young wife's emotional life took. What, if she allowed herself to make anything of it all, did she make of this experience as she aged?)<br /><br />The thing I most enjoyed about the book was the tenderness with which McEwan dealt with both the newlyweds, and how beautifully fleshed out they both were.  The reader therefore understands them both far better than they are able to understand each other, hampered as they are by both the limitations imposed on them by their particular family circumstances as well as the conventionality of the period. (Among other things, I think it is pretty clear that Florence has been abused by her father.) And this makes it so very painful when things go wrong, as they do.  I kept thinking, as Edmund and Florence must have themselves in later years, \\"if only\\"...<br /><br />There are explicit sexual scenes in the novel, but they are far from sensational in nature, and seem totally organic to the development of the characters.<br /><br />If you enjoy a really character-driven novel, I think \\"On Chesil Beach\\" will please you.
031286504X|5.0|This book is a real page turner and an absolute horror classic. I am familiar with quite a bit of Matheson's work and it is excellent. I am Legend is in a class by itself. I think this one will be remembered as a literary classic in the future like Dracula and Frankenstein. Highly recommended.
0316010669|5.0|In the blink of an eye we gather huge amounts of information. The author, Gladwell, likens our brains to giant computers capable of processing lots of data in a flash. I found it fascinating how we can use this information either for survival purposes and / or we can apply our intuitive knowledge to any given situation. The author coins the term \\"thin slicing\\" to explain the process of applying one's intuition. He states that we are often suspicious of trusting this intuition because it's so quick and easy, even when it's on target. He relays experiments where instantaneous \\"thin slicing\\" has amazing results, sometimes in life and death situations, but also explains what can cause the skillto fall short. The reason often being that we are not truly living in the present moment.    Two books that easily guide one into the present moment are Ariel and Shya Kane's \\"Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment\\" and \\"How To Create A Magical Relationship\\". These refreshingly fun and practical books effortlessly get the reader into the present moment where enlightenment resides. In an instant life can become brilliant and magical. Both of these intelligent books have shown me that life needn't be hard work in order to be amazing.
015603283X|4.0|The Club Dumas is a good read for anyone who has read The Flemish Panel by the same author.  Both books are dark in mood but they will keep you engrossed.  They are definitely not your typical mystery stories, but who wants a typical mystery story anyway.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|This is a SERIOUS niche film: the third installment of a zombie film based on Capcom's \\"Resident Evil\\" games. Talk about a narrow audience! And, even as a member of this small group, I entered the film with low-expectations (it is always difficult to please this type of viewer). Sure, I was thrilled to see the addition of Ali Larter (Final Destination, Final Destination 2 and \\"Heroes\\"), but I refused to allowed myself hope.    Maybe this is why I found the film a pleasant surprise (yes, it had its rough areas ... I'll address that in a second). The premise is relevant (the world has been completely ravaged by the T-virus, the entire planet is an acrid wasteland of undead). The writing is clever (plenty of unpredictabilities ... even down to a guy who can predict the contents of label-less canned-goods ... odd talent). The acting is convincing (some reviewers here found Jovovich's acting \\"wooden\\" ... I feel like they may have forgotten that the storyline dictates she is no longer entirely human). The setting is fantastic (so perfectly desolate). The cinematography is impressive (gorgeous color! very saturated!). For me, there is very little TECHNICALLY about which to complain. In fact, I was thoroughly engaged from start to finish. For me, it was gratifyingly tense (especially the scenes in Las Vegas)!!    Rough areas. Okay, let's delve into some of the deeper issues. I was a little perturbed that the heroes of the film were all women ... especially when these women are desperate to transport a group of children to an uninfected area. It is, perhaps, a little too obvious. Yes, Oded Fehr reprises his role as Carlos, but it is pretty clear that Claire (Larter) and Alice (Jovovich) are the leaders (I mean, Claire's team is NAMED after her AND she is their tactician). Likewise, that all members of the Umbrella Corporation council are male is equally as frustrating. I would have liked to have seen a little balance here. Similarly, the treatment of the sole black male lead(L. J. played by Mike Epps) was disconcerting. Rather than provide huge spoilers, I will only note one small aspect of his character that may prove disappointing: his \\"smoking\\" habit. At first blush, this seems amusing, but ultimately it can be viewed as little other than stereotypical (still, Epps does wonderfully in his role ... I do not want there to be any confusion about that!) But, these troublesome areas were not glaring enough to pull me out the film. These were thoughts for the ride home.    All of this aside, maybe I'm not the best person to persuade you one way or the other. I've been a gamer since I was five, I've been a zombie (zombi) enthusiast since I was eight, and I've always loved Capcom's \\"Resident Evil\\" series. So, I guess I'm not particularly unbiased. What you need to do to enjoy this film: you should have seen Resident Evil and Resident Evil - Apocalypse (for your sake and those around you), you should love zombie films (hey, who doesn't?!), and should dig gaming (so that you can look at your friend and say \\"BOSS FIGHT!\\"). If you fail to meet this criteria you may still enjoy the work, but I have a feeling you will only be frustrated.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I have to confess, I could not be more surprised by the quality of this movie. After a very disappointing Rocky V, I decided that I was just going to watch this final film for the sake of completeness, but I expected it to be a bad, or at best a neutral, experience. To my surprise, the end of the saga is really good, with a nicely built story, and a movie which provides the whole journey with an elegant symmetry.<br /><br />Adrian has died, victim to cancer, and Rocky owns a restaurant that is successful only by virtue of the fame of its owner. Patrons visit the establishment looking for a first-hand story, or a picture, or an autograph. Meanwhile, Rocky's son is trying to make it in the corporate world, but is having a tough time dealing with being a celebrity's son. This in turn puts a strain in the relationship with his father that takes a big toll on Rocky. When a computer simulated fight between the current heavyweight champion and the old hero takes place on Sportscenter, with a controversial result, the door opens for the return of the people's champion.<br /><br />I am extremely glad I was wrong about this film, since this provides a classy ending to one of the best collection of sports movies of all time. Stallone delivers a much better performance than I expected after watching him being a guest in Monday Night Football. He has some restrictions in terms of facial expressions, but this does works well with the character, and he provides the needed level of passion and energy. Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Robert Jr., also adds to the quality of this movie, since he is right on target with his performance, portraying the inner conflicts of his character masterfully. The final fight might not be the best we have seen in this series of movies, but it is definitely adequate.<br /><br />Anyone that has been following the Rocky movies needs to watch this final installment. And please, if you were discouraged by the dreadful Rocky V, do not be afraid, this new movie will definitely make it up to you.it up to you.
B000J103N4|5.0|The richness and depth of this album will ensure an appreciative audience long into the future, regardless of the ever-changing tastes of consumers.  Alternatingly ethereal and hard-driving, it was, and is, outside the mainstream.  Production values are as top-notch as the creative effort that Crosby invested in this project.  It seems that, musically, Crosby was ahead of his time in the way that he dramatically combined world and liturgical influences into his compositions.  A+
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|This is a powerful movie that captures the genuine spirit of honest individualism and honesty itself through Ayn Rand's \\"alternate reality\\" of fiction. Most of all, it captures my personal struggle and overcoming in life of trials and tribulations, that spirit-force that drives all productive, honest, creative men and women to live great lives. It does bring that beautiful, brash, exciting novel to life in every genuine way and sense that counts.
1594489505|3.0|I loved Kite Runner (KR) and was anxious to read A Thousand Splendid Suns (ATSS). Like KR, ATSS provided a terrific history lesson of a country that most of us Americans know only through the news headlines and sound-bites.  It was an incredible view through the eyes of two women, Mariam and Laila, who's lives are interwined.<br /><br />The other reviews tell you a lot about the story and these women, so I won't repeat it. While it was a compelling story and I was grateful for the the historial information, it dragged on for a little too long.  I thought Kite Runner was a better book.

0743496728|5.0|I picked up \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" by Jodi Picoult after a conversation with a co-worker.  She was a big fan of Picoult, but had not yet read this book.  I picked it up on Friday and finished it on Tuesday, after several late evenings.    \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" tells the story of a bullied young man who decides to take matters into his own hands after the school administration and his parents don't provide the help he needs.  It is also the story of his parents, a girl who used to be his friends, and her mother, who was once friend's with the shooter's mother.  Using a flashback, flash forward story-telling method, Picoult tells the present events and the previous events that led to the tragedy.    While most of the other reviews that I have read about Picoult say that she has utilizes \\"pat\\" endings, I was very surprised at the end of this book.  In fact, I was in tears as the final chapters rolled around.    I think this particular story struck a nerve with me because I am an educator by profession, studying to become a principal.  The main issue in this book was bullying and that is, unfortunately, something that is dealt with by many students every day.  While the book is graphic in some areas, it is a book that I would recommend for all educators to read, not just for the entertainment value, but also for the insight that Picoult provides into the feelings of bullied children.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|[[ASIN:B0000AUHPK Wuthering Heights (1992)]]<br /><br />This is the first film production that entails both generations of the Earnshaws and Lintons.  As a Graduate student of English, I am very familiar with the text and I find this version is adequate and fascinating.  Ralph Fiennes utilizes his ever-charismatic talent for drama to pull-off the complex and dark Heathcliff character. Binoche gives and exceptional \\"I am Heathcliff\\" speech.  I was able to follow the text along with the movie's scenes.  There are some variations, and I am biased since I stand forthright in my allegiance to text rather than film.  One of the main aspects of Heathcliff's character in the text is his envy for the blue eyes of Linton and Fiennes' blue eyes are a bit distracting in the movie.  The film industry has yet to really apply the physical description of Heathcliff to film version.  But, this version is perfectly tuned into the Gothic and dreary features of the text.
B00005JPRD|2.0|Where to start?  There are so many things to dislike about this film, I hardly know how to start.  It's a bad film, but not like BLOODRAYNE II or BENCHWARMERS is a bad movie.  It's been made by committed, creative people who somehow missed actually stepping back and seeing that what they were making was silly, ludicrous and often quite boring.    Why did I give it 2 stars?  Well, the one truly great thing about the film is that it reconvinced me that the music of The Beatles is a miracle...that it can stand the test of time in a way that no other \\"pop/rock\\" music can.  So that was good.  And I suppose it will turn a lot of the current teen generation on to the Beatles...I just hope they go out and listen to the real stuff.  Then they'll realize just how bad some of the renditions in ACROSS THE UNIVERSE are.    Full disclosure time:  I'm a 44 year old man, who saw the movie with my 44 year old wife and 15 year old daughter.  The theatre was quite full (about 85%) and many, many teenagers were there...that was heartening.  My daughter liked it alot...my wife liked it okay.  All I could muster when it was over was \\"At least I stayed awake.\\"  So I understand a lot of people won't agree with my assesment.    The \\"story\\" follows a British \\"lad\\" named Jude, who in the early '60s leaves his Liverpool home to sneak into America to try to find the father who unknowingly left his mother pregnant when he was in Britain during WWII.  Jude meets up with Maxwell (Max) at Princeton.  Max is the unruly child of wealth and the two become fast friends.  Max drops out of school (naturally, since this is the Vietnam era, and being in college protected you from the draft...wouldn't YOU drop out of college just because it \\"wasn't for you.\\") and Max takes his new best buddy to Greenwich Village.  There they rent a room from Sadie, a Janis Joplin type.  Their crew is soon joined by Prudence, a lesbian from Ohio, Jo Jo (a Jimi Hendrix type) and most importantly, Lucy.  Lucy is Max's sister,who is coming to \\"spend the summer\\" with her brother, because she is grieving over the death of her boyfriend in Vietnam.  She gets over her grief awfully fast, because of course she falls for Jude...who returns the affections.    The rest of the movie basically shows us the totally overworked, cliched view of the Village as America's heartland of music, drugs and Vietnam protest.  Every idea about the village that is presented has been done millions of times before.  The whole concept is not informed by real life, but by the filmmakers' remembrance of how the village always looked in other, far better movies.  You wonder if any of the people who made the movie had ever been to New York City.  Naturally, the all take psychedelic drugs and we get lots of scenes straight out of a '70s exploitation movie, with swirling reds and greens and images of bodies floating through mult-colored water smooching.      Relationships struggle, the war protests grow more violent and the movie gets more and more laughable.    But what of the music?  Well, early on, I had hope.  The film starts with our young Jude sitting on a lonely Liverpool beach, singing simply to the camera the opening lines of \\"Girl.\\"  His voices aches, but he has a mischievous smile too.  I thought, \\"okay, this isn't bad...the song fits.\\"  (Later, you come to realize that this young actor [in a BAD wig] can't really sing anything any other way...so you hear lots of slow aching renditions of songs that needed more texture.)  We also see a scene bouncing back and forth from UK to US of teenage kids dancing to cover bands performing \\"Hold Me Tight.\\"  That was good.  But once we hear Jude achingly, slowly sing \\"All My Loving,\\" it's pretty much over.  Soon after, we see Prudence, a cheerleader in Ohio, slooooowly singing \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" to the crush who will never return her love. When we first realized that she's singing about a fellow cheerleader and not the hunky football player, the audience burst out inlaughter...not the good kind, either.  (Prudence would prove to be the worst character in the film..and the inspiration for a STUPID rendition of \\"Dear Prudence.\\")    \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" was centered around an unimaginative night of partying with Max, Jude and Max's fellow rich, lazy Princeton classmates.  Much later, Max is inducted into the army, and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" is used as a setting for a strange anti-war kinda thing in which all the soldiers wear creepy masks and the line \\"She's So Heavy\\" shows a group of recent inductees carrying a gigantic statue of liberty through a Vietnamish landscape.  Oh, and \\"I Want You\\" is sung by an animated Uncle Sam on an induction poster.  I found it all \\"heavy\\"-handed, recycled and vaguely offensive as an American.  Other \\"winners\\" include Jude's gutless \\"Revolution,\\" Eddie Izzard's head-scratchingly weird take on \\"For The Benefit of Mr. Kite,\\" and Sadie's Janis-Joplin take on \\"Helter Skelter.\\"  The Beatles totally rocked that song, and yet somehow, Sadie's backup band is hardly heard in the film, and the song looses the insane nature of what Paul McCartney had meant to show that the Beatles could do a head-banging song (not that they called it head-banging in the '60s...but you know what I mean.)    Were there NO good song renditions?  Okay, I admit some were okay.  \\"I've Seen A Face,\\" set in a bowling alley, was actually fun, but it felt inspired by (or ripped-off) musicals like GREASE.  Bono singing \\"I Am The Walrus\\" reminded me how nice having a singer who actually knew how to sell a song is...even though much of the scene was generic psychedelic dribble.  Joe Cocker sang a decent \\"Come Together\\" although he didn't need any screen-time, with his heavily made-up face and cliched pimp clothes.      Julie Taymor, the \\"creator\\" of this movie, is best known for her Broadway staging of THE LION KING.  She clearly has deep theatrical roots...but her sense of film is missing.  Many scenes feel like atheatrical staging, not a film staging.  And the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes long...to much for such fluff.  Yes, it's fluff, even though it wants so badly to be taken seriously.  It feels way, way too much like everyone thought all the time...\\"oooh, aren't we clever, we worked in a joke about 'She Came In Through The Bathroom Window'?\\"  Also, the movie fails because almost every person in it is a terrible actor.  Even Evan Rachel Wood, the experience young actress who plays Lucy,is unlikeable.  She's a heartless brat most of the time.    All that being said, I know others will respond to the movie totally differently.  So I'm not saying YOU shouldn't go...just that I wish I hadn't.  If you do go...I hope you enjoy it more.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|It was exciting news to discover that David Fincher, director of such films as Fight Club, Panic Room, The Game and the masterpiece, Se7en was the director of the film Zodiac, the serial killer (publicly claimed 13 victims, police pinned him to five) who sent codes and frightening notes to major newspapers during the late sixties and seventies and, strangely was never apprehended. Zodiac is a very good film but unfortunately not one of Fincher's best.<br /><br />The film is based on the best selling book by Robert Graysmith and the author is played in the film with skill by actor Jake Gyllenhaal. The character of Graysmith is portrayed as a bookish, stumbling nerd-type though as the film progresses; the character becomes obsessed with solving or identifying the Zodiac killer, and with this growing obsession becomes much more confident. Gyllenhaal (Rendition, Jarhead, and Broken Mountain) is a fine actor and played this character with subtlety and believability - a great performance.<br /><br />Robert Downey Junior as the chain smoking hard drinking rebellious journalist, Paul Avery, seemed to be a step down for this fine actor. If this isn't type casting, then I don't know what is...Downey's personal life has been rough, some would say unfair, but as his agent, I would have suggested he turn down this role merely because he has played this \\"type\\" many times, however he does it very well and to work with Fincher would be hard to resist.<br /><br />The role of Inspector Toschi was superbly played by Mark Ruffalo (Collateral, In the Cut) and was certainly up to this actors high standards.<br /><br />As said many times, it is a mistake to walk into a film with any expectations, because one way or another, they'll be dashed in some respect.<br /><br />David Fincher is famous (some would say infamous) for his attention to detail, this film is no different. But it lacked, for me, that intense atmosphere which most of his other films have: Se7en, Fight Club and Panic Room. That said, Zodiac moves quickly riveting one's attention and overall very entertaining.g one's attention and overall very entertaining.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|I love movies about alternate possibilities, time travelesque stories, alternating time lines.  Some Films of recent come to mind such as Deja Vu, Premenition, even the sappy romance of the Lake house.  I would even like to mention one of my personal favorites although utterly fantastic in a quantum physics way is Grand tour: Disaster in Time with Jeff Danials.  I missed Next in the Theater to many other blockbusters playing on multiple screens phased this action thriller off the big screen very quickly.  I thought the concept for this film (based on the story by Philip K. Dick) was very cool.  Chris Johnson aka Frank Cadillac (Cage) is a fortune telling magic act in vegas, who can also see 2 minutes into the future of his own life.  And if you can see the future you can change the present. Johnsons life of scamming the black jack tables and slot machines changes when the feds take notice of his abilities.  Incidently the opening sequence after Johnson foils a shooting in the casino(an incident the may have happened if Johnson had just let the event unfold as it did in his premonition) leads casino security on a cat and mouse through the casino watching johnson manuveur going on a 2 minute lead into the future to perfect timed escapes and dodges was more impressive then watching tom cruise duck authorities with the Pre-cog in Minority report.    Johnson can only see 2 minutes into the future until he meets Liz(Beil), a fateful meeting based on a unusual premonition.  For some reason, that is never explained in this film he is able to see further into the future when he is in her presence. If you can just accept that as the way it is I think you'll enjoy this movie better.    Thrills come hard and fast as Cage dodges the feds and foreign terrorists that have taken a nuclear munitions cache. which is why the feds want Johnson, to use his abilities to find said cache before it detonates.  Johnson cheats death numerous times along with a few embarrassing situations whenhe first meets Liz, as you see all the possibilites he initiates before choosing the one that works.  Next delivers the goods as far as thrills and shootem up action, and as a treat there is a little bit of a surprise before the end of the film which blew my mind, not a mind blowing as the end of the Sixth Sense, but still pretty cool.  Coolest special effect in this film is watching Johnson split apart from himself, creating multiple versions to check out all the possiblities of his surrounding and which way to go. And dodging bombs, snipers and other close shaves.  Jessica beil is absolutely gorgeous as Liz(no surprise) a very girl next door type.  Julianne moore plays lead persuing FBI agent.  This movie was entertaining despite some of the criticisms from mainstream magazines whose biggest complaint about Next was Nicolas Cages' Lame hairdo. Please, Next is suppose to be a science fiction/fantasy of coarse theres going to be some inconsistencies(like Cage being old enough to be Beils Father), but to that all I have to say is...Time Cop!  Bottom Line....Entertaining. Would have given this one more star, but I feel the film could have been at least a half hour longer to resolve things.

B000QQFKYE|4.0|You either love David Lynch or you hate him, and if you are a fan of Lynch, you'll either love Inland Empire, or you won't.  Filmed entirely digitally (Lynch fell in love with the technique prior to making the film), Inland Empire finds Lynch re-teaming with his Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart star Laura Dern.  Dern plays struggling actress Nikki Grace, who has just gotten a big time role as the adulterous Susan Blue, and soon enough her own life starts to mirror the life of the role she is playing, and as secrets of the film's sordid history unfold, Lynch takes us on a dizzying, identity crisis-fueled trip.  Clocking in at three hours, Inland Empire is by far Lynch's most indulgent film to date, and because of the running time and Lynch's own absurdist film techniques, devoted Lynch fans may have a tough time getting all the way through.  However, Lynch's techniques are also what make Inland Empire worth seeing, and Dern shines as well, who it's great to see once again in a starring role.  Jeremy Irons is on board as the film's director, and he's here all too brief.  Lynch regulars Justin Theroux, Harry Dean Stanton, and Laura Harring (in a cameo) are here as well, but Dern is the real star of Lynch's twisted show.  The special features are actually worth seeing, and there's some insightful features from Lynch to boot.  All in all, Inland Empire isn't always coherent or easy to decipher (and that's saying it lightly), but it's pure Lynch all the way, and many of his hardcore fans will not be disappointed.

I purposely read it as slow as possible to delay the ineveitable ending, and the only part I am disappointed in is the fact it ended at all. I even convinced my boyfriend to read it, and he has only read a few books in his lifetime... And all of them were part of the Dark Elf series.

B00005KHEU|3.0|Seriously: This is Jeff Lynne apeing the brothers Gibb. I remember the faint strains of Saturday Night Fever echoing in the caverns of my mind! 'Billy was a mountain/Ethel was a tree hanging over his shoulder'(1971 FZ) 9-29. Today is 9-29 \\"Last Train To London.\\" Ah...technology. ELO was always....Er..Jeff Lynne seems to be always ahead of the curve. I submit in some cases. The ELO remasters are - fantastic!    This archaic dinosaur is highly interesting, nevertheless. I always thought ELO was strictly a singles band; Avoided them from the early-mid-Seventies like The Black Death. Was impressed with ELO II when it came out. Bought it. It sat unplayed. So did DP's Machine Head. So what? As did Boulders, as did Message From The Country. So what?    I patently agree ELO = Jeff Lynne. I qualify that statement by saying from On The Third Day it is. The Magnificent Roy Wood left early. So what?  This is in sum a better album than its overtly commercial single: \\"Dont' Bring Me Down\\" indicates; Yet following the mamouth Out Of The Blue; what was one to do? I still think The Gibb Brothers were uncredited. RIP Maurice.    I still think that the liner notes of the recently released ELO remasters  portray Jeff Lynne as a benevolent dictator. He probably wasn't. Was he?  Topping OOTB was tough. In that  sense it is a let down.    Still Discovery is different enough to reward.    Still; Despite the Beatle-esqe/Bee Gees 70's overt influences. The Beatles never would've evolved into this Zappa-esque/comic/1970's disco Bee Gees sound. The Move? Yes, probably.
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|I think this CD is alright - I find myself listening to it and enjoying it, but I can't help but to think somewhat of Good Charlotte in metal when I listen to this. And along with the hardcore scream as well. It's a bit more emoish/hardcore as well, but I can't really consider this real metal, but metalcore. Don't get me wrong, I still think that this CD is a good listen, but I can't listen to it on repeat for a while because it sounds like I'm listening to emo-metal.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|This is a movie with an excellent premise, good actors, and fine directing, and one that should be seen by all who can not appreciate the quality of other human beings. And for those that do. It shows the potential for relationships between any two or more unlike individuals anywhere. My wife and I were impressed with Rob Brown's debut performance on the big screen. I was curious and was pleased to find he later starred in six movies since the filming of Forrester. The action moves purposefully, did not lag, and ended with a positive conclusion. The only problem I found was some excessive bad language. Because of this, I can recommend it for all adults, and only for a family with teen plus years, but not with younger children. This review was based on a VHS video from my private collection.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden's comeback album with Bruce back on the vox was 2000's \\"Brave New World\\" - back with the classic Maiden sound with a progressive touch to them! A lot of these songs run about 5-7 minutes long! If you're a fan of Iron Maiden and even progressive metal, get this!
B000002UBB|2.0|Once upon a time, Steve Miller was a musical force - though at the time, he got little airplay.  From \\"Children of the Future\\" through \\"Number 5\\", the Steve Miller Band made great music.<br /><br />The came a troubled period, followed by \\"The Joker\\".  With this album, he set his sights on breaking the Top 40, and while he succeeded, it was hardly admirable work (not an uncommon tale among those who trade respect for profit).<br /><br />\\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" continues that pattern of pandering to the lowest common denominator - a pattern he seems determined to maintain.<br /><br />If you'd like to know what the man is actually capable of, I recommend \\"Sailor\\", \\"Brave New World\\", or \\"Your Saving Grace\\" (sadly, out-of-print).
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I hear so many hardcore A7X fans saying how much this album sucks, but I know it's because they're used to the emo-ish hardcore type A7X in their first 2 albums, but me personally being a more metal fan and metal-guitar fan this is the best A7X album in my opinion. Gone are the hardcore screams, and the Good Charlotte-esque melodies and choruses, and in are the classic heavy metal melodies and a more technical shred-like guitar style. Now this is more of metal than Avenged Sevenfold's old stuff, not metalcore. If you want to wish away metalcore, emo, and hardcore influences, you'll like this Avenged Sevenfold.    You have to listen to \\"The Wicked End\\" for all you guitar fans, that dual-guitar riff in the intro and between the verse and chorus is just...well, WICKED!!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I had my doubts about this album as I thought it was just another greatest hits or soething like that. Little did I know that George Martin was part of the project. He did an amazing job, the 5.1 mix cant get any better.
0375931007|4.0|I agree with the other reviews both the good and the bad. I have read alot of books about WW2 and the Holocaust, so I think the subject matter held my interest throughout the book. It might have been a hard read for me otherwise. Also some books have more of an entertaining value, and others carry a message that sometimes can be so deep that it is hard to totally appreciate the author's intent. For this exact reason, at times I was frustrated, because I knew that Zusak was trying to portray a deeper meaning then I was grasping.     I however did appreciate the heart that Liesel and the Hubermann's had for the Jewish people. I have not come across many books that address German's hiding Jews, so I found that interesting.  I also appreciated the emphasis that was put on the power of words.  Finally, I think that Zusak did a great job on developing each character!  He himself is very good with words.    Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject matter, and who likes a lot of depth in a book. If not, try Anne Frank, The Hiding Place, or even the Zion Covenant Series by Brock and Bodie Theone.
1582701709|1.0|S. Winters \\"anastasia35\\" (Salt Lake City) -      . . . By far the most offensive part of the message is the suggestion that people who have pain in their lives are somehow attracting it with their thoughts. Darfur rape victims did not ask for it. Children who are molested did not ask for it. Starving Africans did not ask for it. To suggest that their \\"incorrect thinking\\" is the cause of this is sickening. Positive thoughts may help you endure pain, and help you find meaning in it, but it will not end random violence, illness and war. Shame on anyone who tells a sick person that they are manifesting it themselves, that they don't want to get well badly enough.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|This was the first cd I purchased of John's and I am very happy. Have to say after skimming through his other cd's this is probably one of his best in my opinion. I did enjoy some cuts from Heavier Things as well but this one I give two thumbs up all day long.
B000002W35|4.0|Make Me Know It, the first track here and written by Otis Blackwell, was the first one he recorded after leaving the army, done in Nashville on March 20, 1960. The following month he covered the 1956 Peggy Lee hit Fever, a slow breathy rendition accompanied by a softl-beating drum, and also recorded The Girl Of My Best Friend. Co-written by Beverly Ross of Ronald & Ruby Lollipop fame (she also wrote Dim Dim The Lights for Bill Haley, Judy's Turn To Cry for Leslie Gore, and Roy Orbison's Candy Man), here his melancholy delivery is backed by The Jordanaires, Two years later, his sound-a-like Ral Donner would have a hit with it.<br /><br />Another done at that time was the full-length duet with Charlie Hodge on  one of my favourites from the album, the slow bluesy I Will Be Home Again, as is the up-tempo Lieber-Stoller composition, Dirty, Dirty Feeling which features Hank Garland on guitar, along with Scotty, Bob Moore, D.J. and the piano of Floyd Cramer. On Thrill Of Your Love, written by Stanley Kessler, Elvis alternates between going full bore, and then laying back, to produce a most unusual track. while Soldier Boy was recorded at the same time as Make Me Know It.<br /><br />Such A Night is a classic written by Lincoln Chase, husband of, and producer for, Shirley Ellis, and first performed in 1954 by The Drifters, with Clyde McPhatter on lead, as well as Johnny Ray, and was actually banned at the time by certain radio stations for its \\"suggestive\\" lyrics.  Which, of course, put it in immediate demand! Here Elvis is clearly having a ball panting his way through the song. Another recorded at that first session after leaving the army was It Feels So Right, a raspy delivery that seems just right for the lyrics.<br /><br />A bit of fluff is next, as the Jordanires back him with \\"doo-waa-doos\\" on The Girl Next Door, but not so the final two tunes. Like A Baby, written by orchestra leader Jesse Stone, has the Boots Randolph sax wailing as Elvis delivers the words to this blues tune as only he can, much as he does on Lowell Fulson's Reconsider Baby where he growls his way through as Randolph's sax adds some punch.<br /><br />One of his best LPs ever. I just wish, as I have said before, that RCA/BMG would have seen fit to provide liner notes, which are completely lacking, along with a complete discography of the contents.n, much as he does on Lowell Fulson's Reconsider Baby where he growls his way through as Randolph's sax adds some punch.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This DVD set is the best I've ever seen. It's so realistic, the sound, picture quality & presentation are just great. Highly recommended. You get so much into the film that, you think you're standing there at some point.
B000002W8O|5.0|To reviewer Bon Jovi Fan a bit of history. This CD release contains the exact songs that appeared on the first Elvis' Christmas Album, released in 1957 on RCA Victor LOC-1035. The one you recall with the same title was released in 1970 on RCA Camden CAL-2428, containing a mix of some of the earlier tracks with new ones, including If Every Day Was Like Christmas. Written by Red West, it was recorded on June 11, 1966 in Nashville and first released that year as a single b/w How Would You Like To Be?<br /><br />As another reviewer points out, this one, when first released, became the target of that element of society self-righteously \\"scandalized\\" by the \\"vulgar hip-swinging degenerate\\" who was \\"corrupting our children\\" led by the son of C&W legend Hank Snow, one Jimmie Rodgers Snow, the most pious of them all. In other words, those yabos who were doing all they could to kill R&R at birth. Of course, the R&R DJs, when playing anything from the album, had zeroed in on tunes like Blue Christmas (which actually dates back to 1949 by Ernest Tubb, Russ Morgan, and Hugo Winterhalter) and Lieber & Stoller's driving Santa Claus Is Back In Town.<br /><br />Only when they eventually heard his mellow tones on White Christmas and I'll Be Home For Christmas, the carols Silent Night and Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem, and the four gospel tunes included (especially Take My Hand, Precious Lord), did some of them - not all, mind you, but a few - admit that they had perhaps over-reacted. Snow, thankfully, just faded into obscurity.<br /><br />The sound reproduction is excellent, and although there are no liner notes with the insert, you do get nine pages of vintage colour photographs of Elvis. No collection of Christmas music is complete without this one.
B000M3452Y|5.0|Having possessed it since early this year, I can clearly and very surely state that Sound of Silver is my favorite record of the year. Of it's nine tracks - Only one (the title track) is not very good. \\"New York I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down\\" and \\"Time to Get Away\\" are great songs that are only lessened by their inclusion with other greater songs.    The six that remain: \\"Get Innocuous!\\" - \\"North American Scum\\" - \\"Someone Great\\" - \\"All My Friends\\" - \\"Us vs. Them\\" and \\"Watch the Tapes\\" are supreme masterpieces of dance music from our era.     James Murphy blends complex, infectious and original dance music with expert structures that are just designed to apex at the most cathartic and beautiful moment.    He sounds like no one and yet he takes from everyone. No one does live band dance music like this anymore; he is hyper-intelligent dance, grooving with polish and talent that can't be contained be any genre. Murphy's version of \\"dance\\" can argue dance' music's implied physicality as a superior reaction to all other emotion implied by music.    How best to express your relationship to a song than be overcome by the urge to bouncing around mindlessly to it?    Combining this with the success of his previous singles \\"Tribulations\\" and \\"Disco Infiltrator\\" (which haven't aged a goddamn day and still sound leagues ahead of everybody) - It is safe to say that Mr. Murphy and his Liquid Crystal Display Soundsystem will be considered hallmarks of musical achievement in our time.    Seriously, buy this album. You won't regret it.
B000JU7NCE|3.0|This DVD is far inferior to The Cure's \\"Trilogy\\" DVD. This DVD is poorly filmed, and the special effects graphics on some of the songs are annoying. Still, if you're a true Cure fan, this DVD is worth owning.
1932907009|5.0|This IS a book about writing incredibly formulaic screenplays period. For my likes and dislikes, I would refer to Blake's movie ideas as groaners. That said, I find this book to be INCREDIBLY HELPFUL, amazing, on laying out that Hollywood 'movie' formula. It's great for creating structure. I'm not expecting this book to make me a more intersting storyteller. But I've worked with a number of hugely successful film producers / directors, and for the most part, they comletely rely on formula. Now, it's YOUR job to make that intersting. It's your job to know HOW breaking that formula makes your idea work better. It's all really valuable information. Do other books cover this same subject? Probably. But since I don't want to waste too much of my time reading screenplay books, I found this one to give me exactly what I needed. And I'll make it interesting.
055358202X|5.0|I write this review with mixed feelings. Let me begin by saying that I think this book is great. Mr. Martin shows the same quality here as in the first three books. It is true that there is less action here, but every story has different stages with different requirements. It is obvious that the aftermath of a great war cannot be as tumultous as the war itself. Many people complain about their favorite characters not being here and I understand them. One reads this saga because of the characters. So, no matter how well written is something, if you don't care about the characters, you will not enjoy the book. I was fortunate, because my favorite character is Arya. Eventhough there were only a few chapters about her, I turned every page with the hope that there would be another Arya story. In short, I think this book is worthy of the same praise the other three received, but...    Let me now explain why I have mixed feelings. It is true that the pace of this book is slow. Not much happens in more than six hundred pages. At first sight this is not a problem. When one is reading quality literature, the more the better. But when one considers some implications, this point of view changes. At this pace, I think it is impossible that the series will end in three more books. A Dance with Dragons will not go in time beyond A Feast for Crows. This means the whole Cersei thing won't be resolved until book six. But not only that, we have to consider all the loose ends remaining in Feast added with those of Dance. Even assuming that some plots resolve quickly in book six, this means that there remains only one book and a half of story, and still the Starks are children, Jon and Daenerys are still teenagers.  Despite all the talk that the series doesn't depict clearly good or evil characters, the truth of the matter is that the Starks and Daenerys are \\"the good guys\\", at least the leading characters. Not for nothing the saga is named A Song of Ice and Fire. I have been waiting tosee them grow and become the characters they potentially are. For me the greatest strength of this series is that we have witnessed all the struggles and trials these characters endured in order to become the people they are. But the thing is that moment doesn't arrive, they continue to be children. This could mean that Bran, Sansa and Arya will not play a major role in the climax of the story, and that Jon and Daenerys will defeat rivals which surpass them in experience. If this is going to happen I will be dissaponted. On the other hand, this could mean that we will read only a book and a half with the grown protagonists. But then this would be a let down. If reading about children and teenagers has been a profound experience, can you imagine reading about them as mature and experienced people. I can't wait to read that. I have been waiting more than five years and I am ready to wait whatever it takes. I would like to read at least as many books of them as adults as have been published.    This takes me to the final point. If George Martin enjoys writing about Brienne in such detail, I think he will enjoy more writing about an adult Arya or Bran. This makes me think that the series will have more books than seven, which is a good thing for me due to what I have said. At the same time is a terrible thing, because that means that the most probable thing to happen is that the series will never be completed. Let me say the truth. Mr. Martin is a first class writer. In my opinion he is at the same level of Borges or Joyce, but most of his life he was just a little known writer with no fans. Then he began writing what could be one of the best works of literature of all time, and with it came fame and success. And he is enjoying that, because he waited his whole life for this, and he deserved it. The problem, I think, is that he lost his way in the process. He spends so much time with the fans, traveling, editing other books and many other innumerable projects, that hehardly has any time or energy to write his magnus opus. He took five years to publish what he calls half a book, and he will take probably three years to write a book which he said he had more than half already written. This means he will take at least seven years to complete the sixth book (or four if the publishers force him to split it too). Mr. Martin isn't young and if he dies before finishing his saga, all will be lost. What could have been one of the greatest stories of all time will be nothing. Cervantes wouldn't be what he is if he hasn't finished \\"El Quijote\\". Eventhough the Tuft stories are good, eventhough Fevre Dream is the best vampire story I've ever read, Mr. martin will be rembered by A SoIF.     I hope he realizes that he is an artist and that his legacy is at risk, I hope he finds again happiness in writing instead of being a torture that keeps him from going to conventions. I hope he finishes this series in a way that fulfills all expectations. I hope to see him occupy his rightful place in literature history. I hope and I wait.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I bought this watch for myself for Christmas 3 years ago and still love it.     At the time I really wanted a Breitling Navitimer Fighter but they were selling for around $3,000, and I knew I wouldn't feel comfortable walking around with thousands of bucks on my wrist.    I happened on this watch on Amazon and was immediately taken with it. Let me say, that the photo does not do this watch justice. When I received the Seiko I was surprised that it had much more sparkle than this photo imparts. And what really impressed me was that the face has great depth to it. The photo on Amazon shows a flat black surface with a mishmash of white lettering all over it, but in reality it looks much more like a mini metal Roman Colliseum with raised sides and a recessed center plain under thick glass. The face is about 3/8\\" thick. Very substantial and classy looking. Also, there is more contrast between the shiny center of the wrist band next to the flat silver sides than this photo indicates.    I wore it to work one day, and a female coworker remarked,\\"your watch is gorgeous!\\" and that she was looking for one like it for her husband. And when I told her the price she couldn't believe it.    The Breitling Navitimer is a beautiful watch, but since owning this Seiko Chronograph I rarely ever think about owning a Breitling. And since Navitimers now sell for over $6000 I feel even better about the $475 Seiko I got for $200.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|Philip K. Dick has been the resource of stories for some very exciting films (Minority Report, Total Recall, Blade Runner), but in NEXT, his short story 'The Golden Man' as adapted by Gary Goldman and directed by Lee Tamahori, the concept of precognition as a human feature in altering  the future falls into a video game format that becomes more action film and less human interest tale.<br /><br />Cris Johnson AKA Frank Cadillac (Nicholas Cage) is a sloe eyed Las Vegas grungy magician who has found a way to hide the fact that he has the gift to see two minutes into his future, a gift that rewards him at the gambling tables but draws attention from the FBI after a thwarted attempt on Cris' part to stop a robbery is captured on video tape. The FBI, especially Agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore), knows that a nuclear device has entered the USA by terrorists headed by 'Mr. Smith' (Thomas Kretschmann), and that if the device cannot be traced, a nuclear bomb threatens the lives of millions of citizens.  Agent Callie observes Cris' talent and engages him to aid in the discovery of the site of the device. But Chris' powers lead him to a beautiful young woman Liz (Jessica Biel) with whom his powers to see into the future can be extended for more than the requisite 2 minutes. After a series of 'attempts' at introduction, Cris and Liz bond, allowing Cris' expanded powers to be of more help to the persistent Agent Callie.  From that point on the film dissolves into yet another combustible crashing action flick with endless CG special effects, all but erasing the character development.  And the ending is as one might expect - not very Philip K. Dick in style.<br /><br />Cage and Biel do well, Moore seems bored with her character, and Kretschman yet again embodies the evil of terrorism and beyond. There are some rather extraneous scenes on an Indian reservation that add little except the beauty of the Grand Canyon to the story, and there are some truly funny scenes of themes and variations on the chances we take in approaching a potential love source.  But in the end all gets rather lost in the explosions ad infinitum that mark the film as a routine action flick.  Grady Harp, September 07e chances we take in approaching a potential love source.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|I must admit that I have never been a huge fan of the RHCP.  However, after listening to their most recent Greatest Hits collaboration, they really grew on me rather quickly.  Then, for some odd reason, I decided to put that cd into my player at work and couldn't stop listening to it.  So, about a month ago, I grabbed this double cd set off of the library shelves and simply can't get enough!  I'm hugely impressed by the RHCP and can't believe what a wonderful album they have produced.  I don't even have to skip a single song and that's saying something when you have a total of 28 songs - not a stinker in the whole bunch.  RHCP have kind of became a permanent \\"sound\\" in my car.  Both cd's are interchanged with equal play time for over the past 2 weeks now.  I gotta say that I'm lovin' it!  In my opinion, I must say that this is probably the most consistent and enjoyable cd set to come my way in a very long time.<br /><br />Keep rockin' it RHCP!!
0671015206|2.0|I think that it offers good tips, HOWEVER. I have a friend who is super cheap. Which is fine if you don't want to spend your money on yourself but money shouldn't come out of my pocket to help you. she is the type to never contribute to gas and tolls on trips, and never take her car. Always seem to be short a dinner or the cover charge in a club. I could go on and on with incidents, but I stopped going anywhere with her for this reason. I noticed in her profile she listed this book as one of her favorites. I think it offers a guideline but it is sometimes not frugal but acting cheap. so I understand why many say this about the book. What are you saving your money for, but to spend it later.
075640407X|5.0|I want to join the chorus saying that if you like fantasy novels, you just have to read this book.  And even if you don't usually like fantasy novels, you should try this book, because it's so much better than most novels.    One of the best things about this book is the writing itself.  So often writers try to create a sense of \\"someplace different\\" by using dense, archaic-sounding language.  The Name of the Wind is just the opposite.  It's written in plain, clear, wonderful prose, sentences and paragraphs that are almost effortless to read (the kind that take so much effort to write).      No gunky, old-fashioned-sounding prose is needed here because the \\"someplace different\\" comes alive through details.  Yet the pace is still brisk because those details aren't fleshed out in separate, long-winded passages.  Instead they appear in the background, naturally, as the characters interact with the environment.      Speaking of the characters, they feel so real, you can imagine meeting up with them sometime and having a chat.  And you want to.  Oh, except, actually, you'd never want to meet up with the bad guys in this one....    Something else that really stood out to me were the hopeful, warm, human scenes in even the darkest parts of the story.  I get tired of books (movies, TV shows, etc.) that emphasize humanity's (and especially men's) capacity for violence, selfishness, and callousness.  It was refreshing to read, for example, of the hero's happily married, sexy parents, or of the hero's taking time to ensure that a little girl would feel safe even after he left.      Finally, others have discussed how the plot covers some familiar fantasy ground, but in a fresh, more realistic way.  Indeed, it does.  It's extremely entertaining.  So much so, that this is the only bad thing I have to say about the book:  I didn't realize until I'd almost finished it that it was the debut in an unfinished series, and it's really hard to wait for the next book!  Pat Rothfuss, please finish the next book!
B000K7UBTI|1.0|Boring ! Boring ! Boring ! Frankly the XMen Animated Cartoon series in any one episode was better drawn and more interesting than this movie. It was sappy and silly.
B000068IEU|5.0|One word and one one alone describes this piece of celluloid greatness: WOW.       The film starts off like a runaway freight train of fright, immediately sucking you into the twisted, macabre minds of its creators (who expertly weave biting social commentary into their tapestry of terror...the viewer cannot help but wonder if the young heroine's fate might have been different had she heeded her parents' advice and not embraced the bra-less heathenry of the early 70s counterculture) with a tense tableau of birthday party preparations and strolls through the foliage. Not for the faint of heart, these opening scenes have turned many a viewer away in repulsion...even the most strong-stomached horror buffs have been known to break into involuntary \\"scare spasms\\" during the groundbreaking-at-its-time \\"ice cream scene.\\"    This scream-a-minute thrillride won't let you catch your breath after that, either. Thousands of \\"Last Housers\\" around the world can testify to the terror of \\"the chicken lady\\" and to the impact of this film on future horror canon classics like \\"Home Alone,\\" but you'll just have to see for yourself--unless you're covering your eyes the whole time!!!!!!!    Be sure to track down a copy of the soundtrack to complete your Last House experience!!!!

B000002JSP|4.0|Led Zeppelin has had an extensive music library.  Including their first four masterpieces: [[ASIN:B000002J01 Led Zeppelin 1]], [[ASIN:B000002J03 Led Zeppelin II]], [[ASIN:B000002J1U Led Zeppelin III]], [[ASIN:B000002J09 Led Zeppelin IV (aka ZOSO)]], then two more classics, [[ASIN:B000002J0B Houses Of The Holy]] and [[ASIN:B000002JSN Physical Graffiti]], followed by less the less than stellar [[ASIN:B000002JSJ Presence]].    Then comes their finale, In Through the Out Door.  An album every Led Zeppelin fan should not only hear but possess.  It is the end to an era and a pretty enjoyable album in its own right.    My favorites are Fool in the Rain and All My Love.    Recommended.

B000B8QEYC|5.0|Ok, as weird as the title for this review is--it's so true. I love Enya's music and after \\"Painting the sky with stars\\" I was afraid it wouldn't be as good or that it was just going to all be the same (because a lot of her songs are similar but still different and enjoyable of course) but it wasn't! I already have favorite songs on this CD and the music will sweep you away.     Put this CD on in your room, relax on your bed, and your mind will wander peacefully the entire time. Great for going to sleep too. Very soothing.
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|Saw this movie at the movie theater and love it, what I ride?   I believe I was watching the PG13 version and I did not feel like I was missing anything except enjoying the heck out of it.  I thought this is the best action movie this summer.  I will buy this Blu-ray movie for sure once it is available.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|1978's \\"Grease\\" was a cultural and critical success and it's not hard to see why. The Rockin' Rydell Edition is the only way to go as the colors have never looked more bright, the scenes are totally scratch-free and the digital soundtrack makes for a better experience than the original DVD. I'd buy it mostly for the first two reasonsand not for the latter as the sound clean-up is not is not as impressive as the look of the film.<br /><br />Seeing a movie like this so many years after it first came out reminded of why I liked it from the very first frame. The familiar boy meets girl tale is elevated to classic status due to the star appeal of its leads, the great casting of the supporting cast (particularly a long in the tooth Stockard Channing, but no one else could have played Rizzo), non-stop singing of beyond catchy songs, top-notch musical numbers, and even manages to sneak some old timers for fun.<br /><br />It's really a wealth of riches and one of my favorite musicals. If you are too young to have seen this when it first came out and think that the recent \\"Hairspray\\" was good, you may think that this is even better. For the others who missed it when it came out, it will make you yearn for the good old days even if you did not go to school in the late 1950s. While the movie was pre MTV and has none of the fast edits of say \\"Flashdance\\", the goes by so fast and leaves you wanting to see it again.<br /><br />The DVD extras are OK, esp. interviews but the alternate takes part is lame. If only all movies could be this entertaining.<br /><br />\\"There are worst things I could do....\\"
B000M341QE|5.0|Well, I'm a Martin Scorsese fan today, I was one yesterday, and I will be one tomorrow. How astonishing it is that this auteur, so late in his career, continues to direct and create such top shelf productions like The Departed and Gangs of New York. Was Goodfellas his masterpiece? The simple fact is that we won't know until the day he retires.<br /><br />The Departed is both action picture and psychological drama. Damon and DiCaprio play characters who mirror one another yet whose separate, but dependent, interactions fuel the plot. Both actors give inspired performances, but when Jack Nicholson's Francis Costello is onscreen it is hard to focus on anything else. He's spectacular in this role; a role which perhaps he was born to play. One of The Departed's most intriguing sub-issues are the Satanic qualities of Costello who, in one segment, is shot at the theatre with goat-tee, wearing a purple coat, and appearing amidst a reddish background. It's a heckuva shot. The subtext definitely is provocative, but you will probably not think of that the first time you see The Departed. The action is so intense that it is a challenge to get beyond thinking about what will happen next. This film represents more brilliant work from the most brilliant man in Hollywood.
B000HIVO64|5.0|I was not really sure how I would like this album after listening to both Geuro and Gerolito. The information has a sound very similar to actually 3 of his former CD's. Of course, Guero is the first one. The other is Sea Change, and the 3rd is Mutations, to some degree. My favorite cut is #10 on the CD. I forgot the title. I just love it. Soldier Jane is a good one too. There is a lot of value in the album. I think it is even better than mutations. Beck seems a little depressed on a couple of good songs too, but, sounds like he is going through a spiritual search or something. Beck just keeps evolving, however. Can't wait to watch the DVD the album came with. Next thing you know, Beck may be coming out with some old Standards with a trio. (From the 1940's).You never know what Beck will do next. Keep lovin' him.<br />Peace<br />Dirk-David Todd

1401207138|5.0|Watchmen by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons is my absolute favorite graphic novel. I just finished re-reading it. It's actually the comic that inspired all of my magical approaches to using comics as a magical tool/technique. I'm also always amazed at just how in-depth the story is...how much detail is put into the characters, even the minor ones.<br /><br />I also have my favorite characters, which are the Comedian, Rorschach, and Ozymandias. I like all of them because they stand out as fairly unique characters even in a comic book that already has unique characters. They have very distinctive personalities...<br /><br />The comedian is a very amoral character and that amorality allows him to embrace perspectives that enable him to move past situations that would stop people. He knows his nature and utterly accepts without the moral qualms that many people would have. I like his character not because of his actions, but because he is so at peace with who and what he is.<br /><br />Rorschach...well my favorite scene is where someone attacks him and he uses only his shirt to essentially trap the person...your hands, my perspective. Again his is a perspective that allows him to see past the obvious constraints and find solutions where other people won't go.<br /><br />And ozymandias embodies lateral thinking overall...again that perspective, that way of taking a situation and turning it from a disaster into something else. Plus a continued focus on improving himself, being able to see what he can do...and not letting limitations stop him.<br /><br />I admire anyone who takes a different perspective and makes it work.<br /><br />Good book...go read it if you haven't...cause it definitely applies to the post 9/11 world.
B000TGCR3S|5.0|Tekkon Kinkreet is a really great movie I enjoyed the story very much. Plus the picture quality in Blu-Ray was amazing. The audio was pretty good. I am not going to try to spoil this movie for viewers but I will say this if you loved movies such as Paprika, Akira, or any other anime movie thats similar to those ones then i highly recommend buying this movie no matter if you have to buy it on dvd, Blu-Ray, or UMD its still a must have.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|Quentin Tarrentino's films are patterned after the sleazy exploitation films of the 1970s. Such exploitation schlock as \\"Eat my Dust\\" and \\"Humanoids from the Deep\\" were passing entertainment in their time, but nobody called Roger Corman a genius.     So what is everyone so \\"ga ga\\" over Quentin Terrintino?     Yes, once again Quentin's tribute to bad movies is- a bad movie!

0316010669|3.0|A few years ago, Malcolm Gladwell wrote a very entertaining book, [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point]]. He had a central thesis, and while it was plausible, I wasn't particularly convinced. BUT Gladwell is one of the best writers around at making psychology experiments and other social science studies fascinating and accessible, so the book was interesting and fun to read.    That brings us to Blink, in which Gladwell seeks to demonstrate that our split-second first impressions can be incredibly insightful but that sometimes they are not, and how we can train ourselves to move toward the insightful side. The book is not particularly convincing (even less than Tipping) on the final aspect of the thesis that we can train ourselves to do better. But along the way, he presents fascinating cases of how these snap judgments can be right on (and why they're wrong when they are). The research isn't quite as interesting as in The Tipping Point, but I was still engrossed, entertained, and instructed.    For an example of a psychology writer who also makes research fascinating and accessible (and funny) but is much more convincing on his hypothesis, read the excellent [[ASIN:1400077427 Stumbling on Happiness]], by Harvard psychology professor Dan Gilbert. He also reads the audiobook himself and does a fantastic job.    Despite my critiques, this was still good enough that I'll read whatever Gladwell gives us next.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing \\"Grindhouse\\" on my birthday.  When I got to the local cinema I found out they pulled it.  The given explanation was the Virginia Tech massacre but methinks it was audience apathy.  I ended up sipping wine coolers with my wife and watching \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" at home.  In retrospect that was a more pleasurable experience then watching \\"Death Proof\\".  I can't fathom it but Quentin Tarantino lost it here.  Maybe the flick would be best appreciated in it's truncated form in the context of \\"Grindhouse\\".  Maybe not.  Tarantino cites classic drive-in fare from the seventies as \\"Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry\\", \\"Vanishing Point\\" and \\"Big Wednesday\\".  Somebody should inform Quentin that the makers of those films just went out and made good movies without a hint of self consciousness.  In an interview with \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" Tarantino said he employed Kurt Russell to get him back to the Snake Plissken kind of roles.  Could have fooled me because Russell is virtually wasted here.  Tarantino's knack for writing crisp, witty dialogue is virtually absent here.  I heard a better reference to \\"B.J. and the Bear\\" on \\"My Name is Earl\\" the other night.  The only time I remotely chuckled was from a cell phone ring tone that referenced \\"Kill Bill\\".  The film's lone redeeming qualities are engaging performances from Rosario Dawson and Kiwi actress-stuntwoman Zoe Bell and one half decent car chase.  I have never disliked a Tarantino film until this one.  Here the self-indulgent qualities that were muted in his other films come out in full force.  Maybe Tarantino will learn from this misfire.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Half of the tracks are upbeat which I prefer Coldplay's music to portray, and after studying this album's nooks and crannies, I found just TWO duds. b^_^b<br /><br />White Shadows, Fix You, Twisted Logic, Square One, Low, Speed Of Sound, Talk & X&Y are amongst the great tracks.<br /><br />But then you have filler tracks such as What If and Swallowed In The Sea. The rest of the CD is full of decent if just a tad forgetful tracks; A Message, The Hardest Part & Till Kingdom Come definitely fill my mind first.<br /><br />I was SO looking forward to this release because I have their 2 previous albums and I highly enjoyed tracks such as In My Place, Clocks and Daylight, for their uplifting, positive demeanor.<br /><br />Coldplay has an interesting lyric here and there, and my initial thoughts told me that it wasn't enough. White Shadows was a low point for me, but thank goodness I saw a quirky but awesome video to accompany the song, and I was totally, totally hooked!<br /><br />With that said, I can't wait to experience their new sound in mid-late 2008 or early 2009: I bet they release it around then and it'd be best if it were better than this one!

B000TGCR38|5.0|I think the best reason to view this movie is to watch Carice van Houten as she plays the part of Rachel Stein, a Dutch Jew trying to stay alive during the Nazi occupation of Holland in 1944. Rachel is forced to assume a different identity as Ellis de Vries ( recruited by the Dutch Resistance following the betrayal and deaths of her parents and brother), even going so far as to dye her dark hair blonde to hide her Jewishness from SS Officer Ludwig Muentze in order to gain his confidence and infiltrate the Nazi HQ. Carice is incredibly convincing as the sexy ex-cabaret singer entertaining the smitten Captain Muentze, with whom she becomes infatuated, and his fellow SS officers with her 40s Bombshell looks and sweet voice.     The movie was a well-written, exciting, and suspenseful foreign language film (in Dutch, German, and English) from beginning to end. I highly recommend BLACK BOOK to anyone who enjoys good film making.

B000BRBA8S|3.0|Director Wong Kar Wai's film, \\"2046\\" is different if anything. I was not really sure what to make of the film when I first viewed it a few years ago. And after viewing it again tonight, I am not really sure if I would want to see it again. That is not to say that others will not find something in the film that appeals to them. The first time I viewed the film I had a difficult time with it. However, on second viewing, I was a bit bored. For me, the film was one of those you can watch once, maybe even twice, but that's about it. Or maybe it's the mood one is in? However, it is not a bad film, and if anything it will appeal to some viewers. What I did like about this film is that it is definitely a departure from so many other films out there---and especially films from Asia. And I hope the trend continues.<br /><br />There are some very good reviews of this film, and I will not rehash what has already been written by others--and much more eloquently I might add. The films narrative begins with what appears to be a futuristic world. With the use of CGI, there are trains darting back and forth. Here the narration sets the tone of the film, by relating how one can go on a journey to a distant place in order to recapture lost memories. The films protagonist, and voyager, is named Chow (Tony Leung). Chow is captivated by an era that holds many memories for him--and especially the memory of a woman long ago. Moreover, Chow lets the viewer know that he is the only one who has ever been back. No others have ever returned.<br /><br />The film highlights the mid 1960s; an era that Chow remembers fondly. This is also an era I grew up in as a young boy, and I thought that the director did a very good job with this particular part of the film. It was almost as if one is transported through time: as both the costumes, music, and entire atmosphere of the films period were great. But while I thought that this was done very well, I did not think the plot or the script was very good. The film moved at an extremely slow pace. Not that I dislike slow paced films if they are going somewhere---I just found this part of the film bothersome. Chow remembers fondly of the 1960s, and especially of a place where he lived called the \\"Oriental Hotel\\" in Hong Kong.<br /><br />Chow is a ladies man, and this is made clear in the film. In the film he portrays a writer who wishes to live in room 2046, where his memories of one woman in particular are strong. However, the manager informs him that the room is not available at the present time: For it has not been cleaned up. The manager offers Chow another room instead. Chow will eventually rent room 2047, across the hall, and wait for when the room becomes available, if at all. The film is partly an erotic story of the interaction between Chow and other women in the film, and mainly a prostitute (Ziyi Zhang). Yet, it is also about the story of a mysterious woman who once lived in the room that (Ziyi Zhang) is now renting.<br /><br />Moreover, as Chow is writing his own science-fiction story, he has interactions with other women whom he meets in the hotel. He even has a bizarre fixation on the hotel managers daughter, who is in love with a Japanese man. All the while, he is in the 1960s, yet also in the future, and at other times in the present. The film moves periodically back and forth from the 1960s and to the future and the present again. There were many scenes in the film that had a noirish feel to it: The 1960s for example. And while I do not think that this is a bad film, I did not think it was a great film either. It falls somewhere in between. Once again, the film will appeal to some viewers, and not others. I would not discourage others from viewing the film, however, before purchasing the film, I would recommend that viewers rent the film first.at an extremely slow pace.

B000TUXL2A|5.0|When I listen to Mark Knopfler, I think of the element Mercury --- what comes out of his guitar quietly and efficiently fills every available space. And it's been that way since the late 1970s, when Knopfler launched Dire Straits with \\"Sultans of Swing.\\"<br /><br />In that era, we were listening to New Wave bands like Talking Heads and the pounding disco of  \\"Saturday Night Fever.\\" But here was a group that seemed to champion old-fashioned music and pride itself on old school musicianship --- \\"Sultans\\" was a hymn to retro, just played by a band light years better than any duffers who might have performed it on a Saturday night in a smoky club in Newcastle.<br /><br />Over a thirty-year career, Mark Knopfler has proved that virtuosity has its charms. At one point in the mid-1980s, Dire Straits was the most successful band in the world; in a single year, the group gave 234 concerts and played for 2.5 million people. Knopfler's projects have sold a hundred million-plus CDs; he's produced CDs for superstars and written soundtracks for movies (Local Hero is the rare film that's as lovely to hear as to watch), and turned out-of-the-box collaborations (like All the Roadrunning, with Emmylou Harris) into crowd-pleasers.<br /><br />Kill to Get Crimson continues Knopfler's series of restrained solo albums. Many of the songs are short stories in miniature; their lyrics are precise and evocative. Cranking the volume won't turn most of them into rock anthems --- as with Chopin, you often have to lean in to get the nuance. This is complex, adult music: sophisticated and sincere, wry and guardedly hopeful. And the charm of it all is that, in his songs, one of rock's greatest icons still seems to see himself as a bit player in a traveling carnival.<br /><br />Knopfler lives in London. Third wife, four kids, several motorcycles, no scandal. He's generous in his charity, thrifty in his media --- the one-time journalist usually talks to the press only when he's got a new CD. Which is how, with \\"Kill to Get Crimson\\" just out, my phone rang, and there was Mark Knopfler's genial baritone. Knopfler is exceedingly polite, and I try to be; we began, as form dictates, with his new music.<br /><br />JK: There will always be many who want the \\"old\\" Knopfler. Is it possible you grew up and the audience didn't?<br /><br />MK: It has to be the other way around. I'm always amazed when it gets to the end of shows and I see all the young kids running to the stage.<br /><br />JK: Your lyrics taste like songs, but the words go down as poems. You started as a journalist. Ever think of...writing?<br /><br />MK: I'd be shabby dreadful. We should do what we're supposed to.<br /><br />JK: But you're said to be a huge reader.<br /><br />MK: No, I am a huge lazy bones. I can just as easily be found horizontal on the sofa as reading. I can pretend to be an intellectual --- I've usually got some book on the go. But I always feel behind, I'm always trying to catch up. I'm a victim, like others, of the laptop.<br /><br />JK: When Knopfler listens to Knopfler, what does he hear?<br /><br />MK: Just the music. I have to listen to it quite it lot before pressing time. It's alright then, because I know it's going to end.<br /><br />JK: You're both an artist and a scientist of the guitar: Is there a technical explanation for the effect your playing has on listeners --- or is it a mystery?<br /><br />MK: Scientist? I ought to have lessons. I'm about to pick up a guitar --- a cello guitar --- made by a great builder, and I'm going to learn to play it. I intend to improve as a player. But with my little ditties, I can only do what I do: I hum and strum.<br /><br />JK: Yes, you're just a busker from the North who got lucky. Seriously...<br /><br />MK: It seems to make no difference whether I'm playing vibrato on my left hand with a whammy bar on my right, or a bottleneck --- I can get a sound that resonates. That's the closest to an explanation I come. It's something to do with touch and vibrato. And what that is, I'm not sure.<br /><br />JK: Rolling Stone rates you as the 27th best guitarist in rock. If you keep at it, could you get to 25? 20?<br /><br />MK: I doubt it --- I'm going in the other direction. With any luck, I'll soon slip below l00.<br /><br />JK: Five words: \\"Mark Knopfler guitar charity auction.\\" Can you predict how old you'll be when you say those words --- if ever?<br /><br />MK: I do give guitars away as much as possible. And they're starting to make money. Someone paid 35,000 pounds the other day for a half-hour guitar lesson, which is one of the nice things about having some recognition.

0767817710|4.0|This is one of my favorite Westerns, if a guilty pleasure.  I love the fact that the movie itself has very little plot.  Big evil guy hosts a tournament, so a bunch of people come to town to shoot each other.  That's basically the overall plot.  But each of those characters has a back-story, and the intertwining of them creates a series of sub-plots like steel net holding the movie together.    If you haven't seen this in a while, check it out.  You may be surprised by the people in it, and all of them give excellent performances.  Of course Gene Hackman's great - he'd be brilliant sitting on a blank stage reading breakfast cereal side-panels.  Sharon Stone is wonderful, tortured between her lust for revenge and her fear of not being able to follow through (quite Hamlet-esque of her, really). Lance Henrickson, Keith David, Tobin Bell...     The real star of the movie, though, is Sam Raimi's direction.  Remember that bizarre camera work he used in \\"Evil Dead\\"?  Apply that kind of cinematography to the old west.  Wonderful!  I think my favorite shot is where the guy looks down after a gunfight, and his smug smile drains away when he sees the pinhole of sunlight in the middle of his shadow.    And how can you go wrong with a movie that features the sound of a whip as part of the theme music!  Only \\"Blazing Saddles\\" handled that with the same artistry!    I can never say that this is a great film, but it is a lot of fun to watch, particularly watching for the little nuances in the background.

You not only get all the above, but there's a suprise ending that speaks to the enormous inventiveness and talent of Mr. Bennett.<br /><br />Beg, borrow, steal or buy -- but don't miss this!

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|As an avid fan of criminal justice fiction (both written and onscreen) I felt like I had seen or read every angle there was to this genre. I've seen every season of Law & Order and its spin-offs, all the CSI series, Shark, Without a Trace, even, I'll admit it, watched JAG in the 90s.  I was getting bored with it all.  Then along came Dexter and WHAM!  I fell in love all over again.<br /><br />I actually think the Showtime series is even better than the books - though they are definitely well worth the read.  In my opinion, the show is perfectly cast with the exception of Deborah, Dexter's sister; although by the end of season 1 she too had started to grow on me.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|After watching this movie I made a rare purchase of it.  It's great and has it all.  Emotions, thrills,  humor, tragedy, history, politics, corruption, mystery, and a super ending!  This is not a \\"chick flick\\" though it would work well on a first date.  A boy and girl are childhood friends but as they mature this historical fictional film makes it clear that any potential match is doomed due to the different social and financial strata that exists between them.  They are literally forced to part by her father's \\"men\\".  Years pass and Edward Norton emerges as an mildly successful magician-showman of sorts who sets up his show in this European town (whose important name escapes me right now).  He is more like David Cooperfield than Houdini.  He is intentionally provocative, quick witted and brilliant.  The movie must be seen to be appreciated and to say more might spoil it.  I'm now an Edward Norton fan and I now see why such a fuss is made of Jessica Biel and her beauty.  The classic police inspector is portrayed by Paul Giamatti - he did a very nice job of it.  Some movie titles have so little to do with the story; here, THE ILLUSIONIST is just perfect.<br /><br />Watch this movie and you won't be sorry.<br />Donna
B000063V8R|5.0|I am watching ST: TNG from seasons 1-7 in order.  While seasons one and two are good and introduce everything.  Season three is where the show really starts to take off.  The dialog is a lot tighter and the plots are better.  \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" is one of the best examples of this.
6304884419|2.0|I was greatly surprised to see how many stars this film recieved by viewers, it certainly does not deserve such applause. \\"A bronx tale\\" is basically a tale about a typical Italian american boy growing up in the 60's ,who is mentored by a mobster. This underworld figure demonstrates a set of morals and he cares deeply for \\"calogero\\", who later in his teenage years falls in love with a black girl. His mentor, played by Palimentieri, teaches him that true love is all that counts. The plot means well, but the acting is awful and the message is not believeable.<br />Never, ever, in the 1960's would a large number of whites, regardless of how they earned a living, demonstrate such understanding. The film has an agenda and the role of the mobsters are incidental to the central point, which is calogeros' eventual love for the girl. Lilo Brancato and the characters of his friends display an incredible lack for acting. The writing is bad and the characters stiff. It is known that Robert deniro only dates women of color, and although there is certainly nothing wrong with that, his desire and predilection seem to dictate the direction of this movie. It is not moving, but rather offensive. Italian americans are overwhelmingly portrayed as dopey , all of them having a cross dangling from their necks. No, I did not like this movie. I grew up in Queens during the 70's. I am an Italian american who grew up in an Italian neighborhood.I found this film reeking from steriotypical ideas of what New Yorkers were like. The writing was awful and I cant stress how bad the acting is. I also do not believe the movie was completely based on the play, it was rewritten to fit personal profiles. The movie was insulting and false. A figment of Deniros idea of entertainment. He should have stuck to playing roles where he does what he does best, curse and swear.

To all of us, Rudy is a hero we can look up to. Great family movie and one of the best sports films around!

B0000021RG|3.0|5 stars for the band but not on the technical merits of this album..Ok, right off I'm going to admit that at this point I'm considering picking up the remastered-remixed re-everything  version Of Chicago at Carnegie hall just to see what total miracle the digital age boys could possibly do to make this album listenable... I bought it when was released in 1971. It was the worst, most awful sounding piece of crap I had in my collection at the time. I'm not one of those nose-in-the-air sterile audiophile types but you have to believe at the original release, it was a bust. Recording in a place like Carnagie must have been a nightmare for the engineers of the day. The mics on some cuts sound like they're placed out in the audience somewhere a mile away. If you ever attended a concert at an NFL domed stadium (one of those concrete things) you know what can happen to the sound. I was (and still am) a huge Chicago fan and couldn't wait to take my saved-up 13 bucks and go buy this 4 LP set. Right, I said 13 bucks. That was a bloody fortune at the time not to mention a waste of money and a major disappointment when I put it on the turntable. It sounded like crap. This could have been a monster live album from the hottest band of the day, but no, sound quality killed it on arrival. This is not a commentary about the band. This album and those before it and a couple after, was Chicago at top form before they went to market with all the later stupid pop garbage and were basically ruined as a major rock group. I'm going to give the CD version a go and drop in a few extra notes of commentary later about what quality changes were made by the remaster people. It had to be a big job.
B000001Y2U|2.0|I've been hard on Mr. Manson in the past, going back and forth between sort-of-liking and sort-of-hating his music, his personality, and his message. As a musician overall, there is definite talent to be heard within the unique lyrics, and the music contains a wonderful \\"merry-go-round-gone-to-hell\\" feel shrouded in a cynical worldview. This is indicative of the band's career as a whole, yet \\"Antichrist Superstar\\"--the album that launched them into super-duper stardom (and heavy MTV rotation, back when MTV actually played music videos), is the nadir of their creative output. When I first purchased it, I was surprised by the deadly-serious tone from the get-go, and all my subsequent listens (over the course of a decade) have yielded pretty much the same aural impression. Manson (Brian Warner)'s bid for a mainstream hit indeed paid off, but the result was an album so heavy-handed and eye-rollingly pretentious (just LOOK at the album art) that I--from the earliest tracks onward--just kept waiting for the damn thing to end (all while holding out hope that something would come along and blow me away in the meantime). I suppose it can be called a successful concept album insofar as lyrics go, but there's nothing transcendent in the music and the philosophy--like the album art--is, again, eye-rollingly pretentious. \\"Antichrist\\" finds some moments of redemption in 'Irresponsible Hate Anthem,' 'The Beautiful People,' 'Dried Up, Tied, and Dead to the World,' 'Minute of Decay,' and 'Man that You Fear,' but the rest of the album is just so much dead weight--dead to the world, and dead to the sensible listener.

B000OZ2CZW|4.0|I, like another reviewer stated, am probably outside of the demographic group that the label wants to buy into Rihanna but I loved the debut single, UMBRELLA and wanted to hear more.<br /><br />Given Rihanna's limited vocal ability and the way that her label is mass producing her I feared this album would be the worst of her three releases; however it was really smart of the powers that be to switch up her style and make a more pop-oriented disc.  There are no tracks on this disc with the island beats used previously to showcase her heritage but she also stayed in her vocal lane, didn't attempt runs out of her range & produced a good pop album.<br /><br />My standout tracks are:<br /><br />UMBRELLA - inescapably catchy single, excellent lead single choice<br /><br />DON'T STOP THE MUSIC - great dance club cut, love the techno beats<br /><br />REHAB - I like the musical arrangement moreseo than her vocals<br /><br />GOOD GIRL GONE BAD - love the production & the lyrics<br /><br />QUESTIONS EXISTING - dark single, love the production<br /><br />LEMME GET THAT - funny lyrics, excellent musical production<br /><br />SELL ME CANDY & BREAKING DISHES - although I don't like them as much as those previously mentioned, both feature catchy musical arrangements & fun pop lyrics<br /><br />I'd recommend this disc to pop music lovers and those who are curious about the new sound Rihanna's music has taken - it's a fun disc to listen to.
1932907009|3.0|This book contains alot of good advice for screenplay writing. however, the book is really aimed towards making \\"family films\\". all the movies he references are family films, and sometimes his own. It is a good book to get yourself in the right mindset for writing a screenplay but you can't rely on it to much or you might find yourself writing really dumb kids movies like \\"Blank Check\\". The process he gives you is very formulaic and his approach is more toward making money. but overall good read and good information. and who knows, maybe if you follow his advice to the point you could sell a screenplay to Spielberg for a million dollars too!
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|I used to hate Antonioni.  I took some film classes years ago, and all the \\"professors\\" were raving about Antonioni, and this film in particular.  They talked about what everything means, the \\"symbolism\\", the deeper meanings.  They were determined to take out all the joy of the film before I even saw it.<br /><br />Now that I've been out of school, I've forgotten all the BS they spewed, and I like Antonioni's work.  This is a great film, as great as its reputation suggests.  Antonioni is one of a small number of filmmakers who immersed himself entirely in a different culture (in this case, Swinging London), and made a film worthy of it (some examples of this phenomenon are Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice, and recently, Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima).  If you didn't know that Antonioni was Italian, you would have sworn the film was directed by an Englishman.  It's a unique, fascinating piece of cinema.  There isn't much dialogue, but most of it is pretty good.  It has some great setpieces, including The Yardbirds' concert at the end, the tennis game, the walk in the park, the \\"wrestling\\" scene, and the \\"blow up\\" scene.  At the end of the film, you're not sure what happened, but you know something did.  It's really an exceptional, thought provoking film, one of the best films of the 1960's and one of the most successful art films ever made.  Don't let film teachers ruin films for you.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|i loved this movie when i saw it in the theater. and i still enjoy it very much, however the \\"Extended and Unrated\\" parts of the dvd release are completely unnecessary. It worked better without those scenes. also what upset me about the movie was that in the first 40 min the movie has the \\"bad print\\" look, with the frame jumping and scratches. but after that 40 min it turns into a normal movie. it's like tarantino wanted to make two different films but put them in one. you get a little antsy getting to the good stuff but when it comes...it delivers.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Letters from Iwo Jima is an extraordinary film.  Despite its depiction of war, it is a much quieter, serene, and moving film than its sister film,  Flags of Our Fathers.  It does touch on how soldiers are pawns in politicans' schemes like Flags, but this film concentrates almost exclusively on the Japanese soldiers themselves, most of whom died defending the island.  Ken Watanabe gives a towering performance as the commander of the island, a vastly intelligent, articulate, caring man, who nevertheless does what he feels is his duty to his country, knowing very well that he will most likely be killed.  Like Flags, we really get to know these soldiers like we were in the platoon ourselves, and aside from a few war speeches, Letters and Flags never feel like they are propaganda, gun-ho garbage that Hollywood and others have been known for putting out.  Clint's direction is breathtakingly assured.  When you take into account that Clint speaks no Japanese, and he directs a film almost exclusively in Japanese, it makes the film even more extraordinary to behold.  There has only been a few films in history that have managed to do this, a film where a foreign director immerses himself so much in the culture that if you didn't know it was a foreign director directing the film, you'd swear it was a native of the country (Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, and Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice are examples of this phenomenon).<br /><br />Perhaps the best example of Clint's direction is in the following scene. One of the Japanese soldiers arrives at the island, and the other soldiers believe him to be a spy sent by the officers.  He eventually tells them his story, and why he was sent to Iwo Jima.  He was enforcing curfew in a local town with one of his officers, and they pass by one of the houses where a dog is barking rather loudly.  The officer informs the soldier to take the dog inside the house, and shoot it.  The soldier takes the dog into the house, and the family is horrified.  The soldier shoots a bullet in the air, and tells the family to keep the dog quiet. The soldier then leaves the house, but the dog barks again. The officer becomes furious, and he goes into the house to shoot the dog. But you never see the dog being shot, you only hear the shot, and see the soldier's reaction (only the officer goes into the house).  This makes the scene so powerful and sad. The soldier was sent to Iwo Jima because he let the dog live, and the officer was furious that the soldier disobeyed him.  The way Clint films this scene is why it's so memorable.  A lesser director would have shown the dog getting shot, with hand held shots and hysterical screaming. He would have tried to justify his decision by saying \\"it's more realistic\\", which it is, but there is no art, poetry, or intelligence in that. It's lame shock value, which will always lessen the dramatic impact of a scene.<br /><br />The lessons of war are so vivid here and in Flags.  Almost none of the Japanese soldiers made it back from Iwo Jima, and the American ones who did got exploited by the media and the government.  When they were done with them, they were forgotten about.  Both films are very sad, but they are necessary viewing.  There are moments of pure poetry in both films.  Letters has more though.  There is a deep sadness to this film especially, and it's darkened cinematography really enhances it.  This is one of Eastwood's greatest films, and one of the best war films ever made...horrified.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Great movie, it made me feel dizzy the first time I watched it. Thigs were moving too fast.
B000059TPN|2.0|I decided to see this film simply because my good friends at Criterion thought highly enough of it to put it in their collection.  They obviously did it for the money, because it's not a particularly good film. But then, if the money for this project went to finance DVD's like Berlin Alexanderplatz, then I'm OK with that.<br /><br />As for the film itself, a friend of mine recently called me in the middle of the night upset and irritated.  Thinking he was in jail or in some sort of trouble, but it wasn't like that at all.  He had just watched Michael Bay's film of the Transformers, and he said to me \\"I want to kill Michael Bay\\".  There are a lot of people in the world who despise Michael Bay, and with good reason.  This film is a good example of why.  The man cuts every 2 or 3 seconds, giving one a massive headache and eye strain. The dialogue here is laughable, as many of the character motivations. Connery has suppposedly been kept in isolation for 20 years or so, yet seems perfectly normal when released into the world.  When Connery and Cage's platoon initially meets Harris's band of thugs, the leader of Connery and Cage's platoon goes off on Harris, despite being surrounded by Harris's men (needless to say, they all get killed except Cage and Connery).  The acting is incredibly melodramatic, sometimes hilariously so.  The film is an immense piece of garbage, but it's better than Bay's Armageddon.  Bay's films are emblematic of what's wrong with Hollywood. Bad dialogue, crappy acting, implausible scripts, overwrought direction, etc., etc.. He must be stopped!<br /><br />For the record, I have friends who worked at Criterion, and they said that Michael was not the typical Hollywood prick. He treated everyone at Criterion pretty well. It don't make his film any better, though....
B000UR9QHQ|4.0|After seeing screen grab comparisons this new version has GOBS of extra detail in the 1080p transfer and the color timing lands squarely in between the extreme and pumped color pallet (almost cartoonish) of the THX Dean Cundey approved version and the completely 180 degree different Divimax version that everyone screamed bloody murder about.  The fall color timing is much improved over the Divimax version and much closer to the Cundey version, but the extremely BLUE!! color scheme of the night time shots has been toned down while still retaining the bluish tint created by gels on the lights.<br /><br />It allows for you to choose the original mono track in Dolby Digital and the new 5.1 mix in uncompressed PCM.<br /><br />It'll probably be good enough for me (it's a classic Carpenter horror!) and the extra detail will more than make up for any discrepancies in the colors.  Some say this cleaned up HD version looks as good or better than the original theatrical release.
B000RMQH30|4.0|Ben Harper's new CD is definately not his best, but after you realize that he recorded this CD in such a short amount of time, and had very little editing, you gain a new appreciation for this CD.

B000005J56|4.0|The best thing about Buena Vista Social Club and its musicians is that they are representative. A large, active Cuban musical tradition, of which BVSC is one example, thrives in the hotels and halls of Havana, Camaguey, Santiago de Cuba, and the like.<br /><br />What has happened here is a marketing coup that ought to be celebrated rather than derided, for it has brought the richness of Cuban son to our ears. If it had not come in the picturesque and personality-rich form of Ibrahim, Compay, and their pals, it would have happened via some other coterie of sonistas who looked and sounded much like them. They are everywhere.<br /><br />Meanwhile, let us love the ones we're with.<br /><br />An understated elegance drives this music forward. By other standards, it may appear underproduced or even quaint. On its own terms, it is neither. It would be a mistake for the listener to give into the temptation to smile condescendingly and define the music in terms of what is *is* not or *has* not.<br /><br />Rather, one must walk the humid streets of Havana with these musicians and revel in what it *is*, what it *has*.<br /><br />For example, a practiced irony of lyric. a perfectly matched instrumental and vocal relationship where no subset of either dominates the others; and the redolence of some very good cigar smoke.<br /><br />Then there is the magical capacity for viewing a 70-year-old musician as a man at the height of his powers rather than a has-been who just won't stop flogging the horse. Herein lies much of the music's charm.<br /><br />There are less edifying sights available these days than lithe Cuban men and women of nursing home age nosing about in unhurried and musical enjoyment to the admiration of their compatriots and, now, of us.
B000HT386M|4.0|Adam Sandler became famous playing comical, crude, and manic characters.  But, like many comedians, Sandler has illustrated that he isn't just a funny man and is able to handle more serious, dramatic material, too.  Showing that his dramatic turn in PUNCH DRUNK LOVE wasn't just a one-time fluke, Sandler stars in CLICK, a transition piece for the actor that allowed him to display his dramatic acting chops but not completely forsaking his comic roots.  CLICK can best be described as a cross between IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and the classic medieval tale of Faustus.<br /><br />Sandler portrays a young architect named Michael Newman.  Michael works for an incredibly pompous man named Ammer (David Hasselhoff).  Michael is a man who doesn't know how to say no to Ammer's requests and finds himself spending more and more time at work.  Professionally, it has started to provide benefits, but at the cost of alienating himself from his family.<br /><br />Deeply frustrated one evening with all the lack of control the different remote controls in his house seem to have (as well as the lack of control he seems to have with his life), Michael sets out to a Bed, Bath, and Beyond (can you say product placement) to find a universal remote.  Michael finds himself wandering into the darkest corners of the \\"Beyond\\" part of the store where he meet Morty (Christopher Walken).  Morty gives Michael a truly universal remote. It solves his remote control problem.  However, as Michael soon learns, the universal remote also works with his real life.  He is able to mute his wife during arguments, fast forward through boring family dinners, or pause a moment in time to perform a practical joke.  Michael thinks the remote is the greatest thing in the world until he learns that the remote begins operating upon memory and then Michael's life truly runs out of control.<br />CLICK is a decent movie.  It has some funny moments, but it's also a dramatic film with a positive message about appreciating the simple, yet finer things in life.  The acting by the entire cast is well done and though there are a few cruder moments of humor (typical of a Sandler picture) there isn't anything outrageous.  I will say that about three-fourths of the way into the movie things became somewhat confusing for me, but after thinking and talking about the movie later things became clear.<br /><br />Overall, CLICK is a must-see for Sandler diehards and just a regular entertaining movie for everyone else.gs in life.

B00005JPRF|3.0|This movie has a few things going for it: shambling virus-ridden zombies, evil corporate types in neckties and English accents, and Milla. Well, maybe just one: Milla.<br /><br />The franchise continues, and the uninfected survivors have dropped to a handful. As you expect, the \\"uninfected\\" and \\"survivor\\" groups both drop even more through the movie, amid festoons of gore. Also as you expect (or at least hope), the worst of the baddies get theirs in the end. It's not wholly a splatter movie, though: a heavy-handed tribute to Hitchcock appears partway through.<br /><br />The real attraction is Jovovich being the baddest badgirl on the block. Maybe the chilliest, too - someone should give the poor lady a blanket, or at least a camisole. (Come to think of it, Milla in lack of a wardrobe is an attraction, too.) Then, at the last minute, we get some sequel-bait that promises more of Ludmilla in some forthcoming follow-on flick. Lots more of her, lots and lots.<br /><br />Set your expectations low enough, and this movie will rise to them or beyond. It's a movie adaptation of a video game, fer cryin' out loud - what did you expect?<br /><br />-- wiredweird
1932100660|5.0|I've known for many years that eliminating animal products from my diet would give me better health, but I still chose to eat meat because I liked the taste of it. You only live once right? Why not enjoy yourself and eat what tastes good? This was the way I used to rationalize my eating habits.    The China Study has literally changed my life. Dr. Campbell lays out the differences between 'Diseases of poverty' and 'Diseases of affluence'. We in the United States are definitely suffering from the diseases of affluence. After  seeing all the scientific information laid out regarding human nutrition, I could no longer rationalize eating animal products.     The information Dr. Campbell shows between animal products and cancer rates is very hard to believe. If these studies are indeed accurate, there is definitely some type of conspiracy going on to keep them out of the public's eye. The amazing thing however, is that the he also lays out almost every other disease of affluence and ties each and everyone to animal product consumption and/or refined sugars. Most of this scientific information has been published widely, but it is easy to ignore until you read it all consolidated in one book.    Since reading this book about two months ago, I've completely changed my diet. I now have heightened senses of smell and taste, and I had forgotten how good fresh fruits and vegetable tasted. I've now gone from being obese to the point of moderately overweight, all while eating MORE food. I have no doubt that my weight loss will continue until I'm considered a normal weight now that I'm eating real food. One drawback is that I've already had to buy new clothes as my old ones were too big.

Curtain Call has a good mix of hits that Em has had over the years like \\"The Way I Am\\", \\"Stan feat Dido\\" (one of my favs by him), \\"Lose Yourself\\", \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\", \\"Sing for the Moment and the new cut \\"When I'm Gone\\".  Its one of the most personal records by him that i've heard in awhile and its pretty deep.  I love those from him.<br /><br />But i also enjoy the songs where he's clowning or just having fun like \\"My Name Is\\", \\"Shake That\\" w/Nate Dogg (with a sick beat to it) and \\"Just Lose It\\".  I just enjoy that Eminem is never afraid to say whats up and even though sometimes he goes overboard..\\"Fack\\".  He still does like he wants to do it and thats no bullcrap or drama.  He just delivers the message straight whomever.<br /><br />Curtain Call is a good purchase for those looking to get some of his songs.  But don't want to go buying all his cds.

1401300529|5.0|This brilliantly written account of the Korean war by one of America's greatest journalist-writers, finally does justice to this forgotten conflict that claimed the lives of 30,000 Americans and many more Koreans and Chinese.  It was a terrible war, fought in savage and forbidding terrain, cold and wet, where American technology was virtually nullified by the fact that behind every hill was not a valley but more hills and more mountains.  It was also a war of many miscalculations, usually attributed to Douglas Macarthur and his intelligence chief General Willoughby and others around him.<br /><br />This book is harshest on Macarthur, at whose feet it lays the blame not only for not reacting to the first North Korean invasion of 1950, but not anticipating the Chinese strike five months later that overwhelmed many American units and caused many Americans to become POWs for two brutal years.  It is not clear how much of the critique of Macarthur is warranted and how much is political/ideological or mere hindsight.  But some facts cannot be ignored.  Macarthur didn't visit the front line, he ignored Korea time and again and it seems his intelligence chiefs ignored obvious warnings again and again.<br /><br />But outside of the critique of Macarthur this is a masterful account of the war and its tragedies and its players.  From the lowliest privates to the presidents of North and South Korea to Mao and Stalin and Truman, this is war reporting, storytelling and history at its best.  The only thing that may be missing, and a critique of many books on the conflict, is the lack of information on the last two years of the war. There are also several unwarranted political jives at the Bush administration for its role in Iraq, claiming that the same intelligence twisting carried out by Macarthur and his `arch-conservative' allies, led to both conflicts.  This political analysis may annoy some, and is probably wrong, but that aside, this book is a brilliant account of an important, and oft-ignored, conflict.<br /><br />Seth J.

0143038583|5.0|This is one of the first thoughtful critiques of the culture of `big' Organic to appear.  It was a decade in coming.  Since the advent of stores such as Whole Foods, the ideology of `Organic' has come to revolutionize the way Americans eat.  Organic is both an ideology, an ideal and a culture.  This book seeks to examine four meals and where they came from.  It looks a typical big agriculture diet, that uses pesticides and might be sold at McDonalds or Wallmart.  It examines a meal purchased as Whole Foods.  It also examines the ancient way of hunting food to survive and the development of agriculture.  But its most insightful chapter is the examination of the origins of food purchased in the `big Organic' superstores, such as Whole Foods.<br /><br />The author tracks the food back to its origins.  From a supermarket label that claims the chickens are free range to the house where the chickens are kept in a massive barracks, barely able to move because there are so many.  This book shows how the Organic industry is mostly a scam.  Organic has outgrown its roots and because the Dept. of Agriculture and the government has not issues rules regarding what is `Organic' it was only a matter of time before most things labeled `organic' were far from it.  The ideal of the `family farm' may be on the label of much `organic' food but it mostly comes from factories.  A brilliant analysis of what happens when ideals meat  the marketplace.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched the movie first and I loved it. I had to buy the series. It is just as good, maybe even better because it expands your appreciation for the characters. I love the dialogue. I'm so sorry that this series was cancelled because it really deserved better.
0671027387|4.0|This was a great book simply because Dan Brown wrote it. He has an amazing ability to draw readers into the last few hundred pages of his novels. There was a bit too much scientific information in this one for my liking, hence the four instead of five stars, but this is still a great book.<br /><br />However, if you're looking for your first Dan Brown read, go with Angels and Demons. It's the prequel to DaVinci Code and is in my opinion his best novel.
B000W0A97C|4.0|Great to hear some new material from Joni Mitchell...this has traces of 'Turbulent Indigo' as well as 'Night Ride Home'. It has a nice mix of folk-based lyrics matched with the style of her more recent work. 'Shine' resonated with me, with it's social messages. Overall a deep, consistent body of work that I really like.
B000IHY146|3.0|Please forgive the nay-saying, because I absolutely love Karen Dalton. I don't blame her for this misconceived effort, because it's clear that there was a production decision to give her the full Woodstock/LA 1970s pop funkmeister treatment. But one size most certainly does not fit all. The slick production doesn't work with her otherworldly voice. The production has a trivializing effect that taints about 3/4 of the tracks here, against which the sparser tracks like \\"Katie Cruel\\" and \\"Same Old Man\\" shine in comparison.    I don't think it's just hindsight that indicts this production; Joe Boyd produced records in the same era that (a) did the artists real justice, and (b) still hold up today. Sorry Harvey, but I wish we could have seen what Joe Boyd would do with Karen Dalton.    If you like Karen Dalton, go with her first album, \\"It's So Hard To Tell Who's Going To Love You The Best.\\" Or cherry-pick the best cuts from this one and leave the desecration of \\"How Sweet It Is\\" for James Taylor.

0553805460|5.0|First-time author, Jordan Belfort, may agree with the statement that what goes up, must eventually come down.  In his memoir, The Wolf of Wall Street, the boiler room broker recounts the extraordinary events of his life that made him a millionaire in his twenties, and eventually led to his 22-month prison sentence.  Belfort holds nothing back, providing rich anecdotes about everything from his eccentric, volatile father to his Quaalude trips to his stints with prostitutes across the globe.  In one chapter, he hilariously describes sinking his new yacht in the Mediterranean.  Given the choice to save 100,000$ cash, expensive jewelry, or 100 Quaaludes, he chose the drugs and spent the next few weeks high.  However, all his success in the boiler room (sometimes illegally achieved, he admits) eventually caught up with him.  He swindled 100 million dollars out of small investors and was eventually arrested.  Underneath all the debauchery and deceit though lies an unconventional love story between Mr. Belfort and his wife, affectionately called \\"The Duchess\\".  Although an often volatile, explosive relationship with abuse on many levels, their love for each other is obvious.  It's in this relationship that gives this latest confessional a heart, and makes it an absolute page-turner.  One never knows if these two can survive the highs and lows of the roller coaster they hopped on.  Jordan Belfort is honest, self-deprecating, detailed and hilarious.  Another must read for this fall and an absolute page turner.
B000RW3VD4|5.0|Meet Bud Fox(Charlie Sheen),a Wall Street broker. Bud Fox may be young,but despite that, has managed to become a very talented and successful broker. Something that any Wall Street broker would ask for,especially one so young.    And then, before Bud Fox knows it, he finds his luck taking a turn around the corner. This is when he snares his biggest client, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). Gordon Gekko is a corporate raider,with a high rolling career. If you are on Wall Street and you find yourself with clients like Gordon Gekko,you are destined for success.    But,behind closed doors,Gordan Gekko is a man that people don't know. Once Bud Fox discovers this, working under Gekko is going to be a strainlessly and fearful experience that will be hard to escape.    \\"Wall Street\\" is a film that defines the word \\"perfect\\". From watching \\"Wall Street\\",one is shown how Wall Street works as a business and the dangers of working there. At the same time,\\"Wall Street\\" never fails to represent its fiction. \\"Wall Street\\" is suspenseful and keeps one wondering what will happen next. The impeccable character chemistry(brought to life by comprehensive acting)move the film along well and balance out the suspense and regular,everyday drama of the film. At the same time,\\"Wall Street\\" pays homage to the 80's,showing what the whole \\"scene\\" in the 80's was about and documenting the technology of the 80's(as far as cell phones and computers are concerned). Add all of that together with some of the most ravishing film cinematography that you will ever find,and you have the perfect and ideal film out of \\"Wall Street\\".     Having the 20th Anniversary Edition of \\"Wall Street\\" on DVD is a real treat. Sure,Oliver Stone's commentary and the \\"Money Never Sleeps:The Making of Wall Street\\" documentary have been carried over. But,you do have the weight of the bonus feautures that are to be found on \\"Wall Street\\",whether it is learning more about the making of it(Oliver Stone's commentary and \\"Money Never Sleeps:The Making of Wall Street\\"),learning how the actors in this film feel about the financial world themselves(\\"Greed is Good\\"),or getting deleted scenes,along with commentaries for them and a(seperate)introduction by Oliver Stone. So,enjoy the bonus feautures,and don't worry about whether about originality or the act of recycling when going through them.    If you happen to enjoy nonfiction,suspense,drama,and a large and enjoyable amount of special feautures,you have come to the right place.
1932100660|5.0|This book was very informative and gives you a lot to think about.  Interesting and brings up a lot of points about diet and disease. A great read for anyone who thinks about what they eat and wants to live a healthy lifestyle.
B000P2A256|4.0|If you liked \\"Songs about Jane\\" you will probably like this one as well. \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" is great in its own right but the sound is slightly more pop then the songs on \\"Songs about Jane\\". The lyrics are a little weak on some of the songs however the music still sounds great as they are still a tight sounding band. It has an 80's sound to it without sounding too corny. I think its worth the money.
0553805460|1.0|This book is complete trash. Don't waste your money. Jordie doesn't reveal anything. Very little discussion of Stratton Oakmont.  I am starting to doubt he was the king of anything and maybe just  a front for a really smart guy. Spends too many pages missing his exwife.   This is a waste of time and money.  The wolf has become the joke.
0060989157|5.0|Art is a piece of work that moves you & this book did. I laughed, I was disgusted, I even cried. This is twenty years of a band strugling though fights, overdoses, suicide attempts, mariages, deaths, prison (it's all here!). I love how the story is told by different people so you can hearing everybody's version of what happened (crazy how everybody remebers things differently). You get to hear what happened behind closed doors & what wasn't in the tabloids. It truly was an awesome read - very hard to put down!

B00005JKG9|1.0|By all accounts, you're supposed to revel in the wonderful acting in this film. But how is that possible when you are assaulted constantly -- and I mean constantly -- by repeated use of the f-word? Don't tell me that the swearing is \\"realistic\\" or \\"true to the characters' personalities.\\" Using profanity at that level is simply the mark of an immature human being who knows no other way to express himself. The swearing is simply over-the-top and very quickly becomes mind-numbing and offensive to the point where you're so distracted you're not even listening to the dialogue anymore. I finished watching the film by myself -- my wife walked out and I don't blame her. Both of us never encountered such incredibly offensive and moronic people as portrayed in this film in our entire lives! To me, the unrelenting bombardment of f-words was merely for shock value and a crutch. Guess the writer couldn't think of anything else to say, huh?    And poor Jack Lemmon. For such a distinguished and legendary actor to get involved in drivel like this was extremely embarrassing and sad. I can't believe he needed the money -- guess he thought he was getting into something good around heavyweights such as Pacino, Baldwin, etc.    Avoid this movie! (And certainly don't watch it with any younger family members present.)
1594489505|5.0|What a book!! I was initially skeptical about buying this book because I loovvveeeed \\"Kite Runner\\" and I just did not believe that the author would be able to repeat his debut performance.    But I'm glad I was wrong.    This book, like Kite Runner is immensely readable and I find this book to be even better than Kite Runner. And that's a great compliment considering Kite Runner was mind-blowing.    Kudos to Khaled Hosseini for a wonderful book once again.
B000006OBQ|5.0|You can't get better than this, originally a double LP, now released on a single CD. There is is no recording date on the CD but the LP was released in September 1966, and Sinatra references his own 50th year during the concert (\\"I think I better sing before I turn 51\\"), so it was undoubtably recorded in 1966. This means Sinatra was still in peak form at the time.<br /><br />The great Count Basie Orchestra launches the show and then Sinatra enters saying \\"How did all these people get in my room\\"! The Basie Orchestra is fabulous providing the sort of backing that Sinatra should have used more in his career. They do a couple of instrumentals the best of which is \\"All of me\\" where I imagine most of the room jumped out of its skin when after a typical minimilist Piano statement of the tune the band enters unexpectedly with a fantastic crescendo chord.<br /><br />Sinatra is amazing, and there are so many great moments on this disc that its hard to pick out favourites in a short review. However I'll pick two, the swinging version of \\"Get me to the church on time\\" and \\"You make me feel so young\\". These two tracks alone demonstrate that the man had everything you could wish from a great singer. Beautiful phrasing, immaculate timing and an ability to hold an audience that few others have matched.<br /><br />There are 21 tracks on the CD, including a couple of monologues from Sinatra which are the two weakest tracks. The arranger and conducter is Quincy Jones, so no loss of quality on that front. This is an absolutely essential purchase for anybody interested in good music regardless of genre.
0440237688|4.0|I remember reading this book in elementary school.  I also remember that I hated this book.  I could not stand it.  As I grew older, I appreciated the nuances and messages contained in this \\"child\\" book.  I recommend this book to any child or adult on what an \\"utopian\\" society could look like.
B000002UB3|5.0|Oh what an album. By this stage the Beatles could barely talk to each other let alone make a record. Somehow out of disunity came this masterpiece of an album.<br /><br />From the opening track 'Come Together' (Lennon) through 'Something' (Harrison) 'Oh Darling' (McCartney) 'Here Comes The Sun' (Harrison) and finishing with the medley this is an album which combines great song-writing and performances of the highest quality. Of course George Martin also deserves enormous credit for his production work, as the sound of this album is a contributing factor to its greatness. I don't suppose the working atmosphere for George Martin was that great!<br /><br />I was 8 when this album came out and have happy memories of my Mum & Dad playing it at parties in the late sixties and early 70's. My Dad (RIP) was a stalwart Jazz and Blues fan who would soon tell where to go if you started advocating the latest pop album. Not the Beatles though, Help, Sgt Pepper and Abbey Road were all in his collection.<br /><br />It doesn't matter what sort of music you favour be it Baroque, Be-bop, Gilbert and Sullivan (as it happens I like Bach, Charlie Parker and The Mikado), this is an album that should be in your collection, along with most of the other Beatles albums as well.
B000FVGMC4|4.0|Paolo Nutini is taking the rock world, not by storm, but step by step, to create a name for himself.  From his humble beginnings in Glasgow to the world stage seems to be a matter of time.  I look forward to following his career.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Credit to director Paul Greengrass, this film maintains the high standard set by the Bourne Identity. Matt Damon reprises his role as the ex-hitman with amnesia, this time framed for a CIA mission that goes wrong.<br /><br />The rest of the cast are good with the always reliable Brian Cox putting in another top class performance. Unlike say the Transporter movies there is an edge of realism that puts this movie in a different league from most Hollywood action films. That said most of us have no idea what is going on in the world of the CIA/MI6 etc, so whether this bares any relation to reality is I suppose irrelevent. However last year somebody was poisoned with a radioactive isotope in a London Hotel, so nothing seems that far fetched these days!<br /><br />This is a fast-paced and gripping film that will keep you well entertained for all of its 108mins.
0374280967|5.0|I really enjoyed this short book.  The author is a genius of understatement here. The understated comedic interludes are really fun. One can also imagine the Queen having all the various \\"events\\" to deal with as an outgrowth of her reading activities. It made me better realize the possibilities of being a monarch, both its upside as well as its downside. It is well worth the \\"entry fee\\" to read this book.  Then, you can pass it on to someone else and seem very literate yourself.
6305754969|4.0|John Wayne plays Cole Thornton a hired gun who turns down a job to work for Bart Jason, as this would mean fighting his old mate J.P. (Robert Mitchum). In the end he fights with J.P. and Mississipi (James Caan) against Jason.<br /><br />Essentially this is virtual remake of Rio Bravo, and it isn't as good. Mitchum takes the Dean Martin role and James Cann the Ricky Nelson role. However Howard Hawks was a great filmmaker and he manages to make this a worthwhile and very entertaining movie in its own right.<br /><br />John Wayne is starting to show his age in this film. He was close to 60 when it was made, and Mitchum who was 10 years younger steals the film from Wayne. The kill or cure drunk cure for J.P. is probably the best scene in the film, and Mitchum plays it brilliantly. There are good supporting roles from the lovely Michele Carey as Joey and Arthur Hunnictt as 'Bull'.<br /><br />So if you liked Rio Bravo, you'll like this. It isn't quite the masterpiece Rio Bravo was but its a lot better than most.

B000TGCR38|5.0|Black Book the DVD is this generation's [[ASIN:6305736650 Casablanca]].  Simply put it is a World War II period piece, about a Jewish woman's struggle to survive in the last days of World War II.  Rachel Stein aka Ellis de Vries is played wonderfully Carice van Houten.    Another actress who I would like to single out for her fine performance is Halina Reijn, who plays Ronnie.      So, if you like foreign films, and don't mind reading subtitles.  Then you must see Black Book.    In if you enjoy Black Book, you might also like [[ASIN:B000ERVJQ8 The White Countess]].
B000B0WO0I|5.0|Wonderful new arragements of Simply Red's classic songs plus great new songs. This is a great album and a must have for every fan.
B0007GADZO|5.0|Alright, that's a weird way of putting it, but Vai is known for his weird musical tendencies, and that's what you get with this.  What is interesting is that about four songs have vocals.  Steve's vocals!  And even though singing isn't his forte, he's not bad at it.  There's the fun and upbeat \\"Firewall\\" and the more tender and intimate \\"I'm Your Secrets\\" and a few others.  Vai is still his experimental self, going all out with \\"Freak Show Excess\\", a more laid-back jam with Jibboom, fun with effects on Yai Yai, and a live, spiritual, cinematic piece called \\"Lotus Feet\\".    I like Steve Vai, the experimentalist, and in that vein, I was rewarded when I bought this.
B000ETQPYM|5.0|Do not be scared away by the cover of this one. Despite classifying it as 'chick-lit', it's definitely not your usual chick-lit, as there's a lot more depth to it than one would usually expect from chick-lit. It's beautiful and devastating. I'd recommend it to everybody, but make sure you have tissues nearby, because even though the book is generally optimistic, there are scenes that will break your heart.
1594489505|5.0|One word EXCELLENT.  The kite runner was awesome and so was this.  Its one of those books that you will enjoy reading,  you wont be able to put it down...awesome.

B00004Z400|3.0|Credit should be given where it is due, and in the stinking cesspool known as radio-friendly nu-metal, The Deftones are cited at the top. Naturally, that does not add up to a whole lot, but did end up marking a particular sound amongst the generic haze with some personal style and production. White Pony suffers from it's mixture of half-baked, semi-experimental tracks, uninteresting, sludgy power-riffs, and  self-absorbed vocals. With most of the album running by in a forgettable (though not dismissible) adolescent artsy angst, I am only reminded in the final stretch what happens when the band takes it's time (and to me sounds their best) to bring a splendidly recorded, time-lapsed decay to the process.
0385338902|5.0|Jonathan Tropper certainly takes his time to write each novel but the long wait is always worth it.  His fourth novel How to Talk to a Widower starts off pretty heavy but soon becomes the light and very entertaining read those of us who have read [[ASIN:0385338104 The Book of Joe]] (also published as [[ASIN:0099461234 Bush Falls]] in some markets), [[ASIN:0312272766 Plan B]] and [[ASIN:0385337426 Everything Changes]] have been eagerly been waiting in anticipation for.<br /><br />How to Talk to a Widower has the reader enter 29 year old Doug Parker's life just over a year after his wife Hailey was killed in a Colorado plane crash.  He has never gotten over her loss, his stepson Russ is angry with him because he wouldn't adopt him and has to live with his violent biological father who seems to love the kids of his new partner a lot more.  Now a policeman is holding the very same drunken teenage Russ up against the front doorframe having disturbed Doug from his usual night lying on the couch in a whisky induced slumber. Meanwhile one of his dead wife's married best friends is always hinting at giving him a little more than just a meatloaf every Tuesday. His mother is demanding he come visit her and his father a former surgeon who after suffering brain damage depending on his condition on the day doesn't always remember Hailey is dead. His twin sister tells him she is moving in with him and leaving her husband. His younger sister is marrying his best friend after that friend noticed her cleavage at the reception of Hailey's funeral and the two of them went up stairs, the inappropriateness of their actions and the way they met something which Doug can never forgive or accept. These events are just a sample of the many that will force Doug to retake his life and do the right thing.  Along the way we the reader are taken on a great ride which is extremely amusing at times and moving the next, a method of writing Tropper is surely the master of!<br /><br />Read all of his books, he's that good!ooks, he's that good!
B000654Z2I|5.0|Can, the German experimental band that started in the late '60's and still garner a small but enthusiastic audience thanks to reissues and continued press coverage, stretched the limits of music and sound as far as it could go.  Some may say it broke the limits, but that's a matter of taste and adventure.<br />  \\"Tago Mago\\" is the centerpiece of Can's career, a double CD that still boggles the mind today as it did over thirty years ago.  Given the comparatively primitive state of recording technology that existed at the time, the sounds Can created were nothing short of astonishing.  It is best to approach this disc as a soundscape as opposed to \\"traditional\\" music, because as we find by the second half of the CD, convention leaves the room.<br />  \\"Halleluwah\\" is an 18 minute percussive tour de force, with fluttering spacey keyboards punctuating the mix.  It's more of a weird jam session, but does not grow dull, which is a feat considering its length.  The real doozy is \\"Augmn\\", which is simply indescribable.  Low, moaning voices that would scare the hell out of Alfred Hitchcock and a mad organ that sounds like a fairground run by Satan himself make this spooky, ethereal and just plain weird.  Ditto \\"Peking O\\", with mainly demented shouts the main feature.<br />  Rock was about breaking the rules and going into worlds music wasn't supposed to go.  Can is the perfect portal to what acid/experimental music might sound like on the other side of the worm hole.  Are you adventurous enough to take this ride?
0618680004|1.0|Sadly Dawkins perpetuates the myth that there is some kind of terrible conflict between science and religion. Of course this is not true.    While Dawkins is an accomplished evolutionist, he is a pathetic philosopher. He spends his time attacking a strawman version of Christianity which his gullible audience will swallow without question. Atheists will eat it up because it will make them feel superior to everyone else because they are smarter than people of faith. He is preaching to the converted, which is mostly European atheists.    The absurdity of his argument is that he thinks it is irrational to believe in God, while at the same time he believes it is rational to believe that the finely tuned universe, life and human beings came about by pure, blind, random luck. He apparently believes that order comes from Chaos without intervention, and those who believe in God are the irrational ones. Kind of ironic I guess.
032147404X|2.0|The review is as much about the author as it is about photography.  This is not a book for a photographer who wants to master digital techniques.

0060853980|5.0|Good Omens was way too much fun.  I loved it--so much that I read it again a second time as soon as I finished it.  It's about Armegeddon, written with humor, intelligence, and a lovely sense of timing.  Quirky, hysterical, the story works on all sorts of levels.  And the characters are immensely likable... even the bad guys.  If you like humorous, fantastical books, definitely read this one.

B000062YAZ|1.0|This doesn't shock me, offend me or scare me. It just bores me. It's so repetitive! It's basically the same damn song all over again. \\"Postmortem\\" has essentially the same riff as \\"Jesus Saves\\"; \\"Criminally Insane\\" has the same drum break intro as \\"Epidemic\\"; \\"Alter of Sacrifice\\" has the same riff as \\"Reborn\\"; \\"Angel of Death\\" is one of the most overrated songs I've ever heard, just pure noise without any redeeming facets. I don't even mind loud music - I actually like it when it's done well. But when it's noise for the sake of noise? Forget it. And Slayer is just that. And as for the riffs themselves... \\"DUH doot duh-duh-duh DUH doot duh-duh-duh- DUH doot duh-duh-duh DUH doot\\"... what's brilliant about that? It's like Slayer decided that playing as fast and as loud as possible would make up for the fact that none of them could play. The lyrics... well, they aren't shocking at all. If a guy in a Cookie Monster voice grumbling about how he plays pool with Satan's uncle on Tuesdays shocks you, you're obviously easily shocked. Then again, nothing's shocking anymore. Or I'm jaded, one or the other. I can't think of a single reason to listen to this. If I want something fast `n' hard, I'll go with The Clash, who had plenty to say, and a lot of imagination. More than Slayer at any rate.<br />One more thing: people can say whatever they want, but that won't change the fact I think Slayer sucks and sucks hard. Just so you know.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I can't describe how eagerly I awaited this CD. I'm a big Linkin Park fan, but after listening to this CD, I may be more hesitant to buy any more of their CDs. It starts off okay with 'Wake', but then goes down hill. Most of the songs are soft, and not the 'soft' kind of way that made In The End a great song. The music itself seems different, and Chester makes up so much of this album that you wonder if Mike Shinoda was off doing another solo album. I miss the two of them singing/rapping in the same song, but you won't find a lot of that here. You also won't find any of those good-ole Linkin Park songs from the past. It really felt more like a Chester solo-album, and it wasn't that good. I give it two stars only because of the two or three songs I can pick out of this mess that I can listen to. Hopefully their next album, which following their time line won't come out until around 2010, will be better.
0553805460|5.0|[[ASIN:0553805460 The Wolf of Wall Street]]  The Wolf Of Wall Street is an unbelievable ride through the excesses of the '90s.

I have not read such an engaging and compelling book in many years and I only hope he writes a second book so he can fill in the blanks of what happened to him.  This guy must be truly brilliant...to have masterminded his way  through the financial world and then discover himself as a writer?  I cannot believe how well written the book is and how the writing gets better and better as the book progresses. This is Tom Wolf meets Good Fellas...No wonder Martin Scorsese want to make this book his next movie.  You cannot put it down.
B0007CNXUU|5.0|Just as the young Peter character in the story brands J. M. Barrie's new play as \\"magical,\\" so is this movie. It's a wonderful journey as James, a renowned playwright whose latest work is poorly received, finds his muse in Sylvia and her four three boys to the detriment of his own rather dull marriage.  I think I watched it three times in a row. You have to view it a few times to catch all the references from how James' time with this charming family translates into his triumphant play \\"Peter Pan.\\"  There are so many wonderful moments: Depp watching the boys jump on their beds and saying, \\"Young boys should never be made to go to bed.\\"  Julie Christie, as the snobby, proper grandmother getting caught up in the magic of the story. The love James and Sylvia felt for each other but never consummated (at least in this version) is heartrending.   A feel-good movie that's not preachy and that everyone can enjoy and be inspired by.
0743496728|5.0|Even though the subject matter of this abook is quite disturbing, most of my book club friends gave it 5 stars. At first I was saying it should be read by all parent and teachers. It gives such an insight into the torments of teenage life. However, I have ammended my opinion of the book's impact. It gives us insight into how we influence everyone we interact with in this life.  I will try to in the future be considerate of how I treat my family and all people I cross paths with.

B000UO338W|2.0|If you are tired of seeing our president berated on album covers - DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM.<br /><br />If you like Ministry for their music and not their political bias - BUY THE ALBUM I guess.<br /><br />How many more album covers will Ministry make with \\"W\\"??  Who knows.  The act does get tiring though.  Bands have come and gone at the expense of politics, but I guess that's what creates a \\"buzz\\" about them.  In Ministry's case, they haven't been \\"buzzworthy\\" since the mid-90's.  Tell me I'm wrong.  Look at their album sales.  Maybe it's time they get a clue.  I'm just tired of bands alienating many fans by not giving up the same rhetoric and message.  OK, you don't approve of the administration.  We get it.  Now move on.<br /><br />Aside from all the propaganda nonsense these youngsters are polluted with nowadays, the music still remains listenable for Ministry's sake.  Giving birth to the industrialized side of Metal, these guys have still remained and deserve some kudos for that I suppose.<br /><br />Begin to disapprove...
B0000024K1|5.0|First off, I love how they sampled Funkadelic's \\"Get Off Your A** and Jam\\" on \\"Bring the Noise\\". That song's screaming guitar riff is integrated as part of the song, rather than made into the whole song. See? That's how sampling should be done! It's got more than the screamy guitar; you also get some sweet turntable work, occasional honking sax blasts, and of course Chuck D. and Flavor Flav's amazing chemistry. Someone should've told Jay-Z about that before he recorded \\"Takeover\\" - pretty much him rapping over \\"Five to One\\". \\"Don't Believe the Hype\\" actually can stand pretty well with that classic song, especially with the chorus: \\"Don't believe the hype... duh-duh-don't believe the hyoe...\\".  \\"Cold Lampin with Flavor\\" (\\"Yeah BOOOOOOOOY!\\") is a blast, and it shows just how much charisma Flav had. And while \\"Terminator X to the Edge of Panic\\" is clearly inspired by \\"Jam-Master Jay\\" (the song, not the individual), it nonetheless shows how much talent PE had in the house. Seriously, two fantastic rappers, and one awesome DJ. That's more talent in three guys than in the entire G-Unit \\"posse\\". I only kinda like the next \\"song\\", \\"Mind Terrorist\\", but in truth it's cool because I never get tired of hearing Flavor Flav shout, \\"Yeah BOOOOOOOOY!\\", and he does that a lot on that song. Anyway, \\"Louder Than a Bomb\\" is a spectacular protest, with Chuck D dropping great rhymes all over the place. And again, listen to the turntable work. The fusion of rock and rap on \\"She Watch Channel Zero?\\" is okay, but it's just a warm-up act compared to the three songs that come next. Not counting the stupid idiotic interlude/skit \\"Security of the First World\\", we have three old-school hip-hop classics. First is the relentless \\"Night of the Living Baseheads\\", which has some of the fastest rapping I've ever heard. The fact that Chuck D. managed to cram that many words in there without getting tongued-tied is impressive in itself, but it's just a brilliant song in general: the beats; the sax loops; the brief \\"I Can't Get Next to You\\" sample; and the anti-drug lyrics. Debatably my favorite song on this album. Then there's the frightening \\"Black Steel In the Hour of Chaos\\". That piano loop is absolute genius. And the beats! So are they! No way does it feel like six minutes long. Third of these is \\"Rebel without a Pause\\", a rap classic because of the nonstop beat (again), and the synthesizer loop. God, these guys had talent to burn. I don't really like \\"Prophets of Rage\\" or \\"Party For Your Right to Fight\\" much, though. They sound a lot like my several favorite songs on this album, but they're lacking in quality. Still, this may be my favorite rap album. It's excellent. And I don't even like much rap! Yeah, that's right, I don't like much rap (and I sure don't like \\"Crank That\\". No way), and I'm giving this five stars. Does that give you any idea of how GOOD this thing is?s; the brief \\"I Can't Get Next to You\\" sample; and the anti-drug lyrics. Debatably my favorite song on this album.

0143038419|5.0|This book is brilliant!  What a great laugh out loud experience.  Elizabeth Gilbert has been able to actually put into words some of the hilarious tortures of a female lifetime (both fun and not so fun!)  I have been giving this book out to friends and family alike as gifts and have heard nothing but rave reviews back from everyone!
B000UFAURI|5.0|4.5/5  This is a very good cd.  I'll keep this review short and sweet.  The best songs are 1,2,3,6, & 11.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|There are few modern films that capture the true passion of wholesome activities both visually and emotionally. So many films try to entertain their audiences by gratuitous sex, violence and profanity in a race to show the gutter of human existence. Curiously, this film is about the animals of the gutter (rats) and how even the lowest in the class hierarchy can have and pursue grand aspirations.     Although this is an animated film, the richness of physical emotional expression of the characters is far superior to that of most films with live actors these days. Perhaps the separation of acting and speaking necessary for an animated film encourages the animators to express themselves visually while the voices are challenged to rise to the quality of the animation in a healthy, mutually fulfilling competition. It harkens back to the early days of talking cinema when the actors still knew how to express themselves visually from the silent film days. It is possible to watch this film without sound and still enjoy it.     In short, this film is so rich, that I can hardly wait to add it to my collection. It is a film for all ages and I plan on using it in my foreign language classes with dubbing to help them visually connect feelings, and vocabulary directly to the vicissitudes of life without translating. Bravo Pixar and Mr. Bird! Encore!
B000001IPL|3.0|If you know the offspring at all, you know what to expect from this album.  If you don't, here it is: above average rock hymns worth humming to yourself to psyche yourself up with.  \\"Come Out and Play\\" and \\"Self Esteem\\" are probably the two best songs the Offrspring have ever produced.  Overall this album will not revolutionize your music library, but it will add some fun solid rock music worth listening to with the music cracked up.  I don't think this album could disappoint you too much unless you're really expecting far too much from this band, but it might just entertain you a bit more than you'd expect.  Relax, sit back, don't over think this effort and just enjoy the noise.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I was turned on to the White Stripes when my local rock station played some of their songs - so I got Icky Thump and Get Behind Me Satan to try them out.  Icky Thump is... primitive... but in a good way.  The title track is raucous and not at all pop, yet You Don't Know What Love Is is great hard pop music.  I'm also falling in love with Little Cream Soda, though I expect it's not for everyone.  If you like GBMS, I think you'll like Icky Thump.  I'll be picking up the rest of their albums soon, and I hope they're as good.
B00004XPPK|5.0|just saw a smidgin' of this movie and i will be buying this dvd just for this scene where they are setting at a table in a nightclub and rita hayworth is asked to dance....glen ford says no ...but she dances anyway ..to which a man sitting next to ford says one of the greatest lines ever heard in movies and probably in life \\" WOMEN CAN BE EXTREMELY ANOYING \\"
B00006V9A0|3.0|If your like me, and own all of the released Nirvana albums, this is not worth the buy.  I think they left out alot of other great songs.  Buy the 3 CD's + 1 DVD Nirvana Box Set instead.
0812932293|5.0|I have read this book three times.  Branson does business the way we should all aspire to do business.  He has built businesses that he is passionate about.  He enjoys his life and has been exceptionally successful.  I find it to be an inspiring and enjoyable read.  Probably why I have returned to it multiple times.
B000QEIORG|5.0|Foo Fighters' \\"The Colour and the Shape,\\" the album whose singles have gotten more consistent radio airplay than any of the others in the past ten years, has been remastered with the addition of the singles' B-sides.    First, the album itself: We've all heard it, and we know what to expect.  There's the hard rocker \\"Monkey Wrench,\\" the one-two-three punch of \\"Hey, Johnny Park,\\" \\"My Poor Brain,\\" and \\"Wind Up,\\" the slow to screaming \\"February Stars\\" and \\"New Way Home,\\" the boring yet creepy \\"Walking After You,\\" and probably the best song on the album, \\"My Hero.\\"    \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" has more blatantly filler tracks than any other Foo Fighters album: \\"Doll,\\" \\"Up in Arms,\\" \\"See You,\\" and quite possibly the stupidest Foo Fighters song ever (even stupider than \\"Podunk\\"), \\"Enough Space.\\"    Then there's \\"Everlong.\\"  I can't go to one college open mic without some douchebag playing \\"Everlong\\" on his acoustic for his indifferent girlfriend.  Oh, it's a romantic song alright, but a song best enjoyed in private.  All good virgins cry along to \\"Everlong.\\"    On the 2007 version, we get the B-sides.  Foo Fighters probably have the best B-sides of any rock band, and I have quite a few of their singles for this reason.  \\"Fraternity\\" and \\"Normal\\" are two of their best songs, and they're only available (for now) as B-sides.  14. Requiem: 6/10.  It's better than some of the songs that made the album.  The guitar riff gets a bit repetitive though.  15. Drive Me Wild: 7/10.  The only one I hadn't previously heard, and it's rather amusing.  16. Down in the Park: 9/10.  I bought \\"Songs in the Key of X\\" just to hear this one.  It's a very good cover song.  17. Baker Street: 10/10.  The reason you should buy the remastered version \\"The Colour and the Shape.\\"  Yes, it doesn't have as many instruments as the original version of \\"Baker Street,\\" but the guitar alone is amazing.  18. Dear Lover: 2/10.  It's like a slower version of \\"Walking After You,\\" originally released on the \\"Scream 2\\" soundtrack.  Coincidentally, it's about as tedious as \\"Scream 2.\\"  19. The Colour and the Shape: 6/10.  It's rare that a title track isn't good enough to make its own album.  The only other example I can think of is Soul Asylum's \\"Candy from a Stranger.\\"  \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" really fits in better with the Foo Fighters' S/T, or maybe a Nirvana album.    One nice thing about the remastered version is that the booklet contains a historical account from Nate (the bassist).  He says that it's not their best album, just the one the rest get compared to.  He's right; in terms of quality, the album that followed, \\"There Is Nothing Left to Lose,\\" is the Foo Fighters' best album (not just because it won a Grammy).  Still, \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" has its own fumbling charm.

B00000DCHD|4.0|52nd Street is the second installment in the \\"household name\\" trilogy, following The Stranger and preceding Glass Houses. These albums together set him up for life I'm sure. Yielding three singles and more than a few future classic Joel tunes,including the Bosom Buddies theme song \\"My Life\\", 52nd Street is Billy's first #1 album. And it's damn good. Best Male Pop Vocal and Album of the Year Grammys follow.      Featuring his core touring band, the songs sound fresh, energetic, and with Phil Ramone from The Stranger at the helm, the songs stay focused and the studio musicians that augment the tracks are used to great effect. It must have been amazing to record in New York in the late seventies. An orchestra on \\"Honesty\\" and \\"Until the Night\\", a full uncredited horn section on \\"Half a Mile Away\\" arranged by Dave Grusin(the personnel list gives no credit, but the appearance credits list Michael and Randy Brecker among others!), beautiful solos from Freddie Hubbard on \\"Zanzibar\\",etc.      Song to song, Joel never repeats himself musically or lyrically, infusing his pop songs with jazzy sophistication, and the whole album sounds like hits as a result. \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\" is a great love song with a beautiful middle section featuring the Sopranino recorder. And \\"Stiletto\\" has another great middle section with Billy showing off his left hand . Nasty. \\"Zanzibar\\" steals the show with Freddie soaring through its bop  section and coda. Too smooth. \\"Half a Mile Away\\" is the connecting thread from the Little Italy world of The Stranger, and the first three tracks are Joel at his hit making best. \\"Until the Night\\" is the dramatic climax to the album. A great song, but it feels a little over-the-top and out of place with these songs. But Billy brings us back to earth, channeling Ray Charles on the short and sweet jazzy title song. Taken all together it's not as cohesive as The Stranger or albums to come, but still super strong.      Like the other Billy Joel remasters there are promo videos from the time to watch on the PC, and the booklet has lyrics and credits.     Bad cover art. Classic album. A must have for Billy Joel fans.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|There are some problems with this production. It is very beautiful. The photography is stunning, but often distant. It does not have any of the David Attenborough charm. I miss seeing him poking around in the woods, whispering to us about the habits of the creature he is showing us.  I miss his love of nature. This seems to be aimed at those with a short attention span. Its flits from a satellite image to shots from a helicopter, to a creature and then is gone onto something else. I am left with more questions than I find answers. For example, in the Desert episode, we see really amazing images from the Sonoran Desert, then we skip to a satellite image of Utah where there is a quip about there not being much life there and then we are off to see some Nubian Ibex. We don't even get to find out where the ibex are. On the one hand, every image we are presented with is exquisite but on the other, I feel short changed on the intellectual side.  I am half way through the series and will finish it in awe of the photography, but with nagging questions.
B000OQF6N6|1.0|A few months ago I listened to all of the previous SP albums. I was more amazed at how incredible most everything sounded. Great songs. The wheels began to come off on Machina:TMOG. With this, I wasn't expecting much. Unfortunately this is the worst \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" (it ain't real without D'Arcy + Iha) album of them all. I cannot believe how bad it is. Not one good song. If I were the label exec who received this finished product, I would have said sorry Billy, I'm not releasing it. I've already banished it from my memory (not difficult to do with this dull set), and will remember the good times by listening to Gish, or Siamese Dream. This album may have warranted a second star if Corgan had the decency to release this as a solo album or any other iteration of his choosing, but to put this out as a bona fide SP album only serves to damage the legacy of the name. Shame on Billy Corgan. This album is garbage.
B000O77SOK|5.0|While less glamorous than Boston Legal which was a spin-off from this series, the series has some similarities: set in Boston it relates the story of a law firm. However the cases are more realistic and the tone more somber even if at time there as still the same strange cases that you found both in Boston Legal and Ally McBeal. While this box set contains relatively few episodes for reasons explained in other reviews, it is a very very strong series with excellent acting and writing.
B000TLYEP2|2.0|I am a long time fan of this band, but I´m disappointed with quality of this Japanese 2007 Reissue. Other Universal titles as Lynyrd Skynyrd for example the sound is very superior than ABB 2007 reissue.      The Package is excellent, lyrics both English and Japanese, but the quality of sound could be better. 2 Stars.

B000EULJLU|5.0|People's favorite Tool albums seem to be a mix of the three latest, probably with a lean on Aenima.  However, this album is rediculously fantastic, and in my opinion, the best of them all.  With any luck, their next release will be even better...and my unfortunately the awesomeness would cause my head to implode.    Right of the bat, \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Jambi\\" catch the listener's attention with mind blowing riffs on both the guitar and bass, and of course, Danny Carey reminds every drummer why they envy his ridiculous talent.  The 5/4 time on Vicarious makes it a little more listener friendly to the casual music fan, but actually, I really don't care whether they like tool or not and shouldn't have mentioned these bums in the first place.  If you are smart, you will stop reading my review right now.    The Epic \\"Wings for Marie\\" (divided into two tracks, the 2nd of which is the album's title) is a fantastic listen when you're alone at your computer and ignoring your work.  There's a brief, explosive moment in the first part that is particularly captivating, and the long intro to \\"10,000 Days\\" with the echoing drum hit on the 2nd beat every so often is one of the coolest atmospheric effects I've ever heard.  From there, the song will destroy your soul.    Maynard's distinct intro vocals to \\"The Pot\\" have been aired on radio stations since the album was released, but this isn't a bad thing (in fact, it's one of the only good songs that gets playtime on radio stations).  The Pot is definetely a stand out on the album being both very catchy (\\"You must have been....so....high\\"), and one hell of a composition.    \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" is fairly dismissable; it's neat to hear the indigenous interest, but it's just an interlude.  \\"The Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)\\", however, is a great into to \\"Rosetta Stoned\\".  It's just guitar over ambient noise, but a story is created when you hear voices of a doctor and a nurse in a hospital trying to coax a patient into talking.  Rosetta Stonedis the patient's story, and is another monster of a song on this CD.    Frankly, after this point, I don't remember much.  \\"Intension\\" is a long, mellow song, and \\"Right in Two\\" is another soft-heavy-soft song.  \\"Virgini Tres\\" is not really anything; I'd probably need an explanation from the band about the closing track to care about it at all.    Overall- buy the damn CD.  It's amazing, and your ears will love you for the rest of your life for giving them this gift.  Oh, and go learn to play an instrument if you havn't already.  You'll enjoy it.
0553805460|5.0|\\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" journeys into the deepest recesses of Jordan Belfort's mind. His moral transgressions hurt many people, but mostly destroyed him (from the inside out). He is a grand story-teller in the tradition of Thomas Wolfe or James Joyce, painting a masterpiece of drugs, drinking, and the debauchery that marked his promise and destroyed his life. He reads like a character from modern fiction, living to excess that would have killed most men, featuring daily cocktails quaaludes, hookers, fast cars, and wasted money that wrestled him to a dark moment where he tried to erase his being from the record books. His book is a surprising read, one of the best first books I've ever read. Highly recommended.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I wish all of them could be like this one. Only it would make this one look less good. Sooo... nevermind I guess. Priceless performances, laughs, drama, everything. Simply the best.     A middle aged woman from my Bible-belt home town told me she thought the climax was filthy/terrible. Anyone that believes this has utterly missed the point. If you GET this movie (it's easy, so I hope you do) you'll cherish it forever.
B000002UB3|3.0|Product came one day later than predicted.  The CD is what I wanted and is a great oldie.
B00005JPCF|2.0|I really enjoyed the first half of Happy Feet (except for the very annoying \\"Norma Jean\\" Nicole Kidman character).  The animation is great, the penguins were delightful and the story was progressing nicely then all of a sudden we have a shift to propaganda for environmental causes, our hero imprisoned and going slightly mad and being down trodden by his own tribe once again.  I finished watching this movie wondering who it was targeted at and feeling far from happy, almost depressed. Not a kid's movie at all.
B000001ZS3|5.0|Way before we had Autechre, Aphex Twin, and the Orb, electronic music was it's most innovative during the 1970's.<br /><br />The best way to start to buy Jean Michel Jarre albums, is to start with his greatest achievements.  \\"Oxygene\\" (1976), \\"Equinoxe\\" (1978), \\"Les Chants Magnetiques (Magnetic Fields)\\" (1981), and then jump to \\"Chronologie\\" (1993).<br /><br />One thing that I loved about the 1970's is that artists all had the liberty to do whatever they wanted to do.  Nobody was told that they had to make music that sounded like whatever was popular at the time.  If you were really different, then you were given that chance to expressive your own new concept of sound art.  Today, if you try to do something different, then you get immediately categorized, and probably end up in the \\"not likely to sell\\" file.  Today, record companies seem to be very selective on what they are willing to invest in and record.  That's probably why we have so many independent labels now.  The big recording industries like Columbia, Capitol, and RCA are probably just relying on the sales of repackage hits of their former successful artists.<br /><br />Anyway, Jean Michel Jarre was one of the outsiders who was entering the spacy soundscape concept similar to Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Tomita, Mike Oldfield, and even Vangelis.  I love the innovators of electronic music of the seventies, and Jean Michel Jarre became my favorite when I first started buying CD's in the eighties.  The new compact disc concept was perfect for re-introducing electronic music.  This album of \\"Oxygene\\" was one of my first CD's that I bought in 1984.  I've never played another cassette tape again, although I've made cassette tape recording to give to friends so I could introduce them to Jean Michel Jarre, and other electronic artists, too.<br /><br />However, Jean Michel Jarre must truly have been struggling these passed 15 years. He has his own unique sound, and yet he's been trying to stay alive for more than 30 years.  I can see his confusion though.  His most loyal fans have a particular expectation of what music he creates.  And nobody can be expected to just continue to do the same thing over and over again.  \\"Oxygene\\", \\"Equinoxe\\", and \\"Magnetic Fields\\" were the albums that set the stage for what was Jarre's fabulous unique sound.  But, all through his career he seemed to want to re-create himself.  He did a weird soundtrack album in 1973 called \\"Les Granges Brulees\\" which only recently got released on CD a couple of years ago.  I didn't like it and I'm sure Jarre himself is not too fond of it.  However, in 1976, his illustrious career began with \\"Oxygene\\", which is probably still his most famous album.  Anyone who has \\"Oxygene\\" probably has \\"Equinoxe\\" as well.  Anything he released after this, we couldn't wait to buy.  Then, he caught us all off guard in 1984 with \\"Zoolook\\" This took a little while to grow on me, but eventually, it did.  It also made me a little hesitant about his next album.  In 1986, he put out \\"Rendez-vous\\" and redeemed himself, and our expectations.  Then, it seemed like he was beginning to get sloppy.  He has released a lot of live albums and I thought that he was just killing time with all those unnecessary releases.  I enjoy 1982's \\"The Concerts in China\\", and I've kept his other double live CD of 1994's \\"Hong Kong\\".  But he has several other live albums that just seemed to repeat the same sound as the previous studio releases, but with half-hearted applause from the listening audience.<br /><br />In 1988, his album \\"Revolutions\\" had some great short passages, and then some rather dumb child-like sound concepts.  Then in 1990, his album \\"Waiting for Cousteau\\" had two fabulous instrumentals called \\"Calypso 2 and 3\\"  (I didn't care for Calypso 1\\") and then his title track is his first truly ambient sound passage.  He did a nearly 47 minute soundscape which simulated lying on the ocean floor and listening to the sounds of passing sea mammals and other underwater sound effects.  I do like it, but I gotta be in the mood to listen to it.  When I'm tired and I want to sit in the dark and listen to something, this track is pretty soothing and relaxing.<br /><br />Then, in 1993, he puts out an album called \\"Chronologie\\".  To me this is his greatest album since his first three albums.  This is one of my top five favorite albums from Jean Michel Jarre.  I was thinking: \\"Yes! The Jean Michel Jarre that we all knew, is back!\\"  But, then, after this album, I think Jarre was beginning to get confused.  He didn't quite do anything for a while.  Maybe he was basking in the glow of his new latest sound achievement, and now he didn't know how to follow up on it.  Two years afterwards, he releases another double live album called \\"Hong Kong\\".  I like it because he incorporated a band to add more energy to his familiar music of the past and so it was nice to hear a concert that featured the music of all his best albums.  I wish this concert was filmed for video.  What a loss that is.<br /><br />A year later, somebody tampers with Jarre's music and created a various remix album called \\"Jarremix\\".

In 1997, he releases an album called \\"Oxygene 7 -13\\".  This album sounds like he's trying to resell his most cherished album by simulating some of the sounds of the original album.  It's a keeper, but I don't know why Jarre felt like he had to do this.

When I'm tired and I want to sit in the dark and listen to something, this track is pretty soothing and relaxing.    Then, in 1993, he puts out an album called \\"Chronologie\\".  To me this is his greatest album since his first three albums.  This is one of my top five favorite albums from Jean Michel Jarre.  I was thinking: \\"Yes! The Jean Michel Jarre that we all knew, is back!\\"  But, then, after this album, I think Jarre was beginning to get confused.  He didn't quite do anything for a while.  Maybe he was basking in the glow of his new latest sound achievement, and now he didn't know how to follow up on it.  Two years afterwards, he releases another double live album called \\"Hong Kong\\".

0694003611|5.0|I give this book as a baby shower gift or a birthday gift to my friends' kids who are 5 and under. It's a sure favorite.
B000001ZS5|5.0|The best way to start to buy Jean Michel Jarre albums, is to start with his greatest achievements.  \\"Oxygene\\" (1976), \\"Equinoxe\\" (1978), \\"Les Chants Magnetiques (Magnetic Fields)\\" (1981), and then jump to \\"Chronologie\\" (1993).<br /><br />One thing that I loved about the 1970's is that artists all had the liberty to do whatever they wanted to do.  Nobody was told that they had to make music that sounded like whatever was popular at the time.  If you were really different, then you were given that chance to expressive your own new concept of sound art.  Today, if you try to do something different, then you get immediately categorized, and probably end up in the \\"not likely to sell\\" file.  Today, record companies seem to be very selective on what they are willing to invest in and record.  That's probably why we have so many independent labels now.  The big recording industries like Columbia, Capitol, and RCA are probably just relying on the sales of repackage hits of their former successful artists.<br /><br />Anyway, Jean Michel Jarre was one of the outsiders who was entering the spacy soundscape concept similar to Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Tomita, Mike Oldfield, and even Vangelis.  I love the innovators of electronic music of the seventies, and Jean Michel Jarre became my favorite when I first started buying CD's in the eighties.  The new compact disc concept was perfect for re-introducing electronic music.  The album of \\"Oxygene\\" was one of my first CD's that I bought in 1984. Then I bought \\"Equinoxe\\" and then this album. I've never played another cassette tape again, although I've made cassette tape recording to give to friends so I could introduce them to Jean Michel Jarre, and other electronic artists, too.<br /><br />However, Jean Michel Jarre must truly have been struggling these passed 15 years. He has his own unique sound, and yet he's been trying to stay alive for more than 30 years.  I can see his confusion though.  His most loyal fans have a particular expectation of what music he creates.  And nobody can be expected to just continue to do the same thing over and over again.  \\"Oxygene\\", \\"Equinoxe\\", and \\"Magnetic Fields\\" were the albums that set the stage for what was Jarre's fabulous unique sound.  But, all through his career he seemed to want to re-create himself.  He did a weird soundtrack album in 1973 called \\"Les Granges Brulees\\" which only recently got released on CD a couple of years ago.  I didn't like it and I'm sure Jarre himself is not too fond of it.  However, in 1976, his illustrious career began with \\"Oxygene\\", which is probably still his most famous album.  Anyone who has \\"Oxygene\\" probably has \\"Equinoxe\\" as well.  Anything he released after this, we couldn't wait to buy.  Then, he caught us all off guard in 1984 with \\"Zoolook\\" This took a little while to grow on me, but eventually, it did.  It also made me a little hesitant about his next album.  In 1986, he put out \\"Rendez-vous\\" and redeemed himself, and our expectations.  Then, it seemed like he was beginning to get sloppy.  He has released a lot of live albums and I thought that he was just killing time with all those unnecessary releases.  I enjoy 1982's \\"The Concerts in China\\", and I've kept his other double live CD of 1994's \\"Hong Kong\\".  But he has several other live albums that just seemed to repeat the same sound as the previous studio releases, but with half-hearted applause from the listening audience.<br /><br />In 1988, his album \\"Revolutions\\" had some great short passages, and then some rather dumb child-like sound concepts.  Then in 1990, his album \\"Waiting for Cousteau\\" had two fabulous instrumentals called \\"Calypso 2 and 3\\"  (I didn't care for Calypso 1\\") and then his title track is his first truly ambient sound passage.  He did a nearly 47 minute soundscape which simulated lying on the ocean floor and listening to the sounds of passing sea mammals and other underwater sound effects.  I do like it, but I gotta be in the mood to listen to it.  When I'm tired and I want to sit in the dark and listen to something, this track is pretty soothing and relaxing.<br /><br />Then, in 1993, he puts out an album called \\"Chronologie\\".

The series is advertised as a children's series, but its about as children's series as the Narnia chronicles. Sure children will love the books, but to really understand MR. Pullman's main ideas and motifs, one must be old enough to know of religion and love and more \\"adult\\" themes. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to have a book to read while sipping coco near a fire(after all, winters almost here), but beware: if you are not willing to read this series, and especially this book, with an open mind, you will find it blasphemous and degrading to religion. But read it with no thought of such issues, and you just might be reading something truly bigger than Narnia.
B000001ZSF|5.0|Jean Michel Jarre has been recording and performing live for more than 30 years.  If you like Klaus Schulze's 1970's work, then you should check out Jean Michel Jarre's innovative electronica.<br /><br />This is my last favorite album from Jean Michel Jarre.  I would think that he would have the sense to know this too.  This album represents all that we've loved about Jean Michel Jarre's music.  He can proudly endorse this sound as his own.<br /><br />The best way to start to buy Jean Michel Jarre albums, is to start with his greatest achievements.  \\"Oxygene\\" (1976), \\"Equinoxe\\" (1978), \\"Les Chants Magnetiques (Magnetic Fields)\\" (1981), and then jump to \\"Chronologie\\" (1993).<br /><br />One thing that I loved about the 1970's is that artists all had the liberty to do whatever they wanted to do.  Nobody was told that they had to make music that sounded like whatever was popular at the time.  If you were really different, then you were given that chance to expressive your own new concept of sound art.  Today, if you try to do something different, then you get immediately categorized, and probably end up in the \\"not likely to sell\\" file.  Today, record companies seem to be very selective on what they are willing to invest in and record.  That's probably why we have so many independent labels now.  The big recording industries like Columbia, Capitol, and RCA are probably just relying on the sales of repackage hits of their former successful artists.<br /><br />Anyway, Jean Michel Jarre was one of the outsiders who was entering the spacy soundscape concept similar to Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Tomita, Mike Oldfield, and even Vangelis.  I love the innovators of electronic music of the seventies, and Jean Michel Jarre became my favorite when I first started buying CD's in the eighties.  The new compact disc concept was perfect for re-introducing electronic music.  The album of \\"Oxygene\\" was one of my first CD's that I bought in 1984.  I've never played another cassette tape again, although I've made cassette tape recording to give to friends so I could introduce them to Jean Michel Jarre, and other electronic artists, too.<br /><br />However, Jean Michel Jarre must truly have been struggling these passed 15 years. He has his own unique sound, and yet he's been trying to stay alive for more than 30 years.  I can see his confusion though.  His most loyal fans have a particular expectation of what music he creates.  And nobody can be expected to just continue to do the same thing over and over again.  \\"Oxygene\\", \\"Equinoxe\\", and \\"Magnetic Fields\\" were the albums that set the stage for what was Jarre's fabulous unique sound.  But, all through his career he seemed to want to re-create himself.  He did a weird soundtrack album in 1973 called \\"Les Granges Brulees\\" which only recently got released on CD a couple of years ago.  I didn't like it and I'm sure Jarre himself is not too fond of it.  However, in 1976, his illustrious career began with \\"Oxygene\\", which is probably still his most famous album.  Anyone who has \\"Oxygene\\" probably has \\"Equinoxe\\" as well.  Anything he released after this, we couldn't wait to buy.  Then, he caught us all off guard in 1984 with \\"Zoolook\\" This took a little while to grow on me, but eventually, it did.  It also made me a little hesitant about his next album.  In 1986, he put out \\"Rendez-vous\\" and redeemed himself, and our expectations.  Then, it seemed like he was beginning to get sloppy.  He has released a lot of live albums and I thought that he was just killing time with all those unnecessary releases.  I enjoy 1982's \\"The Concerts in China\\", and I've kept his other double live CD of 1994's \\"Hong Kong\\".  But he has several other live albums that just seemed to repeat the same sound as the previous studio releases, but with half-hearted applause from the listening audience.<br /><br />In 1988, his album \\"Revolutions\\" had some great short passages, and then some rather dumb child-like sound concepts.  Then in 1990, his album \\"Waiting for Cousteau\\" had two fabulous instrumentals called \\"Calypso 2 and 3\\"  (I didn't care for Calypso 1\\") and then his title track is his first truly ambient sound passage.  He did a nearly 47 minute soundscape which simulated lying on the ocean floor and listening to the sounds of passing sea mammals and other underwater sound effects.  I do like it, but I gotta be in the mood to listen to it.  When I'm tired and I want to sit in the dark and listen to something, this track is pretty soothing and relaxing.<br /><br />Then, in 1993, he puts out an album called \\"Chronologie\\".  To me this is his greatest album since his first three albums.  This is one of my top five favorite albums from Jean Michel Jarre.  I was thinking: \\"Yes! The Jean Michel Jarre that we all knew, is back!\\"  But, then, after this album, I think Jarre was beginning to get confused.  He didn't quite do anything for a while.  Maybe he was basking in the glow of his new latest sound achievement, and now he didn't know how to follow up on it.  Two years afterwards, he releases another double live album called \\"Hong Kong\\".  I like it because he incorporated a band to add more energy to his familiar music of the past and so it was nice to hear a concert that featured the music of all his best albums.  I wish this concert was filmed for video.  What a loss that is.<br /><br />A year later, somebody tampers with Jarre's music and created a various remix album called \\"Jarremix\\".  I don't think Jarre had much participation in creating these remixes other that just the rhythms of certain tracks.  This is another CD that I have to be in the mood for.  I seldom ever care to play this CD.<br /><br />With Jarre suddenly realizing that he's tapped into a multitude of different directions, he came to a halt on his creativity.  So, check this out.  In 1997, he releases an album called \\"Oxygene 7 -13\\".  This album sounds like he's trying to resell his most cherished album by simulating some of the sounds of the original album.  It's a keeper, but I don't know why Jarre felt like he had to do this.  Maybe he knew that it couldn't help but sell well because he IS Jean Michel Jarre and \\"Oxygene\\" WAS he greatest selling album.  You know, Mike Oldfield did this too.  In 1973, his first album \\"Tubular Bells\\" was his greatest selling album, with his career continuing a moderate downward direction of appeal, in 1992 he released an album called \\"Tubular Bells 2\\" which brought his earlier fan base back (including me).  And in 1998, he even did a \\"Tubular Bells 3\\" and then he did \\"Tubular Bells 2003\\" which proves that he has lost his grip with what he wants to put out for his fan base.  Anyway, I was wondering if Jarre was going to put out an album called \\"Equinoxe 9 - 17\\".  He may as well, I'm sure it would sell.<br /><br />I have mixed opinions about Jarre's new millenium album called \\"Metamorphoses\\".  The long album side soundscapes are no more.  He's starting to stick to just a bunch of short songs.  And he incorporates female voices in many of the songs. It's hit and miss with these tunes.  Mostly miss.  Then he comes out with \\"Sessions 2000\\".  This album does not sound like Jean Michel Jarre at all.  This whole boring concept sounds like the sounds you could invent in your own head if you were sitting forever in a waiting room, or you were in silent solitary confinement.  Then his next album \\"Geometry of Love\\" continued the same dull concept.  Two bland, boorish, CD's in a row and neither one even worthy of being released in a regular jewel case.<br /><br />Yes, the days of Jarre's greatest moments are all truly over.  I believe it ended with \\"Chonologie.\\"  If you're new to hearing Jean Michel Jarre's music, start with \\"Oxygene\\", \\"Equinoxe\\", \\"Les Chants Magnetiques (Magnetic Fields),\\" and the \\"Chronolgie\\".  You won't be disappointed.  But it's up to you where you go from there.\\" had two fabulous instrumentals called \\"Calypso 2 and 3\\"  (I didn't care for Calypso 1\\") and then his title track is his first truly ambient sound passage.

B0000AK7AC|4.0|BABE is a wonderful movie, but this DVD does not allow the viewer to skip thru the previews. Once the movie begins you can skip around, but you have to sit thru a bunch of previews EVERY TIME your kid watches this movie.
0743486285|5.0|After reading the Dirt, I knew what I was in for.  I have been waiting for this book to come out since the idea of it was thrown around.  The wait was worth it!  From page to page we learn of Nikki's personal demons to his wild parties.  The best part of this detailed novel is when Nikki goes to rehab and he says \\"F**K God and F88K you\\" as he jumps out of the window and starts to walk home to get his next fix.  This novel has it all; humor, darkness, emotion, and many stories that only a true superhero could have survived.  Pick it up today
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Even 30 plus years on this is a very watchable, powerful and comprehensive account of World War II.  Ken Burns talks about the gallant myth he is smashing with his latest PBS release \\"The War\\".  Anyone who has watched this series by Thames Television or any of the WW2 related BBC documentaries, is already under no such illusions.  If there's one thing the British do well, its sober, informative documentary film-making (but hey, I'm biased).
B000006IUQ|3.0|Its a typical story, however the view and the scenes of the forest is just so amazing and beautiful! Interesting smart tips on how to survive being lost in the forest. Overall its more of a cinema movie and a 1 time see!
0061367036|5.0|This book is not just for those who are fans of the CW show Supernatural.  Eric Kripke, creator of the show, prides himself on the validity of the legends and myths he uses in his show.  This book gives background information about things encounted by the Winchesters with a few new critters added in.  The text uses Sam and Dean's voices for each section and fans of the show can easily pick out which Winchester is speaking each time.  This book is a must for those who want to learn more about urban legends and things that roam the night.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This is my absolutely favorite Sci-fi movie.  Leslie Nielson stars along with Water Pidgeon, Anne Francis, Earl Holliman, Jack Kelly, Richard Anderson.  Each of these actors we will see in movies and television in later years and parts of this set will appear in future sci-fi movies and shows.  Even Robby the Robot shows up in bits and pieces as the robot in the series \\"Lost in Space\\".      One of the first sci-fi movies that was done on a big budget, Forbidden Planet is loosely based on Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\".  For the time, this is a very beautiful and imaginative movie, tho I do find the idea of Earl Holliman as a space-traveling cook for the crew still wearing an apron and acting like a cook on the wagon train somewhat unbelievable and kinda funny.    This is a movie that makes a statement about how we as humans (and apparently the Krell too) can be our own worst enemies.
1401211909|4.0|Pretty good book.  I like the depth that it goes into on some areas, but the ending is quite odd.  There is a definite difference between the movie and the book, but both are worth your time.  The pictures are beautiful and it is just a pleasure to have such an enchanting small world to escape into.  I recommend this book to anyone who has a heart for a world that doesn't rely on reason.
B000002LFZ|5.0|If I had to take 1 album with me onto a deserted island, it would be this.  It is a great compilation of Fleetwood's best.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|I don't understand why the studio decided to release this film as two separate films. After the release of this film old Grindhouse movies from the 70's began being released which actually have TWO films per single disc. The total running time of the theatrical version was about 3 hours with awesome trailers mixed in. It isn't a Grindhouse experience unless both films are integrated. The theatrical version was so much fun, this was a huge mistake on the part of the studio. But I'll bet you a million bucks in about 6 months we'll see the film re-released in theatrical version. 1 disc with both films and 1 disc with extra features.   What were you people THINKING?!
B000002GFC|5.0|If you like classic rock, Cream is one of those bands you can't avoid.  A number of their songs helped define classic rock.  This compilations is solid.  Has everything you'll want.
0143038419|2.0|I am motivated to pursue writing from my experience after reading this. While amusing, inspiring and enlivening I feel it could have been best told at half its paper space.    Written by a young and ambitious writer the book has had major impact on many young women, we are living in a golden age of stream of consciousness publishing based on the ability to put pen to paper.    Let this book be a lesson to all: if you feel you can do it, you can; the success of this book proves this however, there is a far longer and higher road to Greatness.
B000002MFE|4.0|It's a good album from beginning to end.  But if you like Clapton's older stuff (Cream, Derek & the Dominoes) then you may be a little disappointed by the fact it's unplugged.

B00005JKHP|1.0|The Star Trek motion picture series should have began with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. They should have never put out this disaster of a movie. I can't really think of any redeeming quality this film has except the fact it reunited the old Star Trek crew.    It appears they just put together a lot of special effects, and then somewhere towards the end decided, \\"Hey, we probably need to have a story, too.\\" I'm surprised this bomb of a film didn't kill off the entire franchise.    The worst thing about The Motion Picture is the wait for such in anticlimactic ending. The grandiose music, the long, overblown introduction of the Enterprise, the overall epic feel of the film, all add up to a climax that falls flat on its face. You keep waiting for something interesting to happen and it just doesn't.    I actually enjoyed Star Trek V more than this one, even though Star Trek V is widely considered the weakest entry overall it at least has some interesting character development and moves a lot more briskly than this plodding piece does.    Overall, unless you're purchasing this movie as part of the box set that includes all ten Star Trek movies, do yourself a favor and skip this one. As I said earlier, the movie releases should have began with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.
B000000W5N|4.0|The Stones have better stuff, but this is worth listening to them.  An album that shows their growth as a band.
B000UFAURI|5.0|This band amazes me. The first two Foo Fighter albums were excellent, but I found myself wondering where this band could go from there. They couldn't get too experimental or they just wouldn't be the Foo Fighters anymore. Fortunately they surprised me with each subsequent release. After The Colour and the Shape, the Foo's went on to make one solid album after another by continuing with the elements that made them great, but also expanding their creativity just enough so that their music sounded fresh. ESP&G is no exception. Whereas some bands get restless and try to completely redefine themselves, the Foo's have allowed themselves to mature slowly over time. I hate to use the cliche, but they are like a fine wine that gets better with age. I'm not saying that the more recent albums are better than the earlier ones. When I say they are getting better I mean that they are able to continue putting out great music without getting stale and they've done this by not completely going away from the sound that made them succesful in the first place. Dave Grohl just has a knack for making great music that fits perfectly with the time period in which it was made. No one wants another Colour and Shape; that's already been done and it stands alone as a classic album. But, people still expect this band to put out great material. Simply stated, the Foo's always sound fresh and relevant for the times. ESP&G has a more mature sound, but it's still recognizable as a Foo Fighter album. They're a little older and a little wiser, but they still know how to rock. Whereas once I couldn't envision them going much further, it now appears that there's no stopping them. I think Dave and his bandmates will be fighting foo for a long time to come.

B00008973Q|5.0|(This review is for the Masterworks edition.)<br /><br />This is the type of film that's so intense and powerful that afterwards the viewer may feel like s/he needs to unwind emotionally, to recover and come down from such a powerhouse of a cinematic experience.  It's also the type of film that just gets better and better with each new viewing, as the viewer becomes more and more familiar with the story and characters and keeps picking up on new things s/he might not have paid much attention to before.  And though the film is over two and a half hours long, it's one of those films where the time goes by like that, not a dull or wasted moment.  Even those who haven't read 'King Lear' can enjoy the story and get into it, though familiarity with the play does help a bit in one's understanding of some of the basics.  Shakespeare really was a writer for all time, with his play able to be adopted so well hundreds of years later in an entirely different culture and milieu, the story of the old king and his three children just as compelling and relevant when it's transformed into a tale of feudal Japan.  And while there are some things which are left out, most of the story stays pretty faithful to the original.  One of the slight changes I loved was how the character of the Fool was a much more important character; when I first studied the play as a highschool senior, my entire class and even the teacher really liked that character and didn't understand why he just disappears so suddenly before the play is even over.  I can't think of a single flaw in this film; the pacing is great, the color and cinematography are beautiful, there are so many great characters, everyone's acting is great, the music is very powerful (particularly during the scene of the battle at the Third Castle midway through, when there's no sound except for the music), and the themes are ones for all time, just as relevant today as they were in feudal Japan or when the film was made.  Overall, it's the type of film one can't really appreciate the greatness of for oneself until one actually sees it.  Hearing a lot of words of praise just can't hold a candle to having that experience for oneself.<br /><br />The extras are trailers, weblinks, a demo of the restoration used (the difference between the color on this version and the earlier one is stunning), a filmography, production notes, and audio commentaries.  Of the commentaries, my favorite was the one by Stephen Price, which added a lot to the viewing of the film.  The second one, by Peter Grilli, has its moments, but is more about the making of the film and Kurosawa's personality than the actual story itself, in contrast to the other commentary.  There are also way too many long, long, long pauses in this commentary, so it doesn't add as much to one's understanding and appreciation of the film.  Since I don't really understand or deeply care about the differences between certain types of aspect ratios, I can't really comment on the version used for this transfer, but it does sound like the print used on the newer Criterion edition is even more beautiful than this one.  The extras on that version also sound far superior to the extras on the Masterworks edition, so it seems like the Criterion DVD is the only one to get for those who love this film and want it to get the deluxe treatment it deserves.ilm one can't really appreciate the greatness of for oneself until one actually sees it.

0618871713|5.0|When your father is an exacting home renovator, meticulous interior decorator, local mortician, high shcool English teacher, and closeted homosexual, who you suspect likely had sexual relations with adolescent boys - if you're like most autobiopic authors these days, then you'd probably write your own private hyperbolic \\"Running With Scissors,\\" throwing everything up against the wall, and crudely splattering your immediate family's history across the pages of your tunnel-visioned, self-promoting, and sensational memoir.  But Alison Bechdel is neither an ordinary author nor a poorly educated one.  She has both an independently crafted intellect and a capable library of classic literary sources and themes.  She does not choose to focus on minutia or overly far-reaching causalities.  Her first autobiography is a corncopia of expertly-coordinated art forms, carved into a concise, gravitational, and enlightening narrative.<br /><br />I highly recommend not only buying and reading this book, but I also encourage studying Bechdel's perspectives, reasoning connections, and causal theories.<br /><br />This book is a modern heroic quest to find meanings, understandings, and truths in intimate behaviors, wants, and relationships.<br /><br />Many authors focus on picturesquely and emotionally describing the abnormalities of their past.  Bechdel is fully capable of parroting those common abilities.  But her aims are further reaching and more well-intended than simply trying for accurate multi-sensory recollection.  She goes happily beyond and effectively reveals the origins of some of her creative forces.  She sympathetically and honestly portrays the cultural, familial, and private paradoxes that likely disabled so many of her (and our) loved ones who are not ordinary in their desires.<br /><br />Anyone who incorrectly thinks women can't be visually-centric need only read this book. Bechdel's visual memory is both astounding and rewarding for the rest of us.  And her other areas of memory, from smells to feelings to current events to literary quotes in her educational development are indicative of an artist who tries to consider, evaluate, and remember more than most people do.  She does not filter her memories through rose colored glasses, but she does effectively step outside status quo lenses to make her own evaluations and portrayals.<br /><br />Reading some of the recent popular homosexual memoirs, a person might think homosexuals are NOT predominantly driven by love or desire, but rather driven by poor experiences, revenge, whistleblowing, or hatred.  Where most authors blame their family and past relationships for their own problems, Bechdel does not.  She sees more perspectives and she is better educated than most.  Bechdel chooses to not simply blame others for her past OCD, inabilities, and abnormalities, even while she illustrates capably the environment in which those conditions arose.<br /><br />The title \\"Fun Home\\" probably has many intended meanings, like Jeannette Wells memoir entitled \\"The Glass Castle\\" has many transparent meanings.  Both memoirs speak of fun times, but I think Bechdel sees even more of the good intentions in her father's \\"mad\\" pursuits than Wells perceived.  Both fathers showed flashes of brilliance mixed with Achilles Heels so notorious, it's a wonder they could walk at all sometimes.  And in Wells' defense, at least Bechdel's father was better read and less often intoxicated.<br /><br />The title \\"Fun Home\\" is not singularly intended with negative or sarcastic connotations.  Alison Bechdel shows us how she had fun growing up, as much fun as a person could have dealing with the ever present spoken and unspoken, addressed and unaddressed familial conflicts constantly battling in her home.<br /><br />I think it would be insufficent to call this a young woman's \\"coming of age\\" book.  It may be more accurate to say this book is about a family coming of age.  And I think the publication of this beautiful story is an assertive exercise in encouraging societal sensibilities to come of age.<br /><br />Bechdel does not seek to excuse all of her father's behaviors, but rather to help others understand them.  She wants more people to understand what can happen to very intelligent and talented people when they are incorrectly trained to believe that some of their primary drives and loves are sinful, shameful, or should be killed or hidden.  She writes:<br /><br />\\"I suppose a lifetime spent hiding one's erotic truth could have a cummulative renunciatory effect.  Sexual shame is in itself a kind of death.  Ulysses, of course, was banned for many years by people who found its honesty obscene.\\"<br /><br />I felt pretty good that I was able to not cry while reading the book.

She writes:    \\"I suppose a lifetime spent hiding one's erotic truth could have a cummulative renunciatory effect.  Sexual shame is in itself a kind of death.  Ulysses, of course, was banned for many years by people who found its honesty obscene.\\"    I felt pretty good that I was able to not cry while reading the book.

B00005JPTA|5.0|Viggo Mortensen is at the center of David Cronenberg's \\"Eastern Promises\\" and as such all the characters and the plot points surround him as a Cobra surrounds it's prey. Far from a victim though Mortensen's Nikolai, a low level Chauffeur for the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;'s closeted homosexual son of clan leader, Armin Mueller-Stahl, played by whacked-out Vincent Chassell, Nikolai is all seeing, all doing: he is an enforcer capable of doing the worse kind of jobs in this world without flinching and in several scenes Cronenberg stretches the bounds of good taste but somehow always manages not to snap them.<br />Naomi Watts is also on hand here as a Russian/English mid-wife, Anna and she brings empathy and humanity to this world of depravity, lust and violence. She also sees a kindred spirit in Nikolai though on the surface he is anything but.<br />Mortensen's Nikolai is a superbly complicated character: cynical, intelligent, world-weary and tough enough to stub out a cigarette on his tongue.<br />The centerpiece of \\"Eastern Promises\\" is Nikolai's attack in a steam bath by Chechen/Armani clad hit men bent on killing him. Nikolai is nude, his assailants are not. The scene goes on for a number of minutes and it is both violent and beautiful with Cronenberg's camera flying above capturing all the grandeur of his mise en scene.<br />The world of \\"Eastern Promises\\" is much more complicated than that of \\"A History of Violence\\" wherein small town values were contrasted with big city perversities. In \\"Eastern Promises,\\" Cronenberg is after bigger fish: the natural order of things is questioned, the underworld is brought squealing and squirming into the light.<br />Cronenberg has a lot on his plate here dealing with not only the disenfranchised natural born English but also those forced into slavery by the Russian mob and brought to England to satisfy the mercurial as well as the sexual needs of a western nation. Angels vs. Devils, Good vs. Evil: it's all here in this elegiac, gorgeously photographed film, Cronenberg's most cogent, most visceral, most rhapsodic.Cronenberg's most cogent, most visceral, most rhapsodic.

0345494768|5.0|[[ASIN:0345494768 The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film (Star  Wars)]]    I was four years old when the original \\"Star Wars\\" was released, and like so many kids of that generation, that film and its two sequels defined an enormous part of my childhood.  Even though I didn't know it at the time, it introduced me to the \\"best bits\\" of classical mythology, while being a visual catalyst for my imagination (and years of subsequent role-play, particularly in Upstate New York, where re-enacting ice planet Hoth after \\"Empire\\" came out was all too easy...).    As I grew older (I hesitate to use the phrase \\"grew up,\\" as I'm not sure it's happened yet), I came to appreciate more than just the adventure and dynamic visuals that \\"Star Wars\\" represented; it was my \\"gateway drug\\" into wanting to learn more about how movies were made.  I remember all of the TV specials of that era that pulled back the curtain on the filmmaking process, particularly with regard to the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, and I couldn't get enough information.  That hunger became the same kind of obsession that's typically associated with \\"Star Wars\\" fans, and I absorbed every scrap of detail I could find, from Ralph McQuarrie's concept art, to model photos, to script pages, and even before the Internet made it only a matter of a few clicks to access such information, there was a wealth of it, when it came to \\"Star Wars.\\"    Fast forward to 2007; \\"Star Wars\\" is 30 years old, a whole separate trilogy has come and gone, and my own children are budding \\"Star Wars\\" fans for their own reasons.  I figured I knew pretty much all there was to know about this film.  I darn well should have, for as much time as I had spent (and continue to spend) over the years actively seeking out new details about it.  Then came this book; I didn't know anything.    This is dense, dense reading, covering every minute detail about every aspect of production of the original \\"Star Wars,\\" from draftingthe script, to getting it taken seriously by Hollywood, to assembling the team that would revolutionize filmmaking as we came to know it.  This is a wonderful thing.  I find myself poring over every word, every image, every caption and footnote, just as I did as a child who was learning about film for the first time.  It is an amazing tribute, an insanely detailed reference volume, and most incredible of all, a unique representation of a film that has been covered in so many ways by so many authors, that finding anything new to talk about seemed impossible.    The aspect of this book I personally find most exciting is that all of the interviews that comprise it are taken from the period immediately surrounding the production and release of the original film.   There is none of the revisionist hindsight pertaining to the film that has come about as a result of the films that came after; every word spoken by the people involved is \\"of the moment,\\" and as such, is refreshingly candid about what was going on while the film was in the throes of its conception and execution.    The hardcover volume is worth the extra cost, because of its additional supplemental material, not found in the softcover edition.  There are 45 pages of storyboard reproductions, as well as Lucas' first-ever references to the larger world beyond what was shown in the original film, in the form of interview excerpts taken in 1977, which involve Lucas describing character and environmental background information.  As author J.W. Rinzler explains in the opening to the section, \\"Many of these ideas...[have since been] modified to a greater or lesser degree.  They are presented here...[as] an idea of how he first began [the process of expanding the \\"Star Wars\\" universe].\\"  Given the amount of tweaking that the backstory has undergone in the decades following \\"Star Wars,\\" the inclusion of Lucas' first impressions of it in this volume are incredibly valuable to anyone who, like me, has wondered if the second trilogy of films was truly borne from his original ideas, or was more a product of his later experiences.    This book is exactly what its title promises: the definitive history behind the original film.  And for someone who has spent most of his life feeling like there was nothing new under the suns (not a typo) when it came to the story of how \\"Star Wars\\" was made, that's saying something.
B00005JPTA|5.0|This movie was one of the most powerful, captivating movies I have seen in many years.  Mortensen is amazing in his ability to be a chameleon, to transform into his role, and convince you that he is indeed a Russian mobster.  Totally enjoyed.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|first time I saw and heard Yanni was on the PBS broadcast of Live at the Acropolis, and I was hooked. My wife insisted I get the CD. It is still her favorite CD.     Lost touch for some years, and didn't know that Yanni's concert at the Taj Mahal was available.     Finally got the Concert Event on DVD and the whole magic of his music was back again. Pedro Eustache (Duduk, flutes.. is there anything this guy cannot do?) and Samvel Yervinyan (violin) are the super talented musicians who helped Yanni create probably his best music concert. I only wish I could have seen the actual concert.     On Amazon, I finally checked out and got Yanni's Tribute DVD. This is terrific.... I simply love Nightingale. Having all three of Yanni's DVDs, I think his Concert Event is the best.     I agree with another reviewer, however, that the Concert Event and other DVDs are most enjoyable on the DVD, but if you just want to LISTEN, then Yanni's CDs like Reflections of Passions, etc are the way to go. The DVDs have more showmanship and the individual musicians are a joy to watch when they play their magic. Love Yanni for bringing us this great music.

B000R4SMCW|4.0|I expected better reviews on fracture but I suppose not everyone will be able to give complete attention to Hopkins and overlook the films flaws. Yes Anthony Hopkins had yet another one man show where he gave us some comedy, a little creepiness, and amazing intelligence to defeat the law. Ted Crawford (Anthony Hokins) has found that his wife is cheating on him with a man who looks further down from Crawford's age and closer to her own. Crawford waits for his wife to come home and then proceeds to shoot her not killing her but she stays unconscious. Crawford moves some things in the house including the shell casings (replacing them with new ones) and waits for the police to come.<br /><br />When the police arrive Crawford confesses to his crime and then surrenders. At his arraignment Crawford retracts his confession and then says that he wants to represent himself. He then meets Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) who is the district attorney trying to put him away. Beachum has some trouble, he is a young attorney who has not lost a case and is receiving a new and well paid job at a new firm for it. He expected Crawfords case to be very easy but Crawford has so many tricks up his sleeve and Beachum might not get that job. The two go back and forth trying to outsmart one another but it will all come down to the wire and the end is pretty darn good.<br /><br />The story is a good one and with characters that could bore you being played by any other actor the cast was picked very well. As I said before Anthony Hokins kills this movie. His comedic sarcastic scenes are hilarious and I have never seen a movie where I wanted the bad guy to win so badly. Ryan Gosling was an ok opponent for Hopkins but maybe not perfect for this role. I seriously couldn't stand Goslings relationship with Rosamund Pike at all. In a lot of movies they feel the need to add a girlfriend or boyfriend to fill some movie time and it doesn't always work. What makes this film is Anthony Hopkins, he does a crazy job playing this guy and he makes every minute of the movie a little more interesting. I would say this would be a pretty good movie to rent or borrow. I think all together it's a 4 star film with 5 star acting from one actor so it's not enough to give it 5. It has a nice little twist at the end and it's definitely worth seeing.g this guy and he makes every minute of the movie a little more interesting.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|\\"Death Proof\\" is Quentin Tarantino's contribution to \\"Grindhouse\\", where it was double-billed with Robert Rodriguez' \\"Planet Terror\\" and sandwiched between fake move trailers that recreated the exploitation film experience of the 1970s. \\"Death Proof\\" offers gruesome murders, bang-up car chases, and sexy women for the moviegoer who doesn't like a lot of context with his entertainment. Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) is a teetotalling, scar-faced killer who stalks and slays his pretty young victims with his souped-up death-proof stunt car.<br /><br />Shot in natural tones and altered to look like a scratched, crackly print that has run through the projector too many times, cast with characters who smoke and drink carelessly and constantly, \\"Grindhouse\\" intermittently feels like nostalgia. But this is more than a homage to cruder days gone by. It sends up its own inspirations and shows us just why we like the unapologetic sex-violence dichotomy of B-movies. Cell phones and ATMs remind us that this is not a period film. The period is now; the style was then. The culture encompasses both, and indeed the entire modern era, which is why this is so fun to watch.<br /><br />The Weinstein Company 2007 2-disc DVD set does not include any of the fake trailers that were part of \\"Grindhouse\\"'s theatrical release. This version of \\"Death Proof\\" is 2 hours long, while the American theatrical double-bill version was only 90 minutes. The \\"missing reel\\" has been recovered, but 2 hours felt too long to me. 90 minutes cut short Tarantino's signature languishing on tawdry social scenes and catchy inane conversation. I guess there's no happy medium. But \\"Death Proof\\" is a surprisingly enjoyable tacky, violent romp that takes on a life of its own and engages the audience at some point.

B00005JPRD|3.0|When I saw the eye-popping clips of this 2007 movie in a preview earlier this year, it became readily apparent that director Julie Taymor has lost none of the visual invention that informs her vivid staging of [[ASIN:B000001M1B The Lion King]] and her Baroque-level approach to 1999's [[ASIN:B000E6ESKS Titus]]. What I feared most from what I saw was that it would be more like an extended fantasy-laden musical video with the classic Beatles songbook basically providing most of the dialogue. It turns out I am mostly right, though there is a somewhat trite and rather predictable narrative, provided by Taymor and co-screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, at the core of the movie. Building a story around thirty-three unrelated Beatles songs is no easy task, and the contrivances are gratefully not as exaggerated as one would expect. At the same time, the characters feel hastily developed to fit the contours of the diverse songs, and most of the resulting performances are not compelling enough to bring it all together in a cohesive manner.<br /><br />Set in the 1960's, the plot revolves around Jude, a working-class bloke from Liverpool going stateside to visit the father he's never met, and Lucy, a product of East Coast privilege who becomes increasingly radicalized after her high school sweetheart dies overseas as the Vietnam War keeps raging on. Jude and Lucy meet through her brother Max, a Princeton undergrad who drops out to live in bohemian style in Greenwich Village but then gets drafted into the military. No surprise that a romance between Jude and Lucy evolves amid the anti-war countercultural movement, including a bus trip through psychedelia. There are other characters in the mix with equally familiar names - Sadie, a raspy-voiced Janis Joplin doppelganger about to break big on the rock music scene; Jo-Jo, her lover and competitor who evokes Jimi Hendrix's looks and individualistic guitar style; and Prudence, a sexually confused Ohio cheerleader who literally comes in through the bathroom window.<br /><br />The love story is strictly by the numbers, but the musical performances can be infectious. Evan Rachel Wood continues to impress even in a role as self-contained as Lucy, and her plaintive rendition of \\"If I Fell\\" is surprisingly affecting. The rest are definitely more singers than actors. Jim Sturgess appears to have been cast for his vocal resemblance to Paul McCartney, not a bad reason though he does manage to capture Jude's plot-driven angst with convincing abandon. He gets the lion's share of the classic ballads - \\"Girl\\", \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\", \\"Something\\", \\"All My Loving\\", \\"All You Need Is Love\\". Joe Anderson delivers a party-hearty \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" with his Princeton frat brothers and later a somber \\"Hey Jude\\" as a postwar-traumatized Max. As budding lesbian Prudence, T.V. Carpio does a doleful version of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" crossing through acrobatic football players during practice. Dana Fuchs brings a soulful thrust to \\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\", and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", while Martin Luther McCoy poignantly covers \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".<br /><br />A few of the sequences don't work as well as others, for example, Jude's extended trashing of the protestors' office to the strains of \\"Revolution\\", the pin-cushioned strawberries transforming into bombs during the dual-perspective montage of \\"Strawberry Fields\\", and the drug-hazed antics of Bono as a Timothy Leary figure on \\"I Am the Walrus\\". Some of the more interesting performances come from the surprise guest appearances, such as Eddie Izzard as the ringmaster of a weirdly psychedelic \\"For the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\", Carol Woods and Timothy T. Mitchum delivering a powerful \\"Let It Be\\" set against the 1967 Detroit riots, and Joe Cocker showing his unmistakable vocal style under three different guises on a rollicking \\"Come Together\\". Even Salma Hayek shows up as a coterie of nurses in a roulette-style hospital during \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\". There is a very defined audience for this type of confection, and there are more definitive performances of these classic songs elsewhere. At the same time, Taymor has an audacious visual sense well worth experiencing. Proceed with caution.piness Is a Warm Gun\\".

1594489505|4.0|Having read The Kite Runner, I fully expected a similar story.  It is not.  This fascinating story takes place over thirty years in Afghanistan.  We witness the Soviet invasion to the Taliban to Post-Taliban rebuilding through the eyes of two beautiful human beings, Mariam and Laila.  It was hard to get past the brutality and violence commited against the women in the story.  If I have ever questioned to what degree of insanity I must be driven to to take another's life, this would be it.  The daily lives of Mariam and Laila are heartbreaking.  If you really want a day to day account of what it might be like to experience these thirty years of Afghanistan turmoil, this is a good book for that purpose.

0316166685|4.0|On August 14, 2002, I attended an Alice Sebold reading. As an ex-journalist, I'm a cynic. Until that day, I had only read about five novels since 1978. Most fiction involves less research and \\"rules\\" than non-fiction.<br /><br />Yet Sebold spent five years writing \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" She didn't intend it to be a Great American Novel (awful clich&eacute;), a handbook about managing grief. Then astoundingly, it sold more than one million copies in less than two months. Why?<br /><br />On May 8, 1981, Alice Sebold was raped, an incident that nearly destroyed her. She wrote an explicit, shocking and almost neglected book in 1999 called \\"Lucky.\\" It was this knowledge, as a non-fiction reader, and not hype or current events, that drew me to \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" You may not have to know this about Sebold. But if you do, what she writes in \\"The Lovely Bones\\" assumes credibility, even if you're shaking your head in bewilderment, having trouble believing what's in it.<br /><br />\\"Hype\\" is a fashionably pessimistic word being used with excess to leverage what in my view are elitist comments against this book. \\"Hype\\" is a product of marketing with little relevance to quality. I agree with whomever said the following: People who give into \\"hype\\" expecting a seismic shift in their lives before turning to \\"page one,\\" are doomed to disappointment. Hype doesn't give a book \\"legs.\\" Word-of-mouth does.<br /><br />Narrating from the dead, as Susie Salmon does in \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" isn't new. In the shorthand of cinema, you can quickly point to \\"Sunset Boulevard (1950) and \\"American Beauty (1999).\\" She may seem wiser beyond her \\"years,\\" but it isn't critical to separate adolescent vs. adult narration. \\"Real time\\" exists for the living. Susie's dead.<br /><br />In \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" the only thing that matters is what remains in memory. We question what we can't see, yet invisible things like oxygen, love, hate, lust, sorrow and hope are undeniable. After people die, we hear their voices, we remember their touch and the way they look. They're in the next room, watching TV, reading, whatever. Sebold captures our obsession, our \\"presence of mind\\" about the dead. This obviously resonates with people, many without the time to read 10 books per year. To denigrate fans of this book smacks of unnecessary snobbery that promotes literary \\"class distinctions.\\" Conversely, sophisticated readers raise valid criticisms that wouldn't be as intense if they read the \\"NC-17\\" horrors of \\"Lucky.\\"<br /><br />Sebold creates an atmosphere absent of shrillness or clinically described violence. A \\"quick read\\" is not synonymous with shallowness. Expressing the intangible with sentences 10-25 words in length is near impossible. But Sebold's ability to impart abstract thoughts into simple sentences can't be dismissed. This is not a murder mystery. If it was, it'd be ordinary. This is an admittedly broad-brush story about family connections that pushes the thriller into the back seat. Splitting hairs about the plausibility of character motivations misses the big picture of \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" It's not literature aspiring for greatness, filled with big words, tortuous sentences and the type of false profundities that wins awards. It's a book that achieves something greater for most writers -- a chance to weave a collection of universal themes -- through an accessible narrative that sophisticated readers as well as the greater body of people who have zero desire to read can appreciate.<br /><br />Perhaps this is why disappointed readers keep using words like \\"overrated\\" or phrases like, \\"doesn't live up to the hype.\\" They're comfortable with authors requiring more words leading toward a revelation that feels closer to irony and \\"truth\\" than uplift. Hence what's \\"familiar\\" seems trite.<br /><br />But Sebold isn't trite. We demand logical human behavior, but there's a randomness about everything that lies ahead. Wry observations bring the ordinary to the surface without, in mostcases, pretentiousness. Accusations of peddling cheap sentiment ring false because she draws upon her past to conjure up spare, abstract subtext and expressions to carry her tale. She succeeds using observational symbolism without wielding a preachy sledgehammer. Looking for religious dogma in heaven? Forget it. To Susie, \\"heaven\\" is just a shorthand for where she \\"is.\\" It could be anything.<br /><br />Sebold's idea is that the dead do more than just \\"think.\\" There are reasons why they suddenly seem near, then disappear. She told ABC News that she doesn't think too much about heaven. But she obviously thinks a lot about the dead, especially victims of violence. Some complain her characters are \\"caricatures.\\" Composites of traits we've seen in friends and ourselves makes a concept less believable? Susie's \\"voice,\\" regardless of age, represents her view, however subjectively precocious, illogical or formulaic. Only one chapter goes off the tracks, proffering a scene that comes too close to \\"Ghost.\\"<br /><br />Is this a book for the ages? Maybe not. But I'm disturbed that a \\"commercial\\" success, even unexpected (as some forget this was), can be disproportionately punished with contempt in forums, unworthy of being labeled a \\"literary success.\\" If the masses like it, hype is responsible and it must be suspect, despite glowing reviews from respected critics, many with advanced degrees in English and comparative literature.<br /><br />For me, a non-fiction reader, the restrained poignancy of Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a surprise in the aftermath of her uncensored and harrowing memoir, \\"Lucky.\\" In the hands of any writer bereft of real-life misfortune, concepts about death in a fictional tale, wouldn't have worked. It's impossible for me to ignore the author's history, despite her repeated statements that a huge gulf exists between \\"Lucky\\" and \\"The Lovely Bones.\\"<br /><br />Yet the success of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" proves it doesn't matter. Thirty years from now, people will still be talking about it.

0805079831|1.0|This book has huge flaws in it. She denounces the Chicago school of economics and Milton Friedman saying that Democracy and Chicago School economics are incompatible with democracy. What she favors is a Scandinavian model.<br /><br />But Sweden has adopted Milton Friedman's proposals of vouchers system and of public private competition in education 1992. Not the elimination of public education but public choice. Contrary to her thesis Sweden's privatization of public schools did happen democratically in and 15 years after the voucher system Sweden hasn't devolved into a authoritarian fascist state.<br /><br />It also disproves her theory that there is conflict between Scandinavian model versus Milton Friedman liberalism because Sweden has adopted many of the reforms pushed for by Milton Friedman.<br /><br />The economist magazine \\"Free to choose, and Learn\\" May 3rd 2007<br />So the private sector, by increasing the total number of places available, can ease the mad scramble for the best schools in the state sector (bureaucrats, by contrast, dislike paying for extra places in popular schools if there are vacancies in bad ones).<br /><br />The strongest evidence against this criticism comes from Sweden, where parents are freer than those in almost any other country to spend as they wish the money the government allocates to educating their children. Sweeping education reforms in 1992 not only relaxed enrolment rules in the state sector, allowing students to attend schools outside their own municipality, but also let them take their state funding to private schools, including religious ones and those operating for profit. The only real restrictions imposed on private schools were that they must run their admissions on a first-come-first-served basis and promise not to charge top-up fees (most American voucher schemes impose similar conditions).<br /><br />The result has been burgeoning variety and a breakneck expansion of the private sector. At the time of the reformsonly around 1% of Swedish students were educated privately; now 10% are, and growth in private schooling continues unabated.<br /><br />Anders Hultin of Kunskapsskolan, a chain of 26 Swedish schools founded by a venture capitalist in 1999 and now running at a profit, says its schools only rarely have to invoke the first-come-first-served rule--the chain has responded to demand by expanding so fast that parents keen to send their children to its schools usually get a place. So the private sector, by increasing the total number of places available, can ease the mad scramble for the best schools in the state sector (bureaucrats, by contrast, dislike paying for extra places in popular schools if there are vacancies in bad ones).<br /><br />If the people want government spending Keynesian economics and market economics can only be implemented through authoritarian regimes why was Ronald Reagan ever elected and reelected President? But you would never get idea by reading her book she describes the Chicago school as radicals far right ideas that are incompatible with democracy. But right or wrong Chicago School ideas of having the free market rule over government regulation and central planning are not radical they are US policy of the last 27 years.<br /><br />The 1980 election central issue was the role of government and government spending.<br /><br />Jimmy Carter's platform was a classic Keynesian during the recession he pushed for higher government spending the spend your way out of a recession philosophy. Price and wage controls focus on unemployment and not inflation. He was a classic Keynesian<br /><br />Ronald Reagan's platform was for less government spending fighting inflation privatizations and deregulation and market liberalism.<br />Reagan was a classical liberalism.<br /><br />In order for her thesis to hold Klein must prove that Ronald Reagan was not democratically elected and ruled by authoritarian means. She does neither and her thesis fails.<br /><br />What bothers me about the book is that she selects facts that only conform to her world view. She provides the account that Nixon opposed the Chicago School economics because he feared he would loose the election. Whether Nixon would have lost is anybody's guess and to theorize the outcome is a to make a counter-factual argument. This is precisely what Naomi Klein has done and her entire argument rests on. What we do know is that the last 4 Presidents Reagan GHW Bush Clinton GW Bush ran on a pro market deregulation and all of them won the election. All of these facts and that Sweden and a long list of democratically elected governments pushed through Chicago School reforms point the opposite conclusion.<br />Naomi Klein in her book only includes evidence that conforms to her world view and rejects the rest. Therefore she is either misinformed (which is not likely) or she is trying indoctrinate people regardless of the facts.<br /><br />I am not alone in this the Tom Redburn of the NY Times in the article \\"Its All Grand Capitalist Conspiracy\\" September 29 2007  described the book as \\"Ms. Klein's goal in writing \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" is not so much to persuade others to join her anti-globalization, anti-corporatist cause as it is to reinforce the dreams of those already convinced of its righteousness. \\"<br /><br />He goes on to say that the book is \\"her argument constantly overreaches, because her goal is not really to tame capitalism so much as to taunt it.<br /><br />While Ms. Klein occasionally nods to Scandinavian-style social democracy as an alternative to the \\"neo-liberal\\" American-style model she condemns, it turns out that nothing short of a socialist utopia -- an economy of worker collectives running environmentally benign enterprises with nationalized banks to direct investment -- will actually do.<br /><br />What she is most blind to is the necessary role of entrepreneurial capitalism in overcoming the inherent tendency of any established social system to lapse into stagnation, as all too many socialist countries -- and some nonsocialist ones, too -- have shown. Like it or not, without strong economic growth and its inevitable disruptions , there is little hope for creating the healthy middle classes necessary to sustain democracies, much less an improvement in the lot of the poor and dispossessed Ms. Klein seeks to represent. And yes, that means some people will become rich and powerful.\\"<br /><br />Another flaw in her argument is that she insinuates the shock doctrine is the brain child of one person Milton Friedman. Milton Friedman's was the brain child of Chicago School Economics. But the term shock therapy was coined by Jeffery Sachs of Harvard. Sachs was not a intellectual disciple of colleague Friedman.<br /><br />The other claim that Milton Friedman advocated the use of torture. Friedman never advocated the use of force to compel people to conform. In fact he argued against it. All Governments compel people to divulge their property through taxes. The larger the government more state intervention the more government must compel people through force or the threat of force.  Socialism cannot exist with out Government compelling people to divest their property. From the leftist perspective taking property from individual is theft but taking property from the individual in order for it to be given back to the collective is social justice.<br /><br />Capitalism in its best form and relies on voluntary exchanges. No one is compelling you to buy this book from Amazon.com both the buyer and the seller voluntarily agree to the terms the price and the shipping arrangement. That same fundamental right is not available in highly regulated economies or state owned socialist utopias because your compelled to follow the rules of the state.<br /><br />We should not be compelled as the poor are in the inner city to give our money to schools that are inefficient corrupt and mismanaged. Individuals should have the right to give their tax dollars to the school that represents their best interests. This is one of the core believes of the Chicago School is that you can spend your money more efficiently than the government can.<br /><br />In the book the words she uses to describe the Chicago School are extreme radical but the ideas of market economics free trade zones have a long a track record of being successful implemented around the world. In an ironic twist many of the Chicago School proposals are more popular in Europe than the are in the US.<br /><br />I find it odd that anti-globalization anti-large corporations critics use large corporate websites such as amazon.com and youtube google to disseminate their anti-corporate dogma.
0316001821|4.0|On August 14, 2002, I attended an Alice Sebold reading. As an ex-journalist, I'm a cynic. Until that day, I had only read about five novels since 1978. Most fiction involves less research and \\"rules\\" than non-fiction.<br /><br />Yet Sebold spent five years writing \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" She didn't intend it to be a Great American Novel (awful clich&eacute;), a handbook about managing grief. Then astoundingly, it sold more than one million copies in less than two months. Why?<br /><br />On May 8, 1981, Alice Sebold was raped, an incident that nearly destroyed her. She wrote an explicit, shocking and almost neglected book in 1999 called \\"Lucky.\\" It was this knowledge, as a non-fiction reader, and not hype or current events, that drew me to \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" You may not have to know this about Sebold. But if you do, what she writes in \\"The Lovely Bones\\" assumes credibility, even if you're shaking your head in bewilderment, having trouble believing what's in it.<br /><br />\\"Hype\\" is a fashionably pessimistic word being used with excess to leverage what in my view are elitist comments against this book. \\"Hype\\" is a product of marketing with little relevance to quality. I agree with whomever said the following: People who give into \\"hype\\" expecting a seismic shift in their lives before turning to \\"page one,\\" are doomed to disappointment. Hype doesn't give a book \\"legs.\\" Word-of-mouth does.<br /><br />Narrating from the dead, as Susie Salmon does in \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" isn't new. In the shorthand of cinema, you can quickly point to \\"Sunset Boulevard (1950) and \\"American Beauty (1999).\\" She may seem wiser beyond her \\"years,\\" but it isn't critical to separate adolescent vs. adult narration. \\"Real time\\" exists for the living. Susie's dead.<br /><br />In \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" the only thing that matters is what remains in memory. We question what we can't see, yet invisible things like oxygen, love, hate, lust, sorrow and hope are undeniable. After people die, we hear their voices, we remember their touch and the way they look. They're in the next room, watching TV, reading, whatever. Sebold captures our obsession, our \\"presence of mind\\" about the dead. This obviously resonates with people, many without the time to read 10 books per year. To denigrate fans of this book smacks of unnecessary snobbery that promotes literary \\"class distinctions.\\" Conversely, sophisticated readers raise valid criticisms that wouldn't be as intense if they read the \\"NC-17\\" horrors of \\"Lucky.\\"<br /><br />Sebold creates an atmosphere absent of shrillness or clinically described violence. A \\"quick read\\" is not synonymous with shallowness. Expressing the intangible with sentences 10-25 words in length is near impossible. But Sebold's ability to impart abstract thoughts into simple sentences can't be dismissed. This is not a murder mystery. If it was, it'd be ordinary. This is an admittedly broad-brush story about family connections that pushes the thriller into the back seat. Splitting hairs about the plausibility of character motivations misses the big picture of \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" It's not literature aspiring for greatness, filled with big words, tortuous sentences and the type of false profundities that wins awards. It's a book that achieves something greater for most writers -- a chance to weave a collection of universal themes -- through an accessible narrative that sophisticated readers as well as the greater body of people who have zero desire to read can appreciate.<br /><br />Perhaps this is why disappointed readers keep using words like \\"overrated\\" or phrases like, \\"doesn't live up to the hype.\\" They're comfortable with authors requiring more words leading toward a revelation that feels closer to irony and \\"truth\\" than uplift. Hence what's \\"familiar\\" seems trite.<br /><br />But Sebold isn't trite. We demand logical human behavior, but there's a randomness about everything that lies ahead. Wry observations bring the ordinary to the surface without, in mostcases, pretentiousness. Accusations of peddling cheap sentiment ring false because she draws upon her past to conjure up spare, abstract subtext and expressions to carry her tale. She succeeds using observational symbolism without wielding a preachy sledgehammer. Looking for religious dogma in heaven? Forget it. To Susie, \\"heaven\\" is just a shorthand for where she \\"is.\\" It could be anything.<br /><br />Sebold's idea is that the dead do more than just \\"think.\\" There are reasons why they suddenly seem near, then disappear. She told ABC News that she doesn't think too much about heaven. But she obviously thinks a lot about the dead, especially victims of violence. Some complain her characters are \\"caricatures.\\" Composites of traits we've seen in friends and ourselves makes a concept less believable? Susie's \\"voice,\\" regardless of age, represents her view, however subjectively precocious, illogical or formulaic. Only one chapter goes off the tracks, proffering a scene that comes too close to \\"Ghost.\\"<br /><br />Is this a book for the ages? Maybe not. But I'm disturbed that a \\"commercial\\" success, even unexpected (as some forget this was), can be disproportionately punished with contempt in forums, unworthy of being labeled a \\"literary success.\\" If the masses like it, hype is responsible and it must be suspect, despite glowing reviews from respected critics, many with advanced degrees in English and comparative literature.<br /><br />For me, a non-fiction reader, the restrained poignancy of Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a surprise in the aftermath of her uncensored and harrowing memoir, \\"Lucky.\\" In the hands of any writer bereft of real-life misfortune, concepts about death in a fictional tale, wouldn't have worked. It's impossible for me to ignore the author's history, despite her repeated statements that a huge gulf exists between \\"Lucky\\" and \\"The Lovely Bones.\\"<br /><br />Yet the success of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" proves it doesn't matter. Thirty years from now, people will still be talking about it. I'm convinced no matter how hard Sebold tries -- the legacy created by her non-fiction \\"Lucky\\" and her fictional \\"The Lovely Bones\\" -- will remain preserved AND inextricably linked.

1594489505|4.0|I had liked Kate Runner, Hosseini's previous novel, but was not blown away like so many other readers. Still, I enjoyed it enough to want to read A Thousand Splendid Suns. I liked A Thousand Splendid Suns but didn't love this either. I really enjoyed seeing this novel play itself out in the midst of the constantly changing political and social landscape of Afganistan in the modern era. The story was intersting, and I was drawn in to the lives of the main characters. The middle of the story dragged a bit, and the characters felt too much like fictional characters (a criticism I had of Kate Runners). Finally, I wasn't really transported to Afganistan. The setting seemed a bit fictional, lacking the gritty realism of a great novel. That said, there were parts of this novel that I couldn't put down, and I looked forward to reading it throughout the book. There was too much of a predictable, crowd-pleasing Hollywood-ness to this book. Yet I enjoy a good Hollywood crowd-pleasing movie and I enjoyed this book.
0440178002|5.0|This is the novel that introduced the Samurai's bushido, daimyos rivalries and the bakufu Shogunate to the average westerner. Through the eyes of a shipwrecked navigator, Blackthorn, a previously hermetically closed world is revealed.<br /><br />From battle ethics and sepuku to hygiene and tea ceremonies, the interwoven narrative lines flow harmonically, like carps in a Zen rock garden pool. Beautiful, economical and seamless, Clavell's insights on human nature have produced another Masterpiece.<br /><br />Like most of James Clavell's novels, SHOGUN is a thinly veiled historical story. There was a &quot;Blackthorn&quot; (English pilot William Adams), as well as a &quot;Torenaga&quot; (Shogun Tokugawa whose dynasty ruled Japan for over 200 years). However, like most James Clavell's novels, the story comes alive in some many ways it is pure enjoyment!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />PS:<br />There is a 1980 TV mini series based on this book - of comparable merit. Casting Toshiro Mifune and Richard Chamberlain was just the tip of the iceberg. Truly beautiful production.<br />Nevertheless, my advice is to first read the book and only THEN watch the TV version.
630463949X|5.0|I've already watched many clips of these live songs on YouTube, but I decided I wanted better sound and video quality. This DVD is phenomenal. The show was very well executed and the vocal performances were stellar. Although it's true that Stevie can't reach the highs she could 20 years before, she's reinterpreted her songs, and I like some of these new versions better than the old versions (\\"Dreams\\" for instance I like better, and \\"Rhiannon\\" is amazing). Lindsey still sounds great, and I think the most emotional performance is on \\"Big Love\\", but he puts his whole self into every song. I've always loved Christine McVie's voice: she's a very important component of FM that many people often miss. Lindsey and Stevie get all the exposure, but Christine is just as important, her smooth and unique voice balancing out Stevie's rough voice. Overall, one of my favorite live concert albums, and a great value. In regards to their performance in Boston, I think it's a bit weaker, but it does offer a more real concert setting than this dvd, since it was set in a studio: so it may be worth a buy for a different environment.

B0001I562I|5.0|20 years later and I still stop and watch it when it's on TV. this movie is about a boy, Joey Cramer (played the son of Tom Sellick in Runaway) falls in a forest near home and gets knocked out. He wakes up only to find himself in the future. Also an alien spaceship needs to complete a brain scan of David (Cramer) to get his star charts and go home. The trouble is: NASA. David finds out something weird. His little brother Jeff is no longer littler and no longer younger than David. NASA wants to know where he was and what's the connection between him and the spaceship they have locked up in a hanger? As David is kept in NASA, many questions that are running thru his mind need to be answered. David and the Alien spaceship take him back home while NASA is hot on their trail. Is David going to be Jeff's little brother from now on? Will the Alien spaceship piloted by Pee-Wee Herman be able to return and complete its mission?<br /> Warm, family-friendly movie. I especially like the part that the alien ship stops at a gas stattion in Florida and the gas attendant is shocked to see an alien ship ringing the bell for gas. David asks for change to make a phonecall. When a family stops at the gas station as David and the alien spaceship leave, the father from the family asks,\\" What's going on?\\" The gas station attendant replies,\\" He just wanted to call home\\". This movie stars, Cliff DeYoung, Howard Hessman (Head of the Class), Sarah Jessica Parker and Paul Reubans aka Pee-Wee Herman as Max the voice in the alien ship. No extras in the flick but I don't care much for extras, except for deleted scenes and funny outakes (this movie has neither).

The casting director picked the actors who embody the characters.  It is exquisitely filmed and I wish I could take a trip to some of the areas that are displayed in this movie. It is not as thorough as the version which stars Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, the actors in this film Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightley can not be outshown by any other pairing on film.  They are Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.

B000F8O35U|5.0|I have found that this film has become one of our favorites, and for good reason. It has true  love (ah, true love: the best kind!), determination, drama, humor, delightfully amusing scenes (Ariel the Mermaid flirtily combing her hair with a fork at the dining table in the castle, because Scuttles the Seagull [whose voice is superbly played by Buddy Hackett] told her a fork was a \\"dinglehoffer ... which humans use to straighten their hair with!\\"), an incredible Oscar wnning score, and a HAPPY ending. The original tale, by Hans Christian Anderson, did not end so happily...Disney was wise to change this. In so doing he made this film \\"The Little Mermaid\\" beloved by families all over the world.  We may watch it a bit more than most families (we have children with autism --when they have favorites they like to watch them a LOT!!!) but I don't mind a bit. This is top notch cartoon filmmaking and I love this movie as much as my children do! Sebastian the Crab, for example, is charming! The plot is totally great! The extra additions, such as Ashey Tisdale singing a hip version of \\"Kiss the Girl\\" are really fun to watch and listen to. This Platinum Edition, very well done, is a GREAT addition to your film collection whether you choose it because it is a cartoon or just because you want a good old plain superterrific movie!<br />Have some underwater fun and get it today!
031286504X|2.0|I bought this book after learning it was being made into a movie later this year. It wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Actually, I found boring and very nearly as exciting a read as others found it.<br /><br />The main character spends most of the time in the book drunk, breaking glasses and consumed by self pity in a virus-vampire filled world. The only dangers he encounters are from situations he himself creates. The \\"vampires\\" are more like the retarded zombies from night of the living dead than the smart and fast creatures from other novels. They just sorta stumble outside his home-fortress and hope he comes out so they can get him. Very uninteresting stuff. With a lack of any other supporting character, and the main character being so unlikeable and unrealistic, I found the story falls flat. It also ends suddenly, just when something interesting looks like it's starting. \\"I am legend\\" is only half the book, the other half are a collection of short stories.<br /><br />Hopefully \\"Hell House\\" is a little better. I can't recommend this book, it may have been scary when written but now it's outdated and a bore.

This version of the diary has more material than the orginal, which some people think is too much, but it is what she wrote left alone. It has what she intended the book to be. It includes story from the restrictions put on her while she wasn't in hiding because she was Jewish to her chores that she did quietly in the Secret Annex such as peeling potatoes and rubbing beans. It is not always the most interesting book, but it does provoke thought. It's sad in the fact that you know how its going to end before you start, but Anne does not as she's wrting it.

Selleck and director Robert Harmon have created an engaging story and a tough but fair, endearing character. A blue collar detective in the spirit of David Jensen's Harry O, and James Gardner's Rockford Files, but the Jesse Stone character is a real world cop, with real personal demons, especially aging while remaining vital in law enforcement, as well as finding peace of mind in the solitude of Paradise.MA. This is Tom Selleck's finest work. Robert Parker has created a character with the appeal of James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux, another fictional detective in a battle with the bottle and the system.

The character McLintock is an older rancher who has a charitable attitude.  He is friends with Indian chiefs, even though they tried to kill each other earlier in their lives.  He warns homesteaders that land is not suitable for farming, and hires one young man who needs to support his mother and sister.  He has a problem with his wife for reasons not given, and a daughter who just returned from college back east.  The story holds your interest as he deals with Indians, homesteaders, his wife, and his daughter.  He is an environmentalist of sorts who plans to leave most of his ranch to the government to use as a park.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Truly a remarkable piece of film making. Have bought a few for family as well. A truly worth while piece of film making that is worth keeping in your collection. I must say you probably will get a slightly better deal on ebay!!! sry amazon.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie follows the story of Oskar Schindler during WWII.  He starts off acting about as shallow and greedy as a man can be.  He uses Jewish labor in his factory because it's cheap and that's the beginning and end of his concern.  But this slowly changes through a combination of familiarity with his Jewish workers and the increasingly brutal treatment of Jews by the Nazi regime.  Schindler found something that seems to have been a true rarity in the Nazi empire, compassion for Jews and the conviction to do something about it.  For the sake of those who may not have seen the film, I will say no more about the plot.    Schindler's List is not a \\"fun\\" movie to watch.  It's compelling, outstanding, powerful, and more... but not fun.  The film shows in fairly graphic detail (though it could have been worse) how Jews were systematically stripped of their homes, their possessions, and, finally, their lives.  The story is well told and carries an emotional impact that very few movies could ever aspire to.  The acting is top drawer all the way.  Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are almost always singled out, and their performances certainly merit praise.  But Ben Kingsley's quiet strength is essential to setting the tone for the Jewish people in the movie and the huge cast of no-names all do yeoman's work in establishing a believable recreation of what is almost certainly the most horrific event in human history.    Steven Spielberg is a great director who has made some of the most successful movies in the history of the medium.  But none of his blockbusters deserve a higher place in history than Schindler's List.  It's difficult to watch in some respects due to the emotional impact but it's more than worth it.  If you've never seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to watch it at least once.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Not big on sci-fi, but I can say this is up there with the original Star Wars trilogy.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This is the member's daughter. In our general music class at school, we studied this. I must say i enjoyed it, and passed the test with flying colors.I found it really cool that The Wizard of Oz ties in with this.  My personal opinion is, if you're a pop fan, with a little splash of showtunes, you'll like the soundtrack. Although some of the songs are very dark ( \\" No one Mourns The Wicked\\" , \\" No Good Deed\\" (Which she stars off shouting \\"Fiyero!\\"... How pleasant.), \\"March Of The Witch Hunters\\"), there's some songs you just can't help but bop your head to ( \\"Dancing Through Life\\", \\"Popular\\", \\"The Wizard and I\\"), but there's also some songs that don't really fit into any catagory, except show tunes (\\" Dear Old Shiz\\", \\"What Is This Feeling?\\"). Some of the songs are just \\"Blah\\".... and not that chatchy. ( \\"Something Bad\\", \\"One Short Day\\", \\"Thank Goodness\\", \\"a Sentimental Man\\") My favorites are definatly \\"Not That Girl\\", \\"As Long As Your Mine\\", and \\"Defiying Gravity\\".      As in the words of Elphaba.....    \\"It's just... for the first time... i feel.. wicked.\\"
0316018953|4.0|Having read all of Connelly's work, I have to say that this story here was a welcome addition to his seminal Bosch series. 'The Overlook' does not fit the formula of the earlier Bosch stories. Instead it felt like a light version of the TV series 24. Instead of Jack Bauer we have Harry Bosch. Much of what makes 24 riveting is used here to good effect.<br /><br />The story itself starts off with Bosch being called to a murder scene at on overlook along Mulholland Drive. It quickly becomes apparent that terrorists are involved and that the motives behind the murder are based on radioactive materials that could be used in the creation of a dirty bomb. The rest of this story involves Bosch battling the FBI and others for clues in order to solve the murder.<br /><br />The ending of this book is unexpected and in my opinion is rather clever. I did not see it coming. I would say that Connelly does not always manage to write the perfect story, but this one comes fairly close. If you enjoy this series, you will enjoy this book.
B0000640VO|5.0|Probably one of the best films of the last century. If you havent seen this yet...please do. Cheers!!!!
B0000067X1|4.0|This album is one of those few of which I can say, every time I hear it, I get something different. The songs are melodic and ethereal, laden with guitars and keyboards that swoop and warble but never become incoherent.     At first I didn't know what to make of all this. So many groups claim inspiration from this band, that I expected a format chained to the leaden beats of today. Surprise! Can's music was sweet and perky and inventive.    This was the first album of theirs I ever bought. Like a cleverly designed house, it's one of those things that is bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside.
0380820498|4.0|\\"Wednesday's Child\\" is another outstanding offering from the talented Peter Robinson.  Each of his books are carefully constructed police procedurals and Robinson consistently exhibits an ability to build sensitivity, tension and character into each of his novels. This one features Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks, the star of most of his novels, but it also gives added dimension to another favorite Robinson character, Detective Superintendent Gristhorpe.  The two of them, with their loyal, able Yorkshire police comrades, methodically track down the kidnapper of a little girl.  As in all the other Robinson novels, the bad guy is usually not who you think it is.  And by the ending, you know that you have read a book written by a literary craftsman.  I look forward to reading many more Peter Robinson books.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Its 300 in all its glory on the best format available.  On a 42\\" 1080p Aquos it doesn't get any better.  Amazon is awesome too.  First copy I ordered went to the wrong house (thanks UPS!).  Amazon gladly shipped me another one next day and refunded me all shipping costs.  This is why amazon will always be the first place I shop.
B000VDDDY6|1.0|Incarnations of Star Trek previously:    VHS - one episodes per cassette  Laserdisc - two episodes per disc  VHS - \\"remastered\\" one episode per cassette  DVD - two episodes per disc  DVD - red, yellow, blue boxed sets  HD-DVD - season 1, 2, 3 boxed sets    In my previous review of the red, yellow, blue boxed sets I warned everyone not to repurchase this version of Star Trek.  I predicted Paramount was going to re-re-re-release everything again for it's 40th anniversary. (1967-2007)...Well, it looks like I was right and they are bringing it just under the wire, before the 40th birthdate is over (to be released November 2007).  To those who bought the red-blue-yellow boxed DVD sets who also called those those fans who bought the two episodes per disc original DVD release as being \\"stupid\\", well, if you thought that you had the final release, you are now officially a \\"victim\\" yourself and will have to eat your own words -- that's IF you want the \\"enhanced\\" Star Trek.    For myself, I am one of the original two disc per DVD collector and am perfectly happy with it.  Frankly I don't like the visual enhancement and the re-recorded music.  I have seen a half-dozen episodes of the enhanced version and to be honest the \\"look\\" is \\"off\\".  I like the original physical models that were used...to me the digital models look, well...digital.  Like a video game.  I also find the music to sound off.  It is virtually impossible to re-perform the music exactly.  These differences are enough for the whole viewing experience to be distracting.  If you have the previous incarnations...I think they are just fine.  Save your money.  Besides the whole EXPENSIVE release is on HD-DVD and not Blu-Ray...and the format war is not over yet.  You could be buying a product that could possibly sit next to the bin full of Beta versions of Star Trek at the next garage sale.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Its one of my fav films of the last few years. I hardly buy movies for the keeps but this was an exception. A truly wonderful story shot beautifully and with a really eclectic sound track. Something worth going back to watch.
0802130208|5.0|This is probably one of my all-time favorite books for reasons that are far too many.  It is EXTREMELY well crafted and possesses an amazing sense of humor and satire; making it a classic.  I was amazed to find a book with such brilliant humor and at the same time a very deep philosophy.  A Confederacy of Dunces is more than just a laugh; but of course the true meaning of the book is only visible to those who seek--as with any masterpiece.  The only downside is that this is the only work that John Kennedy Toole has left behind.
0767802519|5.0|Mathilda is a bright 12 year old girl living with her awful family in a rundown tenement. She is emotionally ignored and physically beaten by her dope slinger father, her stepmother who dresses like a prostitute and her sister who seems to spend her life tightening her buttocks muscles to aerobices videos.  Mathilda's neighbor Leon is a quiet, brooding loner who performs mob hits through local mob contact Danny Aiello, who takes advantage of Leon's lack of education and language skills. Leon radiates disillusionment with his trade, but seems locked into what he does and does well.  Leon strikes a fatherly friendship with Mathilda; he taking pity on the sweet child and her unfortunate enviroment; she sadly desperate for stability and caring in her cruel world.  When renegade DEA man Gary Oldman and his combo posse of rogue agents and street thugs slaughter Mathildas family, Leon and Mathilda are forced together. Oldman soon comes to realize a witness from the apartment masscre may be alive.Little Mathilda becomes Oldmans target and detatched Leon's lonely life is invigorated as he uses his talent with firearms with his newfound role of paternal protecter of his charge.  Oldmans performance as a pill-popping dirty dealing cop is over the edge and the double life he leads somewhat incredible as he eases between dope ripoff and legit cop work without fear of detection. Jean Reno is superb in the silence and solitude of a borderline depressed thug who is probably raked with internal conflict over his line of work. Natalie Portman is Oscar material as a child who tries to be tough but in the end can only do what a child can do. Portmans portrayal is remarkably touching without being cloying or pandering and will probably warm the hearts of many who rent this for the gunplay.  GREAT FILM!!
B0000033TE|5.0|Admittedly, I have been away awhile. And how does a poor reflective Seer ever hope to make a dent in the astute \\"elite\\" top reviewers on Amazon is anybody's guess. Especially when he doesn't write. But, ok, I can be distracted by life sometimes. And, let's be real, everyone wants a part of my attention these days. Fame does have it's drawbacks. Imparting true wisdom is an awesome calling (and time consuming). That is why I took a break to be in a clown troupe for a traveling circus after listening to Brain Salad Surgery. I needed time to repair my delicate brain synapases after this incredible cranium assault. But, it is definitely worth the risk of listening.<br />Emerson, Lake and Palmer pushed to the very limit of progressive rock with Brain Salad Surgery. This is nothing short of a glorious, grandiose,mega-inventive spiraling surge of aural over-indulgence that still stands today as a harkening towards the coming computer age.<br />What is still amazing to me are the various motifs that are displayed throughout the album. There is the struggle of various energy moving back and forth, trying to take hold of some supremacy. It is not only revealed in the manic, ever shifting time and meter. But also the literal quest for God in the shifting sands of time.<br />We begin with \\"Jerusalem\\", an angelic call to arms for a utopia to the final battle in \\"Karn Evil 9: 3rd Impression\\" whereby the utopia so valiantly fought for becomes blurred by the true identity of mankind. The creation becomes master of the creator. But even in that- it continues to be a battle for ages to come.<br />By any stretch of the imagination, this effort took 3 extremely talented artists to pull it off. The modes and scenescapes they create are indeed astounding. You go from the golden trumpets of \\"Jerusalem\\" to the war cry of \\"Tocatta\\" with blistering passages of war drums, insistent marching of moog, and a variety of sounds like a roman army marching towards victory. And then a swirling outerworldly cascade of sound from computerized technology. These intricate sounds interweave history itself. And the effect is nothing less than pure awe.<br />We get to the delicate \\"Still.....You Turn Me On\\" with moog wah-wah and the distinct flavor of being on the French left bank. I am searching for my beret as I write this! \\"Benny the Bouncer\\" is a sordid tale of a bar room brawl told in an English dancehall manner. Quick and clever-even down to the breaking bottles. Even if Benny lost, he is still of some use at Heaven's Gate.<br />We then get to the considerable epic of this album. \\"Karn Evil 9: 1st Impression (Pt. 1 and 2), 2nd Impression and 3rd Impression\\" are the creme de la creme of composition, creativity and sheer force that make it so unique in progressive rock. We are catapulted forward into a vast array of quick, sharp, shifting musical forays that one is almost unable to contain themself with such an aural assault. Greg Lake becomes the barker at the Karn Evil (carnivale) and beckons us in to see not only the remnants of a bygone age (\\"a real blade of grass\\") but that now nothing is really sacred anymore (\\"pull Jesus from a hat-get into that-get into that\\"). More than anything else- these compositions are really the instrument that will perform the surgery. After all, everyone's brain needs a little adjustment now and then. Who better than E,L and P to do it?<br />There is so much more to say that makes this album exemplary in so many ways. But, after you listen to this, you will never be the same. Take my word. In essence - there are albums out there so noteworthy and leave a lasting \\"impression\\" on you after the first hearing. This is one of those. Not only is this so well done-but they foretold the modern computerized world decades before it happened. Give a listen. See if you agree.<br />Now- time to throw away this clown outfit!<br />Airbrushing my way to social acceptance----Metamorphoof sound from computerized technology.

B000UJ24SC|5.0|This is metal! This inspires me and makes me happy to love this genre of music since I was 13! I picked up Miasma last year and thought it was good but it didn't blow me away. I picked up this disc having heard little bits of some songs and was pretty stoked on it. The only silence you will get from this album is the 5 seconds or so before the first song rips in. After \\"Everything went black\\" I had a smirk on my face.. the kind that only a good album can give you. I swear to god if you don't have an out of body experience listening to \\"What a horrible night to have a curse\\" you are dead inside! To make this short \\"Nocturnal\\" is nothing short of unrelenting metal that derserves to be praised as it's been a long time in my opinion that something has moved me as much as this has. A great album!
B000UFAURI|4.0|Excellent album, most of the songs are well written, and the Foos have not lost their magic.  However, my complaint is that this album has too many acoustic-songs. There are a couple of songs that start out acoustic and rocks out at the end...but I think Dave and Co. trade in their electric guitars for acoustic ones on the second half of the album..which is not a bad thing, but I feel for only 12 songs on the album, there is too much acoustic.  Now if there were 14 songs on the album with just as many acoustic songs, with 2 more heavy songs than there is now, the album would be perfect.  But 7 or 8 out of the 12 songs are pretty chill with some exceptions...The Pretender is the heaviest song on the album, takes you back to the \\"One by One\\" days.    This album, however, DID flow much better than their double disc album In Your Honor.      This album is 4 stars because I would have liked to have seen some more heavy rockers on it...otherwise, a great album!
B000A0GP18|1.0|Why mess with perfection? Would \\"The Good,the Bad and the Ugly\\" be better if the film was updated with some more current talent?  \\"The Longest Yard\\" from the 70's is a first rate football/prison flick about disgraced QB Paul Crewes trying protect himself and then do right after landing in prison for a few years.  The remake is a pointless update, and if seen in context of the original, it is in excercise in nothing but capitalist exploitation  and the \\"repackage-all-that-sells\\" attitude of Hollywood. Adam Sandler is capable of good comedy, but does not have the football background Burt Reynolds had to make credible. Chris Rock and Nelly are tiresome and a predictable reach to crossover to the BET and Hip-Hop crowd. The first try wasn't without humor, but also showed a very serious side to life in stir. The remake is all laughs and \\"don't drop the soap\\" jokes.  The first \\"Longest Yard\\" was a film, this \\"Longest Yard\\" is a PRODUCT.
B00074DXJE|5.0|I was really surprised by this movie. I waited to see it until part 3 came out. I just had it in my head that it would be stupid, so I never gave it a chance. I'm so glad I listened to my husband! I watched all three movies in one night and I was hooked! The plot is really difficult to explain without giving anything away, so I won't. I'll just tell you if you're into thrillers, horror, or mysteries, watch SAW!
0060853980|2.0|I'm not too familiar with Terry Pratchett, but I've read and enjoyed almost everything Neil Gaiman's written, which is why I decided to give this a shot. It started out promisingly enough--I laughed out loud 2-3 times, and the main characters, the angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley, are interesting and well-written. The problem is after the first 200 pages or so, when the story seems to run out of steam. Most of the jokes feel \\"forced\\", and they concentrate too much on the Antichrist and his friends, which would be okay had those characters been more interesting. The Antichrist is supposed to be 11 years old at that point, but judging by the way he and his friends talk and act, I'd put them more at 6-7 tops. This was really annoying to me, and really ruined the mood. Also, the tone of the last 75 pages or so really becomes too preachy and feel-good for my tastes. I only finished it because it was so short. Overall, if you're a die-hard Gaiman (or Pratchett) fan, I'd recommend it just to round out your collection, but I can't say I'd recommend it for those who are unfamiliar with their work.
B0007Q6QVO|5.0|Melanie C's best CD...every single song is wonderful...I'm in the USA, and I ordered it all the way from England, and I WAS NOT disappointed...worth every penny
B000O178BY|4.0|This started in as one man band from what I understand, and has made some progess for the good of music!
B000LC3IDI|5.0|I really liked this movie. I loved Saw, but I was a little disapointed with Saw 2. Saw 3 more than makes up for it! The tests and death scenes are gruesome, and the characters are more likeable and realistic. There are many twists and turns, and I can't wait to see Saw 4! It'll have to be pretty good to keep up to this movie.
6304711891|5.0|Academy Award winners Sean Connery (Best Supporting Actor, \\"The Untouchables\\"-1987) & Nicholas Cage (\\"Best Actor, \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\"-1995) team up with Academy Award nominee Ed Harris (\\"Apollo 13\\"), Michael Biehn (\\"The Terminator,\\" \\"The Abyss,\\" Navy SEALS\\") & the powerhouse duo of producers Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer (\\"Top Gun,\\"<br />\\"Crimson Tide\\") and director Michael Bay (\\"Bad Boys\\") for this action-packed adventure thriller about the reopening of Alcatraz by a grieved Vietnam & Desert Storm General (Ed Harris, in a knockout performance) and the men (Sean Connery & Nicholas Cage, once again delivering their usual excellent performances) with the skills to take him down. Biehn, as usual, is excellent. With their recent films \\"Con Air,\\" \\"Armageddon\\" & the epic World War II romance \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" Bruckheimer (Don Simpson died of a drug overdose while this film was still in production) and Bay have simply mastered the art of filmmaking. Bruckheimer is excellent working solo (\\"Remember The Titans,\\" \\"Glory Road\\" & the action-packed<br />\\"Pirates Of The Caribbean\\" films-all for Walt Disney Pictures). This film is rated PG-13 for strong violence and language.
B000C20VPA|5.0|With this all-star cast, it will keep you entertained from beginning to end.  A wonderful movie.
B0000029GA|4.0|good album you can hear the early 90's rap on it. (i hope ppl understand me when i say that) overall it was a good album he keeps getting better with time and i recommend it. i recommend all of them
6305499365|5.0|I love this movie! I worked at a video store during college, and I reccomended this to all kinds of people. It was one of the few movies that everyone could find something to laugh at while watching it. Peter is an average Joe who hates almost everything about his average office job. When his hyptomism goes wrong, he stops caring, and surprisingly does better at work. When his two friends are laid off the three hatch a plan to get some money out of the company, but nothing works out as planned.
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you liked the movie, or if you like ACTUAL old time folk music, then, like me, you'll truly enjoy this CD.  The recordings are clear, there's a nice booklet that talks about the process and background of the movie and music, as well as the whole plot!  Molto interresante!  I play it over and over.
B000VNMMRA|4.0|When I first saw this flick, I knew it would be coming out unrated because I knew some fans werent happy with the writing and probably shyed away from this film. The PG-13 version was a pretty good action flick, one of the best of the summer. This is the age of the \\"unrated\\" dvds. Unrated dvds never really live up to the hype all it is usually contains nudity, a little more violence, and alot more swearing. Watching the unrated film felt like watching a kung fu movie. Watch carefully when Bruce drops an F bomb. His face is always covered, the camera is looking away, or his lips dont match the line. While some people might like the unrated version, it was laughable. Its like they knew some fans hated the PG-13 version so they went into the studio and overdubbed a few f-bombs for the unrated edition. All in all, its still a excellent action movie-rated or unrated.
B000002B1M|4.0|now im a fan of NaS and i love him (ask my boyfriend) this is one of my favorite albums by him. his lastest has to be my all time favorite i could listen to that album front to back. he's a true emcee. he has pure talent. i've been a fan for years and i think he fell of with nastradamus but everyone has at least one album that aint their best
0345438205|1.0|Basically, it is a commentary on the society present in 3001 as compared to the 20th and 21st century. Many interesting concepts are explored, including the nature of Solar System space activities.    However, if you enjoyed 2001 and 2010, I would recommend to skip this book. Simply because it will detract from the splendour of the black monolith.    As some reviewer previously pointed out, it seems that Arthur C Clarke wrote this to purposely de-mystify all the rampant speculation of 2001. As though he got sick of all the various postulations of everyone and everybody continuously bugging him about the mystery of the Black Monolith.     The secret of the Monolith is revealed in the most pedestrian way and removes all sense of wonder from the series. Additionally, while relevant, some of the 3001 descriptions of technology seem a little, well, obvious, given we are now closer to 2008, and Braincap = Matrix etc.     Finally, it is very surprising (and frustrating also as relates to how the Monolith communicates with its Source) that light speed is still a major impedance to communications, while seemingly free propulsion is available and terraforming, colonies, robot and bioengineering is all in full swing, there is no real mention, in 3001, for goodness' sake, (for Deus' sake) of missions to nearby stars, say anything within 20 light years which should have had human exploration marked on it by this time.    A perfect recap of the ending of my geeky (well, seriously-geeky) sci-fi phase of my life.    Go watch Sunshine (Fox Searchlight, 2007) for some good \\"harder\\" sci-fi.
B000683VI4|5.0|this is my favorite movie. it is so touching and i must say it gives hope for all those cynical people who think true love doesn't exist. I recommend this movie to everybody I know and everyone loves it. I've watched it more than 20 times and I always cry.

B00008DDXL|5.0|Excellent movie. Viewers should read the book first to fully understand the contents of the movie.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Too often 'big names' fizzle in the hype - but not so \\"Legends of the Fall,\\" in which Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, and Aidan Quinn combine to tell the story of a family in Montana being dragged into the modern (1916)world.<br /><br />In shades of Beau Geste, as one brother goes off to war, the others follow, to the dismay of patriarch Anthony Hopkins. The resulting story is one of courage under fire - both at war and afterwards - and reaction to adversity. Add in a music score that you'll replay in your head for hours, as well as some stunning scenery, and this is a movie that begs for being seen on those cold winter Sunday afternoons.
B000002GBK|1.0|I kept looking for a story line to match the music much like Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds.
B00005221M|5.0|This film adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's book brings the French & Inidan Wars to the light of day. Daniel Day Lewis is the Englishman raised by Indians who sides with the English in their bloody war against the French for control of what is now New York State - Vermont area.<br /><br />In the process, he meets and rescues the lovely Madeline Stowe, and their resulting relationship, along with a talented supporting cast, makes this story of love, courage, romance, and sacrifice one of the best of the year - with some of the most haunting music this side of The Chieftans. Worth seeing and re-seeing !!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I ordered this as a gift for my husband's birthday, but we couldn't wait the 2 months to view it.  It is awesome, and we certainly have watched in awe instead of watching the junk on regular TV.  Get it, give it, love our earth.

You have to put on a CD or the local alternative station when driving, or you 'll find yourself replaying \\"If you belonged to me\\" in your mind.  Uh-oh, it's happening again.  It is a shame Orbison passed away before they recorded this, his soaring voice really was one of many highlights of the Vol 1 record.  I've always thought the other shame with both records is couldn't they have gotten Mark Knopfler in stead of Tom Petty?  TP is so out-classed by the others {full disclosure: I've never \\"gotten\\" TP; maybe that's my failing}.  Any way, with the number of brothers down to 4, TP gets more time than he got on Vol 1, and IMHO that's too bad.  His stuff is generally lackluster; when hard up against Harrison or Dylan or even Lynne, the paucity of his output really comes through.  His greatest gift seems to be his ability to get into the inner circle of much better talents, and bask in the reflected glow.  I think about Knopfler being there instead, and I sigh.  Remember Dylan & Mark teamed up on Infidels way back when, and you can still hear the great synergy all these years later.  A missed opportunity.
0060006986|5.0|What a great book. One of the themes of this work is the reality of death. The author approaches this topic with the delicacy required for the young audience.<br /><br />Wilbur is faced with possibility of an early demise because he is the runt of his litter. His wise and caring friend, Charlotte, devises a plan to save his life and though it works, she looses her life in the end.<br /><br />The book is much more than this theme alone, but it is the most salient and captivating.

After that foundation is laid, he goes on to layout his philosophies the mind set needed to get rich.<br /><br />I was uncomfortable with his references to the \\"universe.\\" He seems to use this term in place of God.

B000QQFKYE|5.0|I ordered this with two-day shipping.  Amazon got it to me before the second day.  It was in mint condition as all of my orders have been.  I'll continue to shop at Amazon.  INLAND EMPIRE is my favorite Lynch to date.  It is the fullest expression a filmmaker has ever put to film.  You can tell, because Lynch--who is always painfully particular about detail, has had the freedom of movement, lenght of film, lighting variability, independent control, and budget of digital film.  He says he will use only digital now.  I think his film open broader as they go, and I'm excited to see what the next one will bring.
1400032717|4.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is a fascinating novel about an autistic teenager who runs away from home.  The story is narrated by the disabled teen himself, so the reader is immersed in a world of bizarre obsessions and pointless details, where other human beings are question marks and math problems are a safe haven from the onslaught of unfiltered perceptions.  The book is unsentimental -- the narrator never \\"outgrows\\" his autism and his parents are hapless and selfish -- yet it succeeds in expanding our minds and deepening our conception of humanity.  It does so by giving a vivid human voice to a mentally disabled person.  No one who takes the message to heart will ever dismiss a lost soul holding his hands over his ears and groaning in a crowded public place as a \\"freak.\\"    That said, \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is not a conventional novel.  Since the narrator is autistic, all of the descriptions are flat, the characters are undeveloped, and the dialogue is stenographic.  There are long passages like this:        \\"Then I imagined a red line on the floor and I walked over to the wall where there was a poster which was a list of places to go and it was alphabetical and I saw 'Willesden Green' and it said '$2.20' and then I went to one of the machines and there was a little screen which said 'Press Ticket Type' and I pressed the button that most people had pressed, which was 'Adult Single' and '$2.20,' and the screen said 'Insert $2.20' and I put three '$1 coins ' into the slot and there was a clinking noise and the screen said 'Take a Ticket and Change' and there was a ticket in a little hole at the bottom of the machine and a $.50 coin and a $.20 coin and a $.10 coin and I put the coins in my pocket and I went up to one of the gray gates and I put my ticket into the slot and it sucked it in and it came out on the other side of the gate.\\"  ['$' has been substituted for the 'Pound' sign.]    I'm sure this monotonous passage, so filled with meaningless literal details, faithfully recreates the way autistic people perceive the world.  But while writing like this can be justified as verisimiltude, it started to eat into my enjoyment of the book after 100 pages or so.  The bottomline is that \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" probably works better as phenomenology than as fiction.  But it should definitely be read.

B00005JPRD|4.0|\\"Across The Universe\\" is two films in one:  the first a linear story, and the second a travelogue in time.  The story aspect, told through Beatles lyrics and musical numbers, is uneven and at times wanting for more depth and direction.  Were \\"Across The Universe\\" judged by this alone, it would not hold up.  Luckily there is the second film within the film, which grandly succeeds in visually and emotionally transporting you back into the sixties, where the love began, minds expanded, and, inevitably, the grand bubble was skewered by reality.  In these segments there is true cinematic brilliance, where the viewer can almost smell the flowers and taste the acid as the music and imagery take them on an unforgettable ride through the beauty and tumult of the times.  Though the very beginning and very end are a bit flat, the rest of this amazing film should be more than enough to both entertain and engulf you in a seductive, disturbing, and intimately moving experience.

B000UFAURI|4.0|Hey ,it's not great,but it's really good.As with all Foo albums there are the real good rockers and on this one ,more acoustic,which I do like a lot.Very similar to the second disc on the last Foo's album. I am one for a mix.This new album definitely has it. \\"The Pretender\\" is trademark ,all out rocking Foo's.The other standouts are Erase/Replace...Long Road To Ruin(similar to \\"Learn To Fly\\"),Cheer Up ,Boys...Summer's End(classic rock sound,Neil Youngesque)...Ballad of The Beaconsfield Miners(fast acoustic mountain intsrumental tune) and But,Honestly(perhaps my second fave on the album). A real fine mix of the older sounds and newer sounds which the Foo's pull off with flying colors. I give it a solid 4.5 stars.If you bought the other Foo albums,there is no reason to delay on this album.Get it now and ROCK!!!!!!
B0002IU988|4.0|Inspired by the guitarist Mark Tremonti memory of a bridge, which he was not allowed to cross as a child.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is a wonderful film for all the reasons that many more conscientous Amazon reviewers than myself have explained; i will not comment on the plot or even the acting, which is superb. One third of the way through the film, however, and I was already fully engaged in the story, the playwright character mentioned one of my favorite sounds, Beethoven's Appassionata sonata; he mentioned it explaining that Lenin was so engaged and softened by this music that he would be unable to lead a revolution if he continued listening to it (Maxim Gorki noted this). The sonata was so beautiful it made him powerless to do what was he believed to be necessary. The Appassionata it turns out, is an important thematic aspect of the film itself. The Stasi efficient, rational, dedicated interrogator gradually regains his humanity at the expense of his career. Whould that all people descriving themselves as '-ists' of any kind re-discover their own humanity, shedding trust in the infallibility of a system of beliefs or practices. The ending of the film is very well done. For those who enjoyed it, I would reccomend reading 'Humanity' by Jonathan Glover or 'Voltaire's Bastards' by John Ralston Saul - and Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solchenytsin, which explore themes similar to those explored in this film.
B000002UC5|5.0|If you were around back then you remember that we all still couldn't quite believe or be absolutely certain if the fab four were all done or not. Hoping, just hoping for that one last album. Never happened really. McCartney turned his back on the boys, told them all to bugg off for a bit and fired up his home brew studio to create a masterpiece. It was a mindblower. When news of this album's pending release came out, everyone was skeptical. Will it be Beatlish kind of music or some new type of sound that Paul had in his private stash or a complete bust. Turned out, it wasn't any of those. It was Paul, in a studio, just being left the hell alone to do what he wanted.  Paul will go down in history as having been the \\"bossy\\" Beatle in the studio. Always sparing and taking swings at the rest of the group (mostly John...no contest there) to try and get the music done his way. He didn't have to do that on his first solo release.. Pure Paul...like it or lump it. We liked it.  Liked it so much that fans eventually changed the name of the album for him. Unofficially retitled \\"A bowlfull of Cherries\\", this recording holds up perfectly in modern day. I wish Paul would go back to that studio and do another one like it. Do away with all the digital this and that, dubs and overdubs etc etc etc and just build another masterpiece. Maybe he still has that 8 track machine around..
B000EOTAM6|3.0|When I first saw the movie, I was very disappointed. I expected more of the animated series action and plotlines in this film. However, it grew on me. I've rented it, then have seen it a couple of times on the premium cable channels, and I have changed my opinion. Once you break the connection with the animated series, it gets better. Let it stand on its own. Charlize Theron is wonderful as Aeon. She's a woman's action heroine. Her portrayal of a driven well trained freedom fighter who uses her agility, toughness, and wits to survive and get the job done is what brings Aeon into a more fully rounded character. She brings life to Aeon more than the animated series did. Some critics say Theron is more disengaged, but I think it's that the character is focused on one thing and that all else, including her sister and compassion, is put to the side.    The other reason for women to see this is not just that it portrays a very strong woman in a heroic lead role, but it has Martin Csokas. I've had a massive crush on him since his portrayal of Borias in the Xena series. He has an understated acting style here, which is unusual for him (think Edward De Kere in Timeline). Some say it's a one note performance, but I think his subdued characterization of the despot Trevor Goodchild reflects the contemplativeness of Trevor, who feels guilt, remorse, and grief. Some say he's passive, but I say he's thoughtful. Another plus for his character - he allows women to protect and defend him (i.e., Aeon and Freya, his aide) without losing his masculinity. He looks gorgeous! Csokas can give a woman a hot flash (or 20!) for sure.    I also liked Sophie Okonedo as Sithandra. I've always like this actress in everything I've seen her in (Hotel Rwanda, the Jackal, etc.). She doesn't let Theron take over the screen. They are well matched.    Now for the problems. Having a more fully realized script would help. It can't be all art direction and special effects. It looks like a 3-D anime, which it great, but the story has about as many holes as Akira. However, the same complaint was lodged against Blade Runner in 1982 (overdone art direction with little plot development and cliched dialogue) and look at it now. It was a bomb when it came out and 25 years later it's a classic and is considered the best sci-fi movie ever. Not that Aeon Flux would get to that status, but give the film a chance.

0060558121|1.0|I was suckered in by virtue of reading all Nebula and Hugo winning and nominated books each year. But folks, the committees were \\"out to lunch\\" on this one. The premise was great, the execution terrible. The plot was lost in blathering vignettes of minute, if any, consequence. At 3/4 through the book, after page flipping through the second hundred pages looking for plot, after exclaiming to my wife: Where's the beef? a number of times, I just gave up. I tore the book into pieces and threw it forcefully into the trash can so nobody could repeat my exact mistake. I do this once every 3 or 5 years. That's how disappointed I was.
1594489505|5.0|Hosseni seems to write what he knows and he writes it well.  A Thousand Splendid Suns is written from the perspective of two Afghan women, and I found the characters more than believable.  They were real women, well developed, a picture painted beautifully in my mind's eye.  And the image of war is more true than the evening news.<br /><br />The story follows the lives of two families as they navigate 30-years of war fought by the Soviets, then the Mujahideen (which translates into English as \\"strugglers\\"), then warlord factions, then the Taliban, and even the Northern Alliance.  One woman, the illegitimate child of a wealthy businessman, discovers that her father is not who she thinks he is and is thrusted into a life of hardship.  Another young woman, who lives a life of liberal education, quickly learns how hard war can be.  It's only through each other that these women learn to understand the meaning of love, loyalty, and family.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns is a shining example of character development and a sound story arch.  At times, I found myself cursing Hosseni for the plot and conflict, but that's what makes the story so enjoyable.  He selects his words carefully and he rarely allows a single detail to go unnoticed.  The pacing struggles at time, but it's never outside of the author's control.  Don't let the year end without first reading A Thousand Splendid Suns.
0143037757|3.0|Having grown up in Eastern Europe during the Cold War, I appreciate the author's attempt at reviewing a chapter of European history that even to Europeans is often set aside.  If the immediate years after the war are not looked at carefully in Europe, so much less are they taught in the US where most people may now be familiar with the Marshall plan and little else.    As such the beginning is very interesting.  There are a few annoyances such as the consistent use of a particular transitional phrase.  Briefly, the author discusses an issue in a country during a set period (such as labor movement in France in the sixties) and then looks at the same issue in another country.  The problem is that the author consistently uses the same transitional phrase.  It looks something like:  In (country A) (restate thesis of the above few pages). The same could (or could not) be said of (country B).  It takes a few moments to find an example of this - see Page 429 - ...Kadar's Hungary-'the best barracks int he laager'-was much envied, though only fitfully emulated.  The second model, Tito's Yougoslavia had managed to avoid the problems of its neighbors...  This approach is repeated endlessly throughout the book.  While analyzing each issue country by country is easy for the author from an organizational standpoint, it prevents the author from going deeper into cross national patterns.  While not a weakness per se, this literary device gets distracting especially when one reads the book as I did - in just a handful of sittings.    The book really goes downhill when the author gets to recent history - i.e. the transition from communism to democracy in Central and Eastern Europe.  Like most left-leaning liberal historians, the author gives too much credit to their hero, Misha Gorbachev.  In doing so, the author makes some (almost) laughable statements.  For example, he claims that Gorbachev's attempts at finding a \\"third way\\" between communism and capitalism were doomed and upon realizing this and he allowed the transition from communism to democracy as the sole alternative.  This is boulderdash as the \\"third way\\" exists in many places throughout the world.  One obvious example is China which has implemented a working capitalist market while retaining communist authoritarian control over the populace.  Garbo wanted exactly this - to stay in power while introducing elements of capitalism.  In order for this to succeed in Europe as it has in Asia all that needed to happen was cooperation from the world's capitalist markets.  It is this support and cooperation that allowed China to adapt itself.  What prevented Eastern and Central Europe from becoming a totalitarian state is not Gorbachev but rather national opposition movements.  In Poland especially this meant the Catholic Church.  In places that had no pro-democracy movements, the \\"third way\\" of authoritarian capitalism established itself just fine.  It's not even necessary to look to Asia to find examples of this, Belarus and for a while Ukraine both settled into \\"the third way\\" of capitalist reforms coupled with repression almost as a reflex.  In whatever way local communists cooperated in the dismantling of communism they did so not because of their inner greatness but because they saw the transition period as the best way to enrich themselves through shady deals in public property.      Lastly, in the Epilogue, the author writes about Europe's collective forgetting of the atrocities of the Holocaust.  Of course, every conquered nation cooperated to some degree with the Nazis in their pursuit of Jews and other Nazi-chosen \\"undesirables.\\"  Extremely annoyingly (page 808) the author equates Poland's guilt over the Holocaust with that of Austria (of all places!)  In support of this he provides one example of religiously motivated violence in Poland - the pogrom in Jedwabne as told by Gross's \\"Neighbors\\".  Of course he fails to mention that many of the claims of Gross's work were subsequentlydebunked (such as the number of victims or the presence and active role of German security forces).  This is particularly strange as the author praises the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, but then proceeds to ignore its findings.    Lastly, even though the author spends a significant portion of the book on the transition from communism to democracy he discusses Pope John Paul II only a handful of times.  At the very least he could have discussed the Papal visits to Poland (all of which had an enormous impact on the anti-communist movement) or the attempt at the Pope's life.  Again, the Pope's contribution, along with that of the US, was at least as important as Gorbachev's.    All and all, a worthwhile read, but don't expect a literary masterpiece. Nor is this without obvious bias.

1428144331|3.0|Nineteen Minutes is the story of a New Hampshire high school shooting that resulted in ten deaths and the wounding of nineteen others, some of whom were left with physical disabilities and mental scars that would be with them for the rest of their lives. It is Peter Houghton's story. Peter Houghton, a sensitive boy with few social skills or friends, was always different in the eyes of his schoolmates. He was a natural target for bullies out to impress their own friends and his life was all downhill from the first day of kindergarten when his new lunch box was thrown out of the school bus window onto the highway where it was crushed by oncoming traffic.<br /><br />By the time that Peter was a high school junior, the same group of bullies had been slamming him into lockers, punching him, verbally abusing him and otherwise generally intimidating him for as long as he could remember. After sixth grade, he had even been abandoned by the one close friend he had had up to then when she decided that she wanted to be popular and realized that her friendship with Peter was going to make that goal impossible to achieve. So when Peter snapped, he snapped big time, and deciding that it was payback time at Sterling High School he changed a city forever in just nineteen bloody minutes.<br /><br />Nineteen Minutes is not a terrible book but it is a disappointing one because it could have been so much more than it turned out to be. Jodi Picoult offers nothing new to the discussion of school shootings, what causes them, or how they can be prevented. Instead, she deals in stereotypical characters and a sideshow romance that add little but pages to her novel. Rather than developing the characters of some of the bullies in the story to give insight into why some people get such great pleasure from humiliating those physically weaker than themselves, she offers up cardboard characters like Detective Patrick DuCharme whose constant one-liners give him more the personality of a stand-up comedian than that of a competent detective. She spends more time developing a romance between DuCharme and Judge Alex Cormier, the mother of one of the victims, than she does in trying to explain why school shootings have become so common in recent years. I did not expect, or want, a romance novel from Picoult but I got one.<br /><br />Picoult's pacing of her story is disappointing because of the way that she so gradually builds up the suspense and mystery surrounding what happened on that fateful day only to end it all abruptly with somewhat of a surprise ending and a quick summary of what happened after the trial. Less time spent on an unnecessary romantic sideshow and more on a better written ending would have made this a much stronger book.<br /><br />The audio version of Nineteen Minutes is read by actress Carol Monda who turns in a competent reading of this 18-disc recording. My only quarrel with Monda's performance is the \\"little boy\\" voice and cadence that she consistently uses for all of her male characters regardless of their age. That quirk made it difficult to take some of her characters seriously and may have contributed to my negative impression of Detective DuCharme.of a competent detective.

0790731452|4.0|This has got be to be the ultimate parody of every 50s sci-fi alien flick. You can't possibly take this movie other than the comedy it was intended to be, it's got spoof written all over it. My favorite scene is Glenn Close, as the presidents wife, getting creamed by a huge falling  chandelier due to alien firearms. The ending is endearing when they discover the remedy to the alien beings lies within a hard of hearing old grandma who fancies the worst melodies on vinyl, repeatedly. The other great scene is the interchanging of human and animal forms in alien saucer. Even the promo for this flick had the aliens with uncouth eyeballs stirring about. Very campy to say the least, and I think Independance Day has met it's match!

I am severally disappointed with WB for this pathetic excuse for an HD presentation of 300. A film which is supposed to be visually stunning and made after HD technology and yet producing garbage that is ultra grainy and flickers in 1080p resolution!? I have played B movies in Bluray that have a better presentation than this sinkhole of cash. WB needs to issue a public apology for this and replace any of these literally broken Blurays. This is pathetic.

0385335997|2.0|So, OK... I admit that I liked Outlander and Dragonfly... but Voyager was just ludicrous. But after slogging my way through Voyager, I feel complete with the series. I realize that this book is supposed to be over-the-top action and people admire it because the lovers aren't in their 20's. But Gabaldon over-uses phrases and all judgements about people are based on what their eyebrows are doing. The setting of the various boats they are in are claustrophobic and Claire is taken hostage so many times in the three books I have read, you would think that she would be used to it. If you want non-stop action, then go for it. But this is definitely a book for plot junkies.

0312360266|4.0|Marked has all the great makings of a novel - great humor, well researched cultural background, and creativity. I'll admit, when I read the first few pages, I feared it would be one of those ridiculous stereotypical cheerleader main characters narrating the story - thank goodness that wasn't so! I found the idea of vampire finishing school interesting, and Ms. Cast pulled it off excellently.     So why didn't this earn a five?  First was the not-so-subtle insults to non-pagan religions.   Second was the fact that Zoey seemed like she was bordering on Mary-Sue-dom. It seemed to me that the author was stretching it a bit: she just happens to be Cherokee, she just happens to be the only one who has a magical cat, her boyfriend happens to randomly be the hottest guy in school (why did he find her so attractive? It didn't seem natural to me).   Third, I personally found the sexual scene in the beginning (and the heavy on going jokes) over the top. Still, it was nothing that made me feel completely uncomfortable.   Fourth? This is a minor thing, but Zoey's friends at the House seemed too set up/diverse to be a natural occurrence.
B00005JPQR|4.0|I'm not going to rehash the story line, as many other reviewers have already done. I enjoyed this third installment to the Bourne series, and thought that it rated up there with the two previous films.    However, I am very surprised that no other Bourne fans seemed to have commented on this, or even seemed to have noticed. The movie begins in Moscow, supposedly right where Bourne Supremacy left off. Bourne is limping, and the Moscow police are looking for him. This is supposed to be right after he goes and sees the girl to tell her that he killed her parents.    But...the Bourne Supremacy does NOT end in Moscow, on a snowy winter day. I even just watched it again, just to make sure I wasn't going crazy. The movie ends in NY, during the summer, when Jason contacts Pamela Landy again and wants to know why she's looking for him. Obviously, judging from the change in weather, it is about 6 months later and Bourne's injuries are all healed.    So why on earth does this movie begin in Moscow? There seems to be no reason for him being there, there is no backstory told, nothing. I found this to be a major flaw, and it was kind of dumb to make it seem like it was just picking up where the last one left off. For one thing, he had been shot and was bleeding as well as limping in Supremacy, at the end of the Moscow segment. So what happened to his gunshot wound, if this was just supposed to pick up where the other one ended?    Anyway, I found this really sloppy and kind of dumb, just to bleep out the NY scenario at the end of the film. For one thing, when Jason contacts Pam Landy in NY several months later, she tells him his real name and birthday, which lays the seed for a small coup on Landy's part in this movie.
B000O179EA|5.0|The picture is absolutely wonderful, and the audio is far greater than anticipated - this film has some seriously hardcore low frequency effects for your subwoofer to feast on. Magnificent presentation on HD DVD!<br /><br />I've never seen this film before now, and I've got to say it is incredible! At first I thought it was trying too hard to be a blockbuster, but as \\"The Frighteners\\" progresses, you discover that it truly deserves to have been one. Its \\"R\\" rating having limited the audience is probably the only reason it didn't reach thaetrical blockbuster status, but kudos to Peter Jackson for making sure he let the film remain what it was meant to be! This movie has its historical significance...it is a very unique film.<br /><br />\\"The Frighteners\\" isn't appropriate for young viewers. It's very much a disturbingly sickening horror feature with seriously demented characters; the FBI agent, John Astin with the mummy, and the motivation behind the plot - such controversy!<br /><br />One can appreciate the difficult task film makers have of pushing the envelope without going \\"over the top\\" and one of the things about \\"The Frighteners\\" seems that it effectively goes right \\"TO\\" the top in several ways.<br /><br />This film has plenty of action, and outstanding special effects. The cast is really great, too!<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"The Frighteners\\" for any horror movie fan!
1594624267|2.0|This is a great book, and my favorite part of Little Women.  It covers the part when Jo goes to New York and meets Professor Bhaer.  However, when I ordered \\"Good Wives\\" I thought it was a sequel that I hadn't read before.  Instead I found that it was a poorly bound and poorly copied (e.g. faint print that's hard to read) copy of Part II of the book Little Women.  If you have the novel Little Women you already have \\"Good Wives.\\"  I sat the books down side by side and compared them, and they are identical.  I'm confused why everyone is referring to this as a sequel to Little Women, unless perhaps when Little Women first came out it ended when the father came home from the war, and maybe Part II was originally printed in a separate volume?<br /><br />However, every copy I've ever picked up of Little Women nowadays already has Part II in it, so if you have Little Women I'd advise you not to waste your money on this.
630521610X|3.0|I won't seperate my reviews for this series, even though I like `em all.  But why does the first one get so much credit, while the other two get so unfairly trashed? The first one has slanderous dialogue-which I hate,and the killer is disappointingly predictable. David Arquette, Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox are what keeps this series interesting. The 2nd one is much better despite a bloody opening, and also has alot more humor,Jerry O'Connell singing `I think I love You' to Neve was a riot too! The third one I thought should've gotten the most credit, because writer Kevin Williamson likes the word slut way too much, the first one proved that, along w/ Dawson's Creek, the Faculty and Teaching Mrs. Tingle. I'm glad he couldn't write the third one, because Ehren Kruger did better anyway. Kudos to Wes Craven though for only going to 3 chapters, as slasher films so often don't do, and they don't know when to quit, this one covered all aspects of the story w/out going overboard.  As for the reality excuse for the `s' word, that won't work on me, read my other reviews, you'll see why.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|If you understand what \\"Nuff' Said\\" is all about than you know Old-School Comic Book Collecting before video games were the major form of adolescent entertainment. Before 7-11 turned into Quickie Mart, you could get your Amazing Spiderman and Uncanny X-Men comics off the racks for .40 cents. Marvel comics and myself go back aways...<br /><br />Anyway, if you have not seen this movie, stop reading as there are some semi-spoilers!<br /><br />Spiderman 2 was a fantastic sequel due in part to the character development of Doctor Octopus throughout the movie. Raimi made us want Spidey to defeat him. The first movie also delivered the goods for Comic Book fans. Spidey's origin as well as his rivalry with the Green Goblin were spectacular. Their battles took you out of this world and into a Real-Life Comic Book world with heroes and villians.<br /><br />NOW, part 3... The biggest issue I have with this film is KEEP YOUR DAMN MASK ON SPIDERMAN! You are not Peter Parker Man with a Spiderman suit on. What was the deal with the \\"New Goblin\\" having a mask on for 30 seconds of the entire movie! I wanted to see him delve into the occult and become the \\"HOBGOBLIN\\". Part 3 could have centered around that (in my opinion). Topher's face was on a Venom Suit most of the movie also. The Headless Horseman could have been the villan, that way we would'nt have to see the actors faces the entire movie!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />This movie suffered from Villan Overkill. What made the first 2 great were the hero/villan rivalries. Sandman was wooden and emotionless. Never once does he say \\"OMG, I can make myself turn to sand and kick A** now\\". His powers are there and that's that. The Goblin and Doc Oc were more aware of what they had become. There is no time for the Sandman's character to really \\"interest\\" us and make us hate him.<br /><br />Gwen Stacy is a very important figure in Spiderman comic book lore and could have been more vital in the movie. Obviously, too much is going on already in the movie at this point!<br /><br />The Venom part of this movie is the worst part for the Hardcore Fans! The Venom/Spiderman rivalry is STELLAR in the Marvel Comics Universe. What a disappointment it was to not see a hulking, muscular Eddie Brock as portrayed in the comics. Eddie towers over Parker and has true hatred for Parker for ruining his career. Why not cast Richard Simmons as Eddie Brock? He is scarier than Topher Grace. There are too many semi-important elements/sub-plots in this movie to have time to give Venom any screen time! SPOILER AHEAD...and why does'nt he just kill Parker when he's lying helpless in the clock tower. Venom can \\"sense\\" parker because he had previously bonded with the suit. Forget \\"sense\\" just look up! As vicious and blood-thirsty as Venom is in the comic books, he would have killed him in the tower.<br /><br />Everyone, including Peter Parker, cries too much in this movie also (WITH HIS MASK OFF, OF COURSE).<br /><br />SPOILER** At the end of the movie instead of crying like a baby he should have PUT HIS MASK ON, I REPEAT - PUT HIS MASK ON - PUT IT ON DAMMIT - and kicked Sandman's butt! I was waiting for the movie to end at this point anyway.<br /><br />BTW, NO ONE CLAPPED IN THE THEATRE AND THIS WAS OPENING NIGHT 12AM! I REMEMBER THINKING THAT I HAD JUST SEEN ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING SEQUELS I HAVE EVER SEEN. 3 POTENTIAL SPIDERMAN MOVIES CRAMMED INTO ONE!!!of this movie is the worst part for the Hardcore Fans!

B00005JPQR|5.0|The third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It is a political film more than a plain entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity: he really killed some one who became his corpse. But the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the CIA within a Blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all American citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people. Who was one essential officer of the CIA up to 1980, when he became vice president? That goes along with what is being said on the Internet. Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the CIA is a woman and that woman gets the Senate involved in a general investigation. A woman and the Senate; read my lips. In the USA politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign: it is music and the cinema. Right now Hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia, academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general, and this film in particular, to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the Senate. So go and watch the film. It is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for, but no one is able to pretend it won't come: the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B000KQGOA4|5.0|Imogen Holst, the composer's daughter and a fine conductor in her own right pronounced this the finest performance of this piece she had heard. It's easy to understand why.<br />Mars moves forward with grim force and a kind of nervous energy that can raise goosebumps. The VPO, one of the great orchestras and one of the great opera orchestras, has remarkable tone colors to offer: grim metallic trumpets, heavy trombones, horns like human voices, strings that sing and sting, crushing percussion.<br />Venus brings cool peace. It seems almost stylized, a kind of art deco sound with rich tone - the VPO sounds like the orchestral distillation of all of the great singers who these players have accompanied - but formal restraint.<br />Mercury flies along with speed, but also with elegance. You can hear the speed, but not the effort that produced it.<br />Jupiter is sheer power - Brahmsian (or even Elgarian - what a shame that Karajan never conducted Elgar, his second symphony would have been amazing) in its breadth and nobility - but, for all the power of the concept, this Jupiter moves along. No Falstaff here! The richness, nobility, and sheer naturalness of the big tune - the trio section, if you will - is wonderful, as is the amber-to-gold sound that the normally silvery VPO comes up with for it.<br />Saturn opens with icy remoteness. A good reminder of the vast range of color that the VPO commanded. The dry to lamenting sound of the first violin entry is like a cry of protest against the clock ticking inexorably in the background. The trombones are ghostly and noble in their procession and the sweeping up of the whole orchestra into the energy is like a gathering of the world into the inevitable progress, with colossal brass chords marking the progress and a huge cry of protest echoed down the orchestra until the starry sky of serene acceptance suddenly appears.<br />Uranus is brisk and tricky and Neptune remote and evocative.<br />Don Juan was a Karajan specialty. He recorded it in concert with Concertgebouw in 1943, made his debut with the Philharmonia in a concert that included it in 1948, and made a memorable recording with that ensemble. He also recorded it at least twice later with the Berlin Philharmonic. All of these are memorable recordings, as is this. Karajan was attuned to Richard Strauss as he was to a handful of other composers. This recording has the energy and forward movement that Karajan offered in 1960, at the peak of his early maturity. It also has the unique sound of the VPO, with its sweet strings, tangy winds, and heroic brass (I love the molten sound of the horns in the big call ten minutes in).<br />Decca's sound is deep and vivid. It's startlingly immediate in this remastering. There's some hiss and a bump from a tape join partway through the big oboe solo in the Strauss - the Holst sounds as if they did it (or at least each planet) in one take like Karajan's amazing second recording of The Rite of Spring.<br />A wonderful archive of splendid music-making. They don't make conductors or orchestras like this any more.<br />Karajan's remake of the Holst in Berlin is also fine, but this one is more lively and immediate. Don Juan sounds like a great opera here.<br />Well worth the price, though if you can find the Decca box with 9 discs of Karajan in Vienna, that's even better.ncertgebouw in 1943, made his debut with the Philharmonia in a concert that included it in 1948, and made a memorable recording with that ensemble.

B000UGG39Q|5.0|I'm not going into the story of the past five years, what happened since Down II, blah, blah, blah.  This album is very different from the other two LPs. The songs on the other albums were all good and listenable, but there were stand-out tracks on both, sort of their \\"hits\\". Over the Under isn't like that. Every song seems to fit into one single groove. The changes and differences are more subtle, but they are there for sure. This album is darker, lyrically and musically. Phil is one of the most personal lyric writers, but he goes off the edge this time. The music is deeper with a heavier groove. It reaches deep.  Sit in a dark, quiet room and crank this up. Then you'll understand.
B000RG1FMO|1.0|Kanye West is a producer who knows how to create buzz and a few pop singles. I had low expectations, and was still severly disapointed.  The cd was supposed to be a fun gift for my friend.  Instead it was a waste and a crappy gift.  We skipped through at least half the tracks on the first listen because the beats were either cheesy or weak.  Later listenings confirmed the first impressions.  Download his singles and save yourself some time and money.  Or better yet, pick up Talib Kweli's new joint.
B000002UB3|5.0|In my humble opion, Abbey Road by the Beatles has to be one the best recorded albums of all time. Only someone rigid in their tastes for country music (sorry, Billy Bob) might not enjoy this timeless creation. All the world has rejoiced in its splendor. Elevators used to drone orchestrated copies of these beatiful songs. If you don't own a copy of this, please wait no longer. Buy this and place in your time capsule next to the telephone, computer, light bulb, etc. When aliens discover this album, they will most assuredly contact Amazon for more good music. - Ciao

Hey, if you discovered the cure for cancer yesterday what would people expect from you tomorrow? Kind of sucks doesn't it? Any way, just buy this album if you liked either of the first two (if you didn't, you are one of maybe 10 in the world who didn't). Third Stage has that pure Boston guitar rocking sound with the flawless vocals you loved before. - Ciao
B000TLMWLK|5.0|I am a longtime fan of Johnny Cash and have been waiting for a release on CD of the LP from decades ago, and never expected to see a DVD.  While I would have particularly liked to see selections of just his own performances from the show, the DVD includes a wonderful mix of other performers, many of whom were introduced to a TV audience for the first time, thereby detailing Cash's contribution to the music of the day and his own musical range.  This is a must-have for any serious Cash fan.  That it is an outstanding selection, and the quality production is icing on the cake!
B000OPOAM0|4.0|Sarah Conner(Linda Hamilton)is a young woman who has one of the early points in her life made well. Not only does Sarah Conner's job as a waitress support her,her life outside of work is nothing but flashy fun.    But,one day,things take a sudden and dangerous turn around the corner for Sarah Conner. This is when Sarah Conner discovers that she is the target of The Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger),a cyborg from the future that has been sent from time to assasinate her. The reason for this? To save the future by changing the past,in order to prevent Sarah Conner's future son John from being the only hope of mankind.    Now,on the run from danger,Sarah Connor only has one real aide and help throughout the disastorous and terrifying event she finds herself going through. Who is that real aide and help? A cyborg by the name of Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn),who,before he knows it,will be through a lot more than just protecting Sarah Conner.    \\"The Terminator\\" is one of the most richly executed films every made. The plot for \\"The Terminator\\" is very creative,and is skillfully and carefully brought to life by director James Cameron. Throughout \\"The Terminator\\",James Cameron cleverly tackles both science fiction and action. His take on both science fiction and action appropriately and entertaingly represent both of the two genres,without going overboard in any way,shape,or form. The character chemistry in \\"The Terminator\\" is impeccable,and balances out \\"The Terminator\\" well,contributing to the goodness of the film. The beauty of \\"The Terminator\\"? Unlike most films similiar to it,you really don't know who will win:the good side,or the bad side.    It is also worth noting that \\"The Terminator\\" does deliver some very strong acting. In Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn's performances as Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese,Hamilton and Biehn make a perfect onscreen team. Their take of the action succeeds in going along with the story,not trying to be action stars and being able to maintainthe limnits. The chemistry in the script for \\"The Terminator\\" is intelligently brought to life by Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn,and keeps the heat up throughout the film. Also,despite the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger will never be taken seriously as an actor,Schwarzenegger's performance as The Terminator is nothing but brilliance. As The Terminator,Arnie keeps one wondering what will happen next,and makes the suspense of the film both entertaining and chilling. Add everything together,and you have the perfect film that posseses the qualities of a perfect and successful film.    As for this DVD version of \\"The Terminator\\",the lenticular cover is very cool. It is something that any hardcore fan of \\"The Terminator\\" will appreciate. But,considering the fact that the only bonus feautures here are the original theatrical trailer for \\"The Terminator\\" and DVD-Rom script to screen(which you have to access with your computer,with only two computer programs being accessible),you may just want to buy the DVD version of this film that comes without the lenticular cover.    Need I say more?
0143034901|5.0|This book is CRAZY! It has absolutely everything: love, murder, betrayal, incest, and more! \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is set in post-war Barcelona in the year 1945. Daniel, a young boy, accompanies his father to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books one evening and finds a book written by Julian Carax. After reading the book, Daniel is so engrossed that he attempts to locate other books by the same author, but cannot find any. However, he does discover stories about a mysterious man named Lain Coubert, which is the same name Carax uses for the character of the devil in one of his novels. Lain Coubert has spent years tracking down copes of Carax's books and setting fire to them. In time, Daniel comes face to face with Lain Coubert, and Daniel soon finds himself immersed in a story that began many years ago and may very well threaten his own life.<br /><br />This is a truly excellent book that has the makings of a great gothic novel. It took me a long time to finish reading it because there are so many characters and plot twists to keep track of, but the intriguing story was well worth the effort I put into it. I couldn't put this book down. I highly recommend it.
006017322X|4.0|This ever-popular, Pulitzer prize-winning novel is written from the first-person perspective of \\"Scout,\\" a young girl growing up in a small, segregated Alabama town during the Great Depression. I did not read any descriptions of the book before I began it, so it was fascinating as I began to realize what it was about. Its gentle, childlike, Tom Sawyer, heart-of-America cadence drew me in, but provided a counterpoint to the hypocrisy, racism, and bigotry that was revealed in the town little by little.    The writing itself, of course, is excellent, telling the story subtly but powerfully - or perhaps the power is in its very subtlety. In my opinion, this is not the most compelling book I've ever read on this issue, but it is significant and memorable.

I thought \\"sure, it will probably be a fun read\\" but I was really unprepared for how much I enjoyed this book.  My wife and I typically describe books and movies in a \\"writer meets writer\\" format and I described this book at Robert Heinlein meets Joss Whedon.  Great setting and action plus really snappy and clever dialog.    I liked this book so much that I immediately ordered the next two books set in the series (which I also loved).    I highly recommend this to anyone who likes sci-fi.
0553296981|5.0|You know the storyline - a Jewish girl, her family, and some friends go into hiding for two years during the Nazi regime in Holland. Said girl writes her thoughts and observations of her life during this time in a diary, which is found and published after her death in a concentration camp. It has become a classic, and it was written by a young teenager.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of this book will forever be Anne's powerful narrative voice. Her words speak, and more than that they smell and taste and touch. She gives her diary, \\"Kitty,\\" an intimate portrait of life in the \\"Secret Annexe,\\" both public and private - of the ups-and-downs of people's relationships, of her inner struggles and growth, of her love. Reading her diary is like looking through the window at the war from two perspectives - one from the outside in, at the life of a girl and a family who were sucked into the Nazi vacuum through no fault of their own; and the other from the inside out, at the crazy world war swirling around the epicenter of one fourteen-year-old girl.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Some SPOILERS here.<br /><br />TORCHWOOD, a spinoff of DOCTOR WHO, is yet another television show with nifty science-fiction and paranormal elements, and it IS a marvelous and fun show. The premise: the Torchwood Institute is a covert organization given the responsibility of being Great Britain's watchdog against all things malicious and extraterrestrial. This series revolves around the amazing exploits of Torchwood Three, a branch of the Torchwood Institute which operates out of Cardiff, Wales.<br /><br />In the debut episode \\"Everything Changes,\\" Policewoman Constable Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) witnesses a deceased stab victim's temporary return to life. This becomes her introduction to a hidden world of frightening monsters, incomprehensible alien technologies, and extreme paranoia. She meets the very charming Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a man displaced in time and leader of Torchwood Three. Oh, and he can't die. He obligingly places Gwen in the loop: \\"We don't just catch aliens. We scavenge the stuff they leave behind, find ways of using it, arming the human race against the future.\\" Fairly soon, after some fairly interesting - not to mention, harrowing - moments, Gwen finds herself recruited as the group's police liaison. And with a spacetime rift located in Wales, she and the other Torchwood members remain up to their necks in weirdness and peril. On a more personal scale, Gwen struggles to maintain a normal relationship with her lived-in boyfriend. It's not easy being Scully.<br /><br />I happened to stumble onto this dark, moody series on the On Demand's BBC America channel and became speedily hooked. It's done by the Brits and they bring their sensibilities to the table. Its tone, while somewhat reminiscent of the X-FILES, also does remind me a bit of DOCTOR WHO, but that one's to be expected as these two shows are closely linked. In fact, the word \\"Torchwood\\" is an anagram of Doctor Who and was a security code used by the crew of that series to foil television piracy.<br /><br />The sci-fi elements naturally loom large. The show immediately immerses the audience in its peculiar and scary universe lurking just behind the veil of normality. Cool and wondrous gadgets and concepts abound: perception filters, invisible lifts, ghost machines, time rifts, resurrection gloves - you know, screwy science-run-amok stuff. The show's contents do tend to stray toward more adult themes, and the casual use of earthy language underscores this. As a reflection of this maturity, the show isn't shy in depicting several of the team members as leaning towards an alternative lifestyle. Captain Jack Harkness himself is bisexual and disarmingly casual about it. In the sexually-charged \\"Day One\\" the baddie is a snog-happy (wonderful word, \\"snog\\") space creature who snuffs out its victims at the moment of orgasm (As Jack off-handedly comments regarding one casualty: \\"He just...came and went.\\"). So, no, not for the young 'uns, this show.<br /><br />There are 13 episodes in the first series, and they are thoughtful and lushly plotted and just as splashy as their American counterparts. The CG is certainly there. The mostly British actors are very good. Gwen Cooper is played by Welsh actress Eve Myles, and Gwen makes for an engaging and ideal point-of-view character. The popular Captain Jack Harkness, last seen in the DOCTOR WHO series, comfortably crosses over into this show and drags actor John Barrowman with him. Barrowman, by the way, is magnetic! The cast of characters is interesting and complex and develops as the series progresses, with team members keeping their share of dark and dangerous secrets. One of them even turns traitor, dies, and comes back from the dead. Needless to say, the group dynamics tend to be volatile.<br /><br />One negative is that most of the episodes are self-contained, which introduces a certain faltering in overall cohesion and continuity. However, the episodes will still suck you in. The best ones, in myopinion, are \\"They Keep Killing Susie\\" (Former Torchwood member Susie Costello returns), \\"Out of Time\\" (great and melancholy episode with three aircraft passengers from 1953 disembarking in the present and forced to acclimate to this brave new world), \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\" (very good time travel story as Jack and Toshiko journey temporaly to 1941 and meet the real Captain Jack Harkness, whose identity Torchwood's Jack would soon steal), and the exciting season finale \\"End of Days\\" (Wales' time rift becomes unstable and begins causing disturbing temporal anomalies).<br /><br />Hmm, the Doctor Who universe seems to be rapidly expanding. First, this riveting Torchwood offshoot and now followed by THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES (longtime Doctor Who-philes will recall investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, a popular companion to the 3rd and 4th Doctor). As a fan, I say keep it coming.

B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I listen to a lot of different kind of music (everything you can think of except for rap, and even then I like some hip-hop) but typically I mostly listen to  hardcore punk and various GOOD metal bands (there is a staggering amount of horrible ones.)  This is neither punk nor metal and yet it is the first time I felt compelled to write a review about anything, that's how good it is.  I bought \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" in hopes that it would do just that... which it, actually, surprisingly enough did.  I was going thru a rough time and for some reason out of the hundreds of albums I own of all different types of music, this is the ONLY one that helped me get thru the worst time of my life.   Although I regret to say now I can't bring myself to listen to it because whenever I hear any of the songs it brings me right back to that time, but that's a personal thing. It's a good album.  You should buy it.
1572705329|4.0|A classic gem done full justice by the superb reading of Prunella Scales. A great listening experience was marred, however, by a surprising and disappointing flaw in disc 8 which rendered the final track unintelligible.    It would be much appreciated if you could replace this faulty disc, as such a literary masterpiece deserves to be presented and preserved in mint condition.    The damaged disc apart, Jane Austen would surely applaud this excellent rendition of her beloved Emma.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Very good, If you love superman, you will love Smallville.  I started watching it in season 6, and now I can't get enough.  Season 1 got me going from the start.
B000THKHW0|5.0|Warchild is the source of the FM radio favorite \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\", which might just be the *worst* song on the album. 'Queen and Country' and 'Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day' are wonderful tunes replete with  Ian Anderson's baroque lyrics and composition; this album is a 'must have' for any Tull fan, new or old.

B00014X8KO|5.0|I watched Memories back in the 90s when it was still hard to come by here in the US.  Arriving in the US nearly 10 years after it was made, the film stands among the best of the current crop of anime, as it should being produced by some of Japan's masters.  And while the animators are different on each of these pieces, the constant is Otomo, providing the stories for all three and himself directing the final segment.    The first segment is the beautiful and somewhat horrific Magnetic Rose, where a ship's crew stumbles upon a world produced by a girl's memories.  Imagination in designed is paired with a beautiful soundtrack, heavily based on Madame Butterfly.  Despite the scifi aspect commonly found in anime, this piece has a certain elloquence and beauty to it that just doesn't find its way into modern anime.  I love the way the girl's memories start preying on the ship's crew with some of their own.        The second piece, entitled Stink Bomb is right at home on Otomo's Resume.  Produced by Madhouse studios, the story revolves around a man who contracts a certain odor from a lab that kills whoever smells it.  With tongue firmly in cheek, the story follows the government's folly of trying to contain it.  It reminds me a lot of Otomo's own Roujin Z.  It's the lightest segment on Memories, preparing the viewer for the conclusion.    Otomo directs the final segment, Canon Fodder, which shows a dark dystopic world where the inhabitants fire canons at each other all day.  While some of the artwork seems almost comic, the mood of the story is not.  Otomo again provides a satire criticizing the very thought of going to war and the sometimes ambiguous reasons for fighting.    After watching Memories, I couldn't help but feel that Otomo has positioned himself as something of a satirist in the world of manga and anime.  He did it with Akira, though quite subtly, and moreso with Roujin Z and even in Steamboy.  It's nice to see one of the masters still at the top of his game,producing meaningful works high above the sex and violence fare of lesser anime titles.
