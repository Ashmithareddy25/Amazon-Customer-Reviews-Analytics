B005LAII80|3.0|It was a pretty ok movie I wish it would have been more like the one with Sylvester Stallone .
0425221806|5.0|I just finished reading this and thought it was excellent!  I was thinking it would be boring - chasing around creatures escaped from a lab.  But no, this had twists and turns, nice short chapters, and it kept my interest right to the end.  I never thought I could weep in a horror story but I could feel a tug on the heart strings toward the end.  The prose in this is just genius and I found myself underlining like crazy and folding down page corners so that I could go back and re-read certain parts - they make you think.  I think Koontz is truly a gifted writer and although I like other books by him, this is my very favorite - a real keeper.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|Great movie. My kids love the Lilo & Stitch series and this is the perfect movie for them. I highly recommend it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A wonderful book, but heart-wrenching as well. Beautifully written with humor, sadness, but always hope. I highly recommend this book.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Great movie to watch in 3-D. Would recommend to all you you 3-D TV owners. Have not watched the regular DVD yet.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|The &#34;Rango&#34; character &#34;chose&#34; to be who he was and did not let anyone else set his limits. He had a few moments of self doubt but in the end became selfless and despite fears/reservations stood up for what he believed in and stood up for himself.  The movie could have just been seen for it's entertainment value but it really had a deepermeaning (to me) and a message to delver. We each need to find our own mesage in the film.
B0092G1O8A|5.0|I loved it and can't wait for the next one to come out!! It followed the book really well. Very happy
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Buy a few stick them where you might need them, cars, camping gear, emergency kits, and forget about them. Affordable and useful.
B007SGM084|5.0|An amazing read...not at all what I expected!  One more book please to see how they live as a family!
B004Q3RDVG|5.0|Excellent book, can't wait to see what else Lisbeth will get up to. Well written book. Now on to the girl who played with fire.
1439156816|4.0|Some contemporary reviewers seem disappointed in thinking that King was presenting a manual of technique or a 'how to' on the art of writing, this assumption is saved by the title suffix; 'A Memoir of the Craft'. This narrative serves more as a biography than a guide on how to write - for that one should solicit Strunk and White (incidentaly, a commentary that King happens to happily endorse in this book).  However, setting initial expectations aside, 'On Writing' is not a disappointing read.  The first half of the book covers the life of a oft-troubled Stephen King related with sardonic and, sometimes, self-deprecating humor.  No stone is left unturned in Kings anthology of his childhood and adolecent years; being raised by a single mother, nightmarish baby-sitters, rebelling against high school teachers and a dangerous foray into drugs and alcohol all compile to reveal the mind of this intriguing and succesfull writer.  The later half of the book talks about writing.  No earth-shattering revelations here, but good reminders all the same.  Keep the story on cue, be careful with adverbs, write-read-re-write and take off 10% all good points to remember when writing.  Probably should have paid heed when I wrote this review...
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|And well written....i felt i was there. I'm happy i read this book. Hope in a world torn by sadness.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|we all 15,18, and 43 year old have really enjoyed this book. It is fun to discuss together. We also liked Frankenstein.

B00B2TTVNU|5.0|For a long time, I have considered these piano concertos the very best ever composed (followed closely by Tchaikovsky's & Mozart's in this genre) and the only set I had ever heard that I considered \\"definitive\\" was the Abbey Simon set with Leonard Slatkin conducting the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. No other recordings had ever even come close in my opinion.<br /><br />Well, I just heard of Valentina Lisitsa a few days ago on my favourite classical music station as they aired her performance of the rhapsody which, at the end the radio host exclaimed, \\"Yes! She nailed it!\\". Well, being such a big fan of these works for piano & orchestra By Rachmaninoff I didn't waste any time purchasing this new complete set and WOW, I was really blown away for over two hours this morning as I listened from start to finish. Valentina put on such an astounding display of magnificent virtuosity with the LSO matching her every step of the way that I decided to write this brief review touting this outstanding new set of recordings. Her technique is flawless, she plays with great feeling and when the music begins to ramp up she plays thunderously as well! Conductor Michael Francis did an outstanding job too and when you add in the state of the art sound quality, I have finally found a set of these great works that equals my Abbey Simon set.<br /><br />I cannot more highly recommend purchasing these new recordings featuring Valentina Lisitsa, I think you will be very, very happy if you do. (My reason for mentioning the other set (Abbey Simon) is to encourage you to seek his performances out as well, as there are distinct differences in style, tempo, and overall interpretation between them and now I have two \\"definitive\\" sets to enjoy! To locate just type in here on Amazon.com \\"Rachmaninoff Complete Works For Piano & Orchestra Slatkin\\").<br /><br />A special thanks to Decca for signing this young lady to a recording contract, you certainly picked a winner!!<br /><br />And to Valentina, do you take requests? I'd sure like to hear you perform the piano trios of Tchaikovsky & Rachmaninoff as they too are high up on my list of great piano works and I would be delighted to hear YOU play them. Thank you for this wonderful music!<br /><br />Again, highly recommended listening!! Enjoy & God bless :-)

The back board plate installs easily but the clamping mechanism on the front is much more difficult to line up. Once in place it functions very well.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This CPU is a phenomenal processor. It arrived early no doubt to the excellent packaging speed. Came with a brand new heat sink, and was in its original box protected by a good amount of package paper. I would highly recommend getting this if your upgrading or budget building. A lot of great perks with this CPU as well in which its unlocked for possible over clocking, the quad cores are a must for those gaming and your multitasking needs. and its just a good solidly built processor.

B000GGSM7G|3.0|The problem with the deluxe edition of this release is the same as it is for the others:  It is only for the completist who must have everything The Cure have ever recorded.<br /><br />First:  Disc 1, The Top.  This LP was Robert Smith's effort at keeping The Cure alive after a year of releasing singles and struggling along with just himself and Lol Tolhurst as the remaining members augmented by session muscians.  The result is an uneven album.  Shake Dog Shake picks up where Pornography left off.  From there the lp veres all over the place.  From eccentric numbers like Birdmad Girl, The Catepillar (the single from the lp), and Dressing Up to a punk influenced number, Give Me It.  The album and the cover art are also reflective of Smith's use of pyschedelics at the time.  The album was not as poppy as the singles that came out the previous year but it is more pop oriented than the three previous lps.  It reflects the transition Smith was taking The Cure through at the time.<br /><br />Disc 2 compiles demos, rarities, and some live material.  Most of it is a complete waste of time.  There are interesting demos of Happy The Man and Throw Your Foot (both ended up as b-sides to the 12\\" of The Catepillar).  The other interesting demo is a song called A Hand Inside My Mouth.  A reworked version of this song ended up on the Half An Octopus EP as New Day.  (A Man Inside My Mouth sounds very different to this demo.)  Also there is a live track, Forever (version) that was previously only available on Curiosity.  This disc would have been better if it stuck to either unreleased tracks (and I am not talking demos either) or included a complete concert from the tour in support of this lp.  (Concert was a compilation of tracks from various shows on the UK leg of the tour and was not a complete set.)  Or even compiling the singles from the previous year complete with the long version of Just One Kiss (which is superior to the short version on Japanese Whispers and I have not seen it on cd yet) and the remixes of Let's Go To Bed and Love Cats that appeared on the 12\\" singles.<br /><br />The notes in the accompanying booklet offered little in the way of new information.  And as in the booklets for the other deluxe editions, Smith did not miss an opportunity to put Tolhurst down.  I don't know if Smith was being honest about Tolhurst in each of these booklets, but he leaves little doubt about him holding Tolhurst in contempt still.  It would be nice to hear Tolhurst's side of the story or at least know what he did to warrant such scorn.  Afterall, Smith doesn't excactly come across as an angel in the booklets for Faith, Pornography, and The Top.<br /><br />Footnotes:  I am a long time fan of The Cure--fan since 1980.  I feel their first four lps were their best and that Head On The Door was their best lp after Pornography.  Disintegration and the resulting tour were the beginning of the end for The Cure for me.  And as hardcore Cure fans know, I took the title for this review from something Steve Severin said about Smith when asked about the troubles the Banshees had while recording Hyaena.it on cd yet) and the remixes of Let's Go To Bed and Love Cats that appeared on the 12\\" singles.<br /><br />The notes in the accompanying booklet offered little in the way of new information.

B007TNS6JI|4.0|I ain't board yet but I don't like the idea that you have to wait to get your upgrade if any thing thou should just be able to equip the item and have a upgrade with it when u buy the upgrade other than that the game is great
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I have listened to this over and over.  John Mayer live beats any studio recording he has done.  Check out Where the Light Is for more amazing playing.

B0019HQIGS|5.0|John Mayer live is soo much better than any studio recording he has done.  This one in particular is great because you get an acoustic performance, a blues performance from the John Mayer Trio, and a long set of a normal Mayer concert.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Another great record from Depeche Mode. They keep on producing great records that keep fans surprised and satisfied, cant wait till next one.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent of some of the worst trials that an individual can face & how love & patience can heal.  Loved it!
B001RTSPVY|1.0|Don't buy this if you're dependent on closed captions as we are for my Dad, who is hard of hearing, as the subtitles are in French only! Why?! There is no good reason for this. Now I remember why I dislike buying sight unseen. A waste of money.
0385349947|5.0|I've enjoyed reading Sheryl's personal and professional struggles and can relate to many of them.  I appreciate the research she did and the statistics she shares.  Although, I did not buy the book (I checked it out from the public library), I'm glad that I have taken the effort to read it.  There are some really good \\"take aways\\".
B007FIY3VW|2.0|Works nicely on short documents (a few pages), but I edit a lot of large documents (50 pages or more). Olive freezes and crashes constantly when I try to open and edit the big ones, is useless to me for that reason. Otherwise it's a nice word processing program if you just do short stuff.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is just as much fun as the temle run games. I didnt like this type of game at first but it sorta grew on me after a while. I would reccommend this game to anyone who is tired of the usual games like puzzles.

B009SJ3GUK|2.0|the first series was WAY better!  What happened, did they get different writers or what?????  The first series rocked...this one, not so much
B005GYGCOI|2.0|I think that the Kindle version is not user-friendly and it's hard/difficult to find the needed information.<br />More practical details about touristic places needed.
B004XISI4A|3.0|As the series continues, all our favourite characters appear, though it feels always too fleetingly. The book has not fallen into the trap of resetting the scene and the road &#34;home&#34; seems to be in sight for some of the pretenders.
B00A7L00XE|5.0|Hear an interview of these 2 on NPR one morning and ordered it. Great blues sounds and vocals, great cd to put on in the background of a party or in the car
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun match 3 game with a bit of story and travel thrown in. Takes a good bite out of those long waits at the airport and erases the minutes on long flights. Good graphics, etc.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great disney pixar movie! Great moral to the story between the daugther and the mom. Great graphics and Scottish music.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|all the playback was excellent as expected... the packaging (the plastic part that holds the discs inside the box) was damaged before I opened it and is pretty darn ugly every time I open the set.<br /><br />.. its several scratches on the clear plastic packaging in the area around the second disc.  its all superficial, and no discs were damaged, but its pretty disappointing to open a new purchase to see it suspiciously looking used.  (i do know it was not a used copy; as it was a pre-order purchase that was fulfilled by Amazon; and was opened by me only a few days after it was released to the market)<br /><br />I am sure I am one of the very few with damaged box-set pieces.. buy it!!!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Awesome movie!!! Great cast, awesome story line and gory! Just wish they would have stuck to the time period more and left out the nudity. Other than that great movie!
B0089LOKHG|3.0|This was just a good book. I hesitate to say great because of the ending.  I expected closer but there wasn't any.  You are left to determine your own ending.  We don't know who Lena ends up with.  Weight know what happened to the rest of Lena's family.  We don't know happens to Hana.  We don't know the outcome of the final rebellion.  The ending was a disappointment.
B00AFEY354|5.0|ever. got left-over high school angst? heartache? hormones? this story dug it all up and made it beautful. which is kind of impossible if you think about it. ps, amazon should rule the world.

B005LAIH4A|4.0|I've got to admit that while 2008's Horton Hears a Who! proved Dr. Seuss' material seemed custom tailored to the computer generated animation movement, the story lacked that degree of relate-ability we generally associate with the classics.  While Horton was done by Ice Age's Blue Sky Studios, the 2012 follow-up Seuss to CG piece (The Lorax) was handed off to Illumination Entertainment, the guys who brought us Despicable Me.  To cut to the chase, The Lorax is very enjoyable animated entertainment.  It's got a few flaws and there are the semi-legitimate balks of conservatism plaguing the piece but we'll get to these issues.<br /><br />Coming in at a runtime of 86-minutes, The Lorax wears a PG rating for animated violence and tension but there's no inappropriate language or adult-themes to worry about here.  Costing $70-million to make, the film actually managed to break even in its domestic opening weekend and has since gone on to take in close to $250-million.  In short, while critics were less than impressed with it, The Lorax is considered a resounding commercial success and continues Illumination's impeccable track record of making hits.<br /><br />The story, like the book it's based on, tells of a young boy who goes seeking the truth about what ever happened to real living trees in a town that is complete and utterly artificial.  However, while the book had but a few pages of Seussian verse to tell its tale of environmentalism, a full length feature film would require far more setup to keep from dragging out and there are some creative licenses taken as a result.  Among these 12-year old Ted (named after Dr. Suess himself; Theodor Geisel), in effort to impress an older red haired high-school girl (Taylor Swift), takes interest in these \\"tree things\\" and ventures beyond the walls of his fenced-in town to meet up with a mysterious hermit called the Once-Ler.  The Once-Ler (Ed Helms) eventually agrees to tell Ted (Zac Efron) all about his past and what part he played in the obliteration of the forest and resulting exodus of the wildlife that lived in it.  Thus is the movie's greatest strength and arguably its biggest fault when compared to the source material:  There's an undeniably human element present here that harkens back to such other animated films in recent memory as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs or say Ratatouille to mention a few.<br /><br />Additionally new to the fold is a villain designed to personify corporatism with some beautifully rendered yet hideous hair and a crew of voiceless lackeys.<br /><br />The titular character appears in the Once-ler's flashback as a \\"voice for the trees\\" and comes into the film amidst a whole ensemble of characters beautifully transitioned into 3D directly from the pages of the book including those colorful fuzzy-top trees, marshmallow-eating bears and crooning fish.  This part of the film literally breaks down the limitations of the computer color pallet and just how much color the human brain is capable of processing simultaneously.  The Lorax really is a difficult character to flesh out if you think about it and in the end the gruff Danny DeVito does a pretty admirable job of bringing life to the mustachioed orange ball of fur.  While a strong argument could be made that the character is a bit too abrasive to do the book-character justice, I found him appealing in a sort of sensible Yosemite Sam kinda way.<br /><br />A lot of critics fault the film's pro-environmentalist/ anti-consumerism message, which truly is none too discrete here but it's a rather ridiculous complaint considering that is the core theme of the book on which it's based.  When one stops to consider that consumerism is the very fabric of a successful movie (or book), it's a rather annulling lesson but the way I try to reason it, there are far worse messages coming out of Hollywood.  Besides, the narrative of the film does its best to never take itself too seriously with abundant musical numbers and physics-defying silliness.<br /><br />In all I came away from the piece impressed with some of its visual prowess and particularly impressed with the humor surrounding lead character Ted's interaction with his family.  This piece is certainly an improvement over Horton Hears a Who! and is leaps and bounds better than recent live-action incarnations of Seuss' material (such as Cat in the Hat).  If not quite worthy of adding to your collection, you really can't go wrong with a rental on this one.-defying silliness.<br /><br />In all I came away from the piece impressed with some of its visual prowess and particularly impressed with the humor surrounding lead character Ted's interaction with his family.

B00BLF9FOK|4.0|This is a nice comeback movie for Arnold, it is not one his epic films, but it is a good simple action movie, that could easy be a  modern western. It is set in a small town near the Mexican border, the local sheriff is under staffed and out numbered as a group of bad guys are coming to run over the town, so their escaped drug dealer boss can get to freedom in Mexico. Their is plenty of action, shootouts, car chases and comic relief, to satisfy any action fan.
B0000062Y2|5.0|The product is as good as new.  I am happy to have found it and that Goodwill will be making a profit.
1449410243|5.0|I loved this book.  I've seen these looks on my cat's face many times...now I finally know what she's thinking!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was amazing!  I loved how the author wrote this book, going from one part of her life to the other.  I have read so many books on my kindle and I have never wrote a review before this one, because it's so good.  This book keeps you wondering and guessing through the whole book.  Great read.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I LOVE this version! The graphics are stunning and I prefer the scenery and story much more than the original temple run. Easy and fun to play. My 6 yr old plays it and also loves it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how they give us new places every once in awhile making the scenery different.the characters introduced are interesting
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Great game for kids and adults. I play it as much as my 6 yr old! I also find it a little more challenging than the original Angry Birds and who doesnt LOVE Star Wars?
B001UW58WW|4.0|I've always enjoyed the combination of classical and rock music, and David accomplishes this as well as a anyone I have encountered. The things he can do on a violin are almost beyond belief. I've also discovered that he can compose one of the most beautiful melodies I have ever heard. &#34;Chelsea Girl&#34; is a song that I can never listen to only once. I always play it again as soon I've listened to it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love to play any kind of Mahjong game. This game is easy to understand and challenging. The music is soothing. The tiles are a little small. That's my only complaint and it not a significant one. Enjoy.
0345803507|5.0|Loved all three of the books really look forward to more books put out by this author. Author can really set the scene for the story make you feel like you are there.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It's so hard to put any of them down! GEORGE R.R Martin weaves each book together fabulously. There are always many surprises in each one. You never know what will happen next. A must read!!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|We looked forward to watching this. Mediocre is the only word I have and that is being kind. I am sorry but Best Actor? This film was just not up to speed. A great subject and a lost chance. Don't waste your money instead buy a good book about Lincoln from Amazon and have a good read.
B0091REZMW|4.0|One app I don't regret buying<br />This game has Lots of challenges, a busy game. Glad I bought this one. I love it!!!
B003GK21U8|5.0|One would think that all the spy stories from the 2nd World War have been told. Obviously, not by a long shot judging from this one. It rings so true to the reality of those times that one is carried along in a vortex of emotion and tension right up to the last page
B0006213XA|5.0|A friend of mine liked the movie and I saw this one being sold for a good price so I bought it. The dvd arrived earlier than expected and the case and dvd itself were in perfect shape, no cracks or scratches. Was very pleased with my purchase.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|The last 10% of this story just carried on a bit too long at a stage when everybody knew who the bad guy was bur Harry seemed to have  a problem nabbing him! By this time I was so out of breath and exhausted that I just wished that he would carry on and get it over with Al this does not mean that it&#34;s not a most enjoyable book
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|I loved the movie but greatly enjoyed reading this book.  It is sad and reminds us to be aware of our surroundings and be grateful for our loved ones.
B003GK22D4|5.0|I have made a decision to read all Ken's books that I have not read as yet because I enjoy every single one and I've been through quite a few. At this stage I'm not prepared to say which one I've enjoyed the most This one is one of his most clever novels but I must say that &#34; The eye of the needle&#34; and &#34; Key to Rebecca&#34; are  all  in the same class
B004SOR4H6|5.0|i think tht twitter is a great website and i lik the idea of havin a twitter and u can get addicted very quickly if u rlly enjoy twitter
B004UPALT6|4.0|Must see for any horror fan contains frights and laughs in equal measure. Clever camera work is more effective than modern-day CGI. I wish they made more movies like this nowadays!
0394818237|3.0|This is a great book but unfortunately, as others have noted, it is an abridged version.  It seems disappointing bordering on deceitful that the only place that fact is noted on Amazon is not in the product description but in the line with information about the publisher.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I had no idea what this book was about when I started reading it.  I consider myself both Christian and liberal.  This book was very well written and thought provoking.  It is a definite page turner from the very beginning!  I highly recommend it.
B006TQUNX8|5.0|Nice hard cover book.  Very attractive looking book.  Has the original story in it.  So it is a really good buy.
B0037NVM1I|3.0|Terminator 2: Judgment Day has aged fairly well in the decades since its release.  The CGI may not be as mind-blowing as it was back then, but it still served to tell an exciting, if inelegant, tale about taking your future into your own hands.  As with The Abyss, the director's cut of this movie restores crucial nuggets of information. Knowing, for example, that the Connors decided to reprogram the T-800 to allow it to learn and process information with a more human understanding make one less likely to say &#34;Groan!&#34; when the Terminator gets all gushy and sentimental toward the end.<br /><br />So, the movie is good.  Let's talk about streaming on Amazon Prime and Amazon Instant Video.<br /><br />About a year ago I subscribed to Amazon Prime, in part for access to its large library of movies in both HD and SD.  When I saw that T2 was being offered in HD, I was excited for the opportunity to watch it that way.  but I noticed with this movie, and most others, that streaming in HD is a near impossibility. They say HD is available, but even with a speedy connection, it never is. I am able to stream content over Netflix and Hulu in high definition on a regular basis.  I purchased Cabin in the Woods on Amazon Instant, hoping to watch it in HD, and have been disappointed that I am only able to watch it in SD ever since.  Unless Amazon gets its act together, I won't be purchasing any more content from their Instant Video marketplace.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Good movie.  But it seems like it was edited altogether and doesn't flow as well as it could of done.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|If you like Family Guy or Seth McFarlane, you'll like Ted.  At least, that's the conventional wisdom.  I laughed harder at this movie than I have for any comedy in recent memory, and I like raunchy, rude, base humor.  I also like the '80s Flash Gordon starring Sam Jones.  For me it was kind of like this movie was handed down from heaven.<br /><br />Although I rented it on Amazon Instant, I ended up renting it again on Xbox Video Marketplace so I could actually in high definition.  My internet connection is speedy and Amazon is the only service I've used that absolutely fails to deliver video in HD.  Netflix, Hulu, Crackle... they all do fine.  Amazon Instant Video receives a failing grade in this regard, and judging from the comments I've read online, it's a widespread problem.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is an insanely quick read, that on a base level, rings similar to &#34;Night&#34;. While the sole purpose of the camps is not death, children are still born into a world where any day could be their painful last and basic human rights aren't even known, let alone dreamed of. I encourage everyone to read this book.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Creative, thought provoking and imaginative, right up to the end. Clarke's works are always good reads, but this one is a classic.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|I always read this book when I want an easy read that's amusing and engaging. My favourite Marion Keyes book
B00005JLEU|5.0|Its a great film that my son and I watch together! It holds my attention with the fantasy theme and holds his attention with all the different characters that appear. My sons favorite part is when the girls parents eat the spirits food and turn into pigs!
B004WY2M8I|5.0|Great collection of Anne Rice. Was nice to purchase all the books as one novel. This was a nice introduction to Rice's work
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Stretched to no end. Could not wait for it to end. Special effects not as good as I was expecting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much. I recommend this game to everyone. it is so fun! most awesome game ever!
B004LWZW42|5.0|Just had to see this movie, it was a little different from the other x-men movies, but still was great entertainment.
0375842209|5.0|Wow! This was an amazing novel!!! I cannot believe it took me so long to get around to reading it. I had not thought about reading this because it is labeled as a teen novel. I am not in he habit of reading teen novels, but I feel that this is a novel for everyone regardless of age. With that said, if I had children, I would not allow my child to read this until they are at least a teenager. The book deals with many difficult subjects associated with World War II, Nazis, Jews, Death, bombings, suicide, grotesque war injuries, etc. Death is with a capital D because the novel is told from Death's point of view, an omniscient narrator. Death happens upon Liesel, the Book Thief when he collects the soul of her brother in a train car on the way to her new foster parents. During her brother's funeral, Liesel \\"steals\\" her first book, The Gravedigger's Handbook, even though she cannot read.<br /><br />She is welcomed warmly by her foster father who teaches her to read in the middle of the night when she is awakened by nightmares. Her foster mother welcomes her as warmly as she can by calling her Saukerl and Saumensch (not nice German names), and assigning her some serious chores. She is welcomed into the neighborhood gang by Rudy Steiner who is without a doubt her childhood best friend. They are rabble rousers, stealing food from farmers, and Liesel \\"steals\\" books from the library of the mayor's wife. Liesel's German foster family is also asked to hide a Jewish fist fighter, a war buddy's son from WWI. This small fact puts them in perilous danger, but teaches Liesel volumes about the human condition.<br /><br />Through short succinct chapters, the reader is introduced to this unforgettable cast of characters. I checked this out from the library in order to save money, but I can see that I will soon be purchasing a copy for my library (no stealing) :-).
B0014JGDUC|4.0|Worth the price paid for them.  I work in a hospital setting and on my feet all day . I also have plantar fasciitis and my feet don't hurt I would definitely purchase them again.
B003U6BE8I|1.0|I don't even know where to begin.<br />This movie was awful.  It was painful to try to watch and I GREATLY regret spending $3 to rent it on here.<br />The acting is abysmal.  The writing fails both in over-arching story and individual scene dialogue.<br />The sets are expensive, but the special effects are worse than 1990s CGI.<br />Skip this mess.  It has no redeeming characteristics.
B0012YYZYK|2.0|I was really dissapointed about the sound quality of this. It is not HD it should have improved considerably from the normal DVD. I have both and it is really bad.
B0050KEVO6|3.0|This is really addicting game, but hope you don't have to reset your device or you will lose all progress.  It is interesting what will combine with what to make what.  You want to find all the combinations, but once you do, it doesn't seem like they do updates often enough to add new stuff.
0060936223|4.0|\\"Just Kids\\" is predated by a 1995 biography of Maplethorpe and his relationship with Patti Smith. Like the book I'm about to review, it was very charming; it takes you back to an era where bohemian life was possible, when there wasn't a great obsession with being a success, and people were satisfied with less.<br /><br />Patti Smith comes from a liberal family in a conservative town near Philadelphia. She doesn't fit in, so she takes a bus to Brooklyn and expects to stay with friends near the Pratt Institute. When she gets there, they've moved out, so she couch surfs and ends up with a dropout artist named Robert, who might be gay. For the next four years, they hop from one dirt-cheap pad to the next, eating one meal a day, and making art from cast-off junk.<br /><br />The title of \\"Just Kids\\" is perfect for the book. It's about young people doing what all young people dream of; living far from their parents, doing whatever they want, not having a care in the world, working just enough to support themselves. All those things were possible in 1968 New York. Rent was cheap, and as long as you didn't carry any valuables, you were relatively safe.<br /><br />Nowadays, however, I can't see any of this happening. If Patti and Robert had come to New York City (or even Brooklyn) in 2013, they'd never be able to live this way. The only cheap apartments are in the worst neighborhoods, far from everything. The commute to work would be long, and you'd never be able to have an apartment on a bookstore clerk's salary. Would they mind living six to a tiny apartment in Williamsburg? Would they mind commuting from Brighton Beach all the way to middtown? Would they be happy without an iPhone, a laptop, internet, gym membership, the latest footwear?<br /><br />Bohemian life doesn't flourish in this city the way it did in the 60's. Most of the so-called \\"hipsters\\" live on money from they parents. You've got to remember, patti and Robert wear a mix-and-match of whatever they can get. Today's \\"hipsters\\" wear expensive clothing, eat in costly restaurants, and have high-priced technology.<br /><br />I give this book 4 stars instead of 5, only because it's repetitive. There's too much name-dropping about all her favorite poets, and that distracts from things. I would have like to have seen a greater description of the physical aspect of New York at the time.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Kingsbridge 100 years after Pillars of the Earth, a bustling city with hard working people and a beautiful cathedral.  Meet a wide variety of characters as they live through one of the toughest times in history.  A new, young king, wars with France, and the plague is coming.  Ken Follett again weaves a tale that entrances.  You get attached to each of the main characters and care what happens to them.  Lots of action keeps events rolling.  Take the time to read this instead of watching the made for tv miniseries, it is much better!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Got this upon request for my daughter. she absolutely loves it. I got her this one and the twist and this one is her favorite because its more of a challenge.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The only thing I think I would change is the fact that coins cannot be exchanged for gems. I enjoyed everything else about this app and sadly, this is the closest I will ever come to owning a real horse.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have read thru the forums for a lot of the top headsets and this one by far had the fewest complaints.  It works as expected and it seems to be well constructed.  Beware though :-) when you put them on you can not hear anything going on around you, not even the wife who you just woke up at 2am...
B008VBYN80|5.0|This game is pretty fun, as far as SIM type games go. There are lots of quests to perform to keep you busy. Not only do you build your kingdom you can visit other kingdoms and help out as well as battle invaders of your kingdom. What can I say it's a fun, relaxing game, that requires little thought for those times you are bored but don't want to challenge the brain too much. : )
B0006J28KU|5.0|This is a well written, excellent classic. The cast is superb. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I like this game a lot. I found it to be addictive and thought provoking. I will admit the game is kind of morbid, disturbing and dark, but that's why I like it!! Where else can you kill of the human race and not get in trouble? Seriously this game though morbid and disturbing it is also challenging, thought provoking and highly entertaining. It is definitely worth the .99 and it is worth paying extra for the two special viruses they offer for even more entertainment. This game is a definite 5 stars in my book and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B002ZG97EC|1.0|Very rarely do I actually hate a movie, and even more rarely do I hate a movie so much that, after buying it (which, unfortunately, I did in this case because I saw the trailer which was very misleading and made the film look good) I actually break the disk up into tiny pieces until they can be broken no more. Despicable Me was the first time I seen a movie so stupid, so pointless, and so... well... blah! that I actually disposed of it after watching. Bah, Humbug, right? I know, I know. Just wait...<br />Kids are walking down the street now yelling, \\"It's so fluffy I'm gonna die!\\" which is a stupid quote from a stupid character in this stupid movie. As is \\"It's so fluffy!\\" and \\"Does this count as annoying?\\" *super stupid sounds*<br />The jokes aren't \\"funny,\\" the \\"minions\\" aren't \\"cute,\\" there is nothing to enjoy about this movie. And the worst part is, there is a SEQUEL coming out soon!<br />Now, I know I've been the one to rate movies against what the crowd thinks, but this time it's completely, 100% honest, without a doubt, the bare-bones truth. I hated this movie with a passion, I wish it was never made, I will \\"never ever ever\\" (Taylor Swift quote, from a song that, while not very good, is better than this movie by far, by the way!) let my children watch this movie. Ever. Never ever ever! I see too many little boys walking into public places - McDonalds, WalMart, hospitals, even churches (it's happened) - yelling, like Gru stupidly does in the beginning of this movie \\"Freeze ray! Freeze ray! Freeze ray!\\" and points his fingers at people. Yeah, kid... get a life and watch a GOOD movie for a change, how bout'cha?<br />Despicable Me 2. Truly they are trying to torture us. This is an AVOID movie, with a bad SEQUEL.<br />If you want a GOOD cartoon for kids that has some good humor, see Toy Story, Monsters, Inc (with an actual GOOD sequel coming!), or see 2012's live-action Parental Guidance for family fun. This is trash.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a very good book I can't wait to read catching fire. Better start reading I know it will be great
B005MQW5RI|5.0|I seen this movie after seeing Despicable Me, I think (my brain hasn't been too good since Despicable Me, which lowered my IQ 92 points), and I didn't expect much from Megamind. But it's appropriate humour for families, and it's fun and enjoyable! I laughed harder than anybody in the theaters, and rushed to the store the day this movie was out to get the DVD, and the equally cute (although too short) short Button of Doom. Both were amazing. I highly recommend this movie!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|The book was very good but it seemed to wonder from one subject to the next and sometimes I was lost to where we were in the story.
B007RI56NY|5.0|how nice to get a complete album and with good quality sound no hics and no shopping around at the declining music stores
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I played the free version unt&igrave;l I almost had the patterns memorized. I finally broke down and bought the 99 cent version, and I am so glad I did. Went from 4 sets of I think 12 layouts to 4 sets of 48 layouts! Wonderful!<br /><br />This game: does not penalize for rearranging the tiles<br />  does not reward  you for matching 4 of a kind (2 sets of 2)<br />  most games are winnable (I can clear most screens in under 4 min, now)<br /><br />I use this game as a stress reliever, playing a few screens during class to reduce my urge to fidget<br />I play the game for 20 min or so when I first go to bed, before reading, very relaxing,<br /><br />If you like the free version,you should buy it because just lots more of the same!<br /><br />This game is not for the hardcore Mahjongg player, it is too simple/easy. But for the rerasons I play this game? This game is perfect!!!
B002OR0RP0|5.0|Exciting,  I liked the visuals in this movie and the story, too.  I would order it again.  It was a fun experience.
B00B5AP7NY|2.0|Not a bad movie but this is just the cutscenes from the game repackaged. Was hoping for a new story.
B00AEFYXD6|4.0|Cute movie, creative & entertaining! Loved characters & very colorful! A very must see for all ages!  Was excited to receive it!
0307352153|4.0|We've all heard the old adage \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\" Nowhere is this more appropriate than Susan Cain's Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.  Sporting a watercolored-wash grey cover with the title in red and the subtitle in white, it's not the most attractive book out there. If the publisher was trying to create a book that mimics what most people think of introverts, they've succeeded. Unfortunately, as Susan Cain points out, this impression of introverts--bland, aloof, dull, stuck up or anti-social--is inaccurate. The book cover does more to further introverted stereotypes than it does to change them.<br /> Cain breaks her work down into four parts. The first looks at the \\"introverted ideal\\" in our society and how we have come to embrace the concept that gregarious crowd-pleasing extroverts are more successful in life. The second part dives into the biological components of introversion. The shortest part is the third, which looks at the extroverted ideal in other cultures. Cain spends the last part by offering ways to effectively communicate with--and as--an introvert.<br /> I was overwhelmed by the amount of research the author has put into this work. Every section--every few pages--details professional and scientific research results to back up the author's claims. From professors and medical doctors to students and clients, interviews fully substantiated and support each point. The reader can sometimes feel a bit inundated with reports and data, but this should only serve to highlight the depth and quality of this work. This is perhaps the definitive non-clinical text on the subject.<br /> As an introvert and a pastor, I am all-too-aware of social expectations and assumptions about the extroverted ideal, as well as the lack of understanding many people have about introverts. I found Cain's work to reinforce basic knowledge I already knew about introversion while going far beyond it with new insights, research and detail. I wish Quiet had been written fifteen or twenty years ago so I could have know about introversion then as I do now after reading it.<br /> Don't judge this book by its cover! If you are an introvert, this is one of the best books you will read this year to help you love and claim who you are and how you are wired. If you work with an introvert (and who doesn't?) or are in a relationship with an introvert, take the time to work through this book to gain a better, more thorough understanding of those around you, and the uniqueness they bring to the world.<br />  (I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group; this has not affected the review in any way).

B000O8OTNC|2.0|This knife sharpener will sharpen your knife, but you must be really careful as not to have an accident, and cut the hand (fingers) that hold the body of the knife sharpener, if not super careful it would be easy for the sharpener to slip in your fingers, and cause a painful cut to your hand, or fingers.  Again the knife sharpener will sharpen your knife, but just use caution as to finger placement while sharpening your knife.  Final Note:  &#34;This Knife Sharpener Will Sharpen Your Knife&#34; !

B00AIBZJS4|5.0|Worlds Away is a magnificent Cirque du Soleil composite of Ka, O, and Love (three Cirque shows in Los Vegas) by James Cameron and Andrew Adamson.  It another trip into the magical fantasia, musical, dance world of Cirque du Soleil.  I have loved those I have seen live, and those I have on dvd.  This is a magical kingdom unto itself to be enjoyed and savored as a sweep of wild imagination.  There is a love story here, and it plays louder than usual in a Cirque production.  The artistry, the gymnastics, the athleticism, the scenery, the costumes, the colors swirling are wonderful. The music is marvelous.<br /><br />The cheap circus is played to the hilt in the opening scenes.  Then the magical circus takes over and buries the listener with wave after wave of the magnificent scenes from Ka, O, and Love.  I have only seen one of these, and want to see the other two even more now that I have had a taste of them.  But to enjoy this you have to let your imagination run wild, accepting lots of motion, characters, and superfluous action.  But that is the fun of the Cirque style - Beautiful action and costumes with lots of gymnastics, athleticism, surrounded by swirling music unique to this world. Of course, much of this does not make sense in the usual sense of a movie or even a circus.  You just have to ride with the flow, awed and mesmerized by the wild imaginations that dream this stuff up.<br /><br />I applaud Cirque du Soleil for allowing James Cameron and Andrew Adamson to take scenes from their shows, merge them into another sequence, and make more mystery and magic for those of us that love Cirque.

B00C7L8DM2|4.0|The true star of this better than average espionage thriller is Belgium. Shot in Antwerp and Brussels the cities are extraordinarily beautiful, written by Arash Amel and directed by Philipp St&ouml;lzl - both of whom are young and new to the business and it shows.<br /><br />Ben Logan (Aaron Eckhart in a solid performance) is an ex-CIA agent employed by a huge conglomerate Halgate and working for one of their subsidiary companies as a security engineer. He has invited his daughter Amy (Liana Liberato) to move from the US to Belgium to live with him to reconnect after a lengthy separation. Ben's job is to try to get pass security protocols, fool the eye scanners and break into safes. But overnight Ben discovers that his company, Halgate, no longer inhabits his workplace and that all evidence of Ben's existence has been erased. Slowly he discovers that there is a huge conspiracy surrounding his employer and that soon he and his daughter will become subjects of a manhunt. Ben's co-workers are all murdered with the exception of his colleague Derek Kolper (Neil Napier) who apparently has possession of documents that will bring the conspiracy into the open. Ben relies on his US operative colleague Anna Brandt (the beautiful Ukrainian actress Olga Kurylenko) who is not who she seems. Amy grows from being a dysfunctional disgruntled teenager to a keen `agent' with some help from her boyfriend Nabil (the very bright handsome new rising star Yassine Fadel). Targeted for termination by a company with seemingly unlimited recourses, they only have one choice: get to the bottom of this conspiracy in a hope that it will save their lives.<br /><br />Though there are holes in this story and many borrowed concepts from other films in this genre, the film provides visual if not intellectual excitement. The cast is solid and there is always the magnificent beauty of Belgium to fill in the gaps. Who knows how it will fare when it reaches the theaters, but for now it provides a solid at home evening of entertainment. Grady Harp, April 13evening of entertainment. Grady Harp, April 13

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|My whole family has been playing this game and we love it.  There are a few things that frustrate us though - I offer them as feedback to the developers:<br />1) Sometimes the Code Red play becomes unresponsive on Kindle Fire (both the original and the HD), we push and push and push and the dinosaurs escape.  This never happens when we play on our phones.  Very frustrating!<br />2) The Social features aren't well integrated.  It takes too long for friends to show up in your list.  Gifts and help don't show up in a timely manner.  This should be more real time.<br />3) The interface for sending invites is just a long scrolling list of names, in no dicernable order.  It's hard to find people.  The list should have a search feature and it should be alphabetical.<br />4) The water park and the land park poorly integrated - it feels like playing 2 distinct games.<br />5) Once in a while when you walk away from the game for a few hours, if you don't exit the game or otherwise cause it to save state (such as visiting someone else's park) it looses everything you've done.  Sadness ensues.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, we all love this game - fixing the few things above will make it even better!
B007REV4T8|2.0|\\"Skyfall\\" is the 23rd film in Eon Production's James Bond franchise and the first action film directed by Sam Mendes, whose superb talent for drama is unable to find any foothold in this daft script. The film opens in Instanbul, Turkey, where James Bond (Daniel Craig) has been dispatched to retrieve an errant harddrive containing the identities of all undercover NATO agents embedded in terrorist cells. He fails to do so after a lengthy action sequence in which he pursues a mercenary by the name of Patrice (Ola Rapace). Bond is forced to retire from the Service by a near death experience at the hands of a novice field agent (Naomi Harris) and takes to drinking and popping pills in exotic locales...until the villain behind the harddrive theft blows up MI6's London headquarters and gets free reign of its computer system. A broken Bond springs back into action.<br /><br />Where did this harddrive with the identities of undercover agents come from? Why would such a thing be circulating? And how could anyone decrypt it? Who knows? M (Judi Dench), head of the British Secret Service, is asked to resign over this blunder, but she refuses to leave. And she refuses to recall the agents who have been compromised. Now, at this point, one would expect her to be removed from MI6 at gunpoint and perhaps escorted to the nearest lockup. But M must remain, regardless of gross incompetence and questionable mental health, because the villain, a former MI6 agent calling himself Silva (Javier Bardem), was driven mad by torture and plans to carry out a personal vendetta against M, whom he holds responsible for his own twisted fate. He will do this by hacking MI6's secure computer system, which is apparently not a mainframe.<br /><br />At this point, in walks James Bond, an old, alcoholic, drug-addled, and very neurotic misanthrope in a state of perpetual misery. But Bond has a sentimental attachment to M, who sends him into the field, even though he is mentally unstable, failed every physical and psychiatric test that MI6 could devise, and appears to be suffering from the DTs. \\"Skyfall\\"'s writers seem to have taken a page from \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\". Our superhero is all of a sudden a mental and physical basketcase, but he will inexplicably regain his prowess -and his cartilage- when the time comes to fight the bad guy. Silva looks like Julian Assange doing The Joker, so that wasn't the only Batman movie the writers saw. He's a silver-haired computer hacker and insane agent of chaos who wreaks havoc by posting sensitive information on YouTube. This is supposed to embody contemporary fears?<br /><br />The plot is so ridiculous that it's unwatchable. Explaining how bad it is won't spoil anything. There's nothing to spoil. The conclusions are forgone. The audience will only be surprised at how clumsily the plot points are resolved, when they are resolved at all. It's as if the writers went out of their way to make every scene unbelievable. \\"Skyfall\\"'s themes are even less coherent. There is a confused message about transparency. MI6 fears Silva's forced transparency, but there is a lot of rhetoric about whether the agency can or cannot continue to work \\"in the shadows.\\" MI6 needs transparency, or it doesn't. M fears that the new enemies of the civilized world cannot be identified, but she knew Silva well. He's not mysterious. He's a loon with an axe to grind. It's not clear what the enemy is here, speaking figuratively. Is the enemy transparency, chaos, or the mentally ill?<br /><br />Nostalgia is another major theme, though it's similarly unclear what is being said about it. There is nostalgia for Bond's childhood, for his old Astin Martin, for homemade explosives, for antique shotguns, for gamekeepers, for straight razors, for loyalty, for clarity, for \\"the old ways.\\" M is accused of nostalgia for the Cold War. But MI6 concedes that it cannot fight Silva, who is just one mischievous hacker, on his own ground. The old spy agency can't compete in the high-tech world. It must lure Silva -by means of the most sophisticated technology- into tangibly primitive territory -Scotland- in order to conquer him. Are they kidding? Silva is a joke. No one would be afraid of his antics. But I do get the impression that the writers and producers of \\"Skyfall\\" fear modern technology. They clearly don't understand a thing about it. They want you to think it's spooky.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" did make me nostalgic...for James Bond. What can be said for an action film that has an unappealing protagonist, no sympathetic or compelling characters, lasts 2 hours and 20 minutes, and whose action sequences are so dull that I didn't notice that they were action sequences after the first one? Where is the entertainment value in this film? James Bond was an iconic action hero, because men all wanted to be him and women all wanted to sleep with him. He was a brash, principled, bon vivant. He enjoyed life. And he wanted to accomplish something. Daniel Craig's Bond hates everyone and everything. He vacillates between being sociopathic and cloyingly sentimental. He promises a woman protection, then waits until she is dead to do something about it. He's driven primarily by self-loathing. Why would I want to watch this?igh-tech world.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is one game I actually play daily it need few things to make it good I think it could use buckets, grass, sun, and moon, jungles, different types of wood planks, infinate worlds, and caves and ravines, and redstone, also lava and lapis very rare. other than those few things minecraft pe is better than x box and almost as good as Pc
B009KG7EMC|1.0|Too much blood, violence, explosions .  No plot or purpose to this movie.  I watch movies for some kind of entertainment but this movie has nothing to offer.

0525952926|5.0|I've really enjoyed this series. The global perspective makes it such an interesting read. Sometimes the focus on wars and battles lose me a bit, but then the perspective changes to another character. I am eagerly awaiting the third book.
B008RTE066|5.0|beautiful box set with treasures from the past and the present - i love it!!! and 5 more words required
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I love the build a park games so I was really excited, but it would take for ever to load and not even play the game just a message saying it couldn't play
B005LAJ17M|1.0|The first disc played without any problem. But the second and third discs would not play at all. Too late to return it for a Replacement. Disappointed. The show is terrific.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows.  It just keeps getting better.  I hate waiting for the next week and have to purchase whey episode so I can watch over and over.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Next to the iOS keyboard, this is the most accurate keyboard I have used. The ability to autocorrect multiple words or sentences and the swype-style Flow typing is phenomenal. It also looks pretty great too. For the price it's definitely a good deal and I use this over all other keyboards on my Android phones. It definitely doesn't disappoint.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite series! Can't wait to read the rest! Definitely worth the read! Can't wait to see what happens next in Clary and Jace's misadventures in the world of Shadowhunters.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This is a great looking calculator app that has all the neat functions I could want from a calculator. It can't graph but it has sin and tangent and all that good stuff.  It has enough different themes to suit most people's tastes.

B00133KFGW|5.0|I use this film to illustrate the &#34;gifts&#34; children may have that are not evident. Teachers need to examine their students and notice these gifts and teach through them.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is fun to play with horses. too many money purchase requests. little difficult for 6 year old play.<br />would recommend

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|A fantastic movie by one of our greatest directors.  Five star performances by all actors, except Daniel Day Lewis, I'd give him six!
B00005UWRU|1.0|I bought this DVD in hopes of using it with a group of students. When I tried to show it, it was not able to be shown in the USA-apparently it could only be used in Europe. What a disappointment! It would have been a perfect parallel to the material we had been studying. I threw the DVD out! I did not know who to contact with this problem.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Any fan of RPGs or games like Bejeweled are sure to love this game. The customization is endless and the gameplay never gets old.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|This movie is a great movie to watch with adults.  The music is great! Patrick Swayze knows how to move.  He has great moves.  I highly recommend this movie. I have a DVD at home and now I have it on my iPad.
B000002B35|5.0|I chose this CD because it's a good compilation of good old Pink Floyd originals. I would recommend this to any PF fan! Great double CD set.
B00113N6KQ|5.0|I love this movie cause it's action pack.  It's not a family movie. I know if you buy it you will enjoy it. I got it for my iPad and I also have it here at home.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did not like the way the book ended. It left a person hanging and wondering. The story had a lot of twists and turns in it which was interesting.

B001JI7WTO|5.0|This is a great family movie to see.  I've enjoyed watching it with my family.  I got it for my iPad and also a DVD for my home.
B003RUZKC8|2.0|Just not  good movie. Very predictable. Save your money and rent something else. A few funny moments and some OK special effects.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Now here is a movie that at times it will make you cry and other times it will keep you on the edge.  It's  has a few lessons in life.  It goes to show you believe in Jesus and he will always be there for you threw good and bad times.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I read the Edgar Rice Burroughs series about 50 years ago. At the it was difficult too imagine how someone could do a decent job translating the concept to  film. This film does an excellent job of it. Unfortunately, Jeddak and other terms and concepts don't sound so original when bastardized forms of them were used in Star Wars and Avatar. Both films borrowed heavily from Burroughs 1911 book and it's 10 sequels. To anyone unfamiliar with the original works, the Carter movie probably looks like the \\"rip off\\".I'd recommend reading the 2 original books, then watch the movie, then read the \\"novelization, then watch Luke Skywalker and Avatar. If you take notes, it could be the basis for an interesting doctoral thesis.<br />Buy John Carter and watch it on a regular basis.
B000I9YWN4|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this movie.  I've enjoyed Queen Latifa's acting in this movie.  I have this movie on my iPad and I have it on video tape.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.<br />Very similiar circumstances happened to my son in law, he saw and felt the same things. I found it to be comforting. More and more in our times we need to be reminded there is a God who loves us.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|My whole family can't wait till Sunday nights to see the walking dead.  I got this season on my iPad but I will have to wait to buy it for my DVD player.  I know my friends r clued to their TV set watching it every Sunday when it's on.  We all watch the repeats.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Other folks have described this game better than I could, and anything I said would just be repeating their praise.  I would just add this:  Not only do I have this game, ALL the expansions and the travel version, but I now buy copies of the base game (like I did in this case) for friends who I visit and enjoy the travel version (which I bring with me everywhere).<br />So basically I buy this game and pass it out to people... I don't know how to give the game higher praise.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I know a lot of our friends see this movie every Sunday when it's on.  My family loves it.  I had to buy  seasons 1, 2 and 3 cause when the season ends at lease I can watch it from the beginning. I highly recommend all the seasons. Can't wait to get season 4 on my iPad.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|wow! great grafics, good play time, excellent games. G5 has a lot of good games and this one doesn't dissapoint. love the sales... I bought all seven for a buck each! only one so far that was just too easy, but still loads of fun. keep it up G5!
B003TNM2ME|5.0|This movie is a sci-fi movie that my family have really like watching over and over again. I have it on my iPad and I also have the DVD movie.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is just what the doctor ordered<br />Small enough to keep it with me at all times but big enough to notice if I lose it
B008HB34I4|5.0|You will not be sorry if you buy this movie. You will get to see what Jesus went threw for all our sins.
076115678X|5.0|I had the previous book and I like this one better. It has more useful info for me, including curly hair types and washing and conditioning  procedures and the pictures are very helpful too. Good book, good buy!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|This is the second book I have read by Richard Castle. I like how he ties the characters together from one book to the next.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great reading!  Now time for the movie. Hopefully the movie will be as good as the book.  Nicolas Sparks is awesome.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy playing this. its good to keep my mind off of things and keeps my hands busy. I love it
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I really love this app! it is so much better than the regular Facebook app it gives you most recent status updates it is much faster also  !
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great family fun game.  This helps teach our children patience, planning & gives them creativity designing & breeding new types of dragons.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It keep thing  the kids busy. It also help them learn how to take care of pets.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson movies, especially The Royal Tenenbaums. I think if you don't like that, you should probably read no further. This movie has a lot of really bizarre twists & turns (and scenes/shot where you think - &#34;What did I just miss?&#34;) that you'll see in Wes Anderson's other movies.<br />The story is just cute & hard not to like: two 12- or 13-year old pen pals run off together. The boy is a &#34;Khaki Scout&#34; who is excessively earnest and the girl is a troubled & maybe a little violent. Makes for hilarious goings on.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like to be able to play however when I can no longer play then I do not plan on spending money to do so<br />would at least have a daily allowance given free to play daily<br />Thank You
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is very addicting for children like me. You can compete with your friends and also get friends and visit them and help with their horses. Free gems come in handy:)
B0034DGPEU|2.0|While the beginning of the book was very dramatic and captivating, the further into the book you went it got more and more morbid. I finally stopped reading when the next bad event to happen was a crime against a woman and those tale I just cannot bear.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this story.  You can't help falling in love with sweet Jaime.  Humorous,  sad and every emotion in between.
B003F1WM2K|4.0|This is a well written and moving account. It evokes the sixties, an era I lived through also, and represents it with respect but no nostalgia. Exactly right. The perspective is at times external when I might have liked more cutting insight, less of who wore what and more insight into the pervasive spirit of rebellion.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. All the actors do amazing work in this beautiful movie.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I know, it was FREE. It plays OK, but I can normally win a higher percentage of games with other (Windows) similar programs.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this app a lot. It is definitely a game that I understand. Not like some of the other apps. But I do recommend getting this game. Solitaire is a game for everyone. I personally LOVE IT!!!!!!
B000YRY8BG|5.0|This is a review of the mini-series and may contain SPOILERS!!<br /><br />This thriller is well done in every aspect, great writing and acting, taut direction with a gritty feel and frenetic pacing resulting in a teleplay that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout and felt very realistic to me.  Although there were a few niggling details that, upon reflection, might have been somewhat at odds with the final resolution, on the whole I thought the exposition of the numerous characters and the ingredients necessary to build the intrigue, mystery and suspense through the 6 hour story was masterfully done.  And, like many thrillers of this genre, not every little detail is wrapped up neatly with a bow by the end, leaving several areas for interesting discussions among the thoughtful, analytic viewers.  I thought this series was a very interesting, satisfying and compelling way to spend 6 hours.<br /><br />I watched 3 episodes one night and the final three the next since I got one disc at a time from Netflix.  If I had purchased the dvd set or if it had been available on a streaming service I probably would have watched all 6 episodes in one night so plan accordingly.<br /><br />My biggest question concerning this story is how anyone thought they could squeeze this 6 hour mini-series into a 2 hour movie.  If you want to see a study in contrasts, watch the movie first, then the series.  I'll bet you'll develop an even stronger appreciation for the quality of the series and the impossible task faced by the writers and director of the movie and how they decided to go about it.
B00A83075M|5.0|I gave this a 5 star rating because my son absolutely loves this movie. I bought it for him for Easter because he really loves Disney movies. I would recommend this to any who likes Disney movies. Its another great hit.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is a lot like mafia wars as in you have to wait for more power to play. Also it takes way to long to get diamonds and you need a lot of them.
B003PIUBZS|3.0|I got this item because I am a professor of Roman history, so I obviously find Roman stuff interesting.<br /><br />I wish that I'd looked a little closer before ordering. I didn't expect that the series would include graphic nudity. That's not really my thing.<br /><br />In addition, the Romans weren't as sex-crazed as cable TV makes them out to be.
B00BESM14U|1.0|The decision is in.  The public is determined to rave about this movie.  Perhaps because it offers the appealing idea that everyone who went through high school outside of the \\"cool kid\\" group was actually super special in their own way and it was the world's fault, or perhaps a molesting aunt's fault, that they were having difficulty in some way.  It does not seem to matter that these self-described \\"misfit toys\\" actually had a veritable mansion with a six-car garage with which to have these great parties.  It does not matter that these misfits were hailed as the star cast of Rocky Horror Picture Shows live theatrical sing-a-along, performed at a Broadway level of expertise to a packed house that loved them.  Yes, these are the poor down-and-out kids of the time.  Did I mention that they are all attractive as well as talented?  These poor, poor kids, having such a hard time out of life.  But the let-us-Americans-feel-sorry-for-ourselves theme of the movie is the only realistic thing about it.  Emma Watson, playing a wizened senior dating college men, looks the same age as the young freshman.  So the dialogue of an experienced woman (\\"I want to make sure that the first person you kiss is someone who loves you\\") just doesn't feel right.  Have the filmmakers seen what a freshman looks like and the difference between freshman and seniors?  The film is this unrealistic throughout the movie.  Poor Emma, a beautiful young girl with the grades to go to Penn State, an Ivy League school, has self-esteem issues.  Can I get into Penn State.  Well, obviously you have the grades to go to college.  So get over whether you are making it to the ivy league.  Their leader, again wealthy and talented, must endure the tragedy of being in love with the gay quarterback (the gay quarterback is actually a cliche in such \\"quirky\\" movies).  And both tragedies are explained (twice just so you can tell your friends about the incredibly deep theme of the movie) by: \\"We only accept the love we think we deserve.\\"  Such deep wisdom is appropriate for the Jerry Springer show, but couldn't we have just a little bit more here.  Well, perhaps we only get the movies we think we deserve.  In which case, we apparently don't think we deserve much.  But I don't think that I deserved this painful two hours and if you have any self-esteem, perhaps you will save yourself such pain.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I had a hard time getting into this film when I first saw it, after I watched it again and I could see that it was a great picture.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing, dark, and delicious read. It's not what you expect and it keeps you on your toes. Phenomenal love story.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I've been playing Free Cell on my computer for years--or is it decades?--but try not to spend too much time on it.  Now I have a new time-waster on my Fire.  Good for those short waits when you don't want to start a book or connect to the internet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers rocks.I love<br />it and so will u.<br />I bet no one can beat my highscore 50000. If anyone does put a reveiw up for me.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|The acting and singing in this movie was extraordinary. Even the weaker singers did a good job. However, this version seemed to drag on more than other versions I've seen. I would watch it again, but probably with coffee or an energy drink in hand.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|I've been playing Halo since the Second game came out and I have been obsessed with the story since then. I was extremly excited for this when I first heard about it, me being a long term fan, and I was very happy when these came out online. I think you can only watch the first two episodes on YouTube now but if you're interested in this go watch them and see if you like it then come back here to buy it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Good book for fans of the Percy Jackson series and Greek and Roman mythology. I really liked it and is really cool
B0079R8IYW|5.0|It came really fast and was very inexpensive but is a good quality product. I'm very happy with my purchase.
0312323867|3.0|I really enjoyed something \\"Something Borrowed\\".  I read the book before I saw the movie and a friend of mine said \\"They really portrayed Darcy horribly in the movie, she wasn't THAT bad.\\"  Well, after I read the book, I didn't see how the movie could've made her much worse.  I didn't like her in the first book and unfortunately, the author didn't turn that around for me in Something Blue.  Even with having Darcy's perspective and witnessing her transformation, I found it very difficult to root for her.  I think I would've respected her journey more had she and Ethan remained friends and if she'd truly found her own way without looking for someone to take of her.  She eventually got herself together but it was too little too late for me.  I enjoy Emily Giffin's work, she's generally great at helping us understand the motivations of her characters but I guess I still haven't forgiven Darcy for her \\"Something Borrowed\\" shenanigans!
B0006IEVFG|3.0|Mnetionned that the watch can't hold time.Casio is an old cie in the business could solve that problem. Hard to understand the fonctions of the watch.I had a problem setting the alarm.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was worth buying I got it cause my cousin goes to college in Ashville and there is a lot of Griffty
031237593X|3.0|I *love* Penman's more recent books so I decided to read this one, her very first. Honestly, it is not up to the standard of the newer ones.<br /><br />It's like she could not decide whether it would be a romance book or an adventure book. All her books have some romance but not to the extent of this one re: Anne and Richard. For example, I only scanned a lot of the pages about how she is treated, has to hide out, and eventually finds Richard. Seemed kind of contrived.<br /><br />I really prefer Penman books that are better at combining relationships and adventures. If you like this book, you will **LOVE** books such as her Welsh Princes series: Here Be Dragons (1985) ·Falls The Shadow (1988) ·The Reckoning (1991). (I would rate these 4.5 to 5 stars each ... very long too but I read every page thoroughly and was sorry when the series was done.)<br /><br />Almost though not quite as enjoyable as the Welsh series is the  The Plantagenet series When Christ and His Saints Slept (1995) ·Time and Chance (2002) ·Devil's Brood (2008) ·Lionheart (2011) Of these I enjoyed Lionheart the most and really hope there will be another Penman book soon.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Definitely a great take on a Galaga/Space Invaders retro remake. Keep up the good work, and I'll be sure to play them! =3

B0033807C2|5.0|Love love LOVED the last Olympian. Was the perfect end to the action filled series by Rick Riordan.<br />The battle between Kronos (luke) and Percy was amazing and the romantic ending will annabeth was a nice way to pull away for the action.<br />All in all amazing! Loved the series and can't wait to read more from Rick Riordan :)
B004TI5N38|5.0|I love the Puller character and truly hope Baldacci writes more books around him.  Also love Baldacci's attention to detail without making it boring in the least.
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|I love Adam Lambert and consider myself a &#34;glambert&#34; (fan). I think his voice comes along once in a lifetime. Not only that but his technical knowledge of musical technique is truly impressive. He knows his chords, his timing, how to &#34;place&#34; his voice for maximum effect, how to do those incredible runs. The thing I don't like about this CD is that it's so much &#34;look at me.&#34; It's like he's saying, &#34;This is me partying,&#34; &#34;this is me being introspective,&#34; &#34;this is my social-action perspective ... &#34; I didn't feel a connection although I understand what he was trying to do. The music itself is great, not as over-produced at his debut album, &#34;For Your Entertainment.&#34; He seems to have calmed down and the music is richer. I just felt left out.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This album is great. It has sad songs, happy songs, catchy songs. The sound is a little more pop-y than their previous albums. On this album Closer, Now I'm All Messed Up, Shock to Your System, Drove Me Wild are my favorites, but the whole album is enjoyable.  Highly recommend!
1419705849|5.0|My 6 year old grandson loves this whole series.<br />I have heard all about each one he has read.<br />Great messages.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie! Ben did a great job. Keeps you interested, has good dialog, and I would recommend this for kids 14 and up.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I enjoy the opportunity to play along with people from all walks of life. The game is easy to play and I like the characters in the game.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Couldn't get it to shut off, couldn't delete or change alarms.  I found it frustrating to use from the start so I uninstalled it and currently use the default alarm clock, which is not reliable.  The search is on.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a great book. It really made me think of what August was thinking as he walked around town and how hard life can be. I would recommend<br /> this book to ages 9-15 but adults can defiantly enjoy it too.
B00C1E8E7E|4.0|Seems like he stepped up his game, some tracks will make u laugh and some will get u turnt up like trashwang even tho its a simple track, he reminds me of eminem back in the day
B009RX7WTI|4.0|I have not received this yet.  Season eight was good and involved all of them about the same amounty of camera time.  WHy is it that each season has to end with a terrible tragidy?  How about another type of cliff hanger, romance or job suspension.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|this was a very sweet, cute movie about jack, a loner who longs to understand his purpose and his journey to discovering himself.  something about him i was able to connect with and drew me into the movie even though its not as context rich as some other animated films, it still carries a beautiful message that children can easily understand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is just simply amazing! Once I start I can't put it down!!!!!:):):) I really love the World Tour idea!
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|I only wish I had done ANYTHING else on a Saturday night. Laundry...algebra...putting my dog to sleep all of these options would have had more joy than this movie. By far the worse flick I have seen in a long time, maybe ever. I believe I just watched a suicide note. Avoid this at all costs!
B00425S1H8|2.0|My application for this cable was to connect an X10 CM11A to a Raspberry Pi. It didn't work at all - characters were received but they were jumbled, out of order. I got this particular brand (Plugable) because Prolific (the chip maker) recommended them. Maybe it works for some applications, but not mine so I returned it for a refund. I ended up using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO port Tx and Rx lines with a TTL to RS232 inverter/level shifter - a little more work, but it actually works.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|You know sometimes when you finish a really good series you get that kind of sad, depressed feeling knowing that its all over? Well, thats how I felt about this book. It was a great end to the series and definetely worth the read. Overall I think this was an excellent  end to the series, with plenty of action, but maybe not as much as the first two. I was kept guessing until the very end, since there were so many twists in the plot. This an amazing series, and I can't wait for the film adaption coming out February 14, 2014.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Definitely recommend it for a good evening's entertainment.  I'd like to know how accurate it is, but good to watch anyway.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I picked this game out for my Mother.  She is 83 and she wants to keep her mind active as well as challenged.  She text emails has learner to use a smartphone and enjoys her kindle fire!  This game helps to keep her mind young and alert!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter loves playing the game.  She does chores just so  she can play it more .  The graphics are great and it it easy to navigate.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|I watched the entire series over again and was not disappointed.  Still can't believe a season 4 wasn't created but I am looking forward to the new project.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I LOVE THE PENDERGAST SERIES. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE. PRESTON AND CHILD ARE GREAT WRITERS INDIVIDUALLY AND FANTASTIC TOGETHER.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I have been using this app for a few years and it was great.  With this new update all I get are lockups and application not responding messages. I think the app is trying to do too much.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I started because of a 25 year old, and it's quite interesting.I've already told others about it. It's incredible to think of how many different points of view there are.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|The book was to slow, to much detail and was hard to get into to it.  I finished reading it and I really like Kay Scarpetta.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The audio was weird at the beginning I had too restart it a couple of times.Its a very suspenseful<br />movie and directed.
B009GED3HS|4.0|As the years go on, this show seems to be getting a little more bizarre and far fetched and less focused on the individual humor of the characters, but, I am still a loyal fan.  Though it's no longer the first show I feel the need to watch when I sit down on a Tuesday to catch up from the night before, I still enjoy and will continue to watch until the day we finally find out who the mother is.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Such a wonderful movie! Great for all ages.<br /><br />Has a lot of cool bonus features too for those who love to see how it was all brought together!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Thought Season 3 was &#34;okay.&#34;  I really enjoyed the first two seasons of the show but I found this season to be a little boring.  The first half of season 3 was pretty decent, but the first several episodes of the second half were terrible in my opinion - there was a lack of dialogue, the plot seemed predictable, and just didn't care as much for the whole &#34;governor&#34; plot.  Just got very tired...didn't seem like anything was happening for a few episodes in a row.  Not willing to abandon the series just yet, but this season made me question whether or not this show will continue to be one worth paying for.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Mahjong is one of the easiest games I've ever played, and I'm under 13. You just match 2 tiles together, and if it won't work, try another pair!<br /><br />I get how the people who rated this app 1 star say it crashes. I have that problem with Smule Magic Piano, but this app is fine.<br /><br />Some people who rated this app 1 star says it's boring and hard. It's not really hard. But as my title says, use the beta preview BEFORE installing.<br /><br />I hope this review helped you.
B000002B35|5.0|Love This CD.I bought it because I had the Video of this Pink Floyd concert and found a few more song's I never heard.I am very pleased with this CD.Very pleased to be able to purchase so many CDS through Amazon.Thank you.
B00127RAJY|5.0|did these workouts and rest for a month and definitely are wonderful. It is best if you do only one level, you feel much better when finished. Well .... do all three together is wonderful. The stress goes away when you finish doing all three workouts together. I liked it too, because this video could develop physical condition to withstand without any problems the exercises on the DVD of \\"6 weeks 6 pack abs\\".<br />Even now I can combine both DVDs and end up feeling good about myself and without much physical pain
B000002GVO|3.0|Not many songs on here that I like but love Don Henly and The Eagles.Beautiful song on this CD called Wasted Time.Thank you.
B00BESM14U|1.0|We turned it off after seeing a scene with two guys making out... if that is not your thing, you probably don't want to watch this movie. Wish there had been a warning about that somewhere before we paid $4 to rent it. O'well. Probably should have known better and done better research.
1439193630|5.0|This book has inspired and pushed me. Whether you are a writer or not, this book is enjoyable. I recommend it to anyone interested in reading. This is one of the greats!
B0063M22QO|3.0|This is a bit better than the others I have tried I hope it doesn't get boring too soon will see
0205313426|5.0|The Elements of Style is simply a must for any aspiring writer. It is my number one go to reference book.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I wanted badly to give the trilogy 5 stars, but I can't.  The first two books were wonderful, easily 5 stars (The Hunger Games book One especially.  Mockingjay, the third and final book in the series not so much.  I love the detail that Collins put forth in all three books.  I could visually see the story playing out in my head as I read every line.  My biggest complaint about the trilogy is the ending.  Collins took so much time explaining every detail throughout the series that the reader could follow and truly understand what was going on.  The end just seemed so rushed and disjoint from the rest of the book and the previous two.  She does tie up loose ends about each character, I really was hoping for more details about three of the main characters; Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. I really wanted to hear about how they got to the places that they did.  Not just a couple of lines saying where they were at.  Throughout a three books there was this huge climax building just to fizzle out in the end.  Overall I loved reading The Hunger Games, could hardly put it down.  Definitely would recommend this to anyone!!!
0810989956|5.0|This in exacly what we ordered my grandaughter is very excited to start the series. We will order more of the series in the future.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book gives you excitement at every turn and always keeps you guessing. Rick Riordan really knows how to keel readers always thinking ahead.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|A must see for anyone who is married and/or over 35 yrs. Old. My husband and I laughed until we cried! Definitely worth watching!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Usually apps get boring after awhile, but this app I can go back to and play for hours!!! Love this app!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wonderful! Even got my hubby reading these. They're the perfect way to describe what I've been wanting but unable to put to words. Way to go!
030758836X|2.0|This book was recommended to me by five people...most of whom know I love most of Tana French's work madly. So I was really looking forward to it and was totally and completely disappointed. Good writer, interesting idea, but who the heck does one care about? Or root for? And, after murder and character weakness and twists of plot and leaps of faith poorly rewarded, I was mostly left wondering just why Ms. Flynn wrote this story? I just didn't get the point, and frankly found it in all ways unbelievable and unsatisfying that two such dingbat maniacs ended up together. If one is looking for DuMurier's pessimism but total character believability, or for French's natural and realistic complexity of good and bad in each of us, don't look here.
B00A83075M|2.0|First, I want to say that  the &#34;Paperman&#34; short and featured title are just an irresistible package.  While I was able to view the short uninterrupted and in its entirety, the same can not be said of &#34;Wreck-It Ralph&#34;.  I've rented the DVD twice before purchase, both from a Red Box and it keeps skipping over the same parts throughout the movie.  At first, I blamed the condition of those public rental disc but when I received the brand new DVD from Disney, it skips at the same spots as well.<br /><br />I am sick and tired of companies like Disney and Sony encoding their discs with extra measure stuff (and/or using cheap quality products).  Why use DRM on stuff when it's only punishing the consumers who actually buy the products.  Disney's FastPlay feature is a misnomered and deceptive option to fool you into watching the marketing stuff before getting to the main menu.<br /><br />Granted it seems to be only happening on my computer, which I now use to watch all my movies, but my computer is only two years old and was installed with quality components.  Also, this doesn't happen to the majority of my other DVD's that I own or have rented, so why should it only happen for certain products from certain companies?<br /><br />I'm debating going through the hassle of returning this product since I used the Super Savings option for free shipping, which would obviously be charged for a return.  In short, I like the animated short and movie, but hate the disc features.
B0067R0APK|3.0|Page to busy, to small forecast area. I like the original free version better.<br />Also why did my original suddenly update to this version??
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love the show and sometimes miss it while vacationing.  Would like to get seasons 3 and 4 can you help.
B005YVTHT0|3.0|This is a quality built wheel that offers many hours of fun. The only drawback is a person just getting into this type of gaming has a horrible time figuring out all the inns and outs of the games and wheel operation. There is absolutely no worthwhile / informative instructions that come with the wheel. Nor any worthwhile / informative instructions to be found on there web site. If your new at this like I am, you are made to feel like your illiterate when trying to use there help forum, to ask basic questions about how the wheel and site works. To bad because there is the possibility of many hours of fun, but you have to know how it all works beforehand or your plain out of luck. I'm seriously considering returning my wheel because of the lack of support, and the problems trying to use the different menu's on there site.
B00002SSRZ|5.0|I have the remastered CD which has more bass, but not much detail and separation compared to the DTS version. When played with trinnov optimizer capable system the DTS version blows away the CD, if I want more bass I'll just crank up my Epik sub. Glad I got it.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Steven Wilson does it again. Seems like whether he is playing in his own bands, or writing and playing in other bands, mixing, producing, everything the \\"King Of The 5.1 mix\\" turns to \\"a orgasm of the ear and mind\\". The band he has assembled for this album is so tight and listening to TRTRTS is like a guided tour of the history of progressive music. You'll hear influences from band you love in the past plus Wilson's own signature sound. A must have in anyones prog collection!!!
B00BHMF578|5.0|This pic was much better than we thought it might be. Really held ones attention to detail and naticipati9on of the next move. I remembered those days vaguely but with each scene it brought back memories. The latter scene upon their departure from the airport until the plane was airborne was tense and really exciting. Good movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun to play trying to beat your friends scores :)I like the boards I like the characters which is Frank<br />=)
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I liked everything about this series. No one can touch the quality as much as PBS can. Get all 3 seasons because getting hooked is what all this poppycock is about.<br />Picture quality and extra's you get with this disc set are worth every penny. (never mind all those cheapo's) This is hands down the best TV enjoyment I've had since Dallas.<br />This series will put you in a time warp back to times so much different than today. S2 taught me what it was like in WW1 England. I call this VERY educating.<br />What you will call it will be nothing negative. Trust me.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is ok. But some times it gets bordeing because u do the something over and over....mix it up a little.... I mean put some mountain,rock's,animals that u need to get around put some of those things in there..Make it adventurous....Make it work on all devices...That's what I would like to see in the next Subway Surfers...<br /><br />  LOVE ROCHELLE POWELL

B00992CF6W|4.0|Very fun.. But it has no multiplayer or game enter so I can only play with my friends if their right NEXT to me.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Overall nicely plotted to maintain riveting suspense. Something different in the sci fi genre to do a realistic disaster on a credible (might be tomorrow) Mars mission.
B00ANGICRE|5.0|I HELD VERY NARROW EXPECTATIONS THAT I WOULD ENJOY THIS MOVIE. I WAS VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WHEN I WATCHED THE MOVIE. IT WAS CAPTIVATING FROM START TO FINISH AND I WAS AMAZED HAD HOW WELL THE DIRECTOR HANDLED THE HUMANITY IN THE MOVIE, EVEN TO THE END.<br />YOU WILL NEVER LOOK AT THE PROFESSION THE SAME WAY AGAIN AND YOU WILL BE EMOTIONALLY SWAYED BY THE GOOD THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE SERVICE.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I debated over three stars or four. When I give a book four stars, that means I may read it again someday. I'll never read this book again, it was too painful. I sincerely felt the horror of what was happening to Alice without the benefit of months and years to deal with it a piece at a time. As the reader, I had to take it all in and live it in just a few hours. Traumatic doesn't begin to describe the experience. I feel emotionally wasted.<br /><br />The story the author told was excellent. Could her writing be tighter? Sure. But she put me firmly inside Alice's head and I stayed there. I lived thru the horror of watching yourself forget who you are, why you are who you are, and who the people you love are.<br /><br />The author could have given us a loving 100% supportive family, all rallying round and doing the utmost. She didn't do that, she gave us reality. She gave us a diverse family going different directions with different priorities. The road she took with the husband was especially difficult, perhaps painful because I could see it happening Just. Like. That.<br /><br />I don't think this is a spoiler when I say there's no happy ending for this book. That's the reality for Alzheimer's patients today. No going back. The bit of the story that most resonated with me and brought it home was when Alice wished she had cancer instead. Because cancer she could fight. Cancer brought people to you to help support you. She clearly recognized the difference in how her community responded to Alzheimer's vs cancer, and nailed it. How many different ways are there for us to help cure cancer?  And many forms of cancer are curable. Now, how many ways are there to provide funds to help cure Alzheimer's?  There is no cure. To my knowledge there is no bracelet. It's scary as heck.<br /><br />Sad but important story to force me to think about something I need to think about. Kudos.<br /><br />Update:  I was incorrect - there are fundraising bracelets for Alzheimer's awareness. A quick Internet search will lead you right to them.A quick Internet search will lead you right to them.
1400069742|5.0|Lynne Olson adds another superb volume to her series on how the Western democracies came to grips with the decision for war in the late 1930's and early 1940's.  This volume is as worth reading as the earlier books, though her interpretation here of Roosevelt's course in preparing the country for war might be more debatable.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004KAB4BU Troublesome Young Men: The Rebels Who Brought Churchill to Power and Helped Save England]], the first volume in this informal trilogy, described the struggle within Britain's Conservative party over the issue of appeasement and the eventual triumph of those recognizing the need for all-out resistance to German aggression, with the dramatic repudiation of Neville Chamberlain's leadership in the May 1940 Parliamentary debate over Britain's failure to resist the Nazis in Norway even as the Germans launched the invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands that would lead to the French collapse the following month (John Lukacs' [[ASIN:0300084668 Five Days in London: May 1940]] provides an excellent complement to Olson's account with its inside story of the debate inside the new Churchill government about the possibility of initiating truce talks with the Germans).  Then, [[ASIN:0812979354 Citizens of London: The Americans Who Stood with Britain in Its Darkest, Finest Hour]] described the actions of those Americans who recognized early on the need for U.S. involvement in supporting Britain's fight, and the role they continued to play in supporting the U.S./British alliance through the war and in its immediate aftermath.<br /><br />Those Angry Days now brings the story back home, and recounts the sharp and increasingly acrimonious debate inside the United States about the many steps taken during 1939, 1940 and 1941 that gradually edged the U.S. closer and closer to the Allied cause in resisting the Germans.  As with her earlier books, Those Angry Days is a real page-turner, almost novelistic in its depiction of the bitter fightbetween the interventionist and isolationist camps and the many motivations the partisans in each camp brought to their perspective.<br /><br />Those Angry Days also shares the earlier books' strength as Olson surrounds her depiction of the well-known political leaders with a gallery of portraits of lesser-known figures and the often-critical roles they played in the debate.  She highlights the importance and truly inspiring statesmanship of Wendell Willkie, the Republican nominee against Roosevelt in 1940, who refused to make a political issue of the several critical initiatives (Lend Lease, the implementation of a peace-time draft) taken by the Roosevelt administration during the year to support Britain and strengthen U.S. military capabilities - had Willkie chosen to make political hay of these initiatives, U.S. efforts to prepare for war might have become even more delayed, which would have had disastrous results after Pearl Harbor.  Willkie comes across as a truly impressive figure, with an ability to put national interest above party in a way we'd all like to see emulated today.<br /><br />Olson's depiction of the many figures supporting the isolationist cause also is fair and well-rounded.  She offers a good portrait of Senator Burton Wheeler, the inspiration for the Jimmy Stewart character in [[ASIN:B002VZNZD6 Mr. Smith Goes To Washington]], and other figures in the Senate and the House who resisted Lend Lease and other Administration initiatives for a variety of motives, but especially out of opposition to what they saw as Roosevelt's lust for power.  Her descriptions of Charles Lindbergh, his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, and her family (most of whom were strong supporters of the interventionist side and opponents to Lindbergh's position, to Anne's great discomfort) again offer well-rounded depictions of these key figures, with balanced assessments of what motivated and drove them (and the lingering after-effects of their actions, with one of Lindbergh's daughters recounting how, well after the war, college acquaintances refused to meet her father).  Though I do think Olson portrays him fairly, Lindbergh comes across as a strange, very self-contained man, marching to the beat of his own drummer no matter what his wife or others counseled, with those character traits playing out after the war in his fathering of several secret families in Germany, only revealed after his death.<br /><br />My one quarrel would be with Olson's depiction of FDR himself.  She characterizes him as deeply wounded by his political losses in his second term, with the repudiation of the court-packing scheme (led by Wheeler and others who would become isolationist stalwarts) and the failure of his attempt to defeat key Congressional opponents in the 1938 midterm elections leading Roosevelt, in Olson's view, to a hyper-cautious approach to responding to the German attacks and the British need for aid and support.  In Olson's portrait Roosevelt is a very reluctant interventionist, time and again saying the right things but failing to take action to give practical effect to his supportive words - Lend Lease was great in concept, for example, but the follow-through to put the U.S. economy on a war footing to meet the overwhelming demand for resources to be \\"lent\\" didn't happen for many months after passage of the required legislation.  Others (see Ian Kershaw's [[ASIN:0143113720 Fateful Choices: Ten Decisions That Changed the World, 1940-1941]] as an example) depict a much more purposeful Roosevelt, who had throughout a clear sense of where he needed to direct the country but tailored his actions to reflect the political realities of a population and a Congressional leadership that still sought to minimize the need for direct U.S. intervention.  Olson overdoes her depiction of Roosevelt's hesitancy, I think, though it isn't a flaw that detracts significantly from the overall excellence of the book.<br /><br />Though all three of these books are wellworth reading, I think I'd rank this the third.  [[ASIN:B004KAB4BU Troublesome Young Men: The Rebels Who Brought Churchill to Power and Helped Save England]] is almost novelistic in its flow, with the enormous suspense about the outcome of the debates on Norway (that climaxed in Chamberlain's resignation, clearing the way for Churchill) providing a \\"slam bang\\" ending.  [[ASIN:0812979354 Citizens of London: The Americans Who Stood with Britain in Its Darkest, Finest Hour]] is totally absorbing, with such a full depiction of the lives of Americans in London during the war and the roles of John \\"Gil\\" Winant and Averell Harriman in supporting the war effort (Winant is such an impressive and tragic figure).  The story in Those Angry Days may just be a bit more widely known, so it's perhaps a half-notch down - in comparison to the two others - in its interest.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I picked this game up yesterday and I can't put it down. I've almost got it beat and am having a blast. This is a challenging form of match-three type of games. The sound is relaxing and the graphics are beautiful! Certainly worth three dollars (current going price). What seems to make this different from other match-threes is that you need to work things down to the bottom of the playing board. Easy enough? Well, there are enough obstacles in the way to make this really challenging on a lot of levels. Especially trying to accomplish this with three-star ratings (there is a timer and the faster you get 'er done, the higher your rating will be). Fun! And extremely addictive. Pardon me as I go and finish this game...
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|It is an OK movie.  The action is pretty good at times and the characters are interesting enough.  It is a good movie to watch if you like a little bit of action but it' s not the sort of movie you'd run out to pay $11.00 per ticket to see at the movie theatre.  It's just OK.
1476719071|5.0|The love story here was amazing definitely got me from the beginning...I love me Travis & Abby Maddox. The connection they have to each other is amazing
1400069742|5.0|War is an expensive business.<br /><br />The British found that out in 1939-1941 when they fought the Nazis. They needed plenty of weapons, but the cost of obtaining them from the US pretty much bankrupted the country.<br /><br />What's lesser known is that the German economy in 1939 was on the brink of collapse, and only the invasion of Poland with its raw materials and gold kept the Nazis going.<br /><br />In the U.S.A., there was a huge debate going on about whether the country should be involved. This book is a history of that time. We learn that Roosevelt as president favored the British, and helped them in many ways that the US public was not informed about. But at the same time, he didn't introduce measures that opinion polls said were supported by a majority of Americans. He would sometimes wait for weeks before acting on a subject.<br /><br />Against him was a large amount of Americans, who were still angry about the U.S. involvement in World War One. Their early figurehead was Charles Lindbergh, who was one of the most famous men at that time. Revered as a hero for being the first person to make a solo flight across the Atlantic, he took trips to pre-war Germany and publicly admired their efficiency, to the extent that he was awarded a medal by the Nazis.<br /><br />Lindbergh \\"told it like he saw it,\\" to the degree that he appeared to be an apologist for the Nazis. Unlike FDR, who had an opposition to contend with, Lindbergh could speak his mind without consulting anyone about the ramifications of his speeches. And this is exactly what Lindbergh did, often stirring up trouble over one or two words in his speeches which could have been avoided by consulting with someone skilled in public relations. Even his wife, Anne, was unable to get him to tone down his rhetoric, correctly predicting the anger that would ensue.<br /><br />The interventionists believed that America would be sucked into the war, and that help for Britain would delay that moment. There were still plenty of Democrats who would not support FDR, and help came from an unexpected source - the man that Roosevelt defeated in the previous Presidential election, Republican Wendell Wilkie. Wilkie supported FDR's interventionist approach, and worked hard to achieve it. Although the Germans had influential allies in the U.S. military, the British made a huge effort to sway Americans' opinions towards them.<br /><br />There were many shades of attitude in America - politicians, individuals, and pro- and anti-war groups. I'd never heard of the Century Group until this book, but they were an interventionist group with many famous people involved.

B0036R92V2|2.0|Blue Underground, god bless 'em, disappoint again with their blu-ray line, this time it's the 1966 Sergio Corbucci/Franco Nero spaghetti western classic Django. I don't know what they're seeing on their monitors at BU HQ, but this hi-def presentation is literally ruined by a thick, grimy layer of digital distortion and noise all the way thru. Go back, read that sentence again. I've tried to watch this thing five or six times and just give up around the 15 or 20 min mark everytime. And yes, I've checked later chapters, and the image never improves. After viewing the last Django BU DVD release - which I recommend btw (see, I'm NOT a Blue Underground hater), I'd say that the problem may well lie (is that correct grammar?) with the film elements themselves. Some movies just weren't meant to be seen in the over-cranked blu format...or maybe it's the mastering equipment...I dunno. All I can say is that I wanted to fall in love with this disc and...I just can't. No quibs with the actual film itself. Stone classic. And maybe I'm expecting too much - nah! This disc falls flat on every level. If you've seen the Tarantino tribute film thingy, you know how good the theme song can sound. The sound on this disc is \\"true to original\\" but it's still mono, flat and slightly distorted. I know, I know - that's the way it was supposed to sound. But I don't think the video image was ever supposed to look like this. Listen. Buy the Blue Underground DVD. As of 2013, it's probably the best way to see this flick in the home video format. And you know what? I'm ok with that.
B00B23Z2IE|4.0|This is the kind of music that SHOULD be on the radio, if radio (Clear Channel) cared about promoting good music. BUT, as we all know this just isn't the case. If you want to hear music like this you have to find it on your own. Thankfully there are labels like Daptone, Now-Again, Soundway and Analog Africa.<br /><br />Would have been awesome if Daptone had thought of issuing a 2 disc deluxe edition with all the tracks in instrumental format. Oh well, perhaps at some point in the future.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004LWZWC4|4.0|This film is worth seeing just for the photography alone. The bird pictures and scenery are great. Adding to this is a satisfying story with solid performances by Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson.

B005LAII4E|1.0|Growing up during the heyday of the G.I. Joe brand (mid to late 80's), I really wanted to like the new G.I. Joe movie series. I saw Rise of Cobra and it was meh.  I just went to see Retaliation in the theaters and what a disappointment.  While the action scenes are great, the storyline is terrible.  I think Hasbro did a disservice to the franchise by letting these movies get produced.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have followed all of the films of the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; series and this is yet another addition to my library. Although I feel the actual large screen theater presentation is much more dramatic, the small screen of a home unit is still very satisfactory. So far I have collected all of the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; films.

This book is very well written and deals with the problem of our build in bias in so called objective reasoning. The bayes and the bias I would subtitle it. A must read !

B001GUXJQA|4.0|I love the Harry Bosch novels.  The Black Ice is a roller coaster ride filled with  constant twists and turns.  I just wish I could be as bright and intuitive as Harry, lol.  Anyone who reads it won't be disappointed.  I just wish I had read the series in order for continuity's sake; but that isn't a big issue.
0810979772|1.0|this  book was not like new, scruibbled all over inside book and pages torn right out and missing. I expect some use, but completely untrue about inside  of book. I was very disappointed. They did send it fast and thats the only reason I gave them 1 star.
B00005JOIH|5.0|Umm.....first of all L.Wright, if you only watched 20-30 minutes than you didn't even give it a chance. The plotting in the beginning is very necessary. Secondly, this movie is full of awesome action. Aside from Saving Private Ryan, it might be Spielbergs most action packed and violent films. After 30-45 minutes, the killings and assassinations start and they do not stop for 2 hours. I've never heard such a false statement about a film as the one you made. I suggest if you don't care about the planning, that you fast forward to the first kill and then get ready for an awesome ride. I hate boring movies so I know what I'm talking about here. this movie is full of machine guns, explosions silenced zip guns and plenty other cool, imaginative and well planned revenge kills. Watch it again dude!!!!
B009R8DHAQ|5.0|This book is Awasome I mean I am really young ok ok I'm nine I love reading this book if you are a grown up then give this to your kids if you like to read especially if you do not like to read than this is a book for you :-)

B00AKFG15S|4.0|Of course I rushed to buy this third chronicle, having read first two.  However, I was slightly disappointed as it is not up to Jeffrey Archer's previous high standards as a story teller.  I think he's running out of ideas as to how to keep the reader interested.  However, I can't wait for the next one as one get's so caught up in the lives of the characters.  It's an interesting time period after World War II and I like anything to do with this era .  He gives an interesting insight into how an election works and brings in all the aspects of his own life experiences - i.e. auctions and art - but then why not, as the reader finds out how these things work.  Go on read it but you must read Chronicles One and Two first.  I am a great Archer fan so I gave it four stars as three is not quite enough.

B005GIS23I|4.0|Great flick that works as a nice tribute to some of the best alien movies and TV shows of the last few decades and a sly satire to some of the same films and shows. You'll see nods to everything from ET to X-Files and laugh hysterically pretty much from start to finish.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Love this album, love maroon 5 especially adam levine. Cant wait until the next album, uts sure to be a hit as well!!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I love Tarantino's work, especially Inglorious Basterds and when I heard another movie with as much brutality was being made, I was sold. I think Jamie Foxx is a talented actor and he doesn't get enough credit, seriously. Christoph Waltz is awesome for a newcomer to American films but he has more talent than half of the people that call themselves \\"talented\\" in Hollywood. Together, with the direction of Tarantino, they put on one hell of a perfomance. DiCaprio throws in a lot of humorous drama and when spun together, they put on a compelling and intellectual shoot em' up and talk it out later film. When I saw I could pre-order the film on bluray; as Dr. King Schultz says in the movie, \\"I couldn't resist.\\"XD
1449410243|5.0|Funny and clever. Why are the 17 more words required?? Can't I just say I liked it? I don't have any more to say

0062082353|5.0|What a great read.  I learned quite a few things that were never broadcast on the news.  For an autobiography, this was a gripping tale and not boring at all.  It was a shame Kyle was killed while trying to help out an ex GI.  He was a true hero.  I would recommend the book to anyone.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was an excellent read.  I recommend all three........I finished them all in four days.  Very good story line with some much more added for your entertainment and pleasure.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I am eleven and I got addicted to it. The only flaw is they give your horse a name. This game is really fun and would recommend this to parents with young children who get bored a lot like I do. It will keep them entertained for hours.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super fun!  Also this game is very addicting and my favorite part is when you get a rocket and go up in the air and you get a lot of coins!
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|Bought my first charger a few years ago and am going to pick up another today for my Wifes imac.<br />Replacing the regular magic mouse batteries gets really annoying if you are a heavy computer user. With the mobi charger that problem is gone but just remember to put the mouse on the charger when you shut down for the day.<br /><br />The charger has worked perfectly but one thing to consider is heavy usage will diminish the life of the mobi nimh cells. I had to buy a replacement after a year. The replacement I bought actually died after 2 months but Amazon quickly replaced if for me free of charge so this new pack has been going strong since.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Great fast paced action / mystery / thriller. Action from the moment it starts to the end. Get all your snacks and get ready there are no breaks and nowhere you really want to pause the video. So just side back and enjoy it as it twist and turns from one MI task to the next.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I was looking to buy a used one but the price was great for a new one. The Nikon SB-700 Speedlight Flash arrived quickly from the seller and works well with the Nikon d7100.  I recommend this product.
0385535147|5.0|As a rookie novelist myself, I've heard the mantra, \\"You've got to make the reader care about your hero.\\" Nobody does that as well as John Grisham. The Racketeer continues his mastery and has a plot that kept me guessing and caught me by surprise several times. One of the ways Grisham inveigles readers into liking his heroes is by poking fun--usually gently--at them. Who wouldn't chuckle at his depiction of Reed Baldwin in a motel bed with his girlfriend but neither able to keep their eyes or thoughts away from the bundle of loot that sits on the next bed? Also as usual and also skillfully rendered, Grisham has a social point to make in The Racketeer. Without becoming preachy or interrupting the narrative flow, he portrays the world-beating U.S. incarceration rate in a way that encourages the reader to examine its results and costs. John Grisham is one of the few best-selling genre writers whose work remains fresh, novel after novel, and The Racketeer is another example.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The product arrived quickly and I must say that I love it.  I saw a number of bags that were more expensive but this bag rocks.  You can configure the sections any way you want and there's plenty of room for my camera, lenses and all of my accessories.  I like it so much I may purchase another one.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|I have loved this movie from the first time my sister introduced it me many years back. It is one of the most romantic movies I have ever watched.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|Fantastic story. Well told and enjoyable.I have read all three of the authors books and enjoyed every one.I would really recommend her  books to anyone who enjoys great storytelling and interesting if slightly damaged people.
B005LAII4E|3.0|I have to confess, I really, really liked the first film.  You decide if you want to keep reading after I give my reasons for it.  Most people tend to dislike G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra because it's not a faithful adaptation of the cartoon.  For that same reason many people dislike Dolph Lungdren's vehicle Masters of the Universe and Michael Bay's Transformers.  And it's a WRONG reason.  Why?  Well, because neither of those movies are actually based on a cartoon.  The licenses the filmmakers got to make those movies were from the toy lines.  The cartoons are adaptations of the toys and the movies are adaptations of the toys, but the movies are not adaptations of the cartoons.  That's why you can't expect them to be similar.  It'd be like complaining that Batman Begins is a poor adaptation of Bruce Timm's Batman Animated Series.  It's not, they're both different adaptations of the same source material.<br /><br />That being said, I think filmmakers could do a better job if they took a glance at what worked in the most successful adaptations of the source material and apply it to their own adaptations (riding the last example, I think it's pretty obvious Nolan took a good glance at the Batman Animated Series when he prepared to make his Batman film, just like that series clearly was influenced by Tim Burton's films).<br /><br />In any case, I really have no memories of the cartoon.  I sort of remember it watching it but pretty much nothing about it but the name.  The reason for it is probably that unlike for other cartoons like, say, He-Man, Duck Tales or Super Friends, I never got a chance to watch G.I. Joe reruns when I got older, so it's a forgotten show for me.  That allowed me to see The Rise of Cobra with a clean mind and while its value as an adaptation escapes me, I think it's a competent and even great fun action flick.  It's no less realistic than anything Arnie has done, and it knows how to mantain a good pacing.  And while it has a lot of characters, it does a good job of giving them all good screen time and something fun to do.<br /><br />Enter the sequel, G.I. Joe: Retaliation.  In case you were busy fighting cockroach men in an alternate dimension for the past year, you probably know this movie was ready to be released some eight-nine months ago and they decided to delay it to this year.  Three major reasons were given for it.  Actually, scratch that, only one major reason was given for it, the other two are either minor or speculation.  The reason they gave was that they wanted to do a 3D conversion.  The other reason that was barely mentioned was that since one of the only four actors to come back for the sequel (five if you count CGI Arnold Vosloo's half-face), Channing Tatum, had acquired some newfound fame, they wanted to film some extra scenes with him.  The speculated reason was that the studio wasn't happy with the film.<br /><br />Now, it's perfectly true that they did a 3D conversion.  I can't speak for its quality, though, since I watched it in 2D.  It's also true they added a few more scenes with Tatum.  And if the third reason isn't true, then the studio didn't actually watch the film.<br /><br />If you've seen the trailer, you'll notice that the basic gist of the film is that the old team (lead by Tatum's Duke) gets killed and what's left of the new guys (The Rock, Adrianne Palicki and D.J. Cotrona) need to team up with the oldest member of the team, name-giver Joe (Bruce Willis) to fight a returning Cobra Commander (not Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and save the world from his influence due to master-of-disguise Zartan posing as the president.<br /><br />Speculation was that the new scenes filmed with Tatum would be to reveal Duke's survival after his on-screen death but I'm going to spoil this for you because you need to know what the filmmakers wasted nine months on:  Duke dies.  He doesn't come back, his death is barely suffered and his name is only mentioned once after the fact.  No, the added scenes with Tatum were all at the beginning of the film, in which he sucks at playing videogames, sucks at shooting and sucks at making comebacks.  And he's probably one of the actors with more screen time.<br /><br />You see, this movie's choice of screen time for the characters is atrocious.  You'll go out of the movie thinking President Zartan is the protagonist, since he's the one we see the most.  Yet the rest of the characters have so little time on screen that I had to double check my watch after exiting the theater to confirm the movie hadn't last only half an hour.  I hadn't seen so many characters with so poor characterization since Mortal Kombat: Anihilation.  Hey, that's actually a great comparison.  Characters are on screen for a minute or two, do something and exit unceremoniously with little to no explanation.  Want to know how Storm Shadow survived the first film?  You're out of luck because he simply shows up and no one seems surprised.  Is Jynx a character you are interested in?  Well, too bad, because she maybe has two lines of dialogue and none of them are about her.  Are you excited for Bruce Willis showing up as a mentor figure for these guys?  Sucks to be you (and me), because he has maybe three minutes of screen time and all he does is give the Joes some weapons and shoot a couple of bullets by himself.<br /><br />And once you're watching the movie, they do the same.  They set expectations that are never met.  They show Duke and Roadblock being friends and the latter seems to completely forget about the former's death minutes after the fact.  They try to picture Flint as a loose cannon at the very beginning to completely forget about his existence in the middle.  They hint at a romance between him and Lady Jaye and that never goes anywhere.  They set a moment in which Snake Eyes is about to be seen as the culprit for his master's death and that is ignored instantly.  When introducing Jynx they mention she's related to Storm Shadow yet up until the climax they act like strangers the few moments they're together.<br /><br />So why three stars instead of five?  Well, to be fair, it's a visually appealing film.  The few action scenes it has are nice looking, if not as interesting as the ones in the first film.  There's a battle in the middle between Snake Eyes, Jynx and a bunch of ninjas that goes out of its way in increasingly ridiculous stunts to go for the classic \\"bad guys chasing the good guys are taken out one by one by the environment\\", but it's nice.  The Cobras' new superweapon packs a punch in a way that Roland Emmerich would be jealous.  Newcomer villain Firefly is interesting in a Metal-Gear-Solid-Boss sort of way but, like everyone else, he's underused.  His appereance in the film was crazily enhanced momentarily for me in a moment in which, I swear to God, a real firefly showed up in my theater.  I was ready to compliment the amazing 3D effect when I remembered I wasn't watching the film in 3D.  Jonathan Pryce is clearly having a blast playing President Zartan, and you either love him or hate him.  The Rock is still a great action star, and he does a good job with what little he has.  The new Cobra Commander looks very cool.  And Adrianne Palicki is really, REALLY hot.  She looked ridiculous in her Wonder Woman outfit, but in this film she's pure, delicious, sweet eye candy.  Heck, two stars from this review are for her presence alone.  That being said, her character has nothing to do.  There's the aforementioned forgotten romance and a half-baked backstory about her father, whose conclusion would be underwhelming if it was something that had had any sort of impact in the film.<br /><br />So yeah, count me as one who enjoyed the first movie better.  If I decide to get this movie on Blu-Ray I'll update the review to include info on the disks.  That being said, the only reason I would potentially get this film is Adriane Palicki in HD.  She definitely needs more exposure.ith Tatum were all at the beginning of the film, in which he sucks at playing videogames, sucks at shooting and sucks at making comebacks.

B009KEN87O|5.0|This great little app really captures the fun of those after school days in the arcade when I was a kid- but unlike those old arcade games, this one fits in my pocket! Very well done.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Amazing acting, an incredibly engaging look into a world I never thought of.  Dark subject with plenty of comic relief.
B007EDYN36|3.0|Gross, whine, whine, whine.  Gene is mean, he took all my money. It's about the music MAN!  LOL.  After reading this I wouldn't stand within 50 feet of any of those guys.  YUCK!!
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|This book was so entertaining, I couldn't put it down.  It had everything in spades.  Great characters, plots (plenty) and great writing skills.  It made sense and was for adults.  I've bought several books in this genre by other authors only to find out that they were more suited to children's books and was sorely disappointed. This book was funny, sad, exciting and heart warming.  It had everything you could wish for in a fantasy adventure with wonderful characters.  Can't wait for Lady Carriger's next book.  I've already complained to her that her books are too short (they're really not) and to make them at least a zillion pages next time around.  FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
030758836X|5.0|Gone girl made me uncomfortable, made me cringe, made me laugh out loud, made me hate these characters, and I absolutely loved it.  flynn's writing is brutally honest, especially when she writes about &#34;fun girl&#34;, and how being perfect in a relationship is unsustainable.  Amy is definitely a murdering psychopath, no doubt about it.  The book took me by surprise though that she'd get that crazy.  Read it, read it, read it!
B004NDVJJG|5.0|The Marcin Wasilewski Trio continue to amaze me.  I didn't think I would like this CD nearly as much as I do.  The sample tracks I had listened to on Amazon sounded too mellow and somber for my tastes at the time.  So, I didn't purchase the album when it first came out.  I saw it listed recently from a re-seller for a decent price, so I decided to get it.  And I'm blown away at how great it is.<br /><br />There are no group compositions here, like there were with the CDs &#34;Trio&#34; and &#34;January.&#34;  Marcin Wasilewski wrote five of the tracks, and the rest are covers, including the title track, which was penned by Ornette Coleman.  All of the songs complement one another, and (as such) the arrangement of these tracks on the CD is crucial to what the listener takes away from the record.<br /><br />These artists are at the top of their game with this record, and their performances are beautiful and engaging.  Highly recommended.
B001HDWKMA|5.0|Such a rich voice & at 2.99, who could pass it up!!! i would recommend this to fans of the national, amos lee, or most introspective indie bands/artists.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|In light of Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, I anticipated some deviation and elaboration on the story. Some of the elaborations I liked, such as the greater detail regarding the Necromancer. Some of the deviation, e.g. the Pale Orc, was a bit disappointing. I see what Jackson is trying to do by bringing a key antagonist onto the scene, but I think it takes away from the importance of Smaug as the main (albeit delayed) antagonist. But overall, thus far, it has been fun to watch, and I look forward to see the rest of Jackson's product.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|It was a birthday present and the person loved it. It had most of the songs on it that they wanted.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I like having this type of reference app on my Kindle. It has most if not all the features you see on the their website. It just takes a while getting use to the change in format.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Full of intrigue and very gripping. A book that's very hard to put down. Very cleverly written. Recommended to all but may appeal more to females
B000VECAC6|5.0|This movie is still one of my favorite Python movies. It is irreverent and funny, funny, funny.  If the story idea offends you, lighten up and learn to laugh.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|i love to play games so i choose some game to play and this one of them  i like to play
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It takes a while to get use to the change in format but it works really well. Well worth using on a Kindle Fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love to play games so i choose some game to play and this one of them  i like to play
B008M87GJK|4.0|I like this app overall. It provides the news and information I want and it works well on my Kindle.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|One of the best games I have ever played. It has the perfect difficulty and graphics. I play about two hours a day. Thank you glu for creating another awesome game. LOVE IT!!!
B001AQR3E4|4.0|It's not up there with the classic tale of Dracula, but it pretty good overall. Good cast. good screen play and direction.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|can't believe we had never hear Rodriquez' music.  A wonderful warm and evocative story told well.  Sixto is a man whose life has meaning in a context that most of us haven't really considered.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|It takes a while to get use to the change in format but it works really well. Well worth using on a Kindle Fire.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This is a fun game &amp; easy to play.  I have never played it with a deck of cards!  It's a good way to let my mind idle in neutral to de-stress from the rigors of life. I find it also helps focus on the details as I challenge myself to not use the hints provided.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I just happened on to an episode of Dr. Quinn and since I missed the series when it originally was on TV, I decided to order this set. I have been watching the discs whenever I have free time and have been completely hooked. Too bad this series was cancelled. Definitely one of the better shows. Can't wait to finish all the discs then plan to watch them all over again.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Do you like good music? Do you like acoustic guitar? Do you like songs that are so catchy that you'll be singing them for days? If so, buy this album!<br /><br />The lumineers have really put something special together here. They purposely set out to make an album that is enjoyable, and makes no pretenses about being anything more than just good music. There's nothing complicated about the songs, and half of them sound like they could have been recorded during a live show in a small bar. That's the charm of it though. It's real, and right there.<br /><br />The album is really a refreshing change from the current stack of artists that put out overproduced songs with loads of samples and loops. It's like this album is saying to the rest of the world &#34;hey man, you don't need to do all that. Just make music&#34;. A truly great find.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|Excellent product<br />I received it in excellent conditions.<br />The watch is beautiful and filled all my expectations<br />No problems in purchasing
B000002H5I|5.0|I was actually looking for the Amazon mp3 version of this album when I noticed that the CD has the files on AutoRip so you get the mp3s with purchase. That was a no brainer considering the actual CD is about $6 less than buying the mp3 files right now.<br /><br />It really is a beautiful album. It takes a rare talent to be able to pick up a guitar and keep the audience in rapt attention with just a few simple notes and chords. Tracy Chapman does that and more. I am so glad I picked this up again.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|G5 has delivered another fun game that immediately sucks you in. With tricky puzzle sequences and a bizarre story line, the only thing I didn't care for was the main characters dialogue.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Great game to just waste some time, like when standing in line.  Simple enough for kids, entertaining enough for adults.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This is the best thing I think I have ever read in my life. This book is very truly amazing.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This story will touch the heart of anyone who watches it!! exciting and deeply moving!!  The ending is bitter sweet!!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love this game. Can't stop playing if. A must get<br />For anyone who loves war games. I promise you will love this freaking game.
1582701709|3.0|too much Oprah hype,,, didn't tell me anything i didn't already know<br />would not recommend it or read it again.. just would rather stick to the erotic stories and not life lessons that i already know
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|another  find  that was  a great price and as  usual arrived  within the allotted time period. looking forward to making more purchases
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Makes reading available practically anywhere, anytime.  Very user friendly interface and nice features to customizing the reading experience for you.
B00005Q4DW|5.0|I had the Cradle of Life but needed this movie as well. Now to buy the third movie  . I have ordered a few things from amazon.com and so far I have no complaints
6305535264|4.0|In the wake of the colossal success of \\"Star Wars\\" in the late '70s, by the early 1980s sci-fi, which had experienced a dry period throughout the early to mid '70s, was again a big business, with such films as \\"Battle Beyond the Stars,\\" \\"Outland,\\" and \\"Horror Planet\\" all surfacing at the time.  Continuing this tradition is Stanley Donen's \\"Saturn 3\\" (1980), which was a British production filmed in Shepperton, England, but with an American director, producer and cast.<br /><br />On a remote research station on one of Saturn's uninhabited moons, the sole crew members, Kirk Douglas and Farah Fawcett, experience unseen difficulty in accomplishing their project and worse, are shadow-locked for three days during a particularly bad eclipse.  Another scientist (played by Harvey Keitel), who just happens to also be a real nutcase behind the unassuming exterior, brings in his deceptively cute robot Hector, to help with the mission.  Only Hector's brain is linked with Keitel's, and they both have the hots for crew member Alex (Fawcett).  It isn't long before both Keitel and the robot propose a real threat, in Keitel's mad plan to seize control of the station, not to mention the affections of Alex.<br /><br />I want to start by saying that I love vintage sci-fi movies from this period, including all the ones mentioned above.  \\"Saturn 3\\" does have a lot going for it.  Both the special effects and set design are fabulous, as is the spellbinding score composed by Elmer Bernstein.  There is even a seconds-long shot of a bare-breasted Fawcett, not to mention some requisite gore (this was an R-rated film after all) including a body torn apart in a shredder, not to mention a hand severed from its limb.  But on the other hand, there are also some more dreary, dull stretches to be found, and a principle cast of only three presents challenges, meaning there is not a whole lot of variation in tone throughout.<br /><br />This movie does bear nostalgic value to me though.  It was one of thevery first titles, along with others like \\"Phantasm,\\" \\"the Onion Field,\\" and \\"North Dallas Forty,\\" that I remember seeing on the shelves of the very first mom and pop video store to open in our area in 1981-82 when I was 6 or 7.  I did not get to see the actual movie though until much later on in the '90s in snatches on cable, and in its entirety for the first time only on DVD.  Speaking of the DVD itself, my main complaint with it is that they didn't use the far superior original movie poster (see Wikipedia page) for the cover.  A small qualm though, I suppose, to get to see such a rare film from my childhood.<br /><br />All in all, I'm settling on a solid 3 1/2 stars for \\"Saturn 3\\" because its rewatch value is not quite as high as some of its fellow brethren in the genre, but hardcore adult sci-fi addicts should be satisfied.  Not a masterpiece by any means, but a lot better than most movies coming out today, and retains a vintage sci-fi feel throughout.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I just wasted $5.95 renting this movie. Hated it so much that I could only watch half of the movie. In addition, the streaming from Amazon rendered this impossible to watch.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Gillian Flynn writes so well....loved how she would go back & forth between time events and present day.  Not my usual read but definitely captivating.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Shows the inside life of Lincoln during one of the most troubled times in this country yet he fights all odds against him for the betterment of human rights and the 13th amendment. If only our current political parties could learn from this.
B005VPRDAY|4.0|So remembering lego bricks yes that's proper term and its crazy I know that. I decided I needed some so I figured i'd pick this up along with the normal color set about the same size.  I am glad I did I'm now going to pick up larger set and just cause I can I am going to attempt to make a 2 seat doll stroller chubby 12 inch baby dolls. You know the 1's that always seem to fall out of normal doll strollers. I just have to try among other things I want to make I haven't fully figured anything out yet but I am going to try. I really didn't understand that flat bricks could be useful and some of bricks and acesories I wont use in both sets but overall it really is great product I even acdetinally have layed on couple they haven't broken. And I love the purples and lighter blues in this set. I'm not biggest pink person but this pink dosen't make me want to puke. However keep in mind its a small set for your enthusist you might wabt to get bigger set.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After looking at gaming mouse reviews for pricier models/companies, I finally settled on this based on what others said.  Definitely not disappointed!  Comfortable, like the button placement, and the side buttons are much easier to use than my previous mouse.  Highly recommend, can't imagine there's many choices that could be this for quality and price.  I didn't care about the LED light feature, but I actually found myself playing with the color.  It's only the Anker symbol that changes color though FYI, not the DPI lights or scroll wheel.
0062238868|5.0|Great book, very fluid language, I recommend it to any one that like war action.<br />Love it! This book shows a new face to the war.
B00BI5IXL4|2.0|I must have seen the musical about 5 times, and each time I watched I enjoyed like the first time. Then came the movie version. Even though I was enjoying at the start, I was disappointed about many major issues. At the start I said to my self, its OK if Jean Valjean and any other characters in the movie have no voices as long as they the acting is great, which was, but that killed the intention of being one of the greatest musicals of all times. If I hadn't seen the stage production with fabulous voices and live music, I would probably have given 5 stars. Here are the major issues that I had.<br />1. The make up was over done to create more horrors of the street life.<br />2. 90% of the movie is gloomy, and sad, even when Mario meets Cosette for the first time. The scene should have been lighten with positive colors and emotions, common, its love, give us some light.<br />3. The director missed a lot of details, especially in the song Master of the house.<br />4. Master of the house and his wife wrong casting, they are the best looking actors in the movie, LOL. They should have missing teeth or whatever. Sasha Cohen, did not fit his role not in acting or singing. In stage production this scene is one of the main attraction<br />5. \\"Bring him home\\" song, which always gives me chills and crowd's standing ovation on stage was destroyed.<br />6. I could hardly hear the orchestra, because the voices were to weak. The music is very powerful and should have been played this way.<br /><br />I could go on, but will stop right there, in my opinion the movie Phantom was much better interpretation than The Miserables, in spite that Phantom had to compete with Michael Crawford.<br />Over all, it was not bad, but I could only watch it once. And if the musical stage production will ever be back in town, I would go and see it again.
0439813786|5.0|Pencil illustrations do not just illustrate events in the narrative of the written story, which is the typical way illustrations are used in children's books. the story alternates between pages of illustrations and pages of text. Each series of illustrations carries the story forward, an integral part of the book. Skip the illustrations and you skip part of the book. The book is enchanting, magical, historical. It wet my granddaughter's appetite to read bigger books, because the illustrations moved her from text section to text section, and the writing is so enticing. This is the book she learned what a page turner was.<br /><br />High praise to author Brian Selznick.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I picked this up for my Kindle Fire HD as I hadn't read it in probably 20 years.  It was just as good the second time around.  My son was taken with antihero Long John Silver and likened him to Captain Jack Sparrow (not sure I see that, but given that he liked the book I wasn't too worried about it).  Overall, he really enjoyed the book.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|I enjoyed reading this story.  The plot was believable and the sociology seems realistic.  I will look for a follow up book in the series.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Most of the reviews I see are more like Cliff's Notes, which kind of defeats the purpose of recommending someone read a book.  What I'll say is that this book is beautiful and nasty (think Faust).  While it can be windy, the overall takeaway--at least for me--is that I'm glad I read it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Excellent!!! I was able to download it instantly with Amazon app store. The game is great to use. Easy to build with and you can play with another person if they are on the same network!!!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I read it in junior high.  I gave it to my eldest daughter to read in elementary school.  My son just finished it.  The discussions it prompted made for some very quality father-child time.  Read it and then give it to your kids to read; you'll all come out enriched.
B0000033IS|5.0|This is the first album purchase by in 1967. After listening to it, I bought another copy for soon to be wife. I love the album then and now. It cut on the album is good to great
B0000VCZKW|4.0|Written by the same author who gave us &#34;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#34; and &#34;James and the Giant Peach,&#34; &#34;Matilda&#34; holds my toddler rapt while imparting some interesting life lessons.  We had the VHS from a time when our teenagers were much, much younger and decided that an upgrade was worth the money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game i use it every day literally. I recommend this game to everyone . This game shows the reall life taking care of a horse and yes i would know that.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game alone is responsible for me not having written the Great American Novel.  Or having discovered cold fusion.  Or having brokered a lasting peace in the Middle East.  I've got all of these things on my To-Do List, but I just can't seem to get around to them as I keep finding myself sidetracked by flinging birds at green pig-zombies.  And I'm okay with that.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very creative and gives lots of opportunities to continue playing the game if you decide not to spend Money. Obviously quicker and more advanced buildings come with using money in the game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like how real it looks and sounds and I like horses anyway so this is a definite download and keep.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This was unlike anything I've ever read.  A courageous mother, a resilient boy in a horrific situation, locked up for years in a tiny space.  Then having to cope in the outside world, especially strange and frightening to the boy.  It was sad, it was encouraging and sometimes funny.  I loved it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|time consuming to wait for supplies to replenish, but a great game!<br /> good for a half hour or so a day, then wait for supplies.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Another great CD by andrea Bocelli.  If you love a great voice and romantic music you need to add this to your collection.
B009S33I68|5.0|General Moore's book is recommend reading for my military students. He has written a saga that honors the brave men whom he led in battle. For fans of the movie, that is only half of the book. The entire story needs to be told.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Great summer read on the beach. This book is funny, and if you're looking for something light and fun then this is the book for you.
B00846REIS|2.0|If you read Grey for the explicit sex, you will probably like this book.  I'm finished with half of it and still trying to figure out the story.  All I can think of is disfunctional. Not just the hero and heroine  but all the characters seem broken in one way or another.  Sex with a capital S yes.  Good read (or listen) not for me.
B003XT603Q|5.0|I went into this book with no expectations whatsoever. I tend to steer away from depressing books and if I had a clue what this book was about I would have never read it.<br /><br />Having said that, this book is one of my favorite books. Murakami’s writing is poetic and manages to make you bask in a shower of emotions and feelings.<br /><br />This book is what I would call a &#34;mood&#34; book. Norwegian Wood gripped my soul and touched me deeply even though I must admit that it is a dark book at times. Still, I must say I am in love with this book. For some reason, this book seemed to transport me into a certain mood and stirred up profound feelings. I guess it put me in the same mood that the song Norwegian Wood and Life Aquatic put me in.<br /><br />The plot/etc might seem simplistic at the surface but it's not about the shallow surface. Deeper layers are at play here, layers that toy and provoke your soul. Yummm....<br /><br />You would either LOATHE this book, or fall absolutely head over heels in love with it.
B0074MZSPO|1.0|This review is of the vinyl. Whoever put this on vinyl should be fired. I listened to it on You Tube. I loved the songs. So I thought I'd buy the record. But the vinyl didn't sound any better. WTF!
B008OOYALE|1.0|this game is the lamest thing I have ever downloaded its like I have to wait so dang long for for only 100 coins and you caint but nothing with 100 coins...this game is just plain stupid
0938045768|5.0|I did my research on this book and others because I wanted to focus on bodyweight exercises. After two days of viewing almost a dozen books I picked this one and boy did I pick the right one! I work sundays at my job and it is super dead so I read 90% of it there and the rest on the train ride home(around a 45 minute ride) & wound up finishing the whole book. Took be about 8 hours to finish the whole thing. Went home, got changed and headed to the pull up bar in my local school yard. Each of the \\"Big Six\\" workouts has 10 steps, each other them more difficult than the last. Being I am in better shape then the average man I started most of the exercises on the 4th or 5th step. It was one of the best workouts I have ever had. Im sore as I write this review and I only worked out 90 minutes ago. If you want to \\"get ahead of the pack\\" in the fitness world I don't think it is possible without this book! He gives you knowledge that last a life time and supports everything he says with facts. Highly HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone looking to improve their fitness level or to get started on their journey of fitness.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|im a 13 year old girl and this game is just amazing I love it to death and no there is nothing *wrong with me* Lol its just a fun thing to keep your mind on.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|We could no do anything with this. As far as we can tell it doesn't work. Very disappointing to us all. Will check others out however this game doesn't wok at all.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|This show is an edge of your seat show....keeps your heart pounding and you guessing.  For some reason this episode did not DVR and love having the opportunity to watch it on here!
B00BR476TG|2.0|Too many questions, why not just put the tiger on the raft?  Left lingering as to why the insurance agents couldn't believe story 1.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I saw the movie as a child after I read the book. I stumbled on the title in my kindle. It is enjoyable once more through your library.
B000JLTRIG|4.0|Like the entire series<br /><br />It came very fast but it had some kind of sticky stuff on the top of the disk<br /><br />Recommended series to all but not the seller
B0002PZVH0|4.0|Used as background music for living Stations of the Cross.  It worked out beautifully.  Provided a great backdrop to a solemn occasion and helped the readers pace themselves.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Excellent predictive text and I personally feel it is more responsive and better looking than the stock keyboard. Try the free trial version first and you will end up buying it too!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Love this game.  Never gets old can play over and over.  Have played through a couple of times and still love to see how high of a score I can get.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|really enjoy this game. progress is very slow and some items are nearly unattainable without purchasing game $. I wish the game $ was a bit cheaper.  The game is still enjoyable playing for free.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|You just have to love Anthony Hopkins and his brilliant acting in this film.  It was brilliantly acted and I really felt like I was watching Alfred Hitchcock!  Highly recommended!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Seeing Mark on TV isn't like reading a boom about him. Also the Game changers on Bloomberg had some facts that didnt show the truth . It was interesting to see how Mark was going through different events in his life towards success.  Very good read .
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|We thoroughly enjoyed watching this film.  The whole movie was a joy to watch!  We highly recommend it to anyone looking for a Saturday film with quality entertainment!
B0017VT5E8|4.0|Sylvester Stallone's first major role, and a great depiction of 1972 Philadelphia, plus the rise of an underdog and the inspiration that says anything is possible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love games and have really high expectations for the game itself. This game is absolutely great. The graphics are magnificent and it even has themed journeys. Some other apps I have purchased and downloaded froze quite often but I have had this game for ages and hasn't froze once.<br />11/10 Brilliant
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It i s a really fun game u can get alot of power ups and it is really easay to get coins
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I choose this rating because all you do is build a village, there is no action,no mind stimulation.  I would recommend this game to no one.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|Soon as I learn to use it I'll be happy the price and app are good. Friend has one and it works great
B008XG1X18|5.0|Everything is in there... Everything you can think of ,and then everything you can dream of... anything you want to know .... at your fingertips in your own space like or pin it's in your personal space for easy reference and sharing.... I just luv it :)
0525953728|5.0|I found this book to be more than I had imagined. It is more the story of a dedicated individual and his desire be one of the best. also, the road he had to go to get there. I found none of the sensitive information that the pentagon made such a big deal about, maybe it was to help sell the book but it was not necessary. The book stands on its own merit. Thanks to the author.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|When you reach my is by-far one of the best books I`'ve ever read. I didn't understand it at first,  but when the laughing man came in, it all made sense.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was recommended by my best friend who thinks a lot like me. He said this book was awesome and he was right. I had a hard time putting it down. I just finished it and it is 3:53am.. Any one who loves the eighties and games must read this book. Thank little bro for the recommendation..
B0001MLMKY|4.0|Vendedor confiable 100 % lo felicito da gusto hacer negocios con usted. Excelente servicio, el producto totalmente original hice una buena compra.
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|Jonas sings with his heart and soul.  What a great voice! Love the songs he choose for this album very much, they are rear and beautiful. His Jiulietta et Romeo piece by Zandonai blows my mind... So much feeling...  Highly recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I think it's grest . I'm able to catch up on missed episodes. I also can reveiw forgotten episodes from my library..
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|I want it mainly because the fact that the Wesendonck Lieder was mainly performed by female singers. And Kaufmann chose the Lieder because it was written to describe Wagner's  feeling at the time by his girl friend. I like the material Kaufmann selected for his albums. The man has so much talent, knowledge and musicianship. To me, he brings new life into opera singing and performance. I am trill to be able listen to this man besides Placido Domingo and LP the Great. He is the tenor of the 21st Century!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish this game has caves and have some mods that work on the computer to work on this i want better weapons like more ranged weapons
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book! Never read this kind of genre before but I was pleasantly surprised. It bought it all home
B0050SYS5A|3.0|I don't know if it was just the one I bought or all of them, but I couldn't get this to work.  I don't like giving a negative comment without having tested more than one, but I am sharing my experience.  The seller was great and product arrived on time without visible damage and I was able to return without problem!  I recommend the seller but not the product.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed the complete series. Got a good deal on the books. I was able to get the series for five dollars
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|Second book in the series that I have read. Somewhat formulaic, but character development makes for like-able good guys, and really evil bastard bad guys. And it's always nice when the cavalry rides in.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like minecraft its a fun game to play and even though there is killing and dieing its not super graphic like most of the video games you see now a days.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one, though I do almost hope it's the last one so that Thomas and his friends can finally be left alone in peace.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I have all the seasons and now all the movies. Got to love the New York ladies who rocked until the very end!
0786182466|5.0|I love this book so much it made me laugh and laugh. I bought the tapes because I thought I would like to listen to them but I can't get into it so I will just read the book again.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this is definatly my favorite game. it is very boring at first but after a little while it becomes the best game ever.  my advice: hang in there.  it is a waiting game so don't expect constant entertainment.  I only get on for about 15 minutes a day.
1589795474|5.0|Awesome book with great insights into the mind of millionaires. If your goal is to become wealthy this book will teach you how the wealthy spend their money and why.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The book was the author's story. I was expecting more of the experiences of heaven. Parts of the experience felt wrong, even anti scriptural. I questioned if the author did not go far enough into the heavenly realm and possibly experienced some deception. Even though, as a natural optomist, I was disappointed, I enjoyed the book and am glad I read it.
B000VYX8PE|2.0|I bought this for my grandson and am very glad I read it first. It's probably fine for older kids, but the younger or not quite mature enough will likely find much disturbing about the situation and plot. The children in the story have just lost their parents and their home and end up in a situation where they are threatened by adults and not helped by others. While the kids manage to save themselves by the end of the book, they end up headed for more problems rather than moving into a safe and stable situation. I may actually read more of the series to see what happens, but I'm not giving it to my grandson for several more years.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It somewat is worth reading. But the ending sure sucked. Sorry it needed more. I would suggest a second book.
0307474275|2.0|I admit I only read the book because it was being made into a movie and everyone at the time seemed to have an opinion about whether the book was from the pit of hell or not.<br />I was sorely disappointed in it's predictability concerning both who the main antagonist was and what secret was ultimately being protected.  Dan Brown is no good at dropping hints that you can only pick up on a second reading: he makes them glaringly obvious the first time around.<br />Anyone who has ever taken a religion class will realize exactly where he is going, and will probably spend half the book going \\"well that's highly debated\\"...\\"that's not actually accurate.\\"<br />And anyone who has ever read a book before will be able to guess \\"the big twist.\\"<br />At the time I felt that aside from a knowledge of codes, I was perfectly capable of having written the book myself at only 19...except I never would have published it, it's so bad.  Apparently people like bad writing.<br /><br />It is an easy read, which is why I haven't given up on hoping he will eventually learn how to keep his plot twists under his hat until he's ready to unveil them.
B009AMANBA|1.0|I was disappointed with this movie even though I watched it twice.  Daniel Day-Lewis was a very believable Lincoln. I wanted to hit Sally Field's character during several scenes in the movie. She was so annoying!! No wonder Lincoln suffered with depression. The characters were hard to follow unless you knew them via history books. I had to look them up on the internet to understand their positions. The movie should have been entitled \\"The 13th Amendment\\" since it only depicted the last few months of Lincoln's life ensuring the passing of the amendment. I would recommend only renting the movie. It doesn't deserve purchasing.  It's not one of those historical films to look back on with any amount of excitement or respect. Not so good one this on Spielberg...next.
0312944926|2.0|I should have been tipped off in the first few pages when the author went on and on about how hardly anyone knew the NSA existed, but it wasn't until almost the end that -- in a fit of irritation and confusion -- I flipped to see when the book was written.  Everything about computers and national security has changed since 1998, including how much we as common people know and understand.  This leads to an infuriating number of times when you want to shake the main characters (who are supposedly geniuses) and shout at them.  The last few chapters were eye-rollingly predictable instead of suspenseful, taking the \\"best code breakers in the world\\" a good 10 pages to decode what I had figured out almost immediately (with no code breaking skills, just a high school knowledge of chemistry).  The \\"main bad guy\\" is predictable, but since it's Dan Brown that is to be expected.  His writing is formulaic and if you've picked up on his style already (which you should have, if you have read more than one of his books before) you'll know who the antagonist is within a few pages of them being introduced.<br /><br />If you want an edge-of-your-seat thriller, this is definitely not it.<br />If you want to check out Dan Brown, skip this disappointment.
B00BHU261S|5.0|No one could have done a better job then this director at capturing the feeling of a Hitchcock film. The dynamics of every character as they interacted with each other in front of the camera lens made the story real. Kudos to Anthony Hopkins on his portrayal of Hitch. I sometimes thought Mr. Hitchcock actually came to life just for this gig.<br /><br />A must see movie.
1400079144|3.0|Dan Brown spends so much time and effort talking about codes that he forgets that he can completely give away the ending with comments about the characters themselves.  I enjoyed reading about the Masons and ancient symbols and secret societies, but would have enjoyed it so much more if it hadn't been glaringly obvious who the antagonist was from almost the beginning of the book.<br />If you have ever been able to predict the ending of a book, you'll be able to predict this one.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Moved over from Google, really like Feedly. Different views and a niftty save feature. I'll be making the switch permanent. Give it a try.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|I love tim burton and johnny depp and helena bonham carter but this movie bombs. The storyline, character development, are so poorly executed. The movie had a lot of potential but just got TERRIBLE.<br /><br />Out of nowhere, the daughter is a werewolf? what? where did this come from?
B000LN7HUC|5.0|Good solo set. I've used one for years on my longer trips.<br /><br />I found that alcohol is more available than esbit or gas canisters, but not as light.<br /><br />You can get Methyl Alcohol at hardware stores, paint stores, and places like walmart. Trail towns usually have a place that sells it by the pint. Gas line dryer from a gas station will also work well. Isopropyl alcohol from the drug store burns, but with less heat.<br /><br />With Methyl Alcohol, an 2 cup boil with this kit uses about 0.6 oz of fuel.  10 oz in a light plastic bottle lasts me 5 days.  In contrast, a Jetboil 3.5 oz fuel canister lasts the same and weights 6.5 oz, and Esbit is 0.5 oz a tablet/boil for about 9 oz with packaging.<br /><br />If you plan on a long weekend trip, alcohol may not be the lightest choice, but if you are going to resupply, then the fuel is easier to find and thus lighter than carrying several canisters or several week's worth of tabs.  Lots of thru-hikers go the alcohol route.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|great acting. Same humor and jokes used just like in his other movies. The storyline had no direction. I watched it as mindless humor which it was. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann are great together but the story line and character development is junk.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book, the characters were amazing. I read a lot of reviews from people that said it wasn't that great so it took me along time to finally decide to give in but I'm do glad I did. The fighting from the characters was real and yes sometimes Abby held on to her anger for too long but that's real, we all do that. I can't wait to read the second book ( buying it now ).
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Movie is great entertainment and has great development. One complaint would be the ending just like any other horror movie. Great acting and directing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think (my opinion) that this is the BEST game EVER.1 because it's a tour.2 because it has cool people u can buy.And 3 is because it's FUN!!!
1608871452|5.0|This is the perfect book for any Supernatural fan! It's got all kinds of tidbits and goodies in it. The book itself is a lovely hardcover and beneath the dust jacket is a really pretty red/black color. The pictures are crisp and clear. And it's got all kinds of goodies tucked into. 2 envelopes of things and pictures 'taped' onto the pages as if it were some hunter's journal. I kinda wish those things were attached more gently so they could be removed since I've noticed add-ons like that have a tendency to tear over time, but otherwise. I love this book!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting! I play it every day and have a hard time putting it down,I LOVE THIS APP

1400069742|4.0|My congratulations to author Lynn Olson.  I thought I knew a good bit about the political mess pre-WWII.  Outline, yes.  Generalities about the main players such as Lindbergh, the isolationist senators, e.g, Wheeler, H. Johnson and Nye, among others and FDR, yes.  True, I knew Roosevelt was a conniver and isolationist Lindbergh was a Nazi sympathizer before the war and the strong Isolationist faction in Congress kept the people agitated and against a war.  But, as they say, \\"the devil is in the details.\\"<br /><br />Just to provide a few examples, the rise of \\"American Firster's\\" unleashed anti-Semitism in full, immigrant hatred and isolationism.  The fight against reinstating the draft was a direct attack on FDR.  Ann Lindbergh's later retreat from isolationism and resultant confusion was not atypical of what many Americans were going through. The 1940 presidential campaign was considered a national disgrace as Wilkie was driven by the party into the lowest corners of the GOP.  The push and pull between American factions was a sobering story of isolationism and anti-Semitism vs. Europe, vs. FDR.<br /><br />As 1941 developed, Lindbergh gave a major speech for America Firster's that was resoundingly Anti-Semetic.  While the White House purposely said nothing, the people and the media rose up and in effect 'booed down' the speech as a \\"national disgrace.\\"  The infighting continued, growing nastier, until Pearl Harbor.  \\"America First\\" shut its doors.  The war began in earnest.  That is another story.<br /><br />After the war, Olson returns to Lindbergh during his resurrection in society after FDR's passing.  He received many honors in the 1950's and 60's.  In the years before his death in 1974, he refused to recant any of his pre-war views.  \\"...he could not comprehend the radical evil of Nazism,\\"  said the NYTimes.  While Ann had an affair during these years, Lindbergh's disgrace returned with the discovery of his hidden German families in  2003.  Neither apparently knew about the other's affairs...<br /><br />This book could be retitled \\"Lindbergh, the Fight against American Intervention in WWII, 1939-41.  While there are other actors - FDR - other issues and American house-wrecking involved, this partial biography of Lindbergh - and its focus - is the core of the book.<br /><br />Recommended.new about the other's affairs...<br /><br />This book could be retitled \\"Lindbergh, the Fight against American Intervention in WWII, 1939-41.

B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik \\"Chava\\": Slow, boring, and for whatever great off-beat approach this movie pitched for some 'greater truth' and 'derailing our every day expectations of how characters interplay in a movie', it is SOOOO pretentious in its very energy and presentation, esp. with Philip Seymour Hoffman's character, I found it offensive. I was getting a bit nauseated from his forever odd stares into space that I was supposed to read 'into' somehow, lol. Meanwhile, I had to watch the characters around him act like they're in a different movie when he was holding court. I think Hoffman's character was primarily heavy and cloying, and the other actors acted like dissociated airheads in contrast. This is until Hoffman took off into 'seeming' dream sequences transforming into an airhead himself (some greater meaning for that contrast, I'm sorry I don't get it). I kept mentally nodding-off and tried to keep watching to justify the money I spent. DON'T BOTHER. Horrible! I actually can't stand the sight of Hoffman after seeing this movie. I saw the director/writer's intention to create a holocaust of 'either hate or love it' a mile away (I'm afraid that gambit now weighs in the favor of loathing it). I can say if this is about the advent of Scientology, it's a perfect homage.
096798467X|4.0|I was looking to make an outdoor oven and so bought this book for ideas.  It is an interesting book but the plans are much too detailed for what I would want.  After I received this book and looked through it, I did a search online and found a perfectly simple oven plan much more suited to what I wanted.  The book could be a useful reference and has some really interesting photos and diagrams.  Would I recommend it to others?  If they were really interested in building their own oven, or wanted ideas to have a craftsmant do it for them - yes.  Just for the information and background - likely.  It does have a lot of interesting material in it even if just for one who was curious as to how it was made.  For a general recommendation - no.  It really is a 'fit-the-niche' book.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Having heard of the movie but not having the opportunity to see it, I decided to read the so-called critically acclaimed book to see what all the fuss was about. What I found was a delightfully robust book about one man's religion, life, and survival. Although a work of fiction, the story is told from the vantage point of the author, Yann Martel, as he travels to an adult Pi' s house in Canada and records his magnificent story. Every few chapters, there is a snapshot of Pi in the \\"present\\" descriptions of his house and family which adds to the believability of the book. I have heard some criticism of the book saying that it takes too long to get into the action, which might be valid considering that the entire first half of the book is more of a biographical sketch than an action story; however the first half of the book is a gem in itself, setting up the story and introducing Pi' s religious beliefs. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a survivalist tale, and also has a vein of philosophy or religious studies running through their brain.

I now understand that it can be exactly what you want it to with the right partner.<br /><br />Extremely well written by exploring both of their inhibitions and how much were  they willing to risk to break their own rules to fulfill the lust the played between them both.

1932100660|4.0|That seems to be the key ingredient most people are missing here. Dr Campbell should be commended for initiating this very important discussion. And the evidence suggests that a Western meat-heavy, processed food diet will - in fact - lead to more disease, at an earlier stage in life.<br />But, the average resident of rural China or Vietnam, will happily eat Catfish, or Shrimp, or Chicken or Pork any chance they can get, even deep fried. If you look closely at human teeth, you will see that all of us have the teeth of omnivores. That is humans can (and do) eat virtually anything, including occasional meat if we were lucky. It's how we survived.<br /><br /> East Asians generally don't eat the quantities of meat, and processed food as Americans. The book notes that Asians have 1/17 the rates of heart disease that Americans have...but, they DO die of something around the same age as Americans! It may be stomach cancers, but they don't live to 200. In fact, their life expectancy is very similar, even though they don't have the levels of type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.<br /><br />  The other incredible thing is, the conclusions of the study are to promote a strict Vegan diet for Westerners, even though the Chinese themselves are usually not strictly Vegan. Was it simply a hunch to imagine that if a less meat and more greens are a good thing, that No meat, and ALL vegetables diet will be a great thing, and lead to extraordinary life spans? Were is the evidence to back up that hunch? The fact is, the human animal is designed to live to about 100 years tops, under any circumstances. You can tilt the balance somewhat in your favor for a more disease free longer life, but barring genetic engineering of some kind, that's the way it is. Something's going to get you by the century mark.
B001JU4S44|4.0|Folks I am a late comer to the Mission Impossible Movies, but this flick is what I call sophisticated action.  Anyone that says this movie doesn't deliver 5 stars on action is a complete tool.  My son and I have been watching all of the Mission Impossible movies together every Saturday, the director delivers in every scene.  From the moment Cruise arrives on the screen with this one you are not disappointed.  Cliff hanging, car chase, propelling down a skyscraper into it's ventallation system, motorcycle chase, to man vs. man.  I promise if you don't buckle up with this one you will be wishing you had an airbag!  Have fun!
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|This is the first time I've played a game on my new Kindle Fire.  It was a great way to spend a long afternoon.  I was surprised how vivid and colorful objects were on the Kindle screen and having the ability to enlarge a screen was helpful.  Play progression was uncomplicated and yet had some challenge.  It is a good style of game for a novice, like myself, but probably too simplistic for advanced gamers.  You definitely have to keep the power cord attached to be able to have the time to complete the game.

B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Yes it's violent and bloody, and yes, the \\"n\\" word is used liberally throughout the movie, but it's a Tarantino film taking place in pre-Civil War South for pete's sake. What would you expect?<br />All three leading actors were amazing. Fox & Waltz were insanely good. Beautifly shot and a compelling story that I was never quite sure how all would be resolved (other than knowing a bunch a folks were gonna die).<br />In honor of Roger Ebert, I give it two thumbs up. R.I.P. Mr. Ebert.

B0011UGLK6|5.0|Unaccustomed Earth is a collection of short stories by Jhumpa Lahiri.  I was first introduced to her after seeing the film adaptation of her debut novel, the Namesake.  Shortly afterwards, I tracked down the novel and loved it.<br /><br />The first part of the book includes 5 unconnected short stories told in the third person.  Each of these relates the experience of a Bengali-American of the 1.5 generation (born in the US of immigrant parents).  Although each story deals with different themes, timelines, locations, and characters, there are a lot of commonalities.  The main characters, generally thirtysomethings, are still struggling to find a place in American society and understand how to relate to their traditions.<br /><br />The second half of the book is a series of stories about two characters, told alternately from their points of view and from a kind of God's eye view, who are introduced as children through their parents' friendship, and then meet again by chance as adults during critical decision points in their lives.<br /><br />Unlike many short story writers, who succeed at setting the stage for a series of events, Lahiri's stories are very much about the characters.  She is one of the rare authors who has the ability to transfer her characters emotions directly to her reader.  You will feel their losses along with their joys.  Even though many of the stories are sad, the impact is quite cathartic, and you won't feel burdened after reading.  Although Lahiri writes about a specific cultural group, her stories are accessible to a wider audience.  And, while this isn't a collection of mysteries by any stretch of the imagination, Lahiri manages to avoid the pitfalls of predictability, so that each story unfolds in ways you wouldn't have imagined.

On one hand it saying introverts are just as worthwhile as extroverts but then it appears to give tips on how to appear more extrovert.  I guess as an introverted adult I thought I'd get more out of it personally but I didn't.

So Jeff had her meet us - what a wonderful delight!<br /><br />And to watch Julie and her patient husband work together putting up a French cooking idea based on ideas for Julia Childs makes the whole story lots of fun.  So I can't recommend this book or the DVD show too highly!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Starts off quite easy with a good tuition section. Soon becomes quite hard but very addictive. As you play it more you start to pick up short cuts to make life easier. Never gets boring.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is my favorite show after &#34;24.&#34; The characters are so good in their performance it is as if you know them and you are actually there. BTW, Masterpiece Theater is one of the few jewels on television.
B008220DIC|5.0|Saw \\"The Master\\" by Paul Anderson Thomas, a few days ago and this film leaves many lingering thoughts afterward, very interesting and a good artistic and technical(camera) work, if there was a director showing off his talent. I can now see why it didn't wasn't even nominated for an Oscar(head and shoulder better picture than Bigalow's ThirtyDarkZero or Argo, also clearly better than the other junk in that category) and Phoenix's performance was unbelievably excellent and manic. Should have won it in my opinion. I will admit however that it was hard to watch it or get through this film, very uncompromising story with some very sexual embarrassing and uncomfortable scenes, but the scenes were necessary to illustrate the psychological mind and going \\"ons\\" of Freddie Quelle(Joaquin Phoenix) the main character in this film. Also the beautiful Amy Adams, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Dern all gave superb jaw dropping performances, some of the best talent in Hollywood. In terms of simple psychology Freddie Quelle is the animalistic Ego in this story, and Lancaster Dodd(Hoffman) the Super Ego, and Mrs. Dodd(Adams) is the Id, a very dominant Id. However there is a bigger story unraveling around a smaller story of this Freddie Quelle, he is a ex-navy post WW2 veteran and alcoholic who drinks paint thinner for fun, wondering around lost and adrift in a world he does not fit in. Before he run into this charismantic religious/cult figure of Dodd, which he connects with. I will recommend this to those who enjoy thought-provoking films or a character study, but if you are the type that only enjoys transformer types of movies or if you're a fanboy of comicbook movies then you should stay away from this one. It clearly requires intellect and maturity to fully comprehend this one, because it will escape you and leave you perplexed.
B008476HBM|5.0|Written with all the grace and charm of the time period. The book gives many of the characters quirks and perspectives left out  of the films. A great read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read this because the kids loved the books. Now I love the books too.<br />Five more words required for my review
B009HSPODE|4.0|Plots that plumb ubiquitous, but often neglected areas of human experience.  Characters deftly and indelibly created and scenes effortlessly set.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|fantstic movie I wasnt sure about it at first but ended up being a great movie love it very much
B0081L391C|4.0|The more I watch this movie, the funnier I think it is. It just cracks me up.<br />My teenage boys love it, too.....maybe hearing them laugh hysterically just adds to the pleasure for me.<br />I am looking forward to the sequel.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly gives us Harry Bosch at the top of his game. An intricate web of clues brought together by the Black Box moment in the investigative process.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|It is sick barman emissions God yo mom  poop man shush HD he goes hue HD he hobo your true
1451673442|5.0|I love all of her DVD's and books of the secrets. You will be amazed by her books and teachings.
1423140605|3.0|To be clear, the book isn't badly written per se; it's rather that Riordan depends entirely too much on deus ex machina and some ridiculous coincidences. The plot is weakening here, and some of the characters' actions are borderline stupid. One would think that Percy would mature, but he actually devolves from previous books. The quality of prose is solidly mediocre, and at times one feels Riordan is only introducing some characters for the sake of name-dropping. Oh well. It's okay. I'll hope for better in the next iteration.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|Yes, I am a fan of his last two CD's but not this one. I only like one song from this CD which features Timberland whom I love. I love Timberlands style, unique voice and his back up singing and no I am not African American. I am half white and half Asian. Thought you should know that Justin and Timberlands music reaches across all ages and race.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I like the dragons in the game.  The islands that you can get are cool.  I like that it has legendary dragons in it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book touches your heart and makes u believe that with the worst circumstances, finding love is still possible. BUY IT!
B003XT603Q|5.0|Read the book before the movie. Prefer the book. Interesting characters. If this is autobiographical, the author sounded pretty honest.
B004PHSTY8|5.0|At first blush, Supernatural is something like a 'weekly horror movie meets great American road trip' set to classic rock. Then the layers begin to peel away and you learn that this show is truly about family and the trials therein. Great stories, great casting, interesting sets, and great character development over the course of the show's (as of this writeup) 8 series.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I saw this movie in 3d at the movie theatre and liked it. So I thought it would be nice to have it at home in 3d. Great Movie!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Not much else to say. It's free and pretty deep. Anybody looking to scratch their Operation Genesis itch (or just for a good JP game) should definitely get this.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|It's amazing after all these years The Stones keep bringing it on.  Some of the songs I don't remember and I know some of the songs are new.  Great album to have.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|Now, this works as expected on typical Gingerbread / A8 processor, and the quirky Ice Cream Sandwich / A10 processor. However, perhaps some of you may still have one of the older tablets, and I do use my Cruz T301 a lot, and it works on it!  Now the key presses seem to be a little bit sluggish on it, but the calculations seem to be fast.<br /><br />What I should have put in the title and then I wouldn't have to written any review is that it can be transferred to the SD card -- a huge plus!!! It apparently writes to the SD card at least some of your last results, so your work isn't lost when you turn off the tablet.<br /><br />Now you can see I'm bubbling over with enthusiasm for this product, why didn't give it a 5 star rating? It has so many features, it's like several calculators in one.  I really just scratched the surface what it is suppose to do.  So, I'll leave it to others who have used more of it's functions to tell you if this app behaves like it should with those.  It does just seem to be a well laid out, thought out app -- which doesn't blow my old tablet up.  I can use more of those.
B000NY17J6|5.0|I love this double album. I had volume 1 and it was cheaper to purchase this Vol. 1 & 2. Linda Ronstadt is great and this is a wonderful album to have.  I'm glad I got it.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Guys put together a decent group of songs,  well played, good lyrics overall enjoyed it.  Nothing else to say, it was fine, it was interesting, enjoyable,
B000002LAC|5.0|These three woman together are fantastic.  Their harmony is wonderful. I purchased both Trio albums and am enjoying them very much. They are so good together.
B0088NPFPQ|4.0|I recieved this fairly quickly in the condition it was described.  I love this series and was grateful to find it at a reasonable price as I am updating the movies I have to a blu-ray collection!
B005LAIIHG|2.0|[[ASIN:B005LAIIHG Life of Pi]]<br /><br />My husband and I just didn't like this movie, \\"Life of Pi\\".  However, we have really liked all other Ang Lee films.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" was too self-conscious..................you always got the feeling that the film makers were saying something like, \\"look how artsy we are to be taking this (not) provocative subject matter...........and using beautiful colors and sound, we can convince the audience to go along with anything.\\"  The plot was boring and tedious and we couldn't wait for it to finish.  Perhaps, it was the influence from Bollywood...............Ang Lee, on his own is wonderful............but this film sank like a rock, for us.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this cd--it has some lively, lovely tunes to work by or just listen to. You will love it, too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game very addict I play it everyday. Sometimes. I have to hide my kindle from my grandbaby because. She loves it to
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I found myself fascinated with the world Lauren Oliver created. Each previous book ended with a gut renching surprise, so I was pleased with how the story continued to evolve and bring closure during this last book. Read the whole series...you don't be disappointed.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Fascinating plot, but for me, a little too much of the battle scene action stuff.  I was disappointed that the book ended without fully settling several questions, but after some thought, Oliver was smart to leave off where she did.  A small group of committed rebels had achieved some gains but whether they will succeed in overthrowing a corrupt government is left undecided.  Oliver is a good writer and has a great imagination.  Her characters are well-imagined.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|A true classic. One of the funniest movies around from the`screwball` comedy era. I`m just adding it to my DVD collection.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Ive tried a few different of these transmitters from dept stores and would say this one is easily the best one. For all those saying it doesnt save the spot you left off then your not reading the manual! It has a book mark feature on it that will save your spot and return to it once it has power again. The transmitter has a ton a features that no other transmitters do. You'll still get a bit of static now and then and I dont believe the highs come through as you would off any other source but if your not wanting to replace your car stereo this is a great alternative.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play the game with  my son and a family friend. I look forward to the latest game every day.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Best show of its type ever. Ian Richardson best actor in a series I have ever seen. Watch episode one, then watch episode one of  the Kevin Spacy version of  House of Cards, etc. etc. Grumpy from Carmel, Ca
B007UXSKMU|5.0|Good story. Another spy movie. Action-packed like \\"James Bond\\" movies, such as \\"Golden Eye\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", or others like \\"War of the Worlds\\" etc.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my daughter likes it. very nice game. friendly for children. games from natural motion are all nice. more games like this.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Loved history and historical figures.  Enjoyed reading about Abraham Lincoln and his contemporaries.  Renewed my respect for a good man who did great things.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Had this on my ipad for a minute before reading because i was so anxiously awaiting on Reckless to come out...so sad i waited. I feel like this book was very well written. This is the first book by Colleenn Hoover that i've read and i will definitely be reading more. This book really took me by surprise with the turn of events....and am in loveee with how cute Holder and Sky are. Their relationship is just adorable all together.Ill probably read this ten times before Losing Hope comes out in july.....i cant wait!
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Love the writing of Emily Bronte.  Enjoying my purchase, was not disappointed.  Loved the ease and quickness of ordering it.
B0087EACJK|5.0|A true running platform puzzler. Simple and elegant design that progressively gets tougher and tougher. I first found continuity on Kongregate and loved it there and instantly picked this one up when I saw the chance. You run your stickman through the various screens by sliding screens about the display so they will match. You search for coins, switches and eventually the correct order of tiles to get stickman through the door. The only thing I do not like about the game is the timed feature. I do not have the patience to go back and run every puzzle again until I get the time under the game's \\"par\\". I will pick up every coin, but that is about as far as my patience goes. This is well worth your time and purchase.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|Read this book in High School and had lost the book.  I look forward to re-reading it and was very excited to have seen it on Amazon.  So convenient for me to have on my Kindle.  I love Amazon and the wide selection of great and marvelous literary treasures.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This story while sad was very interesting and surprisingly well written. Jaycee is a remarkable young woman who has overcome unimaginably disturbing events.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|Purchased it as a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law to finish her collection.  She was thrilled to get it as it was one of her favorite t.v. shows.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|'The native PDF reader that comes with Kindle Fire HD does not display Vietnamese characters correctly.  This app solves that problem. In addition, it has features that makes it easier to read PDF documents. Thanks Adobe to maintain the  PDF portability intent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|ive never had so much fun lol this game is amazing!!! :D perfect lol and its free and addicting like temple run hahah kids love it!!!!
0887431453|5.0|I am excited that my 3 year old likes this book and is working with it.  Of course I do it with her, but it is great to go over things she is already learning.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Not for hard use in a tactical/survival situation . Will work for everyday use for lighter duty . Light , accurate and dependable .
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good plot twist at the end. Page turner, classic of J Grisham. A fantastic novel for a lazy weekend on the beach!
B00A757EFW|5.0|i am 63 and loved it when it first came out and still today<br />it 's lots of fun and exciting,<br />i also have friends my age and younger, or older and still play games wish atari was still around i really enjoyed it.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|The writing is choppy for me. At first, the switching back and forth between different characters was interesting. However, when Albom did not start reveal the point of this or when he did, I was losing interest of what he had to say. I did not finish the book as there were other books that I was reading that was more engaging. It could have been a good book but I did not find the normal &#34;flow&#34; and engagement of his previous books &#34;Five People You Met in Heaven&#34;.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|so he got me into it its fun and cute i like it  at first i felt like it was for 2yr. olds, but anyone who still lets that little kid<br />out now and again can enjoy it no matter the age
B008602KQI|5.0|fantastic movie .. combines elements of futuristic sci-fi and gladiator rome .. watch it you wont regret<br />its a must see movie
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Other reviews have pretty much said it all, but I'm posting this partly to offset a 1-star review by someone who clearly did not read the book.<br /><br />I have been following this plan 5 weeks and the benefits I see are incremental, cumulative, and both physical & psychological. I have lost a couple of pounds but don't see me becoming too thin any time soon, so plan to stay on it indefinitely. I have come to view the &#34;fasting&#34; days as sort of a physical version of a vacation from work or a spiritual retreat - a chance for my body to rest & recharge on a handful of carefully selected foods.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My six and nine year old girls love this game! I love that it's not demanding actual money to have fun playing! Great fun!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Now the big wait for the second and third episodes. It is great that Amazon Prime now has some nearly first-run movies.
B0006GVJEE|1.0|FIRST DVD  HAD  SOUND AT BEGINNING  THEN AFTER YA  PUSHED PLAY  THERE WAS NO SOUND,THEY  SENT ME ANOTHER DVD  AND  LO AN D BEHOLD  SAME  HAPPENED AGAIN BUT,THEY ARE  REFUNDING MY MONEY...ITS  JUST  EVIDENTALLY THEY PURCHASED A BAD  BUNCH OF  THESE  DVDS.......GLAD  THEY ARE  REFUNDING MY MONEY  SHOWS  THEY  KNOW  MISTAKES CAN BE MADE AND  THAT THEY ARE  WILLING TO  COMPROMISE  AND MAKE  GOOD  ANY  FAULTY DVDS
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. It helps me find cool new ideas that I. haven't ever thought of before. Pinterest rocks!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like that I don't need to hunt down a calculator just to do calculations for thing I am already working on, on my kindle
B0094BB4TW|5.0|With the previous version I had trouble closing pictures after viewing them from the news feed.  This is now resolved and I can enjoy Facebook from my Kindle.  Everything seems to load faster too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book has the perfect ending for the hunger games series. Even though some parts are sad and unexpected it's what makes the stories good. I still can't believe it is over!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I came to the books by way of the HBO series, and I especially enjoyed Books 1-3.  This was a compelling read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great app that keeps my mind thinking (good for a guy my age) and it's fun. Highly recommend for anyone who seeks to stay sharp.
0956010903|5.0|Limited edition is completely worth the price.  Beautiful leather book with smaller fake jewel encrusted beetle the bard book.  Must buy

B009AVCAJ4|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It is okay in bluray, however aspect ratio is 4:3.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love it, after my sister recommend it, I had a lot of fun, and I recommend it to any one is a fun way to spend time, either your waiting in a doctor's office or any other place, or just to relax at home, the only thing that might get annoying is the music but if that happened just turn down the volume
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Well, I am a horseback rider and do jumps. This app makes me feel like I am almost with my horse! It is great.
B003PIS5XI|5.0|This is a gem of a movie.  It shows how life is living in a trailer park for a teenage boy and his desire to be in his fantasy world with his video game that just came to life with the opportunity to live in that world beyond his wildest dreams with his girlfriend.  I love the special effects and the subtle humor in the story in the characters.  This is a wonderful family movie and a must to see for anyone who enjoys a wild ride into a world of fantasy with a touch of reality.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Although this isn't the best gaming app I've played it is by far one of the top ones. I've got to admit that the fact that this is free makes up for any parts that seem mediocre.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game of solitaire much better than windows and the price was right the graphics excellent the game play fast  and that it was good
B0017VG66I|5.0|I'm sorry, John Wayne just seemed to be doing his john wayne schtick in this movie and his character was SUCH a Dufus! This may be listed as a classic, but The Quiet Man, The Shootist, She wore a Yellow Ribbon, are all standing head and shoulers above &#34;Liberty&#34;.<br /><br />Shane is/was/will always be a super movie.  You know how the movie ends, and I like that- but I think it is perfect that you don't know how Shane ends.  Does he live, does he die, does he ever find the peace he is looking for?<br /><br />I've been ready for the sequel for 60 years.  Shane make the duo of movies easily worth the price!
B00AAU7AI0|4.0|Paulo explaine beautifully, how can the river ,  flower spread happiness just being themselves .. be yourself is a powerful take away ..
B000092ZYX|5.0|HAIL TO THE THIEF IS ONE OF FAVORITE RADIOHEAD ALBUMS USUALLY FOR SOME BANDS THAT EVENTUALLY EXPERIMENT THAT MEANS A OHH OHH AND RADIOHEAD COMPLETELY LETTING ME DOWN ON THEIR PREVIOUS RELEASES THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED AS A FAN. \\"AMNESIAC\\" AND \\"KID A\\" WERE SUCH LET DOWNS FOR ME THAT I WAS STARTING TO THINK RADIOHEAD WENT FROM BEING ONE OF GREATEST BANDS TO ONE OF THOSE BANDS THAT WERE GREAT AND LATER WENT DOWN HILL. HAIL TO THE THIEF IS PERFECT AND THE MOST ENJOYABLE RELEASE FROM ONE OF THE GREATEST BANDS OF OUR TIME.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|it is a good game to  get you thinking outside the box. I usually don't play these kind of  games but this one I enjoy
B00004XONN|2.0|I DON'T KNOW WHY RADIOHEAD GOT SUCH PRAISE FOR THIS ALBUM, THE ENTIRE CD TO SEEMS LIKE SILENCE AND IS VERY DRAGGED OUT AND SIMPLY BORING AND YOU SEEK FOR MUSIC BUT YOU CANT SEEM TO FIND IT. IT IS PROBABLY THEIR WORST ALBUM IN MY OPINION, EITHER THIS OR AMNESIAC. SKIP THIS RELEASE. DON'T LISTEN TO THE PRAISE OF THIS ALBUM.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is fun and interesting because you get 3 choices to draw and you get to guess their picture!!!!!! I love it!
B004NSULHM|2.0|KING OF LIMBS IS RADIOHEAD'S NEW ALBUM AUTOMATICALLY I GET EXCITED FOR A NEW RELEASE FROM MY FAVORITE BANDS, AND RADIOHEAD BEING ONE OF COURSE I HAD TO GET IT. FROM THE FIRST LISTEN YOUR NOT SURE IF YOUR GONNA LIKE THIS ALBUM THE QUIET GLOOMY SOUND OF THE RECORD IS SOMETHING YOU LOVE ABOUT LATER RADIOHEAD BUT IN THIS ALBUM RADIOHEAD DOESN'T QUITE DO THAT INSTEAD IT LET ME DOWN WONDERING IF ITS 10 DIFFERENT SONGS OR ONE LONG SONG WHICH IS HOW KING OF LIMBS SOUNDS LIKE. THE ONLY SONG THAT GAVE IT SOME LIFE IS THE SINGLE \\"LOTUS FLOWER\\" THE REST IS JUST BLAH.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good book I would recommend book to all my friends.  Couldn't put the book down.  It had everything u could want in a book.
B000002UR7|5.0|IT COULD JUST BE ME OR MY PERSONAL TASTE OR LOVE FOR 90'S ROCK MUSIC. BUT PABLO HONEY IS A GREAT DEBUT, OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO NOT LIKE IT OR EVEN SOME CRITICS SEEM TO DISS THE ALBUM AND EVEN THOM YORKE SEEMS TOO. BUT TO ME PABLO HONEY IS ONE OF ROCKS GREATEST ALBUMS I STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THIS ALBUM AND REMEMBER GOING BACK TO TRACK ONE AND LISTEN TO THE ALBUM OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND ONE SONG BEING A FAVORITE OF MINE \\"STOP WHISPERING\\" AND THINKING TO MYSELF IM GOING TO START A BAND AND SOUND JUST LIKE THIS OF COURSE THAT NEVER HAPPENED BUT THE POINT IS PABLO HONEY CHANGED MY LIFE AND MY TASTE FOR MUSIC AND WELL INTRODUCED ME TO THIS GREAT ROCK BAND. PABLO HONEY IS A MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever this game is actually a lot dinner than temple run what's nice about it I'd that you can buy new characters.

B006LRUVUA|1.0|I was not able to use it like I thought, I un-installed the product and would not recommend it to anyone.
B000002TQV|5.0|RADIOHEAD THE BENDS IS THE BAND AT THEIR HIGHEST PEEK THE GRUNGY GUITARS AND HAUNTING VOCALS OF THOM YORKE. THE BENDS IS ONE ALBUM THAT REPRESENTS THE 90'S. I AM A BIG FAN OF 90'S MUSIC SCENE THE GRUNGE, THE BRITPOP, ALTERNATIVE, IT WAS A GREAT DECADE FOR ROCK MUSIC, AND THIS AND THEIR DEBUT \\"PABLO HONEY\\" ARE SOME OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS OF THE 90S. THE BENDS INCLUDES SOME OF RADIOHEADS BEST SONGS \\"STREET SPIRIT FADE OUT\\" , \\"HIGH AND DRY\\" , \\"FAKE PLASTIC TREES\\", \\"MY IRON LUNG\\", AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE \\"NICE DREAM\\". THE BENDS IS TRULY ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF THE 90'S IF NOT IN THE PAST 2 DECADES.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was good and filled what I was looking for in a book. It will keep dragging you in so watch out!
B000002UJQ|3.0|OK COMPUTER ONE OF RADIOHEAD'S HIGH POINTS IN THEIR CAREER THIS IS THE ALBUM THAT SET THEM OFF AS 90S ROCK PIONEERS WHY? NOT TOO SURE.. SURE OK COMPUTER HAS SOME OF THE BANDS BEST SONGS AND WELL KNOWN SONGS BUT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN IT IS THEIR BEST ALBUM. OK COMPUTER IS WELL AN OK ALBUM.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I like how the app is  FREE  and fun and 3D but I don't like how you pay for stuff  with real money and if you don't pay for the stuff then you can never upgrade to get some more pets but it is EXSPENSIVE for example: to purchase 20 virtual dollars it cost 90 real dollars is that EXSPENSIVE or what?!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Keeps you entertained the entire time. I could not put it down. Wonderfully written. The story line is so interesting...just when you think you've figured it out...  another twist.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I loved the ease with which I purchased it. I watched it immediately. Excellent movie but I recommend you watch with the closed caption on because sometimes it was hard to follow the dialogue.
B005FFW46S|5.0|And Sir Terry Pratchett never fails to deliver with the adventures of His Grace and Blackboard Monitorship, the Duke of Ankh-Morpork.  This is another Discworld tale you'll want to read again and again.
B0038P59A0|2.0|Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law are tolerable as Holmes and Watson, but the Irene Adler role for Rachel McAdams is worthless. Why do directors feel it necessary to heavily feature a character who was in only one of the original sixty stories? Villain Mark Strong is way over the top here; the only thing he succeeds at doing is looking like Andy Garcia's fat cousin.<br /><br />The film itself? Mediocre theater trash. There's about 1000% more fighting in this 2-hour film than in the entire Holmes canon. And the CGI is very obvious and at times very, very bad. I can't imagine wanting to watch this a second time, let alone owning it on DVD. It's not the worst film I have ever seen--the Will Smith reboot of [[ASIN:B003NS5L8W Wild Wild West]] takes that cake for recent big budget disasters--but nor is this Sherlock even the faintest patch on the giants of the genre, for example, the Granada [[ASIN:B000060MVK production]] starring Jeremy Brett. Conversely, this Guy Ritchie Steampunk-on-Steroids would barely be recognizable as Sherlock Holmes if not for all the name-dropping and the constant shots of \\"221B\\".<br /><br />For a truly modern take on the great detective--in both senses of the word--look no further than the Cumberbatch-Freeman masterpiece (BBC's [[ASIN:B004132HZS Sherlock]]), currently in production for its third season.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is pretty fun. reminds me of the horse game at espn zone at disneyland where you have to care for your horse. interesting so far
B006RXQDH8|5.0|I watched this last night with my 17 year old son and 15 year old daughter.  Yes, it is a very violent revenge movie, but oddly it is a comedy, part comic book, part Japanese Yakuza hidden dragon crouching dragon scenes.  It is very fun, unusual, unique and very entertaining.  Quentin Tarantino movies are not like anything else.  They don't follow your typical formula.  With Tarantino, you never know what is going to happen.  Everyone really liked it.  With the exception of the large cell phones, it is not dated at all.  It has a great cast.  Lucy Lui as \\"O-Ren Ishii\\" a part japanese, part chinese american, is fantastic.  Uma Thurman as \\"the bride\\" is great.  Daryl Hannah has a small role that is great.<br />Julie Dreyfus had a role as \\"Sofie Fatale\\" and I did not even recognize her until I googled it later.  I highly recommend it.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|These 2 make a great pair loved the movie makes ya laugh and Jack provides that in this movie! I recommend watching it at least once.

1439102813|5.0|Imagine standing in your living room paralyzed by the fear of not knowing which way to turn for the bathroom; or, worse yet, sitting across from someone you don't know at the dinner table and having her tell you she's your daughter.<br /><br />This first novel of Lisa Genova delves into the world of early-onset Alzheimer's with a compelling, yet often humorous, story line that keeps you turning the pages as it educates you to the perils of a terrifying and mysterious disease.<br /><br />We follow the life of 50-year-old Alice Howland as she struggles with a pervading forgetfulness that invades her personal life and threatens to derail her career.

It's a tale that may give you the heebie-jeebies, but I guarantee it will change your life!
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I have been fan of all mission impossible series, since they were just TV series.  I have watched all the TV series and it's amazing to see how technology has advanced in the film business over time.  This one is also great, but the special effects were a little too phony and hard to believe.  This time there was lot of commercial for Apple products.  Overall, a great fun movie.
B003OAL58E|5.0|Shot in austere black-and-white, THE WHITE RIBBON sets up several expectations only to frustrate them deliberately.  The action takes place in a small village just before the outbreak of World War I; a prelapsarian community in which everyone knows everyone else, motorized vehicles do not exist, making travel difficult, if not impossible.  Beneath the idealized surface lurk palpable tensions: children are abused, families are at war with one another, and class-differences continually cause tension.  Matters come to a head with a horrific crime in which one of the children - who has learning difficulties - has his eyes put out.  Director Haneke is far more interested in character and situation rather than plot: the film actively refuses to tell us who perpetrated the crime.  Rather we are drawn into a lost world - one that was destroyed by the onset of the First World War - which prided itself on its stability, but refused to acknowledge tensions lurking within it.  The action is consciously slow-paced, with long takes in which the actors are seen moving - often very slowly - within the frame.  By such means Haneke forces us to concentrate on the characters; their facial interactions and their relationship to one another.  THE WHITE RIBBON is an intense film demanding our full attention: occasionally horrific, it is a vivid portrait of a physically and mentally incestuous community at war with itself. Highly recommended.

1592407889|3.0|This book reads like a thriller...almost fiction.  Some of the stories Ms. Parker tells seem almost unreal.  Somehow everything she describes in her early childhood/teen years doesn't ring true, although why would she lie?  I can't quite grasp why she wrote this 'tell all'.  It certainly is depressing.  Did she do this to spite her mother, for fame, for money or all three?  I doubt if she had a good relationship with her mother and her mother was going to figure her in her will would she write a book like this.  The stories of her meetings with the prostitute and other people who 'saved' her at the right moment are really difficult to swallow.  Her dealings with that Doctor from Chicago is very eerie.  I rather enjoyed hearing about her years as a flight attendant i.e stewardess in those days.<br />It seems to me Ms. Parker is still very disturbed, and with her up bringing, who wouldn't be? That is if her up bringing is to be believed.  In a way Ms. MacLaine did the right thing in having her go out on her own to make her own way and not be a spoiled movie stars off spring.  I do, however, think she made a big mistake in not sending her to college.  Just about any parent who could afford it does this.  Certainly Ms. MacLaine could afford it.<br />As for the acting thing...well....not every child of an actor can be an actor themselves.  Some just don't have that talent. Some do.  Apparently Ms. Parker didn't.  She should have just gone on with her life instead of going thru so much anger.<br />I do hope Ms. Parker is still in therapy.  Looks like she needs it.  I found it interesting that she makes no mention of her divorce.  When did that happen and why.  Also strange that her son is in boarding school!!!  If she really wanted to by pass her mother's mistakes, keep the kid home for heaven sake.<br />LUCKY ME doesn't seem so lucky to me.  Rather, UNLUCKY ME.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thought this was a very interesting book.  Well written.  I'm not one who tolerates a lousy read and have purchased a number of what turn out to be half-read disappointments.  Not this book.  It's good!  I was ambivalent when I purchased it given some of the negative reviews, but I can say that it has proven to be one of my favorites.

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The Dark Knight Rises had the misfortune of being the follow up to one of if not the best movie of the millennium up to this point. Does it live up to the hype? Of course not that would be near impossible, but it comes closer than anyone would have thought.<br /><br />  My problems with this movie are a mixed bag of  lack of development, plot holes, Hollywood superhero movie cliches, and a disappointing ending. The biggest lack of development is when the city is under Bane's control for what is said to be months but only feels like a few days at most. Instead of the few minutes we see of riots it would have been better if we were shown the anarchy and self destruction of Gotham that was Bane's ultimate goal and the months of uncertainty and fear that they created. This movie is full of plot holes, from characters knowing Bruce Wayne's secret without any explanation to Bruce's ability to find a cafe without ever being told the name of that cafe. One glaring plot hole is Bruce Wayne's ability to travel from a desert in a undisclosed foreign nation, into the heavily guarded city of Gotham without any money or equipment. This plot hole is undercut by the Superhero cliche that is the fact that the superhero is capable of anything. If you were to ask somebody how Bruce Wayne was able to get to Gotham their inevitable answer would be \\"He's Batman.\\" as if that constitutes a rational explanation. Another dreadful superhero cliche is Catwoman played by Ann Hathaway. A small hot woman who can beat up waves of large muscular men. To be clear I'm not saying that women can not be tough. I am simply saying that this specific petite woman with no muscle tone would not be able physically best these larger men because, due to her lack of muscle, her punches, kicks, or any other form of attack simply wouldn't hurt. And the biggest Hollywood cliche of them all, when the hero is about to be killed by the villain someone bursts though the wall and saves him. This is usually preceded by the villain stalling by going into a overly lengthy speech about killing the hero instead of actually doing it. The worst disappointment of this movie is the ending. Without spoiling anything with to much detail i'll just say the whole movie builds to Bruce Wayne doing something and then when it finally comes time for him to do it he doesn't and instead the movie gives us more of that \\"He's Batman, he can do anything\\" junk.<br /><br />  Even with all the problems in this movie it still manages to be great. First of all the acting is top notch. Christian Bale is once again great as his humble Bruce Wayne and his grandiose alter ego and Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman all repeat their convincing and grounded roles as Bruce's support. Among the newcomers is Tom Hardy as Bane, the main villain of the movie. Bane does a great job as the character giving him an assertive and menacing feel. Bane's voice might sometimes be hard to understand but those occasions are far and few between and when you can understand him it is terrifying and effective. Another newcomer is Ann Hathaway who gives a surprisingly good performance and shows a level of acting she has never shown before. The last major newcomer is the rising star Joseph Gordon-Levitt with a great performance as an orphan turned cop with similar ideas and beliefs as Bruce Wayne had when he first decided to fight crime. The greatness of the acting in this movie is due to the same reason that the acting has been so great throughout the trilogy, everyone takes it seriously. None of the actors succumb to the temptation to act as if they are  characters in a comic book movie like Jim Carrey and Jack Nicholson had in the past. This is essential to giving the movie it's realistic feel and making all of us watching believe that given the right circumstances this could all really happen.<br /><br />  The other reason that all this movie's problems can be so easily forgiven is it contains some of the greatest and most epic set pieces to ever grace the silver screen. Christopher Nolan is not a Michael Bay over the top action director but instead he is an intimidate filmmaker of taste. From the simplest fight scene between Batman and Bane in a sewer to the jaw dropping scene during a football game Christopher Nolan's directing, mixed with a great score score by Hans Zimmer, creates scenes that will stick with you and cast a giant shadow over the movies faults.<br /><br />  This movie is riddled with plot holes and annoying cliche scenes and yet manages to be a satisfying conclusion even if the movies own conclusion isn't so satisfying. People say that it's unfair to compare this movie to The Dark Knight and should only be judged own its own. But it's only natural to compare the two considering they are part of the same trilogy and share three quarters of their name. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, a once in a lifetime kind of thing. The Dark Knight Rises is a great superhero movie while the The Dark Knight is simply a great movie. In conclusion The Dark Knight Rises lacks the near perfection of it's predecessor but is still a great and memorable conclusion to one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time.

B003VANOFY|2.0|When I bought this headset I was expecting high quality; not just based on the price, but because Logitech has never let me down. I was very, very wrong.<br /><br />First of all, the drivers hardly ever work. I use these at night, so I have them unplugged during the day while I use my regular speakers. At night, I have them set as my default headset, so I plug them in and the computer goes straight to them. Half the time the drivers won't pick the device up correctly, and will leave my computer speakers on, while also having the headset detected. It will also shut down the headset at random times, even though it's fully charged, or even plugged in.<br /><br />The surround sound feature will decide to stop working sometimes at well. I will plug in the headset, and the switch does nothing. I have to restart the software to get it to work again. Speaking of which: The software crashed constantly, and I'm using the most up to date version. For almost $100 you'd think you wouldn't have to put up with this. Wishing I would have went with a different brand.<br /><br />The sound is decent enough.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I have been on this diet since August 2012 and lost over 35 lbs while still enjoying reasonable portions of foods such as pizzas, burritos, or ramen. I was skeptical when I first read about this diet after stumbling across it on the BBC website. Eat only 600 calories a day for two days out of the week?  Still, it was time for a change. Despite attempting to eat right every day, continuous grazing on food to supposedly boost my metabolism, and regular gym workouts, I had gained fat until I was at 214 lbs (and I'm 5'8). Plus, a doctor's visit showed me I was suffering from high cholesterol and high blood pressure.<br /><br />So I decided to give this diet a try for at least a week. Breakfast was scrambled eggs with slices of chicken breast, and then I anxiously waited for dinner. My stomach began rumbling by 12:00 pm, but the hunger subsided after I downed a cup of black coffee. I did feel a bit weak, but keeping busy and more coffee helped me make it to a dinner. This was a revelation - I would not die from a day without food!<br /><br />Interestingly, the next day I did not feel as hungry as I thought I would be. I then realized this was a plan I could do for the long-term. I downloaded the MyFitnessPal app to keep track of calories, and still ate what I wanted on non-fast days, but in reasonable portions. Dr. Michael Mosley advises high protein, low glycemic index foods on fast days, but I took it further and reduced sugars and starches, and boosted my intake of green vegetables even on most non-fasting days. I continued working out when fasting, and noticed that my running stamina improved markedly.<br /><br />Much of what Dr. Mosley writes in The Fast Diet mirrored my personal experience. For example, hunger does diminish after a few weeks of intermittent fasting. As this book notes, this diet will lead to long-term changes toward food. Well, I looked forward to eating green veggies and avoiding decadent foods on days I could eat normally. I still eat junk food,but only when I am hungry, not bored.  Although the Fast Diet focuses on two meals each fasting day, I would eat one large dinner because a single meal was more satisfying than several small ones.<br /><br />This book also suggests getting support from family and friends. Unfortunately, I did not tell others about my diet because it had not made its way to the U.S. When I first did reveal my fasting, I was bombarded with well-meaning advice on how it was a dangerous fad diet. So instead, I joined a Facebook group of Alternate Day Fasters who were mostly from the UK. This group was so helpful for advice and support.<br /><br />Soon, my pants began sagging off my waist and others were asking me if I was losing weight. I went to the doctor in early December and weighed in at 184 lbs, about a 30 lb loss in just four months! And my cholesterol and blood pressure had reduced to reasonable levels. The doctor told me to stop losing weight, since I had more muscle than average, so I could disregard the BMI or height-weight charts. Also my body fat % went down from 25% to 20% so I had lost mostly fat. Since then, I have maintained my weight doing two moderate fasts of 1,200 calories each week.<br /><br />In the end, how do I evaluate this book? First of all, this diet works! It is easy to stick to long term for all-or-nothing types like me. Instead of reducing calories a little every day, I greatly reduce calories for two days a week, and eat normally on the others. And I love this diet's flexibility - no more going to parties and having to decline food.<br /><br />As for the cons, similar information and other 5:2 recipes are available online so one does not necessarily have to buy this book. Still The Fast Diet is recommended for those who lack the time to find the information online. Also, one must also avoid the trap of overeating on non-fasting days. While I did have days of indulgence, most of my normal eating days were just that - normal. Please do not take this diet as a license to overeat unhealthily every non-fasting day.<br /><br />Also, Dr. Mosley's 5:2 has not been the subject of as much research as has been done for Alternate daily fasting, where one fasts every other day. Most research on fasting's benefits was done on mice, not humans. Still, we are rapidly learning more about fasting and several studies have already come out since Mosley's Horizon Documentary, making the information in this book already slightly outdated, (Google Dr. Krista Varady for more details).<br /><br />In the end, please get your doctor's approval if you decide to try the The Fast Diet. I wish you the best of luck and hope your experience will be as fruitful as mine.<br /><br />Update (June 17, 2013): One of the mass media criticisms of the Fast Diet is that long-term weight maintenance would be difficult through fasting. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I am at my desired weight and find maintaining my weight so easy!  It has now been 10 months since starting this eating plan and I have lost another 10 lbs since I wrote this review (for a total weight loss of around 45 lbs).  Occasional fasts have become part of my lifestyle and it is so easy to do one or two fast days a week. And yes, I am still eating the forbidden foods, so I am amazed at how easy it is to maintain this weight!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My husband and I are enjoying this show very much.  It is full of drama, suspense, history and it is not full of foul language, nudity, and unnecessary violence.  It is just a very well done show.  It is well worth being a part of Masterpiece theater.

B00181JGI2|4.0|It's a slow paced movie and was obviously written in the stoner age but if you listen closely you will find a plot does exist and lessons are there to be learned.  Meanwhile, I can see why it has a cultish following!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I got Seasons when it was the free app of the day and have enjoyed it. Then I bought Green Forest and enjoy it too. I was shocked to find only 5 pictures on Black and White cities and put it in the cloud. When a reviewer said that Ocean Live has 25 pictures, I bought it and love it. I have two Kindle Fires, and these puzzles work well on both. I have not found this app to function nearly as well. Too bad, because there are lots of pictures, both free and paid.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I rated this book five stars because it has everything I look for in a book. There is lots of action and intrigue. I could not put it down. I am enjoying the  series immensely but it only scratches the details provided in the book. This is a great read!
B00169N0BK|5.0|I have been printing Giclee prints for the last ten years for artists.  Although I own an Epson 9890, I don't generally use the Epson papers and canvas.  Although many suppliers of artists materials provide profiles for their product, I've found that they don't give me near perfect color because of differences in ink ( I use MIS inks), canvas and papers.  The Colormunki has saved me thousands of dollars in profiling my materials, as well as speeding up my production.  Calibrate your monitor first (like Spider Pro) with the Colormunki, and then do each of your canvas's and papers.  You simply cannot match the accuracy of this instrument by changing the color and contrast characteristics in your printer software.<br /><br />Don't worry about the price.  You will easily save that much in the first few months of using Colormunki.  An added advantage is that you can install the software on other computers (like a client's), and profile their monitors.  I have numerous customers who pay me monthly to maintain their monitors, a three minute operation.
B000002GK1|5.0|I have a Prime Membership but still tend to try to get $25 or more for each purchase. Why I don't know I guess I am just stupid that way. Anyway I was looking for an item for around $5 and found this CD when I was looking at my Wishlist that had the new Soundgarden album on it. I liked the first two songs a lot so I thought I would give the album a try and I was not disappointed. Only odd thing was the old AAD recording lacks the vibrancy of more modern CD recordings.
B003N0XDT4|4.0|This is my first DAC/headphone amp. I generally really love it. With an ATH-M50 they sound a bit better but with AKG Q701, they sound significantly better. If you buy a Q701, the motherboard audio is not enough. You would have to turn the volume way up and even then it sounds really bad. While this E7 doesn't seem enough for the Q701, it is more than adequate to make it sound good. Maybe not to a seasoned audiophile, but to a hobbyist like myself, they still sound great. Someday I'll buy and E9 or E17. The thing should last multiple days unless you're using it nonstop. It works really well with Windows 7 but Windows 8 is bit different. On Windows 7 I was still able to use the system volume adjustment fine, but on Windows 8 only the volume controls on the device itself would work. This is real annoying if you like to have different programs at different volumes rather than just one across the board adjustment. So now I don't use it that much with my desktop but on my laptop and mp3 player, it's a great thing to have especially with headphones that my mp3 player can't push enough.

B0083GQ2A0|4.0|This tale of an airplane crash that was carrying individuals who felt as though their lives didn't matter was extremely well done through Liam Neeson telling his story from notes he had made.  The separation of each life undergoes a joining that is able to overcome the cold, frustration and hopelessness as they face the wolves.  It is amazing and extremely sad because as the story moves along, it is not the typical way you expect each scene to end.

If you would like to search for games or use your keyboard, please disconnect your Free and proceed.\\"<br /><br />The device is small.  A bit smaller than my iPhone, so it would fit right into a pocket.  That's the upside, the downside is that I would think this would primarily be a \\"guy\\" thing, and I think it might be a big small for most man hands.<br /><br />If gaming with Bluetooth is important to you, it may be worth the effort it takes to get it all working.  It's just not that important to me.

B008ADSDHQ|1.0|I am afraid this book is definititely not for me. It is far too long and too long winded. I think the author lost sight of the plot as he seemed to go off on different tangents quite, to my mind, unnecessarily. It is extremely rare for me not to finish a book especially one I had purchased for myself and I honestly tried very hard with this one but just after halfway through I had to give it up. I had struggled long enough!!!!

I hated reaching the end as much as I hate swallowing the last piece of the most delicious dessert that I won't ever get a chance to eat again.<br /><br />Why didn't I ever know how fabulous Jane Austens writing is? It should be required reading for everyone or at least every female who can read. So glad this only the first of the J.A. library. I can't think of how it will feel to come to the end of the last of this collection.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a well written story.  The fact that I saw the movie first took away some of the suspense because the movie plot pretty closely followed the book.  What came out in the book much better than in the movie was the conflict Katniss had about who to believe and who was trying to manipulate her for their own gain.  The message about standing up for what is right and daring to challenge the status quo was a good one.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series
B00000I07P|5.0|Ranks only behind \\"New Jersey,\\" this album broke BJ and made them the biggest rock band in the world.  It has their signature anthem \\"Livin on a Prayer\\" their first #1 in \\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\" and probably the song/video that truly made them huge in \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" since it was played on MTV every other minute...and really cemented BJ in the public consciousness.  Outside of the 3 huge hits, the best track on the album is \\"Never Say Goodbye.\\"  The only track I don't really care for is \\"Social Disease\\" and \\"Raise Your Hands\\" is ok, nothing great, but a concert crowd pleaser back in the day I'm sure.
B000XRG9IW|4.0|For whatever reason, this album kept cropping up in my Amazon recommendations, but, knowing what is best for me I didn't act upon it. Because I'm a full on METAL HEAD with a PROG PREDILICTION and I couldn't see how this would fit in with that. I mean, do you ever see anybody with \\"Black Mountain\\" embroidered on the back of their cut-off denim?<br />Then, one Friday night after partaking of some falling down water it managed to inveigle its way into my basket. Then it arrived, and blow me, if it's not a full on darn good album?<br />How would I describe it? Well maybe Jefferson Airplane meets Black Sabbath, maybe. Whatever it ROCKS with a full on 70s sensibility and it's stuffed full of MELLOTRON. Nice.<br /><br />Stand out track is the 17 minutes of Bright Lights which starts out in an Indie kind of way but ends up a full-on Hawkwind style wig out with (early) Floydian bits stuck in for good measure.<br /><br />The Troll says BUY WITH CONFIDENCE!!!!!!
B00000I07R|5.0|BJ has a trio of albums I'd give 5 stars to...New Jersey, Slippery, and Keep the Faith...in that order.  The only song I don't really like on this album is \\"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\\" (which unfortunately seems to be a concert staple for them).  The last couple of tracks on the album are ok, but kind of filler.  But everything else is great.  The title track, In These Arms, If I Was Your Mother, Bed of Roses...all are great songs.  The two hidden gems on this album though are Dry County and I Want You...two of my favs on the album.  \\"Dry County\\" is probably the most \\"epic\\" Bon Jovi song in their catalog...and yes, there's a video for it.  Youtube it.  Overall, this album has a great vibe...very uplifting and positive...but BJ would do a 180 turn a few years later with their next album, These Days.
B000001ESN|4.0|So, Rush release (studio) number 7. Can they keep things up?<br />Well, yes and no.<br />Yes, things are still at a high level.<br />No, because well, Hemispheres was better and you can't top (almost) perfection.<br /><br />It does kick off rather well with the old one-two of The Spirit of Radio and Freewill. I remember hearing these as pre-release versions at Stafford Bingley Hall and being seriously impressed by them. Heck, they were ingrained in the old Musical Memory banks after one listen - not anything you could say about the Rush of the last 25 years!<br />TSoR of course is Rush's biggest hit, still getting plays on old Radio 2 now - but only because it's long enough for Ken Bruce to change his incontinence pads.<br />Jacob's Ladder next, now this gets quite a bit of flack from some quartersm but I like it. Rush rung (groan - ed) every last bit of widescreen epic soundscapes with this. Not too shabby.<br />Entre Nous is more of a middling track, nothing special, like Different Strings, in one ear and out the other. I suppose that that makes Natural Science sound all the better, perhaps there was method to their madness.<br /><br />So, do you buy? Mais Oui!
B000001FKY|5.0|Hysteria and Appetite for Destruction are the two greatest albums of the 1980s.  From start to finish, with the possible exception of Run Riot, this album is loaded with killer tracks.  The big, bombastic sound of the 80s...driving riffs and harmonies...it doesn't get any better than this.  Plus, it's my all-time favorite album cover to boot.
B00004IC9G|5.0|Do you like Baby Oil?<br />Do you like Furry nappies?<br />Do you lack a sense of Humor?<br />Do you like Battles?<br />Do you like Hymns?<br />Are you from Portugal?<br />Do you like Dark Avengers?<br /><br />Picking your favourite MANOWAR album is a lot harder than picking your nose.<br />Today however it's Sign of the Hammer. Why? Because I've just listened to it!<br />Opening Track \\"Death Tone\\" sets the (death) tone for the rest of the album, a true METAL MANIFESTO.<br />\\"Shell Shock\\" is a savage indictment of the way 'nam Vets were treated. Yes, Manowar a band with brains.<br />In fact every track on the album is a KOLOSSAL KORNUKOPIA of all things METAL.<br /><br />So, if you like METAL - BUY IT!!!!<br /><br />If you don't like METAL - BUY IT, you soon will!!!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great drama.  It caught me on the first show and kept me captivated until the last show of the second season.  I am looking forward to the third season and finding out what happens to Matthew and Mary,
B000005RSW|5.0|Do you like Baby Oil?<br />Do you like Furry nappies?<br />Do you lack a sense of Humour?<br />Do you like Signs?<br />Do you like Hammers?<br />Are you from Portugal?<br />Can you count to Ten?<br /><br />Picking your favourite MANOWAR album is a lot harder than picking your nose.<br />Today however it's Sign of the Hammer. Why? Because I've just listened to it!<br />Opening Track \\"All Men Play on Ten\\" spells out in no uncertain terms how one must stay true to one's self and to the power of METAL! It forms part of my METAL MANIFESTO!<br />Other highlights are Thor (the Powerhead), the Title track and last track \\"Guyana\\" which is a slow burning monolithic MONSTER of a song all about the cult suicide by the members of Jim Jones' People's Church. So stick that in your pipe all those of you who think Manowar are just mindless Misogynists.<br /><br />So, if you like METAL - BUY IT!!!!<br /><br />If you don't like METAL - BUY IT, you soon will!!!!!!
0385342063|5.0|It has her usual &#34;tongue in cheek &#34;  humor I've come to expect that of her books. Hope that she continues the &#34;shopaholic &#34; series
B000001ESP|3.0|3.5 stars really.<br /><br />So, Rush release number eight. Where does it rank?<br /><br />Well, Moving Pictures was the first Rush release I was disappointed by. The over the Top METAL explorations were gone, never to return. In their place more concise songs. Cynical songs designed for US success, it worked, but just goes to show how often a group's best seller isn't their best album.<br /><br />Side 1 gives us a consistent run of four songs. Starting off with Tom Sawyer surely the most overplayed song in Rush's live set. I'd happily live without it, but it helps drag in the \\"casual\\" fans on their US Tours doesn't it Ray Danniel$?<br />Limelight next the song that makes me exclaim \\"I can't believe a drummer has an IQ of more than 10\\" as Mr Pert informs us that he would like all the perks of success but none of the downsides. Poor Lamb.<br />Red Barchetta is probably the pick of side 1's vocal songs. Nice and Jaunty.<br /><br />So, it's side 2 now. Ah, what a let down. Kicking off with The Camera Eye an attempt to recreate the success of same song played twice over Xanadu. Sorry guys it doesn't work.<br />Nor does Witch Hunt. A bit of a plodder, any self respecting Witch would easily outrun them even with a Trabant broomstick.<br />Finally Vital Signs flatlines along. Trying to marry Poplitefilth Police Reggae with New Wave mores and well, it doesn't work.<br /><br />So, do you buy? Yes, but it's not as good as many sheep would tell ewe.
B005LAIISA|4.0|Good movie. Very funny. My favorite character is the lion, Bill Stiller. it's a must watch movie. I recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved every minute of it!! When can you give more?? I'm not a book reader but isn't something that can be put down!!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Skyfall is an action film from start to finish. Daniel Craig is back as 007 in one of the best Bond films ever. This movie is a real treat for Bond fans. I highly recommend it.
B0090SI460|5.0|This is one funny movie!  Great collection to add to our 3d movies.  We're awaiting the College Monster version to come out.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Interesting but not what I thought it would be. I love all of his stories. I liked knowing about his wife and his life.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|The whole movie is black & white but its a really cute movie.  Great collection for people who like 3d movies
B0070YDOT8|1.0|I don't know...I haven't been able to play it yet!  I can't seem to download any of the games. Please give me some help.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|This is our favoritist 3D movie that we own.  It is a fantastic movie right from the beginning to the end.  The 3d graphics in this  movie, along with the story line is spectacular!!  It's one movie we can watch over and over and over.....................
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Great entertainment!  Fun and easy to watch. Mindless entertainment for when you just want to watch something.  Good for a short plane flight.
B0097PW7H8|1.0|I hate it. I only got it for the amount of good reviews. It just made my battery life decrease more. Worst one. not for the kindle :/
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  The acting is superb and the history lesson, as close as it may be to reality, was enjoyable.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I wanted this so i didn`t have to use the key board<br /><br />I couldn`t get the microphone to work so i don`t use it
0345536886|5.0|It was fun reading this book. Funny and full of human drama. The lawyer stories are nicely told and I also gained some insight into dealing with people and be upfront and be a straight shooter.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting, on the ride and on the go it keeps my time entertained, I would reccomend this game to anyone bc its just that fun :)
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|My son asked for it. I assume it is great.I cannot tell you anything else about the product. Your requirements for teh review of the products  are rediculous.
0812973992|3.0|It is beautifully structured and written but oh, so depressing. All of the characters are leading a life that is surely precariously balanced on a high wire of their own making.<br /><br />But ... The author challenged himself with a literary walk on the high wire, and in my view did not make it to the other side. The story is not told in a linear fashion. The time frame jumps forward and backward as often as the point-of-view character changes. As other GR readers have said, it is more a series of somewhat linked short stories than it is a novel.<br /><br />Almost every new scene was confusing and, to me, irritating. Who is this unnamed person? Where does he/she fit? Is this event happening before or after the last time we met this character? Even if this confusion was resolved within a page or two, it nevertheless unbalanced the flow of my reading. By the time that flow was reestablished, the scene was over and another scene created a new disruption.<br /><br />The lack of a single protagonist to carry the emotion of the story made the unsettling disruptions worse. Every time I began to feel something, the story line and character which had evoked those feelings disappeared and the emotion dissipated. I could never really settle in to enjoy the story. Was this the author's intent?<br /><br />A clue to this intent is found in the interview with the author at the end of the book. \\"Did you envision the whole plot of this book in advance?\\" he is asked. McCann answers, \\"I just got happily lost over and over again! It's a fairly intricate maze, but I never mapped it out, it just kept unfolding for me. There were times I didn't feel like I was writing it at all. I was being blown around by twelve different voices.\\"<br /><br />The result of this haphazard approach was unsatisfying for me. Some confusion is fine, but I don't like a book totally structured that way. Had the high wire guy prepared in that manner, he would never have gotten to the top of the towers, and wouldsurely have fallen off if he had.<br /><br />My conclusion: many pieces of \\"Let The Great World Spin\\" were well researched and beautifully told, but for me the whole was less than its parts. It's hard to decide when there are such disparate elements, but I end up with 3*.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is sooooooooooooooooooo cool! The update is so cool as well!<br />The egg collecting idea to get 100 eggs I did do because I got a chick surfboard<br />The game I love it is good to get keys to!
0307720950|5.0|Anderson's experience as a businessman and technology editor for Wired provides a valuable insight on the world I first came to know in earier works based on the Bits and Atoms initiative at MIT.  As a student of automation since the early 6ut0s I came away encouraged but clear-eyed about the future that is not like the Singularity but more human and humane.  It is going to be a bumpy ride but I am encouraged.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Because the Weather Channel (weather.com) exhibits strange behaviors in the Kindle browser, I needed a decent<br />app to keep an eye on the weather.  With Spring approaching, I wanted the ability to monitor for alerts, watches, and<br />warnings, and the AccuWeather app delivers the information I need.<br /><br />The price is right, too!<br /><br />-Steve in Dubuque, Iowa
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|This is the kind of book that I usually stay well away of. Especially when the setup is multi character perspective that jumps in time.<br />Unfortunately Jeffrey Archer is able to write about this subject in a way that is truly captivating. For my own protection I will not buy the sequal until I have time for a nonstop reading spree, such as a vacation.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Love the game. Hate that it keeps asking me to rate it. It's simple yet elegant. It has some Nice music too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was hooked from the start, again I couldn't put it down and had to read what was going to happen next.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The strength of the is book lies in the part of the narrative that is done from the abusive husband's perspective. It's a dark departure for Sparks which pays off.
B003XG831Q|5.0|Here you have a special Nordstrom's two-for-one issue of the first \\"Bossa Nova\\" record in the USA, Jazz Samba -- paired with the immortal Getz/Gilberto recording.<br /><br />JAZZ SAMBA.  Recorded in two days in a Washington, D.C.church by Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz.  They had created the first wonderful HIT, \\"Desafinado\\", from the recording.  Since these two were more or less \\"winging it\\" there is a wonderful spontaneous feel to their music.  Came out in 1960 and caught the \\"gringos\\" with their pants down (if you pardon the expression.)  \\"Desafindo\\" was a major HIT and stayed at the top of the charts for, I don't know, something like 24 weeks.  (At this point in time, no one, more or less had heard of Joao Gilberto, the father of Bossa Nova.)  Actually, Charlie Byrd and his boys were on a \\"good will\\" trip to Brazil and Charlie heard, liked and bought several Joao Gilberto LP's.  (Remember them?)  Then he played them for Getz and Verve producer Grantz.  And JAZZ SAMBA was born.  (What else could they call it?)<br /><br />GETZ/GILBERTO.  Recorded in the fall of 1963 but not released until Summer 1964 (when they hoped the Bossa Nova \\"FAD\\" had ended and their might be room for the REAL THING.)  Remember the \\"Girl from Ipanema\\" (or \\"gal\\" as Astrud Gilberto sings.)  The entire recording with Joao, his then wife, Astrud, Getz, Antonio Carlos Jobim (the composer of many of the songs) and an imported brazilian drummer, Milton Banana -- (real name) who was brought up to the USA to add authenticity.  Which he certainly did!  This is a world class album that will still be bought and listened to ONE HUNDRED YEARS FROM TODAY!  And I am not kidding!  If you have not heard it (is there anyone who has not?)-- buy it!  Listen to Joao, Astrud, Stan, \\"Tom\\", and Milton and a bassist (whom I forget.)  Then you will have experienced Heaven on earth.  (Personal note:  unfortunately Stan Getz, and Antonio (\\"Tom\\") Carlos Jobim have both died.<br /><br />And just think, when everyone professionally associated with this Getz/Gilberto wonder is no longer here -- WE CAN STILL LISTEN TO THEM CREATING SOME MOST EXQUISITE MUSIC!  And they will all be ALIVE AGAIN!
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|Fun enough game, nothing special, nothing extraordinary, just a good, solid game.<br /><br />Buy it if you enjoy air hockey games, it doesn't disappoint.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|My original set had a disc go bad, so this was a replacement. Until Matt Smith took over, Eccleston was my favorite new Doctor, and now i'm in a toss-up between. I just wish he had done more than one season. This is the beginning of the new series and a must if you're going to start as a new fan. I just wish they would put these out on Blu-Ray.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my adult son.  We had seen the movie on television and he loved it.  Now he can watch it whenever he wishes.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|These movies/specials were not seen in the US and all star Tennent. (My least favorite Doctor of the new series, but that's like saying my least favorite chocolate in the box. ;p). Fills in a lot of questions about things the series referenced. Four new Doctor stories! One is a 2-part for 5 discs). What more do you need to know, if you are a fan, get it.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I'll start with this, I love this game. it's awesome. neat concept and fun graphics and best of all you can get in game dollars without having to spend real money. but it often lags something awful. moving around the map or using the market takes forever. many times it won't recognize that I've tapped anything at all. it makes the code red game impossible. I end up frantically tapping with no effect at all. it drives me nuts. its really frustrating because its such a great game otherwise
B001EN71CW|5.0|All the same features as the old set in a single width box! If you are not familiar with the series, I believe it is one of the best Sci-Fi TV series ever made. Character driven in an interesting &#34;'verse&#34; where high tech, modern and old-West meat and mix with some Chinese influence. May sound strange, but they made it work beautifully. Spaceships don't battle here, but gunfights happen and there's even a classic &#34;train job&#34;. Does have a slightly darker side that lends realism to the often light-hearted dialog. It's worth seeing if you haven't (or even if you have).
B000W91RUG|5.0|Love love love this show! I got this as a Christmas gift and was surprised to find them so cheap online.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A clever, upbeat story.  Had it not been for Forest Gump stealing the show with its insertion of the title character into historical incidents, another star would have been merited.  Still, the author made a most enjoyable read out of a totally improbable fable.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Bought this for my husband for his birthday. He loved it. The first season was much better. But this one was still good.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great entertainment, excellent script writers, superb acting, highly recommended for the entire family, and many wonderful life-enriching and edifying scenes.
B00BECZPI0|5.0|Love love love love love this show!!! I was pretty upset when I messed The show Sunday night. Then a friend of mine told me about the optional to buy The show online with amazon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would get this app minecraft is awsome just awesome i love it if it's 10dollars I would still get this app
B00009R86L|5.0|i love the domke bags, this pad makes it easy to hall my gear around town.gos on my f2, and fx3 but doss not fit the f6 bag and strap!
030758836X|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. I can't put it down! Really well written and so intriguing. I love it.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I had never seen this movie before. It completely lived up to my expectations with the story line, songs, cast and I was completely amazed by the costuming. Great movie.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Good movie regardless which of the plots or subplots you happen to be interested in. Duo of Amy Adams and Clint Eastwood is surprising
B003ASLJKO|2.0|\\"City Heat\\" was released a week before \\"[[ASIN:B00005IA7Y The Cotton Club]]\\" in December, 1984. It's basically a farce version of that film, set in Kansas City. You would think that with Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood this would be a solid gangster comedy, if not great, but you'd be wrong.<br /><br />The opening scene where Reynolds gets in a brawl in a diner while Eastwood coolly sits nearby keys off that \\"City Heat\\" is not meant to be taken seriously; in fact, it's downright goofy. It's not a good start and the film never recovers.<br /><br />The movie's only 93 minutes long, but it seems a lot longer. Something about it doesn't click. The characters are cartoons so it's next to impossible to care about them. The problem isn't Reynolds or Eastwood, as they have their usual charisma. The problem is the farcical nature of the material and the convoluted plot.<br /><br />Still, it's amusing at times so it's mildly worthwhile if you're a fan of the stars, just don't expect anything all that good.<br /><br />GRADE: D+ or C-
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I was not sure what to expect when I picked this book up. Steven Chbosky's Charlie is a 15 year old writing a first-person narrative of his first year of high school.  Yeah, fine. maybe this will be the guy's version of Juno or some other contemporary humorous coming-of-age story. Oh my God. I got a bit more than I bargained for. Yes his exploits are joyful, painful-and revealing. His friendships with Sam and Patrick are wonderfully complex things. But there is a disturbing undercurrent, things the character says and writes which neither the character nor the reader fully appreciate until Charlie's descent into madness.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|great app works all the time when you need it it's always there for you!!! and I've never ever ever ever gotten a virus from this app, works well, works thoroughly every time you use it!! a must have in your apps!!! Thanks Adobe Reader!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Story and knowledge- a combination I love. Having never experienced anything like what Victoria went through in her life, I felt deep compassion and pain for those in circumstances without being able to experience love. The meaning of flowers was very interesting and brought me back to days when I had made selections so I could compare my choices against the reality I was facing or was planning to face.<br />Very well written
B00B04KVMC|5.0|I am a fan of basically whatever Dave Grohl does, so when I heard this was being made I preordered as soon as I could...everything! DVD, downloads, Roswell t shirt, everything. I was not disappointed in any of it. The doc was intriguing, the music great. Thank you Dave for doing this and I can't wait to see the next move!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|If you love Supernatural this is the season you want to have for your dvd library! Yellow Fever is the best episode on disc two.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|A little soapy but an interesting part of our history, my great grandfather came over as an indentured slave and became successful. To compare it with real slavery is a good lesson for all to read. Easy and enjoyable read. Good characters to keep the story going.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book drags on and on .  It tries to get suspenseful way to predictable. And the ending leaves you wondering why you bothered to read it.
B009POHHR6|5.0|An interesting perspective which doesn't paint the Soviets as monsters. They were a great people with ideals different from America's; they weren't evil. The ending was superb as it eloquently showed how we often create our own troubles when trying to \\"make a better world.\\"
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Follows the book very well( I've read the book 3 times). Very well shot movie. Makes you feel like you are right there next to the Dwarfs. Not a boring moment in it. Can't wait until the next one comes out.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig is my favorite bond. He oozes masculinity and confidence in the this role, with just a light hint that he has some actual human weakness. His cocky humor is soooo sexy. Spoiler Alert! Great introduction of two new actors to fill the traditional roles or M and Q. Looking forward to more from this group.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|This is a very intense, tear jerking film. It was very well done. I also wanted to go back and see it again, because the star is now in a television series that I like very much.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|Always a favorite.  Never can go wrong withg Little Shop of Horrors!  &#34;Feed Me Seymour!!! FEED ME!! Never a waste of time.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love this story. I have the older movies and enjoy them. But this is so touching and wonderful music too
1845767055|5.0|Paul Bonner is a True master of fantasy creatures, fills the characters with spirit and individuality. (and here ARE FOUR MORE WORDS, to creat a valid review)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I probably put down 4 out 5 books before I finish. If I'm not totally engaged and can't wait to pick it up again, why bother? Gone Girl is very well written and very engaging. I LOVE this book, and look forward to reading my next Gillian Flynn novel.
B00A2IUDO8|3.0|If you're a fan of Family Guy and other Seth MacFarlane productions then you will definitely enjoy watching this movie. However, you won't get anything memorable like the Hangover 1 or even scratch the surface of some of the best Family Guy episodes.  Check this movie out for a rent if you want to have a funny night, but don't get too excited as it will leave you satisfied, but underwhelmed if you are expecting a cult hit.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I first found out about this game from one of my friends and thought it was stupid because it was so similar to temple run, and now that I have it on my kindle & I pod it's great I can't put it down, I'd stay up all night playing it's exhausting honestly but so addicting. The quality is great, sound and everything. Enjoy!
B006UUK612|4.0|We have watched this movie several times...one night we decided to watch it agin.  Did not want to look through all our DVDs for it, so we rented it.  It is a very entertaining movie!!!
0316017930|4.0|Very interesting read! It shows you how to analyze people from a completely different point of view. This is a book that's needs to be reread a few times.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Very good product. My core's temperature drops 10 degree while idle. Highly recommend. And you should replace your compound every 3-6 months
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Another lovely & wonderful CD from one of the world's greatest singers. This blind man sees more with his heart than sighted people will ever know!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app, it does what it is supposed to do. gives detailed,  accutate info about battery life and how long certain activities can be done before it needs to be charged again.
B0076D21O2|3.0|My husband wanted me to watch this movie. He saw it before and thought it is a good movie. I did not like that it was not available for renting, so we ended up purchasing it for $9.99. The movie was okay, definitely not something I would watch again. It gives you some details about the historical period Shakespeare lived in and it is based on the hypothesis that Shakespeare's works are not actually his.
B0020M99LC|3.0|I wanted more suspense and mystery. An element of surprise would have felt good too. I was also looking for more super gadgets. I feel like the James Bond franchise is moving to a different image of James Bond, something  far less swave, and sophisticated and instead, a more rugged look and type as opposed to an extreemely actractive man. I feel like this is displayed in the choice of actors and the writing in this film. I prefer the more sophisticed swave James Bond that has lost of super gadgets. Oh, and he can be rather rugged and muscle bound and abs are welcome too.  A reasonably good job of acting
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Nice story with lot of Hollywood suspense. I was not as impressed with it as I was with other Oscar movies.  I would not watch it again.
B007SGM084|5.0|If you only read Fifty Shades of Grey, you may think I am a sex addict.  Because of my background, I had to find out what was Christian's problem.  He obviously had some deep seeded trauma.  So I read the other two books in trilogy and everything came together and I was able to understand Christian and was happy for him.  DON;T just read the first book.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Initially I thought this would be a good SF movie, which I love. However, the plot was silly. The special effects were okay. This is not a movie I would watch again or recommend.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|or be prepared to lose your head!! There is absolutely nothing like THE GAME OF THRONES on TV or in the theaters. Here is one amazing show that will immediately grab the attention of most people. Wicked teenage King Joffrey shows no mercy to friends and enemies alike and there is danger in the kingdom as several pretenders have a more legitimate claim to the thrown than Joffrey.<br /><br />Joffrey is the son of the deceased king of Baratheon clan but he is 100% Lannister though his mother and his biological father. Yes, we learn in Season One that the good Queen's children have all been fathered by her brother. We've learned soon enough that GAME OF THRONES is also a game of sexual misconduct - as if the political intrigue is not fascinating enough.<br /><br />Season 2 does not disappoint anyone who was hooked on Season One. The drama and suspense continues. GAME OF THRONES is not hesitant to shock or surprise us. We lost a lead character in Season One so expect more in Season 2. No one is safe and no one will find mercy. This is a time of fear and violence in Westeros. No one is safe and no one can be trusted. It is a chore trying to keep all the characters in mind and to remember who they are in the scheme of life..who is related to whom and who betrayed a trusted friend..no to mention who is having an affair with a secret lover.<br /><br />Peter Dinklage is a stand-out in Season Two. Tyrion Lannster, \\"The half-man,\\" as he often refers to himself, finds love and courage in Season 2. Tyrion is a dwarf who is barely tolerated by his Lannister father and siblings, yet he, alone, has a semblance of decency and humanity in his heart. The self-proclaimed coward finds the courage to fight for the Lannister Dynasty despite the evil and treachery of his nephew King Joffrey and his sister the Queen. Tyrion is redeemened in an absolutely amazing sea battle that is a keystone of Season Two. Tyrion's brilliance helps save the kingdom but praise will not come his way.<br /><br/>GAME OF THRONES is amazing on so many levels. The diverse and beautiful scenery and real. The snowy wastelands scenes were filmed in Iceland and were not computer generated. The amazing crew is beyond brilliant and stunning. Again, the hard part of GAMES OF THRONES is keeping track of everyone. The blu-ray does have a drop down menu to give you information on the characters throughout the episodes. I found it confusing and distracting and hard to read from a distance. I felt the blu-ray had some flaws in its menu and presentation but GAME OF THRONES is brilliant and I am waiting for Season 3.
0375507256|5.0|I first picked up Cloud because I had heard the Matrix creators had bought the rights, but didn't start reading until the movie was near completion. The book is well thought out and dovetails from story to story abruptly at first, but with reason. I enjoyed the characters and their journeys - like other good novels - it'll be a slow start, but once you get in, you'll fly through the rest. Highly recommended!

006224454X|1.0|The old time publishing industry is drawing at straws these days isn't it, at least compared to the Independent Publishers, right? It's got to be in some seriously crummy shape when they have reviews touting how thrilling a book is that's flat out boring, repetitive, and a waste of time to read. Before I Go to Sleep, is promoted as a thriller, sure, real thrilling. Not only is that false and misleading, it's pathetic. That it's well written is a stretch. Thriller? Yeah, right. Even the font was anemic.<br /><br />The amnesia trope, already long in the tooth, is used once more, only here's a gal who goes to sleep, wakes up with no memory of previous days. Here she is every day believing she's still a 20 something gal in a 40 something body with a personal history she's gotta figure out. Sounds like it could be interesting, right? Wrong.<br /><br />We have to figure out what her backstory is. Okay, maybe there's some real excitement, right? Hell no. At least in the feature Fifty First Dates, Adam Sandler's tale is amusing. This book is not. But it's touted as a thriller, fair enough. All these glowing reviews by folks of fabulous credentials. How could they all be this far off? This was about as thrilling as watching paint dry. This book fails horribly as a thriller. Badly as a novel, and was a waste of my time. It's structure is a fugue where a boorish gal awakes daily with no recollection of her life I thought that there had to have some pizazz, some fantastic tale, right? Hell no.<br /><br />The Bourne series were thrillers. This was mediocre formula writing, hyped, and marketed to imbeciles who buy by word of mouth.<br /><br />What were they thinking--the acquisitions editors, agents, and reviewers--when they signed off on this project?<br /><br />How could anyone trust a review from these jokers again?<br /><br />No question that this book was heavy on the guerrilla marketing, and  Watson, not a bad writer, needed a little push to sell some books.<br /><br />Thepremise could have been interesting, and in the hands of a more imaginative author, could have been a slick, compelling read. Here we go--a wife who can't find the previous day's memories keeps a notebook she hides it from her husband. Maybe there's something thrilling, but on and on with the same repetitive schtick each day Christine's narrative arc is to find out who she is, what happened to her life becomes, as I've repeated three times just that--repetitive.<br /><br />Trust me, there is no grand revelation. It's solid BMC. B for banal, a couple M's for mundane, and monotonous, and a big C for crummy. You stop caring about the lead within a few chapters when the 40ish body--she's still tinkering with the lost memory, missing youth gambit, yet torches up a smoke, hides her diary, and takes the reader on her journey to find out what she missed. Not much.<br /><br />This is a book for suckers who buy into the hype of the \\"book experts\\" and reviews. Save your money, buy a real thriller that takes an amnesiac plot tool and leverages it into a an epic series--Was this book a Bourne again read?  Hell no.<br /><br />I will never trust a review by these folks--the book reviewers again. I have to reckon the people getting paid to keep the brick and mortar houses open have to do something to justify their salaries. Maybe some of these so-called wonder tales should list the folks who green light projects like this so we know what were getting, and by whom.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. Never had any issues with it and enjoy playing it.not sure what e else to say
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The dialogue at the beginning made me and my family almost fall asleep.  I think the beginning was far too long, but after all that talking the action started.  The rock monsters were awesome, but I could not persuade me kids to be excited after the exhausting start.  We also did not like the ending.  I thought the days of drawing customers in by leaving the ending of movies was leading.  I really do not want to be pushed into seeing the next movie, but push they did.<br />I gave the movie three stars and now that I am writing about it I am thinking 2 1/2 might be  better.

0060763280|1.0|The whole book is based on Mantras with little tangible content. The entire book could be condensed to one page. If you're into the Tony Robbins Motivational style content this book may be for you. Eker seams to follow that type of format. I am not a fan of cherry picking examples where some techniques have worked for some people. Eker uses this to pad out his book and to stimulate motivation in his reader however this is not scientific approach and provide little value one week after this book is back on the bookshelf.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is simply great! I know there isn't flint and steel yet but that is ok! I think Minecraft fans will love this app. There some items you can't get in this version but I think they will fix that. Overall, it's fantastic
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I usually read historical romance with handsome heroes and beautiful heroines That is definitely  not what this book has to offer. What you get is characters that you can identify with passages that make you laugh and cry and when you're done with the book you feel like you've read a very very very good book Through most of the book you can't help but appreciate all the love you have in your life.

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it reminded me of her book 19 minutes...it was really long and boring at some parts though...but it made me almost cry...I would have given it 5 stars but it's not perfect...the whole suicide theme. I understand what is like. Jodi writes a story and it pulls at your heart, you sympathize with the characters..as a victim, parent, sibling etc.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was the best game that I have ever played.I think that everyone should play this game called Subway Surfers.Mighty good game.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Although i have yet to complete it, i am very impressed by both the and the graphics and the gameplay. You can even throw yourself onto land and some boats. And you can get some incredible air.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Those of you looking at these reviews to determine whether the book could possibly as beautiful and as breath taking as the film--let me assure you, it is! It's full of wonderful anecdotes that wrap the story in a perfect package. It's descriptive and graphic, the author holds nothing back in telling this story. Reading this was a glorious experience, and I consider it a classic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best game I really recommend its a good game it is  cool i  love this app
B0041JLUIM|5.0|This is a Great movie I loved it can't wait for the second one to hit the theaters soon !!!! I'm there..lol
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Very easy, calm game and I like the fact that you don't have to touch a lot of buttons to play
030758836X|2.0|I wanted to really like this book after hearing rave reviews from some family members/friends, but the writing style, perspectives and authenticity of the characters all were uneven.  The voice of the husband Nick was not credible and felt like a woman author trying to write from a man's perspective.  After few chapters, the dialogue was getting more and more annoying and \\"forced\\" and I started feeling like I was reading a mini-novelette from \\"Ladies Home Journal\\" that one finds in a dentist's office.  I am sooo glad I didn't buy this, rather, borrowed it from the local library.  I skipped through it until the final 25% (which got slightly better), and guessed accurately that the FINAL answer to keeping the husband around was for the crazy wife to finally...... well you guess yourself.  NO SPOILERS!  YAWN.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|How bad is it when I would rather play this game on my 3-year old iPod Touch with its tiny 3.5&quot; screen than on my brand new Samsung Galaxy with a 5&quot; view?  I cannot believe the resolution in this its so bad as to be positively FUZZY.  This seems to be typical of Android apps that I've looked into or installed. Whereas Apple does indeed seem to have an app for almost anything you could think of, with the Android markets, it's hit or miss . . . and when you DO find what you want, be ready to compromise your standards.<br />When Plants vs. Zombies is done right, it's well worth the $5 I originally paid for it on my iPod. For THIS Android version? . . . UNINSTALLED.

1400069742|5.0|I loved Lynne Olson's Citizens of London.  Those Angry Days is just as good and in a few respects better, although it needs an editor's firm touch.<br /><br />Olson is very good at finding stories in history we only think we know, and then giving us a much fuller picture.  In this case, she's taken the period from 1939-1941 and tracked the tug of war between strong isolationists and eager interventionists.  Because she is fond of telling history through the lives of historical figures, she has picked Charles Lindbergh to represent the isolationists and FDR to represent the interventionists.  That's not a wholly accurate conceit as Lindbergh was somewhat late to the party of full blown isolationism, and FDR as she herself noted could go for maddeningly long periods of doing nothing, even when the public clamored for action.  However, they're two of the great figures in the start of the last century and so that's where she draws her dichotomy.<br /><br />Give her credit; this is a spellbinding story and the 460 pages just melted away for me.  Her prose style is easy to fall in with, and she has done her research well. It helps that there is a cast of characters who ware as unforgettable as they are improbable.  Amongst the isolationists there is Burton Wheeler, Gerald Nye, Robert Wood, Colonel McCormick, all fascinating fellows.  Amongst the interventions are Stimson, Ickes, Morgenthau, Hopkins, and the list goes on.  They're rich characters and Olson is a deft hand at sending just the right amount of time on each.<br /><br />And then of course, there is Anne Lindbergh.  Olson does a good job of portraying a deep and disturbed woman who married for idealism, had her first child kidnapped and murdered in 'The Crime of the Century', and went on to a fairly distinguished literary career.  She is the tragic figure of the closely surveyed players.  I wish there had even been a bit more about her in the book.<br /><br />There are several things most people don't know which come out in the book.  I had no idea how close the military here was to the Germans.  I had no idea that an Army general leaked a top secret war plan to the press and was never tried for it. I had no idea how amateurish the German spy network was in the US.<br /><br />I do have some problems with gaps in her knowledge.  Early in the book she claims that Britain dithered for 3 days after the invasion of Poland before declaring war.  That's not true as Richard Overy's small, but masterful 1939 proves. When discussing McCormick and pointing out how strong his distaste for England and the East Coast was, she expresses it by saying he had no interest in anything east of the Mississippi River.  Last time I looked, Chicago, his beloved city, was 150 miles east of that same river.  She repeats a couple of anecdotes as if they're new each time. And, although editorial oversight seems to be in rapid decline in American non-fiction, these slights don't kill a terrific story.<br /><br />If you've any interest in WWII, or 20th century American politics, I urge you to read this book as soon as you can.come out in the book.

B00271DNP4|3.0|I was very disappointed with this movie in comparison with the book.  They left out parts I believe were important to the plot, changed things and added things that did not happen in the book.  The book was amazing and I don't believe this move brought to light properly.
B005HSL626|5.0|Very addicting and love to challenge my boyfriend on this game! IT can be like the angry birds game that you just don't want to stop once you get to play it!
B007XUMHQK|3.0|Haven’t listened to this LP in a while.  It is actually better than what I remembered.  The only track I really remember ever liking was the last song – Edward (The Mad Shirt Grinder) because it is a piano/keyboard based instrumental.  Never was a big fan of the pre-Chet Powers (aka - Dino Valenti/Jesse Oris Farrow) QMS releases, but this one is probably the best of those early releases, because from a stylistic standpoint it covers a lot of ground (one might say it is all over the place, but a good thing in this case).  The vocals are pretty bad, not that Valenti was that great a vocalist, but he was an improvement over the others.  I guess the other thing I like about this release is that it does not contain all the extended, boring, droning, ‘Chuck Berry-ish’ guitar jam tunes.  I know a lot of people really liked those tunes (but not me), claiming QMS to be one of the great guitar jam bands at the time.  The last thing to note is the fact that although I believe all the marketing descriptions for these Culture Factory CD reissues describe them as “Deluxe” reissues, they are really not, based on current standards.  This is the second one I’ve purchased, and like the other “What About Me”, there is really nothing “Deluxe” about the reissues at all (at least not these two).  Yes, the audio has been re-mastered, but there is not a single bonus track and there is no booklet of any type (e.g., with historical info, etc), or any added liner notes at all.  So essentially all you get is a re-mastered CD packaged in a basic mini-LP sleeve (as you have with countless basic reissues of other older releases).  But on the good side, they appear to be selling at a reasonably low ‘basic CD’ price (at least for the two I’ve purchased anyway).  P.s. Whoever did the re-mastering must have fallen asleep at the end of track 3 because you can hear what sounds like some minor background noise as the track fades out.
B002VHI8J0|4.0|I marvel at the way Mitchell weaves six seemingly disjointed (both in time, place and topic) narratives into one interlinked story. It calls to my mind a patchwork made with fabric vastly differing in color and texture stitched together to form a unique and magnificent quit.<br />The only drawback in reading this book was that on one of the narratives, the spelling was so \\"morphed\\" to reflect the dialect of the protagonist that I could not comprehend some of it, especially as a non-native reader.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|This app works reasonably well. However, two key features are missing:<br />- Read-to-me (or text-to-speech). This feature only seems to come on their bulky devices where it is less useful. Android has a flexible TTS architecture which allows you to switch in high quality TTS engines, so they just need to piggy back on that.<br />- Sort library by most recently accessed is missing. It is a pain to have to search through your library to find books you're reading now on other devices.<br />I think they should charge a few bucks for these apps so that they will actually pay attention to them! Either that or license it out to someone who will focus on the customers.

B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|The movie was cute.  It was light and entertaining. I would not pay to see in the movies but fun to rent and watch.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I thought this was a very good movie and brought to life what we read in history books.  I recommend it to everyone.

B007UW9WOQ|5.0|To think this film is only about Sushi would be a gross misunderstanding.  This film is about man's search for perfection and the things that he has to do in life to strive for that.  What a beautiful film this is and a great pleasure to watch it.

B00AW57L96|5.0|I have loved Liane Moriarty's other books and I love her honest and perceptive looks behind the walls of Australian families.<br /><br />This book looks at 3 different families and how they are connected and how fragile our relationships are when communication is missing.<br /><br />Cecilia and John Paul are successful with 3 daughters and a seemingly perfect North Shore (Sydney) life but a letter written 15 years ago is about to unravel that perfection.<br /><br />Tess and Will live in Melbourne and have a son being bullied at school and run a successful business together with her cousin Felicity - but a shock announcement will leave her questioning everything and returning to Sydney to help her mother.<br /><br />Rachel is the mother of a young girl who was murdered in the 80's and she has never let it go - she works at the local catholic primary school and her world is about to be shattered by news that her son is taking her grandson to New York.<br /><br />How do the lives of these 3 people - worlds apart in nature and age unite to help each other. What are the shock waves that run through each family? How do families stay together and what binds them when times are tough? How do each of them deal with news that turns their worlds upside down and will they come through it?<br /><br />Amazing book - that I wanted to keep going and going and wanted to snuggle up with the characters every night to hear their stories continue.<br /><br />Liane is honest and thought provoking whilst still being humorous and light. A must read!!!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Well told story, but hard time following at times and keeping all the characters straight.  Even though you knew how it ends, last part dramatic.

B006ZZANFG|5.0|Loreena McKennitt can't make a bad CD.  Of course, I love her style of music.  Nights From the Alhambra was great.  There are hits from several of her albums I did not have, plus some other favorites of mine, plus new songs.  What's not to like?<br />I highly recommend it.

B000J233SK|5.0|I bought this for a relative - I've had it for several years.  When I bought it in Dallas, you couldn't go to a mall without hearing this song coming out of every store.  It was a smash hit.  It's a great CD.  I love Loreena McKennitt's style.  My favorite is folk music and bluegrass.  I love to hear the music of different nations and read the stories about how she went about writing them.  I hope she will continue this practice.
B003GK2216|4.0|Well crafted novel with interesting historical perspectives. The characters are compelling and you can't help falling in love with their individual and collective stories.

B005D0RDIE|4.0|Great concert for sure. Little disappointed in the sound - not up to what was captured in the R30 dvd's but then again it may be a case of too much concert hall sound in the mix.
B0041KVZ1S|5.0|Let it be is a great Beatles album even tho it was not a happy album for the Fab 4. the title track is awesome with other great songs on it. i think John said it was a bunch of recorded crap. just goes to show how great they were if you call that crap.

B0091THRCU|4.0|The case is real leather and well built. The iPhone 5 goes in easy enough but I have missed a few calls trying to get it back out again. I'm sure this will ease with use. The pull tab is elastic and lifts the phone out but with some effort. The credit card slot is nice to have but good luck getting your card back out again.<br />I'm happy I purchased this case, much better than spending $135.00 for the one Tiffany & Co. is rolling out. But for this user a rubberized plastic case is best for me. The iPhone 5 feels good in the hand but I'm afraid if I drop it the joy will be over! Plus it's just too darn hard to get the phone out of the Snugg sleeve in time to get that call, and in the sleeve you cannot see the screen so you cannot see if you've received a notification.

This book is packed with a lot of intense scenes and at some point i kept wondering why i was reading this nonsense... but as a 27 year old man, let me just tell you. I've gotten laid 15 times just because I brought this book up, played stupid, asked questions, and the next thing you know I got her tied up to my bed posts... yeah buddy. it's like instant sex after reading this book. all the women want a Mr. Grey... lmao. too easy.

B005NQ5LSC|3.0|Fans of Ip Man and Ip Man 2 are sure to find their way to this flick, which, if it had been made first would have gone down just fine as an average martial arts movie, but as it came in their shadow feels like a just passable direct-to-video sequel to a well-received blockbuster.<br /><br />I won't get into how much of the story must be pure fabrication for this \\"biographical\\" picture, but it serves well enough as a framework to insert action scenes. There is plenty of martial arts skill on display here too, so genre fans shouldn't be disappointed in that. However, a lot of it is simply sparring, or dealing with local bullies, and there's never really that adrenaline-pumping feeling that anything's really at stake for Ip Man.<br /><br />The story does try to insert the drama that will liven up the fight scenes, but it's all hammered into the final act without any build up or tension. However, if you do turn off your brain entirely, the action scenes are entertaining enough to keep Legend is Born from being an abomination, if not a memorable martial arts thrill ride.<br /><br />In the end, Legend is Born is entertaining enough for action fans. It has an interesting, if wildly fictional, story and is well-acted. It's a great movie for a lazy afternoon.
B004PR71JC|5.0|It's the famliy fav cd and even the movie we can't stop listen to it I even listen at work.
B000O1799U|4.0|I was only a toddler when the original hit Broadway, but have always been a fan of The Supremes,the girl group on whom this production is loosely based. Having grown up listening to the original voices (Jennifer Holliday, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Loretta Devine -- who makes a guest appearance in this 2006 movie), it was a leap for me to appreciate the update without bias. With each song, I wanted to experience the original, to see actresses who weren't self-aware in an industry that hadn't yet bought into its own hype. Still, the movie has its merits. The story leaves a lot out as concerns racism, industry, and artist struggle during the 1960s and 70s. We also missed out on character enrichment to, for example, explain why Effie needed so many people to love her. No need for psychoanalysis, but something to make her not look like a desperate, raging egomanic and set us up for the show's #1 song &#34;And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going.&#34; Visually, the film was fun! Eddie Murphy is fantastic with major kudos for Jennifer Hudson and Keith Robinson. We've seen better from Jamie Foxx, although it was different to see him in this villainous role. And then there's Beyonce. What can be said? She was simply Beyonce, gorgeous performer/entertainer/brand. I couldn't see any character development or acting skills, although she did deliver a great facial expression every once in a while.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|This is one CD I play all the time. There are no songs I just want to  skip. My first Black Keys CD, probably not my last.
B00B5JBZGS|4.0|I almost jumped the gun and wrote a review after only listening to this album twice. The review was going to be 3 stars, citing good production value but sounding a little bland compared to some of their earlier work. I decided to give this one a few more spins, and I'm glad I did, because it is a very good album.<br /><br />The first 8 tracks are great. They all sound like vintage KSE. The album's opener, \\"The Hell in Me\\" starts things off with intense heaviness. \\"Beyond the Flames\\" is my personal favorite on the album; it is fast, heavy and beautiful all at once. I found \\"Turning Point\\" and \\"You Don't Bleed for Me\\" to be others that had me hitting repeat on the Ipod.<br /><br />I found myself a little bored with \\"The Call\\", \\"No End In Sight\\", and \\"Always\\", although \\"The Call\\" has some fantastic frenetic drumming from start to finish. \\"Always\\" is the closest thing to a ballad on this record, but the melodies just don't seem to stick.<br /><br />I certainly recommend picking up the special edition with the bonus tracks. \\"Blood Stains\\" is pretty good, and the live tracks are great. Jesse Leach sounds flawless in the live version of \\"Numbered Days\\". It serves as a reminder that he more than capable of re-assuming his role as the lead singer. His crooning voice doesn't sound quite like Howard's, but his screams are ferocious and his lyrics are inspirational and uplifting.<br /><br />All in all, this record may not be as innovative as Alive or Just Breathing, or contain as many memorable moments as End of Heartache or As Daylight Days, but it is very good. These guys are some of the best musicians in metal today and this album reminds us why.
1567184855|4.0|I have to say I definitely recommend this book.  The only reason I did not give a five star review was because there are times when Micheal Newton puts his foot in his mouth.  Or at least I feel he does.  The readings are great, his conclusion of the readings are great but when he injects his personal opinion he comes across narrow minded and some times just plain ignorant.  There were a couple of times I almost put down the book and refused to pick it up again because of some of his idiot opinions.  But I persevered and read on.  Why?  Because the information coming from his subjects was good enough to see the book through.  Some of the things these souls have communicated i have experienced or learned of through dreams or meditation.  Things I have never herd of else ware and I learned or experience them well before I picked up this book.  So I know there is valid information coming from this book!  Some of it really blew my mind away.<br /><br />A couple of  things I was reminded of and will say to you is, everyone has an opinion.  Everyone has their own way of interpreting things so if something you read in this book doesn't seem to jive it doesn't necessarily mean it's false it just might mean that person has a different way of looking at things or they may have experienced it in a different way.  Most everyone hear, on this planet has a lot to learn yet, we are not all going to be correct all the time.  Including Mr. Micheal Newton!  That's why when he said something that totally offended me because I felt it was way off base, instead of casting the book aside I picked it back up and read on and I am glad I did!  Read the book!  It's worth it!
B000002PCS|4.0|It is one of those got stuck in my head that I know I have to buy the CD, play it over and over again until it burns a hole and hoping by then it will get out of my head... lol.<br />Beautiful music, every track, I only wish the recording is a little better, the level is too low, cannot turn up the volume too high.
0062014536|2.0|I did not like all the bad language in this book.  It was also a little too violent.  I just didn't really care for the story.
0307743659|5.0|I vaguely remember seeing this movie years ago and couldn't remember the plot so this book was pretty much a new experience, free of expectations. Stephen King is obviously a pro as he has a way of controlling the pace at which you read and it keeps you flipping through this book. The antagonist is an alcoholic named Jack Daniel...poetic, and there's many more quirky allusions to stumble upon through out the book... and you get to peer into his mind as he goes insane. Even better, these characters are believable. I feel often you read or watch horror stories and find yourself frustrated with the decisions the characters make, but King's characters are believable, though hopefully not entirely relatable else you live a scary life.
006197806X|2.0|This whole story  is just a little bit weird.  There are so many different groups of people to keep up with.  I just really didn't care for it that much.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is a really fun game you should get it is just like mario bros on android with a lepercaun insteas of mario
0062112430|2.0|I was so surprised at all the bad language in this series of books.  If you want your young teen to read this book, I suggest the parent read it first.  The cussing was a little too much for my taste.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Bored and eager to truly just finish it. We get the sex is hot. We get it they're in love. Should've stopped at the first one.
0425263908|5.0|I think the book lived up to my expectations and I can't wait to read the next one! Truly an interesting read that kept me wanting more.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|a good game. unlike otherngame, it require u to control your role well. free is also a good reason. good download it for sure
B004478AS4|4.0|It was good . Very detailed and full of imagery. A great read for all interested. Looking forward to more from this author.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love being able to find out the weather while on my Kindle. This app is great and functions well.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This story is meant for you, and you, and you!  If you lost someone special, if your marriage ended, if you've wondered about your purpose in live, if you've wondered what a more free spirit would do -- guy or girl, young or old, read this book.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is my favorite keyboard for my phone. I used it on my DROID 2 and now on my razr and it is great. The more you use it the better it gets.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Scientology 101 would have been a better title, this movie took so long to develop it was never complete.  Instead of hiding the real story of scientology behind the the title, the producers should have put it right out there, hollywood is so afraid of the back room politics and power brokers.  The movie had great actors, but never really made a point.
B004A8ZX2I|5.0|This is an excellent movie in my opinion. I love Liam Neeson. I got it at a very reasonable price! I would highly recommend this movie.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|One I started reading this, I couldn't put it down! The author did an amazing job of getting into the heads of these people, I could understand why all of the characters felt the way they did in this situation. It shows a lot of different views of people forced to deal with this tragic situation. It seems like most books I've read that deal with this topic always focus on what led up to the event. I loved that this book focused on the families surrounding it, and how they coped. I would definitely suggest this book to people I know.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie  &#34;Paul&#34;<br />I give it 5 stars for comic brilliance<br />I would recommend this movie to  everyone.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I was disappointed that there were no levels, only the same game each time. I like matching games, but with more challenges.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|After listening to Sheryl Sandberg promote her book on a local radio and television station. I purchased the kindle version for my 42 year old daughter who is a Chief Master Sargent in the U.S. Air Force (top 1% enlisted rank in the Air Force). Her remarks about the book and I quote &#34;the book is great. So true and I am learning a lot. 5 stars! Love you and thank you again for it.&#34;
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My entire family enjoys this game. we have unlocked (paid) for all the additional level packs and are enjoying playing through them. I originally played through many levels on the ipad and have enjoyed replaying the same levels on kindle fire. This game has a great &quot;replayable&quot; factor.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Science Fiction and apocalyptic genre are not usually my first choice, but this engaged me in its unique plot. I was truly engaged in the fate of each character. Can't wait to read more by this author!
B009A87X80|4.0|I love Eva Cassidy's voice. It is very soothing a soulful. This is a a nice CD for the whole family.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I got this app because i enjoy classic and retro games that i can play anywhere. This is a basic port of PAC-MAN to a mobile device and you can't really screw up classic PAC-MAN. The only reason it gets four stars instead of five is a personal preference of mine. I find it less enjoyable on a phone because of the small screen so I would reccomend it for tablets such as the Kindle Fire, or any other tablet that uses this market for apps. But thats just me you can still have an enjoyable experience on a phone. So if you enjoy PAC-MAN this is a good port of the original and I reccommend it.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. It's very instrumental and shows off the talents of Justin Timberlake very well. I am impressed and believe this is the best CD of 2013!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a good way to kill time when your need something to do. If you played the first Temple Run then you know what to expect. Run as far as you can without dying. This however does have some new features but nothing to special only some additonal powerups and continues. My complaint is on the screen there is no counter in the corner that tells you what your distance is at all times. If you were a fan of the first game and want somthing new then i reccommend this to you.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I am 61yrs. Old and this is the best new music I have heard in years. There's not a bad song on the CD.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|really fun like diamond dash. you should definitely play it for practice. also it works well boredom. go play it now!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its pretty cool :-) I just wish t would give me more fun so I would be on it a lot
B004DMIIOG|5.0|Was very excited about this order. Can't exactly recall, but I got two day shipping and was delivered on the correct day as promised. Quick shipment, yada yada yada.<br /><br />The movie itself (the important part) is fantastic. I first saw this movie back during my senior year in college as a class assignment. Had to (or I should say &#34;Got to&#34;) write a lengthy paper about it, with many sources. The movie was very engaging, voice acting was great, artwork was gorgeous. I could watch this movie everyday.<br /><br />Stop debating and buy this!
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Why take a great sci-fi movie (\\"Alien\\") and make a look-alike movie that can barely walk?  This movie makes no sense and has holes poking through its holes.  Lackluster acting and crew members that are literally stereotypes of all the folks we've all seen a zillion times before and would never want to hang out with in person.  In a word: boring!!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Helps to pass the time. I like it. I just wish there was....more. lol idk but it's a cute lol game to help pass the time.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This book was humorous and informative historically and made me want to keep on reading to find out what happened right to the end.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Works as advertised, nice to have the mini-usb port open and still be able to to charge using this port.  It snaps on really well and holds very well.  I am not sure if it charges as fast as claimed but it does charge at least as quickly as the other plug in that came with the nexus.
B0087EACJK|3.0|The game is okay but as it gets progressively harder to play and the timer is too short for one to complete a level. The swiping action, the doubletap action to zoom out and moving parts of the screen to solve the puzzle sometimes takes too long and you run out of time too soon making this game difficult to play at some levels. This adds little bit of frustration and you start loosing interest in the game. If you love puzzles and like simple graphics yet challenging levels this game might be good for you.
098478280X|4.0|I bought this book half-way through my senior year of college (Bachelors of Computer Science). I needed a book to prep me for my upcoming software development interviews. This book was a crucial tool in helping me prepare for my interviews and review some of the basics I had forgotten (data structures, algorithm complexity & performance, etc.). Landed the job I wanted. This is a must have for those entering the job market.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Truly an amazing performance by Denzel Washington. Few actors could take such a flawed character and make him so human, and make the viewers so sympathetic to his plight. This movie is worth every minute.
1421550644|5.0|Once I convinced him to give it a try, my 12-year-old son digested this book in about a week. When I told his cousins that I had given it to him, I heard gasps of delight (and a little jealousy). Since it is here, anyone serious about reading the series might as well purchase the entire saga in this magnificent set. I think that many Americans are missing out on the thrills of the Japanese graphic novel. If your kid is already reading &#34;Nate The Great&#34; and &#34;Diary of A Wimpy Kid&#34;, Nausicaa is a great way to encourage reading and get over how thick a book may be. I've only started it myself since my reading list is long, but I look forward to joining my kids in this marvelous story.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|An amazing game! Too bad it randomly erases your progress. Happened twice as i got to the hammerhead.  I deleted it to avoid future frustration.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|I have used many Mahjong games and this is not my favorite that is out there. I have tried other games and I find those other one more entertaining.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I listened to all the books on audio with my kindle, then I saw all the books on sale for $5! Had to have it! Now I can read and re-read all the books before the next movies come out.
B0087EACJK|5.0|This is a lot of fun for all ages. Keeps my 70 year old brain working and as much fun and challenge for the grandkids. And best of all, it was a &#34;free app of the day&#34;!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's fun and a little bit like temple run its more for kids it's fun to have new characters and have cool hoverboards!So everyone enjoy!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|i really like this app...especailly necasue im in high school now and all we use is calculators...and of course we cant take them home:( so when i bought this app it really helped me out alot with algebra homework...but just a word oc advice.....i would add some type of graphing feature .....:)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a sensational book.  Love at first bite.  The main character was just about every woman fantasy. Good Read
B009X01ELC|5.0|Love this case and it doubles as a stand for watching videos. Great protection and quality. I believe this case will last for awhile even with my 4 yr old using it. Highly recommend buying!
0525953590|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. Sean has a wonderful writing style and doesn't try to impress with his genius. Easy for a lay person to understand. I learned a great deal.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I am used to using this app on the iPhone and like you can click on a link and it pops up rather than opening the tweet first. Just spoiled by a better app design.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you guys have the update. I do and if you have a YouTube account please suscribe me I don't have any suscribers my name skythekidrd ok.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's okay, I am an iPhone user so this app on the kindle is lacking in some areas. And when clicking a photo it will often get stuck and I have to push the back button multiple times to get it to close.
B005VPRF9I|5.0|my son loves this plays with it all of the time.  it made him happy.  i am glad you had it in stock
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I get so in to this game that I get startled when I get hit by a train.  Love it.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|The best series ever made for TV.  Highly recommend it for adults--not for children though.  Even old fogies will love<br />this one!
B00003CXB6|2.0|This movie really ruined the JP series.  The original JP was a classic, but this movie is trash because everyone in the movie behaved unreasonably and idiotically.<br /><br />1. Nick: he is probably the worst character of the movie.  He completely disregarded the safety of his friends and his companions for the sake of dinos.  First he let loose all the dinosaurs endangering the lives of the other team.  Then he brought the injured baby T-Rex into the trailer over the objection of his co-workers.  If these actions were still semi-believable, then the fact that he sabotaged Roland's gun while the entire team was already stranded on the island and facing mortal danger.  That behavior was outrageous and he should be prosecuted for reckless endangerment of human lives. In the end, his reckless behavior led to many deaths and he somehow miraculously survived in the end.<br /><br />2. Kelly v. Velociraptor: that scene made me wonder if I am watching a Disney movie.<br /><br />3. Sarah: she is the dumbest scientist I have ever seen.  She firmly believed that Dinos were caring parents, but She nevertheless petted a young stegosaurus while its 5-ton parents were around.  How the hell did she survived in Africa?  Even I know not to pet a gigantic wild animal regardless of whether they are herbivals.<br /><br />4. The useless hunting team.  First, there was a guy who was listening to music while they were stranded in an extremely hostile environment and were supposed to be on high alert at all times.  Then when the T-Rex attacked the camp, the only thing they could think of was running?  They had weapons and could have easily defended themselves.  They did not behave like experienced hunters at all.  They were more like construction workers.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|I chose &#34;It's okay&#34; for my rating simply because it was a fantastic action movie (like all of the Transformer series) but there were just far too many cheesy jokes and innuendos. If the first Transformers movie was made for 18 year old's lets say, then this one was made for 13 year olds.
B00004YZFR|5.0|The Stones are always great, and I especially loved the scenes of them in the studio as well as all the bonus material.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great game!! Have played a couple of G5 takes and this one is really well done. Only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is the price.....$4.99 is a bit steep when other exceptional games are running around$2.99. But, you do get quite a bit for your money. Hard to put down!!!! Thanks G5.... make more like this!!!!
B00AN0KGWE|1.0|I have tried several video rentals with Amazon and most are tolerable, but this time, it was awful with color banding, grainy patches and many times areas that were too dark to see.  I think downloaded videos are the future, but, its not very good for now.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|always played yatzee with family this is my favorite game. number one game of all time. I love playing this game with family and friends even if they are out of state you have to get this game.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Excellent costume drama with superb performances by Sally Field,  Daniel Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. Very similar to the split that divides us now.  I am a student of the Civil war and this was staged with all the hate and vitriol of the period.  It is sad that good people continue sending fools to Washington.  John McCain and Lindsey Graham would have been right at home with the senator of that day.
B001BCRGEE|5.0|How have I missed this one until now? I can't stop listening to this. Adding six more words as required.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Haven't listened to this again since ordering, but looking forward to watching it again sometime soon.  I thought this anniversay performance on live stage was spectacular.

B0060MYM3S|3.0|Everything was going smoothly until disc 3, episode 6. It is defective to put it plainly. I'm uncertain what to do since it is the only episode affected.

B00AW28HF6|4.0|Rating: 3.5 Stars<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about `Tsunami Connection', however part of that stems from my political sensitivities. This book is essentially an action-packed spy novel mostly centered around a Mossad agent named Kefira. I commend the author for weaving so many very recent current events like the coup in Egypt and the civil war in Syria into the narrative. However, being as I'm part Egyptian, I spent the early chapters of the book too emotionally worked up about the references to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and the overthrow of the Egyptian government to really get into the story. However, I don't think the author intended to take a political stance one way or the other, and when I spoke to the author I was reassured that he had already intended to bring in a character to represent the Palestinian perspective into the next book of the series.<br /><br />Fortunately, this book was not about Israel and Palestine or anything like that and the book quickly moved us from country to country and allowed us to visit with people from a multitude of cultures: Indonesia, Argentina, Israel, Egypt, and Russia just to name a few. This must have taken a huge amount of research to accomplish (and possibly even experiences from personal travels). The research was very evident and the author did put a lot of effort into capturing the different traits and habits of various cultures. As someone who really knows Egypt, there were a couple very minor details that struck me as imperfect, but they were so minor even a foreigner visiting Egypt would not notice the discrepancies between the book's descriptions and reality.<br /><br />I did enjoy the second half of the book better than the first as that's when the action picked up (and when I'd gotten somewhat over my initial response to the early references to politics). Kefira seemed to bounce from one Romance to the next at first, but she settled down into one relationship by the end which I appreciated. I alsoliked that the book was being led by a strong woman. I do wish that she was portrayed to be just a touch more competent though. It seemed at times that she was driven more by `instinct' then by skill and she let her emotions get the better of her training more than once in the book. With that said, she was portrayed as being a good agent and I did come to like Kefira. I also liked the mentions of futuristic technology and the use of spy tech throughout. A lot of this technology will probably become reality in the near future (cloaking devices for example) and some of it, such as shape charges, is already a reality (although as far as I know, shape charges are not currently used in the way that the book suggested they could be).<br /><br /> I personally would not read the next book in the series as I don't care to get myself worked up over Middle East politics and cultural stereotypes again, but I imagine that someone who enjoys spy novels and books that take place on a global setting would find this an enjoyable read. Potential readers should note that there are a few adult sexual scenes as well as a bit of violence in places.<br /><br />I am grateful to the author for providing me with a free copy of `Tsunami Connection' in exchange for my honest review.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|This is the Sinatra concert I wish I had been alive for !  Great music, great bantering and dialogue from Sinatra.  If you're a Frank fan, this is a great addition to the music library.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Got this for free. Totally love it. Only 4 stars because of screen size. Sometimes a little difficult to hit the proper button. Overall, lot of fun for FREE!!!!!!
0449000729|5.0|The condition of the 2 copies was as described. I am very pleased. I was aware of the book and already prepared to enjoy it.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Could not stop watching it!!  3D had a lot of depth. Very well done. Great story line and video quality.
0817439390|5.0|Bryan explains in very basic examples how and why exposure works and is important.  He also explains how you can set the mood of a photo with the exposures you choose.
B004XZ99LO|4.0|Although the video was much shorter then Worlds Away, Cirque du Soleil is mesmerizing!!  I can't understand how they do that?
B004HW7JMO|2.0|I am giving to video collection a 2 star because I have really enjoyed the spartacus story and I bought this to watch with someone else.  Guess what the scenes jumped all over the place and kept repeating.  The disk it faulty I guess.  It made it impossible to watch the shows.  I'm too busy to return disks and mess with getting a replacement.  I just left the disk set 3 states away.  Better luck next time self.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Loved this story, just wanted it to last longer, I have long been a fan  of Stephen King, this does not disappoint.
B0072OFM28|2.0|I haven't gotten to watch this set yet.  I wanted to view Gods of the Arena first and the disks I ordered were faulty.  I'm sure it's good I just want to watch prequel first.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It is a amazing book  of something sweet and sorrow put together into one amazing story tale that is retold in proper ways
B004Q7CIFI|2.0|Read this at least twice in the last three years. Enjoy Stephen King, but the author's apology for all the Warren Commission garbage that obviously persists even into 21st century narratives is really depressing and hard to swallow - even in a work of fiction/fantasy. Real evidence simply does not support the lone-gunman version of events. An otherwise readable book (a competent writer) but SK's perpetuation of the lone gunman nonsense is the glaring flaw in this rather sappy, dippy, overly cliched and deeply nostalgic tome. Painful to read those parts where the author vilifies Oswald as the &#34;lone assassin&#34; as opposed to suggesting a more creative and believable scenario. In that respect, the plot lacks imagination, which is generally this author's forte. Especially hard to swallow author's reading list (which he details at the end of the book) for researching the JFK conspiracy, which is a laundry list of Warren Commission apology and all that is just plain bad about that horrible chapter of American history. SK says he's come to the only conclusion that can be had by a reasonable person, regarding the JFK assassination. That Oswald did it, with a crappy bolt-action rifle that no one in his right mind would use to kill the leader of the free world, and he acted alone. Period. Except that the author's wife believes it was a conspiracy. Apparently she's not sane. Just his most trusted, valued reader and chosen life partner? Sure. Makes sense.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is probably one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read! I was laughing one minute and crying the next!  I could almost hear the wonderful Irish brogue! And was so touched by the humbleness of Jamie, and the love his dear friends had for him. Was wishing for more!
B00933JF74|4.0|This game was pretty fun. It stems from a sim city sort of idea, but without the layers.  Fun way to pass the time.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I love this game.  It's the closest thing I could find to lords of the realms 2.  I wish their was a version that you could buy bc I hate having to wait for my energy to refill.  Lots of fun you can join guilds which is awesome. Lots of content great sound.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|As usual, BAldacci comes along with an excellent story about a teen girl who lost her parents to killers.  It is a good read for BAldacci fans.  I would recommend this to them as well as first timers.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A long book, but worth reading.  I can't wait to keep reading in this series! The characters and their lives draw you in.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game was such a refreshing change from some of the other so called dungeon crawlers for Android. Great graphics, smooth controls, nice leveling system... I play Diablo 3 on PC and I feel like this is a perfect mobile crawler. Must play!
B0015DYIH2|1.0|Boring. This book was nothing special i did not like it so i skipped around ........ alot hah but its bad.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I'm not really a big fan of ice age village its a little boring. Not to put the game down or anything!! I'm just not a big fan. It's an ok app for kids and all but not really for teenager's
B005HSL626|5.0|I enjoy playing this game because it is fun and relatively simple.  I really enjoy it.  It is relaxing for me.
B0067R0APK|2.0|I like the new interface but the maps don't work and to me that is a very important feature.  Also, why is the free version newer???
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|I liked watching it, but it was a little long and there were some parts which were confusing to me.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Download and installed...or did it install...?  I can't remember.  All I can remember was errors with it.  That's how memorable this application was...un-memorable...
030758836X|4.0|It's the perfect vacation book--witty, twisted escapism for the beach or poolside. We're talking pure entertainment, folks. Most of the critics claim it's implausible--of course it is--that's why it's fun. Was it a kidnapping, a murder, or something else? The story keeps you turning pages as you delight in the schadenfreude of it all.
B000I9X7M6|5.0|good acting all the way around. couldnt imagine another juliet for romeo, awesome casting!<br />My daughter had to read the book and compared to this movie it was word for word..and more entertaining as well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A great glimpse into life in the English countryside,the impact of WWI in Europe, and stories of human struggles for every class of turn of the century English society. Beautifully filmed, well directed, and  cast of quality actors.  Better than the series Upstairs, Downstairs! Highly recommend for quality entertainment.  Lord Carnarvon's estate is a wonderful feature.<br /><br />T.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|In great condition. Exactly the product I was looking for. Accurate shipping estimate. Would order from this seller again. Thank you
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is super fun and you get to build your own city. You can also expanded your land. It is awesome.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I just can't leave this alone. Spoon addictive, it's worse than...Well chocolate, natch! Actually worse than that, it's like marmite
B0071FBARY|5.0|They never disappoint! I have all of their albums and will always buy their music! Such a unique sound and that's rare these days. Would highly recommend!
0345803493|5.0|Bought this for the wife, she hasnt put it down so I guess thats an A+++. Very fast shipping and this book was brand new. I was very happy. I would highly recommend these people.<br />Cary Lemons
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I am going to see them in Nashville in Sept and have fallen in love with this album! Very unique sound and a high recommendation!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I am having fun playing these games, although getting used to the Rio games is different from the original and the Seasons Angry Birds. I highly recommend this one, but I think I prefer the original and Seasons to the Rio. Maybe when I have played the Rio games a few times, Rio will grow on me. Still, I was ready for something different, and this is different.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|One of their best albums yet!!If you are a Maroon 5 fan then this is a MUST have!!! I also recommend seeing them live this summer!
B002RKSZWG|5.0|Take the time to read & comprehend this one. You will be immensely astonished at the depth of it. True beauty in words.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I was a little bit of a fan from the first single, but decided to buy it when I heard he was going to be touring with John Mayer, my all time fav!! He is way beyond an American Idol talent...they didn't deserve him!!!GREAT album would definitely recommend!!You wont regret it!
B005B0QYMM|5.0|When one hears the words \\"Supernatural\\", \\"Horror\\", and \\"Found-Footage Film\\" in the same descriptor they do not prepare for a very exciting movie. By-and-large because of the low budget it costs to film one you're looking at anything between terrible and merely average, few reaching above this. So as a horror fan it was with no small amount of joy that about thirty-minutes into this movie I recognized this wasn't just a good example of how to do a film in the genre, it's THE example. It's the best found-footage film you'll ever watch bar-none and even makes solid headway into the legion of good horror films in general.<br /><br />The secret? Multiple cameras, decent actors, mostly likable characters, and a distinct style that steps away from enough of the usual horror trappings to be unique.<br /><br />I won't spoil much of the story and scares to be had beyond what you can see in five-minutes but suffice it to say one of the films strengths comes from its setting, a group of paranormal investigators \\"investigating\\". Some people note the beginning of the film as a weakness but I disagree as I felt it built up the characters just enough to care, without being overly long. And at the same time provided the backdrop for giving us the many fixed cameras, and orienting ourselves with who was carrying which mobile camera so that when the action started we aren't confused. Additionally all these cameras mean that we rarely get the \\"shakey cam\\" the genre is so well known for. Eventually things go REALLY wrong and this is again to the films unique credit, unlike a movie like Paranormal Activity the bumps in the night only last about ten minutes in this film, then you're treated to a full-on paranormal experience filled with malice and terror.<br /><br />Beyond this there truly isn't that much story, settling for focusing on the characters descent into this hellscape and though it will depend on your opinion I did not find this a negative. Often a film can lose its horror if the story becomes overwrought or is simply bad, the directors of Grave Encounters realized this and don't give a lot of answers except for a few excerpts throughout, and one (glaringly bad to be honest) scene at the end. This allows them to instead focus on the increasingly fearful characters, most of who are acted with enough skill to make this a valid tactic.<br /><br />Some of the actors are distinctly better than others but none of them are outright bad, with even the worst settling somewhere at average. The same could be said for the characters which is a massive boon for the film. The lead is legitimately believable as a host for a show and as a man scared out of his wits later on, as is the only female character even if her screams become a bit tedious even if they are warranted, the rest of the characters fall below them but a supposed psychic for the show gets special-credit for being distinctly non-psychic when the cameras stop rolling. The only lackluster character is one of the cameramen who moves further into denial the longer the film goes on, while a reasonable emotion to feel they could definitely have expressed this in a better way than yelling, \\"THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!\\" five-hundred times. He's definitely the movies one great and prevalent weakness. A nod goes to the \\"guests\\" for the show before they lock themselves in for the night that do a good job of locals unused to and slightly nervous in front of the camera.<br /><br />Filled with tension, both from legitimate ambiance and jump-scares the film Grave Encounters is not to be missed. It will never get the attention it deserves but this is a textbook example of how one should do a found-footage film, and I most definitely suggest you watch it.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I would totally recommend this artist, such an amazing talent! You will not regret it! Loved his first single, but that song does not do it justice!
1250004217|5.0|i finished this book in two day!  What a great read, a little sad in parts but i highly recommend
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Who wouldn't love the Hunger Games Trilogy, keeps you on your toes. Highly recommend to book lovers and movie people
B00A7OJ0DC|3.0|This movie did'nt quite resonate with me like some of the other's<br />of it's type did, like Cars or the Incredibles. Watching Ralph once<br />should be enough for me.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Agent Pendergast is one of my favorite characters.  I have followed all of Preston and Child's novel's with this wonderful FBI agent. This book was as thrilling as I expected it to be!  I hope Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast comes back again soon!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This was one very enjoyable movie to watch. It had a very good<br />story line, great acting from all concerned and exciting action scenes.<br />I do recommend this movie to all super hero fans.
B0013F1D02|5.0|I love this movie. In 1080 high def it's even more beautiful to watch. A must have for bluray owners.
B003UESJJC|5.0|This is more than just a movie. It's a documentary of a particular<br />time in American history where politics outweighed common sense<br />or humanity. This was a war crimes movie but I've always loved<br />watching it.
1616550414|5.0|This huge encyclopedia is a must have for any Zelda fan. I knew a lot that many gamers didn't know, but this has information even I was unaware of as an obsessed fan. So much information it's overwhelming to take in during one sitting.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This year is really great.  We see the relationship grow with Penny and Lenord.  Sheldon still doesn't have a clue on how to be a people person.  Amy Farrah Fowler still trying to get Sheldon to step it up in thier relationship .  We are starting to see the other side of Bernadette.  She is not the sweet girl we all thought she was. Love to see her other side come out.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|CHRISTINA McKENNA HAS WRITTEN A STORY THAT BRINGS TO LIFE A PERIOD  IN IRELAND THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE AWARE OF AND HAS GIVEN THE READER A TRULY BEAUTIFUL STORY OF LOST CHILDREN FOUND.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The epoisodes are great.  They are focusing on not just Castle and Beckett.  We learn more on how the relationship is going and finding out more about Castle
B00BWJARHO|1.0|This should be an engaging, exciting, and fast moving movie.  The director failed on all three points.<br />This movies adds a lot of things that aren't part of the story.  They don't add to the movie.  It only tells 1/3 of the story.  We had to watch 2/3 on night, and they rest another night because it is too long.<br />They story isn't told, and there really is no point to watching.  I was really disappointed at the end.<br />The character portrayals were poor.<br />The special effects were also poor.<br />My suggestion: you can read the book in less time and enjoy an amazing story.
B005NFYXTG|5.0|The film is clearly a master piece by Pier Paolo Pasolini, a profound analysis of fascism, capitalism, and consumerism, as all of them use desire and sexual drive to abuse those who end up on the wrong end of the table, or in other words, us.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not really into the Scarpetta saga any more. The character is getting old as in the story line with the conflict with Benton, Lucy, Marino, etc is getting stale
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|While in game if I less tools a box wants me to press edit then place one of my storage items in the zoo .... how ever it will not let me or will Hitler's exit the screen ... this is a super game both my kids enjoy it much ....
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Could not believe this cooler dropped my CPU temps 30 - 40 degrees. I went from a closed loop water cooler to this with much hesitating but this one works WAY BETTER THAN MY OLD ONE!!!! Combined with Arctic silver thermal compound it's a winning hand. Might mighty indeed CPU never goes over 107 even playing Crysis almost maxed out. Get it. Do it. Done lol. I also give it ten stars if I could.
B0034G4OYK|2.0|Do not expect a digital copy with a code that will work with iTunes.  I emailed customer support and they are the only movie studio that would not provide an authorization code to download to an iTunes account.  Purchasing movies with an UltraViolet Digital copy is a huge hassle, as you have to go through Flixster - their reviews are not favorable.
B003QSHIPS|5.0|If you wanna impress your friends or dumb girls who don't know anything about music, get a Vinyl and your Grandma's record player. It's really hip and they'll think you're the coolest cat in the alleyway. Wool cap and lenseless black rim glasses not included.<br /><br />What is included is the Gorillaz second best album in glorious high quality and pure aural bliss vinyl. Hewlett's stellar artwork adorns every face of every fold, and it's worth that alone to get this. Gorillaz are art in every facet and the composition of their toons for Album Artwork and promotional material is as good as the composition of their tunes.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game for passing the time traveling in the car, on the train or even<br />at home. Family-friendly and suitable for all ages. Highly recommended.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Play it all the time. I can't put my kindle or phone down sometimes. If you love puzzles get this one.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This full facebook is much better than the mobile version. With it we are able to do all the regular actions including posting. I haven't tried the games on facebook yet but the messaging and view of the page is much better.
0894803123|5.0|I really loved this book!  It gives a lot of information and will start you out, When you learn the basics you will be able to make your own interesting creations!
1401937268|5.0|Unicorns, faeries, angels, rainbows, and dragons! How could you not love them?! There's an effervescent quality to these cards. Wonderful energy, whimsical and enchanting artwork, and I love the affirmations/key words written on each. I've found that they enhance other decks when used in conjunction. For those of you well-versed in Tarot, you'll find them to be refreshing and unique, but still fairly parallel to the traditional meanings of say, Rider-Waite.  They are the most beautiful deck I have ever seen and they are based on the most positive interpretations possible for each card's meaning. My only teeny, tiny complaint is that the cards are large...they are wider than traditional, rectangular Tarot cards and I sometimes find them hard to handle. The are the same size and card stock as Doreen Virtue's other oracle decks. But they still give accurate, powerful readings despite their awkward shape. Where there's a will, there's a way!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|The movie portion of this can get a little slow and bogged down in the politics of the passage of teh 13th ammendment.  However, the acting in this movie is great.  I thought there would be a little more action, so I only gave it a 4.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|So I bought this album very skeptically, I could never get into these guys when I was in high school. This album is flawless. Best album of 2013 so far and I think it will hold that place in my top 5 of 2013. I will be picking their older stuff up at my local music shop this week. Good job BMTH.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I listen to this CD for hours every day and don't tire of it.  These guys are great.  I look forward to more from them.

B0011Z51QG|5.0|I grew up in the 80's and this album was one of my first. It had a profound impact on me back then and continues to entertain me even today. This album is, absolutely, timeless.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the graphics. Its very fun and engaging. I really enjoy it and I play it every chance I get. I love the game and it works very well.
B00B04KVMC|5.0|Great array of artist with great songs. Dave Grohl for president!!!!!!!! Each track is easy to listen to over & over.
B0067R0APK|2.0|Original was simple and great. This is too loaded to make use of in baiting conditions. Please reoffer the original.
