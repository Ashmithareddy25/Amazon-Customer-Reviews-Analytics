B002EWD08Q|2.0|What a complete bucket of suck.  I didn't think it was possible for the Arctic Monkeys to create something so incredibly boring.  Wow.
B001MW0J2O|3.0|I really tried to get into this album, and have listened to it a bunch of times before posting this review.  The indie rock press has just gushed over this album, but there seems to be a love/hate thing going on here with a lot of the reviews.  I would have to say I fall somewhere in the middle - I didn't feel that strongly about this album one way or the other.  Would I call the album overrated?  Probably.  But I can see how some would find this album enjoyable.  The songs are spacey and trippy, and full of strange textures and soundscapes.  The song structures are unpredictable and often progress in completely different directions from how the song started.  A song that sounds cold and desolate at the beginning might randomly burst into loud, joyful noise.  Not really your verse-chorus-verse type of songs.  The problem for me is that I just didn't find any of their sounds all that enjoyable.  There was no emotional connection for me with the songs at all.  Plus, I found the singing to be kind of annoying.  There will be a lot of press proclaiming this the album of the year, or the decade maybe, and I think that newcomers to this band will be very confused.  I've read a few reviews explaining that this album is more of a \\"pop\\" sound for Animal Collective.  I would advise anyone looking for poppy music to steer clear, however.
1439152756|5.0|Excellent condition, very good delivery time.  Recommend book to everyone!  Should be a must read.
0316044695|5.0|This book is great narated by a person that went thru hell to show us the truth of what our military people are going thru. I feel that the book made me feel part of his feeling and I read the book in two days. I highly recommend it.
0689865384|5.0|This book had been on my recommended list for a long time, but I usually only pick up a YA novel if comes highly recommended from a friend.  I came across an advert offering the ebook of Uglies for download and also free.  It was a great marketing tactic, because I am definitely buying the rest of the series and probably the other books that this author has written.  Uglies was a wonderful book, set in a believable and well thought out world.<br /><br />Tally Youngblood, the protagonist, is not exactly the most likeable character that I have read, but her growth and awareness suck you in, and while might not make you love her, breeds respect.<br /><br />In its entirety the novel is well written, the story line is well laid and the characters possess a depth that is usually lacking in most young adult novels.  I also appreciate that romantic entanglements were at a minimum, even though there could have been a lot more.  The author focused on the plot and left the other side plots left up to the reader's imagination.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to teens and adults alike who enjoy sci-fi.  It is a thought provoking book, with of course that main \\"beautiful\\"  theme but also an underlying theme of government interference and conspiracy.  I can't wait to read the second installment.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|i've owned the original megadeth releases of both rust in peace and countdown to extinction, then i saw the remixed and remastered versions in stores and had to get a copy. i don't understand what other people on here are complaining about because it says right on the package remixed and remastered which is what usually is entailed behind the meaning remixed and remastered meaning some elements were remastered while some were re-recorded and whatnot, megadeth surely aren't the first band to use this process. if you ever buy the dualdisc version of nine inch nails album the downward spiral, trent reznor did the same thing. but in either case i think both artists and any artist has the right to do with their music as they see fit, i really appreciate the fact dave mustaine decided to re-record a lot of the vocal tracks as the original were often times incoherent. anyway i give this album 5 stars out of five because it's not butchered at all but a rediscovering of a classic ass kicking album.
B001IUBZAU|5.0|AC/DC is AC/DC & if you like them then<br />you like rock n roll if you don't then<br />you don't! it's that simple. I think this<br />is the best from them since 'for those<br />bout to rock' but that's not to say they<br />put out bad music ever! I didn't buy this<br />right away but wow I'm glad I did. This is<br />real rock n roll! & sorry people but rock<br />n roll is dying except for the few that<br />are still hanging on like Y&T, KISS, UFO,<br />Glenn Hughes, Cheap Trick etc.. you know.<br />sorry but most rock bands today blow! I<br />agree with the guy who says it's as good<br />as back in black. I think better but ...<br />& to the guy who said nothing sticks out?<br />are you kidding? listen to it again! It's<br />brilliant. Young plays riffs better than<br />ever & the songwriting is excellent. I<br />love War Machine, Wheels, Decibel is<br />incredible & Black Ice is just ...wow!<br />I'm just glad that some of these bands<br />like AC/DC haven't given up & at least<br />for now we can still salute 'for those<br />about to rock' so rock on!!!!!
B001FB55H6|5.0|This movie is completely mesmerizing to me.  Dr. Manhattan is of course the most amazing of all the heroes.  I watched the directors cut and it was long but I did not lose interest nor became bored at all.  Blue-ray makes the colors startling.  I recommend this movie to any and all scifi aficionados.
1892005034|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone - I think it helps with all aspects of your life - especially communicating!  It shows you how to communicate without others thinking you are criticizing.  It also explains how to take what others say without getting offended.  A lot of times people say things they really don't mean.  This book will educate you - it has really been an eye opener for me.
0321525655|2.0|Presentation Zen owes more to American evangelical Christianity than to Zen Buddhism. Promoting oneself or one's cause, no matter how artfully, clashes with Zen Buddhism; it fits hand and glove with evangelical Christianity.    A self-concious member of a self-identified elite, the author embeds practical advice in a cloak of Zen metaphors. A reader who wants to learn how to make good, solid presentations can get most of this by googling Simon Peyton-Jones and following the advice in his presentation on how to give a good research presentation.    Of course, Reynolds goes far beyond Peyton-Jones artistically. Presentation Zen is for readers who want to craft a presentation to sell themselves or their cause. But readers who want to effectively share content with peers, Presentation Zen goes too far. Unless the peers also are more intent on selling themselves or their causes than they are in sharing content. In audiences of Presentation Zen speakers, you will hear comments about showmen or \\"drinking the Kool-Aid.\\" These speakers risk losing their credibility and having their audiences disconnect. Reynolds hints at this when he recommends using quotes to enhance credibility: credibility that depends on quotes is rather thin to begin with. Reynolds recommends surprising the audience: surprise them with honesty.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|People who wax philisophical about this being the Golden Age of television arent off in any way.  Never before in my life have I been around so many solidly great shows airing at once.  I'm not saying this is universal, because of course this is also the era of reality TV, but between The Wire, Dexter, Numb3rs, Lost, Californication, etc, etc, I've never before been as excited about what is possible with television as an entertainment media.  I think we have far and away trumped movies as far as overall content and originality.  Movies are all about the \\"remake\\" these days, but shows like Breaking Bad are about as original as you could possibly ask for.<br /><br />I wont really get into too much thematic elements or subject items, because I dont want to spoil one second of this extremely brief Season 1, but Bryan Cranston absolutely hits it out of the park with his portrayal of \\"average middle class dad\\".  He plays it so numb, then breaks bad with such force...I honestly think this is one of the performances of the year.  I'm not overstating this in any way, he's phenomenal.  He makes you so sympathetic to his plight that you really watch each episode absolutely rooting for him to best the challenging sitution he's involved in.  He's the baddest nerd that ever was.<br /><br />Give this show one episode, and you'll be hooked, and go ahead and set aside another six hours to marathon the rest of the series.  Its that good.
0375842209|5.0|This is a beautiful story that brings to the surface all of the feelings a reader can experience!  Mr. Zusak's style of prose is original and engaging in a way that mesmerizes.  I commend Zusak's character development and his ability to get into the head of little girl during this period of history that was so important to the world and to let us see it all through her young innocent eyes.    I have reccomended this book to several friends, and already have \\"The Messenger\\" in my hands and am dying to read it!!

0312330871|5.0|I've read this book and watched dramatizations a number oof times, and yet enjoy it more each time I encounter it.  The theme of punishment of those who caused another's death and yet evaded legal punishment is especially engrossing.  Agatha Christie is the mistress of the twist ending and remains a major influence on what is now known as a \\"cozy\\" style of mystery.
0316776963|4.0|David Sedaris writes humour of the New Yorker, and does so very successfully.  I read one of his articles about a fellow airline passenger who was weeping due to a recent bereavement.  Sederis, initially sympathetic, reminisced about his own past bereavements - mainly broken hearts - and how he had used them to assume a sympathetic persona.  He concluded the article by thinking how his fellow passenger was just a tad overdoing the tears.  It was quite a complex piece, done with pace and humour.  I like it so much I bought this book.   It's a collection of pieces which I presume were articles published separately before.   I committed my usual mistake, and read the book from cover to cover, so that by the end there was a certain staleness and sameness to the articles.   However, in general, I think the first section - dealing with Sedaris' family and youth were very funny.  His family is of Greek origin, his father, sister and brother seem odd enough to provide even a less gifted humourist with material   Sederis himself in gay, and grew up with a lisp for which he went to speech therapy - the first story, about the Speech Therapist, is for me, the best in the book.  He manages to poke fun at himself, at his parents for sending him, and he exacts revenge (after all these years) on the speech therapist herself;  all while keeping the reader interested and on his side. Remarkable.   The second section of the book is a lot less interesting.  He goes to France with his boyfriend, and has funny things to say about the French, about American's in France and about French language and culture.   Even though the humourous tone is maintained, and he tries to be ironic about the `gee-whiz' nature of American's observing the French, I think he falls into his own trap here.    A much better book on this is Adam Gopnick's (another New Yorker writer) `Paris to the Moon'.   Nonetheless, the book is well worth a read.  The humour is sustained and there were several times I laughedout loud.  If you can dip into and out of this book over time, I think it's  very rewarding .
B001FB55H6|4.0|Consistently great picture quality from the beginning (the stubble on the Comedian's face) to the end.  Some color 'ringing/halo' from my Panasonic DMP-BD80 (to a Panny 50' plasma from 7 feet away) for some scenes with Dr. Manhattan and 'Archie'.<br /><br />Still, not quite the PQ levels of 'I Robot' or 'Live Free or Die Hard'.<br /><br />DTS MA soundtrack was awesome.  Hopefully Warner Bros. keeps making the effort to release more discs this way.<br /><br />Heartily recommended!  Near reference-level disc!

B002K0WBXW|3.0|I have three daughters ages 9-14 and I may be a  prude.   I really liked this movie, it's a romantic comedy with quite a sophisticated plot line.  Ryan Reynolds is very convincing as the scion of small town rich folks, who leaves to make his own way in the world.  He returns with Sandra Bullock, his domineering boss, and they announce their engagement.  Its an arrangement, necessary to avoid Bullock being deported, and you know its going to fall apart.  Along the way however Ryan's relationship with his father, with his home-town sweetheart are illustrated, but the easy pitfalls are avoided.  By the end of the film Sandra Bullock's character rediscovers her humanity, the family are reunited with a new respect for each other , and Ryan can return to New York to find out he actually loves Bullock.  I liked the fact that the story line can support the `full-on' New York working life, and not pay undue homage to tradition and down home values.  I thought the supporting cast were good, apart from the grandmother - the lady from Golden Girls - who I thought was given rubbishy dialogue, and idiotic scenes (especially the earth-mother dance in the woods)   I thought Sandra Bullock was unconvincing as the uber-boss, and some of the office scenes were silly, but overall she and Reynolds were convincing. There were moments of great comedy and tenderness during the movie.  As an adult I thought it was very entertaining.    But..... In Ireland, however it carries a PG-12 certificate, so my twelve and fourteen year old daughters asked me to bring them to the movie; otherwise I probably wouldn't have gone.   I was very uncomfortable with the scenes where Bullock is brought to a male strip club on the hen party, which I found crude and unnecessary. I was also uncomfortable with Ryan's family's acceptance of the engaged couple sleeping together - the mother and grandmother say something like ` we're not so naïve as to think that a young couple ..... \\".  In fact, their arrangementbeing what it is, the couple don't sleep together.  While the first could have been cut from the movie, the second issue is such a part of the plot that it couldn't.  My objection then is to the certificate.  I'm not sure what age limit I would put on it, I think fifteen would be the lower limit I would choose.     I suppose the film could have triggered a discussion with my daughters about our family values etc, but I was looking for entertainment from the movie, rather than a moral challenge.
B001AQR39O|4.0|There is a pretty dramatic difference between the 1st Season and the 2nd.<br /><br />The 1st Season of the show was about the existential angst of Hank Moody.  His edgy, angry first novel (and only highly-acclaimed work) has been optioned by Hollywood studios and transformed into a miserably predictable romantic comedy; his former soulmate is set to marry a rich corporate goon; his daughter, mirroring her father, has gone into a dark, teenage funk; and his literary manager, while still Hank's friend, has grown tired of his Hank's inability to produce any substantive work.<br /><br />In contrast, the 2nd Season is about Hank getting virtually everything that he dreamed of ... he has reunited with his soulmate; he has reestablished a strong relationship with his daughter; he has rediscovered some of his literary mojo. But, ironically, despite all of his wishes coming true, he is still a drowning man because he completely unprepared to take responsibility for getting what he wished for. He is haunted by the choices he made prior to all of his dreams coming true. And the realization that he cannot handle what he wished for causes him to meltdown in numerous ways.<br /><br />I believe that this season, which maintained some of the wonderfully bizarrre elements of the 1st Season, actually gives us deeper insight into many of the characters and seemed much less episodic. As other reviewers have said, there may be fewer laugh-out loud moments. But there are substantially more moments that make us consider the choices that all of us have to make in regards to careers, romantic relationships (and entanglements) and friendhips.<br /><br />Bravo, Showtime. Between Weeds, Dexter and this series, we're glued to the televisions!

B00005JKGO|1.0|I NEVER let boredom get in the way, and always watch a picture til its end. I had to take a nap in the middle of this one.  It´s one of the most unbearable, boring films I have EVER watch, and I´ve seen a few (10 in the last week). Lars Von Trier´s \\"Antichrist\\" was pure fun and action in comparison!!!   Once it was over, I saved the case and threw the movie away. There´s not plenty of room in my house...

B00002ZMNV|5.0|Aside from the amazing combo of Metallica music with the full symphony, it is such great fun to watch the classical musicians reaction to the headbangers in the audience.  You just know in all the years these people have performed, they have never had screaming, headbanging fans losing their minds, pressed against the stage and roaring their appreciation.
1439102813|2.0|It was okay, the story was heartbreaking but I felt like the writing was not so good. The writing lacked emotion and depth I felt bad for Alice and her family just because of what was happening to them not because I actually cared for the characters. It might be a good read for people who really have no idea what Alzheimer and Dementia since it contains a lot of \\"facts\\" about the illness but at times I felt I was reading a child's text book. The characters were under developed and flat. I'm glad I borrow this from the library instead of buying it.

B001OQCV2Y|4.0|Let's face it, if you are not a Tarantinoist (I am one), you will not like this film. If you are one, you will like it, but bitch a little bit about this or that. It is too long! (I do not think so!) It is silly in parts! (yes, it surely is, but not all the time, and even some of the silliest jokes have their own charm --- like the Fuehrer asking his body guards for gum.) There is too much talking! (I do not think so at all, the dialogues or larger conversation groups are brillant!)<br /><br />Story: in WW2, a Jewish commando of US soldiers works in Nazi France behind enemy lines, going for the kill of Nazis and taking scalps, led by 'Apache' Brad Pitt, supported by a 'golem' who kills with a baseball bat. Then the plot gets enriched by a big project: Operation Kino, a planned en gros assassination of Nazi leaders during a movie premiere in Paris.<br />Enough told. Good action.<br /><br />The acting: Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine is a caricature, unfortunately. The leader of the cast is, without doubt, the previously little known bad guy, the SS officer with the nickname Jew Hunter. And a secret weapon that works well: Martin Wuttke's Fuehrer is brillant. He doesn't look so genuine, but he does sound like the real one! If you don't understand German and/or have never listened to tapes of the man, go here for a realistic impression of how AH talked!

B000NA28I4|5.0|If you are a fan of the books (which are excellent), you will likely have a lot to say about this film. However, for the dragon loving public, it ranks higher in my mind than Dragonheart or any other film about dragons except Reign of Fire. Personally, I loved this movie. Not everyone can be Peter Jackson, translating books into movies, creating excitement while staying true to the original books. With that in mind, there are elements of the film that truly stand out. Jeremy Irons was superb. The dragon was extremely well done. See this movie, then read all 3 books. It is an uplifting ride through dragon heaven.
0307454541|5.0|This is a really gripping and perfectly turned out thriller, it turns out the first in a series of books by the now deceased author Steig Larsson. It has two of the best characters I have read recently, in Blomquist the journalist and part time detective - and Solander - the strangely silent child/woman.<br /><br />Both are morally ambiguous in their own way - chosing to do things which are right for them, but not necessarily right for society. Blomquist has a weakness for women, while Solander lives outside the law and society completely. She has been in mental hospitals since her teens. However her sullen silence conceals a frightening competency.<br /><br />Their worlds collide Blomquist is hired by a retired industrialist to ostensibly write the family history - in reality it is to find what happened to his grandaughter, Harriet, who disappeared suddenly one afternoon 40 years before. Blomquist takes the assignment as he needs to get out of the city. He has been imprisoned for an article he wrote which turned out to be lies and has been humiliated with a court case. To save his magazine and reputation he moves to the remote island where the Vanger's live to undertake the project.<br /><br />Solander is an expert on research, especially using computers. They meet through Vangar who had already hired her to do research on Blomquist - now she has been hired to work for Blomquist on some strange notes which have turned up in Harriet Vangar's diary. But Solander has her own problems - her legal guardian has had a heart attack, and the new guardian has some strange and disturbing manners.<br /><br />Solander, so used to relying on her own strengths could find herself overwhlemed.<br /><br />The real strength of this book, and it was a real page turner for me, was in the slow development of a the case - the finding of Harriet Vangar, which was complex - however all the details of the story because intertwined beautifully and led to an amazing series of twists in the end which kept you guessing the whole way.<br /><br />I really loved the pure strength of Solander, who was calm, strong, cunning, but utterly moral in her own way. An extraodinary character all round.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the next books in the series!.    I really loved the pure strength of Solander, who was calm, strong, cunning, but utterly moral in her own way. An extraodinary character all round.

1439138311|4.0|As a reader, when I read a novel, especially when I'm 'reviewing' one, in the end, my primary question is: 'Am I glad I spent the time on it?'    As a writer, when I read a novel (or a screenplay, or article, or any other piece of writing), especially when I'm 'reviewing' one, in the end, my primary question is: 'Would I like to have written it?'    In the case of Tóibín's 'Brooklyn', the answers would be, in order, 'Yes', and 'No'.    'Brooklyn' was such a strange animal to me. I write as I speak, as I converse, as I express myself in most ways: pithiness rarely rules the day. So to have such a poignant tale told with such reserve, by way of a narrative that's not that far off point-form...this style of writing is not my default choice. However, perhaps because of its -to me, maybe just to me- unusual qualities in this regard, it found a special place in my heart. Its quirkiness was endearing...and I do not mean that in a patronizing way in the least. (For the record, my heroes are John Irving, Pat Conroy, Mark Helprin and Ann-Marie MacDonald. One of my favourite stretches within a novel would be the first forty-or-so pages of Don Delillo's 'Underworld'. Now *that* is writing.) Yes, I'd be curious to read a 'filled-out' version of this 269-page threadbare novel. Yes, there were times I longed for 'more'. But its charms...and its effectiveness...were beyond question for me. So yes, I'm glad I spent the time reading it, I enjoyed it a ton.    But I could never see writing it. If I tried to accomplish even a short story cut from the same cloth, it would, no doubt, be terribly affected, and if successful, more an exercise in determination than creation. This is no knock against Tóibín; he is a master storyteller, in full command of his talents, and clearly told the tale precisely as he'd wanted to.    At the end, I was squirming, very uncomfortable with what was bound to happen as the story ran out to its conclusion. And backtracking to what had led there, I had toapplaud the author's efforts, his construction, and the care with which he related what he related to the reader.    Having said all that, I'm rather amazed that it was 'twice short-listed for the Booker Prize'. It's good, sometimes great, but not a piece I would say was worthy of that degree of praise. It is an accomplishment, entertaining, thoughtful. But not something that will be remembered with any deep sentiment ten or twenty years from now.    (Personal rating: 8/10)
0060558121|5.0|I have been lending this book to just about everyone I know. This is one of the most extraodinary, beautiful, funny, complex, thoughtful and amazing books I have read.<br /><br />Gaiman looks at what happened to the gods which people brought with them to America  - and then abandoned here - forgot to worship anymore. Where did they go? How did they feel?<br /><br />The story is about Shadow, a man with a half life - in more than one ways. He is in prison for a crime he committed. He survives in jail because he has a cell mate. Low Key, who looks after him - teaches him the ways of jail - and because he knows his wife, Laura, is wating for him. He does his time - but when his wife dies just before he is released, there is nothing for him. He is let out to nothing - and then he meets Mr Wednesday. And there is more to Wednesday than meets the eye. In fact, it turns out he is the American Woden. Another God left behind by the original worshippers - he has become a grifter instead, ripping off banks and convincing young women to sleep with him. Not a great end for a god, but he has a greater purpose - to prevent a war which is about to happen. A war between the new gods of America, Media, Internet, Television - against the old gods - Woden, Easter, nameless ones brought by the first people, anansi, and other African Gods. It is a war, and it will be a dirty war.<br /><br />In the background is Shadow's wife who might be dead, but she has dragged her body out of the grave - neither her or Shadow understand why - but she is there, and she is protecting him -looking after him, even killing for him.<br /><br />So what would happen when the God's finally clash?<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's story is a compelling intertwining of the story of the Gods, with the people who brought them to America. In between Shadow moves - like a shadow - through the landscape - it is though he himself exists in a half life - as though he himself is waiting to be born.<br /><br />Gaiman has hidden so many messages and notes in this book that I have read it a couple of times since picking up more details along the way. He writes for the intelligent reader, one who is willing to enjoy the ride, but find the links as well. So there is a minor note at the beginning where you realise that Shadow's surname is Moon - Shadow Moon - a definite reflection on his character. There is also the complication of realising that the hero's of the Book, Wednesday and Low Key are not necessarily as clear cut as they seem. This is telegraphed in various sections of the book - in Shadow's Dreams, but it is interesting how our perceptions of who they are become affected by Shadow's perceptions - and so there worship and arrival in the country are ignored for a long time.<br /><br />This is more than simply a fantasy book - it is a ripping good mystery novel, and underneath a great story it has enough intelligent writing to really appeal to just about any reader. This book has my highest recommendation!!!ave read it a couple of times since picking up more details along the way.

0142412147|4.0|I loved the first two stories. I think Maureen Johnson's (the first) was my favorite. It was just such a sweet, classic love story. John Green's (the second) was hilarious. The end was great too, even if it was a little abrupt. It was so nice once I got there that I'd have liked it to keep going. A little more kissing maybe! Lauren Myracle's story (the third, and last) was good but just not on the same lines as the first two.<br /><br />The cover advertises the book as \\"three holiday romances,\\" and Lauren's story focused mainly on the main character discovering herself and learning that she can change. I really wish that the romance in Lauren's story was more prominent since Jeb was set up in Maureen's story as such a nice guy. I'd have liked to see his story get more attention. The best part was the end when the characters from all three stories reunited, and we got to see the couples from Maureen's story and John's story after they got together. Overall, a recommended read!
0316010669|1.0|The beginning of the book is interesting, but after that the Author begins flailing around trying to make his points.  Ultimately on the very last page of the book you learn that apparently the whole purpose of his book is to promote his idea that people on trial should be behind a closed door, and communicate to the Judge and jury through \\"...e-mail or the use of an intermediary.\\"  The Author repeatedly demonstrates that he is simply trying to use his influence to push a globalist agenda.
B00164GDD2|1.0|Owners of the first generation Blu-Ray players such as the BDP-1400 beware - the disc will likely not play back at all. Samsung's official venues for customer service and support, including live chat, cannot relay with any specificity the release of a firmware update that will correct this issue. I understand that this Blu-Ray release from Sony is top-notch; sadly, the lagging and dragging of feet by some Blu-Ray machine manufacturers have kept me from discovering this for myself.
0316066524|5.0|A sprawling, vast, novel that is set mainly in a tennis academy and a substance abuse and depression recovery institute.  Covering many ranges of personalities and experiences, it is a book that will be reread over and over again.  Each reading brings out new aspects of this amazing book.  Both absurd and realist, it is a novel for the new century.
0767821629|4.0|The Thirteenth Floor (1999) was a very interesting five star film which had to compete in 1999 with the Matrix.  Good computer effects, fine acting and a plot which rivals that of The Matrix, sci-fi fans should make a point of seeing this one. As you would expect, it treats the nature of reality vs virtual reality worlds using a very plausible plot.<br /><br />Briefly, two close computer scientists work to develop a grand virtual world with personalities living within the code.  They explore this world only to find their sense of reality challenged.  To say more would be a spoiler. My only complaint is that I had a hard time following the plot at times if I didn't concentrate on the story.  Overall, a really good film.
B001DF68MA|4.0|[...]<br /><br />Back in Spring we got him a WeeRide LTD seat. This fits between the handlebars and my seat.  (There is also a non-LTD version with less padding. Both versions are sold with the mounting bar included; the separately sold bar is only for a family that wants a second one, to be able to quickly move the seat from one bicycle to another.)<br /><br />It works great. But there are a large number of caveats.<br /><br />First, it does not fit every bicycle. The Amazon reviews make clear that some people had to return it for this reason.<br /><br />Second, I am 5'4\\" and it just barely fits comfortably. Anyone smaller than me would probably have problems. I did not have to change how I pedaled, or where my knees where.<br /><br />Third, the 5mm hex key it comes with is so poorly machined it does not work. Anyone ordering the seat should also buy a hex key set if they do not already own one.<br /><br />Fourth, my leg length allows me to normally stop the bicycle without hopping off the seat, simply pointing one foot tiptoe to rest while stopped. Anyone used to hopping off the seat when stopped would obviously have to change habits.<br /><br />Fifth, my fitness level and bicycles number of gears allow me to bicycle up even the steeper hills I would ride on without standing. I never had the habit of standing while pedaling up a hill. I have not tried standing while Smiley is in his seat, but from the Amazon reviews apparently this does not work.<br /><br />Sixth, the harness system is odd. Smiley can twist out of a shoulder strap, as he did in the above picture when smelling roses at the Owen Rose Garden. I assume this is intentional. If, heaven forbid, I was to crash then having the toddler firmly stuck in the seat is probably not the best option. But a wiggly child who does not follow instruction would need a different bicycle seat.<br /><br />Seventh, the child can grab the handlebars. Smiley does not try this while I hold them, but if I let go of one to adjust my MP3 player or blow my nose he sometimes does. Be alert for this potential source of swerving!<br /><br />Eighth, the routes I might bicycle are all on streets and paths kept clean of gravel and debris. By using a bicycle seat instead of a trailer, I am betting that my likelihood of crashing my bicycle is less than a motorist's likelihood of hitting my trailer. If I lived near gravel roads or where autumn leaves sat damp and made slipping a danger, a trailer would be the better choice.<br /><br />Ninth, there is no hole in the seat large enough to pass a cable lock through. Where I live I am not worried about the seat disappearing while the bicycle is locked in front of the library or a store. In other locations this might be an issue; the seat comes off quickly and easily but is very bulky to carry around while doing errands.<br /><br />Tenth, pediatricians currently recommend that babies under a year of age not use any bicycle seat or trailer. Their brains still slosh around too much for that kind of vibration to be safe.ential source of swerving!

B00065EB2M|5.0|Apollo 17 was a great five star DVD by Spacecraft Films documenting the final Apollo mission to the moon from inception to splashdown.  The features offered by this box set include: alternate views and perspectives of launch (i.e., view angles), excellent quality voice tapes and good quality 16 mm films from the interior of spacecraft and the surface of the moon, all recorded TV transmissions from the moon, etc.<br /><br />The coverage provided by this DVD shows that we really had the business of flying to the moon perfected and then stopped going.  You can witness TV of the astronauts literally falling over each other to get their busy work schedule completed. Their dedication and enthusiasm in completing their chores is unmistakable and an inspiration. It is also obvious from the TV coverage that an improved mobility spacesuit was sorely needed and probably still is.
B001YB29HG|5.0|One of the few benefits to the recent writer's strike is Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. Joss Whedon, Neil Patrick Harris, Felicia Day, and Nathan Fillion are brilliant in this send up of comics, superheroes, and video blogs. And the commentaries are worth the price of the DVD, especially Commentary: The Musical. If you liked the Buffy musical episode, or just have a slightly dark and twisted sense of humor, this is for you.
1423101499|5.0|This is the 4th book in the Percy Jackson books series.  In this book, Percy Jackson and his friends:Annabeth,Grover, and, Percy's cyclops brother, Tyson go in a Labyrinth, created by one of the most famouse architects in the world: Daedalus, to stop Luke, Percy's old enemy from being able to navigate the maze to invade Camp Half-Blood.  On the way out of the labyrinth, Grover finds the Lost Wild god, Pan.  You must read the book to find out more.  I would reccomend this to everybody because this book and the series is: Funny, Full of facts, and of course full of adventure.
B001NESPHC|5.0|I'm not into female vocalists, at least not any current ones.  I listened to Nora Jones and she was okay, but I just discovered Melody Gardot on Amazon and my life has changed.  This is the most talented, sophisticated, soulful, melodious and inspiring singer I have heard since Edith Piaf.  Melody has an intimate, yet breezy voice with nuance and style that has to be heard.  I did not think I would ever hear a voice like this again in my life.  I think I'm in love.    If you like jazz, New Orleans, a beautiful voice, a very tight band and orchestra, and just a very unique and sensuous and original talent, then this is the girl for you.  Melody Gardot!!! Please make more recordings, fast!!!
1423321650|5.0|To write a review on just one book, the second in a series of 11 (12 if you include Debt of Bones), would be unfair.  I found it difficult to understand some of the elements of the story until I read later books, and realized that Terry wound the story so masterfully that even though there are many books they are one seemless story.  This is without a doubt the best series I have read.
B002MJV75O|5.0|Dawson's Creek is a series that I grew up with.  Like \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" \\"Six Feet Under,\\" and \\"ER\\" - it was a story that I absored every week.    In 1998 when the series premiered on the now defunct \\"the wb\\" I was 10 years old.  But having been helped raised by my much older siblings I had an afenity for the older crowd.  After \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" moved to her new night, I stayed and watched a new world open up in front of me.    \\"Dawson's Creek\\" may not have been the first teen soap, or maybe even the best.  But it was the first one I was ever exposed to - and the one I watched throughout my teenage years.  I might not have understood it the first time around the block (a second viewing several years later proved just how naïve I had been throughout several storylines) - but it is a series that remains, even to this day - timeless.  It is the story of innocence evolving into adulthood.... What happens when emotion, passion, hormones, and social standing begin to define who we are?    \\"Dawson's Creek\\" traced the lives of five high school friends from their very first day of High School until the middle of college.  It chronicled their scholastic achievements, romantic fallies, hormonal hijinx, and unique perspectives.  For 128 episodes millions were glued to their TV's every Wednesday night to watch the next installment.  And as an audience we grew up with these characters.    Sony is collecting together all 128 episodes in one box set.  Details are still unavailable.

B001QTXM5Y|4.0|Previous reviews for this film seem very polarised.   Certainly I agree with the widely held view that this film is best suited to comics fans, rather than the general public.   For those of us familiar with the original work of Graphic Fiction (rated by Time Magazine as one of the 100 best ever fiction novels) Watchmen provides much of what any experienced cinema-goer might expect of a well executed adaptation of a previously published work. The story is abbreviated and some story elements changed to produce a more pleasing cinematic experience, and that inevitably will have offended some purists, in the same way they were probably offended by certain story changes in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings.   The characterizations are, happily, dead-on accurate. Rorshach and Dan Dreiberg in particular. While some have criticized the acting in the film as \\"wooden\\", all the actors, regardless of their individual ability, manage to create believable characters that slot well into the structure of the story.  Dave Gibbons' role as on set advisor throughout the filming of Watchmen has obviously paid dividends, with the look and feel of the film evoking nicely the themes of the original Graphic Novel.    My best hints to potential viewers of this film are comparative in nature.   If you enjoy densely plotted, multi-layered suspense or noir you should check this out.  If you enjoy political satire you should check this out.  If you enjoy superhero cinema, as more than just action filled special effects romps, then you should check this out.  If you enjoy films that push or break boundaries or thematic taboos then you should check this out.  If you are a fan of modern comics and graphic novels then you should check this out.  Everyone else needs to be advised that this is a big, densely plotted and slow paced examination of the principle's of good and evil within our society, mirrored in the rag-tag collection of miscreants that populate the \\"super\\" group depicted in this film.Please note they may each be \\"super\\", but not necessarily a \\"hero\\"!    If you are looking for a light-hearted,smash-bang special effects laden action-fest then I suggest you look for it elsewhere. This film's themes are darker, and nastier, than most people expect and it can be a dreadful shock to the system for any dull-witted members of the \\"fluffy bunny brigade\\" that accidentally encounter it.    This is an adult drama/suspense/action genre-bender of a film.  Without wanting to sound stuck-up, unless you have enough smarts and sophistication to want to see cinema that can challenge as well as entertain, then you should probably stay away from this title. Apologies if this sounds snooty.    The number of non-sensical one-star negative reviews I am seeing for this film, from viewers whose chief problem with the film appears to be that there were not enough action sequences, is both disheartening and bewildering. There is even one guy who didn't understand the film and wants it cut to an hour and a half. Unbelievable. If he didn't understand the film with all the masses of exposition that it contained then how on earth does he hope to understand it any better with half the movie left on the cutting room floor? A one-star review for a film because you came home from work tired and couldn't stay awake while watching an epic? COME ON! The film-makers may be responsible for producing a work you don't understand, but they are not responsible for your sleep-deprivation.    I personally dug the book and I like what they have done with the film adaptation.    This joins the top echelon of film adaptations of comicbook properties. Watchmen is greater than the sum of its parts, just like Road to Perdition, Ghost World and Iron Man. Let's hope future comicbook movies are handled with as much love and respect by their creative teams.
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|This is a very well made toy. If the darts jam load just one dart.
B001TH28EO|5.0|This 46CD-set is a reissue of the complete Brahms edition that was released in 1996 to commemorate the centenary of the composer's death.  The original edition was divided into eight lavishly designed boxes and the liner notes contained well-researched essays on Brahms the composer and the man as well as a wealth of historical photos.  As such, it was a highly valuable collection both artistically and informatively.  Unfortunately, that edition has long been out of print.     The current reissue cannot compare with the original edition in two very important ways.  First of all, it does not have any liner notes or any form of literature.  No documentation, no photos.  In the booklet you get nothing except the track listing.  Secondly, it does not provide any texts to the lieder and the choral works.  This can be a major drawback for people who are serious about the lieder.  So, unless you already have another collection of Brahms lieder with all the texts, you might not want to consider this set as your only choice in this repertoire.  Other than that, this reissue is a wonderful comeback to the catalogue.  At the price being asked, I don't see why a Brahms lover should pass it up.  Even if you are only marginally interested in this composer, this set will provide you with endless joy of getting to know one of the profoundest musical outputs by any person in history. :D     As the other reviewers have commented, this collection is indeed a mixed bag.  The performance quality ranges from okay to excellent.  It has some award-winning performances as well as mediocre ones.     CD 1-5: Orchestral Works.  All four symphonies are played BPO under Karajan in early digital sound.  These are Okay performances in my opinion.  Abbado conducts the two serenades.  The orchestral performance of the complete Hungarian dances by Abbado and VPO is excellent.     CD 6-8: Concertos.  For the piano concertos DG used the Pollini/Bohm/Abbado recordings, previously available as a 2CD.  The violin concerto is done by Mutter, Karajan and BPO, and the double concerto features the same combination plus Meneses at the cello.  This recording was previously available in the Karajan Gold series.     CD 9-19: Chamber Music.  In my opinion this part of the collection is a gem.  The performances are excellent overall.  The cello sonatas by Rostropovich and Serkin are highly acclaimed.  The piano quintet by Pollini and Quartetto Italiano won that year's Grammophone award.  The piano trios and piano quartets feature Tamas Vasary, a wonderful pianist who has been underrepresented on CDs.  The Lasalle Quartett plays the string quartets, while the Amadeus Quartett together with Aronowitz and Pleeth play the string quintets and sextets.  Karl Leister plays clarinet in the sonatas accompanied by Jorg Demus.  In the clarinet quintet Leister plays with Amadeus Quartett.  The various quartets, quintets and sextets were previously available in a Collector's Edition box.  Zukerman and Barenboim play the violin sonatas.  DG omits the viola sonatas because these are the same materials transcribed from the clarinet sonatas.  Nevertheless, the viola is nice to hear, and I recommend this recording of [[ASIN:B000G5SISK Brahms: Viola Works]].     CD 20-28: Piano and Organ Works.  The piano performances are good in general.  Op.10, 79, 116-119 are played by Kempff.  These recordings have won numerous awards, although they are not my favorites (Check out Afanassiev [[ASIN:B0000034SI Late Piano Works]] on Denon).  Vasary plays Klavierstucke Op.76 and the Paganini Variations.  Ugorski plays the three piano sonatas.  Barenboim plays the Schumann Variations and the Handel Variations.  The Kontarsky brothers play all the works for piano four hands and piano duet.  These include the Op.39 waltzes, the Hungarian Dances, and the Haydn Variations for two pianos among other things.  Hearing the Sonata in F minor (transcribed from the piano quintet Op.34) played on two pianos is a revelation!  Peter Planyavsky plays all the organ works.  This is interesting music totally worthy of investigation.     CD 29-43: Lieder, Vocal Ensembles and Choral Works.  The lieder performances feature two of the best vocalists in DG's roster, Fischer-Dieskau and Norman.  The accompanist in all of the songs is Barenboim.  In the vocal works for multiple voices we have Edith Mathis, Brigitte Fassbaender and Peter Schreier, all accomplished singers, joining forces with Karl Engel and Wolfgang Sawallisch at the piano.  In the choral works there is North German Radio Chorus.     CD 44-46: Works for Chorus and Orchestra.  The German Requiem is from a 1987 live recording conducted by Giulini and performed by VPO and the Vienna State Opera Chorus.  The soloists are Andreas Schmidt and Barbara Bonney.  The Alto-Rhapsodie is sung by Fassbaender, accompanied by Tschechische Philharmonie under Sinopoli.    As my title suggests, this edition may not be truly complete.  The Brilliant Classics box has 60 CDs compared to 46 here.  So there has gotta be some omissions in this box (e.g. the viola sonatas).  Perhaps someone who has acquired both sets can enlighten us with more information.
0307269981|4.0|A co-worker let me borrow her book to read and it starts out kind of slow but it gets better and better.  I'm almost done with it and can't wait to finish it.  It's a good book.
B001993Y2C|3.0|Battlestar Galactica is a great series!     Since this is a fairly new series, and after reading that the entire series was filmed in high definition, I was expecting a really clear sharp picture and great audio. I was imediatly disapointed when I began watching the first disc. The picture quality is not good. It is grainny and the colors are less than brilliant. Others have justified this by saying that the series was shot this way on purpose and that the poor film quality was an artistic expression. Whatever the reason, it is so grainy and dim that is slightly distracting. I have season three on DVD and have compared the two formats. The DVD is definetly less sharp which masks some of the grain. I am not really sure which format I prefer, not a big difference.    The packaging is another issue. At first I thought the box looked cool but after a few days I decided it was just too big. It wastes a lot of space on the shelf. In fact it partialy hangs off the front of my bookcase. It is at least five times bigger than it needs to be. There are Four individual boxes, each containing a season. I thought about throwing away the big box and just displaying the four smaller ones on the shelf. The big box is sturdy and well put together but the small boxes are cheap and crappy. Its hard to get the discs in and out of the cardboard sleeves. It seems inevitable that the discs will begin to get scratched over time and with repeated uses.    The discs are not labeled so searching for an individual episode could take a while. \\"Caprica\\" is not include, nor are the webisodes.    On the good side, the audio is very good. The Blu-ray discs have more episodes than the DVDs which means less changing disks. \\"Razor\\" is included. It is nice to have the whole series all together, especially since I did not previously own all of them. You also get a toy Cylon figure which is only cool if you wanted it. I would preferred to let them keep the figure and knock ten dollars off the price.    Inconclusion I would recomend that you buy this set if you are a Battlestar Galactica fan and if you don't already own it on DVD. If you do own one or more seasons on DVD I would recomend that you fill in the gaps with individual seasons of Blu-ray sets when they become available and only replace your DVD's if you feel it is worth the extra money.
B001LF4ARC|3.0|Hi,    I found this book by mistake. In that moment I was a brand manager in México for a French organization. I never imaging that this book was so interesting because let you improve your capabilities as a brandmanager.    Before this book, I thought that the loyalty to the MAC rpoducts was only Marketing. After read this book, I understand the complex strategy and effort of Steve and his team.    This guy is not Henry Ford. But in my opinion, the author let you see his strenghs, its weaknesses between differents situations and the kind of decisions and ...maybe this guy is so close to create that kind of change that ford did last century.    Enjoy it!!    Valenzo
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I sure don't expect literature from a SEAL, smart as they are. Anyway, it's a far, far better effort than that phony Dan Brown, who does claim to be an actual writer.    This story SHOULD be told, remembered, and honored. We must be grateful for those who, every generation, willingly sacrifice and endure great hardships so that we can sleep snug and safe at home. Period.     I found it interesting, those who got so annoyed by the \\"Texas thing\\". Fellas, Texas just ain't like any other state and that's a fact of life anyone who steps foot on our soil will quickly realize. We were our own country once and reserve the right to be so again, if we choose. That and our size, natural beauty, strong work ethic, wealth of diverse and good people--it all does lend a bit of understandable pride. Whether you were \\"born here or just got here as fast as you could\\", it quickly becomes Home, center of all things Good and Right. And small-town folk understand it better than anyone: No man is an island. Heck, I live in the city and am always gratified by the helpfulness and compassion of neighbors, friends, and ordinary people in times of trouble, large and small.    As for the politics, you need not agree, but it HAS become a fact of life that soldiers, daily surrounded by would-be bombers passing as civilians, roadside IEDs and never having a clear shot to fight back DO hesitate to shoot for fear of what can happen to them in the media and by their own military if they're wrong. And they wind up dead.    Read and learn, and hope the ROE has changed for the current go-round.
0385342020|3.0|Let me first say that I really enjoy Sophie Kinsella's books.  So it was a disappointment to not like this book nearly as much as \\"Remember Me\\" or \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\"  It's one thing to have an annoying character in a book because we all deal with annoying people in our own lives.  However it was very hard to get into this book because both of the main characters were equally annoying and childish.  Sadie acted more like a willful 12 year old with no manners then a twenty something.      Some of the scenes that were suppose to be funny like the restaurant scene where Sadie kept asking if the man at the table was , \\"your lover\\" were really more along the lines of cringe inducing.      It was a fresh idea that really could have gone far if there had been some better editing.  If there had been more scenes like \\"The Great Lara\\" or Lara asking out a total stranger at Sadie's urging this could have been a really great book instead of just an OK book.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|This is the worst half of a movie that I have seen this year.  It was such a load of garbage that I couldn't make it through to the end. The friends that told me that I had to see it later told me that I didn't miss much. What in the world is all the hype about with this graphic novel & movie anyway? JUNK. I also get a kick out of those who have WAAAAAAAAY over analized this movie - it cracks me up. So in a nut shell - don't waste your time or money on this Slow plot, foul mouthed TRASH.  This takes the Super hero genre to a new low.
B0015YGA0Y|5.0|After listening to the songs from the Arde el Cielo CD for more than a year and so so so many times.. I finally bought the DVD and it was just awesome to finally see the actual concert from which the songs were recorded!! To finally see the crowd and when the artists made all the comments to the fans in Puerto Rico, its was just sublime after having heard it so many times...  Its recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1 so at least with my home-theater it actually sounds better than the CD, just make sure to select the surround option from the audio settings in the DVD menu... The songs were hit after hit after hit... Just wish there had been even more lol, but for $13 how can I complain, this is an amazing buy! Great DVD for true Mana fans!!!
0783227434|5.0|Entertaining movie.  Takes us back to when we were younger and movie effects were not so realistic.
0861714911|5.0|This is an amazing work of easily accessible wisdom. That's not to say it's simplistic or easily understood in its entirety.  Bhikkhu Bodhi has created a very well translated, and perhaps even more importantly, a very well organized collection of the Buddha's teachings. Separated into sections that are not found in the original sources, this book is organized to cover teachings and ideas concerning a related topic or theme (such as the human condition). This organization was very helpful for me and probably will be to others: it accommodates a very western, modern approach such as we might find in a \\"self-help\\" book and yet the sections are composed of unassuming, ancient wisdom from the Buddha himself.    On that note, the Buddha's teachings were passed down orally and written later, the Pali Canon being one of the earliest recordings. Therefore, the teachings collected here are perhaps closest to the Buddha's own words (as the title suggests) and also subject to the repetition found in oral traditions. Bodhi has in many cases cut or condensed these repetitions to make it easier to read - this can be either very helpful (when large blocks are repeated and we may find such extensive repetition confusing or distracting) or disruptive when the repetition is shorter (and the repetition could help reinforce an important message). Whichever way you may feel in coming across these passages, Bodhi makes his changes obvious and explains his methodology in the introduction so the reader understands what he is doing and exactly where he is doing it.    Bodhi begins each section with insightful introductions that explain the context of the included readings and provides some insight into their meaning and interpretation. His introductions are usually several pages, and I appreciated them as about the perfect length in each instance. While not critical to understand the Buddha's teaching they provide a nice element to the overall organization of the work along with a more academic analysis of the teachings.    The topics covered in this work are core elements of Buddhist theology and it is both an excellent source for someone new to Buddhism or a longtime practitioner. While Buddhism is a unique religion, the teachings can be interpreted in different ways, and so I highly recommend this work to those of different religions since the wisdom this book contains can be highly informative and helpful even to adamant Christians, Muslims, atheists and so many more.
0307588335|1.0|This book is mistitled.  It should be titled. \\"A Colossal Waste of Time.\\" It is not an inside story about Lehman Brothers but rather an autobiography of some guy no one has ever heard of or cares about.  Substantially more pages are devoted to the author's youth and college years than are devoted to the history of Lehman, a complete bio of the CEO Fuld, or even much about the financial system in which Lehman operated.  The author clearly wanted to tell the world his life story. He did so in a poorly written, mistitled cure for insomnia.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|This series is the best one on WWII and it is doubtful that someone will make one better anytime soon. The one thing that will keep this series status as landmark is participation of real people from WWII like Holocaust survivors, Nazi figures like Speer, Denitz, Himmler's adjutant Karl Wolff or allied figures like Lord Mountbatten. Most of them are dead so any new series would have to go without them. Documentary material is good and unless someone unearthed something new in the past 35 years then there is nothing to add in this department. Unlike other WWII series covering one country only or just war battles, this one is offering extensive coverage of life during war in Germany, Japan, Great Britain, America, Russia and Netherlands. Thanks to this we know why Great Britain had better war economy than Germany and how America achieved unprecedented industrial production that ultimately crushed Germany and Japan. Without Americans, Churchill would permanently move to Washington DC while Stalin would wage guerrilla warfare against Germany on Kamchatka peninsula.    Unfortunately, this series can't be called definitive as many imply because there are serious shortcomings like trying to cover too many topics in just 26 episodes. Many people point out that various countries, battles or even outcome and cause of WWII were not covered in depth or not at all. It is hard to understand why Jeremy Isaacs never attempted to film more episodes after initial success of series. He admitted himself during interview that he missed a lot of events that should have been covered. Major problem with this series is that it was filmed at the height of Cold War in early '70s. There are many references to Vietnam and in general USSR and Stalin were presented in positive way. Looking from today's perspective this is quite laughable. Not once they mentioned 13 billion dollars lease Roosevelt gave to Stalin. Just imagine having 13 billion dollars in 1941 and what can you do with that money. Ifound on BBC web site that Russians obtained 450,000 trucks from Americans during WWII! One of German survivors from Berlin remembers Russian soldiers being full of chocolates. If she knew English she would probably read Hershey's on chocolate bar label. Where would Russians got chocolates? In Siberia maybe? It was not mentioned that beside T34 tanks Russians used Sherman tanks. After WWII was over, Stalin sent Sherman tanks to capture Teheran and Iran. Just imagine that irony! It is true that Russians fought heroically but was it because of patriotism or because of fear of Stalin and KGB. Series never mentioned KGB checkpoints around Stalingrad that prevented civilians and soldiers fleeing from ruined city. Anyone trying to flee was machine gunned to death by KGB. Russians worked and fought like slaves under Stalin's tyranny. Series never mentioned Stalin's order to imprison in gulags and then execute all those who surrendered to Germans or collaborated with them. Russians were mercilessly killed by Hitler and Stalin with no way out.    What we learn after 26 episodes is that appeasement to fanatics and lunatics lead to war. If France and Britain were pro-war in 1933 then Hitler would ended his career long before 1945. Why they let him rearm German army, take occupied Rhineland by French without a single shot fired and then sacrificed Austria and Czechoslovakia is still hard to understand. Even after their declaration of war to Germany in September of 1939 they stood still waiting for German army to attack them. We all know what happened later. One French general said in 1919 that WWI didn't end then but only provided 20-year armistice. Germans never felt defeated and that's why they started WWII to rectify their mistakes and finish their game from first war. Similar thing happened with the end of Cold War with collapse of Berlin wall 20 years ago. NATO tanks never arrived in Moscow and there was no NATO flag on top of Kremlin. Russians including Gorbachev still think, as Germans did, that they didn't lose Cold War. New fearless leader of Russia Putin is concerned about Russian minority in former Soviet states. He pledged their protection openly, being short of call for reunification. America and NATO these days try to appease Putin just to avoid any confrontation. Belarus will become Austria, Ukraine Poland and Georgia Czechoslovakia. Are we going to make the same mistake from 70 years ago?
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I bought this flash along with Nikon D-90.  I've used it during our trip to Colorado, and it works flawlessly.  It improves the lighting of the pictures, especially indoor portrait using the build-in bounce card.  The wireless remote features was fun to use, it can create cool effects and help improve the background lighting.  The flash auto-zoom feature works great.  IT reach out and light up the objects tremendously.      I am still playing around with this flash to improve picture quality.  But I am glad that I have it.    I also notice a big improvement on taking pics since the light source is higher up.  When I use the build-in flash of the D-90, sometimes it produces shadows of the lense and the hood. This is not a problem with and external flash.    It is a bit bulky, but it is a good comprimise for the great flash.  Was thinking about buying the sb-600, but I thought that I'm going to only buy 1 flash for now, and I might as well buy the best one out there. But it fits great in the camera bag that I have.  Definitely need to think about that when purchasing.    Still going to learn more features of the flash, especially when I have multiple of these.  Works well with the commander mode of the D-90.    I highly recommend this flash if you think you need an external, more powerful flash.
0765348780|4.0|This is the first book in a 10-volume series (eight of which are currently published). It's an epic fantasy spanning a world and with a myriad different characters. There are several maps, lists of dramatis personae, and glossaries to help you navigate this intricate world. It would be daunting to someone new to the fantasy genre, and on someone less so to a fan (like me).    Until relatively recently, I resisted getting involved in multi-volume fantasy series -- at least those that expand beyond a trilogy. But that all changed when I started George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series (4 published, 3 to come). Got hooked there. I also got hooked on Jim Butcher's Codex Alera series (I've read 2 of 6 so far). Erikson has been compared to Martin because both are not afraid to kill off main characters (both good, evil, and somewhere in between). But these three, Erikson, Martin, and Butcher all have very different writing styles. Erikson's style is less straight-forward than the others. With Martin and Butcher, following the plot and the character's motivations doesn't tax your brain. But there is so much going on in Erikson's world. It's a little much at first but then a third of the way through this book, it begins to get clearer. And his use of sorcery in the story is heavy, detailed, and fascinating.    It's a strange place -- maybe not as strange as China Mieville's Bas-Lag, but wonderfully strange all the same. And the characters are wildly diverse as well. But they could use some more fleshing out. Of the two dozen or so that I followed through this tale, I was only getting a clear picture of four or five of them. But I found the whole thing to wickedly engrossing. I love some of the weirdness he puts into this tale, like, for instance, a sorcerer who ends up having his soul transferred into a marionette. Think Chucky with wizardly powers. In this series the Malazan empire is hellbent on world domination but that is neither easy nor assured. Who knows howlong it will take me to get through this series, but I'm looking forward to doing so.    One thing I gotta add is that Jeez Laweez, but these Malazan covers are cheesy-looking! I mean, look at this one, is that guy sporting a mullet?! Sheesh. And, Book 3 looks like it may have the worst cover. I'd be embarrassed if I cared enough.
B0024F08RO|4.0|I have adored Prison Break for the 4 seasons it was around and I understand its all over now, but what a ride. Its sad that such an original show had to end, but its understandable. I believe its ended on the right foot. There was no where else for the creators and producers to go with the story.<br /><br />Glad that I now have the DVDs to keep my Prison Break fix moving forward.
B00005NTJK|5.0|FOR THE RECORD (NO PUN INTENDED), I WITNESSED TULL IN CONCERT THREE TIMES AT THE MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM IN SAN ANTONIO BACK WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE THREE BANDS PLAY BACK TO BACK FOR MANY EVENTS HELD IN OUR FAIR CITY.  BENEFIT, AQUALUNG AND THICK AS A BRICK.  1970 - 1973  PROGRESSIVE ROCK AT ITS FINEST.      ON THE STAGE THAT CERTAIN NIGHT WAS A PRECISION INSTRUMENT IN THE FORM OF FIVE YOUNG MEN WHO MESHED SO INTENSELY ON EVERY NOTE, EVERY DRUMBEAT, BLASTING THEIR HARMONIOUS SOUND ACROSS THE CAVERNS OF THAT AUDITORIUM WITH FINGERS AND LUNGS AND BRAINS WORKING FULL TILT THAT WE IN THE AUDIENCE WERE DRIVEN WILDER AND WILDER WITH EACH NEW SONG.  THE BAND WAS TIGHT, THE NIGHT FLOWED ON LIKE MERCURY, HEAVY THROUGH CHANNELS OF EXPANDING AWARENESS . . . WHERE GLENN CORNICK ROCKED IN A TWO STEP PATTERN THE ENTIRE NIGHT, BACK AND FORTH WITHOUT STOPPING, IN COMPLETE SYNC WITH OTHER MEMBERS WITH EVERY BEAT FROM HIS BASS GUITAR FOR EVERY SONG THAT NIGHT.  IT WAS CRAZY GOOD.  MESMERIZING.  AND NEW MEMBER JOHN EVAN ON KEYBOARDS SHOWED UP STRONG AS WELL, GIVING FULL ACCOMPANIMENT AND TICKLING THE OTHERS, MARTIN BARRE RIFFED BEAUTIFUL ON HIS GUITAR THE ENTIRE EVENING, TAKING THE SONGS APART AND THEN PUTTING THEM BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND CLIVE BUNKER HAMMERING THE PERFECT CONCEPTUAL BEAT OF THIS MASTERSTROKE ALBUM FOR AN EVENT THAT STILL PULSES THROUGHOUT THE COSMOS.  NOT LEAVING IAN ANDERSON TO STAND ALONE, HIS INSPIRED FLUID FLUTE PROVED THIS SHOW WOULD BE REMEMBERED FOR A LIFETIME, JUST AS HE CONTINUED TO WORK THE CROWD DURING EVERY TOUR OF THESE EARLY YEARS.  BUTTERFLIES IN A SUN-DAPPLED FOREST.  WONDROUS NOTES FLOATING ABOUT THE ROOM, ENCHANTING AS THEY SWEEP ALONG, CIRCULATING.    CORNICK WENT OUT ON HIS OWN AFTER THIS TOUR BUT LEFT HIS MARK ON JETHRO TULL FANS NEVERTHELESS.      I REMEMBER THE BAND STARTING THE SECOND SET AFTER A BRIEF INTERMISSION WITH \\"TO CRY YOU A SONG\\", PICKING UP EXACTLY WHERE THEY HAD LEFT OFF AND GLENN TUMBLING BACK AND FORTH WITH HIS BEAT BASS GUITAR, IAN WORKING THE MICROPHONE LIKE IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, THE WHOLE BAND LOVING US AS MUCH AS WE FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM.  NOT AN EASY TASK FOR ANY GROUP OF PEOPLE UNLESS ALL THE PIECES WERE IN PERFECT ALIGNMENT, THE GODS WERE SMILING BIG BUDDHA SMILES AND EVERYONE JOYFULLY POOLED INTO A SINGLE CONSCIOUSNESS FOR TWO STRAIGHT HOURS.  THAT WAS THIS CONCERT FOR THIS ALBUM.  AND THE MUSIC ON THIS DISK IS ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR ABILITIES ON STAGE AS AN ACT, AS A MUSICAL FORCE, AS BROTHERS BEARING GIFTS.  I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS COLLECTION OF SONGS.  TULL'S WORK HAS SHOWN US SOME AMAZING HEIGHTS THAT OTHERS MUST WORK HARD TO ACHIEVE, THEIR DEPTH AND DIVERSITY AND IN WEAVING OF INTRICATE PATTERNS AND DYNAMIC RHYTHMS.  SORTA LIKE A HEARTBEAT, WORKING HARD TO CLIMB THAT MOUNTAIN AND THEN REST FOR A MOMENT, ONLY TO FORGE AHEAD AGAIN TOWARD THE NEXT MAGNIFICENT SUMMIT.  PERSONAL AND WELCOMING IN ITS DIFFICULTY.  REALLY COOL AND GREASY.
0316017922|5.0|Enjoyed Malcolm way of presenting his perspective. Storytelling is the best way to define the way you'll get the notions and principles of success presented in this book.<br />The approach was based on several studies, to simplify their conclusions and present it as a very lean and enjoyable reading.<br />It gives a great understanding on how things happen to some successful people and not to others.
0316010669|5.0|It's worth, fun and an optimistic reading, because it gives a new perspective from our daily decision-making and based in several studies from other authors.<br /><br />Simplifies human decision understanding, with clear examples and stories.
B002BFBAUG|5.0|In 2009,  writer and director Greg Mottola's (\\"Superbad\\", \\"Arrested Development\\" and \\"Undeclared\\") film \\"Adventureland\\" was released in theaters and for the most part, received positive reviews from the film critics.  Now the film receives its High Definition treatment via Blu-ray (which includes a digital copy) and also a DVD release.<br /><br />The film takes place in the 80's and revolves around James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg, \\"The Village\\" and \\"Solitary Man\\"), a Comparative Literature major who graduated from Oberlin College and plans to pursue his undergraduate degree at Columbia University but first, celebrate his graduation by taking advantage of his family's gift to send him to Europe over the summer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his father (Jack Gilpin, \\"21', \\"Law & Order\\") was moved to a new department which pays less money than his previous job and thus his mother (Wendie Malick, \\"Just Shoot Me!\\", \\"Fillmore\\", \\"Frasier\\"),  break the news to him that the money saved for the trip is now gone, nor can they pay for his college.<br /><br />So, now James must save up money for his trip to Europe by looking for a job.  Unfortunately, finding a job has been too difficult and leaves him with his last resort, working at the local summer theme park known as \\"Adventureland\\" and is under the constant eye of his boss Bobby (Bill Hader, \\"Saturday Night Live\\", \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\") and his wife Paulette (Kristin Wiig, \\"Saturday Night Live\\", \\"Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story\\").<br /><br />James ends up working with Russian Literature major and all-round nerd Joel (Martin Starr, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\", \\"Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story\\", \\"Superbad\\" and \\"Knocked Up\\"); his former childhood best friend Tommy Frigo (Matt Bush, \\"Halloween II\\") who is now more of a jerk (and for some apparent reason, keeps hitting James in the nads); the technician and musician Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds, \\"The Proposal\\", \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\"); the Lou Reed fan Em Lewin (Kristen Stewart, \\"Twilight\\" films) and the sexy Lisa P (Margarita Levieva, \\"Spread\\" and \\"Vanished\\").<br /><br />While working at Adventureland, James begins a friendship with his co-workers and eventually gets invited to Em's party. While at the party, the two end up hitting it off and James becomes smitten with her, but he is unaware that Em and Mike Connell have some sort of relationship behind-the-scenes, despite Mike being a married man.<br /><br />And it's hard for anyone to look down on Mike Connel.  It appears that everyone at Adventureland looks up to Connell.  Especially with rumors that he played guitar with Lou Reed, let alone being popular with the women who think he is a rock star.  So, naturally for James (who has not had much experience with girls or dating), he starts to go to Connell for love advice.<br /><br />But through his summer job at Adventureland, James learns a lot about himself, about love but also the pain of being in love.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Adventureland\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and cinematographer Terry Stacey (\\"Sex and the City\\", \\"P.S. I Love You\\" and \\"Wanderlust\\" does a good job in bringing the look of the 1980's to film.  One thing that people will notice is the amount of grain on the film.  For those who love the film look, the film definitely retains its grain and shows no sign of DNR (Digital Noise Reduction).<br /><br />For the most part, the film is shot outdoors at a theme park and is shot primarily during the day, thus you get a good amount of color during those sunny days.  While night time shots are either at the amusement park, inside a car or inside a home.  For the most part, blacks are nice and deep and of course, there is shadowing but its typically due to the lighting of the amusement park.  But overall, \\"Adventureland\\" is a film that looks good and the grain definitely gives the film a sort of nostalgic look to it.<br /><br />As for the audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-Bit) and also French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue driven and music-based film.  Dialogue is clear and understandable through the front and center channels while popular 80's music is a big plus for this film and will definitely be appreciated for those who grew up during this time.  Although the film does not utilize major sound effects, there are scenes such as fireworks during July 4th that really sound nice and poppy through your front and surrounds.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Adventureland\\" comes with the following special features in 1080p or 480i, English 2.0 Dolby Digital, English SDH, French and Spanish:<br /><br />  *<br />  Deleted Scenes - (2:27) Deleted scenes featuring: Drunk Mom , Angry Grandfather, James Keeps Quiet.  With optional audio commentary by writer and director Greg Mottola<br />  *<br />  Audio Commentary - Writer/director Greg Mottola and actor Jesse Eisenberg talk about film. Mottola sets up the scene but for the most part the commentary often features the two joking around while doing commentary.  Interesting comments on the number of songs licensed for the film and the challenges Mottola faced when their budget was low but need a song for the ending credits.<br />  *<br />  Just My Life: The Making Of Adventureland - (16:31) Director and writer Greg Mottola sits down to reveal how his real life experiences helped inspire his unique comic vision for Daytrippers, Superbad, Arrested Development and now Adventureland. Cast members Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Ryan Reynolds, Bill Hader, and Martin Starr also talk candidly about what shaped them into who they are today, including the worst job they ever had.<br />  *<br />  Picture Music Selection - For those who enjoyed the 80's music from the film, you can view segments from the film featuring an artist or band's music.<br />  *<br />  Frigo's Ball Tap - (2:29) The \\"drive by,\\" the \\"ambush,\\" the \\"stranger,\\" the \\"tying of the shoe\\" and the knee-buckling, tear-inducing \\"Bangkok\\" are just a few of the nad numbing moves demonstrated by the testicle tapping guru himself, Matt Bush.<br />  *<br />  Lisa P's Guide To Style - (2:08) Ms. \\"Rides, Rides, Rides\\" herself, Lisa P (Margarita Levieva), shares her totally hip, totally `80s fashion advice from spiral locks to neon pink nail polish.<br />  *<br />  Welcome to Adventureland - Fans can learn all there is to know about the Adventureland theme park with a pair commercials promoting Fun-tastic Time at Adventure Land (:33 ) and another for fireworks at Adventureland (:42), the employee orientation kit (3:34) hosted by Joel and a peek at the official drug policy (:44).<br /><br />EASTER EGG: I also found an Easter Egg for the Blu-ray version.  Move left on your remote while \\"Bonus Features\\" is highlighted and you will see panda bear.  Click on the panda bear to access a Kristen Stewart trying to get into the Razzmatazz dance club. (1:24)<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />For those who are interested in \\"Adventureland\\", one may think that Director Mottola is back with another \\"SuperBad\\" style of movie but  I just want to emphasize that although \\"Adventureland\\" does have many humorous elements and the fact that there is a lot of scenes with the characters smoking weed, \\"Adventureland\\" is very much a love story.  Call it a genuine romantic comedy.<br /><br />What makes this film quite enjoyable is its colorful cast of characters and its wonderful music.  It can easily be called an 80's-style film, pot film (definitely not a hardcore stoner film) but the characters are what makes this film so enjoyable.  You can easily remember Tommy Frigo and his crazy nad hitting antics, Lisa P's sexy 80's dance moves, Joel trying to understand James and how he was able to become closer with Em and even Adventureland managers Bobby and Paulette who are just crazy in their own way.<br /><br />As for the main talent, Jesse Eisenberg was just perfect as James Brennan.  Eisenberg does a great job portraying the awkward Brennan and how he grows as a person throughout the summer.  Kristen Stewart also is a natural in playing the role of Em and bringing that sense that she's a troubled teen and showing us that she has more to offer outside of her popular role in \\"Twilight\\" (note: Stewart filmed \\"Adventureland\\" before filming \\"Twilight\\" but the latter came out in theaters first).<br /><br />As for Ryan Reynolds, his character as Mike Connell is a bit hard to read at first but you eventually see his true colors as the film progresses.  I sort of look at him as a man stuck within his former self of what he could have been but now thrives on being popular to those at the theme park and those people making him out better than he truly is.<br /><br />But for the most part, the characters seem real and genuine, thus making the film much more enjoyable.  As a romantic comedy, it's not the best but it's hard to deny the captivating storyline.  I really enjoyed watching this film!<br /><br />As for the music, \\"Adventureland\\" is a film that showcases popular 80's music such as Falco's \\"Amadeus\\", David Bowie's \\"Modern Love\\", The Cure's \\"Just Like Heaven\\", The Outfield's \\"Your Love\\", INXS's \\"Don't Change\\", Expose's \\"Point of No Return\\",  and many more.  So, it was great to see how music was utilized in the film, especially Falco's \\"Amadeus\\" (since most of us who grew up at that time know how this song was overplayed).<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, as mentioned, the Blu-ray comes with a digital copy of the film and the special features (which are unrated) are quite entertaining.  From \\"Frigo's Taps\\" and learning about various ways on how to hit someone in the nads was definitely unexpected.  Also, to see a featurette based on the character of Lisa P and showcasing her 80's fashion style was quite interesting.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed \\"Adventureland\\" for being an enjoyable romantic comedy.  A pretty entertaining storyline, intriguing and genuine characters and fabulous music made this film so enjoyable!<br /><br />For those looking for a fun, highly entertaining, young adult romantic comedy especially a film that showcases music from the 80's, definitely give \\"Adventureland\\" a try.d numbing moves demonstrated by the testicle tapping guru himself, Matt Bush.      *        Lisa P's Guide To Style - (2:08) Ms. \\"Rides, Rides, Rides\\" herself, Lisa P (Margarita Levieva), shares her totally hip, totally `80s fashion advice from spiral locks to neon pink nail polish.      *        Welcome to Adventureland - Fans can learn all there is to know about the Adventureland theme park with a pair commercials promoting Fun-tastic Time at Adventure Land (:33 ) and another for fireworks at Adventureland (:42), the employee orientation kit (3:34) hosted by Joel and a peek at the official drug policy (:44).

0312383320|2.0|Frankly, I didn't like it!  I found it the weakest and unfunniest of all the \\"Betweens\\" so far.  \\"Plum Lucky\\" is hilarious, and Doug is quite believeable.  But the Carl character in Spooky is just too far over the top, in my opinion and spoils the limited credibility of the rest of the story, which is itself a bit on the unbelieveable side.  2 Stars maximum, 1 minimum, so 1-1/2.
0545128285|4.0|During almost the entire length of [[ASIN:0545139708 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7) (Paperback)]], Hermione Granger carried with her an old book titled \\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" that was bequeathed to her by Professor Dumbledore in his will. It was not until much later that the full significance of the book, (particularly the final story) became clear in helping Harry achieve his quest of defeating Lord Voldemort.<br /><br />There have been little allusions to \\"wizard fairytales\\" throughout the series, namely through Ron who grew up with them and expressed disbelief that Harry and Hermione had never heard of the familiar stories:<br /><br />\\"You've never heard of the Tales of Beedle the Bard?\\" said Ron incredulously. \\"You're kidding right?\\"<br />\\"No, I'm not,\\" said Hermione in surprise. \\"Do you know them, then?\\"<br />\\"Well, of course I do! Oh, come on! All the old kid's stories are supposed to be Beedle's, aren't they? The Fountain of Fair Fortune...the Wizard and the Hopping Pot...Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump...\\"<br /><br />Perhaps initially starting as a fun way to add some depth to her sub-world and find a way to introduce the meaning and importance of the Deathly Hallows into the final book's plot, Rowling went on to actually write the complete collection of fairytales to share among her friends and to auction off as a collector's item for the Children's Voice charity campaign. Soon enough, it was made available to the general public.<br /><br />This is a fun little glimpse into the wizarding world, particularly when you keep in mind that these are the stories that wizarding children are brought up on, as familiar to them as Cinderella and Rapunzel are to Muggle children. Acting as an example of life imitating art (or art defictionalising art?) the reader gets the opportunity to delve a little deeper in the Potter-verse and get a taste of what it is that wizarding children are told at bedtimes.<br /><br />\\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\\" tells of a young wizard who inherits his father's cooking pot and his responsibility of caring for the Muggles in his village. Being of an intolerant sort, the wizard refuses to administer help to the villagers that come to him for aid, at which point the pot grows itself a foot and begins to teach him a lesson.<br /><br />In what is probably my favourite in the collection, \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune,\\" centers around a magical fountain said to grant one's heart's desire. Three witches and a Muggle knight face the challenges in the maze that surrounds it, only to come to a surprising truth when they reach the fountain itself.<br /><br />\\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart,\\" takes a darker turn, in which a warlock decides to avoid the pain of love by cutting out his own heart. When he bows to the social pressure to marry and beget children, he marries a young woman and reveals his secret to her. It doesn't end well for either of them. This is possibly the most interesting tale in the anthology. Since the warlock is dark, handsome and in dire need of saving, I couldn't help but feel that this tale stemmed from Rowling's vocal discomfort at the popularity of characters such as Draco and Lucius Malfoy and the deliberate misinterpretation of these characters as anything other than elitist, racist snakes.<br /><br />Tackling the idea of the prickly side of the relationship between Muggles and wizards, \\"Babbitty Rabbitty\\" tells of a king who tries to eliminate all the wizards and witches in his kingdom and his own attempts to learn magic. A charlatan comes forward in order to teach the king magic, but the old witch Babbitty Rabbitty has a few tricks of her own up her sleeve...<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers,\\" is the story told in \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\\" a haunting, thoughtful story of three brothers who meet Death on a bridge.

B000AMPZF8|5.0|From the haunting twinkle of synths which open Newborn to the shimmering swell of Megalomania, Origin of Symmetry is just gorgeous. Track 2, Bliss, has to be one of the most beautiful songs ever written. I could listen to it every day and never get tired of the swoon of emotion the vocals induce. Plug in Baby is amazing, the guitar is masterful! Hyper Music is complex, and twists and turns into something totally different than the begining of the song leads you to think. Feeling Good is blues-ey and shows the range of Matt Belamy's voice. Yes, yes, yes, BUY THIS!
B001P06GX4|5.0|We've seen this game in many of our favorite homeschooling catalogs and finally bought it - although we paid a bit more at the local toy store.  In the two weeks we've owned it, it's been a very popular toy, replacing Banagrams because it's easy for younger players to partipate, too.      The possibilities are endless and my children have yet to tire of the game.  The only negative I can see - and it's quite minor - is that the game board could use some sort of reinforcement in the back.  I can see an excited little one (like my young son) placing his hand right in the middle and denting or cracking it.      Highly recommended.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I discovered Muse when they opened for My Chemical Romance in Nashville in April 2007. I was expecting the usual opening band crapfest, and instead got MUSE! How blessed am I? The music was just perfect, and I went right out and got Black Holes and Revelations and Absolution. Initially, I liked BHaR the better of the two, but Time is Running Out just stuck in my brain. Then Sing for Absolution became my favorite song. Then it was Small Print. Then Stockholm Syndrome. Then, forget it, Absolution is my favorite Muse album. Each song is too great for words to do it justice. The lyrics on the album are some of the most lush and romantic ever sang. Honestly, this is one of the best. Just get it and listen for yourself. Just TRY to get Time is Running Out out of your brain! I dare you!
0061122416|5.0|This is a quick read and made me thing about the choices I make. Best book I've read since Siddhartha!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Take a Bow is epic, it is like watching a star being born. The lyrics are still timely, which is distressing when you realize it came out several years ago. I love how the song builds and unfolds on itself. Starlight is driven and sonic, a beautiful song with a powerful beat and strong piano. Supermassive Black Hole is sexy. I don't care what anyone has to say about it being cheesey or whatever. It is a very sexy song, the layers of bass line are fantastic, and Matt's vocals are as fluid as ever. Map of the Problematique is like a classic Muse song, it would easily fit on Absolution. Soldier's Poem is just heartbreaking in it's truth. Yes, 'it is a shame we're all dying. How could you send us so far away from home? There is no justice in the world, and there never was'. Amen, Matt. Assassin is throbbing and pounding, with kick butt guitar, with a message of revolution. Knights of Cydonia is my favorite. It just builds and builds to guitar god heaven. I simply can't listen to it though without thinking of the video with the galloping horse and the space cowboys! I can barely contain myself until September 15th, when we will have more MUSE at last!
B001HN697M|3.0|Fairly entertaining except Michael Sheen is too contemporary for the role of Lucien and with all the beautiful vampire women running around manages to fall for the ugliest in the bunch!
B00001SIES|5.0|In the beginning was Showbiz, and although production quality is not up to later efforts, this is an awesome start. Hate This and I'll Love you is my favorite, from it's summer night cricket sounds to the unraveling passion of the piano and guitar to Matt's intense vocals, a perfect piece of music. I feel it down to my toes. The minor key shift toward the end is enough to induce an out of body experience. The end is the balance of the parts. Yes, I think it is that good. Unintended is simple, and profound. Who hasn't felt those emotions? The simplicity gives way to the lusciousness of the chorus, and it's near Classical music perfection. Showbiz is the song I kept listening to, not quite sure how I felt about it until I got the restraint of the music with \\"Controlling my feelings for too long\\". It is like a build up of all the anger and resentment you've ever felt after someone has ripped your heart out, \\"Trying to please you for too long\\". \\"Forcing my darkest soul to unfold and pushing us into self-destruction\\". Cave is sort of like Hyper Music,it is not the song you think it is, you have to really listen to it until the chorus. \\"Come in my cave...I'll burn your heart away\\". Please. Killer guitar riff. Fillip is like a reflection on the flip side of Plug in Baby, until the arc in the center - 'Trust me, I never knew that you were the one'. This is what makes Fillip a great rock song. Uno is so different from anything I have ever heard before, the guitar is just shattering perfection. Above all, Matt Belamy has a powerful voice. This is a must have.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|While Silent Hill isn't my favorite horror movie, I love the concept and it's good enough to watch again once in a while.    It looks like a sequel is slated to come out in 2010, which is good, because I think it's ripe for more stories on this theme, much like with the video game.
B0014G5LG2|1.0|Considering the rave reviews by other listeners, I was surprised to agree with Eric Gross' view that this performance is boring. I have numerous recordings of Mahler's 10th and the ones that stand out for repeated listening from me are Barsahi, Chailly and Gielen. This new recording by Daniel Harding failed to hold my attention -- which is rare in Mahler. I don't understand what the fuss is all about with this conductor. Now that I recall, I felt the same way about his recordings of Don Giovanni (simply awful) and Brahms' 3rd and 4th symphonies (also boring).
B000QCTNIW|5.0|I have waited until I finished this book before commenting.  Those who have resigned themselves to thinking nothing can be done when a part of a loved one's brain is damaged and has been deemed incurable can restore their hope for a better outcome.      This book is written well and can be enjoyed by those without a medical degree or background.  Approximately 66% through the Kindle Edition, discussions of the sources of material and other comments on each chapter are made and  complete the book.  At first, I thought these were just repetitive reading; not true.  More recent developments and newer instances are included.

B002BIULQ2|5.0|Forget about all the other movies out in the theaters or the market. Hannah Montana is the best movie ever. Why? Because this movie is more reality and less glamourous hollywood. Miley Cyrus in my opinion is the best in the world at what she does, this movie proves it. The acting was real, the story was real, and it makes you wish that Hannah Montana will never, ever go away. Along with the 5 star acting you will also get to enjoy the music of Hannah Montana, and the inspirational and awesome ballad that is \\"The Climb\\". Everybody in the world, I don't care if you're black or white, have two or four legs, or no legs, poor or rich, young or old, human, animal, or alien, buy this movie. You won't regret it, as it is the best movie of 2009, and possibly forever. BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|It is a very hard workout.  Depending how much hand weight do you use it will be the intensity... but, if you want result you have to push yourself. I been doing P90X for over a yr now and this workout DO NOT compare with P90X, ever.  The main reason is because you don't rest and as she said you keep your heart rate very high, plus is only 20min.  I wish that she could recomend how much weight should we use.  I been using 5pound,I think it is a lot, but I want to feel the workout, so I will not go down in weight and push myself. I usually burn 240 calories in those 20min and my heart rate goes higher than 170!   100% recommended!!
B002IPXSTA|5.0|I love this album. I was a huge fan of The Format...and then a huge fan of Steel Train when I saw them open for The Format. The fact that Jack and Nate are in FUN together adds even more excitement. Also I think Andrew fits in with them perfectly. I am so glad they decided to form this band. It seemed like it took forever for the album to come out but it is as \\"fun\\" and amazing as I had hope it would be. You'll love it!
0143035711|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read on the Vietnam War. It is as good as Michael Herr's \\"Despatches\\" or \\"The Ten-thousand Day War\\". Pilot Mason made me feel as if I was actually there through his vivid and complete descriptions; from the start of training, through to combat and on to the consequences of his experiences. The tension of formation landing in a 'hot' LZ must have been a white-knuckle ride. The author gives clear insights into the different demeanours of the pilots through the descriptions of their actions in war, from self-less heroism through to having to ask myself what sort of person kills wild elephants from a helicopter with rockets? The author also allows us to view the wartime lives of 'the Grunts', Crew Chiefs, Door Gunners etc. His descriptions also made me realize one would have been fighting the natural environment of Vietnam such as the heat, the mossquitos, the rats etc. as much as the enemy. The descriptions of flying combat missions non-stop for 24 hrs are a real insight to the demands of war. It is not all doom & gloom though, with the descriptions of Ringknocker's more 'flexible' approach to command. Realistic, straightforward, clear, unambiguous and easy to read. Author Robert Mason puts you in the Huey's second seat at the controls with him. \\"You got it\\".

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This nice covered booklet 4CD/1DVD collection is truly the Ultimate Collection.  This is a must have collection of Michael Jackson (MJ).    I did not expected to get such a nice presented cover, booklet, CD's and DVD.  I'm very proud that I did ordered this Ultimate Collection CD/DVD.  Since I got mine MJ Ultimate Collection I'm playing it over and over and over again.    It coveres all of MJ's songs (e.g Ben, Rock with you, Don't stop till you get enough, Triller, Bad) and it also includes some unrealesed songs and the best part is the DVD with MJ's best tour ever: The Dangerous Tour in Bucharest.    If you consinder yourself a MJ fan you should not miss this great Micheal Jackson \\"The Ultimate Collection\\".
B000NU2CY4|1.0|The picture quality for this one is very poor. It´s a total mess. Universal just did an upscale of the DVD transfer creating artifacts, noise and blur over the picture. I really don´t know what they´re thinking with this one. This movie should have a re-release with a proper picture quality.     Besides that, the movie deserves a better sound mix like the first DVD release.     Shame on you Universal :(
1400156890|5.0|This is the story of the Dashwood sisters: the logical Elinor (sense) and the emotional Marianne (sensibility). I actually listened to this novel on audio, and the narrator was so good it was difficult to stop listening to get anything else done.  Austen draws us into the world of Regency England, where women are looking for husbands, preferably rich ones, and men are looking for beauty, preferably accompanied by fortune. But there's more to this story than that. I found myself occasionally laughing aloud as the narrator read; some things that were amusing in 1811 actually still are. Jane Austen pokes fun at her characters, and many of their foibles are recognizable as things we would mock today. One example is the description of  conceited young gentleman (many of the ladies refer to him as a \\"cockscomb\\") who is seen in a jewelry story arguing with a clerk over the kind of jewel-encrusted toothpick holder he needs to purchase.  This is unquestionably one of the best books I've ever read; I highly recommend the audio narrated by Wanda McCaddon, who also uses the names Nadia May and Donada Peters.
B000JBWWQ0|2.0|The book was awesome and kept me interested and intrigued to the end. There was not enough time in the movie to create the depth that was present in the book. Thus it was a superficial experiencial recap of the book instead of what could have been a great insightfull movie. I would reread the book before rewatching the movie.  So Sad.
0307454541|5.0|After a slow start (I could not get interested in the first 70 pages), this novel finally takes off and doesn't let up until the final page. It is a complex and richly detailed story involving a powerful family with plenty of skeletons in the closet. The family tree chart at the beginning of the book is very helpful but you might also want to take notes to keep the characters in order. This is a great book for readers who like complex mysteries with detailed analysis of tracking down clues and characters who are compelling and flawed. The mystery kept me guessing until the end and I can't wait to read the follow-up.
1567184855|3.0|This is a believable account of a souls experiences between lives. There are 25 case histories recorded by Hypnotherapist  Michael Newton.  The accounts have a somewhat similar thread running through them, giving a sense of truth to the reader.   However I would have liked more discriptions of the environment  and the different activities experienced by the soul, surely thirty or forty years which is apparently spent between lives is not totally taken up with examining the last life and planning for the next one.  Just a mild criticism , otherwise I enjoyed the book very much.
0618918248|1.0|Atheism is a subject that I haven't spent a lot of time researching until lately.  This is due to the fact that Atheism has been fairly rare in my neck of the woods (\\"The Bible Belt\\") until the so-called \\"New Atheism\\" books became national best sellers.  Because Atheism never appealed to me as a rational account for reality, I never really saw the need to investigate further.  But as soon as my friends abandoned their faith in God and the Bible, I felt it necessary to find out why.  Lo and behold, many of them did so because of books like \\"The God Delusion.\\"  And because I care about my friends, and want to be equipped to \\"give an answer\\" for my beliefs (1 Peter 3:15), I felt obliged to not only be familiar with atheistic reasoning, but to see if it can account for reality.  \\"The God Delusion\\" was atheism's first attempt at this.<br /><br />In this book, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, spends 10 chapters convincing his readers that \\"The God Hypothesis\\" not only has poor explanatory power, but hinders our rational, scientific, and moral minds.  Though the author is a gifted writer, I was most disappointed that there was virtually no argument for atheism for the first 75 pages.  In light of this, one sentence in the first chapter really got \\"The God Delusion\\" off on a bad start for me:<br /><br />\\"It is possible that religious readers will be offended by what I have to say, and will find in these pages insufficient respect for their own particular beliefs (if not the beliefs that others treasure).  It would be a shame if such offense prevented them from reading on, so I want to sort it out here, at the outset.\\" (p. 20)<br /><br />In other words, Richard Dawkins was about to get offensive.  Now, I'm all about being up front with your beliefs, and even stepping on the toes of those who disagree with you.  But one thing I strongly despise is disrespect.  And for one who provides not one argument for atheism in the first 75 pages, disrespect and offense is not very appealing to a reader such as myself.  Fortunately, I'm not closed-minded, so I kept reading in accordance with Dawkins' plea.<br /><br />Nothing in the first chapter really rubbed me the wrong way.  Some of the points that Dawkins developed was the \\"religious\\" nature of the atheist and used Einstein as an example.  Dawkins sought to dispel the commonly held myth that he believed in God, as if the theists could claim him as one of their own.  In doing so, Dawkins could justify his own \\"religious\\" nature, yet be fully atheistic in the process.  Perhaps the following quote illustrates:<br /><br />\\"If by `God' one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God.  This God is emotionally unsatisfying...it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.\\" (p. 19, where Dawkins quotes Carl Sagan)<br /><br />The last point in the chapter deals with some things that I have long realized; the political correctness in \\"respecting\\" Muslims and other easily offended religious groups.  Without getting nit-picky with Dawkins, I found myself agreeing with much of what he said, and he rightly pointed out the many double standards involved in so-called \\"political correctness.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 2, \\"The God Hypothesis,\\" didn't get off to a good start in the following being the first sentence:<br /><br />\\"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.\\"<br /><br />This isn't to say that Dawkins doesn't have the write to say what he wants about YHWH, but this certainly sets the tone for the bias that is prevalent throughout the book.  However, I think the downfall is Dawkins' hope of converting as many people as possible to atheism.  Andunfortunately, for Dawkins, he isn't going to get a lot of converts from people like myself; those who have actually done a little bit of research in the area of theistic evidences.  Instead, Dawkins' target audience seems to be those who are in a \\"confused\\" state; perhaps they've grown up religious, but were never taught to question anything.  Whatever the case, Dawkins' bluntness doesn't give him any more credibility in converting the honest researcher who isn't after emotional appeals.<br /><br />While there is much to mention with regards to Chapter 2, I wanted to use this review to address some of the arguments Dawkins presents for his atheism.  In Chapter 3, the author seeks to refute some of the long-held \\"proofs\\" for God's existence.  Honestly, I was expecting much more from Dawkins.  Never did I see any evidence that Dawkins has spent any time researching the modern, refined evidences for God.  Instead, he refers back to the thirteenth century Thomas Aquinas, as if this was the best that theism had to offer.  The reason this bothered me is because if Dawkins really wanted to convince his readers that there is no God, then why not appeal to the best that the other side has to say?  Apparently, high standards don't apply to Dawkins.<br /><br />First, the author \\"deals\\" with a few variations of the Cosmological Argument.  In my opinion, Dawkins attempt was elementary.  Had Dawkins bothered to read anything by modern theistic philosophers, he would be aware that Aquinas' arguments have actually undergone some significant development since the thirteenth century.  It would be like me writing a refutation of evolution today but referencing Origin of Species and leaving out the plethora of evolutionary literature that has been written since.  Surely, Dawkins would be appalled, and rightly so.  He would hold me to the highest standard in dealing with the best that the other side has to say.  Unfortunately, Dawkins didn't think too much about double-standards when writing his book.<br /><br />It is quite insulting to see how little Dawkins actually devoted to the Cosmological Argument. From what I could count, only four paragraphs were devoted.  In \\"refuting\\" the argument, Dawkins appeals to the constant drumbeat of the theist's \\"assumption that God himself is immune to the regress.\\" (p. 77) This is repeated throughout in dealing with the various theistic arguments.  However, if Dawkins had bothered to read, for instance, William Craig's treatise of the Kalam Cosmological Argument, he would have been aware that the regress doesn't apply to God, as it only applies to things which have a beginning:<br /><br />I. Everything that had a beginning, had a cause.<br />II. The Universe had a beginning<br />III. Therefore, the Universe had a cause.<br /><br />If there is a problem with an \\"infinite regress\\" for an eternal being, I submit that Dawkins has a much bigger problem in postulating that everything came from nothing.  But to my knowledge, Dawkins did not deal with his own problems in atheism.  Perhaps Dawkins doesn't see it as a problem that, given his view, things can spring into existence from nothing!  Would Dawkins' not agree that from nothing, nothing comes?  Apparently not, because for him, from nothing everything came!<br /><br />For this reason, I have no reason to conclude otherwise that Dawkins is a poor philosopher as well as a poor researcher.  Perhaps Dawkins is a great biological researcher?  But the author has shown absolutely not evidence of being able to apply the same standards to his field to that of other fields to which he has no expertise.<br /><br />There is almost no use in dealing with the other 4 \\"theistic proofs\\" as they are just as poorly dealt with.  Perhaps one of the most insulting is his dealings with the Ontological Argument.  Anyone who has taken a look at the philosophical arguments put forth with regards to this controversial issue would be appalled at how unfamiliar the author is with the arguments.  In fact, if Dawkins had written this section as a philosophy paper in an introductory course, he would have failed.  Whether you find the Ontological Argument to be good or not, atheist or theist, you can't help but cringe at how this man passes for an intellectual.  And I don't mean this to be insulting.  Dawkins has truly failed in fairly dealing with these theistic arguments.<br /><br />One theistic evidence that was missing from \\"The God Delusion\\" was the Transcendental Argument for God's Existence, commonly referred to as TAG.  But after reading Dawkins' poor treatise of the arguments, I'm actually glad that he didn't try to tackle it.  I can't imagine how poorly he would misrepresent it.  But again, I don't think Dawkins gives a rip about representing one's views fairly and could care less in targeting people like me as his audience.  Instead, Dawkins is after the theists who never bothered, or will ever bother, to read the scholarly, source material for these arguments.<br /><br />Chapter 4 is interestingly titled, \\"Why There Almost Certainly is No God.\\"  However, don't be fooled: the author is showing no evidence of an open mind.  This chapter is basically dealing with the design argument.  Dawkins' refutation basically boils down to, \\"who designed the designer?\\" as if theists didn't think this would be a potential objection.  But never mind that.  Dawkins doesn't expect his readers to read theistic works for themselves, for if they did, they'd see how elementary his arguments really are.<br /><br />I found it very interesting that of all works which could be referenced, \\"Life--how did it Get Here?\\" (Published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society) was referenced.  Dawkins is absolutely right that this is a popular work with eleven million published copies.  But what Dawkins forgets to mention is that the vast majority of these books are owned by Jehovah's Witnesses themselves.  Furthermore, a snowball in a blast furnace has a better chance than a Jehovah's Witness actually taking the time to evaluate the arguments presented in \\"The God Delusion.\\"  But never mind that.  Dawkins isn't concerned with presenting the best that the other side has to offer.  Instead, he refers to one of the most closed-minded religions in the world in presenting arguments against evolution.  After all, why appeal to the hundreds of books and articles that have been written by Ph.D scientists in refuting evolution when you could refer to a book published by the Watchtower?<br /><br />To be fair, Dawkins does reference Michael Behe in his dealings with irreducible complexity.  But, as stated before, the author's attempt to refute is pathetic.  \\"Without a word of justification, explanation or amplification, Behe simply proclaims the bacterial flagellar motor to be irreducibly complex.\\" (p. 131) Rather than go into the complex arguments involved with the bacterial flagellum, I ask that you read Darwin's Black Box for yourself and see if Behe argues his point \\"without a word of justification.\\"  Those who do so will find Dawkins' statement to be utterly dishonest, even if one disagrees with Behe.<br /><br />In attempting to deal with the flagellar motor, Dawkins borrows Miller's argument in appealing to the TTSS pump as evidence that the motor could function as something else before actually becoming a motor.  Thus, the author concludes, \\"evidently, crucial components of the flagellar motor were already in place and working before the flagellar motor involved.\\" (p. 132) I ask that the reader look at the responses offered by Behe and others to see if Dawkins actually dealt with the arguments fairly, as the issues would be too complex to discuss in this book review.<br /><br />Dawkins then deals with some of the other theistic proofs, such as the \\"fine-tuning\\" argument, but falls into the same trap of not bothering to look at the counter-refutations or modern developments.  Instead, the author presents the same tired argument of,<br /><br />\\"A God capable of calculating the Goldilocks values for the six numbers would have to be at least as improbable as the finely tuned combination of numbers itself.\\" (p. 143)<br /><br />However, Dawkins completely misses the boat with his objection, which actually doesn't explain anything.  This is in light of his example of the man who is sentenced to death by a firing squad, but they all miss.  In reacting, the man exclaims, \\"Well, obviously they all missed, or I wouldn't be here thinking about it.\\" (p. 144) This is a classic case of circular reasoning.<br /><br />I. The universe is set up with specific parameters.<br />II. Life is here.<br />III. Therefore, it happened by chance.  Otherwise we wouldn't be here.<br /><br />The problem with Dawkins is that he neglects the specified and purposeful tuning of the universe.  Its not just the mere fact that its improbable.  After all, the structures to which a bucket of toothpicks forms after being dumped on the floor is extremely improbable.  But finding toothpicks arranged on the floor to read the first page in \\"The God Delusion\\" would not just merely be an improbable event, as if it happened by chance.  Instead, it would display specification, function, and purpose.  This is the lens to which we view all things that are functionally and purposefully specified.  But when it comes to the natural world, we have to advocate unproven and unnecessary \\"multiverse theories.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 5 deals with the roots of religion; where it comes from and why we have it.  Certainly, I have my disagreements with Dawkins on this issue.  However, the issue doesn't really matter if, in fact, Christianity is true.  That is, you can speculate all you want to and come up with innumerable convincing theories.  But if something is actually true, then it doesn't really matter to me how you think it might have originated.  And this is a big problem I have with Dawkins' book; there is far more content that assumes the case is closed than actual arguments against theistic proofs.  The number of pages devoted to Dawkins' opinions on religions is far too numerous in comparison to the shallow level to which he has dealt with the theistic arguments.<br /><br />I was very disappointed with chapter 6, where Dawkins attempts to answer the question, \\"why be good?\\"  And the reason I was disappointed is because the question is not, \\"why be good?\\"  Instead, the question should be, \\"if there is no God, then what is the basis for good and evil?\\"  In other words, you can come up with all the evolutionary explanations you want to as to \\"why\\" we should be \\"good.\\"  But the problem is, what if your \\"good\\" is not the same as my \\"good?\\"  The \\"why\\" becomes completely irrelevant.<br /><br />Chapter 7 is an attempt to disprove the Bible as any sort of \\"good book.\\"  But the argument assumes too much; namely, that Dawkins has an objective basis for judging the Bible.  Even if the Bible were the most cruel and sadistic book in existence; if it is true, then its morality is true.  Dawkins fails to realize this and simply argues on the basis that he is the objective beholder of true morality.  But what he forgets is if atheism is true, then morality is up for grabs.  In other words, what's wrong for you might be right for me.  Later in the chapter, Dawkins sought to list his \\"10 commandments,\\" as if they were somehow authoritative and binding upon all men.  Sure, you might find a lot of people who think that its moral to obey, \\"in all things strive to cause no harm (Commandment #2).\\"  But if you talk to the countless thousands who are in prisons worldwide for causing unjustified harm to others, they might just be there because they disagreed with the \\"second commandment.\\"  So here, Dawkins assumes what he is trying to prove; that these \\"commandments\\" are somehow the yardstick of morality.<br /><br />Chapters 8 and 9 could probably be lumped together, as they are the epitome of Dawkins' hostility towards religion.  In fact, the title of chapter 8 is, \\"What's wrong with religion? Why be so hostile?\\"  Most of the arguments Dawkins makes are primarily based on \\"religion's\\" moral ills.  Thus, because \\"religion\\" does things to hurt people and disobeys Dawkins' \\"ten commandments,\\" he sees fit to be hostile.  And with moral objectivity aside, I don't blame Dawkins for his hostility.  In other words, Dawkins thinks that his morality is right, and so he acts accordingly.  I do the same thing, since I believe that my morality is right.  But what is Dawkins really arguing here?  Everything that is \\"so wrong with religion\\" is only wrong because the neurons firing in his brain causes him to think that it is wrong.  This says nothing about moral objectivity.  Its all assumption, and does nothing for someone like me who believes that God, not Richard Dawkins, is the beholder of morality.<br /><br />Overall, I was very disappointed with \\"The God Delusion.\\"  Had Dawkins spent more time in actual argument than expressing his hostility, I might have provided a better review.  But it wasn't Dawkins' objective to actually convince people like me; those who are familiar with the arguments and are willing to look stuff up.  Instead, Dawkins is targeting people who are on the edge of doubt; those who aren't going to look up the facts or counter-refutations by theistic apologists.  And sadly, these people are embracing Dawkins' brand of radical atheism.<br /><br />The only way this book can be at all profitable is to be familiar with the so-called \\"new atheists\\" and how they might present their arguments.  However, in my opinion, your time would be much more well spent in reading arguments by the more sophisticated, less-hostile atheists who actually engage the best arguments from the other side.  \\"The God Delusion\\" is a complete waste of paper and would have much better use in a recycling bin.<br /><br />*All page numbers are from the hardcover 2006 edition.a Jehovah's Witness actually taking the time to evaluate the arguments presented in \\"The God Delusion.\\"  But never mind that.  Dawkins isn't concerned with presenting the best that the other side has to offer.  Instead, he refers to one of the most closed-minded religions in the world in presenting arguments against evolution.  After all, why appeal to the hundreds of books and articles that have been written by Ph.D scientists in refuting evolution when you could refer to a book published by the Watchtower?<br /><br />To be fair, Dawkins does reference Michael Behe in his dealings with irreducible complexity.  But, as stated before, the author's attempt to refute is pathetic.  \\"Without a word of justification, explanation or amplification, Behe simply proclaims the bacterial flagellar motor to be irreducibly complex.\\" (p. 131) Rather than go into the complex arguments involved with the bacterial flagellum, I ask that you read Darwin's Black Box for yourself and see if Behe argues his point \\"without a word of justification.\\"  Those who do so will find Dawkins' statement to be utterly dishonest, even if one disagrees with Behe.<br /><br />In attempting to deal with the flagellar motor, Dawkins borrows Miller's argument in appealing to the TTSS pump as evidence that the motor could function as something else before actually becoming a motor.  Thus, the author concludes, \\"evidently, crucial components of the flagellar motor were already in place and working before the flagellar motor involved.\\" (p. 132) I ask that the reader look at the responses offered by Behe and others to see if Dawkins actually dealt with the arguments fairly, as the issues would be too complex to discuss in this book review.<br /><br />Dawkins then deals with some of the other theistic proofs, such as the \\"fine-tuning\\" argument, but falls into the same trap of not bothering to look at the counter-refutations or modern developments.  Instead, the author presents the same tired argument of,<br /><br />\\"A God capable of calculating the Goldilocks values for the six numbers would have to be at least as improbable as the finely tuned combination of numbers itself.\\" (p. 143)<br /><br />However, Dawkins completely misses the boat with his objection, which actually doesn't explain anything.  This is in light of his example of the man who is sentenced to death by a firing squad, but they all miss.  In reacting, the man exclaims, \\"Well, obviously they all missed, or I wouldn't be here thinking about it.\\" (p. 144) This is a classic case of circular reasoning.<br /><br />I. The universe is set up with specific parameters.<br />II. Life is here.<br />III. Therefore, it happened by chance.  Otherwise we wouldn't be here.<br /><br />The problem with Dawkins is that he neglects the specified and purposeful tuning of the universe.  Its not just the mere fact that its improbable.  After all, the structures to which a bucket of toothpicks forms after being dumped on the floor is extremely improbable.  But finding toothpicks arranged on the floor to read the first page in \\"The God Delusion\\" would not just merely be an improbable event, as if it happened by chance.  Instead, it would display specification, function, and purpose.  This is the lens to which we view all things that are functionally and purposefully specified.  But when it comes to the natural world, we have to advocate unproven and unnecessary \\"multiverse theories.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 5 deals with the roots of religion; where it comes from and why we have it.  Certainly, I have my disagreements with Dawkins on this issue.  However, the issue doesn't really matter if, in fact, Christianity is true.  That is, you can speculate all you want to and come up with innumerable convincing theories.  But if something is actually true, then it doesn't really matter to me how you think it might have originated.  And this is a big problem I have with Dawkins' book; there is far more content that assumes the case is closed than actual arguments against theistic proofs.

B000005HAU|5.0|For dedicated listeners of jazz guitar, Bir&eacute;li Lagr&eacute;ne's \\"Standards\\" is one of the most remarkable recordings to listen to and enjoy. For those who have not heard of him, this is an ideal introduction to his Django Reinhardt-inspired-artistry. The album, which was originally released in 1993 under Blue Note Records, has a varied and balanced material--a mix of classic standards and a few originals from jazz legends Charlie Parker and Django Reinhardt, and bossa nova icon Antonio Carlos Jobim.<br /><br />The multi-instrumentalist (bass, violin, guitar) was born in France and came from a family of musicians, his father being a guitarist too. His many notable live performances include \\"Cully Jazz Festival\\" in Switzerland and \\"Live at the Carnegie Hall\\" and not to mention regular gigs at Iridium Jazz Club and Lincoln Center in New York City.<br /><br />Bir&eacute;li Lagr&eacute;ne's rhythmic guitar that sounds so crisp brings to mind the splendor of Paris jazz scene in Henri Betti's effervescent \\"C'est Si Bon\\" and Django Reinhardt's lyrical \\"Nuages.\\" It also evokes the spirit of Brazil in Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"How Insensitive.\\"<br /><br />His striking takes on a set of standards such as \\"Days of Wine And Roses,\\" \\"Teach Me Tonight\\" and \\"Body And Soul\\" are testaments of what he can do with his favorite instrument--a Stefan Hahl custom-design-signature-guitar. For someone who started playing guitar at age four and recorded his first album at age 13, he can deliver jazz-oriented tunes with clearly-defined and straight-ahead chording that makes them so appealing even to the most discriminating ears.<br /><br />But the real magic of the program is the melodic lines of an achingly beautiful tune, \\"Smile,\\" where the masterful guitarist's inherent skill is at its very best. His interpretation is almost like a serenade that he's playing for you and you alone, making sure that each note is executed as exquisitely as possible. (I would have given the album a four-star-rating, but because of the charms of this track alone, I added one more star).<br /><br />Give it your welcoming ears and immerse yourself in the world of inspired jazz music courtesy of a fine guitarist with the backing of two equally talented sidemen: drummer Andr&eacute; Ceccarelli and bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen who has worked with Oscar Peterson on some of his great recordings.<br /><br />Is Bir&eacute;li Lagr&egrave;ne a Django Reinhardt reincarnated? I would invite all music lovers who appreciate jazz guitar to listen and judge for yourselves.<br /><br />Wholeheartedly recommended.lone, I added one more star).

B000GW8RX4|5.0|I have a pretty extensive collection of concert dvds but this one is definitely my favorite. Unfortunately, no \\"Stargazer\\" and some of the songs drag on a little longer than they should (the rather unfocused version of \\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\" comes to mind, in particular). But with that said, this is a definite must see for any rock music fan. This is the only full concert available on dvd with the Blakmore/Dio/Powell lineup and they sound spectacular.  Buy it...you won't be disappointed.
0385737947|3.0|I found the plotline very entertaining. It seemed to combine aspects of Ender's Game with Lord of the Flies, particularly at the end. I appreciated that the overall age level of the group was made older than either of the characters in its predecessors. I thought it more plausible that teenagers would try to function as adults than pre-teens or younger, so yay for that. I found the cross between \\"lab rat maze\\" and \\"minotuar's labyrinth\\" (complete with monsters and pitfalls) a decent narrative trope for how these young people got stuck in the first place.    For the most part the focus on the Gladers' preoccupation with getting out and staying in one piece made sense. A mouse hunting for cheese in a maze quite frankly doesn't care about the why or wherefores it is in the maze to start with. I did find the lost memories to be an interesting variable. I also thought that it was used in an interesting way to create tension and drama between characters particularly the division between those who had partially regained pre-maze memories and those who had not. I just wish there had been a touch more of it.    I do have a few criticisms to levy. I wish there had been a little more description about the characters' mental states and more around their interactions and reactions to each other. They were all right as they are, but I would have liked two iotas more depth to them.     Another thing was the descriptions of the place in general, particularly descriptions centering on the grievers. The muddled image I had of those critters was something akin to a metallic version of the boar demons in Mononoke Hime, all tendrils and spikes emanating from a soft interior. Also, I felt that the scenes with the first night spent outside the glade should have been written with more suspense in mind. As it was, they read more like an action scene to me.    Also, I really hated the epilogue. I found that to be rather disappointing, mostly because of the sudden unwarranted shift away fromthe perspective of the Gladers, the lab rats. This made me grouchy.    I would quite happily recommend this book  and was left with the hope that the Maze Runner would replace the Lord of the Flies in school curriculum reading. It's certainly more entertaining.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|Having read multiple reviews on this website, the trend seems to be that people who read the book first hate this series. People who did not read the book, love the series. I am one who read the book before watching this dreadful series. Let me say that I have previosly enjoyed multiple HBO prductions. Being a native of Baltimore The Wire was fantastic and I watched the entire series in a few months. On this production (John Adams) I feel they failed miserably and it's a shame cause this truly is a great story. The acting is somewhat good and the production in itself is done fairly well. Paul Giamnti does his best to portray a difficult character. The actors playing Ben Franklin and George Washington do a nice job as well. The prize winner has to be Laura Linny. She gives a stellar performance as Abigail Adams. She's the one occurance where the book and series seem to agree. Where this seris goes wrong is how they tell the story. They miss so many key elements and I don't know how people who haven't previously read the book have any clue as to what's going on. When Adams went to France, do the viewers know it usually took up to a month to cross the Atlantic? The series makes it seem like an overnite trip. The book is very focused on the letters John and Abigail wrote back and forth while he was away. Only once do these letters get spoken of in the series. These are beautifly writtin letters and it's a shame the series brushed them aside to make room for made up drama. There are many maticulous errors in the series but I won't spend my time listing them. To me, the more galring problem is the choppiness of the series. If you watched this before reading the book, do yourself a favor and read the book. It's a better, much more accurate story.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I haven't read the Sookie Stackhouse novels yet so the characters and setting were all new to me. It took about two episodes and then I was hooked. I'm planning on reading the novels next. I really enjoyed all the subplots that were flowing through the series. Vampire rights, vampire groupies, serial killings, trade in vampire blood, vampire underworld and vampires wishing to mainstream in human society kept my interest and enjoyment of the show constant. The main characters both human and undead were all interesting. I really liked Bill Compton's portrayal of a 173 year old vampire trying to integrate into modern society. Tara was the other really well developed character with heaps of potential coming up. Two other characters worth watching have to be the shape shifting Sam and the Donald Trump of the kitchen Lafayette. Great production values, solid writing, terrific characters and interesting situations make this show a must see. By the way I love hearing the quiry southern accent, it makes the Aussie accent sound pretty ordinary in comparison. Can't wait for series two, it'll be a bloody beauty mate!

Their recent albums showed hints that they were still capable of bringing something fresh yet still sound like Maiden. However this album blows all the previous albums since \\"7 son of a 7 son\\" to shame. This album is fresh sounding is also cohesive it doesnt sound like they threw a bunch of songs together. These are some well thought out songs with good hooks and good vocals. Go buy this Album now...you will not be disapointed !!!! Up The Irons !!!
0765356139|3.0|Sanderson's development and refinement of the creatures within this world and the power's therein continues to impress, yet this 2nd installment has some serious flaws.<br /><br />Most of the book is truly trivial as it does little to significantly push forward the plot of \\"The Well of Ascension\\". It focused on the internal conflicts of two main characters, and dedicates itself to mostly \\"filler\\" action which allows time for certain other characters to conduct research into various secrets. I was able to skim through entire chapters without loosing the flow of the story and the gist of the plots within them.<br /><br />Its only in the last 1/5th of the book that the story pics up and \\"focuses\\". I didn't need most of the previous pages to get to that point.<br /><br />From this point on, spoilers.<br /><br />I found the \\"duels\\" between The Heir and The Watcher, a sideshow, though admittedly well written. The spy sidestory was brilliant, though fluffed.The constant internal insecurities of the two main characters are overdone. The reader doesn't need to see such insecurities every other page for 200 pages.

B00007GZQZ|5.0|I give this movie 8 Stars! To find a movie that brings joy, laughter, hope, enduring love and able to laugh at oneself and life and bring some reality to it is truly wonderful!! I laughed so much from beginning to end.  I found myself there with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long - working it together, even when apart for those few moments.  I shut out the world and allowed some laughter to reign inside my home while watching this movie. It was both real and quirky, but at the same time it gave me inspiration and my own hope that no matter how bad things may get, there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it is possible for love to endure amongst the chaos of the world.  It's part of my movie library along with other greats.
B002EWD08Q|5.0|Okay, so you put this cd in.  After your first play through of it, your immediate thoughts are, \\"Wow, the Arctic Monkeys have significantly put a darker edge on their music.\\"  This is true:  this cd is no where near their first two.  Half of the songs on here remind me of The Doors.  After multiple play throughs, this cd will grow on you substantially.  The Arctic Monkeys talent really shines through on this cd, showing they can play darker, more edgy songs and still get your mind hooked on them.  Matt Herold has amazing drumming like always through out all songs--preferably \\"My Propeller\\", \\"Crying Lightning\\", and \\"Pretty Visitors\\".  Do not hesitate to pick this cd up.  You may see sudden change at first, but I promise this cd will grow on you and show as much excellence as their other two.  It is fantastic!!

Except for a taste here and there, the action is confined to the final 50 or so pages, where Reacher too easily disposes of nearly two dozen baddies.  Most of the story involves Reacher and other characters finding another spot to have a cup of coffee and talk. And the Macguffin is never fully explained.  Here's hoping for a little more action and a little less Java next time.

B000A88FAO|5.0|Released just two years prior to George Orwell's fateful 1984, themes of surveillance and intrusion pervade the hit single [[ASIN:B001QYJG5O Eye In The Sky]].  But do those themes really extend into the rest of the album?  It would be a little difficult to make the argument that they do.  Because even Alan Parsons was not immune to the corrosive effects of an unenlightened, I daresay vacuous, music press of the time, he decided to steer his songwriting partner Eric Woolfson away from the conceptual approach both had taken with each of their previous releases.<br /><br />But what was sacrificed in the form of conceptual cohesion was more than compensated for with Woolfson's songcraft, Andrew Powell's orchestral arrangements, and a myriad of outstanding vocal performances.  Arguably the best example of all three coming together in a single song would be the album's closing epic [[ASIN:B001QYHH9Q Old And Wise]] which was inspired by the tragic news of a good friend's diagnosis of an incurable form of cancer.  Other standout tracks include [[ASIN:B001QYGEKO Sirius]], [[ASIN:B001QYEB3Q Children Of The Moon]], and [[ASIN:B001QYEB7M Psychobabble]], but my personal favorite has always been the introvert's anthem [[ASIN:B001QYGENQ Silence And I]] which has the distinction of having the single largest orchestral accompaniment, ninety pieces in all, that Andrew Powell ever composed for any Project song.<br /><br />While I do prefer the sonic performance, particularly the dynamic range, of this High Definition Audio Disc (HDAD) release by Classic Records, the more recent remaster of [[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]] has some of the most intriguing bonus material of all of The Project remasters.  Even if you are an audiophile of discriminating tastes and standards, I would still whole-heartedly recommend listening to bonus tracks from the recent SONY remaster, especially [[ASIN:B001QYKX10 Eye Pieces (Classical Naked Eye)]].  Unfortunately, not every piece of music that deserves a high definition format has yet to receive it, but it is fitting that this, [[ASIN:B000A2GJVW I Robot]], and [[ASIN:B00049QNMG The Turn of a Friendly Card]] have at long last made it into a proper high definition format.on format has yet to receive it, but it is fitting that this, [[ASIN:B000A2GJVW I Robot]], and [[ASIN:B00049QNMG The Turn of a Friendly Card]] have at long last made it into a proper high definition format.
0316776963|5.0|Yes, yes, yes!  By far my favorite of his books.  It follows a clear path of his life and is generally a great read.  If I ever want someone to read a David Sedaris book I start them here.  It shows off his unique writing style and his wild stories perfectly. I had some issues with a few of his books being hard to follow because his stories constantly jump, but this one follows perfectly and is easy to follow.  The stories are laugh out loud funny.  Would recommend anyone read this book.
B00049QNMG|5.0|If much of Peter Gabriel's lasting artistic legacy will be the principled stands he has taken for the cause of human rights, then a similar legacy should linger long after Eric Woolfson for his insights into the human tragedies of gambling addiction.  While many superficial songs have been written on the subject, [[ASIN:B00049QNMG The Turn of a Friendly Card]] explores the excitement and disappointment, the folly and the wisdom that can sometimes come when there is [[ASIN:B0017SV3QO Nothing Left To Lose]].  That song, in particular, embodies an uplifting melody around starkly somber lyrics that together create a sense of quiet resignation, a singularly unique emotion not heard in many songs.  But as deeply as this concept album delves into these themes of mental addiction and the power of choice versus the unconscious, Woolfson delves even deeper in his musical GAMBLER where additionally the primal male fantasies of heroism are turned against the hero.  This album benefits from not only the stellar production and engineering of Alan Parsons, but also from two of the finest instrumentals Parsons has ever composed: [[ASIN:B0017SYRDU The Gold Bug]] and [[ASIN:B0017SSZ1K The Ace Of Swords]].<br /><br />If asked just what was The Alan Parsons Project, the simple answer would be a couple of musical geniuses who had the good sense to surround themselves with a bunch of other musical geniuses.  Even a casual interest in the liner notes will reveal the unique talents of Andrew Powell who was solely responsible for all of the Project's orchestral arrangements.  But far less obvious would be the tremendous contributions that guitarist Ian Bairnson made throughout the life of the Project in terms of arrangement and, all too often, extremely complicated key changes.  On [[ASIN:B0017T0FVW I Don't Wanna Go Home]] in particular, Bairnson places a single sheet of paper between the strings and the pickup of his guitar in order to achieve an almost unheard organic quality to his playing.  Even Chris Rainbow deserves much more praise for his \\"rainbow effect\\" vocal harmonies laden throughout The Project catalog and showcased on the bonus material [[ASIN:B0017SSYXO Nothing Left To Lose (Chris Rainbow Overdub Vocal Compilation)]] from the more recent remaster.<br /><br />While I have heard some refer to The Alan Parsons Project as a poor man's Pink Floyd, I contend strongly that [[ASIN:B00049QNMG The Turn of a Friendly Card]] stands toe to toe with the best efforts Pink Floyd ever put forth.  The range of styles, tempos, and moods are as diverse as those on The Floyd's most successful album [[ASIN:B00008CLOA Dark Side of the Moon 30th Anniversary Edition]], but that should come as no surprise considering Parsons' substantial involvement in recording and engineering that masterpiece.  While this album's influence may not go as deep and wide despite the success of the singles [[ASIN:B0017T0FWG Time]] and [[ASIN:B0017T0FXU Games People Play]], it certainly should given the relevance of the subject matter in modern societies where gambling is more widely sanctioned than ever.<br /><br />(Of the high-definition audio discs Classic Records has released by The Alan Parsons Project, this particular one would be the lesser of the three.  While certainly an improvement over the original compact disc released by Arista,  it should also be noted that there is quite a bit of tape hiss on this rendering.  I would only recommend this HDAD over Sony's recent remaster if dynamic range is your chief concern.  I actually prefer the overall presentation of Sony's Direct Stream Digital remaster, but the HDAD does get the honorary nod when it comes to dynamic range.)n Chris Rainbow deserves much more praise for his \\"rainbow effect\\" vocal harmonies laden throughout The Project catalog and showcased on the bonus material [[ASIN:B0017SSYXO Nothing Left To Lose (Chris Rainbow Overdub Vocal Compilation)]] from the more recent remaster.

While this album's influence may not go as deep and wide despite the success of the singles [[ASIN:B0017T0FWG Time]] and [[ASIN:B0017T0FXU Games People Play]], it certainly should given the relevance of the subject matter in modern societies where gambling is more widely sanctioned than ever.    (Of the high-definition audio discs Classic Records has released by The Alan Parsons Project, this particular one would be the lesser of the three.  While certainly an improvement over the original compact disc released by Arista,  it should also be noted that there is quite a bit of tape hiss on this rendering.  I would only recommend this HDAD over Sony's recent remaster if dynamic range is your chief concern.  I actually prefer the overall presentation of Sony's Direct Stream Digital remaster, but the HDAD does get the honorary nod when it comes to dynamic range.)

1600240003|3.0|I have read most of the Harry Bosch novels and I have enjoyed each of them immensely.  The three stars that I have given this book should not be construed to mean that I didn't enjoy it.  But measured against the other offerings it fell a bit short (literally and figuratively).  Perhaps because it was originally published as a newspaper serial?<br /><br />I love how each of the Bosch novels provides the reader with a distinct feeling of place and time.  Though most are set in L.A. each novel has an aura all its own.  A good deal of the setting of this book takes place in the murder victim's home.  This gives the book a bit less spacious feel than some of the other Bosch novels.  This isn't bad, per se, but I tend to enjoy Harry bouncing around from L.A. to Vegas to the wilderness of the hills of Los Angeles County, etc.  Granted, the total time that expired in this novel was only about 12 hours - so he was a bit limited in geographic scope due to the brevity of the case.<br /><br />I wasn't real hip on the new partner either.  Iggy seems like kind of a tool bag, though the character was not exactly fully developed by Connelly.  I think Connelly might have been going for a bit of a father figure angle with the tandem but it was never explored with much detail or zeal.  It might work - but Harry needs someone who is a bit more proactive in order for it to be believed that he would take the time and effort to mentor him.<br /><br />Overall, good book - not great.  But even an average Harry Bosch is better than the vast majority of turd bales posing as paperbacks floating around out there these days in the detective mystery genre.

This album is current, energetic, and rich with the melodic strength which has always defined A-ha.  Get this one!
0765350386|5.0|I've never written a book review, and I read quite a lot--about one every two weeks. I picked up Mistborn mainly because I, like probably many of us Jordan fans out there, are a bit paranoid that Sanderson can't fill his shoes with the final Wheel of Time books. My doubts have evaporated.       Robin Hobb, Robert Jordan, Tolkein, Goodkind, and Weiss are my favorite sci-fi authors, and when choosing another author, I tend to rely on recommendations from readers of these authors. And if Hobb herself suggests it, well then...    The other reviews tell enough of the plot, and what sets Mistborn apart from other sci-fi series. I haven't read the other two yet, but I have high hopes.  I simply couldn't put this down. Funny, sad, thrilling, non-stop action.  It's a 'must-read', a refresher after so much of 'the same'-- special swords, amulets, words or flying hand movements.  I'd give it six stars if I could.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|For Dexter (Michael C. Hall) the third season of \\"Dexter\\" isn't the charm but killer. The results are one of Dexter's most challenging years as the only avenging serial killer out there.<br /><br />The third season of \\"Dexter\\" starts off a bit unexpectedly for our main character; Dexter accidently kills the youngest brother of the Assistant district attorney (Jimmy Smits). When Dexter ends up hunting down the RIGHT guy (who the ADA believes killed his brother)a bond is forged quite unexpectantly and with some unusual consequences later in the season.<br /><br />While the second season was quite good, the third proves to be the charm for \\"Dexter\\" settling the show back into the groove of the higher quality groove of the first season. As usual Michael C. Hall and the rest of the supporting cast are, as usual, marvelous with the writing and direction up to the same standard. As with the second season the third season of \\"Dexter\\" veers into uncharted territory departing from the novel that inspired the series and provided the basis for the first season of the show.<br /><br />Image quality for the Blu-ray looks quite good. Dialogue is always crystal clear and even the menus are good here (an improved on the amateur quality of the first season). The only complaint I have is that this isn't subtitled unless you access the subtitles for the hard of hearing menu. Most subtitles can be activated on DVD just by pushing subtitles and activating it (the same for Blu-ray). It's nice to have that option at the flick of a finger in case you're watching the show while others are asleep.<br /><br />The third season of \\"Dexter\\" continues to have surprising developments for all the characters and a couple of new characters as well. 4 1/2 stars only because one or two episodes are a bit underdeveloped and the lack of substanial extras (aside from the bonus episodes from other Showtime TV shows a great marketing tool but a cop out for fans of the show) but otherwise highly recommended.
0061547840|5.0|A book about success, managing and leading ideas has to include The Donald.  This is a very well written book - also a quick and easy read - with many stories about the greatness of Mr. Trump.  And when he feigns modesty, Bill Zanker, the founder of the Learning Annex, steps up with some great Trump stories.  However, Donald has done and accomplished much - he has been at the top only to fall toward the bottom and then to rise up even higher.  This alone is an accomplishment that business managers and future leaders should read about and can learn from.<br /><br />The book gives specific circumstances and ways to handle them.  The Donald, being such a well known public figure that always appears to tell it like it is, brings to the book a familiarity and personality that we know and can relate to - even though very few can much the wide breath of Trump's activities.  Bill Zanker started a small business that grew after he made a bold move by paying Donald Trump $1,000,000 to make a presentation at his Learning Annex and promising Trump he would deliver 15 to 20 times more students than had previously attended a single program.<br /><br />The book is written in a parallel style with Trump's stories and advise and Zanker's experiences growing his business.  I like it - if anything it keeps the pace moving.  The main focus of the book is thinking big, bold and out of the box.  The kick ass part is not much of my liking, but because of the gossipy style, keeps the book moving.<br /><br />Some of the specifics in the book are the need to surround yourself with great dedicated and bright people, recognize the time that bold moves are necessary and acting on them, have a passion for what you do, importance of the right timing, using your instincts but only after you've done all your homework and gathered all your backup support - no one becomes successful like Trump without planning, preparation and hard work.  Trump uses a quote by golf legend Gary Player who has said \\"the harder I work, the luckier I get.\\"  Not to fall into clich&eacute;s, some are fully appropriate and there is a chapter subheading that says \\"Good luck happens when opportunity meets preparation.\\"<br /><br />Other things in the book talk about being open to new ideas and opportunities, making learning fun, leveraging momentum, be focused, branding is important - it tells people what to expect and a high end quality brand makes it easier to deal, always have a prenuptial agreement - and a business shareholders' or partners' agreement, look successful - how you dress is important, and enjoy what you do.<br /><br />I don't agree with the revenge part of the book.  My way of dealing with people who screwed me is put them out of my mind and forget about them and not waste any energy on them - except if I cross paths with them in a new deal and then I do what I could to have them not get too far in that endeavor.luckier I get.\\"  Not to fall into clichés, some are fully appropriate and there is a chapter subheading that says \\"Good luck happens when opportunity meets preparation.\\"    Other things in the book talk about being open to new ideas and opportunities, making learning fun, leveraging momentum, be focused, branding is important - it tells people what to expect and a high end quality brand makes it easier to deal, always have a prenuptial agreement - and a business shareholders' or partners' agreement, look successful - how you dress is important, and enjoy what you do.

015206396X|5.0|Wow, what can I say about this book. I don't often take the time to write a review even though I have enjoyed so many books.  I guess this one stands out because it wasn't recommended by Stephenie Meyer ---I found it on my own and fell in love with the story.  I had just finished reading The Time Traveler's Wife so my mind was still in Henry and Clare's world and my expectation wasn't real high as this is her debut novel and the 1st 6 chapters, my mind was still on Henry & Clare. By the 7th chapter though, I left Henry & Clare to their world and moved on to Katsa's world and was hooked.  From then on--you won't want to put this novel down.  It is such a different and unique world and to watch Katsa change during the story and actually have her heart mended and fall in love and be loved is awesome.  I love the possibility of Graces--yes you will have to read the story.  The end only made me want more --a sequel and from what I found a pre-quel comes out in October followed by a sequel.  I can not wait to see Bitterblue grow up and see how great of a Queen she will be.  Even though it is 14 and older, I plan on letting my 10 year read it as the love scenes are left for your own imagination.  I highly suggest to buy this book!
0316010669|4.0|I didn't expect much when I started BLINK. Then only a few pages in, as Gladwell is describing the manner in which a University of Washington professor is able to tell with 90% accuracy if a couple will divorce based on 5 MINUTES of speaking with them based on snap judgments, I WAS HOOKED. I spent the majority of the three days I took to read the book periodically stopping and then reading allowed passages to anyone who would listen.<br /><br />Although Gladwell covers a wide range of scenarios from music, to relationships, to merchandising, to police brutality, to prejudice, everything was well connected through the theme of how our snap judgments affect even the smallest portions of our lives. Two seemingly random scenarios were illuminated and connected in ways I might never have thought.<br /><br />I walked away from BLINK hoping that I could take his advice and that by being aware of my snap judgments I could hope to have a deeper understand my subconscious. Although I feel that I may never really understand my own snap judgments, it was wonderful while reading this book to at least begin to 'try.'

B001UNSZSA|3.0|First I have to admit that this was never my favorite Doors album. The writing is inconsistent. The band though decided along with their producer to tackle something they'd never done before--create an album with elaborate orchestral arrangements. On songs like \\"Touch Me\\" and the opening track the orchestra adds nice color to the band's music. Guitarist Robby Kreiger provides most of the tunes here and while he isn't the best lyricist, the music more than makes up for his shortcomings in that area. \\"Shaman's Blues\\" and \\"Wild Child\\" are two other highlights that contrast nicely with the experimentation of using a full orchestra and the rambling but fascinating title track.<br /><br />Steve Hoffman completes his remastering of The Doors catalog with this album and \\"Morrison Hotel\\" (which is a strong album than this but isn't quite as varied). \\"The Soft Parade\\" has never sounded so good on CD. Hoffman does a nice job with the album and provides us with two bonus tracks for comparison--the remixed versions of \\"The Soft Parade\\", \\"Touch Me\\" from the recently remixed/remastered effort by original engineer Bruce Botnick. It's nice to compare the two and while the remixes sound really good, I prefer the original analog two track masters as presented here to the remixes. They have a bit more punch and character.<br /><br />Interestingly, if you look at the sound waves there does appear to be some peak limiting on the track \\"Touch Me\\" but unless you listen for it very carefully you might not hear it (you'd have to listen to it on exceptional equipment). Nevertheless, \\"The Soft Parade\\" sounds exceptionally good. I haven' heard an explanation as to WHY it appears that some peak limiting appears to be going on when the packaging mentions that no peak limiting has been used.<br /><br />We get a booklet with the original lyrics included as part of the package as well. This is available in a limited numbered edition so if you are a big Doors fan you'll probably want to snatch this up as soon as possible. While it might seem redundant in the wake of the remixed/remastered catalog reissued last year, these are the best sounding versions of the original mixes I've heard.p as soon as possible.

1932100660|5.0|The China Study offers compelling evidence, based both on laboratory research and a huge epidemiological study in China, for being a vegan.  Dr Campbell is a renowned long time research scientist at Cornell who is not given to exaggeration or jumping on bandwagons.  He did not become a vegan himself until late in his career after looking at both the laboratory research and epidemiological evidence from China and seeing how much they both led to the same conclusion: animal protein is bad for your health.  His book is written for the lay person but has extensive references to support his statements.  My wife and I became vegans after reading The China Study and have found it surprisingly easy to maintain.  Prior to becoming vegans we ate what is considered a normal American diet.  In terms of reducing the cost of health care in this country, which is crucial if this country is to maintain its leadership role in the world and if we are to have the money needed to improve our education system, infrastructure, health care system, maintain our military, etc, veganism on a mass scale would greatly reduce health care costs which would free up money to do these other things.
1602728631|5.0|I'm not a fan of paranormal romance. A lot of times, the paranormal aspects suffer. And fantasy romance? Please. I can't remember the last time I read a keeper. If it wasn't horribly under-thought mages, angels, or pretty fae-ries, it was something cute and saccharine. Or horrible world-building that placed too much emphasis on sex.<br /><br />This book changed my mind.<br /><br />Sure, it's from a publisher I don't frequent, and it's labeled erotica, but it's mis-labeled. Put this in a ROC or DAW cover, and you'll have an idea of just how good this book really is.<br /><br />Silhara is the most snarky, over-the-top, nothing held back dark hero I've read in years. He's selfish, nasty, contemptuous and violent--and the most enthralling blend of honor and integrity. Martise is plain and lacking in the common kick-ass, I'm-too-beautiful-for-my-own-good heroine attributes. I was pretty iffy that Draven could carry off what appeared to me to be an astoundingly ambitious transformational character arc on both sides, but she did it with flair. It's the most amazingly gritty, realistic, and carefully built story I've read in years.<br /><br />No spoilers here. But if you're a fan of early Patricia Briggs, Hambly's Star-Hawk and Sun-Wolf series, or Sharon Lee's Liaden series, you will thank yourself for buying it. Grace Draven is a name to watch.

B00009ATIX|1.0|The director and producer are so busy trying to prove to us how witty, intelligent and arty they are that they apparently forgot to make a good film.  The book is so full of potential, but they missed the opportunity entirely.  I much prefer Tarkovsky's version even though it often tends to prolong itself unneccesarily.<br /><br />Here we have people acting completely irrationally.  Sure, you'd expect people under mental and emotional distress to act irrationally, but even Charles Manson would probably be scratching his head watching the characters in this movie.  A lot of the problems with this film could have to do with parts that were edited out, which it's pretty obvious that there was a good amount of material left on the cutting room floor.  I can see why Jim Cameron stepped away from the director's chair.  He probably saw where this was headed early on.<br /><br />And there are two things that really grate on my nerves.  One of them is Jeremy Davies' method of acting.  The other is obnoxious gum chewers.  In this movie you've got Jeremy Davies obnoxiously chewing gum through pretty much the whole thing.<br /><br />Read the book or get yourself a copy of the Tarkovsky original.  I have the Criterion edition - it's well worth it unless you just can't stand subtitles.  But avoid the Soderbergh travesty at all costs.
B0021L8US0|4.0|\\"District 9\\" is as much social satire as it is a sci-fi thriller, and this multi-layered approach results in some horrifying comments that would be hilarious if you didn't think about what they meant.  Shot in part-documentary (a la \\"The Office\\"), part-adventure-movie style, \\"District 9\\" is set in Johannesburg, South Africa, in a future where aliens have been stranded on Earth and their enormous mothership is hovering, disabled, above the city.  The aliens, called \\"prawns\\" by the humans because of their appearance, have been moved into a gigantic slum where they are, for lack of a better word, de-humanized by the atrocious conditions -- famine, filth, and laws meant to oppress them.  When the government agency overseeing them decides that they should be moved out of the city to a more convenient location, the conflict is set in motion.  Wimpy, over-eager, and (at first) unsympathetic Wikus (Sharlto Copley) becomes the unlikely protagonist as the film thrusts viewers in the midst of the horrifying reality of Wikus's fate in the alien slums and his interactions with Christopher, an alien who knows more than the rest.<br /><br />The satire here is dark and deep, with moments like Wikus gleefully pointing out the popping sound of alien eggs exploding in a fire.  That Wikus can love his wife so deeply and yet feel no remorse when aliens are blown away serves as a powerful contradiction.  While the parallels to apartheid are heavy-handed, the film moves forward with such speed that that realization doesn't linger or spoil the overall effect.  In fact, this link between human race relations history and the situation of the aliens gives this film its context.  Without it, the audience might be cheering for the destruction of the aliens instead of experiencing discomfort or, in more pointed moments, horror.  This is not your typical aliens-from-outer-space flick.<br /><br />The cinematography uses dingy hues to evoke a desperate world, with humans at their cruelest.  The looming mothership is frightening, even though it is disabled, and it reminds the audience of who is usually the aggressor in such films.  This makes the alien violence against humans both expected and sad, because if we were in their position, we would rebel as well.<br /><br />Be forewarned: this is a violent, disturbing film.  The end of the movie points toward a sequel in three years, so expect \\"District 10\\" to surface in the near future, especially given the commercial success of \\"District 9.\\"<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmannis frightening, even though it is disabled, and it reminds the audience of who is usually the aggressor in such films.

If you want a great read stick with \\"Kane & Able\\" or \\"Prisoner at Birth\\", and you will be much happier.

B00000F214|4.0|The film itself is worthy of a very strong five-star rating, but since this Blu-Ray offers nothing beyond the film itself, my rating reflects my disappointment.<br /><br />While it's fantastic to have one of my favorite films of all time in high definition at last, the extras here are non-existent.  Not only did they not do anything special for the Blu-Ray, they didn't even port over the extras from the MGM Special Edition DVD that came out a few years ago, and there's some excellent stuff on that DVD.<br /><br />Shame on Fox/MGM for this inexcusably-lacking release.

B000002JSP|3.0|I bought this for bonzo`s masterpiece of drumming \\"Fool In The Rain\\"  His version of the halftime shuffle on that track is one for the ages. He gets your attention with the finely layered hi hat and ghost note snare pattern that features accents on the down beats on the hi hat.    Then, he lays into a quarter note triplet ride pattern for the chorus while keeping the bass drum pattern the same as the verse.  All the while his left foot is playing an eighth note hi hat time keeping rhythm.  Definitely His best work in my opinion, and i`m a bonzo type of drummer who knows his entire catalog. The rest of the CD is okay featuring tunes like \\"In The Evening\\", \\"Carouselambra\\"  and \\"All Of My Love\\" but none of them compare to their earlier work or \\"Fool In The Rain\\".

B00164GDD2|4.0|If you remember the eighties, there is no way you don't remember Ghostbusters. This film was more than just a movie when it came out, it was an event. Who didn't have one of those T-Shirts? I think I still have mine somewhere...<br /><br />Of course, I wouldn't be writing this review if I thought the movie was simply all hype. Beneath all the marketing, toys and catchy song lies a very funny film. The type of comedy we hardly see these days. Ghostbusters is quite a clever mix of comedy along with bits of other genres including a bit of horror. The anchor being the great performances of Dan Akroyd, Harold Ramis, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson, all in the peak of their careers in comedy at the time. I'm not going to go real deep into the film as I want to discuss the Blu-Ray transfer but it's a great script, has wonderful acting and a great pace. The special effects might look a bit out of date in this age of CG but some hold up pretty well more then 20 years later.<br /><br />So this film is finally available in HD and its looking great. A lot of the details lost over the years are back and the colors, especially the ones involving the special effects come out strong and bright. Even when in theaters, the film had a grainy, subdued look to it, similar to Saving Private Ryan. Whether that was the director's intent or simply bad quality film, the years were certainly not helpful in improving it. A lot was lost when the film was finally released on VHS and DVD did nothing to help that. This BD really does the film justice but it is by no means comparable to recent releases. The film is after all, over 20 years old. But there is no doubt this is the best this film has looked ever. Better perhaps than in theaters.<br /><br />Where this release really shines is in the Special Features department, with a plethora of content from multiple commentaries to documentaries. They not only have included material from when the film came out along with extras from previous releases but brand new content as well. Especially noteworthy is the inclusion of a picture in picture track where several people, among them Ivan Reitman, Dan Akroyd and the other actors, producers and other people involved in the film comment along with the movie. Must see stuff!<br /><br />Ghostbusters is a must-buy in and of itself so I would recommend it to anyone who likes comedy but this release really sweetens the deal. The transfer is awesome, the extras are many and that song... well who can forget that?ll.

0553213105|5.0|Two hundred Years this book has been around & still a bestseller. Sure the language is verbose & flowery , But Never has one book spawned hundreds of cookie cutter wannabees. Nothing will ever compare to the wonder that is this book. Jane Austen was a people watcher,I'll bet. As a writer, Jane Knew how to get under the characters skin to bare their souls of what mattered to them. What still matters to us.<br />It was a satire of the times. Middle Class Women had to marry well because if they didn't they would be homeless or working at the lowest of jobs.So,alot of times they married the first dude that asked them to dance.I think Jane saw how unhappy the women surrounding her were in marraiges without any common ground or affection.<br />She also explores the intricities of marriage and how differant personalities date and eventually marry. For some love for starts like a raging fire only to evaporate in middle age, for some love seems to elude them for no good reason ,and for others it comes softly at the strangest time. Some couples are dear friends, some roommates,others HAD TO GET MARRIED.<br />Above all ,Ms. Austen shows us that Love can be savage,beautiful,tragic ,sudden,brutal,frightening,awkward,exciting,mysterious and confusing. That, my friends will never change.<br />If this isn't enough reason to read this book, At least check it out for Lizzy Bennet and her well meaning,goofy mother, who loves playing matchmaker. Even though she is bad at it.Lizzy is everywoman. The men want to date her and women want to be like her.
0198326769|2.0|The genius in this book is in the idea:- set a book at a concentration camp told through the eyes of an absurdly naiive German boy who meets up with a Jewish (prisoner) boy every day.      Yet the actual book itself is really dull for the first 130 pages or so (out of about 190).  The reason we keep reading is because we know our history and we know something terrible must happen in the end and can't help ourselves.  Almost all the 'child-like' touches (such as 9-year old Bruno thinking that the Fuhrer is called the Fury) ring untrue and are clearly devices used by the author to manipulate the reader.  Luckily for the author, readers love to be manipulated.  What adds to the dullness is that we never get close to any character (not even Bruno, who is merely a cipher for the author's 'child-like' voice).  The only real and potentially interesting character is the old Jewish man who plays waiter in Bruno's household.  There is an unspoken menace when he is attacked by the young German soldier and a touching tenderness when he tends to Bruno's injury.    It must be said that the ending is a real page-turner and the book, like anything to do with the holocaust, really makes you think and wonder at the cruelty humans are capable of.    But even so, this book is hugely over-rated.
B000ETQR3Q|3.0|This gun is over rated.  Everone praises it accuracy and long range, but I can get better results with the Maverick and it's quicker.  I bought this for my son and it is a bit much for him.  He is six, but 4' tall.  The gun is difficult for him to use due to the complexity of loading it and the sequence that you have to do it in for the gun to function.  I would look at other models and not waist my money.  Make sure to read the reviews and take everyone's comments for what they are worth.
0345495004|3.0|This book prompted me to look for a photo album of long ago.  Pictures I had taken while touring around Chicago and, of course, they include several buildings/homes by Frank Lloyd Wright.  Little did I know, back then, about his personal life.  \\"Loving Frank\\" was a bit of an eye opener.  It is fiction based on true facts.  Mr. Lloyd Wright and Mrs. Mamah Cheney, the wife of a client, met and fell in love, eloping in the early 1900s, leaving behind their respective spouses and children.  The impact their love story made was quite devastating for them both, and especially for Mamah, branded as an unfit mother, as someone living outside the conventional rules, placing her love for a man before anything else.  Naturally Frank had his share of problems too.  He had abandoned a wife and six children himself, however his actions were probably more \\"acceptable\\" at the time, because he was a man.         The author gives voice to their side of the story and this of course is the fictitious part of the book, although much research into the facts has clearly been done.    Questions arise.  Undoubtedly leaving everything behind took some guts, especially at the time, especially for a woman.  The author is never judgmental though.  I think her reconstruction of the events is quite plausible and she certainly makes the reader visualize the inner quality and beauty of their true love, their intellectual affinity, their remorse and sense of guilt towards their families.  It is an engaging love story, ending abruptly several years later.  If you still do not know why (that is when facts come into the picture), I shall not spoil it for you.    The book also offers an interesting insight into Mr. Lloyd Wright's work, from a different perspective.  Well done to the author.
B0029LHW4A|2.0|I'm a HUGE Jet fan. I was anticipating this album's release since I heard about it 2 months ago, counting down..<br /><br />Then I heard the single.. I thought it was a bit more polished than I was used to, but I enjoyed it..<br /><br />Then I bought it yesterday.. release day. I popped it in..<br /><br />...honestly, it never grabbed me. The songs are all mid tempo and never quite have that anthemic feel you come to expect from Jet. I was hoping to hear that fist pumping catchy/hooky rock that we've come to expect, instead we get a very polished (almost too polished) collection of pop songs that are on the verge of trying to bust out, but never quite does.<br /><br />I've listened to it 4 times already really trying to like it. Honestly. I just can't.
B000VDDDY6|3.0|Unlike many reviewers so far, I'm ok with the new CGI. I'm not ok with HD on one side and DVD on the other. I am not sure which format this is but it may be dvd-18, which is well known to exhibit problems. I expereinced this with many other sets, such as The Best of Abbott & Costello volumes 1-4. The re-released box set has no problems and came in single discs per movie.     This is a tempting set but once again, a motion picture studio company screwed it up with cheap formatting and packaging.    [...]
B000V86OKG|3.0|Dexter is my favorite live action TV show that airs regularly now (aside from Corner Gas, my other favorite). This season is pretty awesome, like Season One. Dexter is playing this one by the skin of his teeth because his main body stash was discovered in the first episode, and his rival, Doakes, is on to him. Great drama.<br /><br />Sadly, while I want to give this season 5 stars, I really can't because the first new box I got had a semi circle on disc one preventing me from watching part of episode 2 on disc 1. Amazon sent me a replacement (great job), but on the replacement, the disc 2 had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM. DVD quality is suffering with this problem lately. I can't encourage folks to buy an iffy purchase when the dvd's may be messed up, now can I? Taking two dvd boxes ot make ONE is kind of silly, and it's a good thing I waited to return my original copy to Amazon or I'd be in the same boat AGAIN.
0060557818|3.0|This is definately a different kind of book.  I thought it was very creative...but I have to admit I found myself confused.  I found the story hard to follow but I did enjoy most of it.  It's an ok read.
B000001ELP|4.0|In 1981, when Music from \\"The Elder\\" came out, it was very confusing to the fans.  There were no pictures of KISS on it anywhere (with the exception of Paul's hand on the front cover) and people weren't really sure what it was.  Was it a soundtrack for an upcoming movie?  Was it a concept album?  Was this really KISS?  After alienating their fans with the disco-tinted Unmasked, and the departure of Peter Criss from the band, KISS were in serious trouble.  Sure, they were rich and famous, but thier fans were really starting to hate them and that isn't good if you want to continue on as a money-making act.  Something that always bothered Gene and Paul was the fact that most of the critics dismissed their work as mediocre, bubblegum rock with a lot of flash and bang and very little substance.  They sang mostly about women.  They acted like crazy, drunken sex maniacs.  They breathed fire and spit blood and so what!!!  They were KISS and that was the formula that had made them household names in the first place.  So Gene, while sitting in the Beverly Palms Hotel, decides to write the story of The Elder, to create a concept album, to wow the critics and gain some respect.  Now, Gene has admitted all these years later, that this was one of the worst mistakes of his career with KISS.  Ace didn't want any part of it.  The produce Bob Ezrin was intrigued.  They would hire an orchestra to do the score, hire actors to play background parts, go crazy with the myth and mystique of The Elder.  The critics would love them!  Praise them!  Sing songs to their insight and cleverness!  Once and for all KISS would be regaled as true American rock legends.  No.  The Elder is the only KISS album never to reach gold status.  Sad, but true.  Did they mean well?  Hard to say.  KISS was a band in disarray, directionless and surrounded by well-wishers whispering in their ears.  So, Music from \\"The Elder\\" was born without a clear explanation, without anything for the fans to look to for guidance.  There it was.This is also the world's introduction to Eric Carr on album.  You can feel what a great drummer he was. Let's look at the tracks:<br /><br />Fanfare:  Just that.  Nothing more.<br /><br />Just A Boy -  Musically, this was some of their best work as a band, though it mostly Gene and Paul and Eric.  Ace would send his stuff in from his home.  A sprawling, well-produced effort.  Today, it stands out.  The fans were just confused.  This intro song is supposed to set the tone for the rest of the album.  Good song.<br /><br />Odyssey -  This is operatic KISS.  This is grand and glorious KISS.  Like I said before, it stands out with no expectations.  This album would have made more sense after the makeup was gone.  It was too complex for what KISS was as a band.  This had nothing to do with banging groupies by the busload.  Aother good song.  Piano and orchestra.  The lyrics are thoughtful.  The production is elegant.<br /><br />Only You - Moody, brooding Gene tune with some great riffs and a good feel.  Each song builds upon the next.  The Elder was not a bad album by far, it was just too confusing for disgruntled fans and KISS were never going to win the critics appeal so they were wasting their time. You make music for yourself and for your fans.  Live by it or die by it.<br /><br />Under The Rose -  One of the better songs on the album.  This dark, whispery feel sets the dark mood perfectly.  I like it.  You can't hate The Elder, you just need to take it for what it is.  This was KISS showing that they could be insightful.  That they could keep up with the bands of the time with their musical and lyrical talent.  There really wasn't a need to compete.  KISS were gods among insects compared to most bands.  But by 1981 they had falled considerably.  My mom knew who KISS was in 1977.  By 1981, she couldn't remember who they were.  That is a downfall.<br /><br />Dark Light - The single Ace tune on the album.  Typical Ace in its simple greatness.  He alwaysdelivered, even under the strain of losing direction with the band.  This is a solid rocker and another standout track.  Ace understood that this was a huge mistake but he still made his own contribution.  Dark Light is one of my favorite songs on the album.  Plus it's great to hear Ace's New York accent when he sings.  Great solo.<br /><br />A World Without Heroes -  Probably one of the best songs Gene has ever written.  This is such a great song, but fans couldn't believe that the fire-breathing, blood-spitting demon was capable of stuff of this caliber.  Perfect.  I could listen to this over and over again.<br /><br />The Oath - Great song.  Comes right out of the gate and take you by the throat.  Listening to this now, it so hard to understand why this album bombed, but then 1981 was such a different time.  These guys made a huge, wasted effort.  There are so many fans out there that bug the band to do an all-Elder set.  This is like their Wall or their Mindcrime or their 2112.<br /><br />Mr. Blackwell -  I remember back in the day my mother wouldn't let me listen to KISS because she thought that they were evil.  My best friend had them plastered all over his room, so I begged him to make me a tape and he did and I used to sneak into my bedroom just to listen to them.  Mr. Blackwell was on that tape.  I don't know why, but my friend liked the song so he included it with all the KISS standards like Deuce and Rock And Roll All Nite and Detroit Rock City.  Mr. Blackwell.  Most people don't even know this song if it's mentioned.  It was one of my first impressions of KISS and remains one of my favorite songs of all time.  This is Gene at his best.  You can picture the demon singing this.  This is the next step up from God Of Thunder.  Excellent.  We'll drink a toast to the inhuman race...<br /><br />Escape From The Island -  Rocking instumental that ties Mr. Blackwell to the final song.  This is great.  KISS really tried their damnedest on this album to pull out all the stops and the critics ignored it but what they came up with was a masterpiece that is so overlooked it's nearly sad.  The pounding metal goodness that flows from this song kicks you in the face and Eric really lets go here.<br /><br />I - Great, anthemic album ender.  The funny thing about \\"The Elder\\" was that you could feel the excitement, the sense of accomplisment in each song and it was such a disaster.<br /><br />\\"Morpheus, you have ben summoned here to offer your judgement of the boy.  Do you still deem him worthy of the fellowship?\\"<br /><br />After listening to Music from \\"The Elder\\"  you will be left with a sense of 'what just happened?' because the story of The Elder is never really explained, but if you look beyond that simple fact, you will have realized that you have just been rocked.  This is KISS against the wall, in the corner, fighting for thier musical lives, and it would have been so much more awesome if Ace had embraced the project whole-heartedly.  This very well could have been the best KISS album ever.  But commercially, it failed, and critically it was overlooked.  We were fools in 1981, so listening to Music from \\"The Elder\\" now gives us a better perspective of what KISS was capable of doing.  They never had anything to prove to anyopne but themselves, and if they had stuck to the formula that created KISS and made it great, the four original members would still be playing together.<br /><br />Dig it!ection with the band.

B00000F169|2.0|I am a big fan of John Carpenter, who has directed three or four of the best horror movies of the past several decades, and at least two of the greatest ever made; and who is one of the smartest guys in the biz (his film commentaries are among the best, even for mediocre movies like Ghosts of Mars).     Nonetheless, though I really wanted to like this movie, I have to come down on the side of the minority and give it two stars. I understand the film's place in cinema history, FX history, the history of indie cinema, and it's place within the Carpenter canon; but it is only intermittently funny, and surprisingly boring in parts - surprisingly, because Carpenter is a lot of things, but this is the only instance in which I found his work boring.     For Carpenter aficionados, you owe it to yourself to watch this flick at least once, just in principle. Fans of ironic camp may also like it, at least for a rental. But the average viewer, I fear, will be annoyed and mystified. (If it had a commentary by Carpenter, that would be a different story, but the version I saw did not.)
0525421033|3.0|Since the major (external) action occurs early in the book and the remainder of the book consists largely of flashbacks, the novel lacks a certain drive.  The pace is slow.  It was interesting to read of a character dedicated to music.  I found the central character's family a little hard to credit, however.  The very end of the book is quite moving,but this was not nearly the emotional book I was led to expect by others' reviews and I was frankly disappointed and not overly stirred by it.  I borrowed the book from my local library and am glad I did as I don't think it's a title I'd read again.  This is a book for older girls and women, not early teens.
0385751893|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It mad me think about being on the other side of the fence.  Although, it didn't go into detail from the Jewish child side...it did from the Nazi child.  It was a little different perspective.  I do however think an adult needs to read this book with the child because if the child doesn't have knowledge of the hollocaust then it will be confusing.  I find this book educational for anyone...but especially a child.

B00284BMBM|4.0|Chris Daughtry's first CD, with studio musicians, was eh, ok.  'Leave This Town' is terrific.  He has his own band, he's written great songs, and spread his wings.  Granted, I have NEVER seen AI, but this may have kept me from any bias either way.    Girls are going to dig this CD much more than guys, IMHO.  Lots of love songs, lost love ballads, not many rockers.  And I would have left off 'Supernatural'.  But overall, sweet and thoughtful tunes.  You can listen to it over and over and not get bored of it.    Looking forward to his next CD.
B001TODCII|5.0|If you like a lot of action & violence this is the flick for you! I thought it was great.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|Before I get this review started, I must confess that I saw \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" twice in one weekend.  This is something that has NEVER happened to me.  Rarely do I even see a movie twice while it's still playing in theatres no matter how good it is.  I saw this Tarantino epic (it most certainly is epic, I kid you not) a second time with only a day separating my first viewing.<br /><br />If there is one thing certain about Quentin Tarantino, it is this:  He plays by nobody's rules but his own.  He could care less if you end up loving or hating a flick of his.  And while there will most certainly be those who will detest the \\"Basterds\\" in every way, there will be those who will fall head-over-heels for it.  Filled with great acting, excellent story and pacing, trademark Tarantino humor and at times over-the-top violence that can only be fitting for an epic such as this, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is an unforgettable experience.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, I will be as brief as possible when it comes to the story.  Seriously, the less you know the more surprising and fulfilling it will be.  As the first chapter states, \\"Once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France,\\" a group of Jewish-American soldiers called \\"The Basterds\\" are exacting revenge on any and all Nazis they encounter.  Brad Pitt is the leader of this outfit and he has made clear that no mercy is to be shown to them and that they are not in this to take prisoners.  The Nazis must be shown the exact same horror and violence that they themselves have inflicted on others.  A Jewish woman loses her entire family at the hands of the Nazis and when she comes to own a movie theater some years later, she surprisingly gets an opportunity for some retribution and revenge.<br /><br />Now, I know from my brief synopsis, it sounds like a mindless revenge thriller bent on non-stop action and carnage.  Hell, even the trailers present the film in such a light, but I can promise you that this is not the case.  The film is much more story and character oriented.  In fact, what you'll find more in this movie is maddening tension.  What can appear to be an innocent conversation can immediately transform into something more sinister.  The opening scene, which I will not explain what happens, is a great example of how tense Tarantino can make it with very little action.  The writing is confidently crafted, and the movie also plays like a foreign film since there are a lot of subtitles--but please, do not let that scare you away.  Brad Pitt is humorous and perfect for the role of \\"Lt. Aldo Raine.\\"  Christoph Waltz who plays \\"Col. Hans Landa\\" definitely deserves an Academy Award nomination for his outstanding portrayal of somebody who is so evil, and yet so terrifyingly calm and well mannered for the most part.<br /><br />\\"Inglourious Basterds\\" gets my vote of being the best film of '09 so far, and it's hard for me to imagine finding another movie that will top it.  It may not be for everyone, but it's for sure an experience you'll most likely not forget no matter what your overall feelings towards the film is in the end.  It is long and there is a lot of dialogue, but once you see it as a whole you'll realize it couldn't have been done any other way.  If you're looking for a non-stop action extravaganza, you will be disappointed.  An action extravaganza, this is not... this is a film, and a confident and daring one at that!

B0006B29Z2|5.0|This is a great documentary. I've been a Maiden fan since the first album, but I lost interest after Seventh Son. This DVD has definitely renewed my interest. The look behind the scenes with Steve Harris and the insight into the lineup changes are really informative; I had no idea that Maiden had probably fifteen different members prior to the first album's release. The highlight for me is the Live at the Rainbow show. I remember watching this concert on MTV (when they played videos) back when I was about 11 years old; it blew me away then, and it was neat to be reminded how good and tight they were, even at this early stage in their career. I recommend this DVD 100%.

B000A0GYD2|3.0|While I have to agree with other reviewers that this was a ground-breaking, and thoroughly enjoyable series, I must admit that every disk in my \\"Signature Edition\\" set (bought from Amazon) was of poor sound quality.  At times the music bass was so off that it boomed and vibrated so loudly that I couldn't hear the actors, while other times it was normal.  Unfortunately, I don't want to return the set due to shipping costs.  But, will I ever be able to re-watch it again with the sound the way it is?  No.  Will I ever buy another DVD set from Amazon again?  I'm not sure.  This experience will certainly make me think twice though.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This is the HBO concert from 1992 during the Dangerous Tour. The sound is 5.1 dolby and the picture quality is perfect. The version of Billy Jean during this show is simply amazing and alone is worth 10 times the cost of this dvd. This concert shows the brilliance of Michael Jackson and his concert magic.
1401902197|1.0|I have really appreciated all that Louise Hay's has done throughout the years, but the CD that comes with the book spends way too much time on the negative. I thought it was suppose to be inspiring affirmations. Instead, each track starts out for the first couple of minutes on how bad we are, I can't even listen to the CD. I can see mentioning on the first track that we need to be aware of how many negative thoughts are ruling us then go onto how we can improve those negative thoughts. You are supposed to focus on what you do want so I guess I will have to make my own CD. I still appreciate all Louise Hays has done, this review is just to express my confusion on what I thought I was purchasing, \\"positive affirmations\\"?
045122499X|4.0|I'm only about half way through World Without End.  It's good, but it's not as gripping as Pillars of the Earth.  When I read Pillars, I literally couldn't put it down.  I finished reading Pillars in around 10 days.  But, World is not catching my attention like that.  I'm still making good progress and I enjoy the story lines, but I started the book about two weeks ago and I'm only half way.  I would still recommend the reading.
B0000028M7|5.0|From the opening song \\"Them Bones\\" to the finally, \\"Would\\", it's pure ear candy. An essential album for all who appreciate either Grunge, Metal, AIC, or those rare standout musical works that just wear better and better over time. I wish the same could be said for today's music, but at least it'll be soon forgotten. It's also why I no longer listen to the radio.       The music industry did little in the way of promoting this group compared to the way they push today's trash down the throats of the masses, so don't be surprised if you come to believe you must've been sleeping under a rock when this music was first released.   I also recommend \\"Unplugged\\", \\"Facelift\\", and \\"Jar of Flies\\" to quadruple your pleasure. You'll thank me later.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|The super fast action sequences were ridiculous and laughable.  There was no time to process and enjoy the action.  Being hit with one super fast action after another was after a while boring.  Here we go again, I thought as I watched the movie.  It was like they created this Bond film with the intention to have the action sequences and special effects to be the stars of the movie rather than the gorgeous women and James Bond of earlier movies.  This is the worst Bond film ever made.
0143038419|2.0|After hearing all the hype, I bought the book and was psyched to read it. I was a little wary through the eat section, but thought it was pretty entertaining.  But by the time she got to India, I was completely over it. Pretentious, repetitive claptrap. If you are the type of person who likes \\"The Secret\\" this is in your wheelhouse, but people who aren't searching for a spiritual awakening (or who don't want to hear about the voices that guide us)should steer clear.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Hands down one of the best movies ever made!  Besides a few minor differences from the comic book, as well as a few parts left out, Watchmen stays true to the fans and newcomers, like myself.  There have been other great comic book movies, but this one is actually epic!  If you haven't seen this movie yet, just say, or whisper, \\"no\\" to the other comic book movies--and watch this immediately!
B000W9EOEC|5.0|I have to say that this album is their best live performance ever! They transition every song together perfectly. it's a must buy!
006088732X|5.0|I will have to say that at first I didn't like the book and put it down about 50 or so pages in, but later went back and finished it and loved it!  I have read the other books as well and I can't wait for book 8 to come out so I can know the ending.  It is a great mystery book and that maybe the reason I enjoy it so much.     There were some bad reviews about the first book, but as you continue to read, these girls don't get away with everything.  What they do eventually comes to light and unfortunatley messes things up for them.    I would recommend this book for sure, but I would recommend it be for teens 15 years plus.  I wouldn't give it to anyone younger.

0545123267|5.0|SHIVER  MAGGIE STIEFVATER  Paranormal YA  Scholastic    Rating: 4.5 Enchantments    Grace's fascination with the wolves in the forest behind her home stems from an attack that happened when she was young. Ever since, she's had a connection, with one wolf in particular with the beautiful yellow eyes. But when a teenager at her school is apparently killed by the wolves, the community is in an uproar and goes after the wolves. Desperate to save `her' wolf, Grace risks her own safety to go running into the forest, wanting to save both the wolf and her best friend who is out in the forest taking pictures. Ushered home, Grace finds an unbelievable sight on her back porch, a huddled up figure with the same eyes as her wolf.     Sam's been changing back and forth between a human and a wolf as the seasons change since a brutal attack on him as a child. His parents, unable to deal with what he had become, tried to kill him but he survived and was taken in by the local pack leader. But when a bullet hits him, he finds himself human again in the fall, a time when he shouldn't be. Sam's been in love with Grace for years, ever since he saved her from the wolf attack several years ago. Now in human form, he's desperate to make the most of the time the two have together, never knowing when the next cold weather is going to hit and make him change--this time permanently.    SHIVER is truly an enjoyable love story, with twists and turns that keep the reader hoping that Sam and Grace will find a way to keep him from turning back to the wolf, because as Sam fears, turning once more is something he may not be able to change back from. I really came to love these two characters over the course of the book, the way they cared about each other and the way Sam wanted to give Grace good memories to hold on to when he turned back. One of my favorite scenes is when he takes her to Duluth to the little candy store on a date. I loved the banter between the two and the way they truly cared aboutone another. Ms. Stiefvater has a very lyrical and enjoyable style, that keeps the reader turning the pages into well into the night.    Readers looking for something different in the paranormal genre should definitely try SHIVER.     Maggie Stiefvater is also the author of Lament: The Faerie Queen's Deception and Ballad: The Gathering of Faerie. Maggie lives in rural Virginia with her husband and their two children.

B0009X766Y|5.0|\\"The Sting\\" is an example of the finest film-making.  The acting is superb.  Robert Redford and Paul Newman showed their excellence in this film.  Along with a strong supporting cast, they make you care about the characters in such a way, you want to help in the \\"con\\" they are setting up.  Besides the excellent acting, the music, Scott Joplin ragtime, compliments the plot and sets the mood for every scene.  The direction of \\"The Sting\\" brought the script to life-it keeps the audience interested and involved with the story.<br /><br />\\"The Sting\\", set in 1930's, is about a couple con artists who set up a professional \\"con\\" on a mobster for revenge.  Robert Shaw was very convincing as the mobster boss who is the \\"mark\\".  It is a compelling film that will entertain you.  The ending is classic and perfect-just like the rest of the movie.  It is not surprising that it won \\"Best Picture\\" Oscar in 1973, as well as other awards.
B002CAWNEM|2.0|In my opinion Beyonce's performance was not convincing, for example Elba's character after he was drugged and the other woman slept with him, Elba's character and Beyonce's character were arguing and Elba's character said, \\"where do you want me to go\\"? and Beyonce's character said, \\"to hell, until then go to the four seasons, take your toothbrush\\". I was like okay that didnt make sense and plus that ugly baby that was in the movie, they could have least pick a better looking child.

B002K0WBXW|1.0|Sandra Bullock is still stuck in 1995 in this uninspired romantic comedy where she goes through all the motions that the genre calls for with little originality.     Betty White makes it all worth it with her scene-stealing turn as a grandmother. She's always one to watch for.

B001FB4VZS|4.0|The future Man of Steel leaves the not-so-quaint farm life of Smallville for the busy streets of Metropolis in \\"Smallville: The Complete Eighth Season\\". While not working on his desk on the Daily Planet or forging a special relationship with Lois Lane (Erica Durance), Clark Kent (Tom Welling) swoops to the recue as the helpful hero known as the Red-Blue Blur. Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman), the new CEO of LuthorCorp, searches for the missing Lex Luthor. The relationship between Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore) is threatened by the mysterious David Bloome (Sam Witwer) who struggles more and more to control the unstoppable beast within him. If you've been following the series, you'll know that it has many ups and downs but overall the eighth season proves to be more entertaining than the previous one. After the departures of cast regulars Kristin Kreuk and Michael Rosenbaum, there was some concern if the series would hold up in this season. There are some interesting episodes and appearances of familiar DC Comics characters. The season-long story builds up nicely but the big climatic finish was somewhat ineffective.<br /><br />Any fan of \\"Smallville\\" will surely want to pick up their copy of \\"Smallville: The Complete Eighth Season\\". All 22 episodes of the eighth season are presented in a 1.78:1 anamorphic wide screen format. The picture quality is well defined with nice bright colors. Its 5.1 Dolby Digital audio is surprisingly dynamic. The menu screens look great. The 6-disc box set includes audio commentary tracks by series producers, writers and cast member Cassidy Freeman on two episodes (Identity & Legion), deleted scenes and two behind-the-scenes featurettes (In The Director's Chair: Behind the Lens and Calling the Shots with Allison Mack & Smallville's Doomsday: The Making of a Monster). Overall, \\"Smallville: The Complete Eighth Season\\" scores a \\"B\\".

0307473465|4.0|Due to the popular movie starring Kate Winslet, most readers are familiar with The Reader's plot.  The movie differs slightly from the book, but the small adaptations remain true to the story.<br /><br />The Reader is powerful book that is written simply in first person narrative.  I never thought that I would consider the humanity of a holocaust perpetrator.  Schlink makes the reader empathize with the former camp guard while regarding at her actions honestly. Excellent read - I would recommend this for college course reading as the subject matter is mature.
B002AT4K9G|4.0|I didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did but I gotta admit- I really enjoyed it!  Vin Diesel looked great!  Paul Walker looked OLD!  The cars were cool, the races suspenseful, the girls were superficial, the cops were really DUMB and the story was okay.  Put it all together, and somehow this film was fun.  I watched this with my teenage daughter and she loved it too- even the goofy parts that made no sense, even when we solved the case before the cops did.  This is why you watch this film: Vin's muscles, the shiny cars, the pulsing synthesizer house music, the bubble boobed mini-skirted chicks, the ridiculous story- we were hypnotized.  Just sit back, relax and have fun.
B000286RKW|5.0|As far back as Henry Hill can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster. His dreams are realized early on in his childhood as he ascends the ranks of the mafia in Brooklyn, NY and then finds his life descending into a downward spiral that forces him out of society altogether. This is his true story, adapted from a novel by Nicholas Pileggi and brought to the screen by writer/director Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />Authenticity plays a big role in the film. Because it is a true story about real people, it would be nothing if the characters didn't feel authentic. Thankfully we have the great Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (who subsequently won an Oscar for his role) along with Ray Liotta (in, no doubt, his finest role) bringing the players in the film to life so naturally. Nothing these actors do is over-done nor glamorized in any way. In fact, it's almost as if the trio personally knew the people they were portraying before committing their interpretations to film. For all of their character flaws and ugliness, nothing is sugar-coated, and the film is the better for it. Of course, it helps with a solid supporting cast that includes Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Frank Sivero. Bracco, in particular, gives the viewer someone to live through the experience with, as she witnesses and comes to term with the shocking reality she must adapt to.<br /><br />The film is no doubt violent and brutal, but is delivered with a touch of class as only Martin Scorsese can bring to the game. This film alone is a testament to his status as one of America's finest film-makers. Conjuring up images that will stay with you long after your first viewing, Scorsese makes the ultra-violence as real as it should be and brings only the finest performances out of even the smallest players in the pack. Helping to commit the film to memory is a brilliant soundtrack of popular tunes that spans three decades and serves as a stunning example of popular music used effectively in cinema. If you remember one thing about \\"Goodfellas,\\" it may very well be Eric Clapton's \\"Layla\\" and the grisly and haunting images that accompany it.<br /><br />Without a doubt, \\"Goodfellas\\" is one of the finest mob films ever made and, at the very least, is certainly one of Scorsese's best. From the cast to the music and everything in between, it is complete, sweet and sensational perfection. View it, and you'll see why it was such a smashing success and why it is still considered a classic almost 20 years later.t \\"Goodfellas,\\" it may very well be Eric Clapton's \\"Layla\\" and the grisly and haunting images that accompany it.

B00007ELEL|4.0|I just now recently watched this film, and I can't believe I waited this long to finally see it. This is a really good film..very funny..and in my opinion, the best Coen Brothers film..(though there's still a couple I haven't seen yet!) The basic plot that jump starts the film is kinda silly, but its so silly its great..then the story just evolves from there..from things getting bad to worse for \\"The Dude\\" and his friends! The performance of Jeff Bridges as this \\"dude\\" is classic. And don't forget John Goodman as the dude's bowling friend and sidekick, Walter. As with most Coen brother's work..the dialogue is hilarious and fantastic..especially the interacting of Bridges' and Goodman's characters. I just can't believe that I've missed out on this film for this long! Definitely recommended to anyone that enjoys funny dialogue and unforgettable characters!!
0446677450|3.0|If you're looking for a quick-start and easy-read that briefs you on the basics of financial ideology, this book is a great read. Authors Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon L. Lechter take a look at the differing ideas about money.<br /><br />Kiyosaki starts his story thus: \\"I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one ...\\" and, growing up in the shadows of these two influential men, Kiyosaki asked himself the question: what ideas about money separate the poor-, middle- and upper classes?<br />His book aims to communicate how you, the reader, can put yourself on the \\"right\\" side of riches by adopting an effective way of thinking about money.<br /><br />Kiyosaki first identifies and demasks the \\"employee mentality\\". According to him, a middle-class view of the world involves a heavy focus on traditional education (i.e. no real focus on financial management), which culminates in a professional job and a mortgage on a principal residence. Rather than buy cash-producing assets, argues Kiyosaki, the middle classes instead buy cash-eating liabilities, that - to top it off - with after-tax dollars.<br />Thus, most middle class families consider their house to be their principal asset, although the property generates no revenue, eating property taxes and utilities bills all the way.<br /><br />Kiyosaki's recommendation - if you want to get out of the rat race of \\"work\\" and have a chance at being rich - Make sure you invest, and that you invest in revenue generating assets !<br /><br />Although the book is a little thin on the nuts and bolts of how to produce wealth, Kiyosaki does effectively and quickly outline how differing attitudes to money end up conditioning our work- and financial lives. As you read, you'll find yourself saying \\"Hey - yes, this is exactly how some people think...\\"<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to all the disgruntled employees out there, as well as to anyone who is interested in getting out of the rat race !!
B0015XHQTE|5.0|This is a great box set. I would have paid double for it. The overall quality is great, and it comes with many collectables that are very interesting. The movies look and sound great too. Any Clint Eastwood fan should own this.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|WOW! The remastering is incredible. The track choices flawless, (though I may have included \\"Handle With Care\\" for sure, plus \\"Taxman\\", \\"It's All Too Much\\", and/or \\"I Need You\\"). Nice job including \\"This Is Love\\", one of my top-5 George tracks of all time. \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" will always be #1 for me, a live version is included here.<br /><br />The booklet is well-done as well. The liner notes, and especially the close-ups of the guitar and mixing board are some of the coolest still-life photos I've seen.<br /><br />Great package that delivers the familiar tracks, some nuggets that were somewhat difficult to score (Cheer Down), and some live versions, all sounding pristne through super remastering.<br /><br />To go deeper, score LIVE IN JAPAN, All Things Must Pass, Cloud Nine, Traveling Wilburys Vol.1, and The Concert For George DVD.
B001GM28HO|1.0|Absolutely unbearable and unlistenable. I'm pretty open minded when it comes to mindless pop music. Heck, Britney's Blackout is a HUGE guilty pleasure for me. I can totally dig Peaches dirty lyrics and amatuerish lo-fi beats. But Lady Gaga is just plain bad. Think of the worst gay house music that you would hear at your local dance club, you know the type. Well, Gaga takes that annoying style and amps it up to 11. Unbearable. Unlistenable.  I deleted this from my mp3 player and sold the disc. Really? People are digging this? What makes it even worse is she's totally full of herself with an ego larger than the planet Pluto. I read an interview in either V or W magazine where she goes on and on about how she was wearing Thierry Mugler long before Beyonce!? WTF? Well honey, at least Beyonce has a modicum of talent to back up her fashion choices. Please tell me that her 15 minutes are almost up.

Artwork for the packaging of the CD and DVD was designed by renowned street pop artist \\"Mr. Brainwash.\\"    I know fans will be disappointed by the missing videos (and I am sure there are plenty more missing ones that I am ignoring), but 1) consider that it is a 2-disc 180 minute collection of 47 (!)

All in all, I'd say this is a very solid collection for Madonna fans and fans of the music video medium.
0439023483|5.0|What an awesome book. It's been a while since I've read a book that I lost sleep over. I couldn't put this book down. The way Suzanne Collins wrote just kept you in suspense. There was no time to dawdle just read, read, read.<br />It is set in the future in the US. The earth was nearly destroyed. The US was rebuilt into districts plus a capitol. It started off with 13 districts but they went together and rebelled against the capitol. The capitol won and district 13 was totally destroyed. So now there are 12 districts that live in fear of the capitol. Each district supplies the capitol with what it needs. One way the capitol keeps everyone in line is by having the Hunger Games. This is a game were a boy and a girl from each district between the ages of 12-18 is put in a arena and made to battle each other until there is only one living child left. That child is the victor and their district is supplemented a little better.<br />The book starts off in District 12 where the supply there is coal. There are many mining accidents and people often starve to death. There we also meet Katniss. She has learned to survive after her father died in a mining accident and her mother went into a great depression. She had to survive because the only person she truly loved was her little sister Prim and if Katniss didn't bring food to the table, it is possible no one would.<br />The day of the Reaping comes. This is where names are drawn from the districts on who would go fight. It turns out to be Katniss's sister Prim for the girl. Katniss has to protect her. How??? Read the book to find out!<br />I know some people are sensitive to children killing children and if you are one of those, you shouldn't read this book. The book did remind me a little of the Running Man and Lord of the Flies but I felt this story held it's own. I highly recommend this book.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is definitely without a doubt the best book I have ever read. In my opinion it is better than the Twilight series and right up there with Harry Potter. If you're thinking about getting this book, GET IT!!! I am a 13 year old girl writing this review under my mom's account, and I learned about this book when one of my teachers read it to us during class. The whole class was crazy about the book, begging the teacher to read just a few more pages because at every end of the chapter the author left you hanging. After we had finished reading it I went ahead and bought it because it was one of my favorites and I wanted to have a copy of my own. I even made my mom read it because I loved it so much and she loved it as well. GREAT for all ages and BOTH genders. It's hard to say what genre it is since it includes action, adventure, romance, violence, suspense, and more. Makes a great gift. I can't wait to read the 2nd and 3rd book!
B001SMC91M|4.0|There is a British legend that King Arthur (he of the Round Table) is sleeping underground until he wakes to deal with the greatest crisis that will ever threaten the island of Britain.     Similarly we've always known that in a dark cave somewhere, possibly in the Catskills or even the Appalachians, the Legendary Blues Brothers have been hibernating, ready to be revived in a time of need.     That time is clearly now, because Black Joe Lewis and his Honeybears' latest CD is plainly Jake and Elwood brought back to life, dusted down for the twenty first century and brought blazing back into the limelight. Minus all the \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" nonsense of course, and with added \\"parenteral advisory lyrics\\".     All this is by way of a compliment. Terrific good time hard-driving, brass-heavy blues music. Great fun and well worth buying.

B00263J69K|4.0|While not quite as breathtaking as Pillars of the Earth, World Without End is another great epic that takes place in proverbial Kingsbridge two centuries after Prior Phillip's time.  The plot contains some familiar aspects: an elaborate building project (this time, a bridge), a declining fleece trade, and the conspiracies of the reigning monarch.  There are also some characters that resemble their ancestors: Merthin, a descendant of Jack Builder who aspires to be the greatest builder in England, his brother Ralph, an ambitious yet cruel knight seeking glory, and Merthin's long time love Caris, a stubborn yet successful woman who is at odds with tradition.<br /><br />However, there are some aspects of the book that were a bit tedious.  This time around, the prior, first Godwyn, then his sycophant Philemon, is a scheming unsympathetic worm whose conflicts with the village are nothing but frustrating.  Even Caris's pride is exasperating at times: she knows she loves Merthin and wants to be with him, but detests the convention of being a subservient wife.  While Ralph wasn't quite as loathsome a villain as William Hamleigh, he lacked the depth that made me want to utterly despise him.<br /><br />What did work well was the depiction of the plague that wiped out half of England's population during this period.  Follett incorporates its affects on families, commerce, farming and faith effectively.  The evolution of medical thinking at this time is another paramount feature, as religious superstition had to take a backseat to the practicalities of dealing with such a devastating illness.  Like Pillars, the scope of this novel is vast, with so many characters who are believably fallible, and multiple plot lines that encompass the variety of the human condition.  Spanning decades, it progresses smoothly and its historical accuracy is commendable.  While I didn't think it was as engrossing as Pillars, it still delivered what I was looking for in a quality historical fiction novel.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|My god what an insanely overrated movie! These positive reviews are more amusing than the actual movie itself. I wont hesitate to say that I loved the first two Batman movies. I wont claim that they are flawless(no superhero movie is) but they were fun and when I have a ball watching a movie I'm willing to look past its flaws. The Joel Shumacher movies made me roll my eyes but later on those movies became a guilty pleasure because their bizarre awfulness lends a certain charm to them(In a what-the-hell-was-Joel-thinking way). I didnt know of Batman Begins existence until a friend mentioned it in 2007. I saw it for free and fell in love with it instantly. Nobody at the job that I had mentioned it, nobody I knew mentioned it and I dont really watch TV so I would have never seen a trailer for it. Since then I have the DVD and have seen it six times about to be seven. This movie on the other hand.... I had a feeling this movie would fall short of Batman Begins but I didnt think it was going to be this bad. This movie should have been called Jokers Wild because it was more about The Joker than Batman. Batman seemed to be an afterthought in his own movie.<br /><br />TDK doenst have much of a plot except for The Joker(Heath Ledger) causing mayhem in Gotham and Batman(Christian Bale) and Commissioner Gordon(Gary Oldman) team up with the Gotham police force to stop him. Christian Bale is boring as both Batman and Bruce Wayne and that voice... Does he really think he sounds menacing? He sounds like Nick Nolte doing a really bad impression of Tone Loc. He spends the majority of this movie with an unintelligible look on his face that screams hangover. A huge change from the phenomenal Batman/Bruce Wayne that he played previously in Batman Begins.<br /><br />Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman(who all did well previously in Batman Begins) sleepwalk through THE ENTIRE MOVIE! Aaron Eckhardt is bland as both Harvey Dent and Two-Face. His Two-Face is a level higher than Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face but only by default(which is nothing to brag about really). Maggie Gyllenhaal is weak as Rachel Dawes, playing her like some high school girl swooning over Bruce Wayne. Arguably she has done better work in the past but her Rachel Dawes comes across as a silly little girl in dire need of better priorities. Totally different from the Rachel Dawes of Batman Begins. Heath Ledger is not bad as The Joker but he did not deserve the obscene amount of hype he got. His character was a one-dimensional nut job who when he is not killing people he is foolishly philosophizing like some stupid emo-goth freak(I was ready for him to start talking about the misery of human existence while going through a pack of smokes). This Joker has no back story, rarely smiles or laughs and is predictable to a fault. So how exactly is he better than Jack Nicholson's Joker? In Burton's movie, The Joker had a back story. He was more than some wacko killer and you knew from the beginning that he is going to do his crimes with style. He is a tad goofy but unpredictable. He is fun to watch. In TDK he has no style or surprises. He just kills people and he is not having any fun doing it. YAWN!<br /><br />Flaws, contradictions and just plain plot holes in The Dark Knight:<br /><br />*Too many meaningless subplots that never connect<br /><br />*People get punched, kicked, bitten by dogs and knocked around by explosions and walk away without cuts, bruises, bumps or blood<br /><br />*Does Bruce love Rachel Dawes or not?<br /><br />*Batman is an expert in Martial Arts but is knocked on his rear end easily by The Joker<br /><br />*A convict carrying a bomb in his stomach without setting off the metal detectors or dying from the surgery<br /><br />* A guy carries a gun with him to court(without setting off any metal detectors) in order to shoot Harvey Dent(can't a modicum of reality seep into the story? Sheesh!)<br /><br />*The sonar imaging using 30 million mobile phones in Gotham is the biggest WTF moment in movie history. This scene not only taxes the credibility of the story being told, it also contradicts the reality that Christopher Nolan was trying to produce throughout the film. Do the people that fawn over this movie realize that?<br /><br />* Too lengthy for its own good and at the same time not lengthy enough for the amount of material in it. There was too much going on in this movie but not enough time was dedicated to each part.<br /><br />* The trip to Hong Kong to nab some non sequitur character was just pointless. He wouldnt be missed if that scene was cut.<br /><br />* The whole mob subplot was completely superfluous and should have been cut.<br /><br />* What happens after the Joker crashes the party? This is one of the many scenes that just ends and leaves you uncertain about what happens afterward.<br /><br />* The Joker explaining to Harvey that he didnt kill Rachel when we all know he did<br /><br />* Harvey taking him into consideration<br /><br />* Where are the scenes that show Bruce Wayne wanting to quit being Batman and live a normal life?<br /><br />*Why does he feel that Harvey Dent should be his successor?<br /><br />* Why call him the Dark Knight when he is willing to throw in the towel so easily?<br /><br />*How does Harvey know about Batman wanting to quit being Batman someday?<br /><br />*How does Commissioner Gordon know about why Batman does what he does at the end of the movie?<br /><br />* The weirdo on TV that claims he knows who Batman really is<br /><br />* What were the main characters of TDK up to at the climax of the movie?<br /><br />* The climax was not built from the narrative. It was invented. Even the ending of this movie seemed tacked on.<br /><br />*Nobody notices thousands of gallons of flammable liquid in the engine rooms on the ferry boats?<br /><br />*How did The Joker wire the largest hospital in Gotham with explosives without nobody noticing? Take as long as you like figuring that one out. Grab a snickers while you're at it.<br /><br />*The whole hospital is evacuated except for Harvey Dent.<br /><br />*SWAT protecting a high profile criminal with police all around but The Joker comes around in a trailer truck and they all become bumbling idiots unable to protect the person they are transporting.<br /><br />* Batman going by Commissioner Gordon's house to see his family served no purpose since the audience knows that Gordon is only faking his death to lure the Joker out.<br /><br />*Commissioner Gordon's faking his death scheme doesnt work. He would have had to know what street The Joker was going to shoot him at and where the shot was going to be fired in order to jump in front of the bullet.<br /><br />* The Joker's henchman are made of the psychos and schizos from Arkham Asylum. The fact that they are competent and obedient puts a bigger strain on the credibility of the story being told.<br /><br />*The Joker dressing up as a nurse in an EVACUATED hospital(I know what your response is going to be).<br /><br />*Even if some of the hospital staff didnt leave right away who could The Joker possibly fool looking the way he does?<br /><br />I could go on but this review would be a lot longer than it needs to be. Such obvious mistakes kill the claims that this is the greatest superhero movie of all time. Batman Begins had its flaws but still managed to be a great movie. This movie has none of what made Batman Begins entertaining and interesting. It is a colossal bore that really believes its a moral compass but all the pseudo-philosophical and pseudo-intellectual rambling end up with somebody getting punched or shot. I could have easily looked past its over the top obvious flaws if it was fun but its not. This movie ruined Batman for me and made me lower my stance on movies that I panned before. Dont get me wrong. A bad movie is still a bad movie but if it offers you some form of relief(in the form of unintentional laughter) then its a lot better than this dull pompous spectacle. You know a movie is bad when it makes you reflect on previous movies that you bashed in hopes of seeing if you were fair in your judgment. TDK was written by a writer that gave us such gems as Nick Fury Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Blade Trinity and Death Warrant(a movie about a killer that wouldnt die) and a director that has given us much better work previously. The action sequences suck(a bunch of annoying quick cuts shots and 360 degree camera angles like this was some Michael Bay flick), the dialogue is a joke and story is convoluted to a fault. Now I know that this review will get 300 unhelpful votes and lots of vitriolic comments. Go ahead Im not going to respond to you or read your comments but feel free to vent all you like. I wouldnt want to deprive you of the only thing you have left in this world: your pride. As for the people that didnt fall for the hype(not just for this movie but any movie) continue being who you are and would somebody PLEASE tap the emperor on the shoulder and tell him he is wearing no clothes!

Everyone told them it was no longer available and they were quite disappointed (they had worn out their VHS copy).

B0012DZ356|5.0|I've given this book the highest rating because it's a wonderful book, and don't wish to lower its average rating.  I have little to add to the praise of other reviewers.    It should be noted, however, that there is a serious flaw in the Kindle edition of the book.  The white space that Munro uses to create section breaks within each story is missing.  Where there should be a bit of white space to give you a visual clue to something like a change of scene, there is only an ordinary paragraph break.      This is an appalling thing to do to an author as careful as Alice Munro.  I suggest you avoid defective texts of this sort.
0060512806|5.0|Cryptonomicon is a boys own ripping tale for nerds. Beloved of math geeks, and fantasy hard guys, this tells the multigenerational story of the do-something Shafetoes (USMC) and the Waterhouses (math geeks) and the practical engineers between them (the Japanese mining family the Goto Dengos) as their stories intertwine at the dawn of the internet and WWII.<br /><br />But it isn't Michener telling a tale of the rise of a segment of civilization (although Seattle's transition from a mining and timber town to a technology metropolis is explored...as is the tattered history of the Philippines).<br /><br />But the backdrop always returns to cryptology and the algorithms behind it and information theory. Historical figures both great (Turning) and small (Goring) make walk on appearances which keeps the narrative grounded in plausible history while also allowing for fantastic asides (erotic fixations, bizarre sub-cultures, inept secret societies, U-boats, the horrors of \\"the bends).<br /><br />Stephenson's style is breezy and compelling, he never lets the math bog you down nor the characters he pushes around get too wooden, and so even with its incredible length this is a readable tale. A five page ode to the correct way to eat Captain Crunch cereal is the finest prose passage on the quintessence of eating since \\"How to Cook a Wolf.\\"<br /><br />Now, if you can find the factor of two prime numbers encrypted in the above three paragraphs, then this book is for you. If you don't know what I just wrote, don't bother. If this review made you smile, you'll like Stephenson's prose.
B001GJOL22|5.0|From the opening scenes I knew I was in for a treat.  Of course the music is great, it is Rush after all.  What this DVD has that makes it a top pick is a killer set list, and a director who uses the cameras to deliver a truly enjoyable experience for the viewer.  There are no nutty camera angles, or images so jittery you feel sick, as so many live concerts seem to be shot now.  This show only falls into the number 2 slot of Rush shows due to the energy from the fans at Rush in Rio.  The sound and images are better, but Rush in Rio was a magical event.
B0021L8US0|4.0|While the South African film industry hasn't exactly achieved the international prominence of those of more prolific nations such as the U.S, the U.K., and Japan, Neill Blomkamp's political allegory/action thriller District 9 seems poised to get the country at least a taste of cinematic notoriety.  It's certainly safe to say that those accustomed to American action films will have seen few (if any) movies quite like it.  District 9 is practically an indie action movie, relying as much on story and ideas as on set pieces and effects, but that's not at all to say that it can't bring the destruction when necessary.  It rides its ingenious premise, accomplished and distinctive visuals, and the impressively naturalistic performance of the completely unknown Sharlto Copley to an all-hell-breaks-loose conclusion that easily ranks among the most memorable of recent years.  If you've grown bored with mainstream cinema of late, this movie could well hit you like a shot of adrenalin jammed Pulp Fiction-style into your heart.<br /><br />Since much of the movie relies on surprise it's tough to talk about the plot without giving away too much, but viewers with even a cursory knowledge of the history of Apartheid in South Africa will recognize the central allegory pretty quickly.  Taking place in the modern day, the film shows a South Africa that's partly populated by a race of insectoid aliens known as Prawns, whose bedraggled, malnourished remnant arrived over Johannesburg twenty years earlier.  As the faux-documentary footage in the beginning illustrates, the arrival of the Prawns has turned greater Johannesburg into a landscape of strictly enforced segregation, massive economic disparity, and barely-disguised bigotry (interestingly, from both black and white South Africans).  The allegory is hammered home in the opening scenes with all the subtlety of a Michael Bay movie, but that doesn't prevent it from having a few moments of cleverness, and it's actually handled pretty tastefully as the plot progresses.  The parallels the movie is making to racism in general and apartheid in particular are obvious, but after the beginning they're mercifully kept just beneath the surface, adding a layer of depth to the story without overpowering it.<br /><br />Besides, once the uber-cool high-tech weaponry comes out and people start exploding, it won't matter what your politics are.  District 9 works reasonably well on a thematic and dramatic level, but it works extremely well on a tail-kicking level, serving as the kind of well-made action thriller that Hollywood rarely produces these days.  The action scenes are astonishing in their immediacy and visceral impact, and the special effects easily compete with those of far more expensive movies (suffice to say that every cent of the 30-million-dollar budget is evident on screen).  The visual genius isn't limited to the action either: the Prawns themselves are believably unpleasant looking without being too far removed from humanity, and the bodily corruption that becomes a key plot element as the film goes on is depicted with some legitimately unsettling imagery that wouldn't seem out of place in Alien (or Aliens for that matter).<br /><br />Holding it all together is the compulsively watchable work of Copley, who's pretty much asked to carry the film as hapless mid-level functionary Wikus van de Merwe, by far the most significant human character.  At the start of the movie Wikus is a genial enough sort, skating by at least partly on his marriage to the incongruously attractive daughter of the CEO of the shadowy mega-corporation he works for.  When he's tapped to oversee the relocation of the Prawn population to a new slum farther removed from humanity, the operation starts out innocently enough, but when events take a turn for the worse, they go bad very quickly and very severely.  Even as Wikus's situation becomes increasingly nightmarish, though, Copley keeps his performance grounded and relatable, giving the movie a compelling intensity even before Blomkamp ramps up the pace of the action.  If this movie had been made in the U.S. there would almost certainly have been a big-name actor in this role, and he almost certainly wouldn't have been anywhere near as good as Copley is here.<br /><br />Despite the rather fantastic plot, the movie still takes place in a world that very much resembles our own, with real-world touches ranging from the cartoonishly evil Nigerian gangsters that relentlessly profiteer in the alien territories to the brutal, ultra-racist soldiers who enforce the quasi-apartheid (presumably modeled on the real-life race police from the days of actual apartheid).  In the end District 9 is a pretty odd mix of realism, escapism, action, and emotion, but you'd be hard-pressed to deny its originality or its intelligence.  \\"Scrappy\\" is one word I've seen used to describe this movie, and I'd have a hard time coming up with a better label--it doesn't have a huge budget or big-name stars, but it keeps hammering away until there's little choice but to be caught up in its vision.  District 9 is definitely not for everyone, but those who can appreciate Blomkamp's imagination should be more than pleased.ing intensity even before Blomkamp ramps up the pace of the action.

0385342020|3.0|I was rather disappointed in this book. The story had possibilities--a young woman from Roaring 20s, who ultimately lived to be 105, comes back as a ghost at her funeral looking for her favorite necklace. However, I don't think the author quite pulls it off. Parts of the story are downright silly and had me rolling my eyes: Sadie screaming in people's ears, Lara walking all over London looking like she's talking/yelling at herself, etc. Nonetheless, I'm giving \\"Twenties Girl\\" 3 stars because I really liked Sadie, the ghost. She's the most richly drawn character. Sadie wasn't a saint--far from it!--but she changes Lara's life and helps her become a better person. As someone who has spent time volunteering with the elderly, I know that we all tend to forget that old people were once young too. So I loved the overall message of the book--that inside, despite what the mirror may tell us, we all feel like we're still in our 20s. And that Sadie, who thought she had wasted her long life and died a forgotten old lady, really had made a difference in this world. I also thought that Lara's send-off to Sadie at the end was quite moving... I don't know if she was watching, but I think Sadie would have approved.

0307269981|4.0|Larsson's second book of the Millennium Trilogy, above all else, does not disappoint. Certainly there are parts that are not enjoyable, but the novel, on its face, doesn't ever betray you or let you down. Everything in it either creates tension or relieves it. Larsson's particular style makes sure you are thinking something and you need to decide how you feel about it, knowing full well that it might turn out the other way.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is back, this time independently wealthy. The first third of the book devotes serious effort to recharacterizing her, Blomkvist, Berger, Bjurman, and all the rest. Unfortunately, I found Lisbeth's trip to Bermuda too long and describing new aspects of her personality (she allows herself to be seduced by a 16-year-old native?) without talking about the process of how she changed was poignant. She seemed removed from her old self, even though her actions in the second and third parts of the book are basically the same. The only new feeling is regret involving Miriam Wu, which is refreshing but is not emphasized. More on Blomkvist below.<br /><br />The second act focuses a lot on police procedure, and is relatively interesting. Several bright characters appear, and the concurrent investigations of Armansky, Blomkvist, and Bublanski are fun to watch overlap and expound upon one another. Larsson plays a great, but common, card of emphasizing one character then removing them from the book for a long stretch, where the reader is constantly wondering what really happened and learning about facts in a roundabout fashion. It works well for him.<br /><br />The confrontation at the warehouse seemed both exciting and off-kilter. In a way, I felt that the giant was \\"unfair\\" and that Roberto's cocky attitude let the reader take a serious look at what was being foreshadowed. Larsson really shines at the outcome.<br /><br />At times, the book appears to be sponsored by Apple and IKEA. It is strange to me, especially with the technical jargon, because if you go back and reread book one, the computers are terribly outdated and no longer impressive. Continuing to refer to their specification guarantees that, sooner than later, readers will find the archaic references humorous. I don't think it detracts from the narrative, however. I merely regard it as curious.<br /><br />Again in this book, my biggest problem is Blomkvist. Bleak and uninteresting, he is recharacterized as a blithe ladies man whose biggest problem is fame and women throwing themselves at him. Woe is he. No one is really interested in the relationship between him and Harriett. As he puts on his gumshoe hat in the second act, it looks like he actually might graduate into some kind of emotion, but again: nothing. I could see him not becoming involved in the Vanger case because he had no connection, but these events are closely tied to him and he barely reacts. At the end, Salander reveals that there is actually nothing to solve at all, and all his efforts merely confirm what she knew the whole time. It's frustrating to watch a character get so much face time but basically get ignored for another 300 pages.<br /><br />A couple other assorted issues with the book:<br /><br />1. If you're an investigative reporter, or even a grad student, about to blow the doors off a major scandal, get some folks fired and probably a few others sent to prison, it really can't be surprising that violence might ensue. You may want to consider basic protective measures. Then Blomkvist attempts to go after them armed only with a can of mace? Smart.<br /><br />2. You can't flip a page in the second act without a police officer calling Lisbeth retarded. OKAY. WE GET IT. At times the psychologist reports get mentioned once a paragraph. It's like being beaten with a fish.<br /><br />3. I guess Larsson heard that everyone thought the epilogue of the first book was too long, and decided to remove the second book's denouement as punishment. The sequel preparation to book one was obvious, but this might as well be a \\"To be continued...\\" page. Golly, I wonder who will take over Berger's spot at Millennium? I sure have heard a lot about this Camilla girl! Durrrrrr...<br /><br />Overall, I have to give the book four stars, even though it probably only deserves three.  Lisbeth is an extremely fun character, even though she can (almost) do no wrong. The rest of the cast, besides an extremely vibrant, psychotic portrayal of Bjurman, seem blurry at best, and I really wish Larsson would have finished the book rather than take the cheap route to getting me to buy book three. Doesn't mean I won't buy it immediately, though... :)page. Golly, I wonder who will take over Berger's spot at Millennium? I sure have heard a lot about this Camilla girl! Durrrrrr...

1401223176|4.0|Finally!  Previously available as two separate volumes, this is the first time all 12 monthly issues of the Loeb/Lee run have been put together, giving us the complete HUSH story.<br /><br />Jeph Loeb gives us a very good detective story.  Better is his character-study, nuanced approach to the Dark Knight, himself.  Loeb manages to bring fresh eyes to the Batman, displaying a longing and a loneliness previously unrevealed.  The scenes with Catwoman are some of the best in years.  Those with Nightwing (the original Robin) show growth and a new maturity for both characters.  And, of course, the new villain - Hush, is a great addition to the rogues gallery.<br /><br />Jim Lee's contribution is possibly even greater.  He draws some of the most iconic and visually stunning pictures of Batman, EVER.  There was Neal Adams, Norm Breyfogle, Dick Sprang, and Alex Ross.  Add to the `Top 5 Batman Artists of All Time' list - Jim Lee.  And he may have taken over the Number 1 spot, at that!  Sharp, dynamic, and nothing less than electrifying, Lee's work here is some of the greatest artwork ever done in a graphic novel or comic book.<br /><br />Ranking high on the list (just after The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One, and Batman: Absolution), HUSH instantly becomes one of the most important and character-defining Batman stories of all time.

I found the book fairly interesting since I enjoy history.  However, I have a few complaints:  the book is at least 200 pages too long; there are way too many agonizing details; and the writing was such that it was interesting but not compelling.  Sadly, this book felt like a chore to read rather than a pleasure.  That notwithstanding, it was definitely a quality academic work that hit all the high and low points of the subject.  \\"Team of Rivals\\" is worthwhile for history buffs, but the average reader may want to steer clear.

1594202249|4.0|Whenever Pynchon releases a book, it's an event to be relished. Readers will find this an easier go than AGAINST THE DAY, and in fact, it somewhat picks up where LOT 49 left off. It is certainly a more linear story than DAY or even Mason/Dixon, which in its own way was a sort of 18th Century Gravity's Rainbow. I'll need to get back to DAY as I found it a real slog on the first go. IV is encouraging me to do just that.  Anyway, here, Pynchon evokes Hammett and Chandler, Bogart and Nicholson, Carlin and Zonker Harris in a story that, as the New York Times put it, chronicles the dissolution of the Summer of Love into the Autumn of Authority. As ever, Pynchon's focus, even blurry-eyed and stoned, is on the dissolution of human freedom under the gravity of authority, convention, neuroses and Time. He details the negative dialectic in a very often tragic/comic struggle of simple humans, the dark and disturbing nightmare of Hegel's trajectory of the Absolute Spirit in a sort of Columbia space shuttle burnout under the arc of entropy. This go 'round, as Doc Sportello, like so many anti-heroes before him in the canon of Pynchon, is coming to grips with the fact that he is waking up from the kind of stupor that has allowed him to ensnare himself. On the case of missing girlfriends, real estate developers, sax players from surf bands, and a lifestyle that has rapidly jettisoned all and every from the beach to skid row, Doc deals with those market and authoritative forces that have already written not just the history but the ending. I am reminded of Oscar Wilde's comment that \\"Every great man nowadays has his disciples, but it always Judas who writes the biography.\\"  In the course of Pynchon's oeuvre, a corrupted and corrosive Invisible Hand is giving man the finger, and regardless of the passions at work, the havoc industrialized, still the human spirit is left with small epiphanies and tiney graces to mollify his downward fall. If, like Tyrone Slothrop, one flies too high togravitational rainbow, one can also effect one's release, but the rest of us lose track.  Doc is trying like hell to keep track of customers, old flames, his Kools and his pot, and whatever happened to the promise of his life.  This is a page turner. Much like any noir story, there are no redemptions, only survivors. It all begins again. At the end of the book, you'll find yourself hoping that there will be another book from Pynchon soon. He's in his 70's now. I'd love to find out what happened to Tyrone....
B000VEQISS|5.0|Rebecca.  Where to start.  Rebecca is the late wife of Maxim de Winter and takes place for the most part on the Manderlay estate.  The readers only meet Rebecca through the eyes of the characters.  The story is masterfully told.  Mr. de Winter takes another wife and brings her to Manderlay and because of all that the second Mrs. de Winter hears and sees and for that matter doesn't hear she is left to speculate her own purpose and existance in the shadow of the late Mrs. de Winter.  The story builds slowly and steadily, and by the time you get wrapped into the story you are in so deep you just HAVE to finish it.<br /><br />Breathtaking prose.  Great book.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|I mean it really is, there's nothing else you can say. Am I right? I mean, am I right on this one? Is this movie a joke or what? Forget about the fact that the Yanks weren't even in the war yet, and forget about the fact that duh seven men cannot operate a submarine, and oh yeah forget about the sub (pun intended) par acting, and don't forget to forget about the fact that for real every single thing about this movie is fake, forget about all of that and just think about this for a sec: they did all of that in the old sub and then without confirming any kind of rendezvous with a friendly vessel they abandon ship into the open sea. Can you please forget about all that other stuff and just explain that to me for a quick sec?
B000BEZQ18|5.0|After purchasing the DVD of Brokeback Mountain and reading the book, I purchased my first CD of the movie track.  (This is my second purchase of the same CD.) The collection of artists and music is rich.  The instrumental guitar work is compelling and crisp.  This was my first encounter with Teddy Thompson and Rufus Wainwright--hard to \\"box in\\" musicians from musical families--a whole new horizon.  The lyrics on the lesser known songs are compelling and profound aside from one's take on the film theme.  The only song I would jetizon is Steve Erle's \\"The Devil's Right Hand,\\" although the concept commands one's attention.  Unfortunately, I think this CD is a \\"sleeper,\\" but it should be a \\"keeper.\\"
B002BVXYRM|5.0|First off let me say I am a KID A fan.  I open my CD collection and Kid A is the only CD that calls out to me 'play me, play me'  Yes sick I know but very typical of a Radiohead addict..  I spent $23 on this collectors edition.  You get Kid A which is always a plus BUT you get a CD with live cuts and let me just say, this CD is worth the price many times over.      Best cut on the CD for me is Everything In Its Right Place where Thom Yorke's vocals go off sounding like an instrument with static.  He does a great job with this song.  It was recorded at the Canal Studios along with other great recordings, Morning Bell(with acoustic guitar - Ahhh!), The National Anthem, How To Disappear Completely (fantastic recording), In Limbo, Idioteque, and Motion Picture Soundtrack (always a favorite).  These are all live and they blew my head away.    The Second CD also features recordings from BBC Radio One, Everything In Its Right Place, How To Disappear Completely, Idioteque and the National Anthem all quite crystal clear with a different take on the songs. Optimistic was recorded live in Victoria Park and the last cut on the cd is True Love Waits a live version.    If you are a Kid A fan this is a must have for you as some of these recordings of these songs are better than what is on the cd in my opinion but I also guarantee you will not be disappointed!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is one of the best shows on t.v.!  It's imaginative and very addicting.  I love ERIC!  I've read all 9 books and can't wait to see every season!  Of course Eric doesn't really come in until season 2 but you gotta watch season 1 to catch up!  Or read the books by Charlaine Harris, they are addicting and you will totally fall in love with the characters!
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) is suppose to be in charge of his convinence store, but life seems kind of harsh for him and his friend video-store clerk Randall (Jeff Anderson). Dante's girlfriend Veronica (Marylin Ghigliotti) has been fighting with him and wants to get back to old girlfriend Caitlyn Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer) as the two fellows seem to be harsh to their costumers and seem to be goofing off.<br /><br />Brilliant independent cult comedy which marked the debut of writer-director-actor Kevin Smith is one of the 90's best and original comedies. Here this movie gives us original characters that no one will forget including the live-action equalant to Beavis and Butt-Head known as Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) and Jay (Jason Mews) who are badass stoner characters. I love how the clerks in this movie are speaking to each other about movies including on which Star Wars is better and how they goof around when they are suppose to work. The film is very funny but it does contain very vulger language that aren't for virgin ears but however this comedy surely isn't for everyone.<br /><br />This 3-Disc special edition DVD includes both theatrical and extended unrated cut with loads of extras like audio commentaries, lost scene, MTV spots with Silent Bob and Jay, Music Video, featurettes, documentary, Q and A feature, Photo Gallery, articles and reviews, 1993 Program Note replica, DVD-Rom, and more.
B002E01LL6|2.0|Movies about the shady world of underground fighting and gambling have been done to death; director/writer Dito Montiel's \\"FIGHTING\\" is another entry into this overused genre. Ok, so what made me sit through this film? Well, I am a sucker for fight sequences and I do believe that such a stereotypical movie can shine when the fight scenes themselves take center stage. Channing Tatum may not be the best actor for the role and admittedly the man isn't known for his acting skills, but he does 'look' the role of the underdog; that, combined with the fact that Montiel brings a lively feel and look of a contemporary New York City--oh, I also like watching fight scenes.<br /><br />Shawn McArthur (Channing Tatum) hails from Birmingham, Alabama who comes to the Big Apple to make a living selling bootleg books, CDs and DVDs. Shawn is desperate to make a big score and when he crosses paths with a more experienced hustler in the person of Harvey Broaden (Terrence Howard) after a fight with his associates, Shawn gets recruited to participate in bare knuckle fights for some major money. Somewhere along the way, Shawn meets up with Evan Hailey (Brian White); a man from his past who supposedly trained with him in his father's wrestling school. Shawn is determined to make the big score; whatever it takes...<br /><br />The film's premise is undoubtedly unimaginative and completely routine. While Montiel does bring try to bring a lively atmosphere in this world of shady characters composed of hustlers, gamblers and underground fighters in New York's shadowy corners, he has so little cards in his hands. Sure, he does bring the sights of New York in the composition as with \\"Saints\\", but the characters in this film are pretty stereotypical and feel like mere caricatures of what they may (should) have been. It is full of shady, intimidating dark figures that are in it for greed and angry heroes with issues complete with `macho-posturing'. It borrows heavily from elements established by \\"Lionheart\\" and the 1975 classic \\"Hard Times\\".<br /><br />Montiel attempts to bring the relationship between Harvey and Shawn into bear but he is severely hampered by the screenplay that offers little to no surprises. The problem is that the film telegraphs its punches way too soon, and it misses several opportunities; the subplot with Shawn's father is never given any room to develop and the rivalry between Evan and Shawn isn't fully utilized--they felt like they were just using the usual practices of machismo. The only good character that adds some twist is in the person of Zulay (Zulay Henao) who plays Shawn's love interest. The script tries to promote a moody, realistic and seedy feel, and while it does on some level, it just couldn't capitalize on what its got.<br /><br />Ok, so this film isn't going to win any Oscars, but a film like this can stay aloft when the fights are brutal and fresh. Well, Montiel does give the fights a somewhat realistic feel, they are messy and in this unrated cut, a bit more violent and longer (with 2 minutes of added footage). They are shot in a manner that keeps the action close, playing on the facial expressions of the fighters to express emotion. Some of the fights did manage to provoke my interest, as they became harder with more seasoned opponents but I thought the movie could've used more fights to serve in its build up and to invest on Shawn's reputation in the fighting arena. Also, I thought Shawn's fight with the Asian fighter was the best one. Still, being an action junkie, I have seen a lot of superb fight scenes; beautifully choreographed as well as simple realistic ones--the fights in \\"Fighting\\" offers nothing fresh and are just OK. But for a film that should focus on the brutal encounters, \\"OK\\" just doesn't cut it. It left me nothing to look forward to, and I could just predict on how everything would turn out.<br /><br />The acting is a mixed bag. Tatum is a good-looking actor, (or so my lady friends say) but his skillsas a performer is mediocre at best. There is a subway training scene that gives his character some intensity but we've all seen it better. The chemistry between Howard and Tatum feels forced as all it seemed that the two shared are stares and a contest of who gets to mumble more effectively. Zulay Henao (I love that first name) is charming and very attractive; her love scenes with Tatum are filled with the usual `holding hands' during love making. The idea of the twist as to what her relationship with Harvey had promise but it made no impact on its narrative. Evan Hailey (played by White) felt too averaged as the main antagonist and acts more like a high school bully than a fighter with a fearsome record.<br /><br />\\"Fighting\\" should have been grittier and more violent to achieve the character's depth as an underdog and for the hero's fortitude to be felt. The film's screenplay tries but never quite reaches its goal because of its weak script; you can just feel that it went on its journey but it never reached its destination. \\"Fighting\\" is just a bare-knuckled flick that would not inflict damage to other films in this genre. Overall, \\"Fighting\\" is a just a mediocre urban melodrama.<br /><br />Rent it! [2 Stars]ere is a subway training scene that gives his character some intensity but we've all seen it better.

0439023483|5.0|In the future North America has vanished and a new nation called Panem has risen. Twelve districts are ruled by the Capitol, a tyrant ruling council that uses a yearly competition to keep order among its despondent citizens. Every year one boy and one girl from each district are chosen to compete in the Hunger Games where they must fight to the death. The location is always different, and every year the nation watches with bated breath to see who will be the last one standing.     In District 12, Katniss Everdeen looks on in horror as her younger sister is chosen to compete in this year's games. Before she knows it she finds herself volunteering in her sister's place. Also chosen is the mysterious baker's son, Peeta, who Katniss has always known from a distance. As the competition nears Katniss and Peeta grow closer making the imminent battle for survival all the more complicated. This year Katniss and Peeta will capture the hearts of a hopeless nation as they turn the tables on The Hunger Games and the evil Capitol that controls them.     I am always on the lookout for that one story. You know what I mean. The one that gets in your head and won't go away. The kind of book you want to put in everyone's hands.  A story that has the power to completely mesmerize and capture your imagination. The Hunger Games has done all of that for me and more.    Collins hooks us from line one with the engaging first person narrative of Katniss Everdeen. Through her eyes we learn about this world in the distant future and the turmoil within. This is the kind of character that most novelists only dream of creating. Every turn of the page reveals just a little more about what drives her unquenchable spirit. Katniss may be low on the social ladder, but her compassion and fight for justice lend a majestic quality to this lowly peasant.     If Katniss herself doesn't hook you, no doubt the relentless pacing will. Once the Games begin it is almost impossible to put this story down. Collins perfectly balances action, suspense, and violence throughout the second half of this story. As I was reading I felt like I, too, was watching these Games unfold along with the citizens of Panem and several times I wanted to stand and cheer for Katniss and Peeta and their heroic actions. In the end we are given the perfect amount of closure with a promise of more to come.     The Hunger Games might just be the best novel I've read this year and I am simply blown away by the storytelling prowess of Suzanne Collins. The sequel, Catching Fire, is due out soon and if early reviews are any indication, round two is even better. I can't wait to disappear once more into this fascinating world that has captured my imagination in a way I never anticipated.
0143038583|5.0|This book was great.  Michael Pollan's humor came through so well.  You can picture almost everything he is doing.  Many times my roommates gave me weird looks as I would be cracking up in the corner over the section on mushroom picking or pig hunting.  A really great book, great read. Plus a good deal of useful information, I learned a lot about the path of our food.    MUCH better than the botany or desire.
B002DKGWSE|1.0|Honestly just rent the original this really, really sucked. The rape scene was really sick but in a Drama sort of way, not a Horror sort of way. If you are going to see this film don't see the original first or you are going to be very, very disappointed.
B002BIULQ2|4.0|Sweet niblets, to my grown-up shame, it turns out I fall into this movie's target demographic. Saddled with babysitting a horde of pre-teen girls (and, yes, dammit, two hyper eight-year-olds count as a horde) and dragged protesting to the living room as HANNAH MONTANA - THE MOVIE began playing, I ended up liking the thing. So, now, I'm thinking about churning out text messages by the minute and typing out expressions like \\"gr8\\" and \\"bff\\" and \\"lol,\\" stuff I used to consider annoying. But, apparently, I'm right into this wheelhouse. I may even give up football.<br /><br />If you're down with HANNAH MONTANA - and, by you, I of course mean all the young girls under ten and their long-suffering parents - then you already know that the premise revolves around teenager Miley Stewart whose secret alter ego is pop star Hannah Montana. The thrust of the Disney sitcom series has always been Miley's striving to live a normal teenager's life and not allowing all the glitz and glamour of being Hannah go to her head. In HANNAH MONTANA - THE MOVIE, Miley finally gets too full of herself.<br /><br />Accused of having \\"gone California,\\" Miley is shanghaied to her Tennessee home by her father, in hopes that Miley will reconnect with what's really important in life. And, honestly, in a one-dimensional film like this, there's only so much breaking down you can do in discussing it. I think it's a safe bet that Miley'll get back to her countrified roots. There is, naturally, a childhood sweetheart grown into a straight talking teen cowboy, and, to me, the dude's got that Josh Harnett thing going on. He initially sees Miley as shallow. You know how that goes.<br /><br />The question is how do you get Cali-based Hannah Montana into rustic Tennessee. And this is where the evil land developer comes in, and, of course, he plans on constructing a mall at a woodsy habitat called Crowley Meadows. So a fundraiser event is required to save Crowley Meadows. To round off the story, a sleaze tabloid reporter is scurrying around the backwoods, trying to get dirt on Hannah Montana.<br /><br />The cool thing is, something does happen later on which transcends the film's television sitcom roots. Because up until that point, the story feels sort of old and predictable and I was thinking, \\"This could just as well be an extended episode of the show or maybe a television special.\\" But I wasn't expecting the twist, and for five seconds I had that feeling that \\"Wow, they're really switching it up.\\" But then that little girl speaks up and plonks us straight back into self-contained television sitcom reality. But it was good while it lasted.<br /><br />Fans of Oliver, Jackson, and Lilly may get a wee peeved because they're not so much in the film. Lilly gets the most screen time; Oliver is only there at the start. I thought Billy Ray Cyrus was solid, and old Achy-Breaky even gets a shot at romance. But his best moments are when he's in a scene with his daughter. Guest stars include Vanessa Williams as Hannah's publicist, Tyra Banks as disgruntled shoe shopper Tyra Banks, and Taylor Swift who sings a song.<br /><br />But it's all about Miley Cyrus. And that's as it should be. She carries the film, and I think enough of her to give this sucker four stars. Miley's performance lifts the film above its trite plot and the cheesy elements. And put me down as someone who prefers it when she sings as Miley rather than as Hannah. Hannah Montana's songs are pop lite stuff and eventually all sound the same to me. But the times when Miley Stewart was singing as herself, those were the songs I relished most: the energetic and catchy \\"Hoedown\\"; the sweet and tender duet with her dad, \\"Butterfly Fly Away\\"; and the powerful and soulful \\"The Climb,\\" which I say is the best song Miley Cyrus has ever sung.<br /><br />HANNAH MONTANA - THE MOVIE offers easy laughs, some good songs, a coming-of-age story, and a girl whose superstar status was something which I, frankly, initially believed to havebeen founded solely on the strength of the Disney machine. But I had it wrong. Miley Cyrus has real talent. She can act. And, for sure, she can belt out a tune. HANNAH MONTANA - THE MOVIE isn't for everyone, no. But, for those who dig this wholesome kind of shenanigans, this movie knocks it out of the park.<br /><br />Boom boom clap... boom di clap di clap... But what the hell are niblets, anyway?been founded solely on the strength of the Disney machine. But I had it wrong. Miley Cyrus has real talent. She can act. And, for sure, she can belt out a tune. HANNAH MONTANA - THE MOVIE isn't for everyone, no.

0783114893|4.0|I saw this movie years ago, about the time it was released, while I was still in high school, and it has stuck with me these years later.<br />My only real complaints are that the picture quality is only a little better than VHS, and the case actually has a glaring spoiler printed clearly right on the back!<br />What is wrong with these idiot DVD publishers that they would do THAT?!<br />My advice, for anyone thinking about buying this or watching it for the first time, is do NOT read the case back, unless you like to know how your movies are going to end before you even watch them.<br />Sheesh!<br /><br />Also, Amazon was consistent by getting it to me within a week, and that was via the slower Parcel Post.<br />Okay, with that said, this really is a terrific scary movie (hard to call it either horror or thriller), and you will probably be sitting in stunned silence after you see it for the first time.<br />Yes, Roger Ebert panned this when it first came out in 1986, but I have to disagree with his sentiments.<br />This is hardly in the league of those idiotic and sadistic \\"Saw\\" movies, which do little more than give the viewers prurient pleasure by watching what at least looks to me like celebrating the violence depicted therein.<br />This movie does not provide any real answers, for those of you out there searching for a meaning all nicely wrapped up with a bow at the end.<br />Also, while the movie has an \\"R\\" rating, the violence occurs largely off screen, which to me makes it far scarier than the graphic \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" type of footage.<br /><br />The supporting actors, C. Thomas Howell (Jim Halsey), Jennifer Jason Leigh (Nash), and Jeffrey DeMunn (Captain Estridge), all turn in decent performances, especially DeMunn, but make no mistake, Rutger Hauer (John Ryder, the Hitcher) dominates the screen.<br />Each twitch of his face will make you jump, and his sardonic stare will make your blood run cold.<br />He really gives a glimpse at what it would be like to see a psychopath in real life, yet he does it with an almost gentle quality, which makes it all the more disturbing.<br />Think about how disturbingly calm, polite, and coldly intelligent Anthony Hopkins was as Hannibal Lecter in \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" and you will get a pretty close idea.<br /><br />It was also interesting to watch Howell as Jim Halsey, steadily change from a terrified boy unable to even run, into someone who is willing to do what it takes to survive.<br />Jennifer Jason Leigh does a good performance as a Texan local girl who helps Halsey, and I really am glad that (for once!) there was no romance as such for the story, even though any man would have been more than a little interested in her because of her looks.<br />I have seen Jeffrey DeMunn in several other movies, and he really is convincing as Captain Estridge, going from sympathetic to tough, as any experienced cop should be.<br /><br />One word of advice to those of you with kids.<br />As I said, the violence, including the climactic scene near the end, is largely off screen.<br />However, if you have very young kids who get nightmares easily, you might be better served by waiting until they are a bit older and more mature.<br />With all that said, very good movie, despite what the critics may have said.<br />Check it out.
1591391105|4.0|First off I want to say I did not find anything in this book that I have not read or heard before.  It is just presented here in a different way.  So if you have not read dozens of other books on management, then you will find a lot of really good information here.<br /><br />The first 90 days in a new job, or a new position is always critical.  Assumptions were made about your abilities and now is the time for you to shine.  The author lays out a number of things you should focus on.  An important one is you really need to learn to speed up your learning process.  A new position means new things you need to learn.  Do you learn at the rate of everyone else, or do you kick it up and pull ahead of everyone else?<br /><br />The author talks about aligning and building your team.  You cannot be successful unless you get your team to \\"buy in\\" to your vision and plan.  They will work for you, you just have to get them to see what you want.  You also need to expedite their plans.  Do what you can to help them in their plans and they will work harder for you.<br /><br />A few other important topics are promote yourself, secure early wins, and create coalitions.  The early wins are important.  And they do not need to be huge wins, small wins show progress and help improve the bottom line.  I have seen too many people that only try for home runs, they usually strike out.  I have also seen a few that go for singles, and they outlast and outperform everyone.

0783223676|5.0|This was a comment I gave several years ago. I checked Amazon from time to time to see if it was available in a wide screen DVD, then Blue-ray. I finally got my wish fulfilled. This is a beautiful copy, audio and video.  &#34;I love this film, but I don't enjoy watching full screen movies on my wide-screen TV. Some DVD's get reissued every five minutes, while others seem to be forgotten. It can't be because this was a small independent production. Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis, have hardly been forgotten. What's the deal?? And what about &#34;Private Benjamin&#34;? Is it a Goldie Hawn thing?

B00168HARG|5.0|Words, words, words.   They are difficult to contain the love I have for this series.    This love also comes with a broken heart.   It's cancellation hurts more than anything that has ever been canceled.   I can't believe it.     This series, its characters, its story: ICONIC.       This is a half told story.  This was Josh Friedman's Terminator story.  It is the greatest.  And I love him for it.   It is the greatest, and I love it, and they killed it.    The only hope I see for its return is if the sales for Season 2 on September 22 are monumental.   The sales would speak volumes and get attention.   It's the only way I see.     They need Josh Friedman to make the other two seasons to finish the story.    As for this particular product: Season One.    BUY IT.    That is all.   Buy The Terminator on Blu-Ray.   Buy Terminator 2: Judgment Day on Blu-Ray.   Buy Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles Season One and Season Two on Blu-Ray.    Then you have yourself the complete story (so far, if it returns).    Season 2 does have a very appropriate ending.  It's beautiful as the last moment of the series.    But knowing there was more coming and it getting canceled, that is just wrong.    I declare this possibly my favorite series ever.      Watch T1, T2, T:TSCC Season 1, and T:TSCC Season 2.  In that order.   And you have yourself one of the most beautiful, important, and most moving stories ever told.
1416562605|2.0|The book had a plausible story line. The author did a good job of keeping it interesting and having the reader involved. Some of the descriptions of Balram's rural life were very realistic.  But, in what world is he living? The India he is talking of, no doubt exists to a certain degree, but the darkness and socialist party references were a little too much. I feel that maybe the author left India about 30 years ago and still has the image of the time he left with him. I do not mean to discredit his description of the rural life, because little no change has occurred in that field. However I did find the big picture a little stale. It almost felt like he wrote the book for a certain type of reader. The kind of reader who is looking for mystery or mysticism in India, the land of snake charmers and yogis. The book had a very stereotypical feel to it, enhancing and embellishing the poverty, death decay etc.
B000001E21|4.0|It's still a good album, but the title is not appropriate as these I think are new songs. Def Leppard tried hard to stay within their roots despite having to battle grunge. In the result I guess how this can be called \\"Retro Active\\" is that it sounds like the days of \\"On Through The Night\\", and \\"High And Dry\\". I used to have this album, and didn't make it as far as the studio version of \\"Miss You In A Heartbeat\\". I guess I didn't give it half a chance as I just didn't like \\"Hysteria\\", and \\"Adrenalize\\". However, this one is pretty good. It starts off with \\"Desert Song\\" which is definitely the closest thing to grunge these guys would do, but then they get back to the hard rock that they are nortorius for. With \\"Fractured Love\\", a good cover of the Sweet's \\"Action\\", \\"Ride Into The Sun\\", etc. The albums weak point is the song \\"Two Steps Behind\\" as it's a weak ballad. It also closes with an almost folk-rock song called  \\"I Want To Be Your Hero\\". I just looked at another review, and this was a b-sides, rarties album, so I guess that explains the title. As I said still a good album, but it wasn't strong enough to go against the grunge machine.
B0000042H4|5.0|For being the first complete recording of The Ring in history, it still holds it's place as the best cycle one can buy. All the performers are in their prime, most notably Nilsson and Windgassen. Both are superb, and have forever ruined me, as far as I'm concerned (I will always compare everyone else to them).  The first time I heard The Ring, it was Karajan's version. I immediately was bored to death by it, and almost completely turned me away from the cycle. Luckily, a few friends referred me to this recording, and I immediately fell in love with it.  Solti does not disappoint in this recording either. His interpretation is fiery, thorough, and always interesting (which can be quite a challenge when you run into places of around 30 minutes of recitative). He has excellent control over the Vienna Phil and gives every measure a heart-felt reading.   Until I hear a recording that is as astounding as this, I will refer everyone to this recording alone. If the price is intimidating to you (it definitely is to me), look for it in your public library. It's not hard to find for free, it just takes a bit of searching.
0545123267|3.0|First let me start by saying that I am a fan of the Twilight series so when I heard this book was similar but with werewolves, I'm jumped on the chance of reading it. However, I found myself forcing myself to finish this book. It was boring and most of it made no real sense. There was no plot and the book was filled with metaphors and it made no sense. I read Twilight in 1 day and this book took me 2 weeks because it did not hold my interest and was no invested in the story at all.

006135323X|5.0|This was a great book.  Found it interesting to get the inside scoop on why people make the decisions that they do.  This would be a great book for anybody involved in marketing.  It would also work well for people who are dating, selling, or doing anything else where persuasion is necessary.  I am not involved in marketing, but found it interesting because it explains consumer behavior.  And yes, that means YOU. :)    Those who enjoyed this should look for his podcast.

Written by Franc Rodder (who also directed this film), Dave Humphries and Martin Stellman, \\"Quadrophenia\\" (1979) was rock group The Who's explosive, enthralling musical tribute to the mods and rockers of the swinging sixties.    \\"Quadrophenia\\" boasts a stellar cast list, headed by a riviting, powerful performance from the ever-great Phil Daniels. The rest of the cast are full of familiar faces such as the legendary ex-lead singer of The police, Sting, Mark Wingett (later famous for his role as DCI Jim Carver in ITV's police drama \\"The Bill\\"), Philip Davis (who's list of film and television credits are endless), Leslie Ash (long before her days as one of the leading stars in ITV's action-drama \\"C.A.T.S Eyes\\" and the classic BBC sitcom \\"Men Behaving Badly\\"), singer Toyah Wilcox, the ultimate screen hard-man Ray Winstone (though is disappointingly given very limited screen time), Garry Cooper, Trevor Laird, Michael Elphick (later known for his lead role in ITV's \\"Boon\\"), Kate Williams, Kim Nave and Gary Shail. Each of these immensely talented actors are all finely tuned into their characterisations, but for me the true star of the show is, without a doubt, the dynamic Phil Daniels.    \\"Quadrophenia\\" is set in the heart of London in 1964, where two rival cult groups have emerged - the mods and the rockers. As Pete Townshend of The Who aptly quoted: \\"Mod is a shorter word for young, beautiful and stupid\\". For Jimmy (Phil Daniels) being a mod is simply a way of life and for him and his mates the ONLY way of life. They dress in suits, pop pills like their sweets in a candy store, ride around wrecklessly on their scooters, thriving off the many violent clashes with their rivals - the rockers.    A wild trip to \\"sunny\\" Brighton sees the mods make headline news as they encounter the rockers and a deadly riot erupts, spreading throughout Brighton like wild fire. Amusingly during the riot, Jimmy finally gets the girls of his dreams - Steph (Lesley Ash) - and sneaks off down a back alley with her to consummate their \\"relationship\\" (well poor Jimmy thinks its the beginning of a relationship but for Steph its merley a one-night stand) before hes arrested and carted off in a riot van for his part in the riot. His so-called friends leave Jimmy behind to face the trial alone and his supposed best friend Dave (Mark Wingett) wastes no time in taking away Jimmys girl, Steph.    On returning home and discovering the betrayal and distinct lack of loyalty from his friends Jimmy becomes disheartened. Making matters worse is where his intolerable mother (Kate Williams) boots him out of his home - and no one wants to know or help, least of all Steph. His mental state is rapidly deterioating with his incessant drug taking, boshing pills like theres no tomorrow. I wont reveal the ending as dont wish to spoil it for those that have yet to see this classic British film, but will says its a corker!    \\"Quadrophenia\\" is a belter right from the opening scene which sees Jimmy happily riding along on his beloved scooter through the streets of London, seemingly without a care in the world. There are many fun, blazing party and orgi scenes, all of which are injected with humour, not least to some cracking one-liners from the always impeccably-timed Phil Daniels. To accompany these scenes is a sizzling soundtrack. The 60's dancing and the costumes and hair styles are all very authentic in detail.    Undoubtedtly the most rip-roaring, exciting, adrenalin-pumping scenes are where the mods head off to Brighton for a weekend of hard-partying and drug-taking. All suddnly spirals out of control when they come across the rockers and a major riot breaks out, fighting everywhere from the beach, to insides pubs, clubs and other establishements - nowhere or no one is left safe! Breathtaking scenes and all visually, incredibly powerful. You just wander where its all going to end and who's gonna get killed first.    Jimmy is played expertly by Phil Daniels who is dynamic throughout. His character is fun, funny, daring, seemingly full of life but at the same is mentally unstable and this masquerades his sadness and confusion. His home life is explored and you see that a lot of his escalting emotional problems stems from his irresponsive mother who is more interested in her partner than listening to her sons problems. Though there are many laughs packed in \\"Quadrophenia\\", obviously with the subject matter, theres plenty of serious drama and the ending proves a shocker. Phil Daniels is both likeable and totally convincing in his flawless and literally perfect performance.    Mark Wingett (Dave) and Philip Davis (Chalky) both excell in their roles, providing many of the films humorous moments and delivering equally likeable characterisations. Sting makes a very impressive acting debut as the cool Ace Face, who is admired and emulated by the mods for his slick, stylish dance routines. He appears to be refined from the outset but soon lets rip during the rip-roaring Brighton scenes.    Leslie Ash (steph) and Toyah Wilcox (Monkey - shes almost unrecognisable) are both splendid in their roles, breezing into the atmosphere effortlessly, while Garry Cooper shines in his roles as Peter. Only very minor quibble about \\"Quadrophenia\\" is that Ray Winstone, as Kevin, is only seen in a handful of scenes but theres great comic value in one scene where Kevin And Jimmy are both bathing (seperately of course!) and try and out-sing each other. Kevin is an old friend of Jimmys but their paths rarely cross as Kevin is one of the rockers. You will laugh when you see Ray dressed as a rocker with slick leather jacket and Elvis Presley-like hairstyle - a far cry from the usual hard man we see.    On the whole, \\"Quadrophenia\\" is a rollercoaster ride of a film and easily one of the most definitive and innovative films of its time. It's no understatement to declaire that \\"Quadrophenia\\", is an out and out masterpiece.    Ian Phillips  August 2009
6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell is one of the rare sci-fi movies that manages to entertain as well as pose interesting questions.  To often sci-fi is used as entertainment only with fun trappings of zipping space ships and explosions. There is a place for that kind of story and hell, I enjoy them.    But every once in a while I wish there was more stuff like Ghost in the Shell.  You get a interesting story with a resolution that makes you think.  On top of that, the animation is still stunning even over a decade later.  For me it ranks up there with the top tier animated films like \\"Princess Mononoke\\" and \\"Akira\\".    First off the animation is very impressive for a number of reasons.  The backgrounds include amazing amounts of detail for a mid 90's feature.  There is some use of CG, but there is plenty of hand drawn stuff here.  The most stunning sequence is where the Major is journeying down the water ways of the city.  There is no dialogue, only animation and music.  The visuals show the city living around her, no freeze frames or still bodies, everything is moving and alive.  It starts to rain and the effect is amazing, transforming this near future metropolis into something beautiful and sad all at the same time.    Those familiar with the manga by Shirow will be a bit disappointed to see much of his character design has been revamped.  The characters are given a more realistic look and the comedy of the manga has been toned way down - instead the movie is deadly serious and very moody.    The action set pieces are top notch.  The two key ones are a chase into a crowded market place.  Again, everything is moving in the market, the villain is camouflaged and attempting a desperate escape.  The tension is high and the visuals are excellent.  The second involves the Major being seriously outgunned by a tank, and yet doing everything she can to turn the tables.  The animation is fluid and angles and mood are used to drive the intensity to a solid climax.    The story combines elements from the manga, picking up a villain here, a plot point here, a revelation there and mixing them all together.  Normally this type of approach could end up hurting the film and creating a mish mash of story lines.  But the writers have integrated all of it together very well.  The key story involves the puppet master and his quest to become something more.    It is the themes that are in the manga and are well executed in the anime that make this film work so well.  The character of the puppetmaster is interesting (and probably based off the idea introduced in the novel \\"Neuromancer\\"), and it's quest is intriguing.  The ending always leaves me a bit chilled.  What kind of being has been created and what will it do.  The possibilities are endless.    The sound effects and music are well done and used to help create and sustain mood.  As I mentioned this mood is one of tension and melancholy.  The score is interesting in that it uses a very traditional Japanese sound and mixes it with a minimalistic and sparse soundscape.  It's very effective in the film, but I know several people that find the main theme to this film to be too discordant and irritating.  I think it fits in its own way, but I also understand their point of view.    Voice acting in Japanese fits the film a little better than the English cast does.  When I first saw the movie it was with the English cast and some of the lines just never seemed to click.  I'm not sure if they were playing the cyborg characters as robots or just trying to affect the gloom of the film in the voices, but it just didn't work.  The Japanese actors seem to have a better handle on it and the subtitled script seems a little clearer as well.    Director Mamoru Oshii takes all these pieces and adds his own spin on it.  Oshii is a man who takes his time telling a story.  Even though there are moments of explosive action, for the most part the movie moves at a slow pace, allowing the viewer to drink in the world of the film and most importantly the mood.  This creates a common complaint I see leveled against the movie - it's boring.  I see where the argument comes from, but I'm never bored watching it.  It is not an action film: it is an idea film with action in it.  The themes of humanity and identity are what drive the film - not the action.  As I mentioned this is very different from what Shirow did in his manga.  The themes were there and sometimes they were focused on, but it was done with more humor and more action.  It doesn't make Oshii's approach wrong, or Shirow's right.  In fact I enjoy both.  Oshii adapted the manga and put his own touch on it, and for me he struck a great balance.  This was disrupted a bit in his follow up which ended up sacrificing storytelling for philosophy - but that's another review.    This is not part of the \\"Stand Alone Complex\\" television series.  It does lead into the second feature film, \\"Innocence\\", but as I said it is not directly tied to Shirow's work.  Still it's a great price for a classic sci-fi anime.
6304712936|5.0|Excellent movie and fantastic interpretation of Amadeus Mozart's life.  The character is alive and real - although the dialogue is in today's English, it makes it more compelling.  There is some poetic license in the movie, but the story is a good biography set in the early 1800's.<br /><br />A priest rides into Salzberg to hear an old man's confession to a priest of his jealousy of Mozart (Tom Hulce) and anger toward God that he did not inherit Mozart's talent.  The old man is Antonio Saleri and his narration gives the story of Mozart's life.  He starts with how Mozart's father takes him to royal courts and makes him perform like a \\"little monkey\\".  Antonio Saleri was a famous musician in Vienna and part of the King's court.  He feels overshadowed by Mozart - a young, spoiled, raucous upstart, that can compose heavenly music - that only God could have given him this amazing talent..<br /><br />We see and hear Mozart's masterful works performed, as well as his new and innovative ways of presenting opera and symphonies.<br /><br />Mozart attends a party with his father and wife - and ends up mocking Saleri's music in good fun.  Saleri is behind a mask (masks were popular at the time) and is insulted.  The genius of Mozart is framed as Saleri is more and more tormented that only he would understand the gift - and revere thankfully worship God with dignity.  He is so angry he burns a crucifix.<br /><br />Mozart's life is short, debt-ridden, but burns bright.  He has immortality in his music.  Saleri knows he will never be remembered as great as Mozart, and as a weak, embittered man continues plotting to be more famous.  He fails in the end, Saleri is forgettable, Mozart is the brilliant unforgettable creator.
034544678X|3.0|I got some good information I could use so that was favorable.  I was hoping for more training help rather than background (comparing humans to apes) vs. dogs.  This is not a criticism but rather it was boring.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|If even something is great in this movie it's a character's (Will Smith's own?) muscular body.<br /><br />A completely illogical film of a scientist having survived the virus transforming people into flash-eating zombies has climaxed into him becoming a world saviour by donating his own healing blood upon being consumed by these mutants.<br /><br />I prefer New York City in its glory rather than mutilated post-apocalypse rubbish-side of dementia-suffering nightmares.
B000002KHH|5.0|This is one of my favorte albums of all time!! Black Sabbath is one of THEE best rock groups ever and this CD proves it!! Ozzy provides incredibl vocals and the messages are powerful.
B001DDBCUA|1.0|OK tonight I tried to sit through the movie Sex and the city. It is without a doubt one of the largest pieces of garbage that Hollywood has EVER produced. And as far as female empowerment goes, June Cleaver was more independent and cutting edge than this glorified harlequin romance novel for the 21st century.  I admit - I used to watch the show when it was first on. Back then, it WAS edgy. It DID make its points about separation of the sexes and their differences. By show casing four distinct classic female archetypes, it showed how these women COULD keep that classic archetype and STILL be relevant in a world that had left the 'golden age of feminine mystique' behind for a female that was based on a male image. Well, at least it did in its early incarnation.  Then, the series became popular, and critiqued, and copied, and studied. And with the microscopic concentration it received, the producers felt the need to focus only on the cheap laughs and the superficiality and the vanity, and leave behind the original 'catch'. Instead of being cutting edge, this show had now become a walking and talking live animation edition of any of the mountain of superficial plastic carbon copy fashion magazines publishers are still trying to force onto women. It devolved into no more than that. It was NO LONGER groundbreaking; it was no longer MODERN or FEMINIST-ic; it had degenerated the women's movement to circa 1925. The fact that these women were 'professional' women became a subplot to their superficiality, their vanity, and the sub-textual clues that the producer/creators/SPONSORS felt women belong married and being a mother. While that ending was predetermined for the Charlotte character from episode one, to see the fiercely independent characters of Samantha and Miranda be shackled to relationships that were NOT befitting of their traits was insulting to all audience members, but most especially to women. The final seasons made a mockery of feminism and progressiveness, and instead left the bad taste of MATERIALISM, SUPERFICIALITY, and the concept of APPEARANCES over FOUNDATION.   Then came the movie. While I admit again I could not watch the whole movie (well at least not sober), the one hour and five minutes I did force myself to sit through was both painful and an abomination.  No, I am not a woman, nor do I confess to think like a woman or pretend to relate to women's situations. That is a task I could never come up to. But what was different between the first two seasons of the show and the later seasons/movie is that, you did not FEEL like an outsider. You felt like you were seeing INDEPENDENT women making their way through the world ON THEIR OWN. The later seasons, and MOST ESPECIALLY the movie, have taken women back almost a full century. Take away the jobs and the modern conveniences, and you have any woman from the early 1900's. And to further degenerate women is the fact that the characters 'gave in' to the status quo, just to receive acceptance (e.g. - Carrie wearing the 'fancy' dress; Carrie 'agreeing' to the LAVISH/LARGE wedding). Maybe I misunderstand the early seasons, and that the above was their intention all along. If that is the case, then I am sorry I ever watched it. The concept the movie was sending out was FIT IN, WEAR FANCY CLOTHES, SPEND LOTS OF MONEY, AND YOU WILL BE CORRECT. I always assumed one of the points of the early seasons was that women were WISE enough to see the male figure as it was and when they fell in love with the male (the FINAL fall); they fell in love with the man...AS HE WAS. In the show and the movie, it was TABOO to have a male figure suggest a female character change. But like the trash pulp 'romance\\" novels of old, the female character's PURPOSE was to have the male character of its choosing either conform to the female's desires/needs/wants, or it was over. And those desires/needs/wants were ALWAYS superficial and materialistic. This movie to me is a slap in the face to feminism, intelligent viewers, and most especially WOMEN. I am offended that this movie was ever made, and apologize to any woman who felt a connection to this SUPERFICIAL, MATERIALISTIC, VAIN portrayal of the trial and tribulations of being a female.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|Came into this series late in the game, after the series had ended. Couldn't stop watching it on Netflix and paid for Season 6 here. I have never been hooked on a series but this one [...] me in and when I reached the end of the final episode I felt that my best friend had dropped into a black hole. Well, not really, but what acting what direction and I don't care who killed Jenny. Life and this series aren't always neat. I'm really going to miss Shane's character. Complex. Aren't we all? What's with these whiners who are giving the show a bad rating just because they don't know who killed Jenny. The point was everyone wanted her dead and in that tightly knit group it didn't matter who did the deed. Maybe that was the point.
B000093BDX|4.0|The Beach Boys' 2003 compilation 'Sounds of Summer - The Very Best of The Beach Boys' is an accurate title, yet at the same time, is somewhat of an inaccurate title. From 1962 to present day, The Beach Boys have been one of America's best bands, making artistic masterpieces ('Pet Sounds') and even writing songs about surfing, girls, and cars (1962-1965). That's what made the Beach Boys great.    'The Sounds of Summer - The Very Best of The Beach Boys' tries to summarize these on one CD. Spanning the years 1962 to 1989 and including 30 songs, this album is about as comprehensive as one can get for a single disc. Read on.    Starting in 1962 with 'Surfin' Safari' (but oddly omitting the other hit single from this year, '409'), 'The Sounds of Summer' kicks off in high gear. Containing most of the great other songs from 1962-1965, including 'Surfin' USA,' 'Shut Down,' 'Fun Fun Fun,' 'Help Me Rhonda,' among many others.    Then we hit 'Pet Sounds,' from 1966. That groundbreaking album that changed pop music forever thanks to the genius that was (and still is) Brian Wilson. Represented from that album here are 'Sloop John B,' 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and perhaps my favorite Beach Boys song 'God Only Knows.'     1968-1989 is represented modestly, with 'Heroes and Villains,' 'Darlin',' 'Do It Again,' 'I Can Hear Music,' 'Getcha Back,' 'Kokomo,' among others. It's got most of the hits from that period, but there was far more to the Beach Boys during this period then what's offered here.    This disc stops at 1989, which is great, because most of what The Beach Boys did in the 1990s was an embarrassment. Oh, who am I kidding, ALL of it was an embarrassment. 'Stars and Stripes Vol. 1' was absolutely dreadful and fortunately for us, none of that album is represented here.     To get a full picture of the Beach Boys, you need to buy 'The Warmth of the Sun,' the 2007 sequel to this album, along with this to get an accurate portrait of this legendary California group. That disc has much of their 1970s triumphs, something that's missing here (other than 'Come Go With Me,' from 1978), including 'Til I Die,' 'It's OK,' 'Surf's Up,' and many more. Buy them both if you truly want 'The Very Best of the Beach Boys.'    Something else to note is 'Caroline No,' one of the best songs from 'Pet Sounds' and Brian Wilson's first single as a solo artist in 1966, is omitted from both collections. That's so irritating. One has to wonder why they call it 'The VERY BEST of The Beach Boys' when arguably one of their finest moments is omitted from both of their albums.    Overall, 'Sounds of Summer' is not truly the very best of the Beach Boys because if it were, it'd be two, maybe three discs. But for a single disc collection, this certainly isn't bad at all. It's about as good as it gets actually.     I recommend this for the casual fan or the new Beach Boys. I advise the new Beach Boys fan to buy this, 'The Warmth of the Sun,' and eventually, 'Pet Sounds,' one of the greatest albums ever made, from 1966.     Recommended for the new or casual Beach Boys fan.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Overall a great new series filled with a raw edginess that I couldn't get enough of.<br />The show first aired on Fox's FX cable channel in fall of 2008.  Fox had been airing trailers all over the cable world attempting to drum up interest in the new series.  However, the trailers they aired showed nothing of the series, making it impossible to tell what the series was about.  So of course I had to tune in to find out.  And I was pleasantly, sometimes overwhelmingly surprised at how good the show was.<br />The show features a biker gang from a small town who run drugs and guns to keep their gang and the money flowing, while bartering to keep the local law off their backs.  Plus they have to contend with other gangs who want to take over their turf or just plain take their money.<br />The gang is headed by Clay (actor Ron Perlman and star of the movie `Hellboy') with strong influence from the next biker generation, Jax (actor Charlie Hunnam who played Nathan in `Queer as Folk' and Katie Holmes love interest in the movie `Abandon'), who is the son of the co-founder of the gang.  Jax's mom, Gemma (actress Katey Sagal formerly of the well known `Married with Children' TV series), is also the old lady to Clay and plays a vital sometimes brutal role in the gang.  And then to make things interesting, they throw in Jax's ex-girlfriend, Tara, formerly part of the gang, who is now a doctor at the local hospital.<br />Outstanding variety of characters, excellent casting all around, great story and subplots that add even more drama to the dramatic, and just some laugh out loud or downright crazy stuff that happens in each episode.  I was blown away with Jax, as a character (and the actor who played him) because of the depth and conflicted duality he seemed to contain just below the surface that keep me riveted to the screen.  And I was floored by Gemma, she was just so awesome, like a mother bear protecting her cubs.<br />The one flaw of the show, for me, and it's a small one since the show doesn't have a lot of it, were the sex scenes with Jax and the female partners (especially the ex-girlfriend Tara).  They just didn't feel 'real' to me.  They seemed very awkward, like it was actors trying to create a sex scene for the characters.<br />Season 2 of the series is to set air on the FX channel on September 8, 2009.t have a lot of it, were the sex scenes with Jax and the female partners (especially the ex-girlfriend Tara).

B0028DRGDQ|5.0|I am going to assume that, if you are reading this, you already know that this movie is the original predecessor to the recent American film Quarantine. As of this writing, I have not seen that film, so I cannot fully compare the two. However, I will note that it seems the only positive reviews of the American adaptation came from those who did not view this movie first.<br /><br />That being said, if you have seen and enjoyed Quarantine, I will wager that you will like this this movie. In fact, I consider this to be one of a very few \\"Must See\\" horror movies from the past 10 years.<br /><br />The story is simple, and has been relayed in countless other reviews here, so I will keep the synopsis short:<br /><br />A TV show hostess visits a local firehouse for an evening to see what a fireman's life is like, and upon finding that it can be boring, wishes there were some sort of call to go on. Soon enough, she gets her wish, as the firemen are called to an apartment building to rescue an old woman, something the firemen view as a routine call. However, upon arriving at the building, the group finds that things are not as routine as they expected, and they are quickly sealed in until further notice due to a possible outbreak of disease, with all contact to the outside world severed. As tensions rise among the tenants, the hostess and camera man set about documenting what they feel \\"the public needs to know.\\" What they find is more horrific than they could ever imagine...<br /><br />And now for my opinion:<br /><br />The scares in this movie are not your typical \\"jumpers,\\" meaning that they do not come from cheap musical effects while someone comes around a corner. No, the real scares here come from the dark, claustrophobic, hallways of the building and the noises coming from off camera. In short, the atmosphere of the film creates an edge-of-your-seat type of tension that slowly builds until something shocking pushes it over the top; where it begins all over again. In fact, even the things that I knew were about to happen still managed to scare me; something that is very rare these days.<br /><br />The movie also doesn't resort to cheap gore effects to frighten the viewer. Now don't get me wrong, I like the red stuff just as much as the next guy, but it seems too many movies these days are just laying it on to get a reaction. This doesn't mean that there is no blood in this film. In fact, there is quite a bit of blood, but none of it is spilled without any reason or effect. The same can be said for the \\"monsters\\" in the film. For most of the time, they are kept just off camera (though you can hear their odd noises in the background all along), but when they reveal themselves you certainly get the effect that the filmmakers intended. And while I'm on the subject, the \\"monsters\\" are not zombies, as people have taken to calling them; they are people who have been infected by something that is not clearly revealed (though it is hinted at during the final climax).<br /><br />The less-is-more approach used in this movie was perfect because, luckily, the directors kept the running time on the short side at a lean 73 minutes or so. This means that the movie avoids the dragging feeling that most others of it's type wind up producing (Blair Witch anyone?). Granted, the first 20 minutes or so (when the hostess is at the firehouse) are a little slow, but during that time you are basically getting to know the characters who will become your main focus, and this helps make what happens to them later all the more unpleasant. That being said, you must also keep in mind that once they get to the apartment building, the pace picks up greatly and the scares remain constant up through the last 10 minutes or so, where the situation explodes into a veritable frenzy of scares and suspense. In fact, these 10 minutes are the perfect culmination to the build-ups before them. Think of it as a roller coaster where they save the giant hill for last...<br /><br />In short, I think that all horror fans should really take a chance and watch this movie. Additionally, I would strongly advise against viewing the remake beforehand as I have the feeling that it may ruin the suspense since you will know everything that is in store and I've heard that it is much less atmospheric.chance and watch this movie.

B0029LHW4A|4.0|This is the most lively sounding Jet cd to date. Not much for ballads on this upbeat rockin of an album. Their previous two had several ballads each, this one has the last track \\"She Holds A Grudge\\" as the only really slow song. As usual with Jet, the guitars is where the focus is and they are great as usual, while the lyrics are decent, but sometimes a bit silly. Highlights include \\"She's A Genius\\", \\"Goodbye Hollywood\\", \\"Black Hearts(On Fire\\", and  \\"Walk\\".  The rest are fair to good, nothing really that weak in my opinion, but the four tracks I listed are the must haves for any Jet fan.
B002EWD08Q|5.0|Granted I have only herd this about 3 times, but I have to say this cd is better then the current state of modern rock or the stuff you hear on the radio. . Every song is very different a cohesive album is far from what this is which I love.. come  on people seem to love bands that all the songs sound the same? Or a even worse a band that uses compressed or auto tune on a rock song.... If you like old school rock you will love this cd
B0002ZMITY|1.0|Though I am a fan, I unfortunately have no choice but to give this movie 1/5 stars (because I couldn't give it 0/5).    If you know about Sacha Baron Cohen from his recent films (Bruno, Borat, Talladega Nights), you'll probably be interested in Ali G, his first over the top persona.    This movie was released as a spin-off of the tv show in 2002 and it is in a completely different comic vein than the rest of his work.  Though he did write and produce the flick, somehow it turned out to be completely incongruous with his otherwise exceptional and unique blend of wit, graceless incompetence, and subtle, good-spirited mockery.    Baron Cohen's brilliance lies in his ability to manipulate real situations; to build an incredibly awkward framework, a uniquely clumsy and ludicrous sphere of consciousness almost, within which like a mad puppeteer, or a perverted symphonic conductor of the absurd, he directs and orchestrates scenes on the fly from directly within them.  There's an anxious and sometimes frantic quality about the situational structure of the film, thanks in large part to the direction of Larry Charles.  The approach he took with Borat, Religilous with Bill Maher, and again with Bruno (which I haven't seen yet, can't wait for the DVDRips to come out-- DVD will be released September 30!), the viewer experiences a strange sensation` that resembels being shocked, but is more along the lines of not being able to believe what you're [...] seeing.    In Borat, not only the performance of Baron Cohen but the whole tone of what writing there was (being that the film is largely improvisational in nature) and the production was extremely cohesive, and displayed sense of being \\"in character\\" so ingrained and so intrinsic that real people in real situations end up involuntarily in one sense and voluntarily in another, playing \\"the straight man\\".  As they play along and indulge the antics of these over the top, and often baffling characters, steadily the evelope is pushed alittle further and a little further until you come to find yourself not so much shocked, but awed at it's sheer audacity.  The best moments of these films, many as there are, usually come when the \\"participants\\" as I suppose they may be called are goaded or, to be more accurate, baited into either making their bed or digging their grave.  And in the end quite a lot of the most memorable lines in the films are not scripted-- the stuff they couldn't make up.    Where these other films were revolutionary in that respect, Ali G Indahouse is anything but.  This cheesy, low brow, nigh unwatchable drivel from the very first scene descends to a level akin to the likes of Tom Green, How High, Amerikaz Most Wanted, and almost anything Martin Lawrence has ever done.  It's depressing almost when you consider how clever the other stuff is.  And granted, the \\"blue\\" humor (ie, dick jokes. lots of dick jokes.) does show up in the other material, but it is certainly approached in a fashion that is far removed from the hyperactive 3rd grader mentality which this straight-to-DVD grade crap exhibits.     So there it is.    On the other hand, I do highly recommend [[ASIN:B000JBXH82 Da Ali G Show]], the television series where the characters of Borat and Bruno started, which ran over a span of four years between Channel 4 in the UK and HBO in the US.    I could tell you, but you really ought to just see for yourself how hilarious it is.    In conclusion,      BOOYAKASHAW! Keep it Real! Don't get mashed up! Big up yaself! Respek.
B001TKK39S|5.0|Haydn's greatness needs an interpreter. The greatness is on the page, but translating it into sound requires some judgment and inflection. Bernstein delivers in this set. I agree that some of the recordings are sub-par -- the string sound is at times too hot, the overall perspective too close-miked -- but Bernstein's vigorous and well-phrased reading overcomes those minor flaws. He was in his prime in these recordings from 1958-75.
1400063736|3.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did.  Instead, I found was a collection of arbitrary thought all muddled together encompassed by one or two centralized themes.<br /><br />From the start of this book, I disliked the style of writing.  At first I thought it like Stephen King's obsessive description of banal detail.  Then I thought Kerouac and his three word mundane sentences.  This happens.  That happens.  This exists.  This is bad.  This exists.  They are there.  I am here.  At times I found the flow of Eggers or Sedaris, but I couldn't get incredibly interested in the story or it's characters.  There seem to be just a bucketful of stories, as I said before, all muddled together in hopes of it being tied together in a neat little bow.<br /><br />There are sometimes contemporary, historical, or pop-culture references that sometimes hold me into the section for a little longer, but all in all I was rarely engaged and did not feel it to be a page turner.  I like certain relationships the protagonist has with the people he meets.  I like the places he goes to visit, but for me the biggest flaw was in the non-descript style of writing.  In my opinion it seems as though the writer can not find his voice, and it is not conducive to the story(ies) at all.  There was no flow.<br /><br />\\"Let the Great World Spin\\" may be attractive to several readers, but for me it was far from any literary masterpiece.
B0021L8US0|1.0|This the worst movie I've seen since \\"Reno 911\\". It's like something you would see on the SCIFI channel and after watching ten minutes of it change the channel. It's not scary, it's not intriguing. The way it was shot is also annoying. Like watching a regular broadcast on your HD TV. It's an ugly movie with lots of puking, garbage, and dead rotting meat. We left halfway through. The best part was the previews of upcoming movies. Another over hyped piece of [...].
B000W9EOEC|5.0|I've been a Daft Punk fan since their arrival onto the dance scene in the mid 90's.  Being a dance DJ myself I was immediately entranced by their use of beats, loops, snyths, vocodors and samples to create their music.  With Alive 2007 they've simply outdone themselves.  They continously and seemlessly mix between 2-3 tracks at a time creating an absolutely amazing listening experience.  This album has been has been on my iPod since the day I bought it. Its tracks have by far the highest play count (well over 50 times each) of anything else in my iTunes.  Here are my ratings on the tracklisting;<br /><br />1.  Robot Rock / Oh Yeah 10/10<br />2.

If you love dance music or Daft Punk this is one album you simply must own.  My only regret is that I wasn't able to attend the live performance. I've just watched cellphone clips on YouTube, which in itself were amazing.
B001V9LRTM|1.0|Just awful. They took a great movie and gutted it. Rainbow Song by John Sebastion was replaced by some slop. The perfect 3 song set by Sly and The Family Stone was dismembered down to 2 out of sequence. Just a terrible result. They should have just left the original alone. So disappointed !!
B001TOD92C|5.0|A masterful meditation on masculinity, fame and locating one's self in an artificial paradise, this is probably Aronofsky's best film driven by a stellar performance by Rourke that outdoes his Bukowski-imbibed character in \\"Barfly\\".

For press releases, awards, and more news, visit the official Enlightenment Productions website.<br /><br />For me, this book & film are stunning, visual masterpieces. It is subtle, but very erotic, with a beautiful classic score,that matches the pictureque and rich characters that Shamim Sarif creates in this world in the book. They have been hailed by major directors as incredible accomplishments. The sweeping visual landscape, and texture and layers of the setting, costumes, characters and lifestyle are simply magnificent and breathtaking. The film also masterfully captures the inhumanity, humiliation, cruelty and robbing of dignity caused by the laws of the period.<br /><br />It is a period piece, set in 1950's South Africa and tells the heartfelt and heart-breaking story of two women who find each other under during a chance encounter which awakens an emotional connection that ultimately unites them in heart, mind and soul. This occurs during a time period, where mixed race relationships are considered criminal, and the country has taken for granted that this should be acceptable. That is, except for those that characters that fight to revolt against this, and believe in equality.<br /><br />This includes Amina, the rebellious, courageous character (Sheetal Sheth) who ultimately reminds Miriam (Lisa Ray)-an oppressed and abused housewife, who has lost herself and her interests, in her \\"role\\"- that she the latter has the strength to stand on her own and be who she wants to be-personally and professionally. Both Sheetal Sheth and Lisa Ray do an incredible job of conveying their individual plights on screen-sometimes with little spoken word and an artistic journey that entrenches you into their quiet pain, caused by the situation. Their scenes are some of the most skillful, yearning and heart-wrenching I have ever seen-the book provides even more development of the inner life of both characters.<br /><br />The story is told with such subtle and emotional complexity that I've rarely seen on film or in a book. Many feelings are conveyed with glances, and descriptions, the score itself, and unsaid words, which make this film incredibly powerful. Although the film leaves much implied, I was completely captivated by the power of the performances of the leads, as well as the supporting cast. I learned a great deal about the time period, as well as how much courage each character had to find within him/herself to ultimately emerge independent and dignified.<br /><br />Amina is playful, bold, flirty and powerful and Miriam is reserved, curious and taken with Amina and all that she represents. There is passionate chemistry between the two female leads, who ultimately risk everything to grasp that which is most important-love for each other and for life and happiness.

0066620996|5.0|The research done by Jim Collins and his team to find out \\"Why Some Companies Make the Leap ... and Others Don't\\" to become \\"Good to Great\\" made me pay closer attention to the ideas presented in this book. Out of the many findings that were presented, I liked the following.  1. \\"Level 5 Leaders display a workmanlike diligence - more plow horse than show horse\\"  2. Get the right people on the bus and then figure out where to drive it.  3.  Figure out the single economic denominator.  4.  Start a \\"Stop Doing\\" list by budgeting to decide what to fully fund and what not to fund.  5. \\"Crawl, walk, run\\" to effectively implement new technology and not the other way around.  6. \\"Alignment principally follows from results and momentum, and not the other way around\\".  Overall this book gives many simple ideas to generate great results in any walk of  life. One particular sentence that grabbed my attention is \\" ...those who strive to turn good into great find the process no more painful or exhausting than those who settle for just letting things wallow along in mind-numbing mediocrity\\".  So, if its not going to be more painful (per the research) then why not go for greatness instead of settling for mediocrity.  Get this book and start out on your journey from good to great.
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|\\"Ghost in the Shell\\" is an intricate masterpiece of cyber-punk fiction and storytelling, successfully melding intriguing philosophical ideas with a coherent, well thought-out (albeit) confusing plot.<br /><br />Even more, it's a nightmarish vision of a society that's dominated by cyberspace and looking back now, is eerily prescient of today's computerized times. Many of the characters in the film are enhanced, someway or another by machines, to help them get the advantage in a vastly changing society.<br /><br />I'll avoid going real deep into the plot simply because there's a whole lot to grasp and even I got more than a little confused trying to follow it. The story is that a team of high-level government operatives are hot on the trail of a notorious computer hacker called the \\"Puppet Master,\\" who is wanted for various crimes in cyberspace and has taken a particularly fond interest in the team's tough, female cyborg leader.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, as with the stigmas surrounding Anime', \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" is not short of nudity and graphic violence. But it's far from being gratuitous, and does not slow down the movie at all.<br /><br />\\"Ghost in the Shell\\" was one of the first Anime' films to skillfully blend traditional drawn animation with computerized imagery. This helps to give the film a surreal, yet beautiful look. And the dialogue helps sometimes too, with helping to sort out the confusing plot and many of its mythical ideas about personal identity and human evolution.<br /><br />This film is also even more revered today, in 2004, since some of this film's core themes helped to develop the plot basis of the insanely popular \\"Matrix\\" films, and some scenes from \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" were even homaged to in the first \\"Matrix\\" movie. The Wachowski Brothers certainly do owe a lot to this movie for the success of their work in America.<br /><br />I think that to understand \\"Ghost in the Shell,\\" it would help to accept that Anime' is much more complex and daring than traditional American animation. Most Japanese animation films, like this one, \\"Akira,\\" or Mayazaki's \\"Spirited Away,\\" are on a level of sophistication that will never be matched in America.<br /><br />It has been said that the majority of American audiences would be afraid of Anime' because of the many stereotypes surrounding it, but that's why it's boundless - it's been given free reign to use those stigmas to its advantage in developing truly remarkable pieces of art that have gone largely ignored here in the U.S. \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" could very well be a mere reflection or a parable of a doomed society that's probably already accepted its dark fate. Most American animation would never touch up on this sort of subject matter.st Japanese animation films, like this one, \\"Akira,\\" or Mayazaki's \\"Spirited Away,\\" are on a level of sophistication that will never be matched in America.

0823003035|5.0|It seems that many of the reviewers of this book make reference to the time it takes to make a complete figure drawing using Ryder's \\"method\\", and that this figures in to their estimation of the book. For those of use not interested in spending 20 hours methodically refining the figure through a series of well defined steps, it seems easy to dismiss a book which advocates just that approach. However, this is unfair.    While Ryder does advocate a lengthy, involved and deliberate approach... his book has value beyond that. His explanations of the envelope, linear block in, contour construction, and shading are so fully developed and so well explained, that I learned a lot about figure drawing in general... things applicable to other approaches to figure drawing, and drawing in general.     I rate this book as VERY HIGH value. Don't be put off by the \\"method\\" that he teaches. All realists teach a method... which seems to be the specific form in which they integrate their knowledge. You have to extract the knowledge from their methodological approach in order to apply it to your own method... or to consider it apart from the method, if you don't think you want to work in that way.

B002BFBAUG|5.0|\\"Adventureland\\"  is the bittersweet story of James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg, \\"The Squid and the Whale\\") who, on graduating from college in 1987, looks forward to traveling through Europe that summer and attending Columbia University's grad school in the fall.  These plans are dashed when his parents (Wendy Malick, Jack Gilpin) inform him that his father was recently demoted and they no longer can afford to pay for the European trip. In addition, to help pay for grad school, he'll have to get a summer job in his home town of Pittsburgh.   Rebuffed by several potential employers because of his lack of experience, James finally gets a job at a local amusement park, Adventureland, operated by Paulette and Bobby (Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader).  Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds) is the park's maintenance man, a bit older than the college age employees, and rumored to have rubbed shoulders with show biz types.     Though marketed as a wild and freewheeling teen comedy, \\"Adventureland is actually a drama.  Sure, it has its funny moments, some based on the antics of \\"Saturday Night Live\\" veterans Wiig and Hader, others based on romantic awkwardness and James' journey from child to young adult.  Eisenberg has an endearing, puppy-dog screen persona that works perfectly here.  We immediately sympathize with him when his plans are suddenly thrown into turmoil, and are impressed at his ability to accept a bad break and make the best of a tough situation.      Kristen Stewart (\\"Twilight\\") plays James' love interest and Martin Starr (\\"Knocked Up\\") is the wisecracking nerd.  The soundtrack turns the clock back to 1980's Top 40, with music by The Cure, David Bowie, Crowded House, INXS, Lou Reed, and more.   Bonus extras include deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, commentary by director Greg Mottola and Eisenberg, and a digital copy of the film.  Exclusive on the Blu-ray release are \\"Welcome to Adventureland,\\" a collection of the park's commercials, orientation training video, and drug policy; and a satirical behind-the-scenes featurette.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I only needed that one word to describe it!<br /><br />I have been an MJ fan since I was six year old when BAD was released. This man has always fascinated me and I always thoroughly enjoyed his music.<br /><br />Following his untimely demise, I was watching youtube videos like crazy of MJ and I filled my Netflix queue with MJ DVDS. The first one I received was the Live in Bucharest one. I usually hold on to the DVDs I get from Netflix for just one night and then I mail it back the next day.<br /><br />However, I kept THIS ONE for over a week and I practically shed a tear when I mailed it. It was awesome!!! The crowd was energetic and Michael's moves just had me sitting there slack-jawed. My favorite performances were 'Human Nature', 'She's Out Of My Life', 'Working Day and Night', 'Beat It' and of course the start-off song 'JAM'. And in most of these songs he is NOT lip-synching. He is giving his all!!<br /><br />That same day I returned that DVD I went and brought my own. All MJ fans should own this!<br /><br />MJ at his finest!!
B0026ICAOS|4.0|\\"Children of the Corn\\"  is the 1984 adaptation of a Stephen King tale that turns children into monsters.  Following in the tradition of \\"The Bad Seed\\" and \\"Village of the Damned,\\" \\"Children of the Corn\\" sets out to shatter our notion that childhood is a time of innocence.  The opening scene grabs us right away.  In Gatlin, Nebraska, a small farming community, the good citizens follow church on Sunday with breakfast at the local coffee shop.  One morning, however, the town's children rise up against the adults, poisoning their coffee and slashing their throats in a violent, horrifying sequence.  Skip ahead three years.  Burt and Vicky (Peter Horton, Linda Hamilton) have a bad accident outside Gatlin and walk to town, searching for help.  But they find no adults.  Eventually, they discover that the children of Gatlin have formed a religious cult around an evil entity, \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows.\\"      Though far from a classic, this film has an enormous following and has inspired six sequels, five released directly to DVD.  Its appeal lies partly in the performances of the two young leads.  John Franklin plays Isaac, the nine-year-old prophet who organized the cult, and Courtney Gains portrays the odd-looking and unsettling Malachai.  Bonus extras include the featurette, \\"Welcome to Gatlin: The Sight and Sounds of Children Of the Corn;\\" an interview with Linda Hamilton; audio commentary by director Fritz Kiersch and actors John Franklin and Courtney Gains; and the documentary \\"Harvesting Horror: Children of the Corn.\\"

B001PA0FF4|5.0|Meryl Streep and Seymour Hoffman have not been paired recently, at least until this one came along. And what a combination it has proved to be in this gem of a movie. Doubt is the very foundation of the film, one which is attacked in sermons delivered by Hoffman's character. But Streep's character thrives on it. Herein lies the paradox that runs throughout the film. As viewers, we also find it very hard to guess who is right and who is wrong. The film masterfully creates that doubt in our minds and to the last second, that feeling lingers on.  The film skillfully portrays what doubts can do to people. The tension is almost palpable in some of the scenes of verbal confrontations between the two lead characters.   You buy this blu ray essentially for the film, not as a demo material. The sound too is dialogue driven, so do not expect much from the surround channels. That said, the blu-ray is a solid presentation. The photography is excellent, though it is mostly an `indoor' movie. But one outdoor scene is outstanding - the conversation between the mother of one of the altar boys and Streep's character. That is one of the emotional high points of the film, without a doubt.  Have no doubt about this movie - it delivers. If you are looking for some serious drama, there is little doubt that Doubt is the right movie. It is a film that stays in your mind long after the end credits roll and you may want to watch it a second or third time to comprehend all the subtle nuances. The title is simple, but the story is complex and in the context of certain events in the recent past, chillingly real. This is one Doubt you may want to cherish.
B00008LKDY|1.0|Be careful when you receive the box. The CD and SACD looks quite the same.  The two mentions \\"multi-ch\\". Of course a cd is stereo and can't be multichannel !  Look for the small sacd logo, it is written on the SACD box.  As I write this, you can't see my point on the picture on this page. The picture was somewhat zoomed.  I rate it only 1 star, so you'll have more chance to read this.  You can't blame anyone on this, the wrong mention \\"multi-ch\\" on (some?) cd version can be confusing for everyone.

0061537969|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I am not a big dog lover or race fan. However, that in no way affects how much I love this book. Be warned though, it is very sad at times and sometimes you'll be so mad that you don't want to read anymore for fear that you'll take your anger out on some innocent bystander. I'll be totally honest, it takes alot to make me cry, and even though I didn't cry, my eyes did swell up and I had to take a deep breath and tell myself it's only a book. But, rest assured, things work out in the end. No other book I have ever read has stirred up my emotions as much as this one. Even all the race jargon throughout the book is not a bore because it really helps tell the story (without giving too much away, the dog watches alot of racing films and that's why he knows so much about it). Anyways, stop reading this review and go buy this book right now. You won't regret it!
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This movie was a breath of fresh air to me. Movies have become so predictable and commercial and many lack vision and passion. This movie does not!

1566196043|5.0|I remember reading various Sherlock Holmes tales when I was a child and I had fond memories of the stories.  I was not very interested in the genre of \\"mystery\\" as a child and the same is true now, except for Doyle's work.  As an adult, though, I have never delved deeply into the material, thus I went to my local books store and picked up the complete works in an inexpensive leather bound edition.  Now anyone who is a bibliophile will know that those \\"leather\\" editions they make of the classics in the major chain stores are nothing compared to a hand bound leather book.  However, for a relatively low price this is a beautiful edition to pick up, as it only cost me twenty dollars.  For over eleven hundred pages worth of stories, I would say that's quite a bargain.<br /><br />The complete works appears to be quite a daunting task.  And it is, I am not a fast reader and it took me months to finish this.  Doyle's material feels so much fuller to read as an adult than as a child.  So if you ever grew up with the Young Adult versions of any of Doyle's then I highly recommend you delve into the full text.  The stories have a much fuller feel than the ones I remember as a child.  It is interesting to reflect that one of my favorites when I was younger was \\"The Hound of the Baskerville's\\".  Upon reading the story in full, I found I didn't like it as much.  In fact I wasn't as taken by Doyle's full novels very much.  I think he sets them up in a strange way from what I'm used to.  Basically each novel is setup into two parts.  The first part has Sherlock trying to solve some mystery.  By the end of this first section you usually find the culprit, but the second section is all the background past of the culprit.  It's an interesting setup, but I found my interest wane without having Sherlock around.  This is unfortunate, because the stories weren't bad, but they weren't what I wanted.  At least that's the best I can explain.<br /><br />For me Doyle shined in the form of short stories.  These were by far my favorite throughout the book and I simply couldn't get enough of them.  Based on the fact that Doyle kept having to revive the Holmes character throughout his writing career, it would appear the general public was little different from myself.  It's interesting to read these late 19th century stories and see them discuss things like science and realize how far things have come.  For example it is constantly remarked that the size of ones head would determine a person's intelligence.  This is totally false, but clearly seemed logical back then.  In the 21st century it does wind up sounding quite amusing.  One thing I must commend Doyle for is keeping superstitious nonsense or religious explanations out of any of the solutions.  I think that's one of the reasons I liked a lot of the stories, they try to stick to logic and scientific reasoning (minus the ape serum story).  It actually makes me wonder how much influence this type of work had on things like CSI.<br /><br />There is one flaw with this particular edition of the book.  I found the editing to be extremely lazy.  Now, I don't expect to get an eleven hundred page book and have it be typo free.  Usually I'll come across one or two in any book I have.  However, the nature of the typos in this edition, I feel, are quite inexcusable.  For example when reading certain sections I will find the word \\"let\\".  But that is not what is printed.  Instead the symbol for British Pounds currency is displayed followed by the letter \\"t\\".  This British Pounds symbol showed up numerous times, and not just in \\"let\\".  The first time it was merely comical, the next four were quite annoying.  These aren't the only typos I found and the typos are more numerous towards the end of the book.  It is as if the book was edited for the first half only.  I wouldn't say it was the worst editing I've ever seen, but it was frustrating whenever I ran into the problems, and no one likes their reading disrupted.<br /><br />Despite the typos, I still love this book.  I like the edition and the attempt at an old world publication aesthetic.  I think this really adds to the atmosphere of the text and its setting.  Overall, I would recommend this edition, but beware of some frustrating typos here and there.  They are decently easy to get over, since the content is so superb.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5love this book.  I like the edition and the attempt at an old world publication aesthetic.

B001OQCV2Y|5.0|Though it has been in the works for over a decade, \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" couldn't have been released at a better time for Tarantino's career. After the relatively restrained and \\"mature\\" \\"Jackie Brown,\\" \\"Kill Bill\\" represented a culmination of Tarantino's self-conscious, postmodern style. While his earlier films were still crime flicks at heart, \\"Kill Bill\\" had no core at all and is a total pastiche, integrating crime, westerns, thriller and martial arts elements without privileging any one style or having even the tiniest interest in reality. Attempting to top \\"Kill Bill\\" for sheer audacity and scope would be foolish but, at the same time, making another \\"Jackie Brown\\" would seem a little too plain and reiterative at this moment. Tarantino takes the third choice of making essentially the same sort of film he always had, but finally moving it from and contemporary setting and integrating a largely new set of influences. The trademarks are all present, and while the harsher critics will say it's still the same vile stew, it should be a bit fresher for those with a taste for the style. This has apparently worked for critics (who largely like it, though I expected a backlash), and I should imagine it will work for fans in the general public.<br /><br />The early ads (inaccurately) made \\"Basterds\\" look like a rare modern war/adventure film ala \\"The Dirty Dozen,\\" where a ruthless Jewish-American squad and their commander Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) take vengeance on the Nazis. As usual, these titular figures are just one element of many, and we also follow the exploits \\"The Jew Hunter\\" Col. Landa (Christoph Waltz), an SS officer who is sent to France to operate, and French Jew Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), a young woman who lost her family and barely escaped death at Landa's hand, and who later rides out the war in secret while running a Parisian movie theater. After a few chapters of introducing the characters, these figures all converge on Dreyfus's theater in June 1944, which will host the premiere of \\"A Nation's Pride,\\" a Nazi propaganda film celebrating Fredrick Zoller, a German war hero who is infatuated with Dreyfus. The premier (with Landa as head of security) will be attended by the German brass, which inspires the Allies to call on the Basterds and British Lt. Archie Hickox (Michael Fassbender) to go undercover and destroy the theater, while Dreyfus plans her own special welcome for the Nazis.<br /><br />Though that description may sound plot heavy, the film is still rooted in Tarantino's trademark palaver-heavy style. And make no mistake, after the missteps in \\"Death Proof,\\" Tarantino's lengthy exchanges shine consistently once more. (And are, again, suddenly and gruesomely interrupted by graphic violence.) Overall, the dialogue is somewhat more restrained than it has been in Tarantino's post-\\"Reservoir Dogs\\" work, with a bit less discussion of popular culture, and what is there (generally German cinema of the era) is relevant to the plot. More substantially, while Tarantino's old dialogue was extremely entertaining, he generates more authentic drama this time around. \\"Basterds\\" unleashes this approach immediately, opening with a gentle, smiling interrogation of a French farmer by the charming Landa. Even better is the encounter between the Hickox/the Basterds and Bridget von Hammersmark (an unconscionably gorgeous Diane Kruger), a German actress-turned-spy who has unwisely chosen a German-crowded tavern to convene in, resulting in a slow burn, probing interrogation (under the guise of conversation) of the undercover Hickox by a Gestapo Major. The latter scene is a high point in Tarantino's oeuvre, as it slowly builds and peaks, effortlessly keeping the viewer off balance. Relatedly, the film as a whole displays Tarantino's peerless ability to juxtapose drama, horror and humor in surprising and always entertaining ways. I'm sure his critics will continue to be unimpressed, but the initiated will likely take these transitions with ease.<br /><br />As usual, in spite of his surreal, unbelievable style, Tarantino generates some intriguing, memorable characters. There is already Oscar hype for Waltz as Col. Landa. Landa cleverly plays with the traditional portrayal of the jackbooted SS officer. Instead of being controlled and formal or even conventionally charming, Waltz is instead a little goofy-looking with bad teeth, a slightly fey voice and an overly animated style. While lesser films would more frequently break with Landa's disarming style, \\"Basterds\\" holds back, keeping his façade of pleasantness up as long and as fully as possible. Pitt's Aldo Raine is also enjoyable. He's a shallow, one-note character, to be sure, but Pitt clearly has a lot of fun with him and he isn't given so much screen time as to wear out his welcome. Finally we have the lovely Laurent as Shosanna, who gives the film a certain amount of heart inside of all the absurdity. The performances are uniformly strong as well and are, as with most things in a Tarantino film, over the top without becoming outright parody. This is best exemplified in the taciturn, ever-scowling Til Schweiger as Stiglitz, an Austrian Jew who slaughtered German officers as an enlisted man before being adopted by the Basterds, and whose relentless intensity falls just short of ludicrous. (Schweiger would best be described as Bronson-esque.)<br /><br />It goes without saying that the technical credits are impeccable and the soundtrack (lifted from other films and Morricone in particular) is always enjoyable. It doesn't have quite the level of technical flash of some of his earlier films, but Tarantino can still pull out all of the stops when he wants to, best illustrated in our arrival at the premiere, set to Bowie's \\"Cat People\\" track and highlighted by some elegant, prowling shots of the theater.<br /><br />The ending is a source of controversy, and will no doubt be so for sometime. Frankly, I'm a bit baffled that so many were surprised by it. Anything else would've been too small or anticlimactic. Remember, the \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is about film, not about WWII, and in film you can end it however you want. Check it out.<br /><br />Grade: AAs usual, in spite of his surreal, unbelievable style, Tarantino generates some intriguing, memorable characters. There is already Oscar hype for Waltz as Col. Landa.

It's stunning how powerfully effecting are the acoustic numbers \\"Friends\\", \\"Gallows Pole\\", \\"Tangerine\\", \\"That's The Way\\", and \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\". By softening their attack they manage to get even deeper, reaching a part of my psyche that I was a stranger to. They seem to be calling me back to a distant realm that I wandered from a long, long time ago... but where? I guess we are all Immigrants.
0307460444|5.0|I haven't tried all the recipes yet but the ones I have tried have turned out beautifully.  I have Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook and I get similar results.  The recipes have obviously been triple tested because they work for me everytime.  I love that I can approach a recipe and know that the end product will turn out exactly as expected and I haven't wasted my time, money or ingredients.  I would like to say that this book is fairly small and doesn't stay open unless it's on a book stand or there's some holding down the pages but other than that small detail it's a perfect cupcake book.
B000002J0B|5.0|\\"The Song Remains The Same\\", which spectacularly opens the disc with a locomotive beat and blazing, layered guitars, is the highest energy song on the album. It then immediately slows to a near crawl with \\"The Rain Song\\", a lush romancer that drips with desire. \\"Over The Hills and Far Away\\" is the only guitar song I learned after 2 years of trying. It's a multi tempo classic that rates with the much-vaunted \\"Stairway To Heaven\\". \\"The Crunge\\" is James Brown if he were just a little more Celtic. \\"Dancing Days\\" is an odd number with an insistently quirky riff and jerky syncopation. Not one of my favorites, but strangely haunting and very popular on the radio. On a Zeppelin tribute album \\"Stone Temple Pilots\\" did a cover of this one that's just as spastic. \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" was always on the jukebox at the \\"Canteen\\", my high school burger hangout joint. It's a reggae groove with a funky accent. Good memories. If we have to pick favorites, I say \\"No Quarter\\" is a better song than \\"Kashmir\\", which had already been overplayed 25 years ago. These both are more novelty songs than true examples of Zep's sound, but they do take you on exotic journeys, and they rock very hard.  John Paul Jones' keyboard work on \\"No Quarter\\" is just epic. Finally, \\"The Ocean\\" is a grand gorgeous tribute to the biggest waters, with shifting tempos and funkafied riffs. It's all Zep so what's the problem?...
B001AEF6BI|5.0|This is a Classic 80's film. Including the key members of the Rat Pack. A good buy.
B000002JSN|5.0|There's Sooo much good, Great stuff here it's just ridiculous. \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" is one of the all time greatest opening riffs, up there with Beethoven and Bach. Maybe higher. The epics \\"In My Time of Dying\\" and \\"In The Light\\" are thrilling sonic symphonies thanks to Bonham's incredible beats. There's just so much here. The novelty gem \\"Kashmir\\" and its companion \\"Ten Years Gone\\" honor Eastern motifs, and \\"Boogie With Stu\\", \\"Black Country Women\\", and \\"Sick Again\\" are nods to that American Music that got 'em started. \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" is a fine taste of Celtic folk. \\"Custard Pie\\" is just good hard rock and \\"The Rover\\" could be Black Sabbath, Paranoid era. \\"Night Flight\\" really has great tempo changes, as it floats and bobs along. Throughout the album there's a feeling of reaching out and exploring, but at the same time extreme confidence. If \\"Kashmir\\" wasn't on Classic Rock Radio every 10 seconds I might still enjoy it. Ok, dammit, I still enjoy it.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. I manage to watch it at least once or twice a year. Great price too.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Page just tears this up! And Bonham is a MONSTER on even the \\"lesser\\" tracks. No accounting for taste - \\"Candy Store Rock\\" is brilliant. It's so different from anything I've ever heard from any other band or even from Zep, yet it's a faithful classic rock 'n roll tribute. I used to hear it all the time on the jukebox at the \\"Canteen\\", my high school burger shop hangout joint. It made me fee like \\"Happy Days\\", but on acid. And it totally boosted my pinball scores.<br /><br />\\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is without question one of their finest, most spectacular creations. Blistering guitar wizardry and mind bending rhythm work. A towering triumph. Then, there's the seemingly familiar sounding song, the crawling blues \\"Tea For One.\\" But, after a few minutes, it becomes completely unique and powerful. \\"For Your Life\\", \\"Royal Orleans\\", and \\"Hots On For Nowhere\\" are all three somewhat similar mid tempo rockers, and so I re-order the CD or mp3s to play them together. They make a tremendous medley, each one driven by Bonham's awesome pounding textures. Absolutely excellent stop-and-start rhythm and syncopation. Which leads to \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" which just happens to have all these qualities and more packed into a phenomenal whole-band workout. It just rips and tears like a thresher.<br /><br />It might have been a rushed, compromised project, but Presence is a sonic shock wave.

The DVD had a thick layer of dirt/dust, it was disgusting.  I don't even know how a DVD can look like that.  It would have been easy for the owner to take a quick wipe to it so the buyer (me) didn't have to deal with that.  Gross.      But unexpectedly the DVD did work...so...I'm not that mad.
6305910340|3.0|I'm very surprised that no one commented on what the studio has done to this picture in the DVD release: The \\"widescreen\\" aspect ratio is achieved by taking the pan-and-scan version of the movie and lopping off the top and bottom to make the 4:3 aspect ratio into 16:9 (1.85:1).  This means you see even less of the frame than in the VHS version!  Thankfully, this practice is being abandoned by the movie studios.  Let's hope this terrific movie gets a proper re-release on DVD soon.

B00001U03Q|3.0|Once Eric Clapton broke his Polyrgram contract and renegotiate with Warners, he began a slow descent into middle-of-the-road album rock and popular ballads. That's what you'll find on this single disc set. There are a couple bona-fide hits here in the Babyface (?!?) produced \\"Change The World\\" and the intensely personal \\"Tears In Heaven.\\" You also get the Grammy Winning acoustic take on \\"[[ASIN:B000002MFE Layla]].\\" What's left are a few minor hits (\\"Forever Man,\\" \\"It's In The Way That You Use It\\") and a bunch of factory ready slick tunes that bring none of the guitar legend prowess that made Clapton's name.<br /><br />That's not to say this is bad stuff. Clapton as a balladeer is still a solid bet, but it makes \\"Clapton Chronicles\\" a bit lopsided. In fact, only the low-key \\"River Of Tears\\" seems to find Clapton driving himself away from the staid or stoic hitmaker of the bulk of this CD. Why not throw a track or two from [[ASIN:B000002MTU From the Cradle]] or the title track from [[ASIN:B00004THAY Riding with the King?]] It would have added some spark to an anthology that otherwise seems destined to be used for background music. If you want to splurge an extra couple of bucks, the [[ASIN:B000UAE8CQ Complete Clapton]] is a much better comp.

The guy who is the brains behind the guitar work (Tosin Abasi) is a musical genius - a virtuoso - yet in interviews I've read online he seems to downplay his skills to a degree.  This is the kind of album that you can tell is good right away, but takes you a few listens to start fully appreciating it, and I keep playing it over and over.  I'm eager to see what else Tosin does.  Fans of melodic death metal, psychedelic / space rock, or off-timing will definitely enjoy this.  It's epic mind-metal.

1563890119|5.0|I have just begun a re-reading of all of the Sandman volumes.  I'm purchasing the current printings of the standalone volumes after having made what I now consider a mistake.  I had gotten rid of my earlier Sandman books to buy the volumes in THE ABSOLUTE SANDMAN series.  Big mistake, with emphasis on \\"big.\\"  I found that the volumes were, while quite beautiful, simply too heavy to use.  They were so heavy that I could not find a comfortable way to read them.  So, after having sold my original individual volumes so I could buy the larger collections, I sold the first two ABSOLUTE SANDMAN books so I could go back and get the newer editions of what I had previously gotten rid of.  The result is that I've ended up buying Sandman three times.  What I wish Vertigo had done was produce volumes that corresponded precisely to each individual original volume.  I loved how great the pages in the ABSOLUTE SANDMAN looked, but it simply wasn't practical to use.<br /><br />The Sandman series definitely got better as it went along, but even so it started marvelously.  I had forgotten some of the things in this first volume, like the very brief appearance of J'onn J'onzz, which had completely escaped my memory.  As I remembered it John Considine had not played as big a role as he did.  Gaiman started off definitely wanting to locate the book in the DC universe.  What we most love about the Sandman series, however, are the things that Gaiman brought to it.<br /><br />I loved this volume, but it really takes off for me with \\"A Death in the Family,\\" in which we meet the Sandman's sister Death for the first time.  I'm quite excited about getting back to the later volumes.  Without any question, this is, along with FABLES, my favorite long series ever created.

0470185317|5.0|I have spent many years amassing a collection of every book on FPGA on the market! Ok, maybe that's pushing it...However, compared to what most books lack in practical examples, this one I find is a complete GEM! From the beginning to the end it keeps you going with interesting, real world examples of what can be done with a Digilent Spartan Starter Kit. The author, Prof. P. Chu does an excellent job at progressivelly building your understanding of FPGA logic design, through a series of chapters that gradually take you to the more advanced stages of design in easily comprehensible lessons that require more elevated skills as one approaches the end chapters. The beauty of this book is that it uses the lessons learned prior to take you to the next level. I've used Prof. Chu's samples and interfaced them with a PIC and ARM9 development boards respectivelly, just to spice in some more fun and excitement. I may be considering launching a free site for the microcontroller sample code interfacing to his functional FPGA examples with his prior consent! There are lessons on dealing with numbers, such as the illusive negative integers and floats represented in binary logic. These are not borring discussions. They are well explained and straight to the point, complete with test benches and some of them can even be ran in the Xilinx simulator. The muxing example for LEDs should be the starting point of all experiments. It's that useful! The chapter on circular buffers is alone worth the price of the book! The memory interfacing and the VGA interfacing are priceless chapters as well! Try looking at a Xilinx sample for memory interfacing! PHEW... I cannot rave enough about the amount of work he has put into this...This is not a lazy approach to book writing! It's methodical, complete, well illustrated and there are samples included and they all work as described in the book! If you are new to FPGA, this book may be the top stepping stone you're after! It should be on everybody'sbook shelf who deals with FPGA logic design and I'm considering buying another one, just in case I loose the first one...Yes, it's that good! Brilliant work Prof. Chu, please keep em' going! It's people like yourself that make VHDL learning fun and exciting again!

B00260HH3K|5.0|As a fan of the Dragonball franchise for over 10 years this was a long time coming. Unlike the other live-action films where you already have to be engrossed in the franchise to understand it, DB: Evolution takes you back to the beginning of the franchise and makes you get emotional invested with the characters. I'm hoping Justin Chatwin reprises his role in sequel(s) despite some other fanboys suggest. The extras are what you expect (gag reels, deleted scenes, interviews and behind-the-scenes). Unfortunely, no audio commmentary by the actors or creators of the Dragonball franchise was a disappointment. Perhaps in the sequel they will have a 2-disc special edition with the history of the franchise (please!!!). Hopefully this will be a four-part series leading to the end of the Cell Games which would be a fitting end to the series. This is a buy for any fan of the franchise or anybody who likes cool fight scenes in general.

B002AT4KA0|3.0|While I liked the original crew from the first movie and a lot of the action, something about this fourth entry in the series makes me want to watch the first one instead.<br /><br />Maybe it's some of the absurd notions (a container truck pulling four fully loaded fuel trailers? c'mon...) or the almost stupid spoon feeding (which criminal is the tuner? Let's see, regular car, regular car, regular car, tuned up car with illegal mods, regular car...oh, how about the tuned car?) but something about this movie made me hate it more than the first.<br /><br />After all, you can't say it's because the actors were different...or the director...or the locale...or the cars...pretty much the same thing going on here. Maybe it's a sign that cookie-cutter movie making isn't entertainment or at least it's not something that'll excite you as much as the racing usually does.<br /><br />The second movie was ridiculously asinine. The third (Tokyo Drift) was definitely fun though that was largely because the drifting was crazy. But, in the end, the first movie had all sorts of things going for it.<br /><br />Now, that doesn't mean you won't get something out of this movie. I'm saying you need to decide where your loyalties are. If you loved the first movie more than the last two, then you're safe...buy it and enjoy. If you liked the other two as well, then coming back to this one might not be the homecoming you're expecting. Still, something relatively new and in the F&F universe is better than nothing at all.

B0024FADAQ|3.0|What can I say? Yes, when this movie came out the art of CG graphics in movies was in its infancy. Heck, if you saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan you saw one of the first uses of computer graphics in a major motion picture (the Genesis sequence) produced by the people who would become Pixar. Those graphics actually looked a tad better than these which are closer to those you might have seen in Tron.    So, if you're really into modern CG and Sci Fi, you might have to gird your loins prior to seeing some of the graphics in this movie. For the time, though, the CG was pretty damned advanced. In a way, this film was a sort of test bed for what you could do without physical models back then. The funny thing is they actually did it more by accident than it being the intention from the inception of the movie.    That said, once you get past just how dated the CG is, you'll find a nice little story about a kid in the middle of nowhere finding a purpose he always thought he had but couldn't seem to find. It's a classic story that's even touched on by the characters in the movie (the Excalibur test). As much as I harp on the CG, I still enjoyed the story after all these years. This is, after all, one of those stories that I wanted to come true. The idea of being the \\"savior of the galaxy\\" isn't far from a lot of Sci Fi fanboy's dreams as is being picked up off Earth and dropped into a modern star fighter. And, the story is a fun little ride.    The extras on the disk aren't anything extra special but there is a nice behind the scenes featurette that gives you a sense for how much they were pushing the envelope at the time. I sort of expected more for a 25th anniversary edition but you know how the movies studios love to market the hell out of very little.     If you can get it on sale for $15 or less and you always wanted to be a starfighter pilot, then grab this sucker and have some fun.
1591841992|5.0|Have you ever wrestled with a subject that was hard to understand or explain? Maybe it was a concept in school, a project at work, or even a matter of theology. Visual thinking may have been just the tool you needed.<br /><br />Dan Roam introduces us to visual thinking in this excellent little book. Say goodbye to clumsy PowerPoint slides, complicated spreadsheets, and endless bullet point lists. It's time to return to the good old-fashioned pen and paper or whiteboard. Roam opens with a series of intriguing questions:<br /><br />  \\"What if there was a way to more quickly look at problems, more intuitively understand them, more confidently address them, and more rapidly convey to others what we've discovered? What if there was a way to make business problem solving more efficient, more effective, and - as much as I hate to say it - perhaps even a bit more fun? There is. It's called visual thinking, and it's what this book is all about: solving problems with pictures (p. 3).\\"<br /><br />The author spends the first half of his book introducing several important principles: 3 Basic Visual Thinking Tools: your eyes, your mind's eye, and hand-eye coordination; 4 Steps in the Visual Thinking Process: look, see, imagine, and show; 5 Questions that help open our mind's eye: the SQVID method; and 6 Ways we see and show ideas: who/what, how much, where, when, how, and why.<br /><br />In the second half of his book, Roam gets practical. He applies all these principles of visualization to an extended case study of a fictitious software development company called SAX Inc. The book bogs down a little at this point, but it's important for him to carry out the whole process from beginning to end.<br /><br />For me, the most helpful part of the book was the SQVID (pronounced \\"squid\\") method. It's an acronym Roam created to show ten different ways of thinking about a subject: Simple vs. Elaborate; Qualitative vs. Quantitative; Vision vs. Execution; Individual vs. Comparison; and Change vs. As Is (The Greek letter Delta is the symbol for Change). Amazingly, by thinking of an idea in these ten different ways, your imagination is stretched and your mind's eye is trained to look in whole new directions. Both the left and right hemisphere of your brain are exercised.<br /><br />Visual thinking is a vital principle for both learning and teaching, and I can't think of any better place to start learning about the subject than The Back of the Napkin.is the symbol for Change).

B00243FQFA|4.0|As a fan of the Stargate franchise I was sorry to see Atlantis come to a close. The final season features a cast with fine on-screen chemistry that have settled comfortably into their characters, good production values and most importantly, engaging and interesting stories.     The main characters hit their stride in Season 5. Joe Flanigan does outstanding work as John Sheppard, particularly in the episode \\"Vegas\\". Jason Momoa, Rachel Luttrell and David Hewlett are always fun and interesting to watch. I love Amanda Tapping, so I was ready to hate Robert Picardo as the commander, but he developed Mr. Woolsey into a complex and interesting character.    Lots of strong performances from the supporting cast in Season 5, particularly Kavan Smith as Major Loren and Sharon Taylor as Amelia Banks. Jewel Staite is delightful as Doctor Keller, (and she's darn cute). Connor Trineer is wonderfully creepy as Michael, and David Nykl continues his excellent work as Dr. Zelenka. It was great to see Paul McGillion come back at least briefly as Dr. Beckett.    All of the major story lines are satisfyingly wrapped up without feeling hurried, and without the self indulgence that can ruin a final season. The DVD set is well packaged; I liked the \\"thin-pak\\" boxes made of recycled plastic. Disc navigation is adequate, but there are far too many warning screens, trailers and promos to wade through when you load a disk.     Overall, this is quality science fiction and I congratulate everyone involved for their hard work and dedication. I'm looking forward to a feature length movie or three!
B000B5XOY8|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for my all time favorite movie to get the proper DVD treatment & at long last its here!! Finally, commentary from Tim Burton plus numerous, exhaustive documentaries covering everything from behind the scenes of the film to the Batman mythology, new interviews w/ cast, crew, & the long grueling road it took to get Batman on the big screen. And lastly the blockbuster that it was.
0307454541|5.0|In my xenophobic naivity I pictured this book as the kind only critics could like.  Bergman on paper, loaded with symbolism and semiotics.  Was I wrong.  This is an exciting, well written book and Liz Salander is not only the most interesting female character I've encountered in crime fiction, she is the most interesting character period I've encountered.  I wonder if they could make a movie of this book but who could play Ms Salander besides Hollywood would either tone her down or turn the book into another Basic Instinct.  Have just started the sequel and feel deprived that there won't be another dozen to follow.

0439023483|5.0|Scanning through amazon, i came across this book, read the plot synopsis and reviews and had to run out and buy it right away.  Read through it in a 24 hour period.  It was amazing and i didn't want to put it down.  So excited I don't have to wait long for the sequel and I couldn't help but think of this book as a movie while i was reading.  Heard it is coming out in 2011, couldn't find any other news on the movie though.  I recommended this book to everyone and even sent it out to my brother as soon as i was finished!

There are more complete live Rory Gallagher CDs out there such as Live at Montreux, Stage Struck and Live in Europe are also good. But for sheer passion and intensity Nothing compares to Irsh Tour 74.  Great early song selection(remember it was recorded early in the G-Mans career) and this CD has the most intense version of Walk on Hot Coals ever recorded(worth the price of admission alone)!
B000LAZDQA|1.0|This film is boring with no plot or point, it is primarily a gay film that would be a good method of showing anyone why a gay lifestyle sucks. The actors are bad and unattractive, even the sex scenes are boring and antierotic. I watched it once and threw it away. They didn't even have a script to shoot, they made it up as they went along -- and it looks like it. Don't waste your time, unless you are gay and love boring films.
0316044695|5.0|I simply cannot understand how someone could read this book and be turned off by the politics -- whether or not you agree with Mr. Luttrel's positions. These guys are warriors for our country, folks, so they're going to have strongly patriotic views. So if you're a Bush hater and simply can't accept that someone actually looks up to the man (both of them, actually), suck it up and read it for what it tells you about Marcus Luttrell. Is patriotism that out of fashion? I've read a lot of reviews here saying \\"gee, great story, but cluttered with patriotism and pro-Bush views.\\" Perhaps the patriotism is the point, folks. And by the way, the book doesn't glorify killing at all, it simply accepts it as what warriors sometimes/often have to do. That the SEALS are better at it than anyone else is their glory and for them to be proud of, not something for us to disparage. The central act of the book, that may -- or may not -- have cost the SEALS their lives -- was a decision NOT to kill three Afghan goat herders. We should all pray that there are more men like Mr. Luttrell out there and that they find their way into the ranks of the SEALS to defend us when we need it.

1416972242|4.0|Honestly, I thought this book was a solid follow up to City of Bone. I liked it a lot; the prose was good, the plot and the world sucked me in and kept me fascinated. I thought the love-triangle was real; it wasn't all cherry-pie and roses.    Some of the criticism for this comes about because of the incestuous tones of the triangle; but what people seem to forget, is that Clary and Jace have JUST found out that they are siblings; before that, they were on the fast track to a hot and heavy relationship. Something chemical like that does not just stop; even if its inappropriate, and i prefer the direction she took with it rather then the more mary-sue-esq mentioning that all their feelings had dried up as soon as they found out they were siblings. To me, it made the characters much more real.    All in all, it was a great read; I'd recommend it to anyone.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|I didn't have feelings about MJ one way or the other until after his death.  However living near Neverland and where the trial was held, we heard all about it on the nightly news.  One of the first things I was able to get to explore more about this engmatic man was this DVD.  I was thrilled and enchanted with it's contents and, as I now realize, I was spoiled by viewing this DVD before the other concert or documentary footage. This showcases MJ fabulously and gives the uneducated a glimpse into how many people adored this man and to what lengths they would go to see hin in concert.  If, you are like me, please, especially if you only have a limited amount of money to spend, buy this DVD over the others.  This DVD is all concert footage.  If you want more factual, or MTV-like videos then this one is not for you.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Funny, thought provoking, and oh so captivating.  McDougall takes on a lot in this treatise on why and how we run.

This is investigative writing at its best.  Can't wait for more from him!

0439023491|5.0|This review is spoiler-free, but I recommend that you do not read it unless you have read The Hunger Games!<br /><br />Catching Fire picks up a few months after Katniss and Peeta return home to District 12 with fame and riches. They are both happy to have survived and brought wealth to their District, but barely speak to each other anymore, except when the cameras come around to keep up the ruse that they are madly in love. Katniss is horrified to discover that her victory has become a symbol of resistance, and finds herself unable to do anything about it. She watches helplessly as violence is inflicted on innocent people, all the while kept under the thumb of the president of Panem. She begins to wonder if there is life outside of oppressive Panem, but doesn't have time to think about it for long, because her worst nightmares are about to be brought to life.<br /><br />Catching Fire is all that it promises to be and more. Fans of The Hunger Games will devour this second, intense installment. Suzanne Collins begins by showing readers life for Katniss and Peeta once they return home, brings back all the memorable and good characters from the first book, and works at developing her characters and revealing how they act while under extreme pressure. Despite her fame, uncertainty, and heavy conscience, Katniss is still tough as nails, fiercely protective of those she loves, and as resourceful as ever. There is one stretch of the book that moves slowly, but readers won't mind too much once Collins drops her first bombshell (figuratively speaking, of course) in the form of an unexpected plot twist, which will overwhelm readers with a flurry of questions and what-ifs, and the book speeds up once more. From then on out, the book is a heart pounding, exhilarating, and even agonizing race to the climax and ending that will leave readers desperate for more. Catching Fire is an intricate web of lies and secrecy, injustice and rebellion, and danger and hope that will keep readers dreaming long after the final page.<br /><br />Cover Comments: I like the design concept for The Hunger Games trilogy. The mockingjay on the front is a neat touch, as it does have significance in the book. It's simple, but straightforward. The orange-ish red color is pretty awesome too! Great, great cover!s dreaming long after the final page.<br /><br />Cover Comments: I like the design concept for The Hunger Games trilogy.

1846140064|1.0|I have not read her book but I know this.   first of all, the money sent almost never gets to Africa. There is all kinds of deduction done to it from the beginning by the people giving it (they send they own 'expert', they tell you exactly what to do with the money which in most case is not what the people need,  they do or control a big part of the contracts).  The money is almost all gone, then comes the dictator and his people who take over the mere little that is left. And they put it in they own account in the same bank in europe or USA. In a lot of case the project does not even start. In most of the cases for instance for a road they might dig here and there, pour some cement here and there and the project stop.  Bottom, line the money stays where it originated.

B001AQR39O|5.0|This show gives me a serious broner (see Californication Season 1). I've loved Duchovny's deadpan style ever since he played a cross-dressing FBI agent on Twin Peaks. And Callum Keith Rennie (the creepy Leoben from Battlestar Galactica) shows that he's got great comedic timing. It was also cool to see Madchen Amick (another Twin Peaks cast member). Best writing on TV right now. Totally addictive. The scene with Cokie Smurf and Runkle sporting nothing but his undies and a greasy crab bib was outrageously funny.

Many thanks to the author.
B002EWD08Q|3.0|Its fine when a genuinely talented band decides to change-up its sound.  \\"Why not?\\" I am sure they said when walking into the studio to record these tracks.  Unfortunately the tracks are almost entirely devoid of energy or build. There's not a stand-out track here and I have played the tracks over and over again.  None of the tracks are terrible but they arent memorable either.  That's a problem.      There's nothing wrong with going for a denser, louder, slower sound (that's essentially what they did on all of the tracks), but there's no build or drama either.   Bassy drums are placed up front in all of the tracks and I _really_ wonder how most of these tracks would have sounded with the drum track pushed back, wayyyyyyy back.  All I seem to be hearing are those drums and a lazy bassline.  'Propeller' has some heft, which presumably is why it is the first track.      Here's my beef: AC made lots of B-sides in the last 3 years that were several slower tracks and they were awesome. 505 is a great track and the live version is even better. But these new tracks just sit there.      They are a talented band, but this CD if it were their debut CD? It would have disappeared in a heartbeat and no one would known who the band was. There's plenty of reasons to hope their next CD will be better.
1591391105|2.0|There is some good material here. There is some sound theory here. Then there is about 150 pages of padding, fluff, and flower petals. \\"Be adaptable\\" is one way to frame the main theme of the book. Okay. Got it. I'm adaptable. Now what? Wait, I have another 100 pages of \\"Be adaptable\\".<br />Note to the author: Nameless \\"Case Studies\\" aren't \\"Case Studies\\". They are fables. If you are telling the truth, prove your truth.<br /><br />All in all this book is dull as aluminum cutlery, and dry as as a cracker. If you are looking for the \\"Strategy\\" the book seems to promise, you will be left with your hand out.

0385342020|5.0|I have never read anything by Sophie Kinsella before, but was drawn to this novel by the premise.  Being a classic film buff, the entire time I was reading it I kept envisioning it in my head as a 1930s or 1940s movie.  To me it has all the charm of \\"Blithe Spirit\\" or \\"Topper\\" and I could clearly see Sadie as the free-spirited ghost flitting about in her Twenties' garb, refusing to leave until she had her precious necklace, much to the dismay of her earthbound great-niece.  Too bad directors like David Lean and Norman McLeod are no longer around to take full advantage of this wonderful tale!
B0026A5TBC|2.0|This album when it was first released was so raunchy and unapologetically sex-maniacical and obsessed that it was banned from release in a number of countries including Singapore.  It seemed every track was from a one-track mind with a foul-mouth that dared to put God and unbridled lust together in the same lyric whose shriveled up body seemed to be due to his squeezing out every last drop of his essence on anything that moved.  Thankfully this undoubted talent would later progress and show that he was capable of other thoughts that rise above the baser primitive instincts of man and would show more lofty concerns on future albums such as the brilliant album Sign 'O' the Times for example.<br /><br />This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version though is a disappointment as the SHM-CD treatment of using a allegedly better reflective plastic material does little to improve the sound quality over previous releases.  The mlps design too is a disappointment coming in thin, poor quality cardboard that is flimsily assembled looking like it will come apart easily once the glue gets old.  2 inner sleeves are provided corresponding to the original vinyl release which was a double lp although there is only one cd in this mlps package.  A 16-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese is also included.<br /><br />No noticeable improvement in sound quality and a mediocre mlps design and assembly makes this certainly not good value for money and hence not recommended.
0783229372|3.0|The best aspect of this film is the cinematography--the viewer truly gets the feeling that he or she is cruising across the Atlantic on the Hindenburg.  That is no small feat, and this film pulls it off brilliantly.  Unfortunately, the storyline does not live up to the special effects.  George C. Scott competently portrays a German Luftwaffe intelligence officer assigned to prevent sabotage to the Hindenburg, as it makes a cruise between Nazi Germany (1937) and New Jersey.  In actuality no one has ever proven the cause of the famous explosion that destroyed the Hindenburg, but this film's story involves sabotage.  Other than Scott, the characters never really come alive, and the storyline plods along to its pre-ordained conclusion.  This is a watchable film, but probably not one that many viewers will watch more than once.  RJB.
B00001PE4D|2.0|If you're familiar, even in passing, with Christopher's Hampton's stage play Les Liaisons Dangereuses (based on the 18th century novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos) or its subsequent (and very popular) film incarnation, Dangerous Liaisons starring the insanely brilliant Glenn Close as the black hearted Marquise de Merteuil and, in my opinion, the miscast John Malkovich as the lascivious and callous bon-vivant, Vicomte de Valmont than you can easily forego seeing this rather inept and not surprisingly insipid modernization and blithely go about your business.  Something has definitely been lost in translation and it extends far beyond period costumes and Bach's keyboard concertos.  Though a teenager's ability to descend the depths of cruelty is well known and documented, rarely is it of the sophisticated and viciously calculated variety, such as is the case here.  Furthermore, we're not dealing with pawns that live within the sheltered environs and cloistered walls of 18th century France, but rather modern adolescents living rather privileged existences in one of the world's most modern and sophisticated cities, New York.  They're hardly as gullible as pious 15 year old girls reared in convents.  Pulling the wool over their collective eyes is going to take considerable effort not to mention near Machiavellian craftiness.  In this retelling, both the plot and characters reek of artifice and you don't know whether to laugh or take the film seriously.  It has nothing to do with the performances but rather with everything leading up to them, primarily a script that aches to be modern, yet is often times burdened with some stilted and archaic dialogue as if it's trying to hearken back to and somehow channel its original source.  I mean, how many 16 year olds nowadays do you know of that write actual letters?  I don't mean emails or text messages, I mean physical letters?  In short, the film, more often than not, suffers from an identity crisis.  The actors were more thandecent and they did their best considering the material they were given and the soundtrack isn't at all bad, either.  In closing, the movie is hardly dreadful and it can be rather entertaining but, again, if you're familiar with the 1988 Stephen Frears' film or to a lesser extent Milos Forman's Valmont of a few years later, you'll find yourself squinting through Cruel Intentions, vainly and understandably searching for remnants of either film and their respective characters and will be left feeling somewhat frustrated by the exercise.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|I don't like jam bands, hippies or electronic music necessarily, so I never thought I'd be a person buying, let alone writing a glowing review of, an Animal Collective album.  If I wouldn't have blindly heard \\"Summertime Clothes\\" on the radio, I'd probably still be stuck in some weird anti-hipster prejudice, but for goodness sakes that song is amazing.  It's the song of the summer, I'd say, if not the best song all year.  While I like \\"My Girls,\\" I'm not sure why it gets top-billiing on this album.  \\"Lion in a Coma\\" is another standout for me, and you can probably tell from those song choices that I'm more into the danceable tracks.  You wouldn't be able to tell, however, that I dance uncontrollably to the only jaw harp riff that you can get your groove back to.  The slower tracks, although not as catchy for me, peice the album together well and reward multiple listens.  There is a difference between an album being overrated and a groundbreaking album being hailed as such, and I think the haters may realize this ten years down the line.

0385341008|5.0|I completed this book almost doing a Marathon, but regretting its being such a page turner, because I truly did savor every word, all these wonderful characters, the story itself, and the amazement of reading something \\"novel\\" in letters, just letters. I can totally recommend this lovely book and have, to all my friends. In addition there is a beautiful short piece about creativity, all art, at the end of this book, written by the \\"chief\\" author, and it's so lovely I leave it to the reader to find this nugget, which I will use in my upcoming class, called Into The Heart of Art.<br /><br />I see many people have written about this book. It's not any more a piece of fluff than a dandelion puff, which, when it is closely examined lends such beauty of symmetry, form, and more.<br /><br />And the history is so interesting, so poignant, and well researched. I say Bravo to the two women authors.<br /><br />I hope this review makes YOU want to read this book. Oh, and a caveat, I think it's mostly a book that will appeal to women but I could be wrong.

B001KL3GY0|5.0|That's right, I'll go against the grain of naysayers and say that, at the end of the year, this will still sound amazing and get booty upon booty shaking.  When it first came out, I was hesitant to buy.  I loved the first album and thought the second was nothing special, but wanted to give them another try.  It worked.  For about two weeks straight, I listened to nothing but this album.  It woke me up in the morning and comforted me when I was drunk and wanted to pretend that I wasn't turning into a raging alcoholic (it was a bit of a rough spell.)  It's not radically different from any of their older stuff, that's true, but the synths make it different enough that it's not another \\"You Could Have...' which I thought was largely a rehash of the brilliant first.  I just killed the two dominating points of view with one sentence.  Anyway, the difference I see is that this is dance-rock with a British touch while the debut was Brit-pop with a dance-rock touch.  I've got to admit that after the first two weeks went by, and I moved onto other things, that I thought it may be a passing fancy--that the hooks would annoy rather than continually fascinate.  I recently listened to it again--sober, even--and realized that it was much more than that.  I haven't liked an album this much since \\"Return to Cookie Mountain.\\"  I can be hammered, pop either in, and be transferred to a different sonic world.  \\"Twilight Omens\\" and \\"Bite Hard\\" are both still hilarious to me.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I only started watching \\"Dexter\\" because it was shown on regular television during the summer when the writer's strike was on. I got hooked and have been a big fan ever since. I got seasons one & two right after I saw the \\"cleaned-up\\" version of season one and then sat down and watched both dvd sets one after another. I swear I wouldn't do that with this 3rd season set... hah! It was impossible! This season lives up to the prior two. It puts one on the edge of their seat from the first second and you are there till the very end. Now, darn it!, I'm going to have to wait and wait till season four, which hasn't even been shown on Show Time yet!!, comes out. Yikes! Get this set and be prepared to be spellbound by Dexter Morgan once again. It's another great season and you will not be let down.

However, a few Uglies rebel against this thinking, wanting to keep their own appearance.<br /><br />This book is not just a story, but a commentary on society today. It actually has valid arguments for both sides. The author did a decent job of hiding most of his preaching within the storyline.<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled with one portion of Tally's journey to become a rebel. There were some inconsistencies in her learning curve.<br /><br />I felt like the ending was a bit rushed. .<br /><br />I found the description of the society to be rather simplistic, even for a YA book. It didn't really explain how the society maintained itself within the structure of age groups.<br /><br />Character Development: 4 Stars<br /><br />Tally's character was very well done. She was a deep thinker without appearing to be too wise beyond her years.<br /><br />David was not done nearly as well. There was no real explanation as to why he trusted Tally so much practically on sight, when almost everyone else was suspicious. Considering that he should have been one of the more interesting characters, he was very shallow.<br /><br />Writing Style: 4 Stars<br /><br />The first sentence was written to attract thirteen year olds. After that, the writing does get somewhat more mature. It never quite reaches adult level, but I do think it would take a middle teen to catch all of the nuances and references.<br /><br />The constant usage of childish names, littlies and grippy shoes, did get rather annoying after awhile. I think a teenager might even question the `baby' terms for everything.<br /><br />Editing/Formatting: 5 Stars<br /><br />I got this book from the publisher's site for free. That version had some very bad formatting. So, I downloaded the sample from Amazon; the sample looks fine and had no discernible problems.<br /><br />Rating: PG for mild violence and mature situations
B002BFBAWO|1.0|Beside the fact that I was terribly bored with the story, it was unbelievably inaccurate.  The clothing, the hair, the fact that none of these 18 year olds had trouble getting booze or getting into clubs - it made me wonder if any of the filmmakers were alive in 1987.  I remember a lot more hairspray and hot rollers, and fake IDs.    The only character that's sympathetic is the Russian lit major, and his one good chance at a conflict fizzles like a dud firecracker.  The rest of the characters are boring and one dimensional.  The so-called love story is clearly going to be a failure, regardless of how it turns out.      Don't bother with this one.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|The Twenties Girl story shows how elderly family members (especially in nursing homes) often tend to be overlooked or forgotten by younger generations. This book is a good reminder to cherish and appreciate those individuals for the fascinating lives they have led before it's too late.    The story was original and very unlike anything I'd ever read before. If you had told me beforehand it was a \\"ghost story\\" I probably wouldn't have picked it up.  After seeing all the 5 star reviews on Amazon, however, I decided to give it a try as I have enjoyed Sophie Kinsella books in the past. The beginning of the story was a little crazy and chaotic and I wasn't sure I was going to like where the book was going, but once I got a few chapters into it I could hardly put it down. It was something a little different than the norm and definitely an entertaining read!
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Let me begin by saying yes, you can listen to your vinyl as you're recording it, or at least I had absolutely no trouble at all doing it.  Also, it doesn't disrupt any of the other sounds on my computer--I can record a vinyl, listen to it, and have other sounds from my computer simultaneously.  Secondly, the USB cable did not work for my computer (it apparently didn't like my 64-bit operating system... immediately after installing the audio codecs, all of my programs crashed), so I've only used the line-in connection.  Due to that, I've used the free software Audacity to record all of my vinyls (perhaps the bundled software works through the line-in... can't say I've tried or felt the need to).  Fortunately, Audacity has a number of pages online dedicated to recording vinyl with their software, so it's very easy to use.  Now that I've got that out of the way, the player itself works great.  I've only had it a week, but I've already recorded around 20 albums to my computer with only one minor problem (one side of one album tends to skip a lot, but considering it's only happened to that particular album, I won't attribute that to the player).  The sound quality is great, though since I don't have the CDs, I have nothing to compare the sound quality to.  I've noticed that my recordings are noticeably quieter than other songs on my computer, but I think this is due to me not knowing the appropriate volume for the line-in audio (a setting on the computer, not the record player itself).  While Audacity does have the capability to amplify the audio, I'm hesitant to over-amplify it just to make the volume on par with other files on my computer.  Having said all of that, there are a couple of things that annoy me about this turntable.  First, the RCA cable is attached the unit and is only 2 feet long, meaning that you'll probably need to buy some sort of extension cable to attach it to your computer.  Secondly, it would be nice if there was an on/off switch on the player.  Whenever I'm done using it, I have to climb under my desk to turn it off.  While these are both relatively annoying, neither warrants a drop to 4 stars.  All in all, I'm very satisfied.
0740748475|5.0|Ever since I discovered \\"Calvin & Hobbes\\", I couldn't resist to their charm. This was one of the best gifts American cartoonists have given to the world. Most incredible was the wonderful adaptation to Mexican Spanish done by Editorial Patria back in the 90's. I don't either know or understand why this title hasn't been reprinted. Probably copyright issues. I bet that if any publishing company took the chance and reprinted all the volumes, many of us faithful followers would run and get our copy. This might be a little suprising to you, and yet, I still remember that every person to whom I showed my collection did enjoy and love everything about Calvin, Hobbes, Mom, Dad, Susie,the babysitter (we know her as Rosalinda), the bully from school (in Mexico he was named Mauri), the teacher and the principal... I mean they're unforgettable characters living lovely adventures. Their insights about the adult world and how it doesn't make much sense most of times to a six-year-old and how he relates to his very best friend and confident... Please, please, I'm begging you for a version in Mexican Spanish of \\"Calvin & Hobbes\\".

0743270754|5.0|Team of Rivals is a masterpiece of historical writing. This is a book of significant detail and length, but one I found quite readable. Some (especially my friends with fast-fact internet leanings) might object to all of those details the author provides us concerning the day-to-day descriptions of people, events, times, and relationships, but I found it very effective. While reading this I felt more connected to the mid-19th century than when reading any other book concerning events of the same period. I had a good feel of what it was really like back then--it was palpable to me. Certainly the Civil War was a ghastly thing, but I actually felt some of the fear and uncertainty of those times through the author's painstakingly crafted relation of not just the events, but truly of the times.  Add to that the technique this work uses to explore the genius of Lincoln and this book is even more remarkable to me. We learn about many of the things we already know about Lincoln, but this time through angles provided by examining his rivals for the presidency who he amazingly chooses to be in his cabinet and then the rivalries that followed. Through this we get more of a 360 view of Lincoln, which I did not expect when I started reading the first chapter. And this view is from is from sharply separate angles created taken from Lincoln's relations with other great or pivotal politicians of diverse natures during those trying and fearful days. I found this to be a simply marvelous technique, one that I don't specifically recall from other historical texts concerning 19th century America. This is absolutely a must-read for anyone seriously interested in Lincoln--and perhaps anyone aspiring to run for President of the United States. I'm not surprised that President Obama has thought so highly of this work--to the point that it might prove to be prescient.

B001FB4VZS|1.0|I am hearing impaired and I contacted Warner Brothers to find out if Season 8 box set had English subtitles.  They replied: no English subtitles on the Season 8 box set released in the United States.  They did this once before on another season.  They made the general public angry as subtitles for other languages were included on the DVDs released in the United States. Americans had to go to another region (country) to get/buy a version with English subtitles.    Warner Brothers, one of the most prestigious movie studios in the world,  should be ashamed to release a DVD and/or a DVD Box set in the United States that deliberately excludes a segment of the American viewing public; i.e. the hearing impaired.. I also know there are people who watch DVDs with the subtitles on in order to fully enjoy and understand the dialogue even though they are not hearing impaired.      I wish that that all viewers of Warner Brother products would convey the public's displeasure to Warner Brother's upper management.  Shame.  Shame.    Rick Ovington
B0017U7PT6|2.0|This movie is easy to look at, gives you something to do while you think about something else and best of all it's disposable.  Sure, you can invest your precious time in paying attention to it, but does doing so really get you anywhere and do you come out of it a better person?  Probably not.  Rent this, but before you return it scratch it up really badly.  You have now just paid it forward: The next renter, unable to watch it, will be saved 2 hours of time he probably should be spending mailing out child support checks anyway.  Job well done.  Pat yourself on the back.    But seriously, don't pay for this movie.
0066620996|2.0|I read chapter one and the whole time I was thinking, 'You're defining a \\"great\\" company based on the company's stock performance.'<br /><br />That is such 1980's benchmarking! I think the author chose the lazy way out by using the easiest way to evaluate companies using the criteria that is readily available to anyone--the NYSE & NASDQ data.<br /><br />How about examining the unobvious? Evaluating criteria such as an organization's environmental footprint, human rights, integrity and honesty of the organization, the capicity to maintain enduring relationships, concern for the safety and well being of employees, customers and citizens, and conformity to social norms and lawful behavior, just to name a few.<br /><br />Today, if you take a look at some of compaines that Jim Collins puts on a pedestal:<br /><br />Fannie Mae:<br /><br />Just look what NYTimes columnist Steve A.

But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980's.\\"<br /><br />Wow! How did author Jim Collins and his thousands of researches miss that?!? They did do a LexusNexus search, didn't they??? That article would surely have popped up. At the very least, it should have signified to Collins Inc. that Fannie Mae was a company that was willing to risk its long term health for short term gains--not an indicator of a \\"Great\\" company in my book--but then, it's not my book.<br /><br />Bank of America, the business the author contrasted Fannie Mae with, ended up with much better consequences.<br /><br />Other \\"Great\\" companies...<br /><br />Circuit City--Bankrupt<br /><br />Phillip Morris--Makes products that kill people.<br /><br />To me, the book is solely focused on monetary performance and sadly ignores so many other important ways that companies can truely be GREAT.<br /><br />The book is not all bad, because it does offer some markers of what seem to make excellent companies, but...<br /><br />C'mon Collins!

0316066524|4.0|Dave Eggers wrote his [[ASIN:0375725784 A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius]], which I read rather quickly several years ago.  A staggering work of a real genius, namely the late David Foster Wallace, takes a little longer to read, about four weeks in my case to finish \\"Infinite Jest.\\"  This is not a book for everyone.  It starts at the end and ends in the middle.  Three substantial story lines (about a junior tennis academy, a nearby drug-and-alcohol halfway house, and a wheelchair-bound Quebec-based terrorist organization dedicated to breaking apart the newly formed Organization of North American Nations (O.N.A.N), thus liberating their homeland) touch at the edges, but never dovetail into the definitive, explanatory ending that you first hope for (but give up on when you realize there's not enough room for it.)<br /><br />There is room, however, for more than 150 pages of detailed footnotes in six-point type in an end-section.  Some are technical explanations (particularly from the narcotics culture) that you can skip; other, longer entries are integral to the plot.  Did I mention the title?  Within the book, \\"Infinite Jest\\" is the title of an avant-garde film that is so entertaining that those watching it lose interest in all other aspects of their lives, including eating.  They just watch the film in an infinite loop until they die or emergency personnel respond, whichever comes first.<br /><br />If all this sounds like a mess, well it is, in a way.  It also exemplifies the postmodern school of novels.  Dom DeLillo's [[ASIN:1416548645 Underworld (Scribner Classics)]] comes to mind - books of sweeping scope and minute detail that defy all the expectations of traditional novels.  What do you get in the bargain?  Some of the most brilliant writing I've ever read, particularly regarding the world of addiction - addiction being probably the major theme of the book - and twelve step processes.  The most sympathetic character is halfway house night manager Don Gately, a narcotics addict who Keeps Coming Back.  During his research for the book, both AA and NA groups gave Wallace broad access to their meetings.  His descriptions of the process first seem off-the-wall, but you also sense that they're not very far off, if at all.<br /><br />Wallace's political satire is also sensational.  I'll not soon forget President Frank Gentile, the clean-freak lounge singer cum President who orchestrates the merger of the U.S, Canada and Mexico into O.N.A.N. in order to clean up what's become a very messy country.<br /><br />As a burned-out former junior tennis player, Wallace can and does describe that scene in minute detail.  The Enfield Tennis Academy (E.T.A.) is more than a little nutty, being that avant-garde filmmaker James Incandenza (known to his family as \\"Himself\\") founded it (a listing of Incandenza's films in the footnotes was a highlight for me).  Himself's son Hal, an Oxford English Dictionary-memorizing genius modeled after both Wallace and Hamlet, is our guide through that world.  His brothers Orin (a tennis player turned NFL punter, the conversion to which is another of the book's most memorable scenes) and Mario (product of a birth defect and extremely difficult delivery who seems to be modeled after R2D2 of Star Wars) also play co-starring roles.<br /><br />For the most part, the tennis content wasn't as fascinating as the addict content.  The espionage content was somewhat confusing, given that Wallace writes much of the dialogue in English based on Quebecois-French syntax.  The addict content also can be confusing as Wallace writes from the perspective of characters with seriously Substance-altered minds.<br /><br />I think I mentioned that \\"Infinite Jest\\" isn't for everyone.  But if you're up to a challenge (\\"Underworld\\", [[ASIN:0965045641 Middlesex]] by Jeffrey Eugenides or [[ASIN:0312421273 The Corrections: A Novel]] by Jonathan Franzen might be good lead-ins), and yearn for some scorch-your-eyeballs writing, by all means give it a try.  Four brilliant stars.stars.

I would list all the great tracks here, but it's easier to list the not great ones in this 28-track blistering CLASSIC.    \\"Dani California\\" sucks, \\"Snow\\" is ultra-repetitive, \\"Animal Bar\\" is slow and lame. \\"Tell me Baby\\" is just ok, funky yes, but plug-and-chug repetitive. But really, that's about it, and you have to expect a couple of less-than-stellar tracks following an album as awful as \\"By the Way.\\"  The other 24 tracks pretty much rock, and some of them are among the Chili Peppers' greatest.  As far as this RHCP fan is concerned this is a RHCP CLASSIC.  It's definelty up there with \\"Freaky Styley,\\" \\"Mother's Milk,\\" \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic,\\" and my personal fav \\"Californication.\\"  In fact, after \\"By the Way\\" was not the successor to \\"Californication\\" I'd hoped it would be, \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" is.  If you're an RHCP fan who just can't let go of \\"they haven't done anything as-good-as BSSM since 1991\\" my response would be that the Chili Peppers have grown up, and you should too.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love this show. Fullstop. Without reservation. I have read all the Sookie Stackhouse books and enjoyed them greatly. Alan Ball's interpretation doesn't disappoint at all. Far from it. He's provided another way to really enjoy a rollicking and very adult story. The show diverges from the books in some ways yet remains true in theme and flavour. I like all the changes (from Harris' books) that Ball has written into the two series. They add texture and flavour in spades. This HBO series is fresh, brave, sexy, outrageous and sheer fun. Unique in concept. I rank it alongside Dexter, Weeds, the Sopranos.    Those who like their vampire stories mild and bloodless may not enjoy this. This is not Twilight, nor the easily digested Buffy or Angel. True Blood is a raunchy and novel tale beautifully acted by the cast members main and minor. Those who cast the characters deserve immense kudos. I couldn't fault their choices.      The episode intro is brilliant and never gets boring - both the music and the pastiche of well-chosen imagery. Just as good as the Sopranos intro and that is a show-stopper.     I've bought the series and will buy the second. And the third which I hear HBO will be delivering to us next year.     Thank you, Alan Ball and HBO!
B000W4KT6E|5.0|Hairspray / B000W4KT6E<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to think going into 'Hairspray' - all I knew was that it had been hugely critically acclaimed back when it first came out, but that doesn't always mean a movie will be any good. Let me just say, though, that in this case all those fawning critics were absolutely correct.<br /><br />Where do you start when recommending 'Hairspray'? The singing, to start with, is absolutely divine, and the lyrics of the songs are so fun and wild it's impossible not to laugh. The acting, too, is wonderful - Pffeifer is delightful in her role as the petty, aging prom queen; Latifa is spectacular, as always; Walken plays the same persona that he always plays so well; and while I was initially put off by Travolta's performance, he finally won me over and I had to admit that at the end of the movie, his character is probably one of my favorites - it's one thing to portray a character who is coming into her own as a young woman, but it's another thing entirely to pull off a character who is trying to recapture the spirit and joi de vivre of youth, and he does it well.<br /><br />I was surprised to see that so much of the plot of 'Hairspray' revolved not around accepting a young woman despite her heavy size (what I had assumed the movie would be about) and instead focusing on race relations and acceptance in society in general. Indeed, at the end of the movie, we have two of the most-rare-couples-in-movies: an interracial couple (where the girl is taller than the boy, no less!) and a heavy-girl/heartthrob-boy couple. This universal message prevents the movie from being just another teen movie about loving yourself and not listening to society's demands for perfection, and instead turns it into something timeless and classic. Even better, I was pleased to see that the main character never really judges her body image negatively - she is what she is, and it doesn't really bother her. That's incredibly unusual for a movie - the usual subtext underneath all the 'acceptance' platitudes is that, ideally, you would work to get that perfect body anyway, and just 'accept' yourself in the meantime. Tracy, however, doesn't 'accept' her flaws - she actively loves herself and acknowledges that she is lovely and talented.<br /><br />Although I'm sure that the musical from which this movie was adapted was probably even better (live performances very often are), I definitely recommend 'Hairspary' as one of the best movies I've seen. I went into it dreading a sludgy \\"love yourself\\" teen movie and instead found a movie that was incredibly funny, edgy, and unforgettable.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollh all the 'acceptance' platitudes is that, ideally, you would work to get that perfect body anyway, and just 'accept' yourself in the meantime.

0312370849|3.0|I was expecting something more compelling, having read some of the reviews.  While the alternating stories between Sarah and Julia was an intersting narrative device and was done in a way that helped move the story forward, I did not find the story especially haunting or her writng all that insightful.  No new questions were raised and the moral questions that have remained from that time period were not given any different nuance.  The ending, though contrived, was very, very predictable.  I also felt as though the author ripped off several plot elements from well known chic books/flicks, particularly Le Divorce and In Her Shoes.  I do give the book props for providing some of the historical background of the French collaboration with the Nazis to kill Jews. It should not be overlooked that the author is French, and her bravery in tackling this topic should be commended.  I hope this book signals a trend in more openness and honesty from the French regarding this dark chapter of their history.  Every country has experienced things people would rather forget, but what happened in July, 1942 should not be so easily swept under the rug.
0307278255|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri published her first book of short stories, \\"Interpreters for Maladies\\", and won the Pulitzer Prize in 2000. A couple of years ago, I had to read her first book for a book club and found it to be a very interesting snapshot of the lives of first and second generation family members from India. Now, this second book, \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\", struck me to be even better than before. I hate to criticize Lahiri but her first book was too preachy. All of the stories wrapped up too cleanly and seems to be more like Aesop fables. I guess maybe that was the whole theme of her collection of short stories but I found it a bit forced and not natural. That's just my perception even though I enjoyed the stories and discussing them with friends at the book club. This new collection of short stories and more like novellas with no rhyme or reason for teaching us things. No superstitions and all this other stuff that plagues the old vs. new generation of families from India. I know that literature critics thrive on illusions/symbolism, etc. but to me it doesn't have to be that obvious to us. Although it does make for good discussion points in book clubs...<br /><br />I will describe the first story of the same name to avoid writing a lengthy review of this book. The first story entitled \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" is vivid in detail about Ruma and her father who stayed with her for a short visit to take care of her son, Akash. No earth-moving drama in this short story but still alot of unspoken truths and realizations are made by both characters. Lahiri even makes the smallest details of uttermost importance and it resonates strongly with the reader. I still remember the line about the grandfather who is reading Dr. Seuss' \\"Green Eggs and Ham\\" to his grandson for the first time with a slight unfamiliarity in his voice. It reminded me of my parents reading \\"Ramona Quimby Age 8\\" to me when they would prefer to read to me the familiar \\"The Monkey King\\" stories. I think alot of first and second generation folks can totally relate to Lahiri because all the emotions of being up-rooted and in a new place are things we all experience. There is commonality in her experience and myself as an ABC (American Born Chinese). It's amazing how she tells the story as if it was her own story since these characters are some much alive off the pages of the book. I can't wait to finish the rest of this book of short stories.ond generation folks can totally relate to Lahiri because all the emotions of being up-rooted and in a new place are things we all experience.

B001DJ7PR8|3.0|This movie was like meeting a beautiful man who you think might like you but doesn't speak or understand any english. The scenery of Spain is so beautiful so perfect. It made me  sadder I didn't get to Spain this summer. Maybe next year.   Patricia Clarkson ,Scarlett Johannson,Javier Bardem and Chris Messina are beautiful and great actors, Most of the characters are unbelievably drawn.( Like Johannsen's character is ok with her lover having his ex- wife living in the house they share. Said character completely fine when Ex wife comes on to her and has sex with her and her boyfriend together. Come on ,now. I am no prude ,but I would be running for the door. Maybe its just that woody allen's view of the world is differant than mine.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|This album is simply terrific.  I put my headphones on to listen to this album, and was I hooked after 10 seconds.  There are very, very few albums that can capture me from first to the last track.  This album did it--consistent and musically delightful in every sense--I knew that I would have a hard time listening to anything else for several weeks.  The lyrics were well crafted, engaging, and thoughtful.  Most importantly, the lyrics don't encumber the wonderful composition of the music.  Nate, the lead singer, stamps the music with his unmistakeably catchy voice.  The talent and raw emotion that he displays is undeniable.  He sings about the painful experiences that are familiar to us all, but deals with it triumphantly.  The music picks you up with each note. The lyrics leave leave him vulnerable, yet the music unrelentingly tries, and ultimately succeeds in lifting him [and you, the listener] up.    The most beautiful thing that an artist can do is play from the heart.  This album is nothing but heart, be it broken or mended, and it gives it a ride through a beautiful emotional journey on a palanquin hoisted by oompa loompas.  Is it possible to stay sad while crying in a bounce castle [made out of cotton candy] that's full of lollipops and puppies?  I didn't think so.  Because that's exactly what this album is. This album is a sanity check.  This album is  fun.

B0021L8US0|5.0|District 9 is something that perhaps no one saw coming, and ends up being the absolute best movie of the summer hands down.  Produced by Peter Jackson and helmed by Neill Blomkamp (the director Jackson hand picked for the shelved Halo movie), District 9 depicts an alien race that came to Earth on an emergency basis a couple decades before hand, and have since become refugees in a violent slum in Johannesburg.  Bureaucrat Wikus (Sharlto Copley) is charged with serving eviction notices to the alien \\"prawns\\", and through a mishap, ends up undergoing a horrifying transformation that makes him a wanted man by everyone.  As he and a prawn dubbed Christopher Johnson become unlikely allies, things begin to really kick into high gear.  Beginning as part mockumentary and part satire on apartheid, District 9 takes its time to become a bloody full-blown action/sci-fi opus that stays with you long after the credits are done rolling.  What also helps make District 9 so good is that you truly never know what is going to happen next.  The sheer unpredictability of the film helps make it so magnetic, and newcomer Copley manages to be hateable, likable, and sympathetic all at the same time as his character continues to develop and change (literally) as the film goes on.  All in all, District 9 is an incredible science fiction film that features equal parts action and heart, and in a bloated summer full of empty blockbusters like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, G.I. Joe, and the like; it is indeed refreshing to see something like this on the big screen.  Do yourself a favor, don't miss out on District 9.

B001GCUO16|5.0|I haven't seen the film yet, but everyone that I have talked to and has seen it said that is was AWSOME !!!  I did get to play the PS3 game and it was kewl and I am planning on buying the dvd and blue ray (1 of each for my collection), and plan on watching it.  I can't wait to se it.Hugh Jackman as Wolverine can do no wrong in my eyes !!  I have read some of the reviews on here and noticed there are alot of well wishers. Meaning that they wanted to see this film like the comics have told the story, but come on folks if you really thought that was going to happen then you didn't watch any of the DC based films did ya?!!!  here's the way I see it,..at least you get to see your favorite character come to life.You finally got to see your hero kick some butt.  Comics are fantasy, not real life,..the Incrediable Hulk went through alot in the 70s and then look what they did to his latest films,...take it with a grain of salt all.I am antsy about the Captin America film being made (someday), I guess all we ALL can do is HOPE that someone will take this movie and keep it as close to the character and the history of the character as close as possible.But then again folks we're talking about HollyWeird, nothing is ever close with them people, even their real lives.  So until then ,..You can make mine MARVEL bub !!!  Wolvie
B00003CXB4|5.0|I bought this movie 5 years ago from Blockbuster. I saw The Lion King at school and this movie has everything. Emotion, comedy, horror, etc. The characters were great. My favorite is Timon. You may hear people say this movie is for little kids, (NOT TRUE). This is a movie for everyone. It's nice if you have a family with kids or even teens to sit down and pop this movie in. This movie is a little graphic in the scene were Mufasa gets killed. But shortly after Timon and Pumba will rebound the happy nature of the movie. I highly recommend this movie when is comes out of the Vault.
0061767581|3.0|I have only read the first half of this book and so far it is honestly just OK. The target audience is teens, however the people who have watched The Hills & Laguna Beach and are fans of Lauren Conrad are older. We grew up with her. This book is about two girls that move to LA for college. Think 18 years old, first time away from home and bars, wait what? Yeah, they walk into bars, no sweat. Hmm. Why is this in the teen section? There are sexual adventures, sleeping around with multiple guys. Okay but lets reconfigure...great book but for who? The college scene and TV show are fine for younger girls but for the more mature who grew up with her may find this book a little silly. But I suppose thats the fun and excitement of this book. Not getting carded when you are 18 years old walking into a trendy bar like Le Deux in LA. Sorry thats just not going to happen but maybe that's the Fiction part of this book. ;) and the part of this book aimed for young girls who wish to dream...I am not saying this isn't a good book but the target audience is confused...it sways back and forth trying to please a variety of audiences which just isn't happening.

B000PMGS8G|5.0|This is obviously the greatest movie ever made. It cannot be argued otherwise with any shred of credibility. I believe it won about 57 academy awards. Most intellectuals would agree that it should be required viewing for all citizens of the entire planet earth. (At least annually.) In a rigorous and scientifically controlled experiment Flash Gordon was compared with the only other greatest movie of all time, \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\" and found to have 63% more hyper-Hawkman overacting than 20 Captain Kirks combined. Lasers, spaceships, a guitar driven soundtrack! A 10 STAR film. 4 thumbs UP! A Triumph of filmmaking!
068485743X|5.0|This book has saved my writing and I'm not even a professional writer! The advice given in this book is priceless, in turn making it an indispensable resource for anyone that writes regardless of what type of writing it is.<br /><br />The author starts by tackling the technicality of writing from presentation to the proper use of adjectives and adverbs to sound and comparison. He then delves into dialogue, continuing to give advice on its many formats. From that, he ends with tools to help the writer get the best out of narration, tone, focus and setting.<br /><br />He starts each section with 1) what needs to be done followed by 2) how to do it and ending with 3) practice exercises. This book is definitely one resource I'll be referring to for while to come.
1569242739|5.0|Let me start this off by stating that I am NOT Vegan.  However, I have a couple of friends who are.  Now, I am somewhat of a cookbook junkie, and I am definately known in my circle for my baking skills.  I purchased this book out of sheer curiosity at first.  When a friend and I tried a few recipes we were pleasantly surprised!  My Vegan friends loved our samples so much, that I made 200 Vegan cupcakes (all recipes from this yummy book) for their wedding.  I piped the icing and decorated them with sugar crystals and placed them on a huge cupcake tier so they could have a \\"wedding cake\\" for their special day.  So fun, and so delicious!
B001GKYBXA|5.0|This is a very different collection than what we are used to from Sir Paul.  As a die-hard Beatle fan, this collection is unusual to me.  The more I listen though, the more I like it.

B001FB55M6|4.0|This is another less than perfect comedy that is completely carried by the brilliance of Jim Carrey. If any other actor starred in this flick, it would have fizzled. This isn't Jim doing anything award-worthy (Truman Show, Man on the Moon) or in-depth and dramatic (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), but it's him being the Jim Carrey we fell in love with through The Mask and Liar, Liar. A good one to watch on a lazy night at home, for some great laughs. Zooey Deschanel is always great, and doesn't stop being adorable in this one. Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterson are quite funny as Jim's buddies who love the new man he's become, but I think the best supporting role in the film is Jim's boss at the bank, played by Rhys Darby, in his first acting role. Look out for this guy, he's hilarious. Check this out, it's definitely worth a rental, if not a purchase, used on Amazon. :-)
0312360266|5.0|I absolutely love that this series combines both being a vampyre with calling to the elements like a witch in the Craft.

Oh, and the setting of Oklahoma is awesome since I was born an Okie!

B002EWD08Q|2.0|After several listens, it's clear that Josh Homme had way too much influence on a really fine, gritty, creative (in a way that only the British can be) group of musicians who were making some of the best music out there.  Homme has made some great music himself, no doubt, but it's not Monkeys music and unfortunately, it seems that his influence absolutely killed their spirit.    I have nothing against members of a band growing and trying new avenues to express themselves, but this album is downright boring, something I never thought I'd say about the Arctic Monkeys.  Up until now, they had been anything but boring.      They took themselves way too seriously on this one...
B0009MW1UG|5.0|... I was looking for the \\"Summer song\\", but found \\"They Won't Go\\" instead.  Such a ... melancholy song ... It sounds sad and somber, but I actually was lifted out of my depressed mood after listening.  Another song like that (not featured on this project, on SITKOL a few years later) is \\"Joy Inside My Tears\\".  Stevie just has a way of doing that. He'll always be at the top of my list.<br /><br />TruSoulDJ
630521610X|5.0|Wes Craven, who has brought us great scares with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS, THE SERPENT & THE RAINBOW, THE HILLS HAVE EYES, RED EYE and THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. Wes tried to kill the slasher genre by making SCREAM. Which coincidently was going to be titled; SCARY MOVIE. This movie is packed with hysterical laughs and outraegous kills. The movie also included trivia such as Jason wasn't the killer in the FRIDAY THE 13TH franchise until the 2nd movie. Wes Craven hired an all star cast which includes Neve Campbell (PARTY OF FIVE), David Arquette (NEVER BEEN KISSED), Courtney Cox Arquette (FRIENDS), Matthew Lillard (WITHOUT A PADDLE), Jamie Kennedy (MALIBU'S MOST WANTED), Rose McGowan (CHARMED), Skeet Ulrich (LAST DANCE), Liev Schreiber (X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE) and Drew Barrymore (E.T.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|Blood spatter analyst by day, blood spatterer by night.  Dexter Morgan, (Michael C. Hall), serial killer extraordinaire, is back for a third season of Dexter.  And believe it or not, the series is still just as good without James Doakes, (Erik King).<br /><br />We start off season three with Dexter finally feeling comfortable in his own skin.  He's even able to enjoy having sex with his girlfriend, Rita, (Julie Benz), instead of just pretending to enjoy it for her sake.  But, of course, his world is turned upside down when at the very beginning of the season, Rita announces that she is pregnant.  Dexter isn't sure what to do.  How can he raise a child?  Especially when all he can envision is that child turning out to be another serial killer like him?<br /><br />Meanwhile, there's a new guy, Joey Quinn, (Desmond Harrington), at the office and Dexter's sister, Deb, (Jennifer Carpenter, Hall's now real-life wife), is being hounded by Yuki, (Liza Lapira), for information on him.  Maria, (Lauren Velez), promotes Angel, (David Zayas), which helps him to work more closely with Deb, trying to get her to fine-tune herself, to get a handle on how real police work is done, instead of letting her mouth get her into trouble, as usual.<br /><br />A highlight of the new season is that Dexter starts breaking his code when it comes to killing people, either by accident or because they threaten to harm his family.  Normally, he would only kill people who had killed previously killed others.  Not anymore.  He even gets caught by Miguel Prado, (Jimmy Smits), a powerful ADA who figures prominently in this season, and, indebted to Dexter for killing his brother's murderer, Prado befriends him.  Dexter can feel his guards coming down and worries about his newfound friendship.  While all of this is going on, Rita is trying to keep her family together, since when Astor, (Christina Robinson), and Cody, (Preston Bailey), find out that their mom is going to have another baby, Astor acts out, thinking her mom and Dexter should be married if they're going to welcome a baby.<br /><br />Deb's penchant for trash talk becomes more of a punchline in this season, since they use a lot of her long strings of lackluster verbiage as her reactions to certain situations, such as finding out that Dexter is to become a father.  She almost loses an informant with her brash attitude but once she starts to lighten up a bit, with Angel's help, she begins a closer relationship with him.<br /><br />The handling of this season's serial killer is also a bit different.  At the beginning, the department believes they have it all figured out, but as the evidence mounts against them, they realize that the person they had in mind all along, Miguel's brother, \\"Freebo\\",  was not the right person after all.  Of course, Dexter and Miguel are already aware of this, mainly because Dexter killed Freebo and Miguel caught him doing it, but when bodies start turning up with long slices of skin removed, they soon realize that they have another new serial killer on their hands.<br /><br />Will Dexter catch this season's killer before the police department does?  How will he rationalize killing people who never killed anyone?  Can he be a father?  Will he marry Rita?  So many questions but worth sticking around for the answers.  Dexter never disappoints and seems to only get better as the show goes on.ter should be married if they're going to welcome a baby.

0765360969|5.0|I'm always glad to find another fantasy novel/series with an interesting twist. Here, the obvious twists are the magic system -- which at first seems really strange but works very well, very consistently, and the mystery of its origins adds interest -- and the Dark Lord having won the battle for dominance. Then you notice the characters are well-written, complex and rarely one-dimensional: even minor characters have surprises in store, and most of them learn and grow believably. The best twists are spoilers, so I can't mention them, but suffice to say the last 1/4 of the book kept me up til 3 in the morning having to finish it.
B000YABIQ6|1.0|I can only guess at the reasons this dull show has gotten so much critical acclaim. My best guess is this: since most series feature everyone overacting to the nth degree and ham-handed cues telling us when to laugh or be emotionally effected, critics have begun to equate boring characters, long silences, and meandering conversations with \\"good acting\\" and \\"subtlety\\". There's a difference, people. Every episode is like a game of \\"guess what I'm thinking\\". Characters say and do seemingly random things, often wildly out of character--but we don't get to know why, we can only watch as the camera zooms in on them contorting their faces, not saying anything because \\"that's how it was back then\\". Yeah, yeah, whatever, the critics tell us that this is award-worthy work, but I'm not buying it. I'll stick to something that's actually interesting and compelling, thanks.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Viva la Vida should come with a warning label: \\"To fully enjoy/appreciate, listen at least ten times before making any judgments.\\" This is the advice I should have had a year ago when I got the CD, had one listen, and basically wrote it off as a poor follow-up to the two previous Coldplay albums.  I simply wasn't ready for it.    But what a difference a year makes.  I have finally awakened to the absolute brilliance of Viva la Vida.  And now, it is not only my favorite Coldplay work so far, but perhaps among my  favorite albums of all-time.  It is that brilliant. From the beautiful sublimity of \\"Death and all his Friends\\"--which is perhaps the best track on CD--to the power and mystery of \\"Cemeteries of London\\" and every other track in between.  One brilliant song after another.  I am humbled.  This is a monumental album from a monumental band.  Thank you, Coldplay.
B001G5IJVK|4.0|KISS has made an impact in music, no doubts on that. They are still around today and made some great music, the fact that they are still known today proves that. There have been many compilations out there and a box set already so what could another of these do that hasn't been done? Well, \\"Ikons\\" released in 2008, is a box set containing four discs representing each individual members of the band. There's been nothing like that before, usually you take all the hits and put them together to make a compilation, this time there is four discs and they represent each a member. It's noticeably different and in some ways much better, Paul, Gene, Ace and Peter are KISS but having a discs of material with some of each's music shows their distinct personalities and talent. The concept of Ikons is great and hasn't been done before but what about the music in there?<br /><br />The list is there and shows which song is where already so I won't do that. Gene's disc has the essentials \\"Deuce\\", \\"Calling Dr.Love\\" and \\"God Of Thunder\\" amongst others. \\"Radioactive\\" from his solo album was a predictable move, but it's a good song. Not much surprise with the song selection except for \\"Larger Than Life\\", also\\"Charisma\\" is odd but a good choice. Same thing with Paul, \\"Detroit Rock City\\", \\"Love Gun\\", \\"Strutter\\" and many others are no brainers. \\"Wouldn't You Like To Know Me\\" is a god choice from Paul's solo album. Ace and Peter's discs are more interesting because they aren't what you usually have on greatest hits and so this is something different. Of course there will be \\"Shock Me\\" and \\"Beth\\" but they have more songs from their solo albums. I found it great that included \\"Dark Light\\" from \\"The Elder\\" on Ace's disc as you don't see a lot of Elder stuff  near KISS compilations.<br /><br />Gene and Peter's discs have 1 song from their 1978 solo albums while Ace and Peter get 4 each. There's an easy explanation to this: Ace and Peter have written or been showcased in less songs than Paul and Gene have so it only seems normal that they would get more of their solo recordings on their discs. I find interesting that Ace and Peter each have a song from the \\"Psycho Circus\\" album (not that I personally care for Peter's track \\"I Finally Found My Way\\" but I thought \\"Into The Void\\" was one of the best things ace ever did).<br /><br />I think this set does a good job at showing how unique those people are while being in the same band. All in all these four individuals once were the collective force that is KISS and this set shows it. The songs chosen are both very representative and good. It's not something to get for a fan like me who has every album (including the solo ones) but if you don't own any KISS or you want to buy a compilation maybe this would be something to check out for, it's much more worth it. The thing is that it costs more than the average compilation so you have to shell out more cash which means you pretty much have to be a fan with nothing to buy this otherwise you may find it pricey. KISS themselves, as has been said in other reviews, did not endorse this release and they did not decide to do this but they thought the idea was pretty cool. Overall Ikons does a good homage to true ikons and is a good set.only seems normal that they would get more of their solo recordings on their discs.

B0029XZODY|4.0|The lovable serial killer is back for his third go-round in Dexter: The Third Season. After the rather shocking conclusion to season two, Dexter (Michael C. Hall) gets somewhat of a fresh start since the only people who knew about his dark secret are, shall we say, no longer with us. The season starts out with a bang -- Dexter kills someone accidentally without properly vetting him according to the code.<br /><br />This first victim is revealed to be the brother of Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), which turns the Miami police department into a circus as the prominent Prado family demands answers and retribution. Prado's involvement in the investigation leads to an unlikely friendship between him and Dexter, a friendship which bucks against all of Dexter's instincts and the lessons he learned from his father. As the season plays out, Dexter must decide whether he can successfully become a normal member of human society -- one with friends, meaningful relationships, even children -- or whether he should largely remain a recluse for fear of being found out for what he truly is.<br /><br />The success or failure of this season lies in whether or not the viewer likes the character of Miguel Prado. I honestly did not care for the entire arc involving him, so this season is the weakest of the three seasons that have aired, in my opinion. However, that's not to say that if you do not like Prado, then the season is not worth watching. There are many reasons that Dexter is one of the best shows on television, and one of those reasons is that even if there is a weak point in a season, there is plenty more intrigue to keep one's interest.<br /><br />As has been the case in the first two seasons, we learn a lot more about Dexter's deceased father, Harry (James Remar). Dexter starts to see that Harry might not have been the hero on a pedestal that Dexter has for so long believed him to be. Because of this, Dexter questions many of his father's teachings, seeking to adapt the \\"Code of Harry\\" more to his liking, especially in trying to make a friend in Miguel Prado. Even if one does not like Prado's character, watching the existential struggles that Dexter goes through in light of his relationship with Prado makes the season well worth watching.<br /><br />Further complicating things for the Dark Defender is his relationship with Rita (Julie Benz). Early on, Dexter finds out that he is going to be a father. This revelation really messes with Dexter's head as he wrestles with unending thoughts of how he would be as a father, how he could raise a child who never knew about the dark secret, and, worst of all, wondering if the child will turn out to be like him. This season boasts the greatest amount of character development, thus far, in Rita as she becomes a much stronger person and more mature as a character and a fixture in Dexter's life.<br /><br />The rest of the cast conducts business as usual, providing their own plot twists, such as Laguerta's (Lauren V&eacute;lez) previous relationship with the Prados, and comic relief. And then there's Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), Dexter's sister, whom the writers never really seem to know what to do with, other than involving her with guys she shouldn't be with.<br /><br />All things considered, this season of Dexter is definitely worth catching, though it's the weakest of the three existing seasons. Even so, Dexter is still more intelligent and refreshing than 99% of the drivel that ends up on television.<br /><br />Video/Audio<br />Like previous seasons, this Blu-ray set is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio in 1080p with bright and vibrant colors and an excellent picture quality. The audio, presented in 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, is also quite clear and sharp.<br /><br />Special Features<br />Also like previous Blu-ray versions of the Dexter series, this set is dreadfully devoid of special features.  In fact, no special features exist on the discs themselves (not even episode commentaries). The special features that the set boasts can only be accessed through BD-Live and include excerpts from the novel Dexter by Design, interviews with series stars Michael C.

B000SINT52|5.0|There was no hype in this documentary by Michael Moore.  It tells the whole truth and anyone who doesn't believe everything in this film is in denial.  I don't need to give a critique here, the movie says it all.  A MUST SEE !!!!
B001MEJY8W|4.0|Well, I wasn't sure what to expect from Martyrs, as the coverbox at the video store didn't say much except that two teenaged girls seek revenge on someone who abducted and tortured one of them as a child, and a reviewer who called it \\"one of the most ferocious horror movies ever made.\\"  So we had to check it out (over pizza and Little Kings).<br /><br />It was not what I was expecting . . . and I mean that in a good way.  The writing, acting, directing, and even the sets were top notch.  All of which were a surprise.<br /><br />********** SPOILER ALERT **************************<br /><br />The movie starts out with the one girl running away from the scene of her torture as a young child -- and there are flashbacks to that time throughout the film.  There is a brief interlude at the institution where she makes a lifelong friend.  Then, \\"15 YEARS LATER\\" she pulls a home invasion on some nice family's home and starts executing everyone with a sawn-off double-barrel.  But then spiders chew her brain and the invisible monster girl that only she can see starts chasing her.  So she telephones her bestest friend.  \\"Hey, like, can you come over?\\"  \\"Where you at?\\"  \\"I'm at the place.\\"  \\"Whatcho doing at the place?  You said you was only gonna LOOK at the place!\\"  \\"Gotta go, invisible monster girl is beating me again.\\" click.<br /><br />So her friend gets to the place, and apparently she's never seen someone blasted with two rounds of birdshot at pointblank range before and is somewhat upset about it.  \\"Hey, you think I'm crazy just like the doctors!\\"  \\"But lookit you, cuttin on yerself and tellin' me invisible monster girl dunnit.  Yeah, yer crazy alright.\\"  Then she goes and offs herself.  \\"Boo hoo, noooooooo.\\"  Then she takes a nap on the couch.<br /><br />Waking up, she discovers a hidden door, which leads to a very expensive metal hatch, which leads to an underground chamber that looks like it cost more than the 2 milliion dollar home atop it.  And then things get weird.  Google \\"Monarch Project\\" and \\"Satanic Panic\\" for an idea of the theme of Act 2.  Similar in concept, but different.  A wealthy elite who control the guvmint decide to turn young girls into portals to \\"The Other World\\" in hopes of getting a description of it.  Even though they've had no real success with their hypothesis they continue to pour millions of dollars into it -- sorta like SETI.  Then, after systematically torturing the remaining girl until she sees \\"something\\" they call a big meeting and the mean turban wearing lady has her whisper secrets to her for a while.  \\"Great description, let us summon the stockholders!\\"  And then the ending, which was confusing and nonsensical, but I suppose the writer can't go off revealing the \\"secret of secrets\\" to the unclean massess when he doesn't know it himself.  Realistically, it couldn't have ended any other way, but I'm still disappointed.<br /><br />Yeah, there is some brutal imagery, but it was integral to the plot and for the most part understated, unlike the \\"slasher porn\\" of garbage like Hostel and drivel like Saw (as well as their numerous imitators).  This was a well made and thoughtful production.  Watch it in the original French with English subtitles.  Just don't watch it with the kids and Grandma.<br /><br />4 STARS -- because of the disappointing ending and outlandish premise.  Great film otherwise.anic\\" for an idea of the theme of Act 2.

B000002OX5|5.0|This is probably my personal favorite Who record. There is quite an eclectic assortment of songs here, and it may strike most listeners as \\"unconventional\\". The hilarious faux-commercials are especially odd. Rael is the best song here, and it's interesting to hear echoes of Rael in the Sparks track from Tommy.     However, I recommend getting the deluxe edition of Sell Out for the bonus tracks and additional commercials rather than getting this version.    Ivan Rorick
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is one of the best things I have purchased from Amazon.  It is simply hilarious.  I have watched it so many times I know all the punch lines.  It is worth every penny!  I can't wait til season 2 comes out.  Must have!

B000WS4QJG|5.0|who could say anything negative about michael jackson's artwork, dance, music?  i can't.  the music carries you immediately back to a time, 25 years ago, when michael jackson's music was on top of the world and he carried you with him.  Who wasn't inspired to move, some us us pretended that we were dancing.  clearer, crisper than the vinyl i bought 25 years ago.  the 25th anniversary CD's were an excellent addition.  all of us love watching the dvd's of several of the top hits.  this was only $12!  it's fantastic and, for anybody who is a mj fan, it is well worthwhile adding this to your collection!  A+
B000002OX7|5.0|What more can be said about this universally lauded Who album? Although my personal favorite is Sell Out, Who's Next contains all the group's most famous classics (the kinds of songs one would be most likely to hear on an FM classic rock station... or  a commercial). Highly recommended.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|Great product! I purchased the whole set of Sponge Bob Ty beanies from Amazon separately. My toddler daughter loves sponge bob and gary especially. Great size! Perfect for carting around wherever you go.

0671449028|5.0|We are big fans of Sandra Boynton board books in my house. Each of my children (ages four and one) love them. This book is great. It has a simple rhyme and cute, whimsical pictures. Plus it's short and not wordy, which makes it the perfect bedtime book. Both of my kiddos enjoy this happy story about a bunch of animals on a boat getting ready for bed. The funny pictures and silly rhymes keeps there attention even on nights when they would rather still be playing than going to bed. I
B000002OX3|5.0|For those accustomed to the hard-rock guitar-smashing antics of the Who in the 1970s, the version of the band heard on this LP may be almost unrecognizable. It's unconventional but definitely worth a listen for that reason alone. It also includes \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\", which is both my personal favorite Who song and a kind of precursor to the \\"rock operas\\" for which they would later become famous. You should definitely seek out this extended edition, whcih features all sorts of great bonus tracks that were not present on the original vinyl LP.    Ivan Rorick
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's funny that someone posted earlier along the lines of some \\"collaborated effort to fan spam\\".  Well, no one shanghaied me.  I'm just here because like all these other people, by pure chance I saw this canceled show and was just blown away.  In general, I don't even watch TV because it sucks. And I never post things either.  I really think Sci-Fi (or Fox, whoever.. Sci-Fi seems a logical place for it) should do a simple poll.    1) Have you seen Firefly?  2) If yes, rate it 1 to 5 (1-ATROCIOUS, should have never been AIRED in the first place.....5-SPECIAL, should have never been CANCELED in the first place)    I'm thinking....  1) 90% What, you mean like a bug?     10% God don't talk about that, it just breaks my.. wait, are they bringing it back??  Did you hear something?  2) 90% 5     10% 4 or less    Anyway, this seems to be the general consensus, at least from what i've been reading.  The fact that it's one of only 2 CANCELED series ever to be made into a movie should tell you something.*    * I thought Serenity was decent as a movie, better for fans of course, but the series is where it's at.
0312370849|2.0|This book was very hard to get through because of the poor, choppy writing.  This was not as distracting for Sarah's story since it is supposed to be from a 10-year-old's perspective; however it just did not work for Julia's story.  I found myself wanting to skip her part altogether and only read the 1942 story-line.  This could have made for an amazing book; unfortunately, it just didn't deliver.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|If you are a Veronic Mars fan you must have this third season. I have eveyone watching and it's wonderful to play and review with friends. I can't hardly wait for the next season.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Cancelled my pre-order after seeing screenshots of how badly 'damaged' this release has been by over-zealous use of digital processing. The studios need to wake up. The battle scenes are INTENTIONALLY grainy, for goodness sake, so removing the grain just destroys the movie. Thanks, but no thanks.
0451169514|5.0|I'll tell you that one of the reasons I love Stephen King so much is because of his use of \\"Good vs. Evil\\". The Stand was a masterpiece for this and many of themes, but Good vs Evil also seems to be the theme that ties in so many other themes; most importantly \\"Love\\". What I found felt from reading this book was the entire spectrum of emotions and themes; evil, horror, fate, divinity, magic, friendship, good, love.... I won't bother reviewing what this book is about since you probably already know. But I want to urge you to read this not just because it is a horror novel with gore, evil, etc. I urge you to read this because I really believe that any person with a love of people and who values goodness, decency, friendship, the magic of childhood, the power of love, and spirituality would find this book very touching and emotional. Yes \\"touching\\". A horror novel being \\"touching\\". There is more than just horror, blood, and guts in Stephen King's writing. He has a wonderful understanding of people and I find his writing to be Humanistic rather than Horrific.   This is why I urge anyone with a love and apprecition for life to read this book. I would hope that that would mean everybody.
B001TH28EO|5.0|On the whole, I am delighted with this purchase.  I will leave reviewing the quality of the recordings (though I am pleased)  Instead, I will focus on packaging, since I am always curious about it and very few reviews deal with it.<br /><br />The box is the size of a jewel box cubed, so, quite small.  The discs are stacked vertically in the box and each disc is house in amedium thickness cardboard envelope with the disc number in the upper right so that they can be browsed through with ease.  The booklet lies on top of the discs under the flip top lid.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the set does not include the text of the lieder and vocal works.  I would have loved a CD ROM with those.  I do not speak German and frankly, with Schubert's lieder too, I find that knowing what the words mean greatly enhances my enjoyment.<br />There is a book by Sams, The Songs of Brahms, that has the texts, but it is an expensive book...<br /><br />All told, no regrets, especially at this bargain price, but having the texts would have made this an out of the park set...
B0009SS00A|2.0|This book was authored in the 90's. The technology depicted in the story is outdated today.  I knew that when I read it and was able to enjoy the book for the suspense and plot twists that Brown is particularly good at.
B000FZETKC|3.0|Good cast. Good story. A nice little teen movie from the past but it was a little better than just a teen movie. Had a big crush back then on Mary Stuart Masterson and her character here and in 'At Close Range' with Shawn Penn. Eric Stolz was great in his role and so was pretty much the rest of the cast. I was rooting the whole time for Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson to get together in the end.<br /><br />Good little movie from the past.
B000VS6QTK|2.0|Let's be honest, when you buy a video of a band performing live, you want to see the band - right? There is enough footage of the crowd to make an entire video. What footage of the band you do see is usually from very poor angles. the only way to see good angles is to go into the extras and view the cam of whatever band member you choose. Now you are stuck with watching only that band member. The song selection is great and the sound is pretty good. Whoever thought is was a good idea to film the bnd from behind and a 3/4 behind angle was really way off target. I have a problem with the quick cut editing as well. When you do see a brief clip of a band member, it is usually just that. I split second shot of that person and not always from a good angle at that. I was totally let down with this video and I am sorry I wasted my money. This is a strict \\"rent only.\\" There is no way I would watch this twice. They used 26 cameras to film this and you will see them often in the video. I am wondering where all the good footage went. A lot of the video is very grainy and quite a bit looks terrible due to the lighting onstage. IF you want to see the bands [...], watch this video. If you want to see a drummers bld head, watch this video. If you like sweeping camera shots of large crowds with the occasional crowd close-up, watch this video. If you want to see a good concert video, look elsewhere.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|I loved the movie, but I can't seem to give it more than 3 stars.  How can a French-themed movie, like Ratatouille, only offer it in the English language with NO option to watch it in French or Spanish.  I assumed that a DVD like Shreck (which comes with English, French and Spanish language options--STANDARD VERSION) would have paved the way.   Get this, you can even buy it in a Spanish version separately, but not in French.
B001P22HK8|5.0|This book had me hooked within the first couple of pages.    Can't wait for the sequel coming next year.    If you are a techie and are looking for a technically accurate techno thriller, pick this up!

1594488916|5.0|Talk about an unrepentant thief. John Gilkey was banned, watched and questioned but still would not stop his obsessive habit of... acquisitions.Totally untrustworthy, Gilkey wouldn't stop, even when warned by police. He simply saw himself above the law, accessing credit cards, and plotting how to grab more... and more.<br /><br />Allison Bartlett's work is terse writing, and a true detective work. Nice detailing makes it a can't-put-it-down read. Book thieves are a  hardy bunch; I've encountered them on a very personal level, so I had an immediate hate for Gilkey that only got me madder as I followed his guileless demeanor. You'll want to join in the pursuit of this weasel, and you'll be obsessed enough to keep reading. Bravo Bartlett! You totally grabbed this reader and didn't let go.
B002C39TU0|5.0|The sound quality and packaging of this very important album are superb! It doesn't get any better than this!
0307588335|5.0|This book is a fantastic read and I greatly enjoyed reading it. The book does a great job of capturing the problem with the personalities of the key power brokers that had a devastating impact on Lehman's ability to survive. Anyone who questioned Dick Fuld or his blessed lieutenants was shown the door. I also enjoyed the parts of the book devoted to the author's childhood because I think they give the reader (especially the \\"main street\\" reader) a meaningful context and background that people outside of Wall Street really cannot comprehend. The book gives great insight into the character of the firm and how Dick Fuld, Joe Gregory and a few other members of upper management led the firm to disaster. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about how we as a country got to the brink of the greatest economic disaster since the Great Depression or just interested in learning about the daily life of a Wall Street trader at a top firm.
B002C39TTG|3.0|As Churchbat already wrote in his review, this LP is sadly missing \\"This Charming Man.\\" The sound quality is superb, though, so I give it 3 stars.
B000VNMMR0|2.0|I am a huge fan of Die Hard. It set a standard for action flicks and has yet to be matched. Arguably Die Hard 2 was dopey as hell and was considered the weak link of the Die Hard series. I still like Die Hard 2 the same way that I like Lethal Weapon 3. Its the weak link of the series but still manages to be fun to watch. Die Hard With A Vengeance was a spectacular return to form. It had a unique and unlikely pairing that worked(Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis), one of the coolest villains in movie history(played by Jeremy Irons) and it worked as both action flick and a thriller. It might not get any respect from the MTV generation but those of us that respect an action flick with brains as well as a modicum of suspence love it. It was the best sequel in the Die Hard series and after watching this sludge that opinion still remains.     This movie was held together with a string of cliches and a prayer. For the record I wanted to like this movie. I was ecstatic when I heard the was going to be another Die Hard movie. Sadly this movie was too stupid for its own good. I could forgive this if the movie was entertaining but it was only entertaining for the first 30 minutes. Then the story gets dumber as it goes along and it becomes annoying to watch.    John McClane(Bruce Willis) is sent to pick up some hacker named Matt Farrell(Justin Long) and he ends up in ordeal regarding a cyberspace takeover with a antagonist called Thomas Gabriel(Timothy Olyphant). That is the gist of the movie with some over the top action sequences thrown in for good measure.    Bruce Willis' John McClane doenst even feel like McClane. Just like Axel Foley of Beverly Hills Cop III didnt feel like Axel Foley of the previous two Beverly Hills Cop movies. Its was a forced performance thats shows. In the previous three Die Hards, John McClane showed confidence in what he did. In this movie he seems like he is unsure of what he is doing.     The second complaint as that this didnt feel like a Die Hard movie. This felt like a botched up book-to-movie adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel. McClane seemed to be thrown in the mix as an afterthought.     Over the top action sequences are a staple of Die Hard movies but in this one they stretch the limits of credibility past the point of absurdity. The first three movies might have had some that stretch the limits of credibility but for the most part some of them were quite believable. This movie on the other hand has the silliest action sequences Ive seen in a long time which include:     *McClane launching a police car at a helicopter     *McClane jumping on top of a fighter jet    *McClane using an SUV to run over Thomas Gabriel's girlfriend and partner in crime Mai(Maggie Q)    * McClane using water from a fire hydrant to knock a gunner out of a helicopter    * McClane jumping off the jet and sliding down a concrete embankment and survives    The original John McClane would have killed Mai once he got the upper hand not run her over with a truck. Just goes to show you how much this director knows about John McClane.     Whereas in the previous films had some cool one-liners, the one-liners and wisecracks in this film border on stupid. Most of the time they dont even make sense.    An action movie is only as strong as its villian. The villain in this movie... what a sissy! I couldnt believe for one second that the d**khead that played Mickey in Scream 2 is a threat. Please. Steve Buscemi's front teeth are more intimidating than this guy. All he does is walk around with this constipated look on his face like he has a bad case of diarrhea. He was a total wimp only rivaled by Drake in Blade Trinity in terms of sheer cowardice. Hans Gruber, Col. Stuart and Simon Peter Gruber were all great villains played well by great actors(Alan Rickman, William Sadler and Jeremy Irons). They had plans that made sense and when  they grow weary of McClane's heroics they faced him. This clown on the other hand was scared sh**less of McClane and the kidnapping of McClane's daughter and running far away from John proves my point perfectly. Why kidnap a cop's daughter if all you are going to do is run from him? I didnt want to see McClane fight this wimp because it would have been like watching Zab Judah fight Perez Hilton. Embarrassing.    The scene where he tricks McClane's daughter into thinking he will rescue her from a stuck elavator was downright laughable. The face he made while he glances back at McClane through computer screen made me laugh hysterically. I havent laughed this hard at pure cheese since Hercules threw a bear into outer space.    Where did the henchmen come from? In Die Hard and Die Hard With A Vengeance the henchmen were German militants. In Die Hard 2 they were military extremists that showed an unwavering loyalty to Esperanza. In this movie they're just there. So McClane is fighting a bunch of faceless mercs. Typical of Follywood movies these days.     Other problems include: McClane's daughter is shows different personalities throughout the film, Kevin Smith's character is completely unnecessary to the story, how powerful the movie makes Thomas Gabriel seem, The plot holes involving the electricity in the city, and the way McClane disposes of Thomas Gabriel at the end was flat out stupid.     These are the flaws that make Live Free Or Die Hard a chore to watch. On the website where I saw this movie for free this movie had a 5 star average with a percentage 2056 votes in counting with the previous Die Hard movies have four star average a piece which shows you the who this movie was made to appeal to: The MTV generation. I have the first three Die Hards on DVD and Im content with that. As far as I'm concerned there never was a fourth Die Hard movie.
0307269981|5.0|If you can suspend disbelief, this is a fantastic book.  Some of the action is simply unbelievable, but if you can get past that, then you'll love this book.  It hooks you almost immediately.  I found that I just couldn't put it down.  I liked it as much, if not better, than the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  Definitely recommended!
6304696515|4.0|Movie redeems itself in the last 20 minutes almost making you forgive the first hour and a half that you must suffer through.    Namely you will suffer through Malkovich's gaudy American accent as he goes around deflowering virgins in his flowery French turn-of-the-19th-century attire.  Perhaps this movie would have been better enjoyed with the French voice-over and subtitles. At least it would have lent some credibility to the detailed costumes and sets.    Second, most of the seducing and getting seducted that seems to be most of this movie comes off somewhat forced.  It's hard to beleive any woman could be seduced by Malkovich's character.  His overlong, lingering looks are enough to turn your stomach.      In Dangerous Liasons, you get to see a lot of Hollywood stars back in their prime.  You get to see \\"a lot\\" of Uma Thurman, almost worth the price of admission alone.  In spite of this, much of the acting is kind of wooden - bland accents not helping matters and the story is rather boring as well up until nearly the end of movie when everything is finally put into perspective, and some of the acting actually gets pretty good (Close in particular).  It takes a long time to generate much suspense or interest. Or beleivablility!  A man who goes through the task of deflowering both Uma Thurman AND Michelle Pfeifer for the sole purpose of getting a roll in the hay with Glenn Close?!  Come on!! OK, I'm joking.  By the end of the movie we have a deeper understanding of the characters (and certainly more than enough time invested in them) and can all the more savor the final ironies.  It still gives me chills to think of the closing scene with Glenn close wiping off her make-up.      Let me just say that prior to the ending of this movie I was ready to give it a whopping 3 stars.  The movie ends so well however that I nearly forgot all the gripes I'd been compiling the first long hour and a half.      A little background prior to seeing this movie would have helped. From the footnotes in the special features:    \\"France was under the rule of King Louis XVI when Choderlos de Laclos wrote 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' in 1782.  Marie Antoinette was queen.\\"
0307266303|5.0|I bought this book because I saw the author on The Daily Show (he did get right up after the interview and left which I have never seen anybody do before). I am a very new runner and it seems I can never get beyond beginner due to weather, or other life events and yes, injury. So I said what the heck, let me read what the author has to say. I found the book entertaining and easy to read, but it started to drag after awhile. I didn't think there was exaggeration, and I don't think he said to run barefoot, but presented it as what others have done, he clearly did not run barefoot himself. There is one reason why I think he is right about the shoe companies and that comes from an experience I had myself with doing something, well, not so smart. On the spur of the moment I agreed to run with my husband and daughter in a 9 mile practice race for a mini-marathon. Hadn't run since Jr High, but sure I'll do it it my cheap $40 non-running shoe Adidas'. Other than my quadriceps being totally fried I had no problems or pain, my husband and daughter, in their $140 running shoes, on the other hand, did have problems. I also thought of the shoes Michael Johnson wore in the Olympics, those weren't much more than ballet slippers(yeah he was a sprinter, but you get my point).     I did look at the pictures on allwedoisrun and noticed Scott lands heel first and Arnulfo lands with his entire foot. If I am not mistaken I thought this was the problem that most runners have according to the author, there was something about going up or down stairs on his tiptoes because his heels were messed up and another part where I thought he said if he could learn to spring off the  front of his foot. He also mentioned that when he saw these two run together they ran exactly alike. Maybe I am over analyzing.     As for the Tarahumara what I found odd was that I pictured people living with nothing and then near the end of the book it seemed there was a small, primitive city at the bottom of the canyon.     I found the evolution part interesting because I always thought humans were never made to run, it was bad for you and could kill you, like Jim Fixx. That was my excuse for not running all my life anyway. The author does make a good point, or I think Eric said it, people get hurt because they don't know what they are doing, but how much of the problem is the shoes? I plan on testing this theory further, though probably not barefoot.
B00020QXDG|4.0|On March 20, 1974, Elvis Presley performed a concert in Memphis which was recorded and released as an album.  It was a good concert that was typical of the kind of concert that Elvis performed at the time.  The concert was slightly longer than an hour, so it had to be edited to released as an album.  This \\"fan club\\" release features the complete concert for the first time ever.  This makes the album better than ever.  Here is the complete track listing:<br /><br />1. Also Sprach Zarathustra<br />2. See See Rider<br />3. I Got a Woman/Amen<br />4. Love Me<br />5. Trying to Get to You<br />6. All Shook Up<br />7. Steamroller Blues<br />8. Teddy Bear/Don't Be Cruel<br />9. Love Me Tender<br />10. Long Tall Sally/Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On/Your Mama Don't Dance/Flip, Flop and Fly/Jailhouse Rock/Hound Dog<br />11. Fever<br />12.

B002GPNQXU|5.0|I am a 22 year old woman, and I can honestly say I love this album!! My favorite songs are Got Dynamite, World of Chances, and Falling Over Me. She has alot of different music styles on here to make a complete album. Out of all the Disney Stars she has the best voice that is not synthezied. Great purchase!!!

B000MRAAJW|5.0|If you still own a TOSHIBA HD-DVD player like me, PLANET EARTH: THE COMPLETE SERIES (HD DVD) will justify keeping it, besides playing standard DVD's. The four discs included, for less than 20$ (instead of the asking price of 80/100$ for the BLU-RAY) is the best bargain on the market for the nature and great scenery lovers. Like me, you'll play it over and over again, discovering new things every time.[[ASIN:B000E5KUJ2 Chronos [HD DVD]]]

B000KCHZK6|4.0|Norah Jones is one of the few musicians or bands putting out music today who appeal to those of us who have a little more out of the mainstream tastes, shall we say, and simultaneously to the masses.  The ability to do that takes special talent.    This is the type of record you can listen to as background music or enjoy peeling away its layers on the headphones.  I can't think of too many records which work that way.    Her voice will sink into your consciousness, and stick with you forever.    I don't like all of her records, but this one's for the most part consistent from beginning to end.     Great place to start if you don't have any other Norah Jones albums.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Turtle Beach has a pretty good track record of producing quality electronics, and with their latest offering, they certainly do not disappoint.    DESIGN: The X41s feature an attractive ear cup design which feature comfortable cushioning that do not cause ear sweating nearly as much as other headsets. The set sits perfectly on the receiver and deceptively fits into small spaces, which is always a plus.    SOUND QUALITY: The sole reason for picking up these bad boys. Featuring multi-channel audio that recreates Dolby 7.1 surround sound, the audio experience you will have this set will blow you away! Having tested them with Battlefield 1943, Halo 3, Wolfenstein, Left4Dead, BLACK, Fable II, Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, and a few films (i.e. Hellboy II and Beowulf) I can say without a doubt, that this set does not disappoint. Every bullet, every footstep, every single click of the trigger and every crackle of a flame is produced with crystal clarity and separated depending on distance, intensity, and player position. As a plus, voice chat can be adjusted separately from the main audio. Simply put, these headphones will place you into the heart of battle!    VALUE: At $199.99 I can see this pair being pricey for most, it was a scrape for me too! But having taken the plunge and experienced them first hand, they've proven to be worth every penny! If you live an apartment where sound travels, tend to play late at night but don't want to wake others, or simply want to enjoy your entertainment to its fullest, Turtle Beach's X41s will satisfy your every auditory need!

B001E2JNA6|5.0|I recently purchased the Blue-Ray version of this wonderful adapation and was absolutely delighted with what I saw.  In the old DVD version, the scenery and characters were either yellowed, or completely washed out. With the new Blue-Ray however, the details and colors are so sharp and vidid, they literally pop out at you.  I was able to notice even the smallest of details, from the small flowers on Mrs. Bennett's gown, to the links in the chain around Elizabeth's neck.  According to the extras included, the Blue-Ray version was restored from the movie negatives themselves, allowing us to see everything exactly as the director intended, making the time and effort they put into this restoration well worth it. I own this series on VHS, DVD and the special edition DVD; None of which compare to the new Blue-Ray.  Well worth the investment.
B002L1BJHY|5.0|I've been a fan of JET since Get Born came out in 2003/2004. They were unlike any band I'd heard at the time because they mixed classic rock guitar riffs with today's modern popular music. The songs had attitude, they were anthemic, and boy were they catchy. When Shine On was released in 2006, I appreciated the album's heavier subject matter and more mature sound. It wasn't quite as raw as Get Born, but they were still quality tunes.    And now with 2009's Shaka Rock JET are back bigger and better than ever. And I honestly mean that. Every single song on Shaka Rock is solid and worthy of the 3 year wait between albums. The guitar licks are still there, the anthemic choruses are just as fun to sing along to, and the guys sound great. They have created their own unique sound while at the same time not straying from their trademark style. There's really only 1 slow song on the whole album, which is the fantastic & heartfelt \\"She Holds A Grudge.\\" All the other songs are mid-to-fast tempo and make you want to get up & dance. I will admit \\"K.I.A.\\" and \\"Beat On Repeat\\" took some getting used to initially, but after a few listens I can tell you they are great as well. \\"She's A Genius\\" is made for radio and \\"Black Hearts (On Fire)\\" should undoubtedly be their next single. It's so well done and it rocks hard. I could go through all the songs and praise them individually, but you should just buy this album! If you liked Get Born you will find a lot to like about Shaka Rock. I know we just got this one, but I can't wait for their 4th record!
B00005Q4CS|3.0|Sorry Hubert but see, Requiem for a Dream might be seen as interesting, from a standpoint of, say, film technique. The photography, the editing, the acting, all superb. In that sense, the DVD is great becuz some of those extras? about filming and writing? are more interesting than the film itself. But storywise, major disappointment Hubert--just one or two scenes dragged out to fill an hour and a half, beating and beating the same campy message as that movie, Reefer Madness I mean, it's filmed much more stylishly than that, you know, but you see what I mean. And what's the deal with that soundtrack, that weird ominous music? Hubert, really. Do drug addicts hear string quartets in their heads all day? Whatareya trying to make here? A horror movie? With an old lady taking speed from her doctor, and talking to the TV? It has such a great, poetical title. I really expected, given the fact that so many successful people are addicted to these very drugs, you'd try to show how addiction destroys the pursuit of dreams. I mean, with a title like that...But these characters, they had no real dreams to pursue. They did nothing at all with themselves all day. Nothing, Hubert! Nothing! Not to mention that they were bone-chillingly stupid. Don't get me wrong--Ellen Burstyn was great. It's just that given the amount of speed she was taking over just a few months, it doesn't make sense, what she does. Do you actually know anyone who has taken speed for a few months? And the girl who becomes a whore - puleez. Girls who look like her have much better options when they decide to be a drug whore. Hubert, you were just trying to make a splash. Admit it. You were just trying to make us scared. But you made me laugh, Hubert. You really did. This sh** really sells, you were right. You don't even have to know what you're talking about. You just have to put it out there. People eat this sh** up!  Man, you're doing it, man. Wish I could, too. I really do.
B000QZTK28|5.0|What more can be said about this?  Simply put, this is one of the top 20 albums of ALL TIME.  I play this for 20-year old music students of mine, and the response is always the same: \\"WHO are these guys!!? This is one of the best albums I've EVER heard!\\"  It's a shame that The Minutemen -- and this record in particular -- languish in obscurity, while so much utterly mediocre so-called \\"alternative\\" fare surrounds us.    One thing that stands out on the record (among the MANY!) is this: D's guitar playing! It's on this record that he really shows how much he had matured (in a good way!) as a guitarist.  It's really quite extraordinary and dare I say even virtuosic, while still both *rockin'* and sensitive.  Keep in mind that both these were traits highly *frowned* upon within the \\"punk\\" and \\"alt\\" scenes at the time.  It wasn't \\"cool\\" or \\"punk\\" to play the guitar as well as D did.  The other exception was Curt Kirkwood, of fellow SST band-mates The Meat Puppets.    Anyway, one of the best of all time.
0140177396|5.0|This classic novel tells the tragic tale of Lennie Small and George Milton. They are out of luck and out of work migrant workers roaming the highways of California during the 1920s. The depression is the backdrop for the story but that does not prevent Lennie and George from dreaming big. Steinbeck paints a masterful and brilliant portrait of a bygone era that still resonates today. Every time I read this book it reads differently. This is required reading for most high schools. Fifteen years after I originally read I still love it. However, the difference between reading it at 14 and 28 is amazing. Lennie and George are some of the best characters of 20th Century Literature. I highly reccommend picking this one up.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I can't believe I wasted $30 of my hard-earned money on this thing! Not only does it not pick up much of anything, but the batteries only lasted a few days. And now I find out that I can't replace them with regular batteries. I have to buy a battery pack for $20 more! I'm throwing this trash in the trash!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I'm not going into detail on this review, I'm just helping the pitiful 4 star rating out. Yeah It's simpler than the old Radiohead albums, but every album has been very unique in themselves.  I find it to be their most R&B esque album where Thom's voice shines more than ever.  Best listened to on a sunny day driving or isolated from other people at least by yourself on headphones.
B0029NY9YO|3.0|So, good movie and comic up until they back-peddled with Dr. Manhattan: \\"And yet, in each human coupling, a thousand million sperm vie for a single egg...Until your mother loves a man she has every reason to hate, and of that union, of the thousand million children competing for fertilization, it was you, only you, that emerged.\\" Oh, boy.  Liked it when he was indifferent to humanity.  Made a lot of insightful comments.  Then ends by saying that he might create some of his own, or something to that end.     Definitely worth the watch, for the intricacies. Truly, it is a layered film (and comic), and different from the usual Hollywood Factory.    Nay, on the music selection. Yuck: Dylan, Nena, Simon and Garfunk. For me, took me out of the moment.  Particularly, during the endless opening title sequence accompanied by Dylan's drone.  Dig?    Also, why go with Christian Bale's Batman voice for Rory?  Or Natalie Portman's voice dubbed for Laurie (haha).    Finally, Alan Moore-on.  What a doofus: not having his name attached to the film's credits?  Fine.  From now on, I shall attribute Watchmen to Dave Gibbons.  You sir, are the only creator, and man enough not to take yourself too seriously to have your name attached to this nice tribute to your comic.    cheers!  (this has been a pointless post.)
B000002UJQ|5.0|It's really hard to confirm this feeling but I really feel like this is the best progressive rock album ever.  At least since the 90's to now.  Every track has a different feeling to it.  Best listened to on headphones on an adventure in another country or somewhere beautiful you've never been before.
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book.  I picked it up on a whim. I had a gift card to spend and didn't have time to hunt around, and it was on the Best Sellers table.  This was a Christmas, and I didn't actually read it to my Cabo vacation at the end of March. I started it on the plane down there, and couldn't put it down the whole trip.  It was the PERFECT book for me to read on vacation, and although I was only 27 at the time, I felt that my life was in a transistion period similar to the authors mid-life-crisis!  I would lay on the beach, read a chapter, take a nap, ponder the meaning of life, and read another chapter.  It was truely delightful.<br /><br />I have since recommended it to 4 or 5 friends, and my boss!  I have to say, I have not had a bad review. Most of the time I get text messages at 2:30am saying \\"Why the hell did you recommend this book to me - I can't put it down and have to get up for work at 6am!\\".<br /><br />It's so good I'm going to read it again!
B001EN71DG|5.0|Listening to people complain about this trilogy is like listening to a Florida retiree complain about the humidity. Starting from the 1997 Special Editions: George CLEARLY stated that these were enhanced versions, digitally remastered with new scenes either re-added from the cutting room floor or digitally re-added. WHY did you go to see these movies in the theater, paying $9 a ticket to see something you knew went against your SW morals? Then, the fullscreen editions were released, followed by the widescreens (yes, these two sets could have been released at one time, I agree).     GL didn't force you to buy the Special Edition VHS's or see them in the theaters.     GL didn't trick you into buying either or both of the two DVD releases. You KNEW the Special Edition versions were probably going to be better quality than the unaltered, theatrical releases (which also look GREAT!! Who cares if they are not  true widescreen transfers???? They look OK to good on a tube tv and even greater on a Widescreen). You were going to eventually buy a WS TV anyway, so quit griping, you must!!!    Don't fear change. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, HATE....leads to suffering.     This is a great package, the transfers were wonderful, and the SW \\"purists\\" have the choice of watching a great DVD version of the unedited theatrical releases and those of us not old enough to see the originals in the theaters can appreciate both versions.
0446402397|4.0|This book already has tons of reviews, so I'll keep it short... I liked it a lot!  And I'm generally not into gross murder mysteries with all the blood and gore, but it was SO good. I couldn't put it down!
0385340575|3.0|Lee Childs is a great story teller and Jack Reacher is a really good story character.  The story Gone Tomorrow starts out with a simple suicide or is it?    Why is it a item of National Security?  What are the 12 points?  Are they real?  Who uses them?  Apparently with national security issues the FBI, CIA can do just about anything they want to you, and ask any questions on any subject with no questions asked.  Kinda scary. These are early questions that takes Lee Childs 200 pages to set-up explain and establist the story line.  This part of the book is drawn out and can easily loose the reader because the author is extremely detailed.  But hang in there, the story really takes off in chapter 43 and from there until the conclusion the story is like a roller coaster ride with twists and turns.  I thought the book had a really good story line but was about 100 pages to long.
B00007L4OM|4.0|`Wasabi', a film directed by Gerard Krawczyk and more importantly written by Luc Besson (`The Professional', `The Fifth Element', `La Femme Nikita') and starring Jean Reno (of many of the same films), is a French take on the American Dirty Harry / Axel Foley type of loose cannon policeman played by Jean Reno in place of Eastwood and Murphy. This may be a bit odd as Reno is much less the hot Murphy figure as he is the French equivalent of the modern Noir hero as played by Harvey Keitel. In fact, Reno and Keitel played exactly the same role in `La Femme Nikita' and the less successful American remake.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is that while the plots of `Dirty Harry' and `Beverly Hills Cop' are an interesting framework on which the rogue cop struts his stuff, the plot of `Wasabi' is almost inconsequential. That doesn't mean the film is not fun to watch, as Reno and his two primary supporting characters do great jobs of bulking up their characters to fill out the absence of a meaningful plot.<br /><br />The story, briefly, is based on Reno's character, Hubert Fiorentini, a Paris policeman and former French intelligence agent in Tokyo is summoned to Tokyo because he is the only beneficiary in the will of a Japanese girlfriend who jilted him 19 years earlier when they both worked in the French embassy in Tokyo, Reno as an intelligence operative and girlfriend as a crypographer.<br /><br />In Tokyo, we meet the second of the three main characters, an operative colleague of Fiorentini both were France's covert strongarms in Tokyo. Soon, when Hubert sees the lawyer probating the will, we meet the third major character, the 19 year old daughter of the Japanese code breaker and our Hubert. Daughter does not know Hubert is her father, and threatens to kill her father when she meets him. Daughter is a chip off the old Nikita character block, slightly younger, less larcenous, and certainly less dopy, but just as manic and irresponsible.<br /><br />The big surprise which drives what is taken for a plot in the movie is when Hubert discovers that dead girlfriend / mother has $200,000,000 in her Japanese bank accounts in trust for soon to be legally adult daughter. It seems, however,that this money was somehow taken from a Japanese gangster who does a rather poor imitation of Italian-American gangsters as depicted by directors far less talented or imaginative than Martin Scorsese or Frances Coppela. With a combination of the fact that our Nippon scarface (yes, he has prominent scars on his face) has relatively inept bodyguards and the fact that our hero Hubert is something of especially adept at fanciful means of incapacitating bad guys, Hubert is able to keep himself and daughter out of scarface's clutches for most of Act II.<br /><br />In the last act, with the help of some heavy duty hardware from the French Tokyo cold war stash of weapons and Hubert's Tokyo wingman, Hubert ultimately teletransfers the money out of the bad guys' clutches and take down the whole gang with help from his long dormant network of Tokyo operatives.<br /><br />The fact that it is so much fun to write this review is a sure sign that the movie is fun to watch, at least once. The problem is whether or not the DVD is worth buying. The thin plot never explains how dead girlfriend got the 200 million bucks from scarface or exactly how girlfriend died or what connection a hidden notebook had to the case or even why the seeming larceny occurred many years ago, as 4/5 of the loot was interest, which could only have accrued over many years.<br /><br />The point of the title is based on no more than a sight gag of Reno's character eating gobs of undiluted Wasabi with no sigh that he senses the very high heat in this Japanese horseradish. The point is made when faithful henchman eats a small portion himself and is rewarded with a scorched mouth which he demonstrates clearly with mumbles and large amounts of drinking water.<br /><br />Very few comedies wear well after multiple viewings. Aside from Shakespeare's comedies and Woody Allen movies, there are very few I consider worth owning, and this is not one of them, although I sincerely enjoyed the experience of watching it the first time, as I am something of a Jean Reno fan.<br /><br />Note that like most French movies, watching with the original French soundtrack and English subtitles is superior to watching the dubbed English, as you always loose something in the inflections of the dubbed speech. And, the two translations are different, and based on my rudimentary High School French, I think the subtitled translation is better.len movies, there are very few I consider worth owning, and this is not one of them, although I sincerely enjoyed the experience of watching it the first time, as I am something of a Jean Reno fan.

B0029358GM|5.0|Wilco has now become a staple of alternative music,  just like Death Cab For Cutie, they have carved out a sizable musical niche. They write their songs and play with extreme confidence.  They are one of those bands that know who they are, and their fans can either get on board or disembark.  Those that \\"get\\" them admire them. Those that don't feel that somehow Wilco abandoned its initial mission.  As I've always said in the past, each band's cd should be graded on its own merits, and not  compared to its previous efforts.  I don't love every song, but each one makes a statement that is strong and definite.  The rhythm section is tight, the vocals are clean, the guitar rings with purpose, especially on Bull Black Nova.  What more could you ask from a talented bunch of guys from Illinois?

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been using this video to work out for the last ten days or so, and it's been great! It's a tough 20 minutes, but I can feel the difference already. I used to be a regular gym-goer, but had totally fallen off the wagon for the last couple years - this has been a great way to get back into fitness in small increments. I was really sore the first two days, but after that, I have just been feeling good!    All the exercises are done in 30 second to one minute segments, so you never have time to get bored of any one thing. Also, as an extra-special bonus, none of her moves make my thigh fat rub together!    Sometimes her chatter gets annoying, but there is an option to just have the music and not the talking - plus, even though it's annoying to hear the perky motivational statements, they seem to actually motivate me!

0066620996|4.0|Written in 2001, Good to Great is a little out of date with case studies on Fannie Mae and Circuit City. I hope they are planning a second edition sometime soon. The book is encouraging in that it makes success seem much more attainable and almost inevitable with the right foundation. However, it also places so much importance on the people involved that it makes hiring seem like the single most critical and difficult task of running and growing a company.
0307408833|1.0|I own over 50 cookbooks and have never felt the need to type a review.  Until now.    I'm a decent baker.  I shop frequently at the local health foods grocery, so I'm familiar with tasty vegan pumpkin bread, vegan gluten free brownies, etc.  I thought I'd try out the signature vanilla cupcakes with vanilla frosting.  What did I get?    Misshapen bean pucks, denser than grout, bland as neutered Tofurky, topped with a slurry of fat shards suspended in a soy flood runoff.    When they say New York's finest, they must be referring to the cops, because it sure ain't these cupcakes.    Blech.
B0009IW9CK|1.0|However, he ends up coming up way short. This would begin his descent into mediocrity. I was never a big fan of \\"Pop Singer\\", but now I'm not a fan of this whole album. Mellencamp would mature from \\"Scarecrow\\" into \\"The Lonesome Jubilee\\" rather splendidly as he was trying to incorporate new instruments into his sound like a fiddle, accordian etc. and he did a good job of doing that, but he tried to do it some more, and he would fail. I guess he wanted to have America like his sound no matter what he put out, but there was one difference between \\"Lonesome Jubilee\\", and \\"Big Daddy\\", and that was at least \\"Lonesome Jubilee\\" rocked a bit. Here it's as dreary as rain on the roof.
1416972242|2.0|My problem with the first book rested with Clare's world-building, but this one allowed me to move on to actually not liking the characters.  Not because of their over-described beauty, but because they cease to act like responsible, logical people.  I don't mean logical adults or even logical teenagers, I mean that no one in their right mind would do some of the things the characters in this book do.  I read this series for a friend of mine, a young sort infatuated by the series.  That was kind of the only reason I did, and rest assured that she and I will be discussing what works and what doesn't and why.  There will be a lot of the latter.<br /> In my review of the first book, I went into detail about the Shadowhunters rather racist treatment of mundanes.  That the so-called guardians of mankind could look upon their protectorate with contempt didn't endear me to them as heroes, because, after all, I the reader would be one.  And I wouldn't want to meet a damn Shadowhunter if they were going to sneer at me every five seconds.  From a strictly literary standpoint, Valentine's hatred of Downworlders is somehow supposed to be this terrible, awful thing, but how are we supposed to get that when we see how the Shadowhunters behave?  Especially when they refer to helpless civilians in the same tone one would talk about a drooling idiot.  (Because, I'm certain, none of the Shadowhunters ever benefited from mundane inventions, like, say, swords, jackets, zippers, motorcycles, elastic, nylon, boots, etc.) Fantasy benefits from dichotomy, Ms. Clare.  And you gave me black and grey morality by mistake.<br /> I hated that Simon became a vampire.  Call it my despair event horizon.  Vampires don't do much for me (I might have been a little happier if he'd become a werewolf, but not by much), but it just seemed to drive the point home that Simon sucked and would always suck as long as he was a mundane.  (Until he became a vampire, which does literally suck, and that just seemed a hilariously sad metaphorical satire; purely unintentional on the part of the author, I'm sure.)  Heroes must be morally correct, more morally correct than the reader, and Clary's decision to let Simon become a vampire was ethically incorrect in my opinion.  As wrong as allowing an injured animal to suffer out of a human inability to let go.  The downside to being a vampire is rarely discussed in ideal worlds like Clare's and Meyers's, but the fact that Simon's religious beliefs were directly compromised by his change was terrible to me.  Clary allowed her friend, who had no choice in the matter, to become a monster, cursed with a half-life and banished from a world he actually liked living in.  Somehow, that was better than letting him simply die (and as far as religious beliefs/philosophy were concerned, letting him meet his God untainted).  Simon got dragged into the supernatural world by Clary; she had a responsibility to him, and seeing Clary deal with the actual repercussions of that would have been far more interesting than \\"You're a vampire, so that means everything's okay.  By the way, I let you live, you owe me.\\"  Easily the biggest disappointment of the series for me, because it just made the utter lack of responsibility on the part of the heroes resonate that much further.  They owed nothing to the mundanes, nothing to the Downworlders, and nothing to each other by their actions.  Trying to claim the opposite is nothing more than informed ability on the part of the author.  \\"They're really good and nice and heroic!\\"  The rule is show, don't tell.<br /> And further, the Clave is useless.  The higher ups, who should and would be concerned about youngsters mucking things up, can't do anything right.  And conveniently, it's everyone, not just the Inquisitor.  The Council's not paying attention, the Inquisitors are going crazy with power, and all these families who ought to care are all sitting in jury duty?  Not even the Army fails to post active troops like this; there's always a Lieutenant or a Colonel to inform when the General is busy.  It's clumsy world-building, and we see it clunking along on every page.  This is why the story can't be serious, because the author can't be bothered to make it so.  The characters are playing in this world, not living in it and suffering in it, because none of the ethical, moral, and emotional ramifications of most of the stuff that happens is explored at all.  Instead we get \\"I want to sleep with my sister!'\\"  \\"No!  I mean ... yes ... no wait!  Yes. Aw, crap!\\"  (And while it might have squicked some people that the author wouldn't leave it alone, I figured out halfway through book 2 that they weren't brother and sister at all.

When you write fanfiction, you can't suck even when you do, and that's a bad environment to be fostered in.there's always a Lieutenant or a Colonel to inform when the General is busy.  It's clumsy world-building, and we see it clunking along on every page.  This is why the story can't be serious, because the author can't be bothered to make it so.  The characters are playing in this world, not living in it and suffering in it, because none of the ethical, moral, and emotional ramifications of most of the stuff that happens is explored at all.  Instead we get \\"I want to sleep with my sister!'\\"  \\"No!  I mean ... yes ... no wait!  Yes. Aw, crap!\\"  (And while it might have squicked some people that the author wouldn't leave it alone, I figured out halfway through book 2 that they weren't brother and sister at all.

1416955070|2.0|***SPOILERS HEREIN***<br /><br />Great fantasy explores the human condition realistically, no matter the fantastic setting.  Ultimately, I can say this was the failing of the series.  I was given the series by a prot&eacute;g&eacute;' of mine, and read it in order to be able to talk about it with her.  And while Clare doesn't offend nearly as much as Paolini or Meyer, she definitely deserves to take their coats.  Hang out with them, perhaps over describe a cappuccino.  After a quick peruse of the Draco in Leather Pants trope on TVTropes, I became aware of Clare's role in the HP fandom and the scandal that dogged her.  I found it humorous, but the fact that she is friends in real life with the far more talented Holly Black and Libba Bray makes me wonder if she's the third wheel of their little writing group.  As in, the wheel that can't take critique and gets an in with their literary agent, Barry Goldblatt.<br /><br />I think the largest thing that bothered me about the series was the treatment of the mundanes.  It was thinly veiled racism that we were somehow to supposed to swallow because the Shadowhunters were awesome and cool.  I dare you to replace \\"mundane\\" or \\"mundies\\" with any other racial epithet of your choice and watch what sort of unfortunate implications spring up.  Simon's treatment at the hands of Clary's new friends, and Clary's utter inability or desire to defend him, made her fail in my sight as a heroine.  Rowling handled racism in a believable way in her fantasy world; fantastic racism is still racism.  But the implications of said racism are not handled or acknowledged at all by Clary's Shadowhunter society, despite the fact that it's in a contemporary setting that would, and should, mind it very much.  ***SPOILER ALERT*** When Simon kills the Greater Demon by using a bow, the others congratulate him a manner that suggests Simon's mundane status were a sort of crippling retardation he managed to overcome; that simply by not being a Shadowhunter he was incapable of simple things like dexterity, motor skills, or strategy.  Ms. Clary, the history of warfare would like a word with you, since I'd imagine mundanes did come up with spears and swords before the Nephilim were created.  ***END SPOILER***<br /><br />Call me a hyperbolic individual if you must in light of all that, but the fact that the Shadowhunters thought mundanes contemptible, pitiable idiots did nothing to provide a \\"good\\" foil for Valentine's so-called \\"evil\\" hatred for Downworlders.  Apparently it's okay to hate the unaware losers exactly like the ones reading the book, but don't be mean to vampires, werewolves, and faeries.  Then you're just a monster.  Can you see why this kind of fell flat for me?  Ruined the stakes and everything.  In fact, it made me wonder why the Shadowhunters didn't enslave humanity, or turn all of them into Shadowhunters using the Mortal Cup, especially since being a mundane was such a lamentable, stupid state to exist in.<br /><br />On that same note, there was too much of a You Suck taint buried in the book.  I mean, in all truth, shallow high-school hijinks between a group of teenagers were causing them to abandon each other in life or death situations.  Real life teenagers are capable of more than this, you know.  Isabelle not looking out for Simon (Simon the mundane, in case you forgot!) at a party was one of the worst offenders, and Jace and Clary heading off by themselves to rescue him came pretty close to worst, but there were too many times that someone decided \\"I don't like you!\\" and stomped off in a huff, leaving the other members of their would-be nakama in the lurch.  Again, for a society supposedly raised on warfare and soldier-esque brotherhood, with individuals supposed to be living in a time of active war, these teenagers were far too willing to abandon their comrades and their common sense.  It made things come across as a non-too-kindly commentary on modern youth, especially taking into account, oh,I don't know, the 18 and 17 year olds in World War 2 that got medals for valor?  To me, it just felt like Clare was reminding us that these kids were dressing up and playing Underworld, especially when no one showed strong leadership, the ability to reconcile others, and the ability to rally in times of panic.  (Jace's snark doesn't count as leadership; I don't care how charming he might be.)  The Shadowhunters had no sense of honor, of loyalty, (Dare I say kindness to the less privileged?) or of any of the other things that were supposed to make us regard them as heroic figures.<br /><br />I handle poor characterization much better than I do poor world-building; poor world-building makes a reader question too much.  And far too often I found myself asking \\"Why the hell isn't this happening instead?  How have they survived for this long acting like this?  How could their society!?\\"  And so, while I could forgive Clare's jerkass Jace, vapid Clary, and doormat Simon, I couldn't forgive her foolish lack of logic when it came to suspension of disbelief. While Clare's offenses in prose were not as egregious as Paolini or Meyer, she still fails to tell a story more meaningful than a high-school relationship.  And a vapid one at that, with lots of attempts at trying to be Joss Whedon.n World War 2 that got medals for valor?

1594202249|3.0|Thomas Pynchon transports readers of his new novel, Inherent Vice, to the early 1970s in Southern California. He captures the mood of that time in many dimensions, especially in the form of drugs, rock and roll and movies. There must be references to four dozen songs that will delight music lovers. Pynchon's prose is word perfect, the dialogue perfect for the era, and the plots were hilarious. Protagonist Larry Doc Sportello is larger than life, mellow on weed, and in the thick of so many subplots that each successive one is funnier than the one before. The names of Pynchon's characters were also funny, and the presence of the early Internet will make even geeks laugh. Inherent Vice provides an amusing and entertaining excursion to a place and time that seems more amusing and quaint now than it seemed at the time.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
0345479092|1.0|&#34;I wish I could tell my new-mom self a lot of things: That the moment you stop letting expert voices drown out your own instincts is the moment you embrace parenthood. That your kids will tell you what they need. That those needs will never, ever fit into a predictable schedule. That the needs will change by the day, and that the sooner you embrace that truth, the happier you'll be.&#34; - Heidi Stevens<br /><br />I wish I'd known then what I know now. This book should have been called &#34;Lies of a Glorified Nanny: How to Frustrate, Alienate and Malnourish Your Baby.&#34; Much of its advice is scientifically and psychologically wrong: it goes directly against the recommendations of the AAP and contradicts many facts about child development. So parents must ask: even if these methods &#34;work&#34; for your baby, are they HEALTHY? The answer is no. You can get the same results from much better books (like Weissbluth and Pantley). I am not a fan of &#34;attachment parenting&#34; either, which is at the opposite extreme, but at least that method ensures that all your baby's needs are met, unlike this one.<br /><br />Most babies unless they're colicky will adapt to pretty much anything, which is what I think accounts for the rave reviews of this book. A coworker gave me this book and raved about it. I had a very positive opinion of it while pregnant, and used Hogg's &#34;E.A.S.Y. routine&#34; for about 3 months after our baby was born. Unfortunately, she had acid reflux (causing extreme colic) and I had post-partum depression. I believe that following the advice in this book made things much worse than they otherwise would have been.<br /><br />I naively believed that a book like this wouldn't be published if it contained irresponsible information in it that could be harmful to babies. Now I know better; the #1 baby book in the U.S. from 1894-1940 had strict instructions not to kiss or cuddle your baby, or play with them before 4 months old, and other such bad advice. The premise of Hogg's book sounds great, and the things she first writes about, such as treating your baby like a person, and slowing down to focus on baby care, are things everyone can agree on. That along with her friendly &#34;British nanny&#34; writing style, and high praise from famous people, are likely to make a new parent mistakenly think that the rest of her advice is sound.<br /><br />So here's a word of wisdom born of experience (especially for the research-aholics out there like me): Don't get totally gung-ho or self-righteous about any one parenting method or &#34;plan&#34; before your baby is born (or even after)! Every baby and every family is different, and a mix of approaches is usually what people end up doing. I shouldn't have been hung up on following this or any other &#34;methodology&#34; out there. I should have trusted my own instincts more and been more flexible. I am sure, looking back, that if I hadn't gotten so caught up in trying to follow any particular prescribed method, our whole family would have enjoyed those first few months together more. So I take responsibility for how I allowed this book to negatively affect our family. But for the benefit of people who are considering reading this book, I want to point out some of the wrong things in this book that I didn't know when I read it.<br /><br />1) The author has no baby care credentials other than being a nanny. The only reason she got to publish a book is that she became a popular nanny for some famous actors in Hollywood. Her other so-called credentials are fabricated. She left her two young daughters back in England to move here, which to me is more than enough of a reason to reject her parenting advice. Her life and her book make it clear that she views child-rearing as a &#34;disruption.&#34; She claims that &#34;by taking the proper steps, babies don't have to be disruptive. You should be able to lead a normal life.&#34; (&#34;Cries and Whispers,&#34; Newsweek 2001 - available on their website). This false premise that you can live like you did before having a baby is, I think, the foundation for all the wrong things in the book. It's not possible to do that without either neglecting or having someone else take care of your baby. She is also contradicting herself because in the book she stresses the need to be prepared for way your life will radically change with a baby.<br /><br />2) Hogg says that you must &#34;start as you mean to go on&#34;--that you must put your baby on the routine you want them to have when they are older. If you &#34;coddle&#34; your baby by letting them sleep on you, eat more frequently, etc. you will not be able to get them into a more manageable routine when they are older. Of course having no experience with children, this made total sense to me. But it is absolutely untrue as anyone with a knowledge of child development will tell you. Newborns are VERY different from 3 month olds. And babies are VERY different from 1 and 2 year olds. Their needs are completely different, and their habits are completely different. Not giving your newborn a routine does NOT mean they can't get on a routine when they are older. She calls this lack of routine &#34;accidental parenting,&#34; but when it comes to the health and happiness of a newborn, being an &#34;accidental&#34; parent is far better than using the E.A.S.Y. routine.<br /><br />3) The E.A.S.Y. routine. The basis of it is to feed your baby only every 3 hours, although the details are a lot more complicated than that and certainly not easy. The main problems with it are:<br />- It is totally unnecessary. Numerous scientific studies show that infant sleep patterns are not related to food at all. The timing of feedings does NOT matter to babies' developing sleep patterns! The E.A.S.Y. routine--which was developed by Hogg in her role as a NANNY, not a parent--is only for the adults' benefit, so they can have a predictable schedule. And even that can backfire, since a lot of babies will eat a lot of food in a couple of hours and then sleep for 4-5 hours, which is better for the parents than if they were waking every 3 hours.<br />- It is NOT intuitive. I spent lots of unnecessary time and energy keeping logs/charts/schedules etc to try to follow it. She actually had to write a second book in order to clarify it because so many readers were confused about it --[[ASIN:0743488946 The Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems: Sleeping, Feeding, and Behavior--Beyond the Basics from Infancy Through Toddlerhood]]--and yes, I read that one too! In that one, she even admits that the E.A.S.Y. routine isn't actually easy, because so many parents had problems with it.<br />- It can really cause problems with a colicky baby, and/or if you are breastfeeding. With colicky babies, sometimes the only soothing thing for them is suckling, which in her book isn't allowed between feedings (and neither are swings). You're supposed to start the routine when the baby is three days old, but sometimes breastmilk doesn't come in for over a week! My milk never really came in, and if I hadn't been trying to keep to a strict routine, especially as far apart as 3 hours, it probably would have helped my milk production. Scheduled breastfeeding can  interfere with the initiation of milk. I never got more than 2 oz at a time. Three different lactation nurses at three different visits said that the baby and I were doing everything right. I was pumping frequently with a hospital machine. I tried everything one can try, including that special tea, except simply feeding her more often. My baby had failure to thrive so I ended up having to stop trying to breastfeed after 4 weeks, and go to hypoallergenic formula. Other reviewers have also said their babies had failure to thrive while on the E.A.S.Y. routine. NOT GOOD!<br /><br />Some kind of routine is not a bad thing, but wait till your baby is at least 6 weeks old, and then transition to one gradually. There is agood one in [[ASIN:0399532919 The Baby Sleep Solution: A Proven Program to Teach Your Baby to Sleep Twelve Hours aNight]]; just ignore the 4 hour feeding part as it's not necessary or healthy.<br /><br />4) Hogg says that it's imperative to respond immediately to babies whenever they cry, no matter what. If you don't do this, you are being a bad parent, and breaking your baby's trust in you. She stresses this repeatedly throughout the book. Well, after reading information from the AAP, and talking to our pediatrician, my counselor and other parents, I finally figured out that this was totally false--even pediatricians know it's not true. It felt like the weight of the universe had been lifted off my shoulders! I've never liked the &#34;cry-it-out&#34; approach. But Hogg's advice is too extreme on the other end of the spectrum, and just as bad. With a colicky baby, they are going to cry almost no matter what you do; with ours it was about every 30 minutes. And if you can't get a break, you get no sleep, which impairs your parenting ability, and in many cases (about 40% of women) also your mental health. Believing that every cry had to be attended to immediately caused me to be much more stressed and anxious and guilty than I would otherwise have been. This is in no small part because she gives a bunch of other advice that is likely to cause a baby to cry (unless they're very mellow), such as only feeding every 3 hours, having them only ever sleep in a crib, and putting them down as soon as they stop crying. It's a very stressful Catch-22. The scene of my weeks-old baby lying in her crib screaming, when I could have just picked her up and let her lie with me and nursed her and she would have stopped, plays in my mind as I write this.<br /><br />5) Speaking of crying, Hogg's soothing methods did not work at all for us. They were just frustrating and exhausting. Just like so many other things, what works for one baby might not work for another baby, and despite Hogg's claims, her methods clearly don't work for all babies. And they are really odd. Like, you're not supposed to rock backward and forward. You're supposed to use very specific sounds and pats (not rubs) in a certain pattern. Looking back I see how silly it is. Who comes up with this stuff? Oh yeah, people like Hogg trying to make a buck.<br /><br />6) The section on interpreting a baby's cries didn't help either, and it's certainly not unique, since a lot of other better books say the same things about how to interpret crying. (If you really want to correctly interpret your baby's cries, get the DVD set [[ASIN:B000PDZ9SU Dunstan Baby Language--Learn the universal language of newborn babies]]. I started using it at the tail end of when it works--for babies up to 3 months old--but I remember the surprised look on my baby's face when I gave her exactly what she needed right away!)<br /><br />7) Hogg compartmentalizes babies into various &#34;types&#34; like Angel, Grumpy, etc. This never sat well with me. I don't like the idea of pigeon-holing a child like that, especially not so early on when they're still developing and they could be very different in a year or so. I couldn't in the least tell what personality my baby had, because she was just in pain most of the time! And it's not even necessary; you will naturally pick up what works best with your baby without having to sequester them into a category and then read a chart on how to handle babies in that category. Hogg also says this personality in your baby is what they will have throughout their lifetime. But that is certainly not true either. I'd have labeled my baby Grumpy, whereas at 2 1/2 she'd be in the Angel category if I had to choose. And everyone who knows her always comments on how happy and easygoing she is.<br /><br />8) Overall, this book gives the impression that you have no internal resources for caring for a child and that you need detailed schedules and charts to follow for every aspect of life witha baby. Obviously some aspects of basic baby care do have to be learned and aren't instinctive. But Hogg's book goes beyond basic baby care and advises many things that are unnecessary at best and damaging at worst. This can easily make new parents feel less confident and more guilty and anxious, which they probably feel too much of already without a book adding to it. She may have written that parents should follow their instincts, but the fact that she felt the need to give such overly detailed instructions shows that she didn't really think parents actually do have instincts. The small bits of sound advice in the book are nothing more than stuff that any good parent could tell you, and that you'd probably do naturally anyway; basic common-sense stuff.<br /><br />P.S.

1400063736|4.0|Colum McCann's new novel, Let the Great World Spin, presents the voices of multiple characters connected in ways that prove that even in a huge city like New York, we live in community and have an impact on the lives of those around us. The voices of multiple characters present dimensions of a time in 1974 that are true to that time and remind us of our lives today. Tying together each voice is the highwire stunt of Philippe Petit when he walked on a tightrope between the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center. The cast of characters presents the city and the community in its fullness: young artists; hookers on drugs trying to raise children; a street priest; a Park Avenue judge; a support group of women who lost sons in the Vietnam War. Love, sorrow, redemption and understanding fill the pages of Let the Great World Spin. As McCann notes on page 349, \\"The world spins. We stumble on. It is enough.\\" However you stumble along in this world, one or more characters will resonate with you and your life. McCann's lyrical writing soars, and there's great satisfaction and joy to be found in reading Let the Great World Spin.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)

1416914307|1.0|Well, even when the professional reviews say an author suffers from predictability and overblown writing, there's only so high an author can hold their head.  Ha!  I read this series for a younger friend of mine, who was very excited about it.  I'm looking forward to discussing this series with her, but if I said I wasn't also having fun skewering it myself I'd be lying.  Most of what bothered me has been discussed already in my previous reviews: black and grey morality (Valentine is \\"evil\\" because he wants to destroy all Downworlders, but Shadowhunters sneer viciously at mundanes and disenfranchise Downworlders; how are they the heroes again?) , the You Suck (Hey, teenagers!  You're not capable of doing anything without suffering an unnecessary amount of angst over high-school level priorities that you shouldn't have in the first place because you KILL VAMPIRES ON A REGULAR BASIS!), poor world-building (Right, since ALL the Clave is busy in jury duty, no one's watching the helm of the world; they leave it up to a handful of inexperienced youths that they refuse to listen to despite said youths being on the front lines of the war.  Even the Army's not this bad.), and sociopathic heroes. (Yes, Clary, allowing your friend Simon to resurrect as a vampire was clearly the ethical thing to do, and we're all very glad you didn't suffer any lasting effects from screwing him over.  And Simon, we're glad that your Jewish heritage means so little to you that you can't even muster getting pissed off at Clary when you can't say \\"God\\", even when cursing because the freaking Star of David scorched you.  And Jace, your ethics being clouded by your sister's hot bod would make you morally dubious, except that it's an extremely obvious ploy by the author to show us how wangsty you get over NOTHING.)<br /> The biggest snort moment for me was when Max died.  (Yeah, yeah, spoiler; what, you were actually looking for one in this series?  Spoilers don't exist for it.)  Max was a Red Shirt with character development, the sacrificial lamb that said nothing and did nothing significant for three books.  He was meant to die to show us how evil the bad guys were.  (Personally, I think if Church had died it would have saved the same purpose; he got about the same level of character development and he was a cat.)  But after seeing how the main characters interacted with Max the whole time, it just didn't strike me as anything more than clumsy, emotional string-plucking by the author.  They told him to get out just about every time Max showed up, because they were dealing with Shadowhunter stuff.  His onscreen time would fill all of five pages.  And of course, don't forget when Max tried to tell everyone about the guy climbing the tower; they treated him exactly like they did before.  \\"Go to bed, Max.\\"<br /> I had already figured out that Jace and Clary weren't brother and sister back in Book 2, but Book 3 really suffers from the author attempting to make plot twists.  She goes so far in one direction that we can't help but figure out what's going to happen .  It's like she meets herself coming and going.  Sebastian is super-sweet, kind, nice, diplomatic, a non-threatening Jace?  How could he POSSIBLY BE A BAD GUY!?  Jace and Clary keep talking about how hard it sucks that they're brother and sister and can never be together?  How could they POSSIBLY END UP TOGETHER!?  Jace is dead? Again? How could he POSSIBLY LIVE!?  And so on.<br /> As a final world-building nitpick, why did Clare give the Clave (man, I'm suddenly discovering a lot of egotistical alliteration here) a democratic/council structure when every single commander is corrupt?  Usually, corruption is EASIER to catch in that kind of setup; she should have just made the Shadowhunters a tyrannical despot.  That would have made a lot more sense and provided a lot more justification for the heroes' convenient abandonment by their superiors for three straight books.  As a final, tiny bit of kindness, I did like the Biblical background for the Shadowhunters, particularly the Mark of Cain being turned on its head as a good thing, a blessing.  The Angel's appearance was also cool and well-done; I liked the rune setup and the naming of the seraph blades.  Those ideas were well-executed and original.<br />It's a shame it's the only bit of the series that was.he Biblical background for the Shadowhunters, particularly the Mark of Cain being turned on its head as a good thing, a blessing.

B00000JKH2|5.0|I bought this album in 2001, after hearing so many people talking about at The Drive In. I didn' start with RoC because everyone was so crazy about it, so i figured it was better to keep the best for last.    At the time i was addicted on mailordering CD's from indie labels in america. I live in Paris. As soon as i opened the package, i instantly loved the picture. Inserted the CD in my CD player, which was a really good one. It was an instant shock. I was electrified, petrified, i had never heard something like this and i didn't know how to react. I almost cried.    The raw sound of guitars, the energy mixed with this cold and heart-stopping emotion, these completely crazy lyrics, riffs and guitar fills that look like nothing else i know (and in fact influences seem not to be their key inspiration), the pure and uncesored rage to live of Cedric bixler. It suddenly made half the bands i was listening to sound lousy commercial and overdone, because these guys had so much raw energy, and it was so pure. It's what the 1990's were all about. If you think of Nirvana when it first came out, it was the same rage and punk energy. But ATDI went one step further in terms of musical exploration, and reached unknnown territories. If you think of underground bands that ended up having a huge musical impact, you could talk about Joy Division in the 80's, The velvet Underground in the 70's, and ATDI in the 1990's. This band already is a legend.    RoC turned out to be a truly great album. But in the end, vaya has always been and still is the biggest musical shock i have ever had. Two years later, the first album of the mars volta was released. The same thing happened again. I just couldn't believe what i was hearing. It just killed me I just can't believe these guys exist. And when i think of all these suckers that were claiming \\"rock is dead\\" at the time. The 90's turned out to be the most active period ever in the history of RnR.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I received my order within the same week and it was exactly what i expected..GREAT MOVIE my favorite
B000N0WCLC|3.0|We really enjoyed the story, learning about the violence, depravity, corruption, and cruelty that goes into the diamond trade. However, I wish that a less Hollywood-type Director had crafted this movie. The acting was very good and I don't know how authentic DiCaprio's \\"Rhodesian\\" accent is, but it's a powerful film, and I do recommend it.     What ruined it for me were the typical shoot-'em-up and chase scenes, where your star can manage to run in an open street while people are getting cut down left and right, yet manage to dodge bullets on more than one occasion.     And it starts to get ridiculous how many moving, beautifully acted scenes happen while the characters are supposed to be running for their lives. We pause for these interludes, then, when the characters have finished their emotionally charged moments, the bad guys, out of respect for these actors' close-ups, I guess, start charging after them again, and the action blasts on.    A flawed, yet captivating story, that'll make you think twice about the real price of those beautiful diamonds.

0307266303|5.0|I have read this book soon after I started running.  All my life I hated running and this book explains why. It also made me try running barefoot which changed my running in a great way.  I recently visited in NY city in an exhibit by the history channel of Lucy. Lucy is a 3 million years old bones of the first humanoid that we evolved from it. In this exhibit they clearly mark the fact that the first humanoids walked for 2 million years before they started to use tools like stone and wood. Still the human brain required a lot of energy and proteins to grow - how did they get their protein? From hunting, how did they hunt? The answer is clear now after i have read this book - they used to run their pray to death.    Human beings or homo sapience were born to run for long distances. If your doctor tells you otherwise - find another doctor.
0061537969|3.0|At times this book was boring, in a sparse few other instances it was emotive and made me laugh out loud. Overall, I don't regret the hours spent reading this book, but I also wouldn't buy from this author again.

0890090572|5.0|I have always had a gravitation to the Sherlock Holmes stories, even more so because Data from Star Trek had a fascination with him too.  I really got into Sherlock when my older sister needed to get a special book for some class at a local university library.  While waiting around I decided to look him up.  Deep in the dark caverns of the library I pulled out one of his books... dusted it off and started reading \\"A Study in Scarlet\\"... I was hooked.  I wanted to know more about him.  I got this exact book when I was in high school.  Remember Crown Books?  My mom asked me if I wanted anything from there, I chose this book... it cost $20 back then!<br /><br />Here you can get it for $9!!!  If you calculate for inflation... say $30-$40?  This book is a steal!!  Out of all the books I wanted as a kid... this was it.  This is as close to seeing the original prints you can get.  The illustrations are fabulous and iconic. Almost as good as stepping through the holodeck!  :)<br /><br />Mind you this does not contain \\"A Study in Scarlet\\"  The story of how Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson met. It was written before he became popular through The Strand. That is an incredibly fascinating story that tv and film makers should explore someday, I have a feeling they touch upon it in the upcoming movie.  If you want a really comprehensive collection, this is not it, but is a treasure for the die-hard fan.

0380713802|5.0|Bill Bryson is an amazing story teller.  If you've ever thought of visiting Europe, in this book, he tells you how it was (when he visited it many years earlier) and how it has changed and if you might like to go there.  He has a great sense of humor and yet the book is filled with pathos as he relates to the people and the land.  Read this book and then find his other travel books on hiking the Appalachian trail - \\"A Walk in the Woods\\", Austrailia \\" A Sunburned Country\\", or living in England and then returning to the U.S.A. and finding himself \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself.\\"    Reader warning - some strong language does occur.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|Fantastic show and GREAT extras on the DVD! Always appreciate it when a DVD set includes extras. Includes deleted scenes, a gag reel, films about the tattoos, the motorcycle customization, casting decisions narrative including the original audition tapes for all the cast. Also includes some audio commentaries.<br /><br />All in all, a great DVD set and that's not to mention the show itself. Charlie Hunnam steals every scene he is in. He is electrifying, vibrant and SO talented. You can't take your eyes off watching him every moment he is on the screen.<br /><br />The show is fantastically written but even better is watching Hunnam interact, especially with his girlfriend--wow, their scenes are hot! Some actors are just really interesting to watch, they can do more with a look or a word than others do with entire lines. Hunnam is one of these.<br /><br />His character is the vice-president of the Sons of Anarchy but his intelligence, questioning of the status quo and determination to stick to his beliefs means he is in conflict with those in the club who either have no morals, easily leave them behind or only care about money.<br /><br />Hunnam is fascinating to watch, in one scene he is emotional or tender to his girlfriend or family, then the next he is violently asserting his will in clashes where he defends his principles or makes a point.<br /><br />There is an interesting tension showing his desire to be honest in the world, yet his need to be duplicitous, because of gun-running or other illegal activities.<br /><br />The scene where he finds a gawker sitting on his bike, and is pretending to be friendly then beats the guy to the ground, telling him \\"Don't EVER sit on another man's bike!\\" is an illustration of this.<br /><br />There is a stillness to Hunnam's portrayal which brings so much interest to the character. Instead of going on and on about something, he'll just say \\"Are you ready for this?\\" and with a short sentence and a look, will say everything.<br /><br />The audio commentaries are really funny too. There's one scene where they show Hunnam with his shirt off and the show's creator says \\"This is one for the ladies!\\" and he is so right.<br /><br />All in all, this DVD is well worth buying and keeping, not just a rental.one scene where they show Hunnam with his shirt off and the show's creator says \\"This is one for the ladies!\\" and he is so right.

0061537969|5.0|I highly recommend reading this book. It is from the perspective of quite a unique charactor; a dog named Enzo. Garth Stien's story is full of emotions and takes you on quite a journey. He has written in a way that makes you feel like your part of thier family. It has been awhile since I have read a book that I haven't been able to put down it. I highly recommend this for a great read!
B000NU2CY4|1.0|I'm no expert on Digital Noise Reduction (DNR) and Edge Enhancement (EE) and how it affects Blu-ray picture quality, but even I know something's seriously wrong when parts of the picture are *erased*. Compare the screenshots on the AVS Forum post:    bit.ly/EkTmM (Amazon seems to screen out external links in reviews, so just copy and paste this into the address bar)    Especially shocking to me (in terms of parts of the images being erased) are images 3 and 7. If you compare one of the broadcast HDTV versions with the Blu-ray version, you'll see that in image 3 (with the \\"Germania\\" caption) part of the spear on the left-hand side has been erased because the image-processing software thought that it should blend in with the tress in the background...    Even worse, in image 7, I can count at least 15 flaming arrows that have been removed from the Blu-ray version, presumably because the software thought that they were scratches or imperfections that had to be removed. Also, if you look on the right of the image, part of the fireball has been erased by a blue splodge. You can see what it looks like by downloading the video clips linked from the second post (you'll need a reasonably fast computer to play the 10-second 1080p clips and software such as VLC Media Player from videolan.org).    Gladiator is a fantastic movie and one of my favorites, but I would recommend sticking with the DVD until they release a version that doesn't have parts of the images erased.
032147404X|5.0|\\"The Digital Photography Book\\" I have found excellent, I have completed several digital photography courses, and have many books on the subject, this one is so different.  It is step by step, it covers those topics (although not in intense depth) that you spend hours on the net trying to find the answers for. (Usually after you have covered the topic elsewhere, but you can't remember the exact details or what course you learnt it in)eg \\"How do i set the camera up for panning\\" or \\"How do I frame this type of landscape\\".  The book is great size to carry with you, has these great little section at the back of the book with \\"Recipes\\" for getting most of the popular type of shots taken. All in all a brilliant little book that gets picked up far more than I thought it would.  And its great resource material for when I am planning to take certain type of shots.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This movie is the human condition.  Director's Cut is definately worth it; the original movie is missing some very good material.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|While I was hoping for a movie that resembled the mysterious and quiet atmosphere that was so popular in classic Resident Evil games such as RE2 and RE3 for the Playstation One console, I can understand taking the movies in a different direction (because let's be honest- when it concerns movies, the best idea is to take the series in an action-oriented direction because it's easier to keep people glued to their television sets when a film concentrates on lots of shooting, violence and action scenes).     Anyway, as far as pure adrenaline-pumping action is concerned, Resident Evil- Extinction is pretty good. Lots of blood squirting from zombies heads going in all directions as they were viciously killed, a plot that's relatively easy to follow because if you've played the games you more or less know what to expect, and characters that were MUCH better than the poor acting skills that many reviews of this (and other) RE films led me to believe.  Everyone says the acting is bad in these RE movies, but I have to disagree.    My favorite scene in the film involved lots and lots of infected crows! haha. That scene right there is really awesome. The segments that involved trying to find out how intelligent the zombies were was pretty good. Of course you already know what's going to happen when you try to tame an infected zombie as a way to find out how well they can communicate with normal people- death soon follows for the poor unfortunate people that happen to be near when the zombies suddenly flip out and lose control.     One thing this movie didn't do that lots of OTHER zombies frequently do is this-     When someone got bitten by a zombie, you know what happens- it's only a matter of time before they themselves turn into a zombie. Well that happens in this movie, but the other team members didn't seem concerned that one of their members just got bit by a zombie and acted like it wasn't a big deal.     If I remember, in other zombie films, once a zombie is able to bite through the skin of a normal person, they WILL become infected, and that person has to be killed immediately. The people that got infected in this movie weren't killed immediately for whatever reason. Perhaps a flaw with the storytelling, or perhaps the other team members already knew what to expect and how to control the zombie-morphing when it eventually happened, so everyone was well-prepared for it.  Still, when the one guy eventually turned into a zombie, it caught everyone by surprise, so I'm led to think it was a storyline mistake on the part of the writers.    Anyway, other parts of the film that I loved were the vicious blood-covered diseased dogs. They looked and acted VERY similar to the way they were in the older RE video games, and I appreciate that.     Overall, lots of shooting, lots of action, lots of hot babes playing main character roles, haha. I really liked this movie. Just please understand that turning the Resident Evil video game series into an action movie is the most effective way to win over the majority of the people, since most people out there prefer action films over survival horror (which requires a greater attention span to follow). It's just more satisfying watching some vicious looking creature get shot to death instead of watching the main characters crawl through quiet places with hardly no action to satisfy most peoples needs.   It build suspense sure, but that's not what most people want.

0316017922|5.0|i read this book and at the end of it i cried. the the questions started. why was i crying?    was it because i myself am an outlier? Coming from a small slum in Dominican republic where we were so poor that I had to carry my own chair to school on my head every morning for kindergarten, to the ghetto streets of the south Bronx to presently a successful entrepreneur living on the ocean side of Miami beach supporting my entire family back in DR and starting charities to help the children back home who don't stand a chance without what I had...a chance.     this book made me realize my life is far from a rags to riches story (not to mention Im not quite a gazillionaire yet) but my life is what it is largely by a string of lucky breaks (one was having the opportunity to come to this country), life circumstances and the people who had an impact in my development (good or bad).

0765350386|4.0|Most of my reading is usually much deeper stuff, but sometimes I like to read for fun and entertainment and this book fit that role perfectly.  I've already read \\"Warbreaker\\" and \\"Elantris\\" and thoroughly enjoyed them.  I've now started the \\"Mistborn\\" trilogy and this first book has me hooked.<br /><br />As with the other 2 novels that I've mentioned, Sanderson does a great job creating a fascinating world.  The concept of the mistborn is interesting and the way he explores those powers and the characters within this world makes for an absorbing read.<br /><br />The plot was not predictable, which kept my interest.  The characters were realistic enough to learn to like and empathize with.  I've learned a new appreciation for the fantasy genre and will probably explore it more in the future.<br /><br />I recommend this book and am excited to read the rest of the trilogy.
B0013A1T8I|2.0|This was a gorgeous movie, but if you've read the book, be prepared for a whirlwind tour of Pullman's epic fantasy. The film provided  so little exposition that if I hadn't read the book first, I would have been totally at a loss. To be fair, the books (including the first one, on which this movie was based) had some problems, too.  But at least there was enough time for Pullman to trick you into accepting most of his premises, even if they weren't completely backed up. In the movie these minor fault lines showed up as glaring inconsistencies--e.g., how can you tell a Daemon from a plain old animal?, when you hurt someone's Daemon, you hurt the person, but Mrs. Coulter whups her golden monkey upside the head and suffers no ill effects; why is Asriel in mortal danger from an organization that actually wants to use his knowledge in order to control the Universe?, what was the harm in separating children from their Daemons? (Billy seemed all right, if a little sad) etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />Fantasies, just like stories set in the here and now, must have internal logic. This one just left me shaking my head and wondering what on earth was going on. But, on the bright side, it was fun to watch, and the kids really enjoyed it.
0618154248|4.0|We gave this box set to our son for his second birthday.  He enjoys Curious George, and he enjoys these stories.  His favorite is the one about going fishing, which has lots of nice rhythm to it.  The rocket story seems very oddly assembled (maybe it's an awkward condensing of a longer story?), but that's an adult's perspective, not a 2-year-old's!

6300182193|1.0|instead, I got the same washed-out film as on the DVD.  I have no idea why John Badham thinks that bleeding the color out of this film was a good idea.  The rich colors added to the overall sensual and dangerous vibe that Langella projected so well.  Making this colorless--not the same as black and white--simply robbed the film of its vibrance.  I thought to avoid that by ordering a VHS, but this one must have been made from the film used for the DVD somehow--I am not a techy and have no idea how this was done, but the VHS film--to my deep disappointment--was bleached out and lifeless and I could just spit with frustration.  I really want to own this film in all its glorious color, but I have no idea how to do that.  The sleeve showed scenes in rich color, but the VHS did not deliver.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Although the first several chapters are a little slow, you become engrossed in the transformation of Leo and Raisa. The use of an actual serial killer as a foundation does not take away from the originality of the story.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I think one of the most tossed about objections to this film was that it's too long, that it drags out horribly and you're forced to endure to the end. What drew me to the film in the first place was the gorgeous cinematography I noticed in previews--the storyline looked interesting as well, but I was mainly attracted to the breathtaking landscapes and vivid colors. After my first viewing of the film I fell in love with it: the music is simple yet beautifully and creatively woven into the film; the acting I thought was superb; there are at least three storylines to follow through appropriate tension and resolution; and the cinematography was exactly what I'd hoped it would be after seeing the preview. Since first viewing it a few months ago I've watched Australia four times. If you're looking for a beautifully filmed movie with a great story, a convincingly developing female lead and gorgeous music, Australia is the movie for you.
1400049628|2.0|Max Brooks' ignorance of the M16 / AR-15 calls into question everything this man claims to know about zombies and the coming zombie break out. First, there are not \\"many experts\\" who consider the M16 to be the worst rifle in the world. Certainly there are those who believe the AK47 is better but that is not the same thing as saying the M16 is the worst. The Israeli Army uses the M16, that should tell you something right there. His stupidity starts with his claim about the M16A1's unreliability. It was the M16 that had issues in Vietnam! The M16A1 was the model that was introduced to correct the original rifle's shortcomings (ie chrome lined chamber, barrel, forward assist etc.) Shortcomings by the way, that were caused by the Army's fumbling with the weapon and it's ammunition, not the design. The M16 is not over complicated as Brooks claims. Want proof? Go to YouTube and watch both weapons being field stripped. I could have the bolt carrier out of an M16 and wiped down while the AK man was still messing with the spring! Let's talk reliability. In 1989 I fought in Panama as an infantryman, my unit still had the old M16A1. I had no jams with my rifle and never heard of any. I witnessed my squad leader fire seven full magazines through his, on full auto, no failures. My friends, with a little training, you can consistantly score hits to a zombie's head at 100 yards. Not so much with an AK, the AK's ruggedness comes with the price of looser tolerances that make it an imprecise weapon. We all know you have to hit a zombie in the head, do you want to stop the zombie at 100 yards or have to wait until it gets to 50 yards. The smell alone is reason enough to kill them at range. And don't believe \\" Liar Brooks\\" about having to adjust the sights everytime you shoot, he's full of it, that's why he lived long enough to write a zombie survival guide....zombies eat brains and he's got none! Buy the book I guess, but ignore this New Yorker's advice about weapons.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|I love this movie soooooo much.  When i was about 5 i would sneak and watch it on Disney late night in the living room.  No matter what a lot of people say, for the time it was made it is a very beautiful movie. I'm in the middle of actually reading it for the first time and am shocked at how close the movie comes to the book in some areas, but of course i haven't finished so i guess ill see.
0307266303|4.0|Granted, the author is a modern day writer for (and funded by) such magazines as Men's Health, etc., and thus, it is written in a way that will first and foremost SELL BOOKS; but overall this book is a very worthwile read. These days you just have to overlook hyperbole & propaganda because of the $$ driven publishing industry. He just wants you to read (or buy) his book, and I for one feel better off for having done so. There are alot of really interesting points to consider & ideas that I wouldn't have otherwise thought about. Just a fun & somewhat informative read. I'd recommend it to both runners and non-runners.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I honestly don't understand why people thought \\"Bad\\" was a failure. Some critics go as far as to say that MJ never made good pop music since the \\"Bad\\" album, and I have to disagree. \\"Thriller\\" was a massive success, possibly a success that will never ever be repeated again in history, and many people are blinded by this and fail to recognize the wonderful songs that he put had put out since then. This CD is full of great songs that MJ worked very hard on. He wanted to top \\"Thriller\\" with this album, and with big goals like that, you could just imagine all the hard work he put in to make this into a great album.        One of the great things about BAD is that unlike his past albums, Michael wrote nearly every song(\\"Just Good Friends\\" and \\"Man in the Mirror\\" were written by others), and most of them sound really great. And even though he didn't have an iconic hit like \\"Beat It\\" or \\"Billie Jean\\" with this album, it spawned 5 number one US hits which is something \\"Thriller\\" hadn't accomplished. Every material is pure MJ, and for me, some songs that went into singles and the filler materials are much better than \\"Thriller\\". He also started to develop a new style, a more harder sound, and his vocal sounds started to change a bit, ultimately developing into his unique vocal style .        I'll rate the songs from BAD:    1. Bad (4 stars): I do like this song, but as some have already mentioned, it aged badly. Some of the synthesizer sounds and the electric organ, no disrespect towards the great Jimmy Smith, just sounds too 80s to me. The short film for this track is very good, and I urge you to watch it as well. But I do not deny that this is a good song.    2. The Way You Make Me Feel (5 stars): Great song. One of the greatest MJ songs ever. Since this is such a popular song, no explanation is needed. Aged gracefully, too.    3. Speed Demon (3.5 stars): Some fans simply don't like this song. For me, it was just so-so. Not great, but no too bad. One of the songs thataged badly, but I do like some parts of the song.    4. Liberian Girl (5 stars): As Quincy Jones says in the interview tracks in this special edition CD, who could think of writing a song like this other than Michael? His creativity shines here. This is one of the most genius songs Michael has ever made. The arrangements and the lady speaking in the intro just adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the song. One of my favorites!    5. Just Good Friends (5 stars): Some fans don't like this song, but I think its great. It's not Michael's own creation, but the song is exciting and has a good beat to it. It makes me want to dance, just like \\"TWYMMF\\". The duet with Stevie Wonder is great. Michael's vocals are wonderful and their vocals work well together in this track. I originally didn't like this track much, but it grew on me with time.     6. Another Part of Me (5 stars): OK, I admit. I didn't like this song at first. The arrangement was cool and Michael's vocals in this song was really great, but it just didn't work for me. I especially didn't like the fact that it beat \\"Streetwalker\\" into the album, which is my favorite song. Then I watched him perform this live from Youtube, from the '88 BAD tour in Kansas City and I then fell in love with this song. It grew on me.    7. Man in the Mirror (5 stars): Best song in the album, for many people. The live performance at the Grammy awards is really something, and is worth checking out on Youtube. I agree with the opinion that the lyrics are a bit preachy, but it is nevertheless one of Michael's greatest songs. It is ultimately Michael's song, and in my opinion no one other than Michael and the songwriter Siedah Garrett can pull this song off. At Michael's memorial, it was only played as an instrumental with only an empty mike up on stage. Many fans probably cried when his daughter Paris shared her feelings at the end, but I felt really sad and empty when they played the instrumental of Man in the Mirror at the end. Beautifulsong.     8. I Just Can't Stop Loving You (5 stars): Such a beautiful song. The duet with Siedah Garrett was great. My personal favorite from this album along with \\"Dirty Diana\\". The live performances of this song is just wonderful. Be sure to check them out.    9. Dirty Diana (5 stars): No words needed. Everything about this song works on so many levels. Great rock song, and great guitar solo. Michael's vocals are the best in this track, in my opinion.    10. Smooth Criminal (5 stars): One of MJ's greatest creations. His own heartbeat can be heard in the intro. The Moonwalker version music video is very very good. And of course, the performance from the Bucharest DANGEROUS concert was really sick!!    11. Leave Me Alone (3.5 stars): I don't know. I guess it just doesn't work for me. I liked the music video, but this song, after all the listening still hasn't grown on me.    * Streetwalker (5 stars): Hands down, my favorite MJ song. Should have made it into the final album, but it would have sounded redundant with TWYMMF already in it. But I feel it would have been a big hit if it had been released as a single. Aged very well, and MJ sounds so excited singing this song. I guess he was happy with his work, and rightfully so. Very good song.    * Fly Away (5 stars): Beautiful. Another great song that couldn't get in. I heard that Michael wanted 30 songs in the BAD album. I wonder if all the unreleased materials sound as great as \\"Streetwalker\\" and \\"Fly Away\\". I really do hope they start putting out his unreleased songs, but not like the \\"Ultimate Collection\\". They should really put out one solid album dedicated to his unreleased songs, but I highly doubt they would do this.      The interviews with Quincy Jones are very informative as well. And of course, I would like to thank Amazon for delivering this CD in one piece with the jewel case not cracked all the way to South Korea.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|The BLU RAY version is a mess.  The flaming arrows disappear, the other details in the opening scene are destroyed due to improper use of noise reduction, the faces look as though waxed over, EXCEPT for SOME of the extended portions that were added to the theater version, which are okay and better than those portions in the original release shown in theaters.  Appearantly, this movie done without re-creating a master version from using actual ENTIRE film.  Cancel your pre-ORDER ASAP, and keep your regular DVDs as the upscaling standard DVD is MUCH better.    Gladiator in blu ray a rip-off, and those resposnible should be fired.  Maybe a class action lawsuit should be filed (however Braveheart is a good one in blu ray)
B00007BHOE|5.0|Great DVD. Seller, not so hot. Took almost 4 weeks for delivery. They didn't let me know they was a problem, until after i contacted them. I would say purchase the DVD, just from another seller, unless you can deal with a month delivery time.

B001FB4VZS|4.0|This is one of the best seasons for the series. Though honestly I can't believe that Clark still hasn't put on the cape and long johns yet.  After the events of season 8 would be disapointed if  he doesn't in season 9.    This season has it all. More Justice League team ups with Clark, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Aquaman and Martian Manhunter.  We have Maxima who been popular since her first appearance in DC Comics done well.  Return of Linda Lake from previous season episode Hydro who has same powers of a Spider-man villian.  Surprise appearances from Zatanna, Legion of Super heroes and Clark's most dangerous enemy Doomsday.  Jimmy Olsen has the type of romance and attempted marriage with Chloe that Jimmy had with Lois' sister in Jimmy Olsen comics of 1960s.  With Lex missing this season we introduction of his right hand woman from Superman The animated series, Mercy.  Jimmy Olsen starts Daily Planets  Superman photos even though he's only a red and blue non costume blur even though we get a glimpse of a Superman costume just not how I'd like it.
B001OQCV2Y|3.0|\\"Inglourious Basterds\\" wants to be World War Two on steroids. It wants to be bigger, stranger, bloodier, meaner, funnier, more stylish than WW II ever was. Here's the problem: World War Two WAS on steroids. It WAS bigger, stranger, bloodier, meaner, funnier, and more stylish than anything a sheltered film geek like Quentin Tarantino could dream up. Tarantino didn't have to invent a group of Jews who fight Nazis; there were such Jews, including the Warsaw Ghetto fighters, who staged the first urban uprising in occupied Europe, The Bielski Partisans, who fought in the forest, and the Treblinka and Sobibor Uprisings in death camps. Nothing Tarantino could invent could be stranger than the life of Oswald Rufeisen, a Jew who survived by posing as an SS man; his memoir, \\"In the Lion's Den,\\" is far freakier and gasp-inducing than anything in Tarantino's film. No filmmaker will ever make a more over-the-top or diabolically stylish production than Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 documentary of the Nuremburg Nazi Party Congress, \\"Triumph of the Will.\\"<br /><br />Tarantino has a reputation for stylish violence; the violent scenes in \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" are not as violent nor as innovative in their use of violence as those in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" or \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\" Tarantino also has a reputation for witty, stylish dialogue. Again, the real World War Two produced plenty of unforgettable lines: \\"Peace in our time,\\" \\"Who remembers the Armenians?\\" \\"I shall return,\\" \\"Nuts.\\"<br /><br />Tarantino's most daring ambition is to provide a more ignominious end for Hitler than Hitler's real demise. Sorry, can't be done. Hitler died a betrayed, solitary loser, knowing full well that everything he had strived for was lost. A far better movie, \\"Downfall,\\" depicts Hitler's nightmarish real life descent into Hell; Magda and Joseph Goebbels' historically accurate deaths in \\"Downfall,\\" preceded by their murder of their own children, are as creepy as it gets. Tarantino can't top history.<br /><br />\\"Inglourious Basterds\\" consists, for the most part, of a series of relatively disconnected dialogue scenes; the sensationally violent scenes are few and far between. Dialogue goes on and on and on. Yes, there are some gems, and some tension is created, but the simple fact is that Tarantino needs an editor. I never thought I'd be so bored in a lurid, violent movie about Jews wrecking revenge on Nazis. There are three different scenes of Nazis and resistance members who are hiding something sitting around tables, consuming food and drinks, and hoping that the Nazis don't discover their secrets. The first time Tarantino does this it is very powerful. The third time it just drags, and you think, \\"Come on. Don't you have anything else to say?\\"<br /><br />Suspension of disbelief and conventional narrative structure work magic on the brain, inviting identification. Tarantino does everything he can to push his viewers away from involvement in this film and to remind viewers that he, Quentin Tarantino, quirky film genius, is the real star. The Basterds of the title are minor characters; the plot hops from place to place, character to character. When top Nazis appear onscreen, a hand scrawled note appears on the film, with an arrow and the Nazi's name. Some scenes, like the opening involving a Nazi interrogation of a French peasant, are played as if real, and other scenes are obviously played with lots of winking and nudging at the audience. Musical styles shift throughout the movie. \\"This is really a salute to Spaghetti Westerns!\\" some of the music shrieks. Experimentation is welcome, but all this \\"Hey, don't forget, Quentin Tarantino is behind the camera; I'm famous for quirky films\\" winking and nudging broke my involvement with the film and made it a real slog for me. I didn't care about what I was looking at, and I got bored.<br /><br />\\"Inglourious Basterds\\"' opening scene is flawless. Nazis arrive at an isolated French farmhouse. A girl is hanging sheets on aline. Given Tarantino's penchant for saluting past films, I immediately thought of Andrzej Wajda's \\"Ashes and Diamonds,\\" and was ready to see a character bleed to death all over those clean sheets. Not so. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), a Nazi \\"Jew Hunter,\\" is there to interrogate the farmer (Denis Menochet). Menochet is brilliant in this scene, a study in stoic, peasant masculinity. Waltz waltzes into movie history. His fastidious, precious, melodramatic performance as a perfectly evil Nazi enters cinematic history. His life will never be the same.<br /><br />The rapturous embrace of \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" by critics and film fans is kind of depressing. It's sad to think that there are young people who will think that this is what World War Two either was like or should have been like, and it's sad to think that they are so divorced from history that they don't get how wrong both assumptions are. Years from now scholars will study kids who think that no Jews fought back till Tarantino invented them.or saluting past films, I immediately thought of Andrzej Wajda's \\"Ashes and Diamonds,\\" and was ready to see a character bleed to death all over those clean sheets.

B002IPXSTA|5.0|There are albums that you leave on repeat for weeks at a time. I remember my first experience with this kind of obsession. I'd sit in my room listen over and over, pouring over every lyric; noticing every syllable. That's not an experience I've had in quite a while, but Aim And Ignite has been the soundtrack to my life every day for weeks now.<br /><br />The complexities of the music don't overwhelm the catchy melodies, but compliment them. The lyrics are a grand description of the journey we're all going through: growing up, moving away, changing, parting with friends, and finally coming home. Not only are the words poignant, they're understandable.<br /><br />When The Beach Boys released [[ASIN:B00005ASHM Pet Sounds]], Paul McCartney bought a copy for every member of his family because he believed it could teach them more about life than anything else. I'm considering doing the same thing for this album.

B001SAO38Q|5.0|This film was so much fun; I didn't know if I should sit down or stand up. Caines' character is part Bond, Flint and Sellers, to be. It's a heist and it's very complicated with many interesting characters including Benny Hill as a computer nerd!  Very 60s and very good; while enjoying widescreen vistas with car chases, babes and things never tried again. The BD has mono and 5.1 DDTHD and 'Rocks' at moments while providing the 'Best Blu-Ray Picture' for a film; old or new. Or close.
0756405890|3.0|The best I can say of this book is that I liked it despite my better judgment. Any book that can keep me on the couch for 8 hours at a time and well past my bedtime has something to it. Rothfuss has a talent for storytelling, and despite what many reviewers have mentioned about the lack of action (its true, not much actually happens), he manages to make the journey the interesting part. I didn't mind that the plot seemed to wander at times.    However, I can't give this book five stars because, although I was definitely engaged, I was also equally frustrated. Kvothe has potential to be a very interesting character, but the fact that he is all-knowing and instantly excels at everything he does (at 15!) is a little ridiculous. I remember one scene where he is sitting in a bar with a much older man, having a drink and talking sagely about life, and then I remembered that he is supposed to be 15 years old, and the dialogue became almost laughably impossible. He is arrogant, but rather than Rothfuss using this as a way to help show character development over time, Kvothe remains arrogant and seems never to suffer the consequences of it  (oh sure, he gets punished a few times, but he always gets what he wants too). Too many of the scenes in this book are simply unbelievable. Its hard to feel any thrill or anxiety when you know that the protagonist is smart and capable enough for anything he comes across.    I also found myself really disappointed that the other characters remained so one-dimensional. By the end of 700 pages, I still couldn't keep straight who Kvothe's friends and teachers were, because most of them had nothing exceptional or memorable about them (the exceptions being Elodin, Denna and the Underthing-girl). The villains were pretty flat as well - the best writers know how to make a villain seem human and somewhat sympathetic, even when you're rooting for the hero. There wasn't much about Ambrose, Hemme, or the Chandrian that made for emotional tension.Finally, even though I read this book in a few sittings, I found myself shaking my head at the end when there was no conclusion to any of the storylines. After 700 pages, it should at least be a little clear where things are going. Some storylines in this book (spiders, draccus, Skarpi) seem integral to the story at first, only to be forgotten and never mentioned again. Maybe Rothfuss is just taking his sweet time to come full circle, but it doesn't look that way.     So, to sum it up, I enjoyed this book, but I'm not sure why. Rothfuss seems to be a promising writer, and I think he could do great things with a little discipline and a good editor. Take it or leave it...
0670867616|5.0|This book is absolutely essential to anyone  who loves Thai food, eats Thai food, wants to know about Thai food, has been to Thailand, wants to go to Thailand...etc! :) Written and compiled by David Thompson (an Australian National Treasure as far as I am concerned) the history of Thai food and ingredients is lovingly described. This guys loves his stuff, respects authenticity and at the same time the innovative nature of the Thai people and great cooks everywhere. Even if you never cook a single one of the (mouthwatering, delicious, fantastic and wonderful) recipes, you will enjoy this book just for its stories. You can't go wrong whether it is for yourself or as a gift. Buy it!!

1416955070|3.0|Mortals...they always get in the way. Clary is just your typical teenage girl. She goes to school, hangs out with her adoring best friend Simon, and argues with her mother. That is until she is witness to something she should have never seen. Clary meets Jace, Isabelle, and Alec while they are on a mission to kill a demon. That's right, a demon; in a night club.    Clary suddenly finds herself in an unfamiliar world when her mother mysteriously disappears and a demon attacks her in her own home. Lucky for her Jace had taken an interest in her and helped to save her life. Now she is discovering a whole new world that her mother had kept secret from her. Clary is a Shadowhunter, just like Jace, Isabelle, and Alec. She is a member of an elite demon-killing race from another world. They are part-demon (the good kind) and exist in a world where fairies, vampires, warlocks, werewolves, and other \\"fairy tale creatures\\" are real.    She quickly learns that her mother has hidden quite a lot from Clary over the years. Her mother knew the location of one of the 3 magical items that can be used to create more Shadowhunters, and this knowledge is what lead to her capture. As Clary tries to come to grips with her new reality, she is also trying to save her mother from wherever she has been taken, keep her very human friend away from the very non-human things that are trying to kill her, and try not to fall for Jace.    This is just the first book in a 4 book trilogy (go figure) that has a very Buffy feel to it. A young girl finds out that she is a centuries-old prophetic protector sworn to destroy all things that go bump in the night and try to kill humans. While there are some truly funny moments (I mean who doesn't love a teenage boy who makes references to Dungeons & Dragons?) and the over-all story line is quite intriguing, the book lacks a change of pace from many other books like it. A great read if you are looking for a series filled with all manner of fantastical creatures.

B001U0HBPG|1.0|Brad Pitt delivers an uninteresting performance in a one-joke script that has nothing to say.<br /><br />If I were to point out that if Benjamin Button were really aging backwards, he would soon become a world-renowned scientific curiosity, you might say, \\"Oh, come on!  Kindly suspend your disbelief so that the script may arrive at its insights.\\"<br /><br />But what insights would those be?  Nobody has anything in common with Benjamin's problems, and mediating on his reveals no deep or abiding truths about life, death, or the human condition.  It's almost like the filmmakers were so infatuated with the premise that they built a movie around that alone.  But nothing much seems to happen in the movie, and the filmmakers seem uncertain what they'd like to say in the first place.
B002EWD08Q|4.0|While \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\" explored the predominant sound set forth on \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\", the darker and more brooding \\"Humbug\\" establishes the Arctic Monkeys as those willing and able to explore and expand their art in a worthwhile way.     Queens of the Stone Age frontman, and contributing producer, Josh Homme's influence is unmistakable. Echoes of Mark Lanegan voiced Queens tracks are easily discerned. Though not exclusively, for fans of QOTSA and Arctic Monkeys, it's a very enjoyable turn.    The set isn't immediately accessible, but as previous reviewers have indicated, it will strongly engage you upon repeated listens. There is good depth and maturity to the new material.    For fans and initiates alike, a very good, seemingly long-to-peak, collection of songs.
0618918248|3.0|Mr. Dawkins writes in a style that's easily accessible and entertaining. As mean-spirited as some of his comments may seem, the wit behind much of his writing is undeniable. His descriptions of evolutionary theory and even the probability of God's existence are wonderfully detailed. Dawkins takes care to say that the empirical evidence seems to point to God's non-existence as we understand God, instead of giving some sort of \\"proof\\" or other untenable position.   My lower rating is reflecting upon several points. First, there's a lack of any information of what good has been done in religion's name. To denounce religion as categorically evil and not even mention any good from it is not fair to the \\"evidence\\" out there. Finally, although Dawkin's use of science in his own field is rigorously researched, his use of other disciplines are much weaker. For example (and I really don't know why more researchers haven't denounced the field), evolutionary psychology, which doesn't have any living test subjects, is frequently used as the answer to religion's origins. I fail to see how this is science and not conjecture.   Having said that, this book will make any believer want to seek out the good that is out there in their own faith, and hopefully make a strong stand against both the unethical actions of religion as well as the hindering of empicially verified scientific ideas.
B00275EGWO|5.0|The Hurt Locker (Kathryn Bigelow, 2009)<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow has been one of my favorite directors for over twenty years now, ever since I first saw Near Dark, which is on my list of the hundred best movies ever made. 1995's Strange Days confirmed that diagnosis, and I'll even admit to her two intervening films, Point Break and Blue Steel, being guilty pleasures. But I am in the minority; Bigelow has never really gotten the attention she deserves from professional critics, in my estimation. Actually, strike that--Kathryn Bigelow's time has come. The Hurt Locker is a movie that has \\"Oscar nominations\\" written all over it. It is gripping, brilliant, and the best war movie since...well, I've been thinking about that in the days since I saw it, and I'm probably overlooking one or two, but the name that keeps coming to mind when I try to finish that sentence is The Longest Day. (Which, if you don't recall, was made in 1962.)<br /><br />Warning: the summary paragraph contains a minor (I believe) spoiler that's kind of unavoidable. If you're planning on seeing the film and haven't, skip it.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker tells the story of an Iraqi bomb disposal unit led by the methodical Matt Thompson (Memento's Guy Pearce). Until, that is, he's killed in the film's opening scene. The army replaces him with William James (28 Weeks Later...'s Jeremy Renner), who is everything Thompson was not, most notably an adrenalin junkie. (Think Vin Diesel in XXX, but with not as good a voice and not nearly the number of toys.) The bulk of the film is a slice-of-life kind of thing about James and his subordinates-cum-partners, Sanborn (Notorious' Anthony Mackie) and Eldredge (An American Crime's Brian Geraghty). I can't remember about what profession it was said that it involves endless stretches of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror, but being in a bomb-disposal unit in a war zone? I can't imagine a better definition than that.<br /><br />And that's what makes The Hurt Locker such a brilliant film; anyone can film a tense scene of someone defusing a bomb and make it tense. Bigelow manages, through James' personality, to make the endless-stretches-of-boredom scenes even more tense than the bomb-disposal scenes. (There's a great example of this about halfway through the movie, when James is defusing a particularly complex car bomb, while Sanborn and Eldredge are keeping watch. The two scenes surrounding it are fraught with tension, while we never have any doubt that James is going to come through the defusing without a scratch. Why? Because he is convinced. And we believe him.) We get a subplot about James making friends with a local kid, a soccer-playing DVD-bootleg-selling roustabout who calls himself Beckham (Christopher Sayegh), and as that unfolds, it's one of the tensest parts of the film. Part of the reason for this is that this isn't really a film about bomb disposal, about war, or about Iraq in general as much as it is a character study of William James--how Iraq changes him, how he changes those around him, and perhaps most importantly, how he changes Iraq. And I'll try to say this in such a way as not to make it a spoiler, but you want impressive? Bigelow does in ten minutes what took Michael Cimino an hour in the third act of The Deer Hunter. And does it, arguably, better.<br /><br />But all this is secondary, at least while you're sitting in the theater, to the simple fact that while you are watching this movie, you are there, in the heat and the sand. Bigelow shot more than two hundred hours of footage for a hundred-twenty-five-minute film. Obsessive perfectionism? Perhaps, but the success of the result is evident.<br /><br />I have been lucky enough to see two of the first truly great films of the new millennium this week. One was Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Tokyo Sonata (below). The other is The Hurt Locker. Do what you must to see this, preferably on the big screen. It is a war film, true, but it is so, so much more than that. I have only touched the tip of the iceberg here (I realized just now I forgot to mention a cameo from one of my all-time favorite actors, David Morse); I could go on talking about things that make this movie great all day. If there is a failing in the film, it is in that last ten minutes I mentioned above; doing it better than Cimino still means you're ripping off Cimino, kinda. This is one of those very few times when the ending that was absolutely, positively right--the only ending the film could have had that would keep it true to itself--still felt like it could have been better had Bigelow managed to come up with the ending that was just slightly wrong, but a whole lot more original. Still, that is the most minor of minor quibbles, and let's face it, it's a great ending nonetheless. See it. You won't regret it. **** ½re (I realized just now I forgot to mention a cameo from one of my all-time favorite actors, David Morse); I could go on talking about things that make this movie great all day.

140120841X|4.0|For those of you who have viewed the film and are thinking of reading the novel now, I was in your shoes.  The first two books in this novel/series read very similar to the film.  The third book is a conclusion that the film did not delve into.  This book is tremendously intelligent and artistic, but its not the same walk in the park that the movie adaptation was.  You will have to pay much attention to each character's story, as they all play significant roles in the end.<br /><br />I agree with the overall praise for this novel, but I have to be honest and say that The Killing Joke and Watchmen impressed me far more than V.  The reason would be that I totally lost track of each character in the third act.  In the movie the characters were so defined and easily readable.  In the book a lot of the characters look the same and initially appear very trivial.  But their importance was unknown until much later in the book.  My confusion, which could be remedied in a re-read, prevented me for enjoying this book as I did Moore's other work.<br /><br />Aside from my troubles reading the third act, I did not leave V for Vendetta without reward.  The intelligent plot-weaving and dialogue concocting was very top-notch and very Alan Moore.  Moore always seems to be a disciplined writer, because it shows through his meticulous work.  V for Vendetta is definately a comic with educational reward.  It's very smart and it should make you smarter.<br /><br />I'm sure that I'd be criticized for saying I enjoyed the film more.  I'll say instead that the film and the book are two entirely different journeys.  Yes, I took the non-comic-book-fan approach and watched the film first.  I may have different opinions based on where I came from before I entered this particular piece, but I do believe I can be help to those who were in my shoes.  If you saw the movie first, be prepared for a different ride.  You may, as the majority does, enjoy the book much more than the film.  You may also be like me; enjoy the movie experience more than the book.  However, I am sure you will enjoy both to some degree and you will definately get your money's worth by collecting both.  Alan Moore is yet to get a refund out of me, in fact far from it.e experience more than the book.

B00000F169|4.0|Dark Star (John Carpenter, 1974)<br /><br />By the time I first saw Dark Star, a decade after its release, I was already a firm John Carpenter fan. And, not surprisingly, I loved it. Years passed, and I wondered if my love for it had more to do with John Carpenter than the movie itself, so I went back and watched it again recently. No, it wasn't nostalgia or a blind adherence to John Carpenter (which I, like most folks, lost right after They Live, his last great film), it's just that Dark Star is a wonderful film that, like many great things, manages to both parodize and celebrate at the same time.<br /><br />The story concerns a bunch of guys in a spaceship far, far away from Earth. Their mission seems to be to go around blowing up unstable planets, for which they have a large supply of semi-intelligent bombs. They've been wandering the universe for twenty years with everything going along about as usual. But, of course, once the cameras start rolling, everything goes belly-up. The ship's mascot goes crazy, the wiring starts breaking down, mental instabilities in a few crewmembers come to a head. It's all played for laughs, and Carpenter turned the film's shoestring budget into a strength rather than a weakness by finding the most improbable things he could and utilizing them (the mascot, for example, is a spray-painted beach ball with attached claws).<br /><br />Needless to say, any seventies deep-space epic was bound to be compared to 2001, and Carpenter subverted the paradigm by making this, however loosely, a parody of that movie; in this case, rather than the intelligent machine deciding its human handlers were useless, the machine's intelligence comes mostly from programming, and it's up to the crew to bring it, as it were, to a HAL level of intellect. (The shortcomings of this approach should be obvious. They are also quite funny.) Not an easy thing to do when your crew are dysfunctional lunatics. The thing is, it all fails so miserably that in many ways it works. Whether Carpenter and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon (who also acts in the film) are diverting your attention cleverly from plot holes or whether the movie is smacking you in the face with them, they don't seem to matter a great deal here; it's a movie that was obviously made for the sake of making others laugh, and it succeeds. While not nearly on the par of Carpenter's greatest films, it is nevertheless an inspiring film for aspiring filmmakers wondering what they can do with no budget but a great deal of inspiration (and Dark Star should be a thousand times more inspiring than most indie genre flicks that have been released since), and an amusing one for the rest of us. Very well worth your time. ****r and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon (who also acts in the film) are diverting your attention cleverly from plot holes or whether the movie is smacking you in the face with them, they don't seem to matter a great deal here; it's a movie that was obviously made for the sake of making others laugh, and it succeeds.

B0000AZAUM|5.0|As a huge fan of the SACD format, I've been trying to pick up as many SACD's that I thought MIGHT appeal to me.  I knew all the Bowie hits that most people know - including the 2 on this album (ZS, Suffragette City), and given the amazing price on this album ($14.00), I figured what the hell, I'd expand my limited Bowie song knowledge and pick up this disc.      My music system is a simply one: NADC326BBB Integrated amp, Pioneer DV-47Ai SACD/DVD-A/CD player, a pair of B&W 685 speakers, and a B&W ASW650 sub.  Unlike some SACD's that cover rock material from the 60's/70's, every song on this album sounds like it was restored from an excellent master.  Some Rolling Stones SACD's have \\"weak spots\\" where I'm convinced no further fidelity (that my ears could pick up) was achieved transitioning to the SACD format. This album was front to back an excellent listen on my first dip.  Like I said, I only knew 2 of the 11 tracks but as a fan of good, original music, I have to say that every single track struck me as a \\"good song\\".  Add to that how vibrant and new the music quality sounded - and it was hard for me to believe that this album is as old as it is.  I'm very impressed and would recommend this to anyone thinking about getting more into SACD and/or Bowie.
B000FGGE68|1.0|Ultraviolet (Kurt Wimmer, 2006)<br /><br />I had somehow gotten it into my head that Ultraviolet was a stupid American remake of a brilliant British TV miniseries of the same name. After all, they both deal with a war between vampires and humans. The reality of the situation, however, is that had the filmmakers here tried to do a stupid American remake of a brilliant British TV miniseries, the end result, no matter how bad, would have been far better than this plotless mess. As far as I can tell, the script for this was cribbed together by someone who'd watched at least a thousand action movies and thought \\"wouldn't it be cool to take all the best scenes from all these and put them together in one flick?\\".  To be fair, they did a pretty good job of that. There are a lot of well-done action scenes to be found here. The problem is that the \\"story\\" holding them together is tissue-thin, with characters for whom \\"cardboard\\" would be a higher-rent district. And for some reason it bugs the hell out of me that Wimmer, along with all the other movies he's stolen scenes from here, also cannibalized his own work (more than one scene was lifted straight from Equilibrium). The only thing to recommend this is one brief, badly-lit shot of Milla Jovovich's rear end. I'm sure I've seen worse movies this month, but offhand I can't think of one. (half)

B001UV4XL0|3.0|A Perfect Getaway (David Twohy, 2009)<br /><br />I've seen a good number of David Twohy's movies at this point, both those he's directed and those for which he's just been a screenwriter, and they all seem to be missing something, even those I've come to love over the years (for example, the nonexistent character development in Pitch Black). Of course, there's more than one thing wrong with some of them (can we say Waterworld?), but in general, they're pretty decent movies with some sort of standout problem that keeps them from being the best movies they can be. While it's not a technical fault in this case--and that tells me that Twohy has finally come close to really putting it all together--A Perfect Getaway has one major failing, and it blew the movie for me.<br /><br />Plot: Cliff (Sunshine Cleaning's Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich, recently of the Resident Evil movies) are a newlywed couple honeymooning in Hawaii. Another newlywed couple have just been murdered in Honolulu, and the police, according to a couple of hikers they meet, are looking for a man and a woman. Which isn't a problem, except that they keep running into Nick (Dreamcatcher's Timothy Olyphant) and Gina (Insanitarium's Kiele Sanchez), a trailer-trash couple who happen to be hiking the same otherwise-deserted trail with them.<br /><br />The big failing, of course, is that most of the people I've talked to figured out the Big Reveal either from watching the trailers or from reading a review that lets you know something really, really important that I'm trying my best to avoid. And for those who didn't quite figure it out from one of those, there's one scene less than halfway into the movie (which was shown during a special about the movie on the Current TV network, whoops) that gives the game away pretty clearly. And it seems to me that when you're writing a suspense film, it's not really a good idea to let your audience know the ending before, you know, you get to the ending. But then, I can kind of understand what Twohy was trying to do, and I have to give him respect for trying it (basically, it's a riff on Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso, and no one tries it because it's basically impossible to pull of unless you're Dario Argento). Other than that, it was a pretty intelligent thriller (though I admit I had to think about one of the scenes for a while before I realized there wasn't a plot hole big enough to drive a truck through in it), competently directed, with some surprisingly decent acting (especially from Jovovich, who's never really shown much in the way of acting ability) and gorgeous photography. All of it, however, comes entirely unglued during the Big Reveal. Perhaps it's a good thing so many of us figured it out so long beforehand, because if I didn't know what was going to happen already, I'd have been really, really confused by the fragmented, incomplete way in which the Big Reveal is revealed. (Big-ly.)<br /><br />One of these days David Twohy is going to get it right. This is not that day, but it's reasonably close, as long as you don't mind it when you figure out the ending of a movie before you actually get there. ***d what Twohy was trying to do, and I have to give him respect for trying it (basically, it's a riff on Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso, and no one tries it because it's basically impossible to pull of unless you're Dario Argento).

(If you've been reading along with the series, you'll know how well this idea turns out.) We go through the second half of the school year, with brand-new silly ideas from pretty much every member of the cast, plus, believe it or not, a romantic subplot. (Greg Heffley with a girlfriend? Say it ain't so! Well, okay, it ain't so, but...) Sharp and funny, as the rest of the series so far, and from my perspective, just as funny for those who only have dim memories of childhood as it is for the kids it's so wildly popular with. *** ½

B00005JKGZ|3.0|Meet Me in St. Louis (Vicente Minnelli, 1944)<br /><br />I spent a good block of time in 2007 and 2008 compiling thousand-best lists found in books and on the Internet, either compilations (found in places like the They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? website) or lists compiled by fans, critics, and the like, usually in book form (e.g. Jonathan Rosenbaum's thousand must-see films list, easily findable on the net, or the New York Times guide to the thousand best films, a book). I did a bunch of data mining with the compilation when I got done; ten lists gave me about thirty-eight hundred different movies, a great deal less than I expected. There's a lot of crossover. But that crossover is usually limited to two or three lists; when you start looking at films that appear on five or more lists, you get down to a very small selection of films. No single movie appears on all ten lists, which actually surprises me (for some reason, I had jotted down that there were two). Twenty-eight movies appear on nine of the ten lists; for trivia purposes, the odd man out in almost every case is the quirky, fun Halliwell list. But the twenty-eight in that nine-of-ten sublist are the cream of the crop. You've heard most of their names bandied about pretty much everywhere; The Maltese Falcon, Psycho, Last Tango in Paris, Rebel Without a Cause, that sort of thing. To my mind, there are only two outright surprises on the list (though I admit I paused for a moment at Hitchcock's Rebecca). One of them is Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark. The other is Meet Me in St. Louis. One doesn't normally think of period musicals as being among the best films of all time, at least not those not written by Ridgers and Hammerstein. And yet there it is. It's currently ranked as the 220th greatest movie ever made at They Shoot Pictures (down from 201st  this month; TSPDT is a dynamic list that compiles surveys from almost two thousand critics), and everyone from Halliwell to Rosenbaum, and almost everyone in between, considers it a must-see.<br /><br />Meet Me in St. Louis, set in the title city (mostly) during the winter before the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, is the story of a family: mom and dad, a son, four daughters, and a plucky housekeeper. Much of the picture centers on youngest daughter Tootie (adorable child star Margaret O'Brien, who's still going strong; as I write this, work is wrapping on her latest film, Frankenstein Rising), the real draw of the picture is Esther, the second-oldest daughter, played by Judy Garland. In any case, this is a character-driven picture for the most, part, so a plot synopsis is going to give much of the game away if I go anywhere substantive; it all starts off with Esther pining for the boy next door and oldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer) eagerly awaiting a call from New York City, during which she expects to be proposed to. Things all go haywire from there; misunderstandings, travails, and musical numbers abound as we head for the Christmas season.<br /><br />I remain unconvinced that anyone remembers the film for anything other than two things that are, at best, incidental to it; it is the film in which the song \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" made its debut (with somewhat different lyrics than we have today), and it's the film where Vicente Minnelli met his future wife, Judy Garland. When it comes right down to the film, it's really something of a plotless mess, though quite a gaudy and fine-looking one. Judy Garland could cover Tom Waits and make it sound torchy, so when you've got songs that were written to her strengths, they're pretty much guaranteed winners, and Margaret O'Brien shows why she was the main successor to Shirley Temple in the realm of ultra-cute perky kids. The movie is marred, however, by the incredible stupidity of a number of its characters, most of all Esther, who makes bad decision after bad decision in order to advance various plot points. It could be argued, of course, that this is a musical, and realism pretty much flies out the window when it comes to musicals. True, but that doesn't mean you can't have realistic characters making realistic choices when they're not breaking into spontaneous, highly-choreographed dance numbers. (Singin' in the Rain, anyone?)<br /><br />Dumb fun. I don't regret watching it, but it's not something I'll do again in the near future. ** ½m pretty much flies out the window when it comes to musicals.

B001QTXM5Y|4.0|Watchmen (Zack Snyder, 2009)<br /><br />Dear Zack,<br /><br />May I still call you Zack, even after all those nasty things I said in my review of 300? I hope so, because I'm going to start out my review of Watchmen by taking them all back. I really don't hope you get eaten by wild dingoes in the middle of the night, and I have no intentions of making you into a delectable stew. Okay, 300 was still a monstrous desecration of its source material, but Watchmen is, for most of its length, as slavishly faithful as 300 was a departure. For a movie that's been in on-and-off development for almost twenty years, that was necessary, and adding in those shots that were made to look as much like the panels they were drawn from as possible was a wonderful touch. But more on this later.<br /><br />For those of you who have been in a cave for twenty years, Watchmen takes place in an alternate-universe 1985 in which superheroes exist. Well, one superhero exists, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup). The rest of the Watchmen are just regular guys who dress up and fight crime with good old-fashioned brawn and technology. At least, that is, until the Keene Act, passed a few years previous, which outlawed masked vigilantes. Dr. Manhattan was appropriated by the government, of course, for as a military asset, he's incomparable--a nuclear scientist who, through a nasty accident, has become something much more than human. With him went Silk Spectre, now known as plain ol' Sally Jupiter (27 Dresses' Malin Akerman), Doc's girlfriend. The Comedian (The Accidental Husband's Jeffrey Dean Morgan) went into retirement, as did Nite Owl (Hard Candy's Patrick Wilson), who spends his weekends drinking beers with the original Nite Owl, Hollis Mason (Stephen McHattie, recently of Pontypool), the only former masked crusader to have gone public with his identity save Adrian Veidt (Brideshead Revisited's Matthew Goode), now a captain of industry). There was one other member of the Watchmen, Rorshach (Shutter Island's Jackie Earle Hailey). Rorschach ignored the ban, and still wanders at night in his mask and gloves, fighting street crime and doing voice-overs. (Rorschach is an obvious nod to Travis Bickle, but without the cab.) Now that all the players are set up, the movie opens with someone breaking into the Comedian's apartment and killing him, and Rorschach's appearance on the scene soon after. Combined with a few other events and portents, Rorschach comes to the conclusion that someone is stalking former masked vigilantes. His former colleagues initially dismiss the idea, but a few of them come around, Meanwhile, all is not well on the home front with Laurie and Dr. Manhattan; Doc's working with Veidt on an energy source that will revolutionize life as we know it (and neutralize the Soviet threat in the process), and Laurie's feeling lonely. Meanwhile, Manhattan (whose voice bears a startling resemblance to Hal's from 2001) has the charge leveled at him that his very presence may be giving those around him cancer, leading to him rethinking his remaining on Earth. It's all part of something bigger, of course, but in order to get to the bottom of it, the former friends will have to reforge old bonds, and sever even older ones, in their respective quests for truth.<br /><br />Simply put, Watchmen is one of the most dazzling visual spectacles I've ever seen, and it is so perfectly paced that it is also the fastest three hours I've ever spent watching a movie. (This is the directors' cut, natch.) I wasn't sure how much I expected from this cast, but that may have more to do with the fact that like most Watchmen fans I've been casting and recasting this thing in my head for decades. All of them do an outstanding job. Snyder's direction is the best I've seen from him, and as I said, for the most part, the adaptation is slavishly faithful to the original comic. (The bits from Hollis Mason's book are absent, as is Takes from the Black Freighter; both appeared on DVD as this hittheaters in animated form.) Of course, the big change, which involves the climax, has been the source of controversy since about ten seconds after the movie was released in theaters. Put me down with those who felt it intelligent, well-thought-out, and, if not better than the comic book's climax, as good. Simply put, I expected Watchmen to be watchable but throwaway; what I actually got surpassed my expectations in every possible way. One of the best movies I've seen in 2009. **** ½course, the big change, which involves the climax, has been the source of controversy since about ten seconds after the movie was released in theaters.

B00005JKG9|5.0|Perhaps that's wishful thinking, as I never got the chance to see GGR on stage. But watching it here makes you realize it could be very satisfying in a small theater. After all, there are relatively few sets (most indoors) and essentially no special effects. Isn't it nice to watch a great movie without CGI? That's how all the movies were in my day, sonny!<br /><br />As for the product itself (10 Year Anniversary Special Edition from 2002), I'm not sure why a studio would release a two-disc set with one disc being widescreen and the other being full screen, but at least it's not a flipper disc! In any case, there's plenty of extras, including some Director's commentary (I believe scene specific, not running the length of the film).<br /><br />Certainly we see echos of Death of a Salesman, especially in Jack Lemmon's character. Overall a magnificant ensemble case. I have heard that the actors would come to the set even when they didn't have a scene, just to watch the other guys work.<br /><br />PUT THAT COFFEE DOWN!

B0015ABRE2|5.0|I am a pretty big TV fan. I'm into a variety of shows including: 24, Lost, Friday Night Lights, FX shows (Rescue Me, Nip/Tuck, Sons of Anarchy), the Office, 30 Rock, Weeds, and the Mentalist. So, this review comes from a TV fan, not just a Dexter or Showtime fan.    I LOVE Dexter. All three seasons kept me interested and on the edge of my seat. I've just finished up season three and I am, again, thrilled with what the writers/actors are able to do with the show. Michael C. Hall deserves every award he's nominated for. I really believe that he is the perfect choice for this role. He has a great playfully sinister look (just check out the cover for the season 2 DVD set) and an awesome delivery of cheesy lines. Jennifer Carpenter and Julie Benz are perfect, and each year there has been an amazing addition to the cast. Season three brought a near-perfect performance from Jimmy Smits.    Season three took Dexter even deeper into emotional exploration. He found himself loving differently, valuing people over processes (at times), caring enough to guide friends the right way (e.g. Angel after his girlfriend was beaten), and actually showing some interest in fatherhood (e.g. when the creepy guy was photographing Aster). It's always nice to see a show NOT fall into a routine with new characters, but the same challenges (e.g. Heroes).    Dexter Season 3 is a MUST for fans of the first two seasons. If you haven't seen them, watch them all in order (because you really can't miss season 1!) WATCH THIS SHOW AND LOVE IT!

0061122416|4.0|Some novels are as much mirrors as books.  That is, readers either see a true image of themselves or decide it's a fun-house mirror trick.  THE ALCHEMIST is such a book.  At a surface level, it's a simple quest book wherein a humble shepherd boy travels from Andulasia to Egypt in search of a treasure.  But it's also a spiritual book, one intended to \\"teach\\" a lesson to the reader about love, passion, determination, people, and the world.<br /><br />So, if you are basically an upbeat type, an optimist who looks for the best in others, a person constantly in search of spiritually uplifting fare and meaning, your reflections will be positive and you will be among the hundreds of 5 and 4-star reviewers.  If, on the other hand, you smell \\"Dr. Phil\\" in all of this, give the self-help section of bookstores a wide berth, and consider any modern fable or allegory fraudulent, your reflections will be negative and you will be among the hundreds of 3-star (or lower) reviewers.<br /><br />It is not for me to judge, as I can see both viewpoints -- that of people who find this a positive way to live life and that of people who consider this so much Jonathan Livinston claptrap.  Live and let live, I say.  I enjoyed the narrative and found the spiritual words of wisdom acceptable.  But then, I'm way past the \\"angry young man\\" phase of my life, meaning I find a little magic more than acceptable the deeper I travel into life.<br /><br />And you...?
B000W4D94I|5.0|If anyone has this movie in Blu-ray please let us know if it has DTS Sound or Dolby Sound?  I bought a second copy of this movie on DVD in 2001 because it was in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound and it blew me away.  Yet, Warner Brothers may have re-release this on Blu-ray in Dolby Digital 7.1 or 5.1 Surround Sound.  Please let us know if this is true.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|This album is great. I am a recent fan of KOL. I honestly only bought this CD so that I could keep \\"Sex on Fire\\" on repeat but I instantly fell in love with all the other songs on this album. I give it an A+!
1601251505|5.0|Pathfinder is great. It improves a great deal on a lot of shortcomings in D&D 3.5 and does so without overhauling the system. This is what Wizards should have done with 4th edition (instead of making it a video game in paper form). My group had been using many house rules that ended up being revisions in this game. Its more intuitive, its streamlined, it finally makes sense in most ways. The classes and rules are better balanced. My group will be playing this system for some time to come. Thank goodness because we'll never play 4th edition (the latest Wizards money-grab). Although third edition Earthdawn looks tasty.
B001OQCV9W|5.0|Phenomenal movie and well done; I think Meryl is tiny bit too polished to play Julia, but she was in keeping with the general spirit of her in the role.  Here was an older woman who found success in life at a later age...the book was very good also.  Amy Adams and Stanley Tucci were both great as well.
B000026KGC|4.0|I remember finding this album in the early 90's when I was working as a college radio station DJ.  I though the cover was kind of odd, so it caught my eye.  I had heard of Deep Purple, but not this version.  Deep Purple MK1 featured Rod Evans on vocals (check out Captain Beyond) and Nicky Simper along with founding members John Lord (keys), Ian Paice (drums), and Ritchie Blackmore (guitars).  Even at this early stage, you can hear John's classical keyboard approach and Ian's already exceptional drumming.  Interestingly, Ritchie still hadn't found his signature sound yet.    The sound of MK1 Deep Purple was decidedly psychedelic art rock with very little resemblance to \\"Smoke on the Water\\" MK2 era Deep Purple.  Thus, most fans tend to overlook these first 3 albums, what a shame.  On tBoT, the band steps up with some very bold original compositions and fewer cover tunes than their debut release.      \\"The Hard Road\\" was to serve as the band's instrumental live jam song even into the MK2 era before being replaced by \\"Lazy\\".  Starting off with a bit of orchestral bombast, the dual keyboard / guitar lead allowed Ritchie and John to strut their stuff live.  This is a very fun and rollicking track.    \\"The Shield\\" is one of my all time favorite songs.  This is a great psychedelic art rock tune.  It is both beautiful and haunting with a progressive rock overtone that was ahead of its time.  I just love this track because they threw so much into it, especially Ian's percussion without it ever sounding like a \\"wall of sound\\".    \\"The Anthem\\" is one of my other all time faves.  This is a ballad for people that don't like ballads.  Rod Evans vocals are perfect for this song.  He's got a bit of a crooner in him that works well with songs like this.  Once again, Ian's exceptional percussion work comes to the forefront.  Very few drummers at this time could even play anything as remotely complicated and understated.  John adds some exceptional classical organ and string arrangements that fit the \\"Taliesyn\\" theme of the album perfectly.  Ritchie even adds a wonderfully understated solo after hardly being heard till that point.    The rest of the album is comprised the psychedelic \\"Listen, Learn, Read On\\" and a trio of cover tunes.  One of the cover tunes, \\"Kentucky Woman\\" was a minor hit for the band.  I mark the album down a star because of the number of cover tunes, but make no mistake, three of the original compositions are extraordinary and worth the price of the disk alone.  The bonus tracks are also a nice addition.    As for the sound, what a welcome revalation.  The original LP from Tetragammon wasn't particularly good and the first CD's of this album were made from scratchy LP's (probably not \\"official\\" releases either).  This time, they went back to the original tapes so you can here everything clearly from Ritchie's piercing guitars to Nicky's thumping bass.  This is how the album was meant to sound.  Make no mistake, this record doesn't have the production quality of a modern recording, but this is so much better than it has ever sounded before.
B000NU2CY4|2.0|&lt;Complete excerpt from review on digitalbits.com> for which I wholey trust and respect the opinion of Bill Hunt, editor.<br /><br />Okay... so, I've seen Gladiator and Braveheart on Blu-ray this afternoon. I should let you know that I tried to get the discs from Paramount directly. They're usually very helpful and responsive in such situations, but they genuinely don't seem to have them available to send them out until early next week, for whatever reason. Given the controversy around the Net regarding the Gladiator transfer, however, I still wanted to be able to see the discs today myself - rather than comment on all this screenshot silliness - to make my own judgments and report here in time for you all to have fair warning prior to street date (9/1 - this coming Tuesday). It's your money, and you want to spend it wisely. You need information in order to do that.<br /><br />Let me first comment on the whole issue of screenshots. Judging a disc based on a few screenshots is, I think, silly. A screenshot represents 1/24 of a second of film. For a 2-hour film, that just 1/172,800th of the total visual information. You just can't properly judge a transfer based upon that little information. Screenshots CAN be illustrative of various kinds of image-related problems. But you really have to see the image in full motion to judge the complete context and impact of anything you see in a single frame grab. There's also the problem of potential alterations or artifacts that result from the frame-grabbing process itself, not to mention any changes resulting from image compression/editing software used by the poster - no matter how well intentioned - to present the frame-grab online. Finally, I've seen enough deliberately Photoshop doctored frame-grabs posted in discussion forums in my day that I just don't trust them. Ultimately, the only real way to judge these things properly is with your own eyes, first-hand, in context, in full motion, presented on proper equipment. Period.<br /><br />That being the case, an exhaustive search of retailers and rentailers in my area turned up a \\"mom and pop\\" rental shop nearby that had both Blu-ray titles available for rent prior to street date. I was able to pick up the discs this morning, and I've since gone through the transfers in some detail. I'm not going to talk about the extras - I'll do that in more detail next week, and I can tell you with confidence that the extras on both discs are absolutely first-rate. No complaints there whatsoever. As for the A/V quality, however, here's my two cents...<br /><br />Upon first glance, and as expected, the HD presentation quality of Gladiator isn't as bad as some online would have you believe. Color and contrast is fine at all times. The problem is with the level of detail. The vast majority of the film has a slightly digital-looking quality to it, and there's clear edge-enhancement \\"haloing\\" visible. The extended edition scenes, however, look fine - no halos, no digital patina - they're very natural looking. If the whole film looked like the extended scenes, we wouldn't be having this conversation. What it looks like to me, is that someone at Universal (keep in mind, it's Universal that controls the Gladiator assets for DreamWorks - not Paramount), decided to re-use the original digital master of the HD transfer done back in 2000 for the very first DVD release. Now, that transfer was state of the art for its day, and it was approved by director Ridley Scott, but obviously it's a far cry from the quality of new HD transfers done today, in 2009. One of the biggest problems is that until fairly recently, video mastering engineers were still applying edge-enhancement to their digital masters knowing that they were going to be used ultimately for standard-definition DVD release, and also analog VHS and laserdisc. It took the mastering community a long time to break the habit. In this Gladiator transfer, you can see it in the image. It's also clear that the2000 digital master has been digitally-filtered to reduce the haloing and other artifacts - the signs of DNR are not hard to miss. That's in contrast to the extended edition scenes, which were transferred in HD in 2005 and so look much better. They're still not quite up to today's standards, but they look far superior to the rest of the film and there's no edge-enhancement or obvious filtering visible. The footage simply looks natural - as it should. There's been some talk of DNR being so excessive that - for example - arrows and fireballs disappear from one frame to the next. This IS an issue, but the fact is that when you watch the image in full motion it's not something you really notice. The arrow or fireball is highly visible in one frame, less so in the next, more so in the third, etc. You still detect the object in motion, so you don't go, \\"Oh my god, that fireball just disappeared!\\" The image just looks generally digital and lacking in fine detail. Overall, I would grade the A/V quality of the Gladiator Blu-ray thusly:<br /><br />Gladiator<br />Video: 15.5 (theatrical footage)/17 (extended scenes)<br />Audio: 18<br /><br />Let me be clear: Gladiator on Blu-ray is quite watchable - especially if you have a smaller screen. On the comparative grading scale we use for Blu-ray, the very best DVD video and audio quality would be graded a 10. So it's definitely an improvement over the previous DVD releases. The problem is, the best Blu-rays - most high-quality titles on the format these days - score in the 18-19 range.

B00284BUJ6|5.0|For those wordsmiths eager to write well and to write RIGHT, this little gem here is the bible. Witty yet unequivocal in their treatment and guidance, nothing to date surpasses Strunk & White's \\"Elements of Style\\". My own copy sits close by my side as I type. It's dog-eared, coffee-stained, and tattered to shreds now. (Guess that couldn't happen with a Kindle!)
031606792X|5.0|I was very happy to see the book was in wonderful condition and it delivered quickly.

0345403959|4.0|This is the first prequel to the Belgariad and Malloreon (before Polgara the Sorceress).<br /><br />In this prequel, Belgarath tells us about his youth and how he became Aldur's pupil and then disciple, along with his brothers Zedar, the twins Belkira and Beltira, Belmakor, Belsambar and the dwarf Beldin.<br /><br />For a while they all live happily in the Vale, quietly studying, until Aldur's evil brother Torak steals the Orb and cracks the World.<br /><br />Then follows a history of the events that led to the birth of Garion the Godslayer: Belgarath's meeting the remarkable she-wolf who'll become his wife Poledra, the division of Aloria between Cherek and his sons Dras, Algar and Riva, the birth of his daughters Polgara and Beldaran, the start of the Rivan line and Torak's disciples' efforts to obliterate it, the Battle of Vo Mimbre...<br /><br />All the while, Belgarath and his brothers are taking care that everything clicks together, deciphering madmen's prophecies, and accordingly arranging meetings and marriages to ensure that Garion will be surrounded by the right companions when the time comes.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed re-reading this prequel more than the ten main volumes, even though Belgarath's flaunty remarks to the reader tended to rile me. Eddings's style and plot crafting has definitely improved during the years between the writing of The Seeress of Kell and this present volume. I hope I will now enjoy Polgara the Sorceress as much as I did when I first read it, it's always been my favourite among the lot!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|the editor's cut for Kingdom of Heaven is an even more informative and entertaining film than the first release.  I did not think I would/could enjoy anything more than the first release but was pleasantly surprised.  A must movie for anyone who enjoyed the first release or just wants to learn what happened after the First Crusade.
B001MEM7MW|4.0|FX has created another great drama. For some reason I missed it when it first ran but I'm ready for the season premiere now Sept 8.  This was my first run with Amazon Video on Demand and I am really disappointed.  I love buying music from Amazon but the streaming video is the pits.  I have a great connection and Netflix Online looks great on my TV (32\\" widescreen) all the time. Amazon has so much trouble that it looks like a decent webcam even when I run at half the screen size and the sound is often half a second to a second out of sync. I had a gift card for Amazon so I finished up the season (it's tolerable) but when iTunes is the same price, there is no contest.  I hope Amazon can improve it because it is nice having more than one marketplace for music and video.
0142000663|5.0|I love this book. Many of my friends have read it and hated it. But this is one of the best works I've ever had the pleasure of holding in my hand. I read it when I was a junior in high school and I just read it again and I've been graduated from college for almost seven years and it's still just as wonderful as the first time I read it. You'll read it and feel like you're a part of the family. You'll laugh and cry with them and even get angry. But please give this book a chance. It's so worth the adventure.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|Have always liked this movie and wanted to own it. Living in CA, what I do like about this movie is about the way things are in some parts of this state. Towards the end, the team did not win the finals BUT what matters is the passion that every player had. Secondly, the way coach made every hostile individual come together and work as a team. Excellent screenplay, can't say enough about this movie. KUDOS to Ken Carter - the coach whom the story was based upon. Wish every 5-10 yrs a Ken Carter is born and be the Catharsis of the society!!!
B000002BFZ|5.0|All Pearl Jam fans need this album. Their collection wouldn't be complete without it obviously, but this album adds a little something extra and just makes it different from all the others. My favorite song is \\"Red Mosquito\\" and I find myself listening to this album when I just need something random and off the wall to listen to. And the album cover alone is enough to keep you interested. Again, different but genius. Well done, PJ.
1416562605|4.0|I ordered this book because I am in a book club and it was the assignment for our next meeting.  It is an interesting look at India and the problems of today.  Parts were humorous, parts disgusting, parts surprising. and the author writes in his own personal style that is different from any author I have read.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|I'd put Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" right up there with the greatest albums of all-time. The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Ramones...an album I can listen to over and over again without getting sick of it. And the remaster is just even that more wonderful with the extra tuneage. Truly enjoyable. If I could give this album twenty stars I'd give it thirty - :)
B0000BWTK3|5.0|Even if you already own one or more excellent versions of this coupling (e.g. the superb Lupu one), I urge you to at least consider this disc. Andsnes has recorded the Grieg before, but I haven't heard that version so I cannot really compare. The playing here is at least mellifluous and wonderfully phrased and the lyrical, more reflective passages are splendidly done, with an acute ear for subtle shifts in mood and sonorities and a firm grasp of the overall argument. That is not to say that the performance lacks drama and flair - far from it; it is as smoldering and fiery as one would want; the point is that Andsnes brings an almost unrivalled lush ripeness to the music.    Part of what makes this performance so impressive is also the interplay with the orchestra, which itself gives a splendid performance (not surprisingly), and it is a virtue that despite its excellence, the soloist doesn't drown out the superb contributions from the Berlin players (there are particularly fine contributions from the brass, in particular in various solos).    The performance of the Schumann concerto is perhaps not quite as outstanding, even though it is still impressive. Here Andsnes sounds maybe a little less involved, less poetic and more matter-of-fact. Sure, the phrasing is still exquisite and there is much to admire about it - it does exhibit most of the qualities found in the Grieg performance after all - but overall the solo playing leaves me a tad cold. Perhaps it is a little superficial, only hinting at the depths of the layers of poetry? The orchestral contribution is however as impressive as in the Grieg, and Jansons lead a well-judged, finely paced performance with lots of color. And in the end I certainly don't want to sound to harsh; the virtues of this performance do without doubt far outweigh the slight traces of vices.    The sound quality is warm and vivid with lots of presence, and the balance is extraordinarily good in the Grieg (allowing us to hear all those important orchestral details), although in the Schumann the piano sounds perhaps a little too subdued (maybe the balance here is what is really mostly to blame for my small qualms concerning the performance?). Anyway, this is overall marvelous accounts, one to be set besides the classic Lupu/Previn one, for instance.
B002BTT0OA|5.0|This is definitely a page turner. Griggs has the gift of making you feel for the characters and what they're going through.  Especially since their issues are very close to home.
1591391105|3.0|These days we're lucky if we can get a single nugget of good business wisdom out of the glut of business books.  This one has a doozy: the very skills and behaviors which landed us the job in the first place may cost us the job---and our careers---in the end.    The book's strong suit is case study after case study of leaders who went off the rails in their first 90 days.  This makes for compelling reading---the Hindenburg's a lot more interesting than a routine New York to Chicago plane ride.      Where it falls down a bit is in the practical suggestions as to how to avoid their fate.  It lacks sufficient coherence and specificity to top what HR provides you.  Not exceptionally useful.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|Yes, another American reviewing a CD not available in the states except as an import.  I try my best to understand how such a great band can not crack the airways of the US but then again, I don't head a music company, I just recognize blissful music when I hear it.<br /><br />This A-ha offering is solid and reminds me of their first CD, both adventurous and so pop-synth entertaining.  The obvious hits to me are (in my order) Foot of the Mountain, Riding the Crest, The Bandstand and Mother Nature Goes to Heaven.  Keep the great music coming, Morten, Paul and Magne!  Don't allow the music industry think tank in the US to cloud the fact that you do have fans overseas in the US that realize just how good your music is.<br /><br />God bless.
B002AT4KA0|3.0|This is a great movie.  There's lots of action.  Maybe too much.  I'd rather see a better story behind it.  My favorite is still the original Fast and Furious movie.  Great to have Van Diesel back.  I would have liked to see more of his girlfriend Michelle.  I loved her in Blue Crush too.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|THE MOVIE<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino is, without question, my favorite director of all time. Aside from being a total movie geek, what I love about him is his intense passion to make great films no matter how long it takes. He's a perfectionist. Each one of his films are full-blown experiences. It's incredible to consider that his worst movies are probably [[ASIN:B000KX0ISG Reservoir Dogs]] and [[ASIN:B001F0TM5I Death Proof]], even though they're almost instant genre classics. He spent over a decade writing Inglourious Basterds and I've been waiting for it ever since I saw [[ASIN:B001BR5F4C Kill Bill]] (Vol. 2). As you can imagine, my hopes were high and I had a lot of expectations walking into the theater (which I barely made it into since Cinebarre doesn't understand what it means when you buy tickets in advance), but I'm glad that I didn't seek out leaked information or read the script before watching the movie. In fact, you should try to shield yourself from spoilers as much as possible, as well.<br /><br />So how did it stack up? It's almost certainly the best movie to come out so far this year. On one hand, it wasn't quite what I expected at all from the trailer and hearing comparisons to The Dirty Dozen. Part of the confusion comes from the fact that he wrote enough scripts to create 3 films, but it's not a World War II movie, an action film, or a dirty dozen homage. It's actually a very dialogue-heavy, cerebral spaghetti western that takes place during World War II and happens to have some very trademark Tarantino action scenes. All I can really tell you about the plot is that it's about a group of Jewish-American soldiers deep behind enemy lines in Nazi Germany who have a goal of killing as many Nazis as possible and giving the Nazis something to be afraid of.<br /><br />What I find really striking about this film, compared to all his movies since Reservoir Dogs, is that it's really slow-paced and yet it flies by. My friends were shocked when we walked out of the theaters more than 2 and half hours after the show started (including trailers). It's a movie characterized by a few long scenes focusing on very important dialogue. There are some random flashback sequences and moments of brutal violence, but there really aren't a lot of scene changes when you add it all up. As I was watching the movie, I was trying to remain skeptical and didn't feel that the dialogue was as quotable as it was in [[ASIN:B00006BSBW Pulp Fiction]] (which I hold is his masterpiece, even though I like Kill Bill the most), but I was wrong. There were a number of lines that stuck with me (some of which are in the trailers) that I say to myself every so often now. Each word almost feels like it's carefully crafted. My only criticism is that I felt on at least one occasion that the switch from using a foreign language to using English was a bit contrived, much like it was in Oren Ishi-i's speech to the Council. It's hard to complain though because I still loved those scenes in spit of that.<br /><br />Another striking quality, although this isn't really a huge surprise coming from Tarantino, is his attention to detail. This movie just bleeds details that you can't begin to appreciate on your first viewing. I really hope his costume designer is at least nominated for an academy award because they did a wonderful job of totally nailing the atmosphere and the time period. The sets were well put-together, as well. It's so perfect that I was a little sad to learn that German viewers had to watch a version with some Nazi iconography redacted due to federal law.<br /><br />I don't think I have enough words to praise the acting in this film. I think sometimes Brad Pitt is underrated because he's such a mainstream actor, but this may be his best role yet. No one could've been a better Aldo Raine than him. What's crazy is that he's not actually the star of the show - Christoph Waltz is as Hans Landa. He definitely needs an Academy Award for the tension that he sends down the spines of the audience. I didn't know who Cristoph Waltz was before seeing this movie, but I don't think I'll ever forget him as Landa whenever I see him in the future. I also have to give props to M&eacute;lanie Laurent as Shoshanna. Her emotions jumped off the screen and it was a really memorable performance. No one did badly, to be honest. The casting was perfect (as usual, for Tarantino), to put it simply.<br /><br />One more thing to note is that this movie had scenes in it that were very visually powerful. There were several shots in this movie that I think would look great as a still shot framed and hung somewhere. That's partially a tribute to the cinematographer, but obviously a lot of people are involved in making scenes like that. There's one image towards the end of the film that's so powerful that it comes to my mind every day now and has just stuck with me.<br /><br />I can't possible end this review without citing the fact that the tense scenes in this movie were so nerve-wracking that it was palpable. I've never been so afraid or anxious in a movie that wasn't in a horror genre before. Even though I felt a couple of times that he was being cheap in using music to build these moments, I appreciated how difficult they are to construct and didn't feel like they were being artificially dragged on but were just organic pieces of the film.<br /><br />I don't know how to criticize this movie, I honestly don't. There's a reason why it has the second highest grossing second-half of August opening and the best opening weekend for any Tarantino film. I can say that it did start out slow, and if you're not willing to stick with it you may be inclined to even walk out earlier, but it's imperative that you stay through the end. Some scenes definitely could've been a little shorter, and some of the violence could've stood to be a little less graphic (and stomach twisting), but I don't feel like these were major drawbacks by any means. The humor in this movie was consistently fun and refreshing, and the provocative scenes were just as fun to watch unravel as your favorite scenes were in Pulp Fiction. If you're not squeamish, I cannot recommend this movie higher. I can see some people not appreciate how geeky some parts of this movie are, but you're going to be hard-pressed to find a movie this year with a better script or better acting. If you see it for nothing else please see it for those two things. I give this movie an A+, and I'm already dying to get my hands on it on Blu-ray (though I know that won't be until next year).<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />THE BLU-RAY<br /><br />This is the first new release from directorial giant Quentin Tarantino that is released on Blu-ray and DVD simultaneously. His previous films on Blu-ray were just adapted for the format and so they don't take advantage of Blu-ray's additional benefits (other than great picture and sound quality) or have high definition special features. It seems like each Blu-ray I buy gets better and better in terms of overall presentation and navigation and picture quality (not counting Harry Potters 3-5, which I didn't get on their release dates, anyway), and Inglourious Basterds takes very little exception to that rule.<br /><br />I think the overall picture quality of this Blu-ray may actually just barely surpass even Star Trek, but both look so good that it's honestly hard to judge. I don't think I've ever paused a Blu-ray before and had a hard time finding artifacts up close. They're usually not that bad and not noticeable while actually watching the film, but the fact that this movie looks just as crisp and clear when you pause as while you're watching it really speaks for the detail in every frame. Part of why I'm emphasizing pausing the film is that there are some really great shots that are wonderful portraits of an emotion or a plot device that I have to pause to get the full effect of, sometimes. Anyway, the colors always feel true and the detail in faces and objects and settings is unmistakeably meticulous. I didn't realize that my living room could be lit up so much by a movie set in World War II. To put it simply, this is the way a Tarantino film was meant to be enjoyed outside of a movie theater. Without a surround sound setup I'd feel weird to talk much to sound, but everything sounded great on my TV. It comes with subtitles and audio tracks in English, French, and Spanish, by the way.<br /><br />For a Blu-ray presented so well I was definitely surprised by the lack of attractive features. First off, I liked the case right off the bat and its reflective quality in the light. When I put in the disc I was very happy that Universal didn't decide to barrage me with trailers and other junk like my WB Blu-rays do without fail. It's sad that it's become so prevalent that starting a disc with the main menu or feature film is something worth calling out. Anyway, it's cool that if you have a BD Live enabled player you get a ticker off to the right side with news that you can easily turn off and menu sound effects are optional (and default to being off). This is actually my first movie to take advantage of the 4 colored buttons on my remote: you can use them during the movie to help mark clips of the movie you like for easy reference and sending to friends (who I beleive must also have the disco watch your favorite scenes, which seems a bit silly but I can definitely understand why the studios would want it. Anyway, these options actually show up while your pause or seek during the movie, or if you hit 'down'.<br /><br />As I alluded to, the special features are definitely lacking. I knew there was something to be concerned about when I realized that a 2-disc edition meant that one had to be a digital copy, which expires if you don't remember/have the time to use it before then. Anyway, only a few of the extras are in 1080p with the rest being in 720i (the box claims 1080i, but it didn't look it) or 480p. The best extras are the trailers, the posters, and the round table with Tarantino and Brad Pitt. The other stuff is surprising unexciting. There are a couple of fun things, like a behind-the-scenes look at Nation's Pride (that film itself is also included, but less than 10 minutes long) and greetings to the editor during takes, and then a couple of serious pieces, like a discussion of the posters in the movie and some interviews and behind-the-scenes looks with the creator of the original Inglorious Bastards and one of its stars, but that's about it. The 3 extended scenes included aren't very exciting and there's still a scene in the trailers that I haven't seen in its entirety so Universal is definitely holding back on us. There's also a trivia game and some BD Live features like live chat, streaming previews of other films, and sending clips to friends, but these are also just little things. If they had just included a commentary track I think it would've helped a lot. But alas, there are a still a few scenes that I'd like to know the original intentions of and I'll never know the intentions of, now.<br /><br />Despite the failings of the special features, I think the picture quality of the feature film alone is enough to sell it. This is a movie with really great replay value, in my opinion, and that looks good enough that you'll really want to keep putting it in. I highly recommend it and think that the pros of this Blu-ray outweigh the dearth of special features to the point of earning 5 starts.scenes were just as fun to watch unravel as your favorite scenes were in Pulp Fiction. If you're not squeamish, I cannot recommend this movie higher. I can see some people not appreciate how geeky some parts of this movie are, but you're going to be hard-pressed to find a movie this year with a better script or better acting. If you see it for nothing else please see it for those two things. I give this movie an A+, and I'm already dying to get my hands on it on Blu-ray (though I know that won't be until next year).     Addendum:    THE BLU-RAY    This is the first new release from directorial giant Quentin Tarantino that is released on Blu-ray and DVD simultaneously. His previous films on Blu-ray were just adapted for the format and so they don't take advantage of Blu-ray's additional benefits (other than great picture and sound quality) or have high definition special features. It seems like each Blu-ray I buy gets better and better in terms of overall presentation and navigation and picture quality (not counting Harry Potters 3-5, which I didn't get on their release dates, anyway), and Inglourious Basterds takes very little exception to that rule.    I think the overall picture quality of this Blu-ray may actually just barely surpass even Star Trek, but both look so good that it's honestly hard to judge. I don't think I've ever paused a Blu-ray before and had a hard time finding artifacts up close.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|This will be short:  This film is only one micro-millimeter away from being just as good as the original \\"Rocky\\".  It is poignant, well-written, very well acted, and, if you'll forgive the boxing terminology, it packs quite a punch.      Folks, when I first heard that Stallone was doing yet another \\"Rocky\\" sequel, my first response was, \\"He's GOT to be kidding, right???\\"  I just couldn't believe it, and I thought that it was a sure sign that Stallone's career really was over.  I was certainly sad to think that, because I've always been a big fan.    This is one of those very rare occasions that I was well and truly wrong about something.  This is a very good film, and deserves to be given credit as being what it is:  The best of the \\"Rocky\\" sequels.  Stallone's writing and acting, as well as his direction of this film, haven't been this good in some time.      If you loved the original \\"Rocky\\", and you haven't already done so, SEE THIS FILM!      You'll thank me later.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|I love Bruce but he is dangerously close to being over exposed. Why he chose to put out this boring lifeless record I don't know. The wrestler is an excellent song. Working on a dream and my lucky day are pretty songs if not great. The rest of the record could have remained in the studio. I am glad for Bruce's late career renaissance but his talent would be better served if he would be more judicious in the work he puts out. Also I am not a big fan of the production of his latest records, I would like to hear a more raw and stripped down sound.
0385340990|3.0|This is a charming mystery that works well for a light hearted read.  It's not Hemingway, and it doesn't have to be.
0385341008|5.0|This is a book that should be rated a classic.  It is one of the best books of this decade.  It brings back memories of the war years but with such strong characters that you are laughing with them and then you migt cry.  It is not a dark book, this author manages to write a book about a very sad time but still manages to keep this story a happy one. I say read this book, you will not be sorry.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Good movie, just love it. Nice cars and great actors.  If you don't own this yet, go out and get it now.

B0000DJE9R|5.0|Excelent Disc.... The best CD for introducing MJ to new fans...  Compillate the MJ's best songs ever! And more... Listenin' this album, you'll want to buy another one, then another... You'll be addicted on Michael Jackson's songs... Buy it now!
B000P5FH3K|4.0|Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this 1997 John Grisham courtroom drama shows us the seedier side of lawschool graduation.  As Rudy Baylor (Damon) attests, Memphis is 'infested' with lawyers and it's hard to find a job if you worked your way through law school tending bar. He gets a job with \\"Bruiser Stone\\" (Rourke) and quickly learns the art of ambulance chasing from co-worker Deck (Danny DeVito) who's the firm's expert on insurance scams, but has never actually passed the Tennessee bar after six attempts.     When they get the case of leukemia patient Donny Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth) everything changes. The contract for the case is literally signed with the kid's spilled blood. He's dying and all he needs is a marrow transplant, which his insurance company declares is experimental.     Leo F. Drummond (Voight) is the high-dollar opposing counsel and the other side of the coin, complete with silver spoon and custom tailored suit.  Both sides employ every dirty trick in their arsenals to win, because as Baylor says--every lawyer crosses the line. This is one of the two strongest Grisham films made--in my opinion, \\"A Time to Kill\\" is still the best.     Rebecca Kyle, August 2009
B00000J7J4|3.0|I will say that Carlos Santana can still belt out a good guitar, but this wasn't as great an album as I was expecting. He does have his moments with the material he doesn't do with other artists. The songs like \\"De La Yarbo\\", \\"Africa Mamba\\", and \\"Primavera\\" were solid nuggets of jazz/fusion. Not saying that the material he did with other artists wasn't great. He has some moments there too like: \\"Love Of My Life\\" with Dave Matthews, \\"Maria Maria\\" with Wyclef, \\"The Calling\\" with Eric Clapton, and \\"Put Your Lights On\\" with Everlast. The 90's for the most part weren't kind to Carlos as Columbia, and Mercury both kicked him off their labels. He was fortunate to team up with Clive Davis again on Arista, and make a tremendous comeback that he did. However, it was overblown. I personally hate \\"Smooth\\" as it got too much airplay I feel. I still feel that Santana was at the top of thier game in the 60's and mid 70's. Yes some people felt as though he went off track with \\"Caravanseri\\", but I don't. I feel that Santana is capable of pulling off jazz/fusion splendidly. I will play \\"Shaman\\" to see if he does any better, but for this it's a good stab at a comeback, but not worth the 12 grammies it earned.
0792844890|4.0|I liked it even with the corney jokes. But my major beef is that it has spanish and french subtitles, But not English. What gives? Does Mel Brooks think there are no hearing impaired in the English speaking world? My hearing is fine and I still frequantly have the subtitles up.  And has one completely unnecessary use of the \\"F-Bomb\\"
B00000JHAU|3.0|3 1/2    Captures the group at their breezy-best..moody and melancholic at times for sure, but simplistic enough to shine through before future arrangement ambitions often stilted the process
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|I bought this album after i heard unreachable. (which is still my favorite song on the album) I've always loved the red hot chili peppers but i had never bought any of john's solo work. I mainly bought it because of RHCP. of the two songs i heard, (unreachable and central) i liked them a lot.<br />When i first listened to the album i was a bit dissapointed by the other material. but as i listened more i liked it more. all the songs are very thought out and meaningful. absolutely no filler. even though i don't quite understand the concept I'm sure it makes sense to mr. Frusciante. all in all great album.

0199536481|5.0|That is one of Oscar Wilde's many famous quotes, and if it was true, then Oscar would have been delighted to meet the main characters of LES LIAISONS DANGEREUSES. I certainly was.<br /><br />The Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont are wicked, possibly evil, and yet (and this can be attributed to Laclos's literary genius) they will probably become the characters you end up rooting for. Laclos, during his life, continued to insist that this novel was written for instructional purposes, a sort of this-could-happen-to-you type thing, but I'm not so easily fooled. Laclos, throughout the story, points out which characters are good and upstanding or plainly innocent (Tourvel, Rosemonde, Volanges) but he really wants you to hate these characters, and he uses the subtle language in their letters to achieve this. On the other hand, he makes the 'bad' characters (Valmont, Merteuil) more charming using the same technique. In other words, I believe that Laclos was trying to test his readers' principles. You know that what the Vicomte and the Marquise are doing is wrong... but you can't help wanting them to succeed and get away with it. You are bending your own morals because--while their victims are annoying and gullible--you find them to be witty, clever, and charming. And these are just fictional characters. What would happen if you met such people in real life?, Laclos seems to be asking.<br /><br />Clever though they may be, Valmont and Merteuil eventually reach a point in their twisted game where they cannot control it, and though they were once unholy allies, they become sworn enemies out of spite. They have already ruined so many other people, and now the time has come to ruin each other. [SPOILER WARNING] However, Merteuil, probably the more wicked of the two, gets away with her life, which is more than can be said for Valmont. There is even a note in the back of the book which suggests that she even overcame her deformities (caused by smallpox) and continued her way of life in Amsterdam. [END SPOILERS] They are not the only ones to suffer. Their victims are all brought down by their scheme, in different ways and in varying degrees of disaster. Again, Laclos uses his deceptive writing skill to make it seem like these characters deserved their fates because of their stupidity or naivete, without actually saying this at all. The reader ends up feeling worse for Valmont and Merteuil, who undoubtedly deserved their punishments. It is almost impossible to describe what Laclos has done in a review. You must read the actual novel in order to feel the sheer genius in it, the way he conveys meaning between the lines, without actually writing anything out to that effect. It really is like nothing I've ever seen before.<br /><br />If I could give this masterpiece more than five stars, I would. This is the art of literature at its finest, and Laclos will have you under his spell the whole way through.in Amsterdam. [END SPOILERS] They are not the only ones to suffer.

B00000IPAX|2.0|That's what this album left me with. I guess I have to be fair about it though considering Green Day would only release a greatest hits compilation between 1997's \\"Nimrod\\", and 2004's \\"American Idiot\\". However, I found this to be a mediocre album. It does thrash I'll say that much, and the guitar is way beyond aggressive, but the vocals sound like a prepuberescent teen's vocals.....very whiny, and trying to sound tough. I also had a hard time following this album as it seemed like they played almost the same song after leaving off the last one. The album cover is sexy that's a plus, but not worth my money. This is for those who never heard of Green Day, but chances are if you never heard of Green Day you would never have heard of these bums either.

B0017M8XS6|5.0|I am intimately familiar with this work of music having listened to it a gazzion times (and THAT is a lot!!) since it first came out and sitting here listening to the SACD disc in this set and it is literally like listening to a brand new recording. It truly is amazing how much more there is to and IN the music. I have a lot of SACDs but this takes the prize, well deserved. The dynamics and attention to sonic detail are amazing.<br />WAY beyond the DTS edition that I have.<br /><br />If you have a good system and an SACD player, buy this, the price for the SACD alone is worth the cost.<br /><br />Sure wish more SACDs with this kind of quality would be released by SOMEONE!!!!
0307588335|5.0|What a great book.  Being in the financial business myself, I was happy to read about the collapse of Lehman Brothers and how it affected the rest of the country.  I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B000002G6J|5.0|Tom, of course, is Antonio Carlos Jobim, easily the most important figure in the bossa nova (the new thing) period of the late 50s and the early 60s.  Jobim wrote beautiful music that still intrigues anyone who takes the time to listen.  \\"Wave\\", the title piece of this album, is one of my favorite pieces of music.  Trombones with Tom on the piano, displaying not such much his piano skills as his ultimate sense of musicianship.  I also love \\"Look to the Sun\\".      Bossa nova touches something timeless in us, I think.  It's wistful, carrying us along on a wave of beauty that never quite translates into joy but rather into fate and inevitability.  The lyrics of Wave express that idea, but the music does it better.  The metaphor of the wave is Brazilian fatalism and romanticism, and the timeless beauty of Rio.  It's a vision that Jobim's music captures with stark beauty.    If you like the song \\"Wave\\" as much as I do, be sure to get Oscar Peterson's incredible version of it.  Utterly fantastic, a masterpiece.
B000009ED0|1.0|It's a proven fact that Rap and Metal can mix together in perfect harmony. I mean where do I stop?: The Beastie Boys, Anthrax, Biohazard with Oynx, and Rage Against The Machine. These are the founding fathers of Rap and Metal, so it's possible to do, but this was pathetic. Not saying all the songs were bad, but alot of them were. \\"Batiwada\\" was o.k, \\"I Am The Bullgod\\" is the first song I heard from Kid Rock, so it's the best, and \\"Someone's Gotta Feel This\\" was also good, but the rest is enough to make me want to throw up. I don't know what could've been done to save this disc, but it's too late now. However, Kid Rock does show enough talent to actually sing a song without the jigga-jigga-scratch, and that's on \\"Only God Knows Why\\". It's a shame that I hate that song, but I'll give him credit that he actually did it. I guess I can identify with Kid Rock in one way we're both single fathers, and we need to go out, and work for a living to provide for our children, but this was a stupid debut. I don't know if he get's any better, or not I will have to play the rest of his albums. He does prove he can sing with the song \\"Picture\\", so maybe there's hope. Let's just forget about this one, and chalk it up to getting it out of his system.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is my all time favorite album of any genre. Every song on it is good and you will listen to it over and over and over. If you don't own this musical masterpiece, you are missing out on some fantastic tunes. Bono, Larry, Adam, and The Edge are at their very best.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Ok, I just got these today, and any fears I had about hissing were unfounded. Even when a game or movie was silent, there wasn't any discernible hint of white noise or hiss whatsoever. I did have to sync the headphones to the base initially (very simple) and that was it. No matter where I was in the room (and even when I wandered away a bit) the sound was perfect. I experimented with Fallout 3 and was blown away. The directional sound is amazing. My biggest issue was jumping out of my skin when someone in the game spoke next to me (I though my wife was talking to me - it was an NPC and it was crystal clear and located perfectly spatially.) Of course this is an early review, and I will update if problems arise. Also, not even a hint of lag (so long, Bluetooth!)  Yeah, they were pricey, but I threw a couple of gift certificates at it to ease the pain. Tried one movie (Master and Commander) and it sounded like I was really on the ship.   First impression is amazing - this really is a leap in quality over other headsets. And trust me, my OCD was looking for a reason to be disappointed - there wasn't one.
0452295548|5.0|I bought this book after I was diagnosed with MS, in my attempt to gain some more insight into how the brain and the central nervous system work. This book proved for me a real inspiration. It is written in simple language and it is fun to read (even the chapters with the \\"heavy\\" medical stuff). Not only did it help me understand that our behavioral patterns are based on hard biological facts, but it also took me one step further, providing scientific evidence for the value of \\"here and now\\" (Krishnamurti's and Eckhart Tolle's teachings) as well as for the core meanings of Eastern philosophies (e.g. nirvana, oneness, etc.) that I always found intriguing. I strongly recommend it.
1423101472|4.0|I'm one of those analytical types that like to gauge audience loyalty.  I asked 100 adults and 50 children in suburban Denver if they knew who Harry Potter was. Yes, 100%.  Do they know who Percy Jackson is? -- no they don't. NOT ONE! I didn't even find a KID who knew who Percy was.  Artemis Fowl was equally unknown.  Isn't that sad? I enjoyed the entire Percy Jackson series (I like Artemis Fowl too though) -- thanks Rick.  Give your son a hug from me.
B000JLSM00|5.0|This is a great story and the Blue-ray quality is unbelivable.  If you love the movie, you will love the Blue-ray even better because it captures the high definition detail of the original movie that was before its time. I especially like the end of the movie where Wayne swaggers.
B0027G783W|3.0|Easy listening Cd from Moby.  Not too bad, not one of his best, but is a Cd I listen to in the background whilst doing work around the house.  Couple of excellent songs on this Cd with a couple of others a bit ordinary.  Certainly an individual taste this Cd.
0786838655|5.0|For the past several years, my 13 1/2-yr-old grandson had basically lost interest in reading. I have been trying to find something to pique his interest and reinstill a love of reading.  The Lightning Thief was a great choice - for the first time in quite a while, he was reading and enjoying the thrill of an exciting story. He actually wants to read the next book in the series!  I recommend this highly to anyone with a young teenage reader who needs to be reminded there are books to capture their attention and make reading an enjoyable pastime.
B00007KWHP|5.0|This is Yes in their prime, with Rick Wakeman joining the band and the music gaining a cleaner sound.  Complex insrumental interplay is the order of the day, but always in the service of some very fine \\"songs\\" (compositions might be a more accurate term).    This record brings us the swinging \\"Roundabout\\", the driving and ringing \\"South Side of the Sky\\", and \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" which reminds me a bit to much of King Crimson's \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" but is lifted into new territory by Anderson's melody and singing.  Some shorter pieces complete the experience, which is delightful and not quite like anything else in the world.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|Long over-due and in my opinion totally AWESOME.  The only thing better would be a complete box set of every single one of her videos.
B00127RAJY|5.0|After an intensive senior year of college I put on a few extra pounds and was feeling down on myself before my wedding.   I started really cutting out excessive foods, alcohol, soda, snacks, and trying to work out at home (it's too hot outside in Central Texas in the summer) but it just wasn't enough.    Since one of my wedding registries is on here, I decided to look up workout DVDs. I work from home so I figured it would be perfect. How could I say no to buying this DVD after seeing all of these positive reviews?  I'm on Day 12 of the 30 days and already I am seeing results! I've lost 3 lbs and toned so much! I'm loving the flatter stomach this is giving me!  My fiance says I look great and I'm feeling great too!    These workouts are HARD, don't get me wrong. I just moved on to Level 2 and it is killing me by the end of it. She fits in like 6 different plank exercises! They're hard, but they're over soon and you really feel accomplished by the end. I like Jillian's style, she's honest but not mean.     I've been blogging about each day of my shred experience and a bunch of my friends have now bought the DVD.  I definitely recommended it!
B0014H32MG|3.0|I am only leaving this review for one purpose, to warn you about a spoiler in the intro.  Don't worry I am not going to spoil it for you to.  In the intro by King called The Importance of Being Bachman, he quite literally tells you the ending.  It took a lot of the fun out of the book, and I just wanted to let others know that the spoiler was in there.
B00007LTIC|4.0|\\"Awaken\\" is prime-grade Yes in the style of Relayer, going for the gusto and dropping serious musical virtuosity on the world.  The rest of the album's pretty dispensible though, an attempt at commerciality that sounds a bit Zeppelin-inflected on the title track.
0307120007|1.0|I bought this after having purchased and read \\"Wet Pet Dry Pet Your Pet My Pet\\" by Dr. Seuss and \\"Touch and Feel Home\\" by DK Publishing.  Needless to say, my 9 month old could care less about Pat the Bunny as it's not nearly as \\"interesting\\" to him as the other books are.
B001FB55HG|3.0|This movie to me was a disappointment. The terminator series is one of my favorites but this movie was just a let down. Now, for the avid action flick person that is only interested in good action this movie is great. But for the terminator fan who wants to see some good story progression and the series go forward, this movie is a letdown.<br /><br />1)I'll start off with my first complaint, even if it is a small one. I'm not a fan of Christian Bale. I think he is a GREAT GREAT Batman, but a John Connor he is not. Even though the John Connor in T2 annoyed the crap out of me, I'd rather see him again than Christian Bale. The fact that this movie was more about Sam Worthington's character than John Connor should be a negative, but the fact that this made me have to endure Bale's horrible acting less made it not such a negative.<br /><br />2)Overall, what was the point of this film? I can only think of 2 important happenings in this film. 1) Connor meets his father and 2) Connor becomes the leader of the resistance. (and the 2nd really could have been lumped somewhere else) I mean, basically, the only thing that happens in this movie is John Connor and the resistance are able to take out a region of skynet. Why did I have to endure Bale for 2 hours to see that? Worthington's character in the grand scheme of things was pointless. T1, the whole story of judgement day and the terminators is set up...important. T2, (and IMO the worst of the first 3) the same story is furthered and for the first time a machine is working for the humans...important. T3, the realization that judgement day cannot be prevented and it actually happens...important. T4...yeah nowhere near as important as the first 3.<br /><br />3) Why all of a sudden can the terminators survive molten steel? In T2, arnold offs himself (not directly) by being lowered into a pool of molten steel but in this movie, molten steel gets poored all over the T800 and it busts out? Bahh<br /><br />4) How predictable was this movie? Connor gets stabbed through the heart and robo-worthington gives his up? I guess we should ignore the fact to have a heart transplant, the dimensions of your chest cavity have to be pretty close, and your bloodtype has to be the same or compatible.<br /><br />5) Where was Kate Connor? I mean she is a huge character in the terminator series after judgement day? She is the future leader of the resistance and, while I think Howard did a good job with her, there wasn't nearly enough of her.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is the worst terminator movie so far. Does it kill the series for me? No. I realize that every series has to have a low point. Now if T5 is as bad as this movie, then the series may well be dead for me. I hope by the time it comes out, Christian Bale can muster up some non-bruce wayne acting skills and pull off a respectable John Connor. I still think this movie is worth seeing and if you aren't a HUGE terminator fan like me, then you will probably like this movie. The movie, by itself is decent. The movie, when put with the other terminator movies, not so decent.s movie? Connor gets stabbed through the heart and robo-worthington gives his up?

B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you are a fan of the Firefly series this is a must buy!  I just wish they wrapped up the series a bit better in the movie but could understand why they didn't. Here is to hoping they come out with some straight to dvd movies.
B00007LTIA|3.0|I can hear that they are trying to do the same basic things that they did on \\"Close to the Edge\\", though here they are trying to weld musical fragments together into not one but four side-long pieces.  Some of the musical themes and fragments here are of a high quality level - brilliant, I'd say.    But stretching them out over this much space, interspersed with musical silliness (drum solos, acoustic guitar soling, and that pseudo-ethnic stuff on Side 3), and organizing it around mystical/spiritual nonsense did not serve the band well.  Their ambition got the better of them.  They went from dense to diffuse.    I accept Bill Bruford's assessment of the band circa this time frame, as he says in his autobiography - to some extent, in some way, their luck came together on \\"Close to the Edge\\", and presumably that luck didn't hold up here.  Had they lowered their sights they could probably have turned this into a fine piece or two.

B00007KWHO|4.0|I've only marked this record at 4 stars because some of the tracks are mediocre and one gives me a headache (\\"Sweet Dreams\\").  Much of the record is near 5 stars though.  The band's ambition starts to coalesce here.  \\"Then\\" and \\"Everydays\\" are great instrumental framing of Anderson's unique voice; \\"No Experience Needed\\" is another great baroque cover song played with abandon; \\"Astral Traveler\\" is an extremely tasty rhythm track that foreshadows what was yet to come from this band and from Squire/Bruford.
0596101996|5.0|I have to agree with the bulk of the reviews that I've read about this book:  it IS the DEFINITIVE guide to Javascript.  I'm just learning Javascript, and I bought another book that was an overly gentle introduction to Javascript (since I've been programming for quite some time), and after I went through that one and another one, I finally bought this one, and I half expected that it would be a little bit hard to chew at this point in my Javascript learning curve:  not so!  There are very very few typos (I spotted a couple in the first 150 pages), and the author explains everything very very clearly.  I could scarcely be happier with this book than I am.    (This review concerns the new 5th edition.)
B0024HH32A|5.0|I have to be honest - this movie and resulting series both have an important hold on my memories of growing up and discovering what was going to make me laugh in watching TV. I also love BD and what it has done for our industry, so I went into this release with great expectations, and really, I was not disappointed (though it could always be better). If you already have the special edition that Altman cleaned up, this appears to be an identical transfer with no significant changes.<br /><br />The picture looks great compared to the original releases as most of the artifact has been removed and the color has been saturated extensively - but in a good way. There is an apparent softness throughout, but compared to what the original product was, I don't mind. The DTS was not the greatest, and the front three channels get all the work. I even tried the football game and some jeep scenes but nothing gets around to the rear channels much. The supplements are identical to the special edition release (roughly 5 hours of docus and extras on all the other DVD sets) with a couple exceptions here:<br />* Still Gallery - 70 pics that had to be taken from the BD transfer as they are very crisp. Screen saver worthy.<br />* Complete Interactive Guide: A fun tally on all things done by the characters. When activated, a headshot pic pops up while that person is on screen and a cumulative number appears referencing how many drinks or fights partaken, and/or court martials that should be happening. When there are large volumes of people on the screen the shots take up the whole top and bottom half of the set, but it helps keep track of who enters and leaves each scene. Worth doing once you have watched the film and have time to kill. Customers walking by the screening actually liked this option as it is a nice review of the supporting actors.<br /><br />There are subs in Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Dubbed in Spanish and French with an English 2.0 option. A Portguese trailer was thrown in for good measure. Overall, the picture turned out nice and the sound better than before, and this would be a nice upgrade if you did not already get the other set. I noticed much more grain on a larger display but the smaller LCD panels showcased a solid preservation. Hope you enjoy.asure.

B0027HOBM2|5.0|I won't put any spoilers in this review in hopes of not ruining anything for those who haven't seen the show.  The second season feels very similar, and very different than the first.  The first season was fresh and something with great style.  However, when it ended I felt the story was complete.  As if they weren't sure if they would get a second season, and as such ended the story (though left it open if need be).  The second season greatly felt far more like it was done with the knowledge of a third and on season.  Really, it felt more like a set up for the third season than its own independent story.  New characters were introduced toward the end of the series, and large changes occured at the very end of the series, as if they were aware that the show would go on.    That being said, the show improves in a lot of areas.  The characters certainly continue down whatever path they had, be it one of self discovery or instead finding status in a world that doesn't want to provide status to them.  I enjoyed some of the twists, and especially was impressed watching the disentegration of January Jones throughout the season.  While I didn't feel as complete at the end of this season as the first, I did feel I knew the characters a bit better.  Highly recomended.
B00009Z574|4.0|Squire, White, and Howe sound tremendous here and really tight.  You can tell that they'd been listening to the Police; it's even more obvious on \\"Drama\\" but I hear it here as well.  Those guys are laying down the law here, playing rock that rocks hard while it swings.  It's crazy the way Captain Beefheart is crazy - deeply rhythmic.    Anderson and Wakeman manage to do this and that on top of the music and there's some pretty great material on here, albeit not as crisply recorded as previous offerings.  The lyrics, again, will turn some people off.
0767817478|2.0|Aside from the fact the creature in this movie is named \\"Godzilla\\" and is a product of man-made weapons testing, this movie shares relatively nothing in common with the Godzilla movies made by TOHO. Rather than attempt to emulate the dark and meaningful 1954 movie and perhaps strengthen the message or expand on the message of the original, this movie presents itself as a mystery to the audience. I did not know whether I was supposed to root for or against Godzilla because this movie transformed Godzilla into a tragic figure, if you can believe it, rather than present the monster as force of Nature sent to punish man for his arrogance, the embracing of destructive tendencies and desire to kill. I think actually that this movie shares more in common with the original King Kong in the way it portrays Godzilla. Both creatures appear in the state of New York, one brought by force the other by choice, but both a victim of man's desire for power. Both seek something rather than destruction. Both are killed in manner which can be considered tragic. What works for King Kong just does not work for Godzilla because Godzilla was never intended to be portrayed in this way. None of the dozens of TOHO movies or comic book stories or novels or anything has ever presented Godzilla with this type of storyline or background and it simply does not work. The people in charge of this movie simply came to the table with the wrong philosophy, in my opinion.      If the movie wasn't titled \\"Godzilla\\", I think I would enjoy it more, but because of the name, I keep thinking just how much better this movie could have been if so many things had not be mishandled, including the script and monster design. With this movie's budget, this movie could have been an incredibly terrifying yet quite meaningful with messages and definite entertainment value. It is a real shame that it was reduced to a little more than a \\"fish out of water\\" story than anything else. Such an incredible amount of wasted potential!

B000VUDSH6|2.0|I love Jackie Chan, so it pains me to give this movie a mediocre at best review.  There must be some contract with action stars that requires them to do a lame baby movie at least once in their carreer (I'm looking at you Vin Diesel).  As to this one, its not per se a bad movie, the action is decent, but the story is fairly weak, following the usual, \\"I'm so cool I don't need kids around, but wait I reluctantly have to take care of a kid, and after some time really like the kid and eventually must save it\\" story.  There are of course the standard poopy diaper and peeing in the face jokes one would expect as well.  So why didn't I give it one star, well, the actors are pretty good, given what they have. And Jackie pulls off a few great action/comedy moments.  So in all, the movie is not particularly great, but was watchable.  Recomended if you're looking for another jackie chan film, or are really into cliche baby movies.
B00007KWHN|5.0|Now the band's ambition is harnessed into something great.  Put Steve Howe alongside Chris Squire and Bill Bruford, and something great's going to happen.  What did happen, with Jon Anderson helping to shape and singing like noone else, is timeless music if you ask me.    Forget \\"Your Move/All Good People\\" which is a Crosby Stills & Nash rip-off.  \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\", \\"Starship Trooper\\", and \\"Perpetual Change\\" are brilliant compositions played with energy and precision.
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|\\"Wanted\\" provoked a question in me: how could a movie so fundamentally hollow be so much fun to watch?<br /><br />There's no doubt about it ... \\"Wanted\\" is fun. First of all, it employs a serious arsenal of mega-watt talent: Charming and adorable James McAvoy, the always-seductive Angelina Jolie back in sexy bad-ass mode, and the reassuring and paternal Morgan Freeman. Second, it's full of state-of-the-art action and special affects, which has caused the (unwarranted, sadly) comparisons to the original \\"Matrix\\" film. And third, there is an entertaining (but forgettable) storyline involving assassins and a secret society.<br /><br />Once you get past all the sexy fun, the film is, sadly, hollow. The central premise of the film seems to be that working in an office makes you a sad loser. When we're living in a time when unemployment is in the double digits and people with college degrees are flipping burgers to make ends meet, this is an insulting thesis. The film also proposes that violence = empowerment. The central character, after being trained to be an assassin, becomes self-assured and sexy. In her supporting role, Angelina Jolie provides the film's true emotional core ... beneath her character's confidence and sex appeal, she's a broken-hearted, lost soul.
B00288KNLS|4.0|I was disappointed that the 3-D version of the movie is not the same as the one shown in theaters. Instead of the polarized system, it uses the standard color lenses. This should have been noted on the product details, as I feel misled. Still, a good movie.

I'll go on record that \\"Siberian Khatru\\", \\"Perpetual Change\\", \\"Yours is No Disgrace\\", and \\"Starship Trooper\\" are superior here to their studio versions.  These are great compositions - sophisticated but full of melody - played brilliantly by virtuoso musicians.  It's some of the best music I've ever heard, certainly, and I can't recommend it highly enough.
0312330537|5.0|\\"Reading makes immigrants of us all. It takes us away from home, but more important, it finds homes for us everywhere.\\"<br /><br />I found this quote in a book of quotations while reading `Shantaram' by Gregory David Roberts.  While the 900+ pg novel is a journey in itself, I don't believe a book has ever transported me as this did.  This was partly due to my unfamiliarity with the region, but most of the credit goes to the talented author.<br /><br />GDR delivers a story where a country plays as important a role as any character. India is the protagonist and a tremendous respect and love pours from the text.  The people residing there are vital figures in the tale, but I've never read such praise for surroundings.  He presents an aura around India and its people, while not sliding into supernatural sentiment.<br /><br />At times, `Shantaram' reads like poetry, but it's a thrill ride.  There are very few lulls; it is chock full of action.  Any confusion with a romance novel (the cover could give that sense) will be gone with an early introduction to India's under-belly.  Although extremely violent and graphic, GDR manages to mix in stories of love and community that will appeal to all.  I know that's a wide demo, but it's true.<br /><br />His story was drawn from his actual escape from an Australian prison and exile in India. There seems to be some controversy over how much of it is based in fact, but GDR clearly presents this as a novel. I fail to see how it matters, once invested in such a heart-pounding story.  'Shantaram' took me to a land of little interest, and I departed with hopes of returning again.
1594202249|3.0|Pynchon, a perceptive and hilarious writer, perhaps even a genius, sees the world in black-and-white while claiming to perceive its hidden spectra.  This, his seventh novel, published at the age of 72, is his best at depicting familial relationships.  But often these moments take a back seat to characters who act out sexually as if internal biological lubrication were the only reason to wake up in the morning.  The normal consequences which normally follow these acts fail to occur in Pynchon's world:  no STD's, no unwanted pregnancies, no appointments at an abortion clinic, no feelings of guilt or shame.  (One character is abused by her spouse, but we are informed of this second-hand, and her recovery (if any) is glossed over.)  Even the question of why these characters act the way they do is ignored.  In the real world, emotional problems trigger this kind of behavior -- does Pynchon really believe that \\"everyone does it\\" to the level he depicts?<br /><br />His political beliefs are similarly skewed.  Ronald Reagan and Charles Manson are both referred to but do not appear in \\"Vice\\".  I had thought that given the novel's theme, the turn from psychedelic experimentation in the 60's to the paranoia of the 70's, that Pynchon would turn his powers of perception upon Manson.  Manson wasn't a rogue cop, or the LAPD, or a Republican bent on nuclear war -- he was one of the psychedelic scene.  But in the end, the only conclusion Pynchon can make is that: Manson was bad; perhaps Reagan was worse.  If this represents Pynchon's true political leanings, then that is truly a pity.<br /><br />Drug use in this novel comes off relatively better, if uneven.  Our pot-loving protagonist is a true out-of-it doper in one chapter and remarkably sly in the next.  He can't manage how to live his life well, but makes it to the shooting range regularly enough to be a crack shot.  Harder drugs are mentioned and used, but no one ends up in the ER, or even a therapist's office.  Heroin is the only drug that gets a truly bad rap.<br /><br />As is the case with \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", it's hard to take Pynchon's comic book characters (as in comic books from the 40s and 50s), two-dimensional political analysis (We Good, They Bad) and his dead serious social and cultural critiques with any degree of gravity (PhD's in Lit notwithstanding).  His omniparanoia about Them, the ones who secretly control everything, smells deeply of BS in 2009.<br /><br />I still give this book three stars for its wonderful moments: the subplot concerning Coy Harlington and his family, Sportello's own parents, the 25\\" color TV with the enthralling educational program, Pynchon's rich vocabulary, and, of course, that dead-on rant about Charlie the Tuna.
B00007KWI9|4.0|The music has drive and flair.  They got better later; this is a record that will appeal to committed fans or to fans of psychedelic 60's garage-band music which this is a fine wigged-out example of.    Many of the songs center on Anderson's voice and his singing is impressive.  For instrumental flair check out the hard-driving \\"Beyond and Before\\" and the albums two covers (\\"I See You\\" and \\"Every Little Thing\\"), each of which are done with energy and imagination to spare.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Can a recording be both philosophical and sexy? The answer is yes - and \\"Ten New Songs\\" is both. I resisted getting this for a while, but, unlike many recordings that heavily rely on synthesizers, I found this one to work unbelievably well. Cohen and Sharon Robinson are a winning and surprizingly sultry combination. Her voice and accompaniment, along with the production, perfectly compliment \\"The Master's Song\\".  His words are both powerful and minimal but evoke a detached enlightenment and ironic romanticism that Cohen has continued to refine over the years. His voice is like a tuning fork that immediately sets one's brain waves to deep alpha. She is the feminine counterpart to his ancient, sacred beast. This material gets better and better and reveals more with each listening. A word should also be given to the engineering and mixing - the word is \\"superb\\".
B00003CXB4|5.0|What arrived in my mailbox was exactly what I had ordered. The Lion King has been one of my favorite movies since I was a child, and I'm glad I could purchase this item so easily. :) There is an added song... \\"Morning Report,\\" which I'm not fond of, but which I expected to be in the movie. Since it's the special platinum edition, it has a huge amount of special features, which I enjoyed. Great buy.

Wonderful songwriting, excellently performed, great arrangement, excellent vocals, great vocal arrangement, it's a GREAT album. And for a DEBUT album, it's absolutely fantastic! If I had to pick one thing WRONG with the album, I would have to say it's the album cover itself, and it's not bad.

B0025UHKNS|3.0|Before I start a bit of a background about my expedience: I am a web developer hence used to computer user interaction. I had the watch for over a month now and run around 75km with it. I am 43 years of age. My main usage is for running.     My observations are:    1. Hard to read while running. I recently started using reading glasses. I find the 3 field display too small to see and the other options good but I cannot read the text. So if I scroll the page (there are up to 4 pages you customize) it is hard to tell which page is it.  2. The bazzel operation while running is a bit hard.  3. The GPS is totaly off in the vicinity of any obstraction building or trees.  4. The HR measurement is a bit strange. I thought it was working fine until yesterday I run a hard trail through the woods and the GPS was off and also the HR. How they or why are these two connected I am not sure but  take a look at my HR here: [...]. My HR is around 161, which is totally wrong. I am trying to figure it out with support.  5. The watch has a problem that is not covered in the manual; if you travel around the world you need to reset the satellites and reacquire in the new location.  Otherwise the watch will take a very long time to acquire satellites each time you start running. Not a big deal if you are aware of it.    My conclusion is positive BUT you HAVE to buy a foot pod with this device. Unless you live are in very rural area with no trees and building are spaced really nice from each there. so the real cost is more that just the watch!    PS: just ordered the foot pod.

It's more mellow than the original one.  Can't decide if I like it or not; kind of grows on you.  I wish they would have put BOTH of them on this DVD.

B00140PK6O|4.0|I should begin by saying that I came to this BBC DVD full of curiosity as to how the producers would choose to adapt Mrs Gaskell's novel. Ever since discovering her novels some three decades ago, I've been a fan of her writing.  Unlike Thackeray, who is charming but somewhat distant (at least for me) or Dickens, who is (in my opinion) too often over-blown and given over to sentimentality, or George Eliot, who intrudes too much with her use of Authorial Voice, Mrs Gaskell is a minimalist. Working on a very small canvas - in this case the small village of Knutsford, here transformed into the fictionalized Cranford - she delicately and incisively picks out many themes that are otherwise almost entirely neglected by her contemporaries. Subjects such as the emancipation of women and their suitability to take larger roles in society are exquisitely touched upon, but unlike Dickens or Eliot Mrs Gaskell never hectors, never lectures, and never sets her art in second place to her desire for social reform.  In my mind this makes her more effective than her peers and certainly a more enjoyable read. I've often re-read North and South for pleasure whereas I've read Hard Times just once. Mrs Gaskell's book is balanced and thoughtful whereas Dickens' work is strident, crude and highly polar.<br /><br />So how did the BBC fare with their adaptation?  In one word: magnificently. Not only did the writer stay close to the spirit of the book (strictly, a book-in-three-parts, as was typical of the day), but also the director and crew did a superb job of trying to whisk us back in time. Most period dramas are too obviously modern-day actors and actresses in period dress; in Cranford we capture a much more authentic feeling of being back in the 1850s. Of course the actors still have teeth (which the real inhabitants of Cranford would too often have lacked) and they have nice skin that is free of flea-bites, rashes, and the other thousand-and-one inevitable blemishes that were the norm back then, and no one has any trace of pox-mark (again very common even in the well-to-do of the period) but we can overlook these things because they would shock a modern audience and detract from the story.  Instead, the producers cast older actresses for the lead roles which achieves nearly the same effect (in other words, modern-day actresses in their 50s and 60s made up to look very old and wrinkled are cast as characters who are chronologically a decade or more younger than the people who portray them). While with a good diet and healthy lifestyle one can be a very vital and youthful 60-year-old today, back in the 1850s women were nearly worn-out by their late 30s. Cranford captures this reality in a way that is not over-stressed but which creates the right undertone for the stories that unfold.<br /><br />Cranford is about life. About the women who missed out on it (all the many genteel spinsters who for one reason or another never married, raised families, or were able to go out into the world and contribute), about the younger generation who have more chances to move beyond the home and hearth, and about great loss of all kinds. Although the stories are generally light-hearted there is a great deal of death in Cranford, reflecting actual mortality rates of the day. There are broken dreams, hopes withered, and years lost to the river of time.  Most of all there is the dramatic tension between the old women who wish everything to remain static (because then, pace Miss Haversham in Dickens' later work Great Expectations, one can pretend that life has also stood still instead of raced on and passed one by) and those who accept and even embrace change as the mechanism by means of which life can, to some degree, improve.  Whereas Dickens would have taken sides, Mrs Gaskell allows us to see both sides as human, humane, and vulnerable.  Our sympathies are engaged while at the same time we see how there are no simple rights or wrongs. This BBC production is admirablefor retaining this multi-faceted aspect of Cranford and for being so delicate with the core themes. A glance from Miss Matty, now an ancient spinster whose own dreams of marriage turned to dust decades earlier, at the young and beautiful Sophie Hutton as she rides away in her wedding carriage, speaks more about loss and generosity of spirit than any monologue or dialogue ever could.<br /><br />The series thus contains nearly all the treasures of the book but also its only failing.

A glance from Miss Matty, now an ancient spinster whose own dreams of marriage turned to dust decades earlier, at the young and beautiful Sophie Hutton as she rides away in her wedding carriage, speaks more about loss and generosity of spirit than any monologue or dialogue ever could.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|This is Michael's \\"Dangerous\\" Tour that reached 3.5 MILLION fans.  It had the highest HBO TV ratings in history, & won the Cable Ace Award.  This \\"IS IT\\" until someone finally puts together and releases Michael's BAD Tour & HISTORY Tours on DVD for all of us to enjoy.  His unequaled talent & commanding performance on stage was truly a gift.  This is a must have for those of us who never got to see him perform live.  It is Incredible.  Now that the King of Pop & THE Greatest Entertainer of our Time is gone this is priceless...<br /><br />You will NOT regret it.
0141187379|4.0|George Orwell was not like most British journalists nowadays who faff about in London pontificating on events they have no real experience of. He summarised the idealism of many young people in response to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. They knew it could be a vital test of history (they didn't know what full horrors were to come in WWII), and were attracted by the communual life of the militias fighting for the Spanish Republicans against Franco.<br /><br />Orwell's account captures much of the boredom, interspersed with dynamic fear of war. He hangs around Barcelona watching the effect of the turning tide of Fascist advance on that city, and describes the conditions of the front with his renowned eye for the right details - eating food out of the same pan you have washed in, the feeling of dying when you have just been shot but don't know the extent of the damage. Orwell's life brings to mind that line from Julius Caesar: Cowards die a thousand times before their deaths, the valiant never taste of death but once. Orwell's bravery is very apparent from his narrative.<br /><br />His political ear is acute, and a detailed appendix spells out the full ideological complexities of the parties fighting in the Civil War.<br /><br />Orwell was a brave, hardy intellectual who put his money where his mouth is. Makes the likes of Christopher Hitchens - he rages about Islamism, Iraq etc. but only goes to the places a couple of times a year knowing fine well he wouldn't last 5 minutes as a fighter - seem like they are all mouth and no trousers.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I don't want to give away any of the plot...This movie is an adult fairy tale.  If you like this kind of theme, you will like this movie.  I thought it was okay.  The movie entertained me & had an original plot.  Brad Pitt was pretty good - I only comment on him because I don't usually like him - but he pulled it together for this role. Cate Blanchett is always good...
B002M4ZH8C|4.0|Angry about the bankers going bust? Ferguson starts from this premise to educate the reader into the history behind how international finance got to its current position. Beginning with loan tablets in ancient Mesopotamia, Ferguson traces the origins of government lending, the stock market, the bond market, the mysteries of quants, and a fascinating final chapter on how China and America have up to now been in a symbiotic relationsip with Chinese goods funding American avarice, but this may not be for much longer.<br /><br />Ferguson's books have been getting bigger and more ambitious the more famous as he has become. With this comes a necessary amount of reductive argument, lurching from Glasgow loan sharks, to Potosi silver mines, to the reckless Scotsman John Law who set up a French state bank in the 18th Century which ended up ruining its investors. This is probably because, like all Ferguson's recent books, it is a TV tie in.<br /><br />Ferguson is also very much in favour of globalisation and international finance. He plugs the book in the introduction as a teaching tool for those who are sceptical or shaky of the systems that drive money around the world. Wise up, or be a loser is his essential message. This book was finished just before the great bank collapse, and as a result doesn't have much to say on the current crisis.<br /><br />This kind of chest thumping history is clearly very lucrative for Ferguson, but after his brilliant early books on the Rothschilds and the First World War, one can't help thinking with his mid career media don posing, he has acted a bit like the hedge fund managers such as Ken Griffin he idolises in this book who gained great wealth at the expense of something more solid, decent and lasting.
B00284BMBM|5.0|I liked Daughtry's first album a lot, but Leave This Town allows you to hear just how good this band is. Every song has been written with meaning and you can tell Chris and guys have put everything they have into making an truly great record. It's so much deeper than their previous album and the southern rock Daughtry really shines through. I'm a fan for life!
B001HIJYR4|5.0|This is another thrill binding action film staring Angelina Joli.  She recruits another special agent that kills for the betterment of society.  A hit is ordered but not the one Angelina believes.  The unexpected twist is Angelina and her company is targeted for elimination.  Super addition to any movie collection.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Frankly, I do not understand the Joy Division fanboys. Yes, Interpol has some similarities to Ian Curtis' outfit of nearly three decades ago. Why is that considered to be a fault? Isn't it great that some modern bands (including the boys at Interpol Bloc Party, and Editors) are trying to emulate the brilliance of Joy Division rather than become another band tailoring their musical prowess towards prepubescent girls? I think Ian Curtis would be flattered to see the impact his band had on music. If you really cannot let go of the past, why are you buying new music at all? You obviously purchased this record because you wanted to experience what you loved about the dark sound of JD again, but  for some reason you are complaining because they DO indeed radiate a similar vibe.    Now then, to the album. The first thing you should know is that this album is a grower--very much so, in fact. I was left lukewarm after the first listen, so don't be alarmed if that happens to you. Interpol's music has real depth and it is difficult to appreciate all the layers the first time around. Give it at least 3-5 spins before deciding if it works for you. I would recommend you use decent headphones to catch all the subtleties of the record, since a lot of them are lost on a stereo system.    Also, keep in mind that the album works best as a total experience--from Untitled to Leif Erickson, the album is meant to be listened to as a complete work. While individual songs can feel a little incomplete at times, this is truly an instance of the whole being more than the sum of its parts.    Lastly, do yourself a favor and take this for a walk at night--just you and the album, no distractions. I found that this creates an unparalleled atmosphere and accentuates the album's dark brilliance beautifully.
B001F7MSFM|5.0|This is a good science fiction film for the entire family.  Hellboy is rebellious and fights a battle between good and evil.  He is married to Liz and takes her needs for granted.  Abe finds out Liz is pregnant and that is what saves Hellboy in the end when he is mortally wounded.  Liz is hown that Hellboy will destroy mankind and has to decide if she wants him to live despite what she is shown.  Telling Hellboy she is pregnant gives him the strength and extra will to live.  I would rate this film with two thumbs up.

B000PMGS8G|4.0|This was great!!!!  I used to watch this movie as a kid, and it was hysterical to see it again now as an adult. Now I have my 4 and 2 year old kids into it!!! Quality was fine (it's an old movie anyway so you can't expect much from special effects).

B00012BSHG|5.0|We're very pleased with this pool.  Durable, colorful, and fun.  The \\"padded\\" bottom makes it easier for my kids to run and jump into the pool without anybody getting hurt.  Deep enough for the big kids, but not too much so for the little ones.  I can even sit in it and cool off with my 2 girls and my baby - there's room for everyone.  The BEST feature is probably the drain on the bottom of the pool.  It's too heavy to move around when filled up, but simply pull the drain at the bottom when you're done and the pool empties quickly on its own.  We highly recommend it!
B001FB4VZS|4.0|Another reviewer has vented on the packaging of this season.<br />I love this show! Season 8 was a breath of fresh air. I bought it the night it came out but....had to swap it out twice due to discs being scratched and holders broken. [...]<br />Get this season, just check it before you leave the store.

0345472322|5.0|This book is a very interesting theory on the differences in people and the way they think. We are all influenced by the people closest to us and this book provides some insight into why our mindset causes us to see things differently.
B0019LY5I2|3.0|First I must confess I do not know much about Hasbro's \\"G. I. Joe\\" franchise. I have not seen the TV shows. I have not read the comics either. I just went to see \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" as pure entertainment, a summer season blockbuster film helmed by the director of \\"The Mummy\\" and \\"Van Helsing.\\" Those who have seen these moderately entertaining films know what they will see in theater - exotic locations, beautiful girls and lots of computer-rendered actions.    But there is one thing that \\"G.I. Joe\\" doesn't have - a hero you can relate to. Apparently we are supposed to follow the story of Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans), two US soldiers who recently joined the G.I. Joe team led by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid) after they were attacked by the \\"Baroness\\" (Sienna Miller), during their mission to transport a nanotechnology-based weapon. Duke happens to know the identity of the Baroness. Then a flashback starts. More than once.     There are another story about ninja-like warriors, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow (and another flashback), and a secret about Arnold Vosloo's character, plus one Scotsman who lived in the 17th century and his descendant. The 2-hour film is pretty fast-paced, but there are so many things going on and few of them are really interesting.    I like Stephen Sommers' films. I like \\"The Mummy\\" and, to a lesser degree, \\"Van Helsing.\\" But let's face it. Channing Tatum is no Hugh Jackman. And perhaps no Brendan Fraser either. Also, \\"Joe\\" really needs Kate Beckinsale, too.    The greatest part of the film is, of course, Ray Park as Snake Eyes. Even if you don't see his face, he never disappoints. Some action sequences in Paris (especially the stunts) are wonderful, but still the special effects are average at best.    \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" is fairly entertaining. However, when the end credits roll, we realize the whole story about G.I. Joe has just begun. But frankly I am not sure the audiences are still interested in the fate of the characters, most of whom are not very interesting. \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" looks like a costly trailer of a sequel you may or may not see in the future.
B0000AC8LL|5.0|This is a great presentation of the US entry intry into WW II.  The special effects aare exceptional.  I have a collection of WW II films and many of the action scenes are taken from this movie.  The origianl footag is put into the finished product with expertise and taste.  I think every high school student shoudl see this to help us from forgetting the trauma of Dcember 7, 1941.

B00144VBBS|1.0|My wife loves this guy and this album.  When she drives, which is hardly ever, I am forced to listen to this.  I rather be water tortured at Guantanamo then listen to country.  Hey its just my opinion so don't hate me for it.  I have listened to this CD enough times to qualify me for a review.
1401917186|5.0|I contantly refer to this book and talk about it, and recommend it to my friends.  It has struck a chord with me, and all of the other lightworkers I know.    I'm looking forward to more updates on the book as newer realms are uncovered.
B000O77RLE|4.0|I watched Flags of Our Fathers first before watching \\"Letters..\\".  It was enlightening to see and try to understand the mentality of the Japanese military men as individuals and how they perceived the fight for Iwo Jima. Kudos to Clint Eastwood for putting out these two fine films.  Very enjoyable.

B000O77QD8|4.0|The movie helped personalize the fight of the generation that went before me.  My father was a career man in the army and fought in WWII and the Korean War.  Clint Eastwood did a wonderful thing by making this movie and the companion film, Letters from Iwo Jima.  Both entertaining, informative, and insightful.
076790592X|5.0|This was a great book. I had to read it for english and once I started reading it, I couldn't stop. It was funny, sad and inspiring. I would recommend it to anyone. It's an easy read. I hope you enjoy!

B000ULQV0W|5.0|I saw the movie and just fell in love with it. The music went great with the film and decided to buy the cd. Eddie Vedder is just simple great! I play this in my classroom all of the time. I even have high school students asking me about the cd. The lyrics, the melodies....just fantastic. Thanks Eddie!!!
B0015KO52S|5.0|I'm a huge White Stripes fan and I pursued this album because it falls within the genre of music that I listen to. I really liked the album, but not because I liked the White Stripes, if that makes any sense. The two bands produce two way different sounds. The White Stripes' sound is very simple basic music, which I like whereas the Raconteurs' music has a lot more going on in it. Regardless of any other musical affiliations of the members with any bands, I think \\"Consolers of the Lonely\\" is a pretty good rock album. If you've listened to their first album \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\", I would compare them by saying that this new album is less volatile in sound from song-to-song and, in my opinion, an improvement in the sometimes boring, slow drawl of music that is \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\".
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Smallville is One of my Favorite show on TV. I love the characters and more. I bought the Season 8 from Hastings on Tuesday night - the day it came out, and I was very excited to start watching it. Keep making them, I will keep buying them.
0553284347|5.0|I am an abuse suvivor who is just starting on my journey toward emotional health. This book helped me to understand that my feelings and actions are not abnormal for someone from my background. I wish that my father could read this book so he could understand why I acted the way I did as a child. However, the title would make him very defensive, so he would not read it. This book also helped me to see the role both parents played in the family's disfunction. It helped me to quit protecting the \\"passive abuser\\". I was so impressed with this book that I shared it with my therapist. ** This book should not be used as the only source for recovery, but as a tool to be used in conjunction with therapy.** I would highly recommend it not only for abuse survivors, but for toxic parents who are seeking to understand and change.
0307454541|5.0|I like all kinds of genres, and this book brought out the best in a lot of them.  It is definitely an adult novel with all the sex, violence, and swearing.  I think they didn't overabuse any of those three, however, and the book was written quite well.  There doesn't seem to be too many sarcastic remarks lost in the translation; it all flows very well and the characters become very likeable.  I'm not sure if that is the work of the original author or of the translator but either way this book is humorous an becomes more and more action-packed towards the end.  I highly recommend this book - also I am halfway through the second in the series and that one is even better than this so far, so if you are intimidated by a trilogy I encourage you to read on because they are definitely worth taking the time to read.
B00004UFYU|5.0|This is amazingly good music.  There is nothing I know of to compare it to--kind of a cross between Gregorian chants and rock.  I'll probably buy a few more of their CDs.  It would be cool to know more about the artists, but the liner notes didn't give me any hints.  Regardless, I recommend it.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|I purchased one of these mixers for some remote video recording (using the mixer for the audio portion, obviously) recently and found it to be a good on-site mixer, with only a few draw backs. I had set it up with 4 microphones (2 mono XLR Behringer dynamic and 1 mono 1/4\\" TS  dynamnic behringer, and 1 mono 1/4\\" TS dynamic Philips) set up around the subject. I am not sure if it was the mixing of pre-amped with non-amped inputs, the placement of the mics, or the mics themselves, but the sound came out a bit \\"tinny.\\" I suspect the mics were the problem, so I am planning on buying 4 new Behringer condenser mics (2 c-4 AND 2 c-2).     The main problem I had with the mixer - which could be attributed to the mixer - was the number of pre-amps and XLR inputs. The 802 would be nice for a small, close-in production, but I would hessitate using it in a band, where multiple inputs are desirable. To that end I plan on purchasing one of the 1204 units and using this as a back-up mixer.     While the mixers are nicely portable, they would be useless in an outdoor operation, where battery power would be required.     On the whole, the 802 is a nice little unit, and very useful to the home/small studio enthusiast.
0394800389|4.0|This is a clever book full of tongue twisters, which can be enjoyed as an easy reader or as a read-aloud.  The fox plies his friend Mr. Knox with tongue twisters (each accompanied by a funny illustrated scene) and Knox refuses to try them, but in the end Mr. Knox bests the fox at his own game.  Children will enjoy playing with these silly words and silly scenes, all of which are defined by the easy reader's limited vocabulary.  It's lots of fun, and this kind of wordplay may help open the mind to an appreciation of true poetry.

B0029LHW4A|5.0|If you take the time to read some of the reviews online by various newspapers and publications you'll find that Jet are far from being \\"critics darlings\\". For some reason they are an easy target for critics. Not sure why but maybe it has something to do with their lyrics and/or subject matter not being particularily deep. Listen, these guys are no nonsense, old-school (w/ a modern twist), upbeat, fun rockers. They're not concerned w/ bringing listeners down (or themselves for that matter) or weighing heavenly on anyones mind. They just keep it simple, fun and rocking all throughout this new release. Even w/ the new things they've added, possibly to lighten things up a bit from their previous release \\"Shine On\\", they still have that old Jet attitude intact. All I know is when I crank this album in my car, it makes me feel good all over. I feel like I could take on the world. Isn't that what Rock 'N Roll is all about?!!!    At 40-years-old, I have finally come to terms w/ this fact: Critics SUCK!!!!! If you love Rock 'N Roll, what it truly stands for and the pure fun of it, I don't know how you don't like this album. I'm starting to wonder what kind of music these critics listen to.    Anyway, enough on that. Let's get to the subject at hand. The songs!!!    I heard \\"K.I.A\\" a couple of months back via the band's web site and pretty much took to it right away. Typical Jet hooks and attitude. \\"Beat on Repeat\\" is presently \\"on repeat\\" in my brain w/ it's instant hook and danceability. \\"She's a Genius\\" has one of the coolest little guitar riffs I have heard in years and is pure Jet fun. Take a look at their recent Late Show With David Letterman performance via their web site and you'll see what I mean. \\"17\\" is a bit different for them and quite interesting because of that fact, \\"Goodbye Hollywood\\" is a telling song about the trappings of the entertainment industry, \\"Walk\\" rock's w/ the old Jet swagger, and \\"Let Me Out\\" is almost a continuation of \\"Goodbye Hollywood\\" in that it revisits the same subject matter of that track. If \\"Start The Show\\" doesn't get your blood boiling than I don't know what will and finally, \\"Grudge\\" ends things on a nice note w/ it's low-key positive love song approach.    I can say with all honesty that I think this is Jet's best album yet. More complete than the other two and it never loses it's energy. Never gets boring at any point.    [...]
B000002MG0|2.0|This review applies to the LP (vinyl) album:    $10 seemed like a decent deal for this classic on vinyl. When I opened the record up it looked like it had some scuff marks on it, as if it wasn't handled right when it was stored. I started playing it and it sounded fine. I'm no audiophile but it had a nice lush sound. When I flipped it over and got to Nightswimming, it had a weird echoey distortion, more in the piano than the vocals.     Had to return it based on that. Great album, but buyer beware on the vinyl.
B000H305U0|5.0|His first solo album, \\"Justified\\", met much success and his follow-up album, \\"Futuresex/Lovesounds\\" is even better, with Timberlake feeling his oats and ditching his nice guy persona for a more sensual, adult groove.  He still drives the girls crazy and has built an even more solid fan base after numerous appearances on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" where, with help from Andy Samberg, he has shown the world he has a great sense of humor, which has earned him more credibility among the young males of the demographic to which he caters.<br /><br />With help, as always, from Timbaland, and with such guest stars as Three Six Mafia and T.I., Timberlake brings a fine production of rockin' beats, lyrics about sex and heartbreak and a solid album of which most is great material with very little filler.  This is one of those few compilations that comes along that has a lot of singles released and no matter how many times they are played ad nauseum on the radio, they are still enjoyable to listen to on your own time.<br /><br />Below is a track-by-track description with a numeric rating on a scale of one to ten.<br /><br />Track 1:  FutureSex/LoveSound--(8)--a good, heavy-hitting track to start the album off with.  Easily danceable, definitely sensual, this showcases Timberlake's new sound, his new persona.  It's fresh, it's rich and you'll want to dance right along with it.<br /><br />Track 2: SexyBack--(8)--the first single from the album.  Still has staying power, despite being radio-raped.  Allowed the public a sneak peek at the sensuality that Timberlake had newly embraced and let run through all of the tracks on this album.<br /><br />Track 3: Sexy Ladies--(8)--another track with a good beat that is similar to the beat used in \\"Futuresex/Lovesound\\".  It's hard to stop yourself from dancing while driving when this is playing in the car.<br /><br />Track 4: My Love--(7)--an upbeat danceable love song from Timberlake to his lady love.  This has also achieved a lot of radioplay but it still just as good after repeat listens.  T.I. lends a hand with this track and, just as with the rest of them, we hear a lot of Timbaland on this track as well.<br /><br />Track 5: LoveStoned/I Think She Knows--(8)--A track to follow in the 'N Sync steps of falling for a girl that he meets in a club.  Here, Timberlake starts off with yet another strong, danceable track and leads into one of the many over-a-minute-long interludes he uses on this album.<br /><br />Track 6: What Goes Around (Comes Around)--(10)--Nice and long with some great beats about a man who's been wronged by his cheating lover who is going to get her just desserts.<br /><br />Track 7: Chop Me Up--(10)--Another incredible song to follow up the previous incredible song.  The beat is amazing, the Three Six Mafia raps are put together very well and this is easily one of the most solid tracks on the album.  You will be blasting this when it comes on.<br /><br />Track 8: Damn Girl--(5)--This track is one of the least liked on the album.  It doesn't have the same flow and it doesn't feel like it's put together as tightly.<br /><br />Track 9: Summer Love--(9)--This is a great song to crank up in the car on a hot summer night while you're cruising along the winding roads of the neighborhood.  Great beats once again!<br /><br />Track 10: Until The End Of Time--(6)--this song sounds like it could have come off of any one of Prince's albums, since it features his signature beat.  One of the more down-tempo songs on the album, it still holds its own as a ballad.  The album version does not feature Beyonce, as the radio version had.<br /><br />Track 11: Losing My Way--(7)--a good slow jam about people who need someone to hear their plight because lately, life hasn't been going so well for them.<br /><br />Track 12: (Another Song) All Over Again--(5)--another forgettable track along the same lines as \\"Damn Girl\\".  This is another ballad on the album but not very solid.I. lends a hand with this track and, just as with the rest of them, we hear a lot of Timbaland on this track as well.    Track 5: LoveStoned/I Think She Knows--(8)--A track to follow in the 'N Sync steps of falling for a girl that he meets in a club.  Here, Timberlake starts off with yet another strong, danceable track and leads into one of the many over-a-minute-long interludes he uses on this album.

Track 9: Summer Love--(9)--This is a great song to crank up in the car on a hot summer night while you're cruising along the winding roads of the neighborhood.  Great beats once again!    Track 10: Until The End Of Time--(6)--this song sounds like it could have come off of any one of Prince's albums, since it features his signature beat.  One of the more down-tempo songs on the album, it still holds its own as a ballad.  The album version does not feature Beyonce, as the radio version had.    Track 11: Losing My Way--(7)--a good slow jam about people who need someone to hear their plight because lately, life hasn't been going so well for them.    Track 12: (Another Song) All Over Again--(5)--another forgettable track along the same lines as \\"Damn Girl\\".  This is another ballad on the album but not very solid.
B002HHBBYI|5.0|JET is my favorite band, and this is by far their best album so far. It was well worth the wait, all the songs are fantastic. The only problem I see is that the bonus track 'One Hipster One Bullit' is almost exactly the same as 'Snap Your Fingers' from Shine On, just with a few different words. But it is still their best work yet!
1416914307|5.0|This is alittle slow at first and you expect a vampire novel, but it is about shadow hunters. It is very enjoyable and is very vivid storytelling. It has alot more mythical creatures like demons, warlocks, and gods. I loved the surroundings that were described, especially in the last book city of glass. I was alittle upset at the end cause it was left dangling. I think it could continue... I really enjoyed reading it after the first book I had to run out and buy the next two. definately worth reading.
B000NY133G|1.0|I'll start by saying that there's a few nuggets of wisdom, pearls of truth, buried deep down inside this book. Unfortunately, they are buried inside horse dung.<br />I disagree VERY VERY VERY strongly with some of the main principles of this so-called secret to life.<br />The so called Law of Attraction is what one might term a \\"New Age Philosophy\\" or theory. It suggests that like attracts like. And in many cases, it will. Happy people tend to find themselves surrounded by happy people. But she takes this PRINCIPLE and then states that it i an infallible natural law, just as specific and universal as gravity. Can I get the judges' ruling on this one? It is grossly oversimplified (to the point of losing all meaning and value), and idolized.<br />The author maintains that the only thing you need to know in life is basically \\"Think happy!\\" (insert smiley faces and dot your i's with hearts please)<br />The author also actually EXPLICITLY states that you don't need to DO anything. Just think happy, and the universe will magically reorder itself to cater to your whims.<br />The author maintains that the key to happiness is getting what you want. She says nothing about getting what you need. And you know, there's two kinds of happiness. Conditional and unconditional. She seems unaware that one can be happy for no reason, and if you can do that, suddenly, you don't feel like you need a million bucks or a new car to be happy.<br />Nope, nope... according to this author, you need the money, the car, the perfect spouse, etc, to be happy. Gee... guess I have this whole happiness thing all wrong. I'm happy because I choose to be. What the heck is wrong with me, huh?<br />The author offers abolutely no reference or research. She spends the first chapter talking about researching this so called secret back for hundreds of years, then gives us NONE of her source material. I smell a rodent...<br />Also, she keeps throwing the buzzwords \\"scientifically proven\\" and \\"quantum physics tell us\\" out there. I actually happen to be a student of the scientific method, and an amateur quantum physics enthusiast. She clearly knows absolutely nothing about either. But you see, most people don't know much about them either. So by throwing those magic words out, she suddenly appears to have authority.<br />Some of her premises are mutually exclusive.<br />For example:<br />You cannot harm others with your thoughts. Only yourself. But ANY bad thoughts WILL hurt you.<br />Any bad event in your life is because you thought it into existence.<br />So...........<br />A plane crashes in upstate new york, kills all the crew, all the passengers, AND the people in the house it hit (reality check, I do not remember if there was anyone in the house or not). So, did every single one of these people will their own fiery death into existence? Because whether it was all or just one, they ALSO willed dozens of OTHER fiery deaths into existence. Thoughts can't hurt others, only you? What? But you thought that plane crash into existence...<br />At best, this book is a total crock, born of a very simple and VERY illusioned mind. At worst, she is preying on those who do not know any better, who are desperately seeking some sort of guidance, and will buy her book to get it. And her movie. And her other book... And does she offer seminars that I can pay to go to? How much wealth has she accumulated by offering the fountain of youth?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Positive thinking is essential to positive living. But it is NOT some great cosmic secret that Einstein and Da Vinci hid away from the rest of the world. And thought without action is meaningless. I especially loved the chapter on weight loss.<br />Yes, it is possible to eat whatever quantity of junk food you want and lose weight. If you back it up with hard work. But she insists that food doesn't make you fat. Thought makes you fat. And if you think thin, you can eat pizza and ice cream on your couch ALL DAY LONG and shedpounds.<br /><br />A friend recommended this book to me, and I think I need to introduce that friend to some real life changing philosophy. Try Dan Millman. Anything he wrote is better than this. For those who find this book inspiring, I suggest starting with his children's books. They might be on your level.introduce that friend to some real life changing philosophy. Try Dan Millman. Anything he wrote is better than this.

B001GCUO4I|5.0|The 4th, and what is billed as the final \\"Final Destination\\" flick, reaches a new level with its fantastic 3D presentation.  The storyline is the same; the plot is the same; the \\"out-of-your-seat\\" suspense is the same; but when you add 3D to the success of the three previous classics, this one is a total winner.  If, in fact, this destination is now final, I think a 4-movie marathon is in order...with the first three being upgraded to 3D!  If you have not been a stout follower of this series, the 3D version will totally blow you away (no pun intended).  Director David Ellis has shared directorship with James Wong since 2000, when the first (and best) film hit the screens.  Wong was the director of 1 and 3, Ellis of 2 and 4.  If asked which is the better director in this supporting role, I would have to stick with Wong.  There's nothing Wong with Wong...everything is right!     While watching this film in the theatre this afternoon, a mom brought her younger children (I'm guessing 8 and 10 years old).  DON'T BRING THE KIDS!  This is much too intense for them...especially in 3D!!!  The kids kept asking their mom if they could leave...but she just told them to shut up and sit down.  Don't make that mistake.  This film will be highly traumatic to kids...and adults if they are not accustomed to a gruesome gorefest like this (and all 4 destinations).      I give this final edition 5 stars because of the 3D element.  Don't wait to see it on DVD.  If you do not see this on the BIG screen...in 3D...\\"The Final Destination\\" will simply be viewed as part 4.  You need the glasses and the popcorn in surround sound.
0316017922|1.0|What is it?  Gladwell defined outliers that are people that become successful due to their environment and surroundings. Or put it simply, luck. To his credit, his three books are selling well on Amazon, Outliers #15, Tipping Point #55, and Blink #92.  His writing is very good. His use of examples bode well with psychologist, economist, social scientist, but not with engineers, tech experts, or entrepreneurs.<br /><br />Gladwell said that Bill Gates got into the computer environment in high school, way before his peers. Gates and Paul Allen spent thousands of hours to make it successful. Good theory, but if anyone does the CASE study on Microsoft, it is not so. Thousands of high school kids have spent time doing exactly what Gates did.  The main reason for Gates success, was the development of MS-DOS, and with Gates father (a lawyer) help, signed a contract with IBM.  MS-DOS was bundled with IBM PC as one selling package. Bill got one billion shares. That is how he became a billionaire.<br /><br />Gladwell said Asian students with good math skills, then moved up to start firms in Silicon Valley.  I guess he meant the Chinese and Indians.  The reasons for starting firms, are many.  They got venture $, they did not want to be a tech manager, and they saw a niche in the market place.  CEOs of the successful tech firms in the Silicon Valley, were not Asian math wiz.  Jerry Yang Yahoo is one of the few exceptions.<br /><br />Gladwell said the Jewish lawyers did litigation and takeover work because the main stream law firms would not hire them or would not do this type of work. This is true to some degree. But the theory why they are successful, is not clear.  Many Jewish lawyers in NYC, worked in banking, insurance, hedge fund, private equity, Fortune 500 firms, are successful. It is not because they work on cases that nobody wants, is because they work hard, and they know what they are doing.  They are the best in their respective legal fields.<br /><br />If one defines outliers as rich and successful, then any billionaire will fit this description.  Gladwell theory needs to be completely rewritten. Most of them on Forbes 500 list, got there due to hard work, market niche, team management, international trade, vision leadership, ethics and excellent execution.  I guess they are all outliers.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book because his theory is totally flawed.  I gave one star because it is a catchy title to sell his book.outliers as rich and successful, then any billionaire will fit this description.  Gladwell theory needs to be completely rewritten.

B000QUCNOK|4.0|A well-crafted delivery of sight and sounds, this film almost smells as intriguing as it looks.  I initially picked up the book \\"Perfume\\" in our condo's laundry room book shelf and read it only b/c I was thoroughly bored. I was completely enthralled by the story and taken by the literary genius behind the tale and its originality.  So when I found that a movie version of the story was out, with Dustin Hoffman, needless to say, I was anxious to see if the film could live up to the vividness and depth of the book. THe film does not disappoint.  It's a good condensation of the story; and although no film version could ever hope to plum the depth's of Grunuiu's psyche so well as the book, the imagery and musical backdrop adequately convey the character's oddities and social deficiencies(to put it mildly). Although not nearly as moving or disturbing as the book, the film nevertheless satisfies.

0439023483|5.0|The less said about this fabulous, futuristic sci-fi story, the better. The super short, non-spoiler story is this: it's about a 16 year-old girl named Katniss that participates in the Hunger Games, a fight to the death between two persons (one male, one female) from each of the 12 \\"divisions\\" that make up a country called Panem, formerly the United States. The losers, as chosen \\"lottery\\" style, are sent to the Capitol, fattened up, trained, and otherwise prepared for the fight of their lives. Suzanne Collins, author of the Gregor the Overlander series, did everything right in her writing. With its faced-pace style, charismatic characters, clever creatures, imaginative descriptions, and a wee bit of romance, the only thing to complain about is the wait for the next installment. Fortunately for fans, the second in the series, Catching Fire, is due out at the start of September - yay!<br /><br />Other good reads for YAs: The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, Twilight by Stephenie Meyer, and The Giver by Lois Lowery.
B002EWD08Q|4.0|Into a new studio in the desert after 2 years, the AMs team with Josh Homme (Queens of the Stone Age) in the producers chair to deliver another great album, possibly their best to date.  The lyric style and subjects remain the same but the delivery and musical envelope have matured and expanded adding weight and a welcome breath of unpredictability.  Judging by the quality of the song writing, the AMs could've easily tossed off another record like their debut or FWN, but instead they take more of a \\"been there done that\\" approach and explore other influences and moods to expand their sound.  The result is unmistakably AMs, but indeed the Hommes' influence is heard and it works very well.  The album is a fantastic grower that over time reveals judicious sonic layering, some of their strongest melodies, interesting and less typical beats, and overall more ambitious song execution.  Simultaneously haunting and jubilant the AMs have hit their third album on the head; a challenge always more difficult after avoiding the sophomore slump, which of course they did with flying colors.
0792839749|5.0|A movie like this does not have to be \\"special edition\\" to be special. This is one of the best all-around movies ever made.    To me, this movie is like two movies in one (perhaps that is why it has an old-fashioned intermission).    Pay close enough attention to the credits and will you will realize why this movie has a James Bond quality to it.    The musical scores in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang are fabulous.    The driving scenes while the actors sing \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" make you feel like you are five years old and going for a Sunday drive in a 1931 Chevy with running boards and a rumble seat - only way better!    Dick Van Dyke at the pinnacle of his talents.    Sally Ann Howes is wonderful.    Lionel Jeffries is superb (POSH)!    Benny Hill is in this movie and his famous funny stuff was not even needed!    Fun for the whole family. Simply a fantastic movie.

B001UV4XU6|3.0|Here's the basic premise for your typical Hollywood romantic-comedy:<br /><br /> 1.) Boy meets girl<br /><br /> 2.) We see how different boy and girl are and how much they hate each other (OMG no way they end up together!)<br /><br /> 3.) Boy & girl have lighthearted/flirtatious moment, then quickly pretend like nothing happened (\\"Uh, I should  go...\\")<br /><br /> 4.) Boy/girl talks to quirky best friend about maybe-sort of-kinda liking said boy or girl (\\"I think I kinda like (name)\\")<br /><br /> 5.) Quirky best friend gives incredibly insightful advice on romance/relationships and tells them what to do<br /><br /> 6.) Boy/girl confesses their love to the other<br /><br /> 7.) Boy/girl says how it will never work (\\"We're just too different!\\")<br /><br /> 8.) Boy/girl runs outside into rain, boy/girl runs out to catch them<br /><br /> 9.) Boy and girl argue again for short time, then quickly stop and share passionate kiss<br /><br />10.) Flash to 1 year later at their wedding<br /><br />11.) (Cue current top-40 pop song)<br /><br />12.) The End<br /><br />...okay, maybe not all Hollywood rom-coms have this exact formula, but 90% of the one that have come out recently are so formulaic and predictable it' almost laughable. It seems like all you need to make a romantic comedy nowadays are two good looking B-list celebs and half decent script with a couple of decent jokes. This is why I left the theatre confused and conflicted in my opinion of (500) Days of Summer. There were moments in the film of sheer brilliance and originality, and others that seemed completely tacky and recycled.<br /><br />  The film follows Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) on a desperate chase for love with a girl named Summer (Zooey Deschanel). The only problem is that she doesn't believe in love, let alone the boyfriend/girlfriend label. The advertising for this film preached about how this was not a love story, but a story about love, which is true, and is one of things that I liked about this film. Not all the people we think we love and seem perfect for us are perfect for us. The film deconstructs this and examines why we fall in love with who we do, what we're really chasing after and why relationships sometimes fail.<br /><br />  The film jumps around through the 500 days he spends with Summer and shows us the moments of pure joy and contentment that being in love can give you, as well as the moments of shear frustration and uncertainty that come with it.  For the most part, it is done in an honest and heartfelt way. An example of this is an incredibly clever scene towards the middle of the film where we see a split screen of Tom going to meet Summer for a party at her house. One side shows expectation and the other side shows what really happens. It is a completely original, honest and somewhat tender scene that does a great job of showing how Tom is really chasing after the idea of love, not Summer, herself. He is in love with the idea of the cute and quirky girl who likes the same little things he does. To put it how Woody Allen did in Manhattan, he romanticizes it.<br /><br />  One thing you usually don't see in these romance films is showing it from the male's perspective. The point of this is to make us empathize with the male character, Tom, and be frustrated and annoyed with the female character, Summer. While there were times I could relate to Tom and see why he would be mad at Summer, I couldn't help but just be incredibly annoyed with him the rest of the time. When it comes to dealing with her, he is selfish, annoying and gets upset over the littlest things. The only way he can realize how childish and stupid he is being is during the ridiculously cheesy scenes with his quirky and intellectual (see above) kid sister who tells him that he is obsessing over Summer because she just likes the same stupid little things that he does (also, did anyone notice the elevator scene where he finds out she likes The Smiths was a complete rip-off of Garden State?). He is in love with what she is, not with who she is, and this ultimately proves to be the downfall of their relationship.<br /><br />  It has clich&eacute; scenes that will make you roll your eyes and genuinely charming ones where you can't help but smile. Despite any of its faults, where the film succeeds is in its believable, albeit occasionally annoying characters, witty script, and its off-beat take on relationships and love.

B000TXNDUW|5.0|Jean-Luc Godard has been credited with revitalizing cinema in the early 60's with his interesting and unique style of filmmaking, a style that has bleed over into even modern cinema and continues to influence and inspire.  To say that Jean-Luc Godard is one of the greatest directors of all time (in company with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Ingmar Bergman) is perhaps too simple.  The fact remains that Godard isn't simply one of the best, he's one of the most important.  `A Bout de Souffle' (better known as `Breathless') is a sublime example of why he is so important.  With his debut feature film he stunned audiences and critics alike by breathing a breath of fresh air into cinema and creating something new and intriguing and completely entertaining.<br /><br />`A Bout de Souffle' is one of those films you have to be wary about `over-praising' because once you `get' it you totally fall head over heals for it, but until you `get' it you may find yourself baffled at all the praise.  That was me upon my initial viewing.  I was about halfway into the film and I was stumped as to why this movie was so well loved.  Sure, it was stylistically exuberating and blatantly original in construction, but as far as being a great `movie', well, I just wasn't `feeling' it in that way.  The third act though is a huge wallop to the viewer and completely changed my thinking on the entire film.  In fact, upon my second viewing I was able to spot things throughout the films progression that only added to my admiration for it, and now I am completely and utterly in love with the film; so much so that I consider it one of the best ever made.<br /><br />So, I don't want to raise your expectations so much that you become dumbfounded in the films first and second act.  Please, realize that my praise belongs to the film in its entirety, and entirety that cannot be fully appreciated until the third act is through.  You really need to judge the film on your second viewing, for it is only after you have put all the pieces together that you can really enjoy the film from start to finish.<br /><br />The film is part crime noir, part romantic thriller.  It centers around a thug named Michel who is on the run after killing a police officer.  He hides out in his American girlfriend's apartment.  The film sports a neurotic narrative that keeps the audience glued as Michel and Patricia (the girlfriend) go through their day as normal people in abnormal circumstances.  The performances are fresh and believable, and the dialog (a lot of which was adlibbed) feels perfect for the situation.  Godard brings a lot of his love for film into his construction of `A Bout de Souffle', a film that can be seen as an ode to the great film noirs that came before it.  What is remarkable is that, but making this film completely his own, Godard created an ode that is superior to the films he was praising.<br /><br />During a press conference with an author, Jean Seberg's character Patricia asks the author \\"what is your greatest ambition in life\\" to which he responds, after much thought, \\"to become immortal and then to die\\".  The significance of this statement is seen, not only in this film, but in the idea that art makes the artist immortal.  Godard has become immortal.  In the context of the film though, the immortality comes from love.  When one has become truly loved then they are in essence `immortal'.<br /><br />The question raised at the end of this film is, `was Michel immortal?'<br /><br />Through Godard's impressive way of telling a story within a story one really has to watch this film a few times to answer that question.  The outcome with each viewing may be different than the last, and the fact that Godard keeps the answer an ambiguity is to the films advantage.  Did Patricia really love Michel?  Was her emotional reaction to the films conclusion all just an act?  Piecing together Godard's point of view may reveal an answer you least expect, which makes this film all the more captivating.  The films production notes mention that Patricia commits the ultimate act of betrayal; but exactly what that act is, is up to the audience to decide.notes mention that Patricia commits the ultimate act of betrayal; but exactly what that act is, is up to the audience to decide.

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Filmed with 21 high definition cameras in 16x9 widescreen format in October 2007 in Rotterdam, Holland, Snakes & Arrows Live is without a doubt, one of the best ever live concert DVDs. With a total running time of three hours and forty minutes, this three-disc set is a dream come true for any Rush fan. Discs one and two feature the 27-song concert from the Netherlands. This mammoth set list features nine songs from the Snakes & Arrows album alongside classics such as `Subdivisions' and `Tom Sawyer'. From the opening notes of `Limelight' to the final moments of `YYZ', vocalist/bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart are in fine form. Consummate professionals, they make the most intricate passages look effortless. The stage is set with Geddy's Henhouse rotisserie chicken ovens as well as Alex's toy dinosaurs and Barbie dolls. What sets Snakes & Arrows Live apart from previous Rush DVDs: R30 (2005) and Rush In Rio (2003) is the myriad number of up close and personal camera angles, highlighting the prodigious musicianship and on stage interaction. In fact, watching this DVD is almost better than actually being at the show. The bonus features include the absolutely hilarious skit, What's That Smell, which was used to introduce the second set. Who knew Alex and Geddy were such comedians? Disc three - Oh, Atlanta! The Authorized Bootlegs contains four songs added for the 2008 American tour. And the term bootleg is highly misleading. A fan in the rafters didn't capture these; they're entirely pro-shot. Completing the package is a 12-page booklet. The only thing missing is interviews with the band.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|I've tried twice and still haven't been able to finish this movie...  it's that bad.    Each time I've tried I've turned it off and spent my time with much more constructive and entertaining activities, like paying my friend to stomp on my nuts until I forget the portion of the movie I endured.    Let me bring method to the madness with respect to the cast/charecters (please forgive me if I spell names incorrectly):    Angolina Jolie - By putting her in this movie the teenage males hoping to see a decent looking naked girl buy tickets.  I'll admit, I was hoping a charecter similar to Mr and Mrs Smith (a movie I thoroughly enjoyed).    Morgan Freeman - This dude hasn't made to0 many bad movies.  I can't think of one, until now.    James Mcevoy (the hero) - Any adolecent minded male with daddy/anger/control issues will like this guy's charecter.  The actor seems OK, but his charecter sucks.    All of the above were assembled to sell tickets/rentals to a movie that is TERRIBLE.  The script/plot is terrible, so bring in some decent actors and you'll lure some people into watching the movie.    I'm a guy that LOVES action movies.  Realistic, roger, not always the case.  I enjoyed the crap out of movies like: Sin City, The Punisher: War Zone, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, etc.  Realistic - not always, but entertaining and well done IMHO.    So I tried to watch Wanted as though it were and adaptation of a comic book (like Sin City, but less artsy).  If you do that... you MIGHT be able to endure the whole movie.  Problem is, it's a LAME comic book.    An example - The hero's dad is a super assassin capable of \\"spiking his adrenaline\\" allowing him to move with incredible speed.  Cool idea.  Not realistic, but I can deal as long as it's entertaining, you know?  Then he jumps through a plate glass window at the speed of a race car without so much as a scratch.  Ummmmmmmm...  OK, maybe, stretching it, we're talking hollywood and this mistake is common...  Then - while in flight - the shooting starts.  The super assassin is capable of \\"curving bullets.\\"  He proceeds to dispatch several opposing assassins with a compensated Beretta pistol and an OLD SCHOOL BLACK POWDER PISTOL.  Why, in the name of god, would a dude that can jump through a plate glass window at MACH 2 without physical damage and curve 9mm bullets around 90 degree corners need a FLINT LOCK?  Lame.  Then, all of the sudden, gravity kicks in and the super assassins trajectory takes him into yet another plate glass window just below the roof where his would-be killers are now bleeding.  Naturally our super assassin appears on the roof top to polish of the last bad guy.  Then he gets shot in the head from what appears to be many miles away after a conversation with an enemy super assassin on a cell phone.  He must have been crashing from his adrenaline High, because it didn't occur to him to seek cover DURING the conversation.  See this scene in the movie an you'll know what I'm talking about.  We've now achieved MEGA Lame.  I'm not going to get into the timing of the conversation, the shot itself, and the bullet which would need to be traveling at the speed of light to ACTUALLY do what it did... Ok, I will because it further illustrates how lame the movie is: dude gets killed after last word in phone conversation - elaborate \\"rewind\\" scene back to the shooter - who pulls the trigger after the last word of the conversation -> guy killed at same time as trigger pull = speed of light      From here it get's lamer and lamer, until I had to stop and have my reproductive organs smashed until I came back to my senses.    You'll see a car chase where the super assassins, who are SO talented they can curve bullets, expend more ordnance than a Marine Platoon in Fallujah - and don't hit a damn thing.  Infact, they seem to hit everything but what they're aiming at.    The hero of the movie (the previously mentioned adrenaline spiking super assassin's son) goes from the mental/emotional equivilant ofa female reproductive organ to the hollywood version of a Delta Force commando (who can eventually curve bullets as well) in less than a day...    Excessive violence, excessive profanity (look I'm a military man, I have no problem with profanity - but this wasn't clever, it was SAD), rediculous action scenes where physical laws apply at the will of the writer, gun play that is inconsistent (especially when it comes to marksmanship), aaaaannnnnnddddd...  the curving bullets thing...  LAME.    Do yourself a favour.  You'll loose just as many brain cells and be more entertained by drinking a bottle of whiskey, going to a bating cage, and letting speed balls hit you in the head until you pass out.
0307454541|1.0|I bought this book becuase like other readers I was misled by all the great reviews for the book. I am kind of annoyed with myself for not reading more of the reviews. ...like other reviewers have said the book is filled with awful cliches and a million characters that have nothing to do with the main story. I kept reading because I had already invested so much time into it and I wanted to find out what happened to this missing girl... I would say skip it and maybe do a search for spoilers for the book online if you really need to know what happens in this \\"mystery\\".
0439023483|5.0|Congratulations to Ms. Collins for coming up with such a unique plot!  This is such a breath of fresh air among all the vampire and werewolf, teen drug and sex, and wizard stories that are coming out right now.  The characters are realistic and even easy to relate to.  The plot is enthralling and intense.  Even the setting was fascinating.  There's great action, a little bit of romance, lots of suspense, and serious anger towards the Capitol.  This is a page-turner that can be enjoyed by young adults and adults alike.  (Probably PG-13 for violence.)  I am excited to see what happens in the next one!

If you're a beginning programmer and would like to get into the lucrative world of Java, start with this book first!
B001EN71DQ|4.0|I recently viewed all 6 Star Wars movies and something occurred to me: they all share the same flaws; namely uneven acting and dialogue. So I can't really understand how these prequels are worse than the originals. They share the same strong points (special effects, action sequences, impressive visuals) and they share the same flaws (goofy dialogue, uneven acting). Then again, I am not a Star Wars maniac, so maybe there is something subtle I am missing. Anyway, if you want visually impressive space opera, check these movies out. Just be warned that some of the dialogue is borderline moronic. Ian McDiarmid's performance as the main villain is fun to watch.    Ivan Rorick
0375413405|5.0|Love this book!  Shame on me for tossing out my mother's original copy many years ago.  Thanks to Julie Powell and Julia Child I have a renewed interest in French food.  Some of the recipes are complex, some very simple.  The best part is the overview the reader gets from each secion.  I will never cook everything out of this book, but when I need a classic French dish, this is the book for me!
B000286RKW|5.0|I was just blown away by this film when I first saw it and have re~watched it several times since. Unlike the silly romanticization of the Godfather or the antihero nonsense of Tarantino's films, Goodfellas shows the grim reality of organized crime in all its depressing glory. The temptation to turn gangsters into romantic antiheroes is great, but Scorsese resists it and goes totally in the opposite direction, and thus accurately captures the true stroy he is trying to portray. That acting is perfect, and the oldies soundtrack fits the action beautifully. I can't recommend this highly enough.     Ivan Rorick
0061537934|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like a book about car racing but since this came highly reccommended by a trusted friend, I gave it a go.  I am an avid dog lover and also a very spiritual person (sort of goes hand in hand don't you think?).The author was extremely imaginative and skillfully wove a heartfelt, beautiful story - - one that was an easy read and difficult to put down.  I must say the ending was one that I expected - - perfect!  I have passed this book to many of my friends, all of whom feel as I do - LOVE IT!
B00009TB5G|3.0|I don't understand the adulation these movies have received from their fans. Especially the Two Towers. Lots of fun if you like endless UGLY battle footage. And mud. I really enjoyed the books as a kid, but the films just didn't do it for me.    Ivan Rorick
B00007G207|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is one of my favorite movies.  I can't even count how many times I have seen it.  I was unaware of the existence of the Directors Cut until recently.  I had to search to find it, but I did here.  I don't know that I like it better than the movie I am so familiar with, but, I can say that you MUST see this version if you are a fan of the movie.  It is SO VERY DIFFERENT!  Don't expect anything to change until the later part of the movie...it remains as we know it until towards the last half of the movie...then WOW what a difference.  In the end I think that the extra footage, a good 50 minutes, changes the impact of those last 2-3 minutes where I always cry...no matter how many times I see it.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Ugh, this is one of the worst movies I have ever suffered through. And I'm saying this as someone who loved Pulp Fiction! Watching this rancid exercise in self~indulgence is like being trapped in a car on a long road trip with a boring film nerd who just won't shut up. I have been told that a lot of this tripe is \\"intentionally bad\\", which is apparently a good thing, but nevertheless intentionally bad is still bad. It's evidently based on all the B movies Tarantino has seen, so I guess it's trash stealing from trash. Avoid unless you're the kind of person who enjoys watching someone else play video games.     Ivan Rorick

B0007VZ9DK|5.0|The only problem I have with this movie is the performances of DeNiro and Pesci. They are just too similar to their work in Goodfellas. It seems almost like some kind of encore. Other than that, excellent movie in the vein of Goodfellas and Mean Streets. Not as good as those two msterpieces but on the same level. Highly recommended.     Ivan Rorick
B001PPLIEG|1.0|I had missed this movie when it played in theaters, so when it was available at a local Redbox rental machine for $1, I was eager to see it. After watching this movie and being utterly unimpressed by it, I was curious to know what other viewers had to say about it.  So I started reading the one-star reviews here.  I didn't have to read too far to see that these people had essentially the same reaction to \\"Quantum of Solace\\" as I did.  It was a huge disappointment.  I will not repeat much of what other reviewers have already said in both an eloquent and humorous manner.  See, for instance, Francisco J. Calderon's review entitled \\"Sputum of Nonsense\\" dated April 2, 2009.  He boils the movie down to a \\"bottom ten\\" list that is both accurate and engaging, and I think he is right on target with his appraisal of the movie.    Other one-star reviewers have (correctly) pointed out that the action sequences are too fast and tend to give the viewer vertigo.  Here is where I wish to add my own two cents' worth about the movie, since Bond movies have historically been known--at least in part--for their keenly-executed action sequences.  Now I do realize that when you see a movie you may have to suspend belief to a degree, but this movie pushes the envelope entirely beyond the limits of plausibility.  I found the action sequences to be so incredibly unrealistic that they actively detracted from the movie.  (Please note:  In describing various scenes below, I cannot avoid including material that constitutes a degree of movie spoiler.  Read on at your own discretion.) For instance:    (1) About 10 or 12 minutes into the movie, Bond runs after an assassin/double agent.  The chase takes them through underground tunnels, public crowds, housing complexes, and finally a building with interior scaffolding.  The amount of \\"acrobatics\\" that each man performs--the villain to elude capture and Bond trying to catch him--would be nearly impossible even for Superman to accomplish.  The two menultimately fall down from a height through plate glass windows at the top of this building onto the scaffolding, and they end up swinging around on the scaffolding, dodging falling metal and broken glass, in an attempt to dispatch each other.  Each man would have been dead several times over from virtually any of the injuries/impacts sustained during the chase, but somehow Bond not only manages to kill his assailant, he even walks away from it.    (2) Believing he is preventing her death, Bond snatches a woman from a boat and takes her into his own boat and tries to escape.  Of course there are plenty of bad guys with lots of automatic weapons and far superior boats that chase after them, but Bond manages to conveniently outmaneuver them and dodge all the bullets.  Even though his boat crashes into the other boats several times and the steering wheel center on his boat is riddled with bullets and torn up (of course not rendering his boat useless), once again Bond manages to safely escape.    (3) Bond charters a beat-up cargo plane that he himself flies.  Naturally the bad guys are again in hot pursuit.  This time, the villains have a smaller and far more maneuverable plane that attempts to shoot them down, eventually with the help of an attack helicopter.  It goes without saying that Bond is able to overcome insuperable odds and survive, but what makes this sequence particularly ridiculous is that Bond and Camille are eventually forced to jump out of the plane--with only one parachute that Bond had moments ago given to Camille, only to discover that there is not a second one for him.  The two tumble through the air trying to regain composure and stability, and once Bond grasps on to Camille, the parachute magically opens...about 10 feet from the ground.  The viewer is expected to believe that not only will one parachute adequately support the weight of two people, it will still sufficiently slow their descent even when deployed about one second from impact on the ground.  Give me a break.  (No pun intended.)    (4) Bond meets CIA agent Felix in a rather run-down bar (some kind of hotel lobby?), only to discover that he has been set up and there are lots of Special Ops kinds of dudes rapidly bearing down on him (he literally has only seconds to spare), all wielding the latest in weapon technology.  Surprisingly (sarcasm intended), Bond manages to simply run away from them.    (5) In a fight scene involving Bond and Dominic Greene, Greene picks up a piece of metal railing (essentially, a two-foot long piece of pipe) and nails Bond with direct blows four or five times.  In a scene reminiscent of the old Channel 47-style wrestling, where one guy is beaten to a pulp by the other and then magically gets up to inflict the same injury to his opponent, Bond is almost entirely unharmed by the pipe, and he gets up and...well, you can figure out the scene's resolution.    One other aspect of the movie I found distracting and detrimental was that Bond was beaten-up, bloodied, disheveled, wounded, and raggedy for a significant portion of the movie.  What ever happened to the \\"old-style\\" Bond who after doing away with his adversary simply straightened out his tuxedo and was entirely presentable again, ready to drink his shaken martini and woo the beautiful lady?    Daniel Craig definitely brings a different kind of Bond character to the screen, but I was so busy being annoyed at how poorly this film was done that I didn't really take much notice of his performance.  Maybe that, too, says something.  The bottom line is that you definitely don't want to buy this movie. If you *must* see it, try borrowing from your library or finding a cheap rental before spending money on it.  You may be thankful you did.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Rick Rubin usually has the golden touch - from the Beastie Boys to the Dixie Chicks, to Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond.  But this CD has so many sugar coated power ballads you'd think you just bought a Nickelback CD.<br /><br />There are a few rockers but not enough to offset the bad.<br /><br />Bad Rick Rubin.  Bad.
B001OQCV38|5.0|I have been seeing movies since the late 1940's (\\"The third man\\", \\"Naked city\\"...), so by now I've seen a lot of them.  \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" have three of the most nail-bitting scenes I've ever seen:  (1) The initial sequence at the farmer's house.  (2) The one when Shosha finds herself sharing a table in a fancy Parisian restaurant with Goebbels, his French mistress and several other very sinister characters that keep coming and going.  (3) The whole sequence at the tavern.  If you are not particularly squemish about blood and seeing people being (briefly and seldom) cut up or having their heads bashed in with baseball bats -- and who is going to be upset about that, when nowdays putrid cadavers are shown in loving detail during cop-and-robber TV shows? -- and if you do not like Nazis and people like them, particularly those who tend to get away with mass murder and then go on to live nice, successful, prosperous lives (in the real world, as opposed to works of fiction such as this one):     Go And See IT!    When the DVD/Blue Ray come out, at the very least Rent It, if you have not seen the movie already.    If you are thinking of taking little kids to see this movie, you are either a clueless person, or a bad parent. Bad parent! Bad!

0385342020|4.0|I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's novels and loved them all.  This is not my favorite but it was still a good read.    The story is about Lara Lington who has recently given up a job to become a partner in a headhunter agency with a friend. Lara has never been very successful in her career and is hoping that her new business venture will yield better results for her future.    The Lington family is called upon to attend a funeral for Lara's great-aunt Sadie whom nobody in the family really knows or has paid attention to.  Great-aunt Sadie has died at 105 years of age.  But she has been neglected in a nursing home, for many years with no acknowledgement or visits from family members.    At Sadie's funeral, Lara Lington is accosted by Great-aunt Sadie's ghost.  The story continues with the ghost of great-aunt Sadie pursuing, heckling and convincing Lara to look for a necklace that great-aunt Sadie has lost.    I felt sadness for older family members who are neglected and forgotten about in nursing homes and I feel that Sophie Kinsella sheds light on the fact that our older family members were young once too and they should not be neglected.    If you like stories about mischievious ghosts and can leave your sense of logic behind, you will enjoy Sophie Kinsella's new book.

B0015UKX7E|4.0|This is a great show. The line-up is unexpected and I was entertained from start to end. The picture quality is superb, looks like hi-def on my 720P 37\\" LCD. The sound is crisp and clear, although not loud...I had to set the volume at about 50 which should have blown the doors off.

B001GCUO16|1.0|Like so many Wolverine fans, I actually had high hopes for this movie.  What a let down.  To be perfectly fair I did have expectations for this movie.  These expectations were based on the comic book story line, the overall quality of the previous X-Men movies as well as pure character development.  That being said I feel like this movie was a sham.  I remember watching the previews every five minutes on tv and thinking, wow, this is going to be a great movie.  Look, wolverine is in the civil war and world war II, they are really going to go back and look at the whole history of this rich character and show us how he came to be the character we meet in the X-Men movie.      To my utter dismay, all these scenes about Wolverine's past history amounted to nothing but a montage for the credits to roll over in the beginning of the movie.  Yeah, we get this 7 minute scene when he's a kid but nothing about living through multiple wars or throughout a long period of time.  I realize there is too much story here for a two hour movie but this to me was the essence of the movie.    The characters were also a let down.  Again in fairness, there are several characters and you can't highlight them all but I feel like the trailers also billed this as a movie where we were going to possibly meet some fan favorite X-Men that were left out of the movies.  The obvious pick was Gambit.  I remember he was rumored to be in X-Men 2, that's how long I had waited.  But what I got looked and acted more like David Copperfield than Gambit.    The special effects were nothing to write home about, the story was all over the place and contrived.  Towards the end I felt like I could overhear the corporate talking heads writing this movie, more powers, more powers.  It just felt way over the top.  I always feel like the trick to making a good comic book movie is making a world where the supernatural feels real enough for me to suspend my belief.  If you can make me believe the action I'm seeing then they did a good job.  This just wasn't the case for this movie.    One star for Hugh Jackman as he is great as usual as Wolverine but I would recommend passing on this movie, re-watch X-Men 1 instead, you'll be glad you did.
0316017922|4.0|The booked grabs your attention with facts and research that seems totally impossible.  Example after example forces you to open your mind.  Connections and related applications flood your imagination.    About half way through the author turns to explining the background for successes among specific groups, individuals, and even himself.  This reading is more tedious and wore on me by the end.    Overall, the book is shockingly different.  It is worth the read.  Itis worth the follow=up thought to look for explainable, verifiable, and accurate cause - effect relationships that appear off the charts.
0142000655|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  A great story concerning the interconnected families of the Hamiltons and the Trasks, over several generations, as they become prominent in the Salinas Valley.  As Steinbeck says, this book is about the central issue of good versus evil, and whether we have the ability to choose how to live our lives.  It's also about sons and fathers, what blind love can do to you, and how you need to see the world for what it really is.  Each character is truely unique and engaging.  I could not put this book down, and loved every moment of it.  Steinbeck is an amazing author.
B001UE276A|4.0|The contents of the box and their quality is excellent....maybe even somewhat overboard.  However, if you are looking for a special gift for anyone who loves Depeche Mode this would make an excellent choice.  Keep it sealed or in pristine condition and it will probably be a collector's item one day.     I enjoy the selection of songs, but quite frankly I can't see this group ever topping Violator and, in my opinion, the songs in this set don't even come close.  I ended up ripping the songs I like best (about seven) and putting them on a separate CD.      I bought this in a \\"knee-jerk\\" purchase decision off of a Gold Box Deal with the clock on the offer ticking after I had had a bit too much wine, and if I had it to do over again I would have just gone the route of buying the DVD/CDs on their own for a third the cost instead of the Deluxe Box Set.  I don't really need nor care to own the books, poster, pins, etc. but I did decide to buy and do have them, so c'est la vie. For someone wanting all of these add-ons, though, I think it is worth the price and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at what you get. Again, great idea for that special gift.    I give it four stars out of five, taking one star off simply due to the fact that none of the songs really blew me away like quite a few of the ones off the Violator CD did.  Neverthelss, great group, great collector's item.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|The Audio Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone appears to be a nearly identical replacement lavalier mic from the recently discontinued Audio-Technica ATR-35S Lavalier Microphone.    Reading some blog advice about video podcasting and playing around a bit with making YouTube videos, \\"sound\\" in video is usually the part that makes video quality bad. So I was looking for a reasonably price lapel mic to use. The ATR-3350 is quite inexpensive considering that you can easily spend $200 for a professional model lapel mic.    If you read some of the \\"1\\" (hate it) reviews from the ATR-35S, they pretty much all related to \\"low volume issues\\". You may see some similar reviews here as time goes on. Plugging the ATR-3350 directly into my Dell laptop PC mic in or camera mic in, I also thought the volume is not high enough. However, plugging it into my video camera, it sounded great. Just the right volume. Not too loud or soft.     I went to the support site for ATR and asked my question on volume on my laptop PC mic in. Support on the ATR site was good. I got a quick response back on my question about volume on my laptop. The advice was \\"Look for MIC Boost in the Advanced Controls for microphone in the Volume Control window of Voice recording under the Voice tab of the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties of Windows to boost the level of a microphone. (Windows XP example given.)\\".    I'm giving it  \\"5\\" for the product considering value for the price and the support I got. I'm sure the quality does not get anywhere near professional mics with XLR inputs. Those mics are in a different class. Certainly not in this price range.    Be careful if you have a rolling chair and use this mic near your PC. The cord is thin and probably easy to make the mic \\"nonfunctional\\" if you were to roll over the cable with all your weight pinching the thin cord under a wheel.
B000TO0TB2|2.0|Having read and immensely enjoyed Paul Auster's The Brooklyn Follies, and considering the almost uniformly positive reviews that The New York Trilogy gets from readers and critics alike, I guess I was bound to be disappointed. Auster just seems to try too hard here. The stories are surrealist, which I usually enjoy, but don't make any sense at all. You get to the end of each one and you think: \\"what was that all about?\\" (Yes, it is obviously possible that I just \\"don't get it,\\" but neither might you...) There are occasional cross-references among the three stories, and even those don't make any sense in the context of each individual narrative. In my opinion the third entry in the book is almost salvageable, but even that one will likely disappoint the reader given the non-ending sort of ending. Paul, have you written something better lately? I know you have it in you.
B000002LOE|5.0|REM<br />Out of Time; 1991<br />Warner Brothers<br /><br />My Rating: 90/100<br /><br />REM apparently spent three years exploring their options. After producing six albums in as many years, the band catapulted into the national spotlight in a big way with OUT OF TIME. It marks a huge stylistic shift for the band, featuring a far more acoustic delivery and incorporating rootsy instruments like the mandolin, accordion, and symphonic string arrangments. Although it is common practice to slam this album for its cutesy excesses (witness the silly rapping on \\"Radio Song\\" and the delightfully annoying \\"Shiny Happy People\\", both of which are actually decent songs), it's the lesser known tracks that really shine. While \\"Losing My Religion\\" was the song that redefined the band's sound, \\"Belong\\" and \\"Texarakana\\" both came out of left field and stand as huge artistic leaps for the band. \\"Near Wild Heaven\\" jangles its way into a masterpiece of nostalgic pop (featuring lead vox from Mike Mills), while \\"Me In Honey\\" features an irresistibly soaring chorus and classic REM riff. All in all, what's not to like about this album? It may not be their most influential or the one that all the cool kids talk about, but I can't think of another time when REM made such irrepressibly joyful music. In a world of pretense and image, OUT OF TIME stands as REM's boldest musical statement, and one of the most consistently delightful records in the history of rock and roll. OUT OF TIME?

B001GQSY5K|1.0|LUKE: You fought in the clone wars?  BEN: Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.    LEIA: General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the clone wars.      These quotes lit a fire under our curiosity, and it burned for nearly 30 years.  Now the excitement and anticipation can be satisfied by...    ...the further adventures of little orphan Annie!    CLONE WARS boasts exciting space dogfights and intense light saber duels.  But these things do not make up for where it fails miserably.  Nowhere in this movie do we see the echoes of the great stories hinted in A NEW HOPE.  Nowhere do we see a camaraderie develop between Bail Organa (\\"years ago you served my father\\") and Obi-Wan Kenobi.    Since 20th Century Fox did not release this film (can't say I blame them), the movie opens with the Warner Brothers logo and without the signature Alfred Newman prelude.  There is no written prologue that retreats into the distance of space.  The animation is rather wooden.  This would have been acceptable had the film been made by a studio with a more limited budget.  But it was made by George Lucas who has money coming out of his ears!  Financially, there is no reason why THE POLAR EXPRESS should look better than CLONE WARS.  But even VEGGIE TALES looks better than CLONE WARS.    The plot of CLONE WARS is that the Jedi are summoned to rescue Jabba the Hutt's kidnapped son.  That is the plot of the movie called CLONE WARS.  Can someone please enlighten me as to what that has to do with the Clone Wars?    Jabba junior who inherits the nickname,\\"Stinky\\" is much more annoying than ewoks and Jar Jar Binks put together.  There is even an utterly failed attempt at humor by pointing out that Junior the Hutt made a poopie.  (No, I am not making that up.)  Which, incidentally, is how we arrive at his cute nickname.  Jabba the Hutt's uncle plays a role in the film as well.  Ziro the Hutt does nothing to add to the entertainment value of this heap except to make the viewerwonder whether or not he was based on Truman Capote, for there is an uncanny resemblance.    The music in CLONE WARS almost never sounds like any of the scores composed by John Williams.  Sometimes it sounded like a rock band and sometimes like classical Chinese folk music.    I'm sick and tired of people defending ewoks and Jar Jar Binks by saying it's in there to appeal to the kids.  Where have you been the last 30 years?  It's STAR WARS!  The name alone has kid-appeal and always has.  It has more kid appeal than Fess Parker's Davy Crockett, for crying out loud.  And it had it long before an ewok ever scratched his ear or a Gungan ever ruined a movie.  You might as well complain about Sesame Street not having enough kid appeal.    In a word: Stinky.
B001FB55H6|4.0|I rented Watchmen over the Playstation Network and enjoyed it so much that I decided to buy the director's cut on Blu-ray.  I am pleased with the content and quality of material on this edition, but two things bothered me.  The first thing, and the title of this review, is that the _awesome_ theatrical trailer is not here!  A trailer is included, but it is amazingly lame.  I have to go to YouTube to watch one of the best trailers I've ever seen.<br /><br />I don't understand why studios don't include all the promotional material they can.  It wouldn't take up much space and it's interesting to see how some films are marketed.  However, with many films, the original trailer that made me want to see it in the first place appears no where on the film when I buy it.<br /><br />The second thing that bothered me is that as soon as I opened the box, I'm confronted by a flyer for the \\"Watchmen Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" that's coming in December of 2009!  WTF?  I just bought _this_ edition and now there's going to be a _better_ one coming out?  If I had known, I would have waited!  I'm certainly not going to buy another copy!<br /><br />Other than that, I enjoyed this edition of Watchmen.  There were only a couple extended scenes I felt weren't necessary or weren't in the book.<br /><br />For this price, this is a solid purchase.  Just be aware there's an even _more_ deluxe version coming in December!!

0930289234|5.0|Watching the film made me want to read the book.  To be honest, I'd never heard of the book until I saw film trailers.  I guess I live in a cave.<br /><br />What can one say?  All the individual comic books have been combined into one volume.  As long as it's all here, and I wouldn't know, then there's no better version out there.  The printing and color is top-notch, as is the paper.<br /><br />One gripe I do have is that the images in the pages are printed too close to the binding.  I'm not a book-folder, so I don't want to have to open the book _all_ the way up to see the edges of the panels.  I'd have preferred it was given an extra 3-4mm of margin space.<br /><br />Considering the price of this item, there's no reason you shouldn't buy it.
0140001115|4.0|Sherlock Holmes made his debut in \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", a novella first published in 1887. He and his sidekick, Doctor John H Watson, appeared in over fifty mysteries together. \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is probably the pair's most famous case, and was inspired by a legend about a ghostly hound that haunted Dartmoor. The story was first serialised in the Strand Magazine, with the final instalment appearing in 1902 - and the complete book first appearing that same year.<br /><br />Although Holmes will be seen as the book's hero, it's Watson who tells the story. The pair's involvement with case begins with a visit from Dr James Mortimer - although, initially, he has stopped by only for a little advice. Mortimer has travelled up to London from his home on the edge of Dartmoor. Sir Charles Baskerville, an elderly neighbour of Mortimer's, has recently died and the doctor is in town to meet his successor. However, thanks to a family legend, the details of the death have the whole community panicking. Back in the 1700s, the man who ruled Baskerville Hall - Sir Hugo - was anything but a virtuous man. Having kidnapped the daughter of a neighbouring yeoman - she wouldn't come willingly - he wasn't at all pleased when she later escaped and fled across the moors. In true Monty Burns style, he pledges himself to all that was unholy, unleashes the hounds and sets out after her. Unfortunately, things don't quite go according to plan. While a huge ghostly hound joins the hunt and the girl dies of fear and exhaustion, Sir Hugo also dies and the hound feasts on his throat. Holmes, of course, views this as little more than a fairy tale. However, those who live close to Baskerville Hall are worried that the curse of the Baskervilles has returned. Several have seen a huge black hound on the moors, \\"luminous, ghastly and spectral\\", while Mortimer himself discovered massive paw-prints close to where Sir Charles' body was found. Unlike Hugo, Sir Charles was very highly thought of by all those who knew him. Dr Mortimer is naturally very concerned for Sir Charles' nephew and heir. Sir Henry, the last surviving Baskerville, will very shortly be arriving in London from Canada.<br /><br />Naturally, the bad news keeps coming for Sir Henry. He has barely arrived in London when he receives a mysterious letter warning him to keep away from Baskerville Hall, there's a mysterious bearded man is following his every move, an escaped killer is living rough on the moors and (strangely) someone keeps stealing his boots. Not to be put off, Sir Henry decides to return to the ancestral home - though not without Watson. Holmes, initially, is unable to join them - there are a few cases in London needing his immediate attention. However, he does issue Watson with some very clear instructions on how to proceed.<br /><br />A short and easy read...though not quite as scary or as dramatic as I'd imagined. I'd put this partly down to the `old fashioned' writing - while it was probably pacey stuff at the time it was written, it's a little stiff and formal by today's standards. I was also a little disappointed with Holmes : while Watson was a likeable character, I couldn't really warm to the great Sherlock. He struck me as an egotistical showman, a little too keen to hog the spotlight. (He practically threw a huff when Mortimer compared him unfavourably to Bertillion). He appeared desperate to deduce everything - whether he needed to or not - so that people could marvel at his incredible intellect. ( I also wondered if he was - at least partly - trying to keep Watson in his place). Still, there isn't too much damage done : Holmes goes missing for a stretch, and that gives Watson - who is much more likeable - the limelight.e who knew him.

While it was light years beyond the failed Spirits Within movie, it was still lacking.  This new release includes scenes that really do enrich the story, making the overall flow better and a more enjoyable experience.  I guess if you speak japanese and/or have a keen understanding of japanese culture then the dvd version might fare just fine for you.  Reccommended for all true Final Fantasy fans...what the hay, reccommended for all true entertainment seekers!

B001HZK8FO|5.0|The Notebook is an old-school romantic movie based on the age-old dilemma - rich girl, poor guy. Midway through the movie, we have the spanner in the works thrown by the rich guy (`Southern money'). The movie is all about how the poor guy wins her back. But it is told in flashback form, via a Notebook read by James Garner, who is really Noah (the male lead) in old age. The love of his life, the rich girl in the flashback scenes, now suffers from memory loss and Noah hopes to revive her memory by reading the memoirs. There is one particularly effective sequence, where she suddenly remembers Noah and then forgets him just seconds later. The ending could have been better, but movies do take liberties with what happens in real life. This movie also reminds me of Away from Her, a recent Canadian movie that runs along similar lines, in which Julie Christie's character suffers from memory loss.   Even more than the storyline itself, what you will remember afterwards is the care taken to recreate 40s America. Costumes, shops, streets, cars, houses are all authentically recreated to the point that you instantly know it depicts an era gone by. The settings are incredibly vivid and colorful in the blu-ray edition. The lake scenes have been beautifully shot.  This is a movie that men can easily relate to, though there is a notion that romantic movies are mainly aimed at women. This is a movie for all those who love life. There are ups and downs in our lives, but love will often find a way. The Notebook will rekindle the flames of romance in your heart. It is a good story well told, and an ideal way to spend a lazy afternoon or evening. It deserves to be seen.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|Frankly, I haven't liked many of the vampire movies that hit the theatres in the recent past. They had very little substance, apart from gore and blood. The only upside was the superb special effects. One did not however feel they were `real' characters, if you can use that term for a bloodthirsty vampire.  Into this arid cinematic landscape comes Let the Right One In, a Swedish movie that tells the moving story of a young vampire. The hauntingly beautiful story is rather simple - the vampire girl Eli (\\"I have been 12 for a long time\\"), develops a relationship with Oskar, a 12-year-old boy who is tormented by classmates at his Stockholm school. Their relationship blossoms in a frozen landscape, amidst the frenzy of murder necessitated by Eli's thirst for blood and Oskar's travails at school.  It is a voyage of discovery for both protagonists in the movie - they learn the finer points of life (and death) from each other.  The viewer immediately warms up to both characters, played brilliantly by the two first-time leads. It is hard not to sympathise with Oskar, who finally learns to `handle' his tormentors the hard way on Eli's advice. Eli is one vampire you do not hate - her life is one long struggle for blood, company and love. The film does have gore - but it is not the primary focus. It has plenty of blood, but in the director's hand it becomes the conduit through which the two characters bond. Oskar stands by Eli even after learning that she is a vampire. If that is not love, what is ?  In that context, The Right One is a love story par excellence. The one thing that could have prevented Oskar from reaching out to Eli instead becomes their greatest strength. In one instance, Oskar saves Eli's life from a potential killer. The would-be killer ends up being a source of blood for Eli. She repays her gratitude in the final sequences of the film. Indeed, the eerie swimming pool scene is one of the finest moments of horror seen on film recently.   As for the technicalaspects of the film, the cinematography is nothing short of excellent. It captures the desolate and snowy landscape of Sweden so well that one cannot help feeling the cold. The special effects are excellent for a non-Hollywood film. I am sure they will have better special effects in the forthcoming American remake, but will it retain the `soul' of this Swedish masterpiece? The acting is uniformly good too. There is no doubt that two leads will get more roles in Swedish and foreign films in the future.  There is a great debate on the Internet about the subtitle translation, but I did not encounter any problems on this Optimum UK release sourced from Amazon UK. Having no knowledge of Swedish, I cannot say whether it is the best available, but it worked for me and I had no trouble comprehending the dialogues. Of course, one always has to take into account that in any language, there are subtle nuances, play on words and unique idioms and expressions that may not lend themselves so well to translation in to another language.  I have also not read the book, so I do not know how faithful the film is to the book (I know some changes have been done). But taken on its own, the film is well paced. This could be due to the fact that the author of the book has written the movie script as well.   Technically, the DVD is brilliant and the blu-ray must be even better. There were hardly any artefacts in the many night scenes. The sound is not demo material, but the engineers have crafted it well to match the `atmosphere' conveyed in the film.  In short, this is one film you should have in your DVD/blu-ray library. It is a remarkable piece of contemporary cinema, one that you would not forget for a long time. It will require the full attention of your mind - and the heart - for 110 minutes, but it's worth every second. Films like this come along only rarely, so treasure it while you can.
0451196716|4.0|This was the first Stephen King book I'd ever read.  Some \\"friends\\" recommended that it was one of his best, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Before this my only real exposure to the horror genre was reading Poe in high school.  Overall I found this to be a good reading experience, though it was a little long and the end was disappointing.<br /><br />Every year, 100 teenage boys go through The Long Walk, a competition of endurance and survival.  They start near the Canadian border in Maine (being a King book, where else would it start?) and go through New Hampshire, possibly into Massachusetts if anyone survives.  The winner receives a Prize, wherein supposedly they receive everything they could ever want.  The only drawback is that if you don't win, you die.  Get three warnings in a row and you get executed.<br /><br />So the rules are simple:  keep walking or die.  There are no stops to use the bathroom or sleep or eat or get a foot massage.  You walk all day and all night until you stop walking and die.  It's sort of like the Tour de France then if the bikers had to keep riding 24 hours a day and the losers were all killed.  The contest is broadcast on TV and is a huge thing in Vegas.  Throngs of people show up on the sidelines to cheer on the Walkers, showing little concern even as the losers are shot on live TV.  (A similar premise to another King story, \\"The Running Man.\\"  With reality TV the way it is today, is such a thing really so implausible?  I think not.)<br /><br />In the current year's competition is young Ray Garrarty, a local boy from a small town in Maine.  His father was abducted years ago by \\"the Squads\\", some kind of fascist secret police.  (The story takes place in an alternate history where either the US lost WWII or otherwise turned into a fascist state.  It's not entirely clear what happened, but there is mention of Germans bombing the US east coast and a raid on a German nuclear plant in Santiago in the '50s.)  Ray has since lived with his mother and has a girlfriend named Jan.  But for whatever reason he signs up for the Long Walk along with 99 other boys from around the country.  He bonds with some of them like the cynical McVries and the weirdly prophetic Stebbins even as they are ostensibly trying to kill each other.  They face a variety of physical challenges like steep hills, cramps, and fever but the real challenge is the mental fatigue from pushing on while watching all the people around you drop and die.  Can Ray make it to the end?  And what then?<br /><br />I thought this book probably would have worked better as a short story or novella.  At 370 pages it's a little too long.  It sort of sets into this pattern of they walk for a while, someone gets shot, they talk to each other, some more people get shot.  Yadda, yadda, yadda.  What saves it though is the bonding between Ray, McVries, and the other characters as they become well-fleshed characters.  You really do want to see who's going to make it and who isn't.<br /><br />The end was disappointing, ending with a whimper instead of a bang.  After going so far, I was really hoping for something a little more epic when it gets down to the last handful of people, but instead King/Bachman wraps up the last stage in just a couple of pages.  So it seems like a lot of buildup for little payoff.<br /><br />Still, it was a good book and makes me want to get my copy of \\"The Green Mile\\" off the shelf.<br /><br />That is all.mother and has a girlfriend named Jan.

B0000AC8LL|5.0|This is an absolutely fascinating historical journey told with great accuracy and nuance.  It examines how all the intricate parts interacted to create first the debacle that was the Pearl Harbor attack to the coming war that utterly ruined Japan for a generation.  In a deeper sense, the story is about the collision of two cultures that couldn't be more different, with catastrophic results.<br /><br />The sophistication of the presentation is truly wonderful, with psychological nuance in the doubts and bravado of Japanese power brokers and a comedy of errors on the American side.  The portraits of the Japanese leaders are balanced, ignoring no complexity and studying their characters.  The army has more of less taken control, pushing their diplomats into an ill-considered alliance with fascist Germany, which came to distort the image of a militarist/nationalist Japan into something much worse (and inaccurate).  The emperor's family is weak, fantasy prone, and complicit, while the rank and file are convinced that their fighting spirit makes them superior to decadent Americans. Fascinatingly, it is the commanding admiral who wants to avoid the army-led war, though he dutifully prepares a daring attack on the US navy's principal base in the Pacific, PH.<br /><br />On the American side, there are many complacent skeptics, but others who appear nearly prescient in their fears.  Many small decisions are made - to place fighter aircraft in the center of the airfield to protect them from sabotage, but rendering them vulnerable to air attack - that add up to a total lack of preparedness.  Some flacks even picked up the Japanese attack squadron on radar, which their immediate superiors blithely chose to ignore.  Many US leaders sensed something was coming, but could not effectively mount a lasting defense.<br /><br />The film ends ominously for the Japanese.  While claiming a decisive tactical victory, a diplomatic flub up (a slow typist delayed the declaration of war until 1 hour after the attack) threatened to \\"awaken the giant\\" of American military might with righteous rage.  The result was a gigantic war of attrition, which the Americans were bound to win.<br /><br />I remember seeing this as a child, expecting a war film and getting diplomacy for the first 2 hours instead.  The end battle is spectacular, but for a kid was too long in coming.  As an adult steeped in history, it is the greatest feast of detail.  That makes this, for the time, a daring accomplishment, when what sold was John Wayne mythology rather than accurate history.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.k) threatened to \\"awaken the giant\\" of American military might with righteous rage.

Honestly, if I wasn't such a fan of the series, I'd probably give this a much lower rating.  Standing alone, it really was just okay.  It is clearly a supplement to the series, something I wasn't expecting.  I honestly thought it was a stand-alone read, which it wasn't.  If you are a fan of the series, then get this and read it-- there's no stopping you.  If you haven't yet read the Potter books, then DON'T READ THIS-- spoilers abound, and significant spoilers at that.    It was really just okay.
B001FB4W02|4.0|Smallville is the rare show that actually seems to genuinely improve with age, season after season.  There was a time when I believed that the life of the show was being artificially extended solely for profit, but the acting and production value is genuinely excellent, and years later this is still one of my favorite shows.    Tom Welling as \\"Clark Kent\\" is excellent.  I literally do not think they could have chosen a better person for the role.  To me he embodies who the character is and he has the acting ability to easily pull off the role and leave the viewer wanting more.  As I watch \\"Clark\\" go through his highs and lows on the show, it is as if I am experiencing those same events myself, the good and the bad, and I love it.    Erica Durance has become every bit as good in her role as \\"Lois Lane\\" as Tom Welling is at being \\"Clark Kent\\".  She is the penultimate Lois and this season really brings that home.  The flirtatious and romantic moments between the two characters are magical and as the viewer you find yourself emotionally tangled up in the drama onscreen, and wondering what's going to happen next.    They have managed to take the essence of the classic Superman movies and comic books and modernize it for today's audience, but at the same time they have perfected the formula, to the extent that this is the version of the mythology that I prefer above all others, this is the Superman that I would want my kids to grow up watching and listening to and admiring.    The special effects are excellent, as always, but as I said, the thing that has made this season for me, so far, are the little details, the story, the great acting, and the interaction between the various characters, the wonderful escalation of character relationships that have been years in the making.    The downside of loving the show this much is that I know one day it will come to an end and I will be heart-broken.    There is a problem accessing the episode menu for these blu-rays, which means that unless you watch each disk all the way through, when you come back later in the day to continue watching, or the next day, you will have to search through each disk, chapter by chapter to find the episode that you stopped at.  This is why I rated the blu-ray version of this season 4 out of 5 stars instead of 5 out of 5, and this is the only thing that makes this season less then perfect, in my opinion.
B001FB4VZS|2.0|My wife and I have enjoyed the series for many years as have our kids, now 16 and 12 so they have really grown up with this.    My wife was dissapointed that Lex is gone.  Also she felt that, as do I, that the Justice League needs to come out to play more.  They are a large part of the lore of Superman.  This season seems like it is becoming something like a One Tree Hill or some other teen angst tv show more then it used to be.      Also, as others have stated the package design is terrible.  Mine had SIX broken pieces of plastic and the whole bottom part where the bottom cylinder fits down was totally shattered.  The first 4 seasons are great packages, after that the package has gotten terrible.    I emailed the WB to let them know about my broken package but of course no response, as they already have my money I assume.    So overall would almost give this season a three as it is OK, barely, but the package design knocks it down a star, so 2 stars it is.
B002GPNQXU|5.0|1.Here We Go Again - The album is named after this song and has a music video to go along. I think it's really relative to if you're going through a rough relationship. And it has a really good beat and the lyrics are totally true. It just makes you want to sing along right away. This is one of my top #1 favorite songs off the album    2.Solo - This song starts off kinda slow but then as the song goes on it gets faster and more upbeat. This is a great song to think about after a breakup and it's beat is really good to dance to when your bored or your sad and want to be happy. I personally love this song...it's one of my favorites    3.U Got Nothin' On Me - I love the first part of the song because it's different and the beat gets you really hyper and ready to hear a good song. It something that everyone can sing along to and even if your not a Demi fan you still have to love the song. I also like this one    4.Falling Over Me - This is another song that starts off slow. We're used to Demi's music being rock and fast and this one shows another slower side to her music. I think anyone can relate to this song and the lyrics are so true in so many different situations. It features the amazing Jon McLaughin!    5.Quiet - This song is another that starts off slow. I love the beat because it's like slow and quiet and then all of a sudden it's gets loud and fast. This song is just the perfect song to sing at a concert and it's probably my second favorite song.     6.Catch Me - I think this song totally came from her song Don't Forget. It has the same beat if you really listen and it has basically the same topic. It's kinda like a part 2 to Don't Forget. I like it and the fact that she wrote a part 2 to Don't Forget.    7.Every Time You Lie - This song sounds like a jazz song you would here in a coffee shop or a small club or something. I love it it's something different than the music we here now it's going back to Jazz. Fourth favorite song    8.Got Dynamite - Got Dynamiteis definitely rock and it seems so Demi. This song is definitely up her ally and that's why she sounds so good singing it.     9.Stop The World- This song was co-written by Nick Jonas and I love lyrics. Any lyrics Nick writes or help writes always sound so good when there song. I love the message hidden in it and I love the beat in it. I was really into it when I first heard it.     10.World of Chances - This song was written by Demi and John Mayor. It definitely says John Mayor in it. It's not really one of my favorite songs I mean I'm not really into it but I still thinks it's an ok song    11.Remember December - I love this song! This is my second #1 song off the album. This and Here We Go Again are tied. The beat makes it so easy to dance to. The lyrics are also fun. I love Demi's voice in this one it shows are strong her voice is    12.Everything You're Not - This is another start off slow song. I think that when Demi was singing this song she really got into it. It's just one of those songs that you kinda have to love. It's a really good song.    13.Gift of a Friend - I think this song is one of the slowest off the album. It's something we really wouldn't expect from Demi because it's so slow and she's usually fast and upbeat. But when you hear the song you love it. It shows she has a different side of her voice and shows that she's not all rock. This is my third favorite song because it's the truth and it's real.    14.So Far So Great - Is the theme song for Sonny With a Chance. Everyone loves to sing and dance along to this song. I love it.
B000GKHM2S|5.0|An old film, indeed. The music is less present than I remembered (I only knew the opera and must have the old vinyl somewhere in my back boxes) but it is the Who without any hesitation. We go back to a period, the early 60s, when the youth born after the war was starting to get bored with the no-game society we were having then. And the new music was working them deep in their flesh, more than just plain rock and roll, but the second revolution of that rock and roll planet, the presently at the time being born English rock and roll. The Beatles were looming on the horizon and the Rolling Stones slightly later.<br /><br />The youth were following two life styles, in fact a division in two vast camps, clans, armies even, societies definitely: the mods and the rockers. The film shows how these young people identify with a way to dress, a way to move around with scooters carrying dozens of rear view mirrors, drugs of course, alcohol, and the myth of becoming the kings of the world by defeating the other side. It was not yet the big professional football championships and their violence in Liverpool or Manchester, but it was just the same thing: violence, sex, drugs, alcohol and music.<br /><br />The interest of the film is essentially the fact that it is a real documentary about this period, a bright and illuminating documentary about what has been haunting this society since 1945.To avoid the mistakes and the crimes of ,the previous generations young people have to live their lives out of politics, but life is conflicts and contradictions, so if these are not political, if these are not racial, if these are not national or ethnic, they have to be cultural. The future of the world is cultural or shall not be. Culture is dressing, music, what you drink, etc, what you do with the section of the income you have that is not absolutely necessary for your survival.<br /><br />This budget line started appearing among the people at the end of the Middle Ages and Ben Jonson illustrated it in his Bartholomew Fair. Here it is illustrated in London and Brighton, but it is the same: free time becomes the objective of life to spend that budget line. And if you do not have that budget line, then you can always steal it from society or borrow it from someone, steal drugs from a pharmacy or borrow a scooter from a stranger. But this leads to conflict with society, with the parents first, with justice second, and with bosses third and in front of this trilogy, or should I say trinity, holy trinity maybe, just take a scooter and fly off the top of some white cliff.<br /><br />And what has changed since then? Nothing except that some vast humanitarian and sociological, societal as some have invented, questions have caught up in this world that is becoming globalized at light speed. Maybe though difference and tolerance are better accepted and practiced there are a lot more divisions and some are crisscrossing one another. It is not only mod versus rockers, but what about a black gay techno rock guy versus ... what exactly? And yet groups do not mix that easily.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUstrated it in his Bartholomew Fair.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|OK, so I'm a big fan of British actor Colin Firth. Especially so after seeing his BBC movie \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (or maybe it was the other way around). Anyway I loved that movie. I watched it so many times it made me want to read the book. I bought a hard copy edition but never took time to read it, just kept watching that movie. Kindle had a free edition, I said what the heck and I loaded it. Knowing the story already, I delved into the book. Happy was I to see that the movie was almost totally in sync with the book! I absolutely love the story. The \\"prejudiced\\" Lizzy reluctantly falling in love with the \\"proud\\" Darcy, and the Darcy who had too much Pride to get over his Prejudice towards her \\"lowly connections.\\"<br /><br />I will read it again definitely; it's got to be my favorite book, especially in the classics.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Political thrillers are always very tricky and difficult, maybe even dangerous. But the BBC loves those difficulties and carries them out with grace and effectiveness. The paramour of an English MP around 2005, hence quite obviously under a Labor government, dies by being pushed in front of an underground train in London. The MP is chairing a special committee on energy and is confronted to the hostility of oil companies and other energy lobbies. At the very same time a young black man is killed in an alley and another witness of this killing is shot though not dead. Are the three events connected since they happen in exactly the same time bracket, in sequence and in the same area?<br /><br />It will appear that the killer of the two people on the surface is the person who pushed the lady-friend of the MP, a lady who was important because she had just been hired by the MP for her energy competence and expertise, though it will appear that she was by far not the best qualified person and that she was very directly connected with one dominant oil company. So why was she hired? Pressure on the MP or favoritism from the MP? In the middle of the series we learn that she was pregnant, which the MP ignored. Most of the investigation is done by a small team of journalists and one important editor in one London newspaper. The police is marginalized by this active press team, and they resent it for a long time, though after a while they have to reckon the journalists have methods that enable them to get more information out of the witnesses, and even eventually the MP and other members of the majority and government. Just for this responsible but obstinate and constant role of English journalists this miniseries is a lesson to the world about the media, even concerning the clear pressure they are under from political bodies and from corporations, often disguised as some kind of criminal activity.<br /><br />To do that job is a real fight with the world, life and even death when a witness dies before questioning, or a murderer is shot dead at point blank by the special forces of the police preventing any kind of questioning and truth discovering, which can only come after an arrest, not a burial. The second genial element in this film is of course the tremendous case of lobbies, here oil and energy lobbies, and how they infiltrate all kinds of bodies to get direct information from inside, and at times this infiltration is done with the help and support of some members of the cabinet (ministers in other words, members of the government). They also use a lot of money to cover up all kinds of shady events and to pay all kinds of bills so that the beneficiaries are more lenient and attentive to their recommendations. That kind of lobbying is clearly criminal in the fact that it is always trying to hijack the political machine and to impose their interests as the norm for everyone. It is unjust, unequal, discriminatory, unreasonable most of the time, since it is the will of the very few who gets the ears of the decision makers of a nation and it is the interests of these few that are taken into account instead of the more objective needs of the vast majority, of the many. This miniseries is crystal clear about that kind of functioning and the perverse effects it may have on the governmental and legislative machines. But the film is a lot more than just that.<br /><br />It is full of suspense and that suspense never stops till the very last minute of the sixth episode. The suspense is about the role of the MP, the determination of his best friend, the freelance journalist leading the investigation, the wavering of the MP's wife who should be irreversibly angry at that paramour and affair, and at the pregnancy of that outsider, and she should either accept the situation for the sake of their children, or ask for a divorce, the second probably first. But she beats about the bush and develops an affair with the journalist for the obvious reason of getting some information from him, and drops him at the end with the beautiful words \\"arrogant prick\\". And it is at this moment the role of the MP in the killing is going to be finally discovered with a final revelation from him to the journalist. Have a good time watching that miniseries of nearly six hours and never believe what you may think is obvious at any moment in the film.<br /><br />It is so well built that you will have to wait for the last five minutes to finally be sure of what the truth is, just like journalists must do: never work on conviction or feeling but on tangible hard evidence, otherwise you may end in prison.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUf getting some information from him, and drops him at the end with the beautiful words \\"arrogant prick\\".

B001KVZ6G6|2.0|I haven't seen the movie so this rating reflects the packaging. The thing I found real funny was the little sign or sticker (can't tell) that says $74 value. NO MOVIE is worth $74!!! Why are we forced to pay for the Blu-Ray and DVD? Why isn't there a cheaper 3-disc version without the DVD movie? Also if this movie was in 3-D why isn't it in 3-D on the discs? It can be done, I have Journey to the Center of the Earth and My Bloody Valentine which both has good 3-D effects. If I knew for sure I could sell off the dvd movie disc for $10 I'd buy this for the $31 Amazon is asking for. What Pixar is doing is robing it's fans buy making us pay twice for the same movie and it's wrong. They should be charging $25 for this and throwing the dvd movie for free. I also noticed blu-ray has been out for a bit and the prices of new releases are going up instead of down, Star Trek, Transformers 2, Up I refuse to pay more than $25 (with free shipping and no tax) or $20 (with shipping &/or tax) for a blu-ray otherwise I will wait and buy a used copy or when it comes down in price, whichever comes first. Also what's up with the limited Edition, over $100 for the movie and what appears to be a lamp, come on really, who's stupid to fall for that?
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I will say that this is my favorite version of Pride and Prejudice.  I know that the story had to be condensed to fit within the 2 hour running time, but Keira and Matthew took my breathe away from the first scene.  If you are looking for a version with some passion and sex appeal, this is the one for you!
B00005JK8K|2.0|When I first heard about this movie, I couldn't wait to see it. I even broke the \\"let's wait until it is on video\\" rule we have in our family and went to see it in the movies. Having studied the Navajo codetalker's history , I couldn't believe how minimized their contribution was in the film.  Instead of a history on how this program came about, the selection of the participants or in indepth look at how they fared afterward, we get \\"treated\\" to a poorly filmed movie about Nicholase Cage and Christian Slater. Big deal.  I kept saying throughout the movie,\\" and when are we going to focus on the navajo codetalkers?\\"  A huge hype for a mediocre action film. Not worth your time.

0312360266|4.0|The first in the series of the House of Night novels is well worth picking up. Marked introduces us to a vampyre finishing school, a brand new take on becoming a vampyre. Most books I have read about vampires feature them being changed and having to adjust without a lot of guidance, and the change takes no time at all. In this series a person is marked by a vampyre tracker for the change. Once they have been marked they must move into the House of Night finishing school where they will spend 4 years making the change gradually. According to a High Priestess, about 1 in 10 of the vampyre fledglings do not survive the change, their body rejects it and they die, quickly.<br /><br />We are introduced to our lead Zoey when she is marked. She stands apart from the crowd instantly and must come to terms that she will always be different from the other fledglings. She faces opposition in the house because of her uniqueness and must remain strong to overcome the adversity.<br /><br />Zoey learns early on that there is a greater purpose for her to serve, and she spends a lot of time trying to figure out what that is. She uses the guidance of her spirit elders for guidance and finds herself jumping to the head of the class.<br /><br />A very exciting and interesting take on vampyres. I like the use of magic throughout the stories, it adds an additional element of the supernatural to the mix. If you are looking for a new series to start, try this one. Its been a pleasure to read so far! Cannot wait to find out what happens in Betrayed.
B00008977N|5.0|Something 'happens' to Peter Gabriel when he gets in front of a crowd.  He is simply outstanding and this is an incredible performance...from the electrifying opening song, 'Come Talk to Me', to the end of the show; nonstop.  I highly recommend this to anybody who is a Gabriel fan.  This is Mr. Gabriel at his best.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I've always been a fan of Star Trek. I was very young when it was on NBC in the late sixties and became an avid fan when it went into syndication. I enjoyed the animated series and then the movies. I welcomed The Next Generation and the other series to follow. I'm a big fan of Star Trek Voyager - Janeway is awesome. I couldn't wait to see the new Star Trek movie. I looked forward to seeing other actors playing the original roles and felt that it was such a compliment to the original cast for their roles to be reproduced 40 years later. When the movie started I was in awe and was quickly swept away in the youthful exuberance and non-stop action. It was different than the original, but that was OK. But then the unthinkable happened. The destruction of Vulcan and the assassination of the original timeline knocked the wind out of me. I kept waiting for the salvation of THE Star Trek universe that I had been a part of for the past 40 years. When the movie ended, I was confused and let down, mostly because I had enjoyed the first half of the film so much. The changing of the timeline was not necessary. I have heard many reviewers say that the complex continuity that has been developed throughout the years was too restrictive and had to be eliminated. Well, all I can say is that I have quite a lot of respect for writers. A good writer would have been able to come up with a script that would hold the interest of the old and new fan. In fact, the first half of the movie proves that is possible. My impression is that the assassination of THE Star Trek universe was very deliberate. The director and writers went out of their way to tell original Trek fans to go to hell. The director, in so many words, told trekkies to \\"stay home and skip this one\\". It was very deliberate. I guess he felt that by tossing original Trek fans overboard, they would make more room for the new ones. But the Star Trek Universe is big, and frankly I think there was enough room in that universe for the old and the new fans. I think J.J. never really grasped the size of the Trek Universe. A MESSAGE TO PARAMOUNT: With the TRUE Star Trek Universe erased from existence, I think it would be useless to spend any more money on the franchise. After all, what good is it to own the Star Trek movies on blu-ray if the events in those movies never took place. The same goes for novelizations, collectibles, etc. I wonder if the new fans will be as eager to spend their money on your alternate franchise.
B002BFBAWO|4.0|This was a really fun, heart warming movie with a little bit of tension, a little bit of comedy and a whole lot of honesty thrown in.  I think you'd have to be the age the characters were in the movie during the mid to late 80's to fully appreciate the setting.  It captured the era perfectly!  (I swear I think I had the big, red, plastic heart earrings Lisa P wore!)  The soundtrack was stellar.  The acting for the most part was great.  (I'm not a huge K Stewart fan!)  Bill Hader, Martin Starr, Jesse Eisenberg and Margarita Levieva were all perfectly cast and had moments in the movie that made me cry I was reminising/laughing so hard.  If you're looking for a great reminder of the age, a reminder of your life at that time or just a good movie in general, pick this one up!  If you're looking for another Superbad... you might want to pass.
B0000029LG|4.0|Michael Jackson's 1995 double album [[ASIN:B0000029LG HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]] is perhaps the King of Pop's most controversial album.  Released after his first child molestation allegation, the pain and the scorn of Jackson following this messy situation is obviously reflected through the socially-conscious material featured on the second disc of HIStory. HIStory is easily Jackson's most social-conscious affair, bottling previous socially conscious ideas into one brand new CD.  HIStory today is scarcely available in comparison to Jackson's other studio albums.  As to why, it could be a number of factors including the overt controversy surrounding the material, or perhaps just the fact that it is a double album and costs much more than the standard $7.99 price tag carried by other albums.  Whatever the reasons behind the scarcity, they certainly don't dictate the quality of this brilliant, Grammy-nominated (Album of the Year among other nominations) album. It is just as good as anything Jackson has ever released in my eyes.<br /><br />For the purposes of this review, I will only mention the first disc, HIStory Begins in passing.  This disc features greatest hits of Jackson up to this point.  These hits include key tracks from [[ASIN:B00005QGAT Off the Wall]] (\\"Rock With You\\", \\"She's Out Of My Life\\", \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\"), [[ASIN:B00005QGAZ Thriller]] (\\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\"), [[ASIN:B00005QGAX Bad]] (\\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", \\"Bad\\", \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", \\"Man In the Mirror\\") and [[ASIN:B00005QGAV Dangerous]] (\\"Black Or White\\", \\"Remember The Time\\", and \\"Heal The World\\"). Overall, these were representative of Jackson's \\"greatest hits\\" at the time.  Personally, I don't particularly listen to the first disc only because I have ALL of Jackson's other studio albums and also have a more complete greatest hits set.  But for a fan who wants to hear Jackson at his best and wants a representative, concise compilation, the first disc of HIStory (which was later released as a single disc) is a good choice, though not better than say NUMBER ONES.  The focus oc this review will be the disc of new material (HIStory continues, Disc 2).<br /><br />Disc 2, the main attraction of HIStory is where the controversy looms.  Opening track \\"Scream\\" a manic, but incredibly catchy and sound duet between Jackson and his sister Janet, sets the tone for the entire album.  Maybe never has one heard Michael Jackson sound so agitated and energized by the many agonies of his life.  Perhaps what is so shocking is the 'f-bomb' that Jackson drops (\\"stop f**king with me/makes me wanna scream\\"). Busy production amps up this killer work, nominated for a Grammy.  It would turn out to be Jackson's only recorded collaboration with his sister Janet that we know.  5 star performance, easily.<br /><br />\\"They Don't Care About Us\\" is easily the album's most controversial number, but also perhaps the best and most socially aware we have seen Michael Jackson.  A slew of controversial lines caused censorship to rear it's ugly head, most notably \\"jew me/sue me\\", which is partially censored by a loud, rollicking synth track.  No matter how you feel about the lyrics, this song is genius, propelled even more by an incredible groove and Jackson's spot on vocals. Another 5 star performance.<br /><br />\\"Stranger in Moscow\\" may have big shoes to fill following the manic \\"Scream\\" and the overt \\"They Don't Care About Us\\", but it fills those shoes well proving to be one killer, poignant ballad. The disconnect in which Jackson sings within this chilling track is an easy connect to the audience to anybody who has ever felt lost or lacking of direction in life.  \\"This Time Around\\" is good, though not as good as either \\"Scream\\" or \\"They Don't Care About Us\\". With that said, \\"This Time Around\\" is still way above par and is still signature Michael Jackson.<br /><br />One of my personal favorites has also stemmed it fair share of controversy.  \\"Earth Song\\" has been both praised and cursed, but I personally think aside from being an anomaly, it is one brilliant song.  Jackson is in his best voice here, particularly at the epic end where he ad libs alongside Andrae Crouch's gospel choir. Pop, Gospel, Soul, and Rock all bottled together, it is no wonder why brother Jermaine and father Joe Jackson consider \\"Earth Song\\" their favorite Michael Jackson song.<br /><br />\\"D.S.\\" will prove confusing to the uneducated listener behind the meaning of the song, but will still resonate nonetheless.  Based upon the prosecutor trying to bring down Jackson (here D.S. stands for 'Dom Sneddron' or some similar name), the song is quite powerful and very groovy.  \\"Money\\" is a bit of an odder fit for Jackson, but it will grow on the listener.  Better though is Jackson's fine cover of \\"Come Together\\" by the Beatles.  While the King of Pop doesn't ultimately usurp the original, his cover is great by all means.<br /><br />\\"You Are Not Alone\\" is easily another Jackson classic that arrived after Jackson's 'peak', if you will.  Written by an equally controversial R. Kelly, \\"You Are Not Alone\\" is a beautiful ballad which Michael sings angelically.  The matching video is the slightest bit awkward, but despite this, the song is powerful and pleasing to listen to over and over again.  \\"Childhood (Theme from 'Free Willy 2')\\" is solid, but doesn't seek to break any barriers, particularly compared to more socially conscious material.  It still reflects an \\"agonized\\" man questioning where his 'childhood' went and why he was stripped of one of the basic, fundamentals of life.<br /><br />\\"Tabloid Junkie\\" points fingers at the media, while \\"2 Bad\\" proves to be another rollicking uptempo, high-energy dance track. \\"History\\" is strong, if a bit odd.  It does feature a memorable hook, signature of Jackson's work.  \\"Little Susie\\" doesn't stand out amongst the strongest material, though the closing \\"Smile\\" is perfect by all means.<br /><br />Essentially a good album, HIStory is a bit overstuffed, but should remain as a classic album. It was an incredibly successful double album debuting at #1 where it reigned in the U.S. for three weeks I believe.  In my opinion it is too often overlooked in Jackson's catalog.

B000NU2CY4|1.0|Well, I like this movie as much as my fellow neighbour and has waited for this a long time, because it is one of the most sought after mainstream movies, that would deliver a stunning picture and awesome sound. In Ridley Scott we trust, right?    But would is not would, but could! The blu-ray release here, is defect!    It has been processed by software that automatically removes fast moving objects. In the intro scene, a lot of arrows are missing flying in the air. The fireballs are distorted. Movements are distorted.     That's not all. The picture has boosted sharpness resulting in edge enhancement, halos around objects, making the scenes artificial looking. There are introduced digital noise reduction, that smoothers details in skin, textures, organic objects. You like wax faces, then by all means, buy.    That's not all. The extended cut scenes are fault free. So watching the extended cut, you will have the theatrical and extended cut scenes, mixed in, making the viewing seems like an even greater travesty.    I can not recommend this release to anyone. I watched this on a 104\\" screen and I would prefer to watch the DVD in upscaled form instead. The Braveheart title, also available on the Sapphire label is stunning. Really beautiful, but this one ... don't buy! It IS defect and Paramount have to strike a new master and redo this.
0679428895|1.0|The novel has many, many historical flaws that render the story implausible at best. One gets the impression that it was written for a quick read, quick sell, and then right to the big-screen. In view of its publication date following shortly on the heels of the hit movie \\"Gladiator,\\" one can almost see the author rushing to cash-in on the Roman \\"craze,\\" spawned by that movie. All that would be fine, a light-entertainment piece aimed at a mass-market audience; however, the author repeatedly boasts of his extensive historical research and accuracy in creating this novel, while persistently making gross historical errors throughout.   As other reviews have noted, the principle characters are thinly drawn, with modern viewpoints that have little relation to the era in which they are set. The protagonist, Attilius, condemns slavery (even as he makes use of it) in a civilization that was built on slavery and could not have existed without it. He somehow manages to deduce that Mt. Vesuvious is about to erupt, even though volcanic eruptions were totally unknown to the Romans of his time. Even the most scientific mind of his era (who figures prominently in the novel) Pliny the Elder, has no clue, but a simple aquatic engineer figures this out??? His love-interest Corelia's very name smacks of shoddy scholarship on the part of the author, who poses himself as an expert in Romanology. By Roman tradition, her name would be Ampliatia, after her father; the name \\"Corelia\\" has no connection to the girl's family, and thus is not an accurate Roman name. But perhaps the most annoying, and laughable mistake is also the most minute; everywhere in the novel, the characters are burning candles---yes, wax candles! One would think, with all of Mr. Harris's indepth research of Roman engineering, that he might have deduced that candles are a relatively modern invention, first appearing in the middle ages, virtually unknown to the ancient Romans. Might this be why not a single candle, candlestick, or candle holder was found in the ruins of Pompeii or Herculaneum? There's not a single Roman artifact indicating the use of wax candles for illumination; yet there are thousands upon thousands of oil lamps from the Roman era. This somehow escaped the author's attention. Exactly what kind of research did he conduct for his \\"meticulously\\" researched novel?

Sometimes when I need to I use my 50mm prime for portraits but most of the time I have this on.     Plasticity body but does feel solid, would have liked it to have more metal on it for $400. There is zoom creep when pointing extemely up or down especially when filters and hood are on. (does not come with a hood - again for $400 really should be part of the package).    Main objective is the picture quality which is very good. Sharp and well saturated with good contrast. I also like the fine focus adjustment ring - nice.    I think this was a good upgrade for the XTi, I do like using it and think it is a fair price when considering other options. For an extra 1 star should come with a hood and have no zoom creep and perhaps a bit more metal in the outer construction. One of the better non L lens.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made, far superior to the more recent make. Award-winning performances by Colin Firth and the man who played the minister. Everything was good in it, and the characterization, filming, plot, etc. was first rate. This movie should have been nominated as the best motion picture of the year. I do have one concern, however. The third time I watched the first of the two videos that make up the movie, the picture stopped briefly several times before continuing ... I hope these disks are sturdy because I'd like to watch this movie many more time. No wonder the Brits love it.
B00005B1W7|5.0|THE QUALITY OF THIS MINI SEARIES WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. THE PRICE WAS AGREABLE AND WHEN I FINALLY WATCHED IT I WAS SUPRIZED AT HOW INTENCE HOPKINS ACTING WAS NO WONDER HE IS SUCH A GREAT ACTOR.
B00004WG2F|2.0|I know this movie was meant to be a drama, but, honestly, how could anybody take it seriously? Three brothers fall in love with a sultry British beauty who somehow can rope a steer after being raised in Boston (that anomaly was never adequately explained, by the way). The reason they love her is obvious--she's the only available female in a 10,000-square-mile radius. The reason she loves them is a mystery. The youngest, Samuel, is an idiot. The eldest, Alfred,is a crashing bore. And Tristan is Brad Pitt. (Nuff said. Personally, I would have gone for Anthony Hopkins, who was the best man among 'em.) In short order, we have lust, betrayal, tragedy, guilt and estrangement.(All set to a soundtrack remarkably similar to the score of City Slickers.) \\"Years and years\\" pass, during which we have WWI, Prohibition, ranching, bears, congressional elections and various journeys to Africa, the South Seas and Crete (but, miraculously, nobody ages--except for Anthony Hopkins, who turns into an old man overnight). Eventually (if you can remember the plot after all that running around) the heart-warming bonds of blood (literally, in this case) overcome jealousy, and everybody hugs after a warm, reassuring burst of gunfire. The emotion-packed but manly reunion of the brothers and their stroke-ridden father over a pile of dead bodies brought tears to my eyes. I don't know when I've laughed so hard. (Now where are my shoes?)
0792160347|3.0|'Taxi Driver' writer Paul Schrader wrote and directed this film about a male escort named Julian (Richard Gere) who romances a senator's wife (Lauren Hutton) and gets framed for murder. Besides the Scorsese classic, this is Schrader's second biggest credit. I've only seen a couple of his films as director, but I prefer him more as a writer. That isn't to say he isn't skilled behind the camera since this film does an excellent job of portraying a cold and shallow world of excess and consumerism and the even colder people who live in it. The story is intriguing and makes for a very suspenseful film. You feel as helpless as Julian as you wonder who could be framing him and why. Gere and Hutton are both good looking and each appear nude in the film. The best work though comes courtesy of supporting players like Bill Duke and Hector Elizondo. Duke is frightening as a shady pimp who contracts Julian for jobs catering to the kinky crowd. It is one of his clients who winds up murdered, so Julian naturally goes to him for help. He proves to be anything but loyal for  a friend. The single funnest performance is that of Hector Elizondo as Det. Sunday. Elizondo, chewing the scenery along with a giant cigar, is a hoot in his scenes with Gere. Sunday is in awe of Julian's hypnotic hold over women. In a clever plot twist, Julian agrees to trade style and grooming advice with Sunday for more lenient care when he becomes a murder suspect. The film builds to a surprising climax as we figure out who the murderer is and what happens to Julian. Boasting plenty of coke, Armani suits, and an amazing score from Giorgio Moroder the film is pretty entertaining but not the iconic 80's film I was expecting.

0756405890|3.0|With hundreds of reviews and several customer discussions on its Amazon page, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" aroused my curiosity.  Some negative comments appeared calculated to smear while some positive comments seemed equally overdone.  I do not doubt there are both heart-felt one and five star reviews posted here, but isolated comments from both camps seemed disingenuous.  I had to see what all the fuss was about. (Congratulations to anyone who thought such disagreement and vitriol would help market the book... you got me!)    Of 722 total pages, I estimate that there were less than 200 pages of compelling narrative taken altogether.  Most were located in the latter half of the book.  It was not necessarily poorly written, there was just a lot of pointless detail.  Ignoring for a moment the overarching plot device of a legendary hero narrating his tale to a scribe, the narrative of the book can be reasonably broken down into the following sections: 1. Kvothe as a trouper with his family; 2. Kvothe as a street urchin in the large city of Tarbean; 3. Kvothe at the university.  The first two sections take almost 250 pages.  They could have been greatly abbreviated without any ill-effect to the story.  The final section also suffers from dead weight resulting in very slow pacing.    The first-person narrative introduced some difficulties for me.  Kvothe seems to dearly enjoy hearing himself talk.  Maybe as a hero it is his right, but he seems just a tad too pleased with himself at times.  Some quips were witty while others fell flat.  Some thoughts were inspiring while others were corny or self-evident.  He actually says, \\"Attend to me as I draw back the curtain to reveal a long-kept minstrel's secret...\\" (page 477).  Groan!  I wonder if Chronicler rolled his eyes.  He took himself and his tale a little too seriously at times.  In a few instances, Kvothe hints at a greater context or another anecdote but refuses to share it.  It felt like a bit of a cop out (planting a seedin the reader's mind without actually working for it; i.e., fully developing the narrative).    Another bitter pill for me was that a lot of the drama seemed forced or contrived.  Every time things were going well or smoothly, the rug would inevitably be pulled out from under Kvothe.  The tension did not seem to arise organically.  Instead, it felt like the author set him up just to knock him down again.    The characterizations suffered on a couple fronts.  Various characters were tired clichés (mean-spirited schoolmaster, haughty rich student) and others were not well developed.  Kvothe's two best friends at the university (and their relationships) seemed weakly established.    It appears to be en vogue of late for fantasy novelists to verbalize their conscious efforts to defy the conventions of the genre.  A theme throughout this book is that things did not occur neatly or tidily because this is not a story or fairy tale.  Yet it still read just the same to me.  Apparently telling us the story is not a story is no reliable means to escape the conventions.  This is not fantasy literature's first flawed hero or legendary figure who is revealed to be less than his image.    I struggled to finish the book.  It was only on my last day of reading that I decided to rate it at three stars instead of two.  There is some pretty good stuff here.  There's just a whole lot of frustrating nonsense you must be willing and prepared to wade through.  I honestly do not know if I will read the next installment(s).
0380715430|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable and thought provoking look at derivations of words and implications for the English language. Has heaps of examples linked by interesting narrative and tends to be selective and readable rather than comprehensive and dull. A 15 year-old friend enjoyed it too.
0446619078|4.0|Though The Last Coyote may not be as great as the book its following, The Concrete Blonde, it's got one hell of a great ending that I think pushes *the experience* of reading this ahead of that of Concrete Blonde. It's one of those situations where, if you talked to me mid-story, I'd think the book was good-but-flawed, but once I finished it I was amazed at what I'd just read and how Connelly manages to masterfully pull it together at the end.     This one delves deeper into main character Harry Bosch's personal life, his guilt, and other feelings. His life's pretty much in ruins, and he's been suspended from the force, leading him to attempt to solve the cold case of the murder of his mother while attending therapy sessions with the prison shrink. It's these therapy sessions where the book's at its worst, with a therapist character who seems more shrill and impatient than I think most therapists out there are and Harry, who feels these appointments are not worth his time, shuts himself off from them until late in the book; it all feels like a missed opportunity. A romance, too, comes out of left field and feels totally unnecessary.     Still, though, the mystery at the heart of this story and the way it plays out is intriguing, gripping, and has got quite a few surprises. The Coyote theme is also pretty noir-like and adds a great backdrop to what's easily the most down-and-out Harry's been to date. It's a great read and had the book cut down on the filler (like those therapy sessions and that romance) it would have been perfection, because the mystery at its center is very strong. I just wish it took center stage more often. Definitely recommended, though, because of the way it's all tied together.

B001RUXW48|2.0|This movie was so unconvincing. A trained CIA agent entrusted to an independent operation in the middle east even overpowering the director in Jordan is acting like a hot-blooded rookie (a girl friend in enemy territory, come on, like \\"hey, why don't you guys kidnap my girl friend to blackmail me!\\"  Muahahaha!!!), without calm, and without brains.  The CIA boss played by Russell Crowe was a waste of talent as well.  The role has no importance.  Appearance and decision made were also unreasonable and unnecessary. Comparing to the Bourne series, this one is totally laughable.
B00007GZR5|5.0|I loved this movie.  I saw it a long time ago.  One of Robin William's best.  Very profound.  I wanted it for my collection.  I got good service too and it came in good condition.
0375836675|4.0|Very captivating storyline and the characters in Ed's town are realistic. I've met many of them one way, one time or another. I found the behaviors and personal breakthroughs in this story to be highly valuable to go through in this kind of story. There are many statements and moments of great personal value to me. I wish I had read a story like this when I was just about to start highschool or even before. This should be required reading, but not through schools, through word of mouth among friends instead. This kind of book is something friends should get together in secrecy, in safety, to talk about. The messenger himself has some serious breakthroughs to evolve through and that so many wonderfully positive and simply events happen, with such repercussions, adds to the value of reading this story, of having this type of message delivered.     Some people have commented that the final revealing of the person sending out the cards is not created with the same satisfaction as the rest of the story, but I don't think they compare. The value of the book, the intrigue and interest and storyline do not in the end rely on that person being openly revealed at all, so I found it of minor interest, though at times I wondered if it was any of the characters revealed so far, and those thoughts brought in some good contemplations that Ed was rewarded with as well.     If you're in your teens or older, pick this book up and enjoy!

1400077915|3.0|There's no disputing that, when she's at the top of her form, Alice Munro writes beautifully. Unfortunately, some of the stories in this collection are disappointing and even banal.<br /><br />Much of this collection is taken up with three episodes in the life of Juliet Porteous, and the first two are superb, as Mrs. Munro displays her gift for creating realistic characters. In the third, Juliet's daughter joins a cult, then runs off, severing all contact with her loving mother, but whereas this drama could have been developed into something especially moving, we are instead offered but a few clues to the daughter's behavior, and the story plods on with descriptions of Juliet's quotidian activities, the procession of men she dates, and a disastrous analogy found in Greek mythology. It's as if Mrs. Munro simply became tired of writing and threw the remainder of the story together on a busy morning.<br /><br />The worst of the stories, \\"Tricks,\\" is pure bathos, and it's one of the shabbiest stories I've read by any writer of reputation. Young woman loses her purse and is stranded in a strange town. To the rescue comes a tall, dark stranger from a distant land. Instead of taking advantage of her virtue, the stranger pays her fare home, but with the condition that she return, wearing the same dress, in exactly one year. The agreement is sealed with a passionate kiss.<br /><br />It's a sort of Cinderella story, and the lass, smitten, dutifully follows her benefactor's command. Only, when she shows up at his home on the appointed date, he slams the door in her face. Naturally, she is heartbroken, but life goes miserably on, until one night, while working at a hospital, she discovers that she instead had been rejected by the benefactor's deaf-and-dumb twin brother.<br /><br />Well, that's so awful, it beggars the imagination, and I read that Mrs. Munro has been nominated for the Nobel Prize? Dismay. Dismay.<br /><br />Mrs. Munro doesn't seem to care much for dialogue. What dialogue there is is certainly adequate, but a typical page will have a short sentence of dialogue at the top, a short reply, then two long paragraphs of narrative and description.<br /><br />I expect that many of Mrs. Munro's devoted fans will be outraged by this assessment, and I confess that I may be prejudiced against all the Canadianisms in the book. How can one give serious consideration to people who refer to their electrical service by the ancient Greek word for water?dialogue there is is certainly adequate, but a typical page will have a short sentence of dialogue at the top, a short reply, then two long paragraphs of narrative and description.<br /><br />I expect that many of Mrs. Munro's devoted fans will be outraged by this assessment, and I confess that I may be prejudiced against all the Canadianisms in the book.

0756405890|5.0|I think I suffered a year of my cousin insisting I read this before it finally sunk into my head enough to warrant a memory during an Amazon shopping run.  When I finally received it, I must say I was impressed by the cover despite the old warning.  I read it and was immediately drawn into the incredible story of Kvothe.<br /><br />The strange thing is that there is so extraordinary reason for the appeal.  The story never goes out onto any imagination limbs.  There is nothing controversial.  Not a single deep decipher of human thought and behavior.  Honestly, with all due respect, the plot itself isn't unusually wondrous.<br /><br />At least I realized Mr. Rothfuss had managed to channel something still powerful in writing: a good & solid storytelling ability.  That above all is what makes this book such a keeper.  The writing is top-notch, the characters well-drawn without any annoying extremes.  Rothfuss knows his story and much more he knows how to write it.<br /><br />Rothfuss takes us into a world plausible as a time gone by, dotted by fairy tale demons and magic of a more scientific nature.  It's fun, intriguing, and somehow believable even with its eerie auras of a spooky bedtime story and a folksy tall-tale.<br /><br />The mix is marvelous, the story compelling.  I highly recommend it.
B00006AW2P|5.0|The value of this album, as a memento of the enormous impact the Stones had when they first burst upon the scene, has been amply confirmed by all and sundry here, by reviewers since 2002. I might add that, for me personally, the advent of the Stones blew the Beatles onto the backburner for ever. Lovely harmonies and weepy love sentiments were nice, but this was something else. Man, this was raw, this was adult stuff, and for a reason: most of it was written by lusty old musicians who spoke in a code about things forbidden by the \\"polite society\\" of their time. It would be a while before the white kids who first heard this figured out what \\"king bee\\" and the honey he was seeking were all about, and that \\"making love to you\\" didn't actually mean wooing a schoolgirl under the moonlight. What strikes me today is how well the album came out. There was so much snickering at the time, about none of these newfangled bands knowing how to play an instrument decently, and although the kids didn't care about that, they pretty much assumed it might be true. Well, not at all. For beginners, the boys had incredible chops. Although keith had only about three licks to his name, he did them with such abandon that they came out stellar - and don't forget that in the studio, where the screaming of girls doesn't cover your fumbling, it takes extra courage and several takes to get it right. In fact, listening to the albums that came after this one, you get the impression that he had already been made somewhat self-conscious and his solos were less adventurous in speed and just sheer reliance on luck. And no, in spite of the fact that the media had crowned Brian the geniuis of the band, he did not play those searing solos, Keith did. And while Bill's bass was yet to be given the prominence it deserved, here he already contributes to the incredibly percussive, bottom-smooth Stones sound, along with Charly. Ironically, Mick is perhaps the least Mick he would ever be. His passionate and affectless singing is on fire, but on \\"Can I Get a Witness\\" he's practically unrecognizable.<br />As for the virtues of the SACD version, well, there definitely are many, but they are subtle. Frankly, if you have the first version of the CD (1986, I think), you're fine too, save your dollars for a rainy day. As is very often the case with material from that era, you simply cannot create miracles out of crappy old tapes, remaster as you may: you raise the volume until your ears bleed, and inevitably, you can only do that because you have digital means of shaving off extreme top and bottom dynamics that would otherwise translate into distortion. But basically, it's the same product it always was - clearer and louder, but that is hardly the point with a primitive rocker from the sixties anyway, is it? Pandemonium is half the charm. I am thankful to the engineers for not attempting to polish this beyond recognition - the tape hiss on a few songs is worse than ever (on one song, you can hear tape deterioration), which is part of the remastering price, and they left it that way rather than massacre everything to obtain a pristine copy it was never meant to be.ctless singing is on fire, but on \\"Can I Get a Witness\\" he's practically unrecognizable.

0307277453|5.0|This is a true \\"journey\\" into our deepest origins brilliantly blending findings in paleonthology, anatomy, genetics and embriology with captivating personal accounts. Meant for the layperson, it explains several principles of the areas studied by developmental biology (genetics and embriology) in a way that is both simple but with enough details and explanations to understand it. If you would like to get an understanding of Evo-Devo (evolutionary developmental biology), read this book as an introduction, then you can turn to other books like [[ASIN:0393327795 Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo]]. Although Mr. Caroll's book is also very good and explains other truly interesting aspects of evolution, I had the feeling that he skipped some steps in the explanation (or probably thought they were obvious to everybody).     Besides of gaining a better understanding of the physical and genetic transformations occurred in our journey from fish to amphibians to reptiles to mammals, specially in regards with our limbs and skulls in relation to our sensory organs and what we sense like smell, vision and hearing, you will enjoy the paleontologists field trips. You will learn that the success of such an expedition relies heavily on the planning and on everything you have to consider to pick the site, but then a lot is serendipity. Each chapter gives you a surprise, lots of new Info and \\"a-ha\\" moments (at least to a layperson like myself).    The afterword in my edition was about what was discovered after the publication of the book and the last field trip to the site where \\"Tiktaalik\\" was found. The picture the author chose for publishing was one showing the camp laying in isolation in the arctic vastness on a snowy day. It turned me \\"nostalgic\\" at the thought of the scientists saying good bye to the site after several years of going there and sad that the book's adventures had come to an end. This book was truly enjoyable, informative and with very good editing.

0385342020|2.0|Disappointing is how I'd sum up this book. I am a huge fan of the author and have loved several of her books, but not this one I'm afraid. The premise, which seemed cute and had promise, just wasn't executed well. Sadie the ghost was so annoying that I skimmed half the book to get through those scenes. The only interesting bits were the ones focused on headhunting and the love interest, Ed. I'll also add that I am a headhunter, and if I ever treated a client the way the heroine treated hers, I'd be out of business.    I hope this book was a one-off, and she'll go back to creating better books in the style of Undomestic Goddess and Can You Keep a Secret.

0670033375|2.0|Don't be misled by the title. And don't buy this book if you have absolutely no interest in reading HUNDREDS OF PAGES about the social minutiae of why Vikings couldn't raise potatoes.    Jared Diamond is absolutely THE authority on the endless seemingly trivial micro-dynamics and the detailed analysis of the lifestyles of ancient cultures that makes up this very thick book. But why ANYONE would care to read about how some ancient Greenland society dealt with soil erosion is beyond me.     Although it still gathers dust next to my bed, I'm hoping (if I ever DO get to the last few pages of this hard-to-hold dictionary sometime in the distant future) that there will be some sort of final assessment of how all this ENDLESS stuff that I have been reading about can be tied together to show how TODAY'S cultures should pay closer attention to what they're doing (although I suspect it won't).    Intensely academic. A true stellar research piece. But since NOTHING in this book so far can be applied to why TODAY'S cultures seem to be collapsing (I can't seem to come up with any societies that are still hollowing logs out to build boats...) and that the title describes my interest level, unless you want to feel like your trying to stay awake n one of those classes in college that you HAD to take to get credit, look for something a little more directly applicable to today's conditions.

And as things build to a climax, you are swept away with it. This is an important story and really, like Schindler's List, everyone should see it. We must never forget what happened during the holocaust. Rent this film if you aren't sure. But I recommend that you buy this film and watch it annually.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385751893 The Boy In the Striped Pajamas (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Random House Movie Tie-In Books)]]<br />[[ASIN:B001N26GFM The Boy in the Striped Pajamas]]<br />[[ASIN:B00246VKGG The Boy in the Striped Pajamas Classroom Edition [Interactive DVD]]][[ASIN:B001KVZ698 The Boy in the Striped Pajamas [Blu-ray]]]

B000FQJAIW|3.0|The Movie:  Star Wars is a classic movie that will impress generations with its majestic good vs. evil story. The movie itself deserves 10 out of Amazon's 5 stars. People will always love this timeless movie.    Background:  As most Star Wars fans know, George Lucas decided in the 1990s that technology has finally caught up with his vision. He re-released it in theaters in 1997 with these new effects and called it Star Wars: Special Edition. Of course, Lucas caused controversy by deciding to make the Special Edition definitive and deciding to never release the original unaltered award-winning version. In 2004, George Lucas released an even more improved Star Wars (Super Special Edition). Because the unaltered version was not released on DVD, bootlegs containing transfers from the laserdiscs got spread. George Lucas finally relented and released the unaltered version on DVD in 2006. It was named by fans George Original Unaltered Trilogy (GOUT).    Technical:  Unfortunately, Star Wars GOUT is not sourced from a new high definition transfer as some expected. Instead, it is sourced from a 1993 laserdisc master with an original crawl ironically from the best film in existence. This release is non-anamporphic and uses the stereo laserdisc audio instead of the original theatrical audio. It looks terrible on a widescreen TV. It is however better than most bootlegs because it is sourced not from a laserdisc copy but the laserdisc master. The opening crawl sourced from the best film begs the question why George Lucas did not source GOUT from the anamporphic best film and rayher chose to source it from the laserdisc master. Additionally, GOUT is not the main movie but instead a bonus feature disc of another release of the Star Wars: Super Special Edition. Compared to the Super Special Edition's quality, GOUT is an outrage. Basically, GOUT is the least George Lucas could do to release the original unaltered trilogy without being worse quality than the bootlegs.
0545123267|2.0|Ok, so I read the first few chapters of Shiver, and thought it was totally interesting and I had to read it.  I liked that each chapter changed the POV from Sam a werewolf to Grace the girl he loves.  And it tells you the temperature at the beginning of each chapter too, because Sam changes in the cold, so it's important.  It was going along fine, then got very slow at the halfway point. And it shouldn't have! There was plenty of story to choose from. Between new rouge/bully wolf Jack, missing friends, first times and betralys this should've been a thrill ride. But, truth be told, I just skimmed the last quarter of it. It was whinny and boring, and it may just be me, but does anyone else cringe when someone shows you a song they wrote? It's either sappy or aweful and usually a combo of both.  (This book's full of them!) I wanted a fun look at werewolves and the gals who love them. But all I got here, was a sappy, pathetic emo-love ballad.  Pass
0780631684|5.0|Final Destination has an interesting concept. Death hunts people who overcame his plan for them. A script originally written for X-Files, it is intelligent, cerebral, and witty. It is not your average \\"kill-teens\\" flick. Each teen has their own personality and you can actually tell the difference between all of them. You sympathize with the teens and hope they don't die; instead of rooting for the killer (in this case Death itself). The teens have actual intelligence and are not idiots. The cliffhanger ending is truly excellent.  Among the Final Destination series, this is the best. Final Destination 2 (second best) suffered (in my opinion) from a relatively happy, hopeful ending compared to this cliffhanger ending; the new life concept seemed too hopeful. The Final Destination (third best) was relatively good but suffered from \\"show everybody die and not leave mystery\\" syndrome. Final Destination 3 suffered from stupid characters who no one cares about syndrome.
1439157383|4.0|Ms. Picoult is an amazing writer to begin with, so it is no surprise she has created another beautifully touching story that truly speaks to the heart.<br /><br />  My Sister's Keeper is about a young girl diagnosed with cancer at a young age. After many long months of various treatments, it is announced that Kate will not live unless she can receive help from someone else. Jesse, her older brother, is not a match. Nor is her parents (Sara and Brian). She has limited time and to wait for a random donor is risky. They have one other option. Their other child. The only problem is she doesn't exist yet. After much consideration, they decide to have another child for the purpose of saving their elder daughter.<br />  Fast forward 13 years. Anna, the younger daughter, is a teenager. She is bright, curious and free-spirited but she is tired of going through surgery after surgery, hoping that each one will guarantee Kate a few years. She sues her parents for medical emancipation with the help of Campbell Alexander. It is a selfish act... or so it seems.<br /><br /> While Sara was not exactly likable, I think we all see parts of ourselves in these complex characters. Kate grows from an outgoing child to a strong young woman with the help of Anna and her family.  I have always liked how Jodi Picoult alternates view points and time periods, In some cases, it might confuse us, the readers, but in this particular work of fiction, it adds a twist on the sometimes predictable characters.<br /><br />  My Sister's Keeper teaches us that sometimes the line between right and wrong, good and bad, and moral and immoral are blurred. And sometimes, there is no right answer.
B001AR0D4A|2.0|(spoilers) Why would characters that fought for survival through the entire movie give up right at the end?    If the car had been under attack by creatures and there was genuinely no escape then the ending would have made some kind of sense, but the car was just sitting in the middle of who knows where with no discernable threat outside. In fact since they left the supermarket they hadn't encounter any kind of threat from any creatures. So why would they give up and not (at the very least) see if there was any kind of actual threat outside, or (for Christ sakes) why didn't they just wait to see what happens next?!?    Why didn't they think of other alternative, like maybe they could have looked for another car, or maybe there was a house nearby, or maybe another vehicle would pass by, or maybe if there are no creatures outside they could have gotten out and walked?    The creators of this movie in the race to give us a shock ending seem to have left their brains behind and boy do I wish they had filmed an alternative ending (that made sense) and if they did film an alternative ending, why didn't they put it on the Blu-ray and give viewers a choice of which ending they want to see? If there was ever a film that needed an alternative ending it was this one.    I've never seen a movie go from a 'must buy' to a 'must avoid' like this one did.

B000WCBPOG|4.0|Don't let the title fool you, this IS an amazing soundtrack.  My problem is I wanted the MOVIE VERSIONS of the songs.  These are NOT the songs from the movie, they are separate studio recordings.  Kind of disappointing, I absolutely loved these songs in the movie, then when I got the soundtrack it just wasn't what I expected.  And Eddie Izzards version of \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\"  sucks, I just have to say that.  All in all, it's a good CD, but I wish I could rip the songs direct from the movie instead.
B002CPD5LC|5.0|Quincy Jones has had one heck of a career! Older jazz fans know him from his years as trumpeter and arranger for Dizzy Gillespie, sixties rock and roll fans know him from all the hits he produced with Lesley Gore and - of course - everyone knows him from his work on the mega-platinum albums of Michael Jackson. He even worked with early hip-hop artists with his \\"Back On The Block\\" CD - still one of my favorites.<br /><br />Jones is highly respected in every pop and jazz genre and has fostered young musicians with his involvement in school music programs and with scholarships.<br /><br />This beautifully crafted - once-in-a-lifetime concert - was organized by Montreux Jazz Festival founder Claude Nobs - in July 2008 and features, not only well know artists who Jones has worked with over his career - a literal \\"who's who\\"  including, Al Jarreau, Toots Theilmans, James Moody, Nana Mouskouri, Petula Clark, Chaka Kahn and the incredible Patti Austin  - who in my opinion steals the show! It concert must have lated longer, but its edited here down to THREE HOURS! The combinations of performers is unique: Herbie Hancock, with Patti Austin vocalizing on the theme from the film \\"The Good , The Bad and the Ugly\\" start it off and later Miss Austin joins Miss Kahn for \\"Miss Celie's Blues\\" from the film \\"The Color Purple\\". (Oh did I mention that Jones composed lots of film scores, including this one? Michael Jackson was not in attendance at the party so All Jarreau and the a capella group Naturally 7, handle his hits. The camera work is excellent - as it usually is on the Montreux Jazz DVDs from Eagle Vision and there's a nice 48-page booklet of photos and tributes included. (They could have used some of those pages to discuss Q's career, but that's just a minor quibble.<br /><br />The guy is still producing and making great music at age 76.

1580176941|5.0|I received this book as a gift; I did not buy it (because goodness knows, I don't NEED another cookie book!).  I've been decorating cookies for many years, but I did read this book from cover to cover.  And I have to admit I was quite impressed with it.  The authors very thoughtfully laid out the precise step by step procedures anyone (even a beginner) would need to make the beautiful cookies displayed in this book.  It's a quality book that is very well made and nicely bound.  At Amazon's price, it is VERY reasonable.  From an inspirational standpoint alone, the pages of clear, beautifully detailed pictures, make the book worth every penny!  There's nothing worse than owning a plain outline cutter with no thoughts on how to decorate!  And the authors make suggestions of other ways you might use your cutters for different events.  As for the reviewers who were upset it was not a \\"recipe book\\", the title alone exactly describes what type of book it is.  But the authors DO include their tried and true recipes so anyone can achieve wonderful results every time.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|I was never a huge X-Men fan, but I enjoyed the first three X-Men movies. Between Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, and Hugh Jackman, they had a strong cast that made the movies slightly more than just an adaptation of a comic book.     X-Men Origins: Wolverine has a lot going for it. It has a good soundtrack, strong acting (Hugh Jackman is really raw), and the effects pretty good. Unfortunately, X-Men Origins: Wolverine doesn't rise to the level of its predecessors. For whatever reason, focusing solely on Wolverine/Hugh Jackson just doesn't work as well - he's just not the most interesting of superheroes (too noble and mysterious in my opinion).     Furthermore, rather than having the powerful McKellan as the villain Magneto, X-Men Origins: Wolverine pits Wolverine against an ambitious U.S. Army colonel who looks pathetically like Dan Akroyd. The other characters don't really strengthen the movie either and seem second-rate compared to the heavy hitters in the prior films, such as Storm (Halle Berry), Beast (Kelsey Grammar), etc.     I think anybody who enjoys action movies will like Wolverine. However, its appeal will be much more limited than the prior 3 X-Men films.

159448385X|1.0|I did not read THE KITE RUNNER nor did I see the film. I knew the subject matter of A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS before I purchased the book so I was prepared for the story. I'm a bit mystified as to why so many people believe this book is \\"lyrical,\\" \\"not to be missed,\\" \\"outstanding,\\" etc., etc., and all the other platitudes associated with it. Color me stupid, but I didn't think the writing was inventive or creative or even interesting. It's not bad writing, but it certainly isn't great by any means. The story reads like the first draft of a screenplay that's been turned into a novel. It seems the author invented scenarios for a sweeping historical saga that would look good on the screen, but completely failed to bring the characters to life in the novel.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it's not over the top given the Afghan culture and how women can be treated; rather, there are some serious plot points (or rather plot holes) that do not make any sense (e.g., the ages of Mariam's father and Rasheed; how did they get away successfully the second time, but not the first; why wait so long between the first and second attempts to leave Rasheed; etc.) . As hard as life was for Mariam, I could not feel her pain or empathize with her situation. Honestly, here, I think Mr. Hosseini failed with the female voices - most of it did not seem truthful or \\"real.\\" It felt artificial and contrived. The early relationship between the young Laila and the young Tariq reads like a bad romance novel.<br /><br />When Mr. Hosseini incorporates the rise of the Taliban into his story, I did not find it believable or involving. It was merely a plot device (unfortunately) to move the story along. Somewhere out there is a great historical novel/story about the rise of the Taliban and its affect on Afghanistan women, but this isn't the book.

At his best, McCann invites the reader into a world as real as their own and, yet, so very different. Oh, how I would enjoy spending an afternoon with some of McCann's characters! From laugh-out-loud moments to very real sadness, McCann's world was indeed spinning and, in spite of some turbulence along the way, I didn't want to get off. We're all entitled to our opinions but I, for one, hope you won't allow the negative reviews to keep you from reading this wonderful, life-affirming book.
0345404475|5.0|My mission, should I decide to accept it, is to review this Philip K. Dick novel with little or no reference to \\"Blade Runner\\", the movie it inspired.  Here we go.<br /><br />Bad news first - even more than most of PKD's classic work, \\"Electric Sheep\\" explains everything to you.  It's full of historical data, telling you that in the future of its setting, war has left clouds of radioactive dust all over creation, endangering the mentality and reproductive health of pretty nearly every human on the planet.  Most have decided to emigrate to an off-planet colony before the dust destroys their bodies and renders them unqualified.  As a result, Earth has become severely underpopulated.<br /><br />As an additional incentive, each new colonist receives a highly advanced android, or \\"andy\\", as a companion.  So human-like are these androids that only a postmortem bone-marrow test can identify them positively, but an empathy test administered by a qualified policeman does almost as well, because androids have no empathy at all.  This makes them dangerous, and they are restricted to the off-Earth colonies - if any of them get to Earth, usually by means of murder, a police bounty hunter hunts them down and \\"retires\\" them.<br /><br />Empathy has also become the linchpin of a new religion called Mercerism.  By means of an electronic \\"empathy box\\", most of the humans on and off Earth \\"join\\" with the ancient prophet Wilbur Mercer as he tries to escape from those who deal in death.  Mercer also loved animals, so his followers demonstrate their dedication by caring for an animal of some sort.  Unfortunately,  radioactivity has killed off most of Earth's animals, so those who can't find or afford one resort to artificial copies, such as the electric sheep of the title.<br /><br />Clear?  If PKD had tried to communicate all of this by traditional fictional means, his novel would have been two or three times longer.  Nevertheless, \\"Electric Sheep\\" unquestionably deserves its place among the man's greatest work, not only because of its powerful structure and emotional punch, which I'll get to in a minute, but also for one other interesting reason.  Whereas in some of his other work screwball details hang around to no discernable purpose, \\"Electric Sheep\\" integrates its screwball detail into the story proper.<br /><br />The novel opens on the police bounty hunter Rick Deckard as he gets ready for his day, a procedure that includes dialing the proper mood for himself on a Penfield Mood Organ.  His wife Iran insists upon dialing a suicidal depression for herself, and the Deckards spend all of Chapter One arguing over this.  Which is cute, but it also tells you something about Deckard's background and relationships, what he might be looking for and not getting, where he's vulnerable and where he could use some maturing.  All of this echoes down the rest of his day - \\"Electric Sheep\\" is one of those comparatively few PKD novels with a restricted structure.  It takes place over not much more than one 24-hour period, and it begins and ends in the same location.<br /><br />That's a very good idea on PKD's part, especially for a novel with so much expository language (a big no-no according to most writing teachers).  What's more, as you might guess from Deckard's occupation as a police bounty hunter, \\"Electric Sheep\\" follows the broad outlines of a police procedural - his assignment is to locate and retire six escaped andys, more than almost anyone has done in one day.  The job is complicated by the fact that some of those andys have found an ally in JR Isidore, one of those disqualified from emigration because of the damage done to his intellect by the radioactive dust.  He's sensitive to any overture of friendship because of his intellectual status and because, the world being underpopulated, he lives all alone in a huge apartment building slowly collapsing into \\"kipple\\", undifferentiated discards that seem to fill up empty space unless actively controlled.  Any apartment dweller knows all about that, and it's one of PKD's glories that he invented a word for the stuff.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Isidore, and Deckard too, it's beyond question that androids are in fact incapable of empathy, of identifying with others and comprehending their lives.  They abandon each other in danger, torture animals out of curiosity, and sacrifice humans at the merest hint of trouble.  (Of course, there are humans who do that, too, and there's something dangerously innocent about PKD's assumption that empathy is a universal human characteristic, but it's his book.)  More to the point, although this lack of empathy makes the androids dangerous, it also makes Deckard's job all the more devastating to his conscience once he discovers that, as a human, he has feelings of empathy for the androids.  Can he eliminate the android threat and still retain his own humanity?  Never mind dangling from a tall building like Harrison Ford - that's a problem.<br /><br />This is where the emotional wallop comes in.  Some authors can divide their characters into heroes and villains without a twitch.  PKD never mastered that trick, especially not here.  The prophet Mercer is a fictional construct, but the author seems to have taken him very seriously.  He gives Mercer one commandment and one only - \\"You shall kill only the killers\\" - but he knows perfectly well that doing so takes a lot out of good people.<br /><br />Like most other PKD work, though, \\"Electric Sheep\\" closes on a note of hope - of \\"long-deserved peace\\", in fact, through that Penfield Mood Organ.  And more importantly, the empathy that's been missing from an important relationship gets strengthened.<br /><br />Well, that's PKD for you.  He's the sort who would start out to write a crime thriller and end with his characters becoming better people for their trip through the valley of despair.  Like the characters, you finish this adventure and breathe a sigh of relief.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Love isn't easy, just vital.and it's one of PKD's glories that he invented a word for the stuff.

B001GCUO4I|2.0|The first three films in this series were nothing great, but they had decent scripts and some very unique kills. The kills are what really kept this franchise going, but the ones in Final Destination 4 lack the imagination of the others. There is no mystery this time around (the trailers and TV ads showing way too much didn't help) because it is just so obvious how someone is going to die. The script, dialogue and acting are really bad, even for this kind of flick. I mean it didn't seem like anyone was even trying. If you don't mind paying a few dollars more, the only saving grace is the 3-D. Having body parts and tools of death flying at you from all directions is pretty cool. I wouldn't even think about watching this movie in regular 2-D. I wish I could be more positive, but death should have found this series before this newest release, though I have a feeling plenty more people will be sliced and diced in Final Destination 5 and beyond.<br /><br />2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars (for the two hot chicks and some neat looking 3-D deaths)
B0026NWBY2|5.0|Let It Roll is a fabulous summation of the late George Harrison's musical influence. The \\"Quiet Beatle\\" always contributed more to the group than he ever got credit for.  His guitar playing, his vocal harmonies and his occasional writing were integral parts of what made the Beatles the greatest group ever.  This CD really showcases his greatest hits and does so in a way that showcases his variety of musical styles, his way with a \\"hook\\" and the deep personal beliefs that he put into his songs.  Great CD for old fans and a real treat for the un-initiated.

B001NFNFNA|4.0|I agree with the editorial review and several viewers that the movie should have ended with the discovery of the grisly murders of twenty young children by a madman. Every story reaches a climax, and here we have one or two too many. We don't have to witness the execution and the rantings of the hanged man, or Christine's new \\"hope.\\" UP to that point, however, the movie is as compelling, gruelling, and, strangely, inspiring, showing not just a mother's but a woman's fight for justice. Jolie is first rate, and so is John Malcovich in one of his rare sympathetic roles (he can play a non-detestable character given a chance). Admirably directed by Eastwood, who shows that movies can be both entertaining and also embracing important social causes. \\"Epic, taut, twisty and compellling,\\" writes Richard Corliss of of Time Magazine. It is all that, but much more. For teachers of film, place it it in your curriculum, in a class dedicated to film as social cause. Too many disappearances of young people of late remind you of the suprememe importance of learning about paranoid psychopaths--no less than about cases of corrupt officials.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I'm the worst movie critic alive. This movie gets two thumbs up. My favorite line in it is: \\"Get busy livin' or get busy dyin\\". So very true, no matter your situation. Not suitable for viewers under 14.
B000E1ZK50|5.0|This film is great fun and a great re-imaging of the venerable old vampire expert into a nineteenth century super hero.  Jackman is the perfect choice for this role, and one would hope that there's enough room in his busy schedule to periodically lend his talents to the continuation of this complex character.  The special effects and art direction in this film were superb, and the world created is ripe for further story plunder.  Excellent vampire/supernatural fun.

That reviewer knows little about how this movie is supposed to look.  Not every blu-ray is \\"supposed\\" to look like Crank or Pirates of the Caribbean.  He probably thought the Godfather looked bad on blu-ray, too.  12 Monkeys looks exactly how it should on blu-ray and probably the best it will ever look.    Also, what most casual blu-ray fans/reviewers never mention is the lossless audio - I'm guessing because they don't even know what that is, and they're the same people that thought forever they were watching HD because they owned an HDTV, or the people that think they're getting a deal by spending only $70 on an HDMI cable on sale at Best Buy.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 track is a huge step up over whatever lossy track the DVD and HD DVD offered.    Don't hesistate to grab this.  It's reasonably priced with a well-done transfer and great audio - strong use of surround sound and a crystal clear lossless track.

B000WS4QJG|5.0|Before I go into the review of this wonderful masterpiece of a album,I would like to ask a question: How long do you think it will take for people to get over MJ?...1 year,2 years,5 YEARS,for me it would take a lifetime.Its only been over 2 months,but everyday that goes by seems like yesterday(meaning fresh)like it just happened.This album will make people remember(the ones who are big fans of Micheal Jackson)the day we all sat around the tv watching MTV seeing the first MJ video on a world premier and the day MJ broke the MTV race barrier.MJ worked too hard for the world and people should always remember the endless contributions and services he did while he was here and not all the negative things the media said.    On to the review,I loved this album and many will too.Will i am,Fergie and Kayne West paying their tributes which puts the cherry on top makes this album a solid gold masterpiece.I give it 10 stars and I hope his movie make its mark too - R.I.P. \\"King of Pop\\" MJ!!!!!
1416562605|1.0|I picked this book up by Arvind Adiga for a vacation read this August.  Unlike other books which I pick up which are either due to word-of-mouth or great reviews, I picked this one up because it won the Man Booker award in the U.K.<br /><br />I was prepared to accept the book to be not my cup of tea at the worst or a delicious read at best.  What I was not prepared was that I would end up questioning the quality of books that the Man Booker committee is reviewing and putting up for awards!<br /><br />As novels go this book was thin on plot, worse on characterization and the language was positively jarring.<br /><br />My objection to this novel is not because of the subject (taking the point of view of the underclass), or the topic (corruption) or the plotline (finding a way out of a harsh social trap); rather my objection is to the quality of the work which is characterized by inauthentic situations and laughable coincidences and plot twists.<br /><br />And the whole writing the letter to the Chinese Premier...what was that all about?<br /><br />Luckily I finished this puppy up in one train ride (one-way).

055358894X|5.0|To fans of Charles Dickens' timeless classic \\"Oliver Twist\\", at least the opening scenes of Scott Lynch's ground-breaking epic debut novel will seem familiar. Locke Lamora, an impoverished, hungry orphan on a distant world reminiscent of medieval Venice, is captured off the streets and sold into servitude to the Eyeless Priest, a thief and con who, like Fagin, feeds and houses his crew of urchins while teaching them to live off the avails of thievery.<br /><br />Lamora's precociousness, his easy-going flamboyance, his skill and intelligence, his artistry and imaginative ability to craft rock solid confidence games, his audacity and cock-sure bravado combined with his obvious love of life ensure that when the Eyeless Priest passes on, he falls naturally into the role of leadership of a group of best friends and clever cons who style themselves \\"The Gentlemen Bastards\\".<br /><br />Lamora's plans to fleece the nobility out of their wealth put him into a difficult conflict with \\"the secret peace\\", an unwritten truce that exists between the Duke of Camorr and Capa Raza, the de facto ruler of all of the gangs including, of course, \\"The Gentlemen Bastards\\". Basically, crime is accepted and the local constabulary looks the other way provided, of course, the crime is directed at only the common people and the nobility are left alone.<br /><br />When a shadowy character known only as \\"The Grey King\\" assassinates Capa Raza and usurps his position as the local crime boss, Lamora and the rest of his gang find themselves truly between a rock and a hard place. Now they are hunted by both the Duke's secret police, The Midnighters, and the Grey King's relentless enforcers that include, among other things, a powerful mage and an all-seeing fierce pet falcon with poisoned claws!<br /><br />It is difficult to say enough good things about this incredible novel without appearing to actually froth at the mouth!<br /><br />Characterization is positively brilliant and every character seems to be developed to such an astonishing degree as to actually leap off the page and into reality in the minds of the reader. I won't spoil the story by saying who dies, but when a couple of the good guys meet their nemesis, the characters have been so firmly built in the psyche of the reader that the effect is positively devastating!<br /><br />Dialogue also deserves a full set of superlative compliments! Ranging from hilarious, comical strings of vulgar, medieval profanities that would make a longshoreman blush to upper crust court-speak that would be the envy of a Shakespeare in full blossom, Lynch's dialogue shows he is a master of conveying his story through conversation as well as descriptive narrative. And his descriptive abilities, by the bye, are not exactly low key either. Camorr is brought fully to life and Lynch's readers will have no trouble at all picturing a fully-realized jam-packed setting as his characters move from place to place in this fast-paced story.<br /><br />Hie thee to the purveyor of fine books closest to thy hand and, with all due haste, read \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\", a picaresque fantasy of epic proportions in a gorgeous medieval setting. It's not mere hyperbole to suggest that this is the most exciting book I've read for quite some time.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weissegree as to actually leap off the page and into reality in the minds of the reader.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I really love this album. It's a personal look at her childhood, relationships with the opposite sex, people taking advantage of her in many ways, etc. This album surpasses her debut cd lyrically, musically, vocally and artistically. This is her greatest album in my opinion. A lot of people misinterpreted what she meant by the album being called stripped. It was to be more personal about things she actually experienced. She didn't want to pick other people's songs and sing them. She was more hands on with putting this record together the way she wanted it, not the record label.
B000SMWUPS|3.0|We got this organizer to use with our Joovy Ergo Caboose.  It has a nice amount of room for cell phone, water bottles, keys, etc. and the zippered pocket is a plus. I was disappointed, however, when one of the straps popped off when I put a not-unreasonable amount of pressure on the organizer.  I've only had it in place for five days!  Seems to me that, even for $10, this should hold up better than that.  I am in Sweden and am unable to get a replacement easily, so I had a tailor fix it--for $9!  Could have just as easily bought another one for that.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|The original Swivel Sweeper works extremely well on hard floors. It's light weight and swivel to get around tight crevices. It also does a fairly decent cleaning job right up against the wall on hard floors and even carpets. Although for carpet cleaning in the central area of the room, you're better off using a conventional vacuum cleaner for that. The reason for this, that this sweeper is not a vacuum but a power brush system that would only get the surface dust off the carpet leaving the ground in dust.<br /><br />We bought this sweeper to use on hard floors prior to washing them. For that function it does extremely well, keeping the mop relatively lint free. For use on carpeting, you have to be careful that you don't cause the sweeper to flip and spilling the contents back onto the carpet. Since this kind of sweeper with no suction doesn't clean ground in dirt well on carpeting, I would not recommend it for this purpose.<br /><br />we bought the original Swivel Sweeper as well as the improved Swivel Sweeper G2. When comparing the two, they both clean equally well. The Swivel Sweeper G2 is a little bit more convenient to use because of the refinement such as easier emptying as well as the articulating handle when you need to go underneath furniture. other then the convenient enhancement, both machines cleans equally well. I highly recommend either machine for use around the house on hard floors in place of a broom and dust pan.<br /><br />Final thoughts: For maximum battery longevity,it is best to run the batteries down to a certain degree before recharging. When recharging, be sure to charge more than eight hours but no more than 24 hours maximum. The nickel metal hydride battery pack is consists of six cells. This type of battery shouldn't have any memory effect unlike nickel cadmium ones. My personal feeling is based on past experience that most of these types of products generally use low quality batteries that may not last very long. When the battery wears out, I may consider rebuilding it with higher quality nickel metal hydride cells.ding it with higher quality nickel metal hydride cells.
B001KZVQJI|2.0|It seems self-evident that any work of art is a product of its time. It also seems self-evident that there's no point in remaking a movie unless there was something wrong with the original, or you've found a new way to approach the material. (David Lynch's rework of \\"The Fly\\" meets both critieria very well. Ditto for \\"The Thing\\" which is not so much a remake as a \\"make\\".) The problem with Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" redo is that there's no way to \\"improve\\" on one of the greatest films ever made, without changing it beyond recognition.<br /><br />To see the original \\"King Kong\\" as a technologically dated exercise that would have been \\"so much better\\" if only it had been made 70 years later, is to miss the way that the medium and the message * were inextricably linked in 1932. For example...<br /><br />The scene in which we hear the unseen Kong tramping through the trees to Max Steiner's music, suddenly appearing in front of the screaming Ann, scares the s*** out of children (and not a few adults). It's one of the great cinematic moments, its effectiveness deriving from its in-your-face crudity. (No offense to Willis O'Brien or the Delgado brothers -- quite the opposite.) The original Kong wasn't a giant gorilla, but a horrifying id-monster portrayed by a frighteningly ugly stop-motion puppet.<br /><br />In converting Kong into a realistic animal, Jackson has, at a single stroke, discarded the horrific and dream-like/nightmare elements that made the original a classic. Realism is not fundamentally frightening or horrific. If you don't understand this, watch \\"Nosferatu\\" or \\"Vampyr\\".<br /><br />This realism, in turn, greatly weakens the original's \\"beauty and the beast\\" conceit. Ann's affectionate response to the big lug relects a late-20th-century view, fostered by NatGeo specials, that gorillas are intelligent, affectionate creatures -- not ugly, brutal, or automatically threatening. Fay Wray's Ann screamed her head off, overwhelmed by fear she would be killed or devoured. Naomi Watts' Ann, though frightened, sees Kong as a misunderstood critter. \\"Who could ever learn to love a beast?\\" Well, when you love a beast -- he's not a beast any more.<br /><br />This is the film's fundamental error of re-conception -- Kong is no longer a rampaging monster, brought to his knees by Ann's irresistable European blondness. ** He is now a monster only in size, munching on bamboo, rather than Ann. The original Kong was a brutal beast throughout the story, allowing us a moment of cathartic pity when he's killed. The new Kong, sympathetic throughout, doesn't evoke this contrast of emotions. \\"It was beauty killed the beast\\" no longer makes much sense.<br /><br />In describing the sacrificial maidens as \\"brides\\" of Kong, the original makes the not-so-subtle suggestion that Kong \\"molests\\" his victims before killing and eating them. (Kong's ripping off Ann's clothes to sniff them supports this, though Cooper and Schoedsack said they'd put this in because seen wild monkeys smelling human clothes.) But the new version has Ann showing a great deal of affection for Kong -- an affection which, if carried too far, would suggest beastiality, with Ann the perpetrator.<br /><br />Another major failing *** is that \\"economy of expression\\" are not words in Jackson's vocabulary. He can't resist overdoing /everything/, simply because it's doable. If the original had /one/ disgusting creature, Jackson has three or ten or fifty. The scene in which Kong is gassed and Ann bids him \\"farewell\\" is ludicrously drawn-out and overdone, the restored \\"spider pit\\" sequence is -- like my movie reviews -- numbingly overlong **** -- and then there's the allosaur battle. I won't describe it, because I don't want to spoil your incredulous laughter at its utter preposterousness. It was at this point that whatever sympathy I had for the remake vanished.<br /><br />The original was a model of terseness, starting slowly, but never stopping once it got up to speed. ***** The remake is not only overlong, but overwrought. Individual scenes and sequences run on for two or three times any reasonable length, to the point where the audience (this viewer, anyway) screams \\"Get on with it!\\".<br /><br />Jackson's pacing isn't so hot, either. Cooper knew when to pause briefly, then pick up again. The first hour of Jackson's version (which is actually quite good) shows that he (mostly) understands \\"structure\\" and \\"pace\\", but the rest of the film is a hotch-potch of action scenes, without any sense of development or \\"build\\".<br /><br />It's understandable that Jackson didn't want to exactly repeat the original, but too many iconic scenes have been lost, which seems inexcusable in a three-hour film: Kong smelling Ann's clothes; Kong choosing the wrong woman from the hotel, then throwing her to the street; Kong destroying the elevated train (Jackson's destruction of a street car doesn't come close to Cooper's \\"German expressionist\\" treatment). On the other hand, he exactly reproduces the few seconds of Fay Wray and Bruce Cabot running through the jungle, a delightful moment for those familiar with the original. Would that there had been more of this.<br /><br />There is /one/ sequence that shows how good this film might have been. The initial encounter with the natives and Ann's subsequent capture is much superior to the original - far more atmospheric, better staged, and more exciting. Nothing else in the remake attains this level.<br /><br />The BD was my second viewing of this film (the first having been on DVD). It clarified why I was offended. Jackson has so altered the original -- and not to much of a good end (other than getting rid of most of the silly dialog) -- that you sit there going \\"No, no, no, no, no. This is /dumb/.\\" \\"King Kong\\" is less obnoxious the second time around, simply out of familiarity. That doesn't mean it's a good film, or that Jackson made the right dramatic or aesthetic choices. He didn't.<br /><br />The original remains exciting (and silly). The remake is something worse than a bad film -- it's a pointless, overlong bore.<br /><br />----------<br /><br /> \\"King Kong\\" is nothing if not a great BD demo disk. Much of the film is just plain beautiful (though I do miss the Dor&eacute; skies of the B&W original), and is, technically, one of the most-startling films you'll ever see. Kong really looks like a living animal, and all but a handful of the CGI effects (such as the failure of the rowboats to look as if they're actually making contact with the water) are seamless. One Amazon reviewer's claim that you can see the green screen in some shots (I assume he means a green nimbus around the foreground objects) is absurd.<br /><br />The BD, unlike the DVD, has virtually no supplemental material, other than a running commentary. Jackson states that the commentary will try to steer clear of material presented in the supplements -- of which there are none. If you have one of the multi-disk DVD editions, you might want to hang onto it.<br /><br />Science note... Neither the original nor Jackson's remake (the latter especially) pay any attention to the fact that a small island cannot support large a variety of creatures -- big ones, especially -- that need food to survive. The apatosaurs, in particular, would strip the island of its treetop vegatation in just a few months. (This has been observed in elephants.)<br /><br />Another science note... Someone complained that Kong moves as if he were weightless. This is a common problem in CGI animation (see \\"Shreck\\" and \\"Spider-Man\\"), but it isn't true here. The real problem is that Kong makes impossible leaps. The reason is that mass scales as the cube of body size, but stregth scales only as the square. If a normal-size gorilla can't leap several times the length of its body, I guar-on-tee one the size of Kong won't be able to do it, either.<br /><br />Writer's note... Does it ever occur to directors to have someone vet their script for errors? One of the American producers follows Universal (the studio) with a plural verb, rather than a singular, in the ungrammatical British fashion. And the Army officer, griping about Kong's invasion of the \\"sacred\\" New York, calls him a \\"mutant monkey\\". Though the word dates to the turn of the 20th century, it was not in common use in 1932.<br /><br />* Yes, yes, yes... Marshal McLuhan actually said \\"The medium is the massage.\\"<br /><br />** I was going to say Caucasian, but Caucasians are dark-haired.<br /><br />*** How often does one encounter a film which can be described principally in terms of all the things wrong with it?<br /><br />**** It has been reported that this scene, in which the sailors who fall from the log are eaten by creatures in the pit, so revolted some viewers that they walked out. Cooper and Schoedsack said the scene was removed because it brought the film to a dead stop. Jackson doesn't seem to be aware that a long, poorly paced scene can have the same effect.<br /><br />***** There is probably no other movie in which most of the film is a continuous \\"chase\\" sequence, with barely a moment's rest.

B0026NWBY2|4.0|A good disc but there is some \\"filler\\" here and some really great songs that didn't make it.    That is probably a good reason for a volume two. Unfortunately, licensing problems will probably keep Harrison's Beatles work off of that one too.    Still, great to have a \\"new\\" disc out to get people listening again to this under-rated and wonderful musician.
B000G759LW|4.0|I love that Christina paid homage to the stars of the 20-40's era. I love the music and each song tells a different story. I think she could of toned-down her vocals on some of the tracks. I love the outfits and colors in the booklet. I still think her Stripped album was better.

What an incredible idea!! Listening to/Watching this always makes me feel good,feel better. One of my best buys ever - I would buy it again,and again,and again...
B000N4SHPS|3.0|Well it's hard not to like the Rocky saga in general, although I could very easily have done without Rocky IV & V.  This final episode is basically a sentimental recapturing of a sorts of the original Rocky film.  He's now clearly \\"WAY\\" past his prime and it's tough to even look at him frankly.  As another reviewer very correctly stated no boxing commission anywhere would sanction such a fight (exhibition or not).  However, in true overcome-all-odds fashion Rocky somehow makes it happen.  I won't give away the results of the match because frankly the official results are unimportant and not what he's after.  He's after validation just one more time.  Validation that he still matters . . . that the fire that still burns within him means something.  Adrian believed in him and he now needs to believe in himself just one last time.  Is it a great film?  Nope.  However, it's a warm sentimental film of remembrance not only of his journey and saga but of particular meaning to many of us baby boomer's who are aging and would like just one more moment in the sun before we head off to the rocking chair.  Rocky's \\"rock\\" was Adrian and he pays beautiful and appropriate tribute to her as the one person who did believe in him unconditionally.  The moral is to never give up and believe in yourself regardless of age or who says you can't do something.  Thanks Mr. Stallone for making this final film.  It was a far nicer ending to the Rocky series than Rocky V as it very warmly closed the circle of magic.  Thanks for the memories.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I rented the first disc of Season 1.   The scenes look vivid with colors.   The acting is not bad.  All other things about this show are not good. For example, like many other viewers said, it's like a soft porn. The plot is very thin. I get bored after finishing disc 1. I did not rent the remaining ones.
B00164KYV4|3.0|I would have loved if this DVD came in some kind of spectacular limited edition cover or with an extra disc perhaps. But no, all you'll get here is the movie itself (both widescreen and box sizes available, which is good) and a couple extras like deleted scenes.     The movie itself is impressive, funny, entertaining, true-to-life and touching so that's a plus and is a good enough reason to buy this DVD! I was just a little let down with the lack of extras.     1/10 for Extras.   9/10 for the movie itself.
0765356139|4.0|I really like how this series turns of of the cliches of fantasy on their head. The events of this book are neither predictable nor unsupported by the book. Sanderson manages to surprise you and keep you interested without resorting to out of the blue twists. I also would love to meet Vin in real life.
B00005JKDR|4.0|All new buyer be aware that this DVD is available at Spanish Books on the web and links to Amazon.  I assumed that this would be in Spanish as the detailed description says so, in addition to english and when I received the DVD which was in good condition, even tho used, it was in English.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|Its not made for heavy clean up, but it's great for getting the pet hair up on hard surfaces not to good on rugs, I would recommend this product for that hurry up job.
B0000714B5|4.0|As a Buddhist and a fan of the book this film was very well done.<br /><br />As a Buddhist (poverty vows), I can not purchase the DVD.<br /><br />But as a fan of Mr. Hesse's novel, I can purchase the DVD with a wheelbarrow of German money.
B000059GEI|5.0|I never realised how cinematically beautiful this film was until I watched it on DVD. The quality is amazing, it's so hard to believe it isn't a modern day film!    Donald O'Connor's talent does not go unnoticed: dancing, singing and 'making us laugh' with his wonderful comic timing. I love Mitzi Gaynor: she is such an energy in this film and you'll really notice this when you watch it. Johnnie Ray, ah now he just takes my breath away whenever I hear him sing (I am 22 so don't make any assumptions as to whether this is aimed only at the older crowd!). Marilyn Monroe never really had a fair go in the media and following her death but people seem to forget due to her iconic status that she was actually quite a good actress and performer. Of course, she plays a bombshell but she does it with such innocence that even I would love to have her as a sister-in-law if I were in their shoes! But to me, it is Ethel Merman that steals the show. Nobody does it better, her emotion as an actress, as a musical performer, everything. She's the real deal and her finale performance always brings me to tears.     WONDERFUL choreography, amazing costumes, great dialogue and storyline. A real gem. Timeless!!!    10/10.

031606792X|4.0|Stephanie Meyers, while unlikely to win any serious literary awards, has nonetheless tapped into the fantasies of many teenage girls. Breaking Dawn is the finale in her vampire/shape shifter series. Like all the books in the series, it's an easy read, despite its length. If you're a fan, you'll find Ms. Meyers delivers the goods.

0061767581|3.0|I love candy. And I loved The Hills when I first started watching not so long ago so it made sense to buy Lauren's debut novel, LA Candy. It's an easy and quick read. Nothing spectacular but let's face it, how many young adults can be bothered to sit down and write a novel anyway, let alone come up with characters, settings and a storyline to go with it? Not me, that's for sure so kudos on her effort here. She's done well, it's a little different to what's one the market in teen fiction at the moment but not drastically unique. A light, fun read. Get it if you love 'celebrity' and everything having to do with The Hills.
B00204AA0O|5.0|When this album first came out, I wasn't into it. I was still admiring Begin to Hope and I just wasn't ready. A week ago I had a 2 hour drive back to school. I listened to it twice and was hooked. Regina once again has proven herself one of the best. This album is just as good as Begin to Hope and Soviet Kitsch and it has it's own character.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|I purchased this DVD after seeing The Eagles in Concert in New Jersey in May 2008. Their NJ performance was more than I expected. 2 hours and 45 minutes of playing time with a a short break. They are still one of the tightest bands along with The E Street Band and The Heartbreakers. Best of all they have all been able to retain their voices and harmonies. The song selection, as on this DVD, included group and solo efforts. To be honest Joe Walsh stole the NJ concert with his 4 solo efforts. Funk 49 and Rocky Mountain Way galvanized the crowd. Don Henley's All She Wants To Do Is Dance was a close second. Everytime I watch this DVD I am reminded how much I enjoyed the NJ concert. The Eagles are one of the bands that retrospectively remind us of when things were good and right in our lives, especially as our hair grows grey, thinner and our bones ache just a little more. We might not be the new kid in town but we can still experience that peaceful easy feeling by watching this DVD or listening to their music. Take It Easy.
B002BEXFW8|3.0|I ordered this with great anticipation, largely on the basis of the Amazon description of Speed King as the US album version - I took this to mean that I would finally get a remastered version of Speed King without the UK version's \\"shred\\" guitar intro (which was cool for one or two listens but now I find just irritating).  I receive the cd, unwrap it, put it in the player, and what is the first thing I hear?  The cacaphonous shred beginning of the UK version!  OK, fine - this is not a disaster as long as the remaster sounds good.  Well, no dice there either - while listening to it I found myself vaguely dissatisfied, and when I A-B'd the gold cd with the Anniversary Edition, I realized why: the Anniversary Edition has much more presence, is louder and has more bottom end than the gold cd.  The gold cd pales in comparison.  If you don't yet have the Anniversary Edition, buy that instead (it's much less expensive, as well).  If you already have the Anniversary Edition, skip the gold cd and save your money; you already have the best version of In Rock.
B00288KNJU|4.0|Specs (VC-1 video, dts-HD Master audio)    Movie : 4/5  2D video : 5/5  3D video : 1/5  audio : 5/5  menu navigation : 5/5  interactivity : 5/5    The BD movie is a significant upgrade from the DVD, although I believe the DVD video and audo quality has been deliberately undermastered downgraded to promote the BD package. This is not the case with Disney's Bolt as they pushe the DVD specs to the limits for the DVD version of Bolt or Wall-E, therefore solid releases. The same cannot be said for DVD version of Coraline.    Other than my DVD caveat Universal has delivered a strong BD package. The Blu-ray interactivity is in par with Universal's later HD DVD releases (the ones with the new menus) so I mean is simply awesome.    Veredict: highly recommended just skip the 3D version.
B00001IVOR|4.0|Unfortunately WU will always be compared to the first album which is unfair. This is a very good album, while not a classic, definitely worth picking up.
0375831002|5.0|I'll admit, I don't read novels often, but if you want true and pure storytelling at it's most creative and most surprising, than get this book- fast. Even if only to gain a new respect for words.    There are moments where you just want to drop the book and hug Liesel, the eponymous protagonist. There are other passages that are so beautiful, so philosophical, that you cannot but stop and think. And finally, there will be moments where you will feel your emotions do things you never thought possible.    This book is something else, entirely. I never knew words could do this.     And you will learn too, with Liesel.      An astonishing, near-perfect classic.
B0018RWD6S|5.0|There are few albums that I love as much as this one, and with a Jazz collection the size of mine that is saying something.<br /><br />Coltrane once said of Stan Getz \\"If everyone could sound like that, they would.\\" I am pretty sure he was just being diplomatic and humble, but there is something there. Getz had a way of phrasing a line that took Lester Young's sound and concept and brought it directly into the be-bop era (as if the Prez weren't quite there already). On this album we hear Coltrane playing beautifully, artfully, melodically, with sophisticated phrasing that is profoundly beautiful and at time mesmerizing. On these ballads, Coltrane proved that he could absolutely \\"sound like that,\\" and much more.<br /><br />Johnny Hartman's deep, beautiful, and lyrical voice is artfully deployed on this record. Melodies come to life in new and surprising, but deeply musical ways.<br /><br />Lush Life, written by the great Billy Stayhorn, is interpreted beautifully on this album. This may be the best version of the song ever recorded. But every track is rich and deep and well worth several listens.<br /><br />Those of us with large collections have plenty of records we have listened to once and put away never to have them entire our ears again. This is one of those records that one plays again and again, and it never gets old. It reveals new treasures with each listen.<br /><br />This is a must have record in the Coltrane disocgraphy. For those seeking to learn to appreciate this great master of the tenor saxophone, it is also an excellent starting point. These are some of the most beautiful and accessible solos he ever recorded.<br /><br />Gorgeous!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|this book was absolutely inspirational. It was so incredible. I read all 400 or so pages in 2 days. literally couldnt put it down. i went on a 3 day family vacation thinking it would take me at least the entire vacation to read and just flew through it.  one of the best books ive ever read. i was dissapointed when it was over. but it was an incredible read.
B0000024JA|3.0|Really was a disappointment. I know people love Meth, but this album really did not live up to the expectations, especially when you compare it to the other original Wu solo projects.
B00026ZG10|1.0|I am very choosy with my Schwartznegger movies, and this was the worst. It's even worse than \\"The Terminator\\". I guess I had a hard time with the double life of a computer salesman, and being a spy. I couldn't keep up, and then there's the double life of the computer salesman's wife with the used car salesman. However, the action scenes while thrilling were hard to believe. I just feel that they overdid this movie, and it's just terrible. I also found it humilating when they made the used car salesman pee himself. Was that suppossed to be funny? I just didn't like this movie, and perfer the movie \\"Eraser\\" over this. At least with \\"Eraser\\" it was more intelligent.
6305014140|3.0|Its about a ninja whose for hire trying to cure himself of poison in his body. It has excellent details and graphics but the plot colud have been longer and less sexual.
031606792X|1.0|I am honestly still waiting for some breaking news release that Breaking Dawn was in fact a hoax and that Stephanie Meyer will be releasing the real copy soon. It was that bad. It was totally disconnected from the first three novels, they were totally different characters. Bella, Edward, and Jacob abandoned all of their endearments, their charms, their weaknesses and strengths, they abandon them for careless, disconnected, unpredictable, and downright irritating personalities. I hated this book with a passion. I found myself repeating to myself over and over \\"You have got be kidding me\\"...what I find hardest to believe is that Stephanie Meyer, as an author allowed such a beautiful story told through the Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse trilogy to end the way it did with Breaking Dawn. Bella was so unpractical, so careless, and so irrational...totally unBella. Edward was extremely disconnected and Jacob...oh Jacob. Poor, poor Jacob. I was a Team Jacob fan from the beginning, especially after the kiss in Eclipse, omg. And what kind of ending does Jacob receive for being Bella's constant savior? He ends up with a ridiculously perfect freak of nature named Renesmee??? This story was rushed, thrown together, and silly.
B00005U2LM|3.0|Definitely the most disappointing of all of the WU albums. Even if you are a WU fan, this is an album you can pass on...
B000002IV8|4.0|The vocals here are matured, and so is the sound. I know for thrashers this is a sell-out, but I know you all tell me to have an open mind. Well here's my open mind. I used to have this album, but never had the courage to play it, and now I have sampled it, and say \\"This really rocks hard\\". Mind you it's not classic Overkill like \\"Taking Over\\", or \\"Feel The Fire\\", but it's still good. Some of the highlights here are: \\"Dreaming In Colombian\\", \\"Spiritual Void\\", \\"Feel The Hurt\\", \\"Ghost Dance\\", and \\"Ignorance and Innocence\\". They get a little funky with some of these songs I guess they were trying to copy Testament's \\"The Ritual\\". Mind you as far as hearing black I would say go to the \\"Years Of Decay\\" album, and play \\"Playing With Spiders/Skullkrusher\\". That's about the blackest these guys ever got.
0330449605|5.0|This book is a good light read for almost any age,(no graphic violence nor sex, so younger readers can enjoy this book too).  The 645 pages flew by, each revealing a new piece of the puzzle.  I liked the three timelines running through the book connecting the characters, who are nicely developed and believable. Because of the way Kate Morton organized the plot, it is easy for \\"stop and go\\" reading.  I enjoyed the book very much and look forward to other Kate Morton books.
B0015KO52S|4.0|As a panoptikum (sorry not aware if there's an english word for this) of the musician's influences \\"Consolers of the Lonely\\" is a love letter and fan-orama of the most pleasant order. You hear familiar chords, beats and realise they are carfully balanced with the more experimental side of Jack White's and Brendan Benson's musical spectrum.    Always one to try something new by taking the old and mold it, White with Stripes or Dead Weather is never boring and sometimes brilliant. And with this album, and many might disagree, he seems to have found a magical mixture between the \\"avantgarde\\" and the traditional.    If you care to give the works of Mr. White and his collaborators a chance, I suggest this album might be a very good point to start from.    No musician lives up to the hype that surrounds him, but he might just live up to their craft. White, Benson et al. certainly do on this album. Maybe not as cohesive as some may wish, but a beautiful gallery of ideas and concepts.    Let your ears be consoled.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This movie was just so well done and awesome.  The storyline too was very good.
B000002MUW|4.0|I almost gave up on this one because of the songs:\\"Secret\\", and \\"Take A Bow\\" these don't belong on here at least as far as I'm concerned. \\"Take A Bow\\" is one I would probably dance to if I was a zombie, and \\"Secret\\" is a rather moody little piece. However, it starts out strong with \\"Survival\\", and there were a couple of others noteworthy such as: \\"Love Tried To Welcome Me\\", and \\"Human Nature\\". She followed this up after \\"Erotica\\", and she really branced out with R&B, and Smooth Jazz sounds on this one. No brainless pop music, or controversial songs here. Just a honest to goodness pop album.
1416955070|4.0|Ok! I was off to a questionable start with City of Bones, considering the fact that I was comparing and hoping it would be similar to Twilight. The demons and warlocks threw me off at the beginning but I started to get more intrigued when the story started to come together more and question for romance surfaced. Definitely eager to read book 2 the way things ended with book one.  I youtubed to see if there were fan made trailers of a possible movie for Mortal Instruments. There was a fanmade trailer that helped me visualize what the main characters would look like and made reading more interesting for me.  As I got to the middle of book one I actually caught myself thinking that this was better than Twilight.  I can't seem to find a paperback version of book three. I guess its only in hardcover?? OH well.. hardcover it is.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This video was mailed quickly, was in the condition that was stated and is a very good example of what it is like to attend a Michael Jackson concert.
B001H1OUWU|3.0|This is undoubtedly one of the greatest albums of all time in any genre.  I already own it in other formats so the content was in no way a surprise.   However, I expected the vinyl to be almost a revelation sound-wise. This is not the case.  The record has a lot of noise. This is probably not surface noise, but tape hiss. I am really bewildered as to how 40 year old can degrade so much. Other recordings of that period still sound great and dead silent.  This is still worth buying since the music is amazing, but I still consider it a bit of a disappointment as I expected so much more.
1931955085|3.0|The book had no paper cover - making it reminscent of a school text.  This makes the art book look less formal. The color did not reproduce as nicely on the front of the book either. Still- for the price i decided not to return it. The inside of the book is quite interesting. It uses different mediums and papers. It makes it a little exciting to see it segment. I would recommend the book if you are a fan. The only drawback being one thing- the lacking of a formal paper cover.
1932100660|5.0|I was very happy to see that this book looked like I had just picked it up from the bookstore shelf. Excellent condidion. I was also empressed with the quick delivery.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Michael is awesome, wonderful, the greatest, I'm an \\"old school rules\\" guy but after seeing and hearing this collection I'm reminded not only is M.J. old school, but \\"M.J. RULES\\" !!!
B001FB55H6|4.0|Great movie. Loved it. Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoyed 300 or enjoys a good mix of humour, violence and plot.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This book was such a charming read.  I was so sorry for it to be finished. It gave great insight into the realities of being occupied by the Germans during WW2. I thoroughly enjoyed the writing style and getting to know each of the delightful characters.
B00006LLNU|4.0|4 1/2    One of rock's slowest-burning entries, () may be a little too down and down-tempo for certain occasions and personalities, but for the right time secures something as close to electrified holy music any established act has brought forth.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv I must admit. Wasn't a big fan of Martha though in S3. My only problem I have with the dvd's is that they pretty much NEVER go on sale and at the prices you see them, they're just too expensive for purchase. Hopefully that'll change at some point down the road.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|This is great from the packaging all the way to the DVD's. The suede fringed vest covering for the box makes me want to display the set on a shelf. The DVD's enclosed show extended Woodstock footage including the set up and concert. If you are not a Woodstock fan this may be too much footage for you but the Woodstock fan in our house loves it.
B0000000LI|4.0|Say what you will about the new-age spokesman's watered down studio releases, but spare Acropolis the ridicule- still a most ambitious live recording which, not without its world-music-for-tourists grandstanding, affords most of these noteworthy and energetic compositions the epic hue studio mastery often robs.
B000001EUN|5.0|This is the second in the \\"Mach 2\\" version of this fine German Metal Band from Germany featuring the very talented lead guitar skills of Matthias Jabs. Right off the bat, for you Guitarists out there like myself, I am a HUGE Michael Schenker Fan, and loved what he did on Lovedrive, and have to admit that Matthias did a more than adequate job filling the Scorps need for a Melodic and emotive Guitarist like Michael. In my opinion, this is the best Scorpions Album of what myself and a lot of fans refer to as the \\"Triumvirate\\" of the best 3 albums [Lovedrive/Animal Magnetism/Blackout] of their entire career. Of course, it could be argued by a Scorpions Purist, that the earlier Ulrich Roth material was far edgier and Progressive sounding without a care in the World to pandering to commercial tastes, but I digress... Songwise, this is the strongest of the 3 albums mentioned above with the hard rock songs here just pummeling you like giant Ball Peen Hammer - if built by Porsche. This songwriting to me is the very essence of great Hard Rock craftsmanship. Memorable Guitar hooks that never leave you, pounding and tasty Bass and Drums with songs that straddle that very difficult balance (that almost EVERY Metal Band in the late 80's failed miserably at...) between being memorable without being too Radio-Friendly, and great chops for a Musician like me to appreciate and be inspired by. Lady Starlight as a Ballad is a very sweet song that thankfully Klaus has the sensitivity to deliver without sounding like a \\"Metal Dude\\" that had to throw in a \\"soft song\\" to appease the record company and the Girls in the fan base. For those of you that appreciate a clean, punchy Mix as I do, the record sounds great with all the instruments balanced perfectly with no trace of muddiness in evidence - even more impressive considering the heavy Bass mix and energetic Kick-Drum from Herman! MUCH credit is due to Dieter Dierks as Producer, as he did a wonderful job polishing these already great songs and making everything sound as clear as a bell. To sum up, these songs are top-notch, the recording/mix will impress you, but most imoprtantly, this kind of simple but hooky Hard Rock sonwriting like this along with early Y&T, Montrose, UFO, etc., is sadly a thing of the past. This is Scorpions in their finest hour. All you have to do now is buy the remastered CD and fire up your giant Pioneer speakers from the 70's and bliss out to the greatest era in hard rock history. Trust me.
B000W746GK|5.0|Great movie. I have read all the books and seen them all at the movies, but I wanted to be able to watch them anytime. Great entertainment.
0694003611|5.0|Goodnight Moon is an apparently simple bedtime book whose appeal has endured for over sixty years.  In it, a small rabbit delays bedtime by saying goodnight to all the objects in his room.  The text is soothingly rhythmic, and the well-conceived artwork depicts the same bedroom from different perspectives in two-page colored spreads, alternating with close-up pictures of individual objects in shades of gray.  As the bunny slowly subsides into bed and sleep, the light in the room dims until shapes are nearly imperceptible.  This warm and comforting story traces the emotional transition of a young child from active relationship to restful solitude, all in the context of a stable and secure home emblemized by the unchanging objects in the room.  A wonderful book.
B000M343BM|5.0|Even after all these years this movie is still hilarious. If you haven't seen it in years then take the time to watch it again, if you've never seen it get ready for a treat.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Get Blueray. I love the added scences that are in the directors cut and how the movie flows seemlessly through them. Also great to watch the movie with the bonus features that includes timelines, sketches and other bonus info.
0307454541|4.0|This book is a great way to wile the way the hours. What I liked best about the book is the way it starts off with the protagonist getting into big trouble with a corporation he had the gall to go up against--jail for 2 years. Well, jail in Sweden sounds fairly civilized, but still... Then there's this great mystery, wonderfully drawn characters, the most interesting is the Girl with the Tattoo, naturally. My only complaint is the rushed ending. Resolving the who-done-it is quite interesting, but the resolution is sudden and short. Then the second resolution (payback against the nasty corporation), is equally rushed. Otherwise, it's a good read.
078322611X|3.0|I guess I must be missing something when it comes to this movie. Why it gets such high ratings from others is a bit of a mystery to me. I thought that overall it was rather boring, and the whole premise of the movie I thought was absurd. A disembodied voice tells a farmer to build a baseball diamond in the middle of his corn field so a bunch of ghosts can come play there, and he actually does it? And his dingbat wife thinks it's a great idea? Sorry, but it's just too much of a leap for me.
B000ZN802W|5.0|I love this movie, and I just couldn't wait until Christmas to get it.  I recommend the book as well.
159562015X|4.0|This book is a great little guide. It comes with a code so you can go to the internet for a test to help find your strengths. The code can only be used once. So passing on the book doesn't help much. Otherwise, a nice tool.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I got the Fight Club DVD very quickly after ordering it. Even with standard shipping, it arrived in less than a week. I recommend this seller to everyone.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Great story!  Interested in Mickey Rourke and the changes in his life.  It was put together well with the help of the Boss.  The product I purchased was fine as new and the price was right.
B001H65HGS|5.0|As with \\"The Sopranos,\\" \\"Sons\\" has plenty of guns and violence, but it prefers to find its drama in the dialogue, in the internal struggles of the characters. Here, of course, there's a much larger Shakespearean mythology at work.     And though that may prove to be too obvious in time, Sutter shows in the first two episodes that he's a storyteller who can lay down an intriguing narrative framework. There's a Mexican gang working to mess with the Sons of Anarchy for selling weapons to their rivals in Oakland. There are white supremacists trying to upstage the Sons of Anarchy right in Charming.     And though the local police department and county sheriff are on the take, there's a rising force in the police department ready to clean up the town, not to mention feds ready to pounce.    Elsewhere there are other struggles. Jax is feeling the changes of impending fatherhood. He believes that the club's philosophy - \\"brains before bullets\\" - has been all but abandoned. There's a mystery about Tara's return to town (it has raised flags with Gemma - probably the smartest one in the club). And then there's the manuscript Jax finds, which raises doubts about all kinds of things.     Few series have exploded onto the scene with such a rich array of potential stories and inherently interesting characters. A biker gang. What took them so long to get here?
0743298039|5.0|What a compelling tale, beautifully told!  Even with a toddler and an infant, I was so drawn in by the story and the characters that it was worth sacrificing precious sleep to reach the satisfying conclusion.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|So, in 1992, what was all the fuss about?  This was when the mainstream press turned against Madonna.  And why?  Because in her book, and in her film \\"Body of Evidence\\", and on this album, Madonna dared to trumpet the very adult notion that SEX IS OK.  \\"Erotica\\", probably her most under-appreciated album, is to me one of her best.  On \\"Like A Prayer\\" she had matured, but with \\"Erotica\\" she became the goddess that her fans know and love.  She led us mainstream urchins from the sunny pop 80's into the darker, more uncertain 90's.  Her lyrics described a graphic adult world, and her music reflected the newly emerging club scene, the forerunner of dominant rap and hip-hop.  This is exhibited very strongly in the title track, of which most of the lyrics are spoken, not sung, a disconcerting phenomenon in 1992.  (Of course, it proved to be the shape of things to come.)  The old sultry standard \\"Fever\\" is given a no-frills, hard dance treatment.  \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" is similar, a little less frenetic, but the barely audible nasal vocal suggests thought rather than speech, and the words are hilariously sarcastic.  Things get serious again with \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", a rich, lavish fusion of disco and club music that morphs into 3 or 4 songs before it is over.  And the lyrics!  \\"Daddy couldn't be all wrong, and my mama made me learn this song.\\"  She may as well have been writing my bio.  At the climactic moment, she recalls her own hit \\"Vogue\\" by singing, with extreme ecstasy, \\"You've got to just let your body move to the music...Let your body go with the flow!\\"<br /><br />Two tracks I did not appreciate that much in 1992 are \\"Where Life Begins\\" and \\"Secret Garden\\".  But now, a little older and wiser, I see that they simply strayed from pop territory into a more adult jazz feel.  We get back on track with \\"Bad Girl\\", a hypnotic, mid-tempo description of how we all loathe ourselves \\"later\\", when we have had just a little too much fun.  \\"Waiting\\" is similar to \\"Erotica\\" in that most of it is spoken and it features state-of-the-art (then) dance music sound effects.  (Love the ticking clock!)  There is yet another set of twins - \\"Thief of Hearts\\" and \\"Words\\" - adult themes, pure club music.  The last line of \\"Thief of Hearts\\" is priceless:  \\"Stop Bitch - now sit your ass down.\\"  \\"Rain\\" combines the spoken word with layered harmonies in a ballad that compares the heartbreaking beauties of Nature and of Love.  \\"Why's It So Hard\\" is similar in style to \\"Keep It Together\\" from \\"Like A Prayer\\", and it continues that song's theme of \\"family\\" by addressing us all as \\"Brothers, Sisters\\" as Madonna pleads for the respect she, and we, deserve.  \\"In This Life\\" sounds appropriately dirge-like, since it tells of the ravages of AIDS, its effects on the singer's life, and society's apparent apathy.<br /><br />If anyone can listen to \\"Like A Prayer\\", \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Ray Of Light\\" and still refer to Madonna as a lightweight \\"fluff\\" pop star, then he or she needs thorough auditory and psychiatric examinations.<br /><br />(...For Adrienne...)spoken and it features state-of-the-art (then) dance music sound effects.

B001BSBBEE|1.0|Anybody who has ever seen this film needs no warning to stay as far away from this DVD as possible. It is a moody horror classic that induces nightmares as few other films can do, but much of that comes from the truly creepy black & white photography. Colorizing it would absolutely ruin it, but Legend is a company that specializes in ruining B&W public domain films by colorizing them, as if we're too stupid to enjoy a film with its original cinematography. There are wonderful versions of Carnival of Souls out there - it's good enough that you should seek them out, particularly the wonderful Criterion Collection DVD. But this one? Garbage.
B0021L8USK|5.0|Just watched the movie at the opening night and I am spellbound! Firstly, I am living in Johannesburg and was absolutely amazed at many a subtle hints and glances at history this movie gave. There were too many moments that only living in Johannesburg will make one truly understand what the director was hinting at, and all done and put together brilliantly in a way I haven't seen done much before. Secondly, I simply loved the way Neil (btw never heard of him before) didn't conform to the traditional and all too cliched Hollywood sci-fi recipe, and wasn't scared of breaking lots of Hollywood cinema 'laws'. Alien ships always land somewhere in the US, aliens are always here to kill us with no reason, we always are the experts in solving any issues in the end - none of these were followed. I read some reviews of the film being too racist, xenophobic, sexist etc. which were issues that I believe the director was actually trying to highlight to us, rather than capitalise on them. And these are real issues well and alive in many countries outside of South Africa, not sure why people pretend to see past and overlook them as if life is all perfect. In conclusion, a very thought-provoking movie for me that combines great elements of sci-fi action and storytelling - and maybe the message is, sometimes to be human again we have to think like and become alien.
B0018BB21G|4.0|Some mysteries here.  There's a mention of an outtake called \\"Kings and Queens\\" in the liner notes and I've seen it on import reissues, but is not included here.  Also - to my ears, \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" sounds like it's in mono; as it might have been in the original - otherwise - stereo release. Perhaps because it was a single(?)
B002DESIE6|5.0|Very few albums can be played and enjoyed all the way through on the first listen.  This is one of them.  The tracks seamlessly progress from one to the next, only getting better with repeated listens.  XX is for me, intimate and atmospheric. A cross between Adele, Bon Iver and Interpol. I agree with the earlier posts, that this could very well be one of the best debut albums of 2009.  Pick up a copy, you wont be disappointed.
B001BNFR6W|5.0|I love this show.  I'm sad that it is no longer in production.  FYI, not all episodes are include in the \\"Complete Series\\" collection.  Nonetheless, I enjoy watching what is included.    Thank you!

B0012QE4Q2|1.0|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was actually closer to the book than this was.  I would never guess that even possible!  Ill admit that I had to turn the movie off after 1 hr 10 minutes because it was..... lunacy.  I'm sure Ann was not happy that her sister was marrying b4 her because they are rivals but the movie makes her seem not only happy but almost excited.<br /><br />Ann seems soft and girly.<br /><br />Marys marriage to sir Carey was not romantic, it was arranged so the conversation in the dancing circle about loving him for him and not needing someone grander never took place<br /><br />It was not Marys wedding that Ann caught the eye of Percy<br /><br />I don't think that Princess Mary was there when The Queen miscarried.  Children are sent away at the very latest 4 and with Mary being a Princess She was sent away much sooner that that.  When the Queen did see Mary it was because she and the King visited her not she visit them.<br /><br />The first conversation between father and uncle bugs me.  #1, uncle talks of the king needing a mistress soon and suggests a Howard girl  that isn't how it happened.  Henry took an active interest in Mary and they went from there it was not premeditated.  2 they say that father suggested Ann and uncle was concerned that she she was his first born and favorite and father might want a simpler life for her.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  If this conversation had actually taken place which I know it didn't because of #1, uncle would have salivated!  He cares of nothing and no one but himself getting ahead and it doesn't matter who gets him there.  He never would have been concerned that father might want a simpler marriage for Ann.<br /><br />On Mary's wedding night when Ann and Mary are having a heart to heart and Mary is telling Ann that no one could wish for a better sister, I notice that the B is absent from Ann's pearl necklace.<br /><br />Check to see if the king and really went to the Boleyn's.  The girls were members of court at 4 years old so I don't think that is how it would have played out.  Additionally Ann is wearing a cross from her pearls instead of the B.  If you read the book you know that the B on her necklace is where Ann pulls her confidence. It is a symbol of everything she is.  It's her soul on a chain.<br /><br />Ann was not with the king when he was initially hurt.  She was in France.  He hasn't met her yet.<br /><br />This is lunacy. Mary is tending to the king after the first injury instead of the queen!  The Queen always takes care of the king.  After the king is hurt the second time in the book and slipping in and out of conscience, it is the Queen (even though shes dead) that he calls out to exclaiming that if she were here she would know exactly what to do. Additionally he asks why hes never seen her at court.  Mary was raised at court and has served by the Queens side her whole life so much so that she looks at the Queen as a mother to her.<br /><br />On top of the fact that Mary and Ann don't go to court together instead Mary has been there since she was four to serve the Queen (and is her favorite) and when Ann comes home from France (not because she was exiled) she goes to the castle and visits George and Mary.  This is the first time that the King meets Ann.<br /><br />Am i watching the right movie??????<br /><br />The girl that chases Mary to tell her what a good woman the Queen is after she makes Mary sing is so sweet.  I almost fell off the couch when she introduced herself as Jane Parker.  Haha what a joke that girl doesn't have a sweet bone in her crazy, nosy body.<br /><br />30 minutes in and we meet Stafford!!!  Oh for crying out loud.  And they should have made him hotter.  ps  Still no B on Ann's chain<br /><br />George was supposed to walk Mary to the kings Quarters.  He does so every time and he waits outside for her and escorts her back to her room.<br /><br />Did Mary really ask the king to have the servants bring her water?Ill check but I don't think so.  She never asked him for anything until after they had children and it was only in their regards.<br /><br />On a positive note Good choice for King.  What a knockout!!!!!!<br /><br />I cant believe how badly Ann's marriage is portrayed.  They are engaged and bed but not legally married to get legally married they have to go to Wolsey and thus creates the very seed of Ann's hate and ambition.  ahhh<br /><br />The movie works hard to make the Boleyn girls mother seem loving and caring and even sad at Ann's departure to France (which is all screwed up) but in truth she stands quietly behind her husband and brother.  She even states to Mary in the book that she did what was best for her children by sending them away at 4 and no she most certainly never missed them at all.<br /><br />A son!!!!!!!!!!  What of baby Catherine<br /><br />I am 50 minutes into the movie and Ann finally has her B necklace.  I have to give up on notes because the movie isn't even close to the book.<br /><br />At 70 minutes I have given up on the film.  I am embarrassed that someone tried to pull this off as a movie of the book.  Maybe if it had been someones version of what happened I would get that but to say it is of the book is absurd. Everything is so screwed up I can't stand it.  The way Henry courts Ann, Mary's little girl isn't even in the movie, the lack of relationship between Mary and the Queen (and how they are associated) the list goes on and on.  I give up.  It's just.... pitiful.their regards.    On a positive note Good choice for King.  What a knockout!!!!!!    I cant believe how badly Ann's marriage is portrayed.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Others have reviewed this movie, so read theirs.  I have never listened to, or read any reviews from other people because most, if not all, are wrong anyway.  I use my own judgment and watch the movies myself.  If I had listened to any of the \\"professional\\" critics, or \\"pretend\\" critics, I would not have enjoyed most of the movies I have watched.  Everyone has different tastes and should use their own brain.
1400063515|4.0|Finished \\"The Black Swan - The Impact of the Highly Improbable\\" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb recently. This is a tough read. Clearly an incredibly intelligent man with some terribly worthwhile insights. However, my gut tells me that for most folk s, the majority would fall asleep before they got through a chapter. For those seeking a challenging, intellectually stimulating read, this book is a treasure. For people in a variety of disciplines his insights are vigorously important.<br /><br />I adore this excerpt that basically characterizes the premise of the book:<br /><br />  \\"The Black Swan problem in its original form: How can we know the future , given knowkedge of the past; or, more generally, how can we figure out properties of the (infinite) unknown based on the (finite) known? -- what can a turkeylearn about what is in store for it tomorrow from the events of yesterday? A lot, perhaps, but certainly a little less than it thinks, and it is just that \\"little less\\" that may make all the difference. The turkey problem can be generalized to any situation where the same hand that feeds you can be the one that wrings your neck\\" p. 40.<br /><br />If one considers the explanations for the current/ongoing economic malaise in the U.S., we continue to attempt to regain our balance after having our necks wrung by hands that we had thought were nurturing prosperity.<br /><br />Taleb's boundary breaking contribution here adds to the credibility of the recent work of Yale's Robert Shiller and UC Berkeley's George Akerloff....there is vastly more to be learned in the field of economics its relationship to human behavior. As Taleb p0ints out:<br /><br />  \\"Cognitive scientists have studied our natural tendency to look only for corroboration; they call this vulnerability to the corroboration error the conformation bias.\\" p. 58.<br /><br />Perhaps the conundrum of the current recession will cause practicioners, researchers and academics to garner the courage to begin to move beyond what we thought we knew in terms of economics and human behavior. Taleb says:<br /><br />  \\"Once your mind is inhabited by a certain view of the world, you will tend to only consider instances proving you to be right. Paradoxically, the more information you have, the more justified you feel in your views.\\" p.59.<br /><br />This book encourages one to \\"intellectually reach\\" - to be emboldened to take up avenues of inquiry, in a multiplicity of disciplines, that require spanning the boundaries of what we think we know, and how we know so....to begin to question the comfort and complacency that inhabit the essence of the term self-righteous - smugly ignorant in the comfort of where we find ourselves, our professions and the community of mankind.cs and human behavior. Taleb says:        \\"Once your mind is inhabited by a certain view of the world, you will tend to only consider instances proving you to be right.

0380807343|4.0|Coraline<br />by Neil Gaiman<br />Harper Trophy, 2002<br />978-0-7443-1812-8<br />Children/Young Adult<br />162 pages<br />Supernatural Fiction<br />Paperback<br /><br />Neil Gaiman has been named as one of the top ten living post-modern writers (the Dictionary of Literary Biography). A prolific creator of comics, drama, poetry, prose and song lyrics, he's also been called the new face of horror fiction. You can even find him active in other media such as blogging, film, journalism, radio and television.<br /><br />Coraline has won an incredible roster of awards and is, of course, a New York Times Best-seller. I decided to review Neil Gaiman's horror story for children because it was just released this past Tuesday as a DVD. This was a big deal in our household, as my 12-yr old daughter owns a copy of the book and the movie never came to our small city.<br /><br />I can see why she was excited. Gaiman's story reads effortlessly. And the scenes are a wonderful collection of darkness and light, of horror and comedy and, always, even in the evil, of love. Through it all we follow Coraline, a bored schoolgirl on holiday and in a new home. The target of a wannabe mother from a sinister, alternate world, she too, is an interesting mixture of characteristics. Short as the book is, we delight in the growing understanding in the girl of what love means and of the sacrifices it sometimes demands.<br /><br />Coraline is unlike Neil Gaiman's other mind-boggling works. It is a compact, lean and fully comprehensive piece. And I think it showcases just how brilliant this author is.<br /><br />Note: In my opinion, the movie is a disappointment. Much of the shadowy feel of the written work is gone, surprising since the director is Tim Burton. Additional characters were added and scenes were modified, not for the better. My daughter says the movie was OK, but claims the book was better and commented on the same disappointments as I.<br /><br />Copyright © Clayton Clifford Bye 2009

0810970686|3.0|Parent Review:      Diary of a Wimpy kid: The Last Straw by Jeff Kinney is the 3rd book in the series Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I've read all of the books in the series now. To be honest, I understand why kids are drawn to them but as an adult reading them all back to back they got a bit old. As I've shared in my reviews of the other books in the series, this is one of my son's favorite book series. My son who is 10, was so happy that I read the first book and when I finished it, he lined up book 2 and 3 in the series on my nightstand. It was nice to know what he was reading and talk about the books with him.     This book, continues the story of Gregory, a middle schooler who started writing a diary one summer when his mother bought him one. He's continued writing his stories and complementing them with comics. The comics definitely add a lighter, fun feel to the book and kids seem to love this part. Gregory continues to get himself into embarrassing situations and learns lessons the hard way. This book starts off on New Year's Day where he tries to help other people improve and then it ends at the start of summer vacation. His father seems to be a bit disappointed in his son's and the antics they get into. He decides that they need to learn how to be \\"men\\" and threatens to send Gregory to military school. Gregory ends up doing all he can to \\"bond\\" with his father and of course, ends up in many precarious situations and not at all what he intended in the first place. The book also details ways that Greg tries to get along with his brothers, his attempts to impress a girl named Holly in his class, and how Greg attempts to get through being placed on a soccer team he doesn't like. It's obvious in the book that Greg is doing all he can as a kid to get through life. He tends to be self centered and socially awkward and kids can definitely relate to that as well as the theme that grown ups really don't get it. I think that is a universal rule in childhood...Kids don't thinkthat their parents or any grown ups \\"get it\\"!
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I read this book years ago and i was just looking at the reviews on this book and i find all of the bad reviews amusing. Before Frey went back on Oprah to receive his \\"spanking\\" so many people were gung-ho on this book. Once, he received that bashing on Oprah's show, people seemed to dislike the book. This was a great book and so what if parts aren't true? Doesn't that make him an even better storyteller? People need to stop being sheep (followers) I read both this and the second part and they were both FANTASTIC books. If you are thinking of reading this book don't let the flock of sheep reviews discourage you.
