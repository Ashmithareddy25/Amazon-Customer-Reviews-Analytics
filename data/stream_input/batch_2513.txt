B005EGXTEE|5.0|I am so hooked on this series and it is just the best. I love the kindle cos i can read it over and over and over!!
B003YUS3JI|4.0|Good shoe but not the same fit and finish from same shoe purchased at the Crocs store. These are a bit bigger and something seems different with respect to the quality. I am overly satisfied but feel the shoes purchased at the crocs store are better. These were manufactured in the same country as the ones I got at Crocs store.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best ·It's fun to fun to play with my friends and my family·Thanks to the maker of this game
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|The Big Chill was a great movie about a group of old friends morning the loss of another friend.  The movie is sad, funny and has great music!  This is a movie you must see to truly appreciate.  It's a classic, don't miss out!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is cute. Well put together. The graphics are great. A lot of fun and a great way to pass the time.
B00479SVBU|5.0|It is a great product worked best from all similar products from different brands I have tried before. It is better to expend this extra dollars instead of the cheap ones, only some things will make this product amazing more navigation buttons like dedicated for file and folder browsing, iluminated buttons and bit lager LCD but even as it is, it is a 5 stars product.
B008602KQI|4.0|Love the movie it is just a little too drawn out. The beginning is really long and doesnt really explain whats going on
159463176X|5.0|After reading Hosseini\\"s first two books, which were mesmerizing, stay-up-all-night-and-finish heart stoppers, This was a complete change of pace, which kind of took me by surprise. But I loved it. About halfway through I felt I was missing connections, so I stopped and made a diagram of the characters, where they were at each point in the book (Paris, Afghanistan, the US, Greece...), and how they were connected to the others, if they were. I'd advise doing that from the start, and paying a lot of attention to detail, because some of it will catch you unawares, \\"years later\\" in the narrative. The book is a lot like life--small decisions sometimes have huge consequences, big decisions may not have that great an effect, deciding against your conscience will likely lead down a path you wish you'd never started on. And lastly, even when things don't turn out perfectly, as they usually don't, there is still purpose, joy and even some magic in life.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|We purchased this to catch-up on the show, and we love it! It was worth the money to purchase this and catch up.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Vampire Weekend continues to mature and refine their sound. Each of their albums was better than the last, and this one is their best so far.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|This book is profound, funny, sad and hard to put down. The 1st 200 pages are a bit slow, but stick with it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven was what I would consider a typical Nicholas Sparks book. It started out slow in the beginning but by the end I was rooting for the lovers to overcome the past. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys love stories.
1451668945|4.0|I really liked this book.This book was a bit slow for the first few chapters, but then it sucked me in and I could not stop reading it! Warning: If you do not like a lot of characters then don't read any Mary Higgins Clark book.
B007SGM084|4.0|I expected these books to be a lot more raunchy, more like a written porno.  I was surprised that there was actually a pretty good story line.  There were parts that remind me a lot of other books I've read and then there were the sex scenes.  It made the book more interesting that they had fights and arguments and didn't just fall in love at first sight. More believable.  I would definitely read more.
B0013KTGAG|2.0|This could have aired on the SyFy channel~and actually, the SyFy channel has better programming than what I watched during this movie.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Yes... I'm so happy that it is finally here for my Kindle Fire. The best thing I have made so far?? A flying rainbow robotic cow pie in a spaceship with a narwal pet and a chicken on one foot. Best. Game. Ever.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is a little slow but over all,  I like it.  The graphics are nice too. I just wish it was a little faster on my Fire.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I LOVE STONE SOUR !!!!!<br />All of the songs are great !!!!!<br />Do wish there was a few more songs that were heavier
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|After 30 years together ,Jarret, Peacock and  De Johnette make another great album. Pure, beautiful and full of sense . Recorded in Luzern in 2009 begin with a fantastic middle of \\"Deep Space from Jarrett and \\"Solar\\" from Miles Davis. After this everything is fine . \\"Stars from Alabama\\",\\" Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\", \\" Tonight\\" from Bernstein and Sondheim and \\"I though About you\\". But the real treasure is a incredible mix between \\"Somewhere\\" of Bernstein and Sondheim and \\"Everywhere\\" from Jarret. Is really magic, 19 minutes of absolute glory. Is impossible to say nothing again this CD. The Jarrett Trio is probably the best jazz trio of all jazz history. Are perfect, his music, the interaction between them, the spirit inside the music, really perfect.  Five stars. Great
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|I LOVE STONE SOUR !!!!!<br />All of the songs are great !!!!!<br />Do wish there was a few more songs that were heavier
B007ZXK08C|5.0|From the beginning, this book is a gripping and thrilling read. Entirely unpredicatable with some very clever twists. One of the best books I've read in a while!
B00BY9GQHM|4.0|I like this game, so far so good, tell you more when I finish ! Entretaining and fun ! Keep finding things.....
B003WE9TU8|3.0|I thought it was a great backdrop for a story, but I didn't like that there wasn't really a single person's tale that ran throughout. It felt like I was reading the appendices to a novel rather than the novel itself. I get that that's how the book is meant to be told, but I found it a little unsatisfying. There are some great bits told by particular eyewitnesses, but the excitement in any given account only goes for so long.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it, it's a great bible, with a lot of reference tools. I'll will share it with others. simply awesome.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I like it. its fun if you want to play it on car trips but to make it a little scary put an option for color or black and white
160941280X|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend, it took a longtime to get the audio version.  He loves it.
B009186JYI|2.0|Too much backstage banter and not enough live performance in my opinion. It is fun watching the boys playing Beatles songs in the hotel though!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card follows the earthling Ender Wiggin who as a young boy is selected to be placed in the elite international military academy so that he might one day save the earth from the buggers, an alien force that was once defeated by the great military commander Mazer Rackham. With Rackham gone and the Buggers building numbers the earth needs a new savior. Orson Scott Card creates a wonderful picture of a future in which the earth has all of its sights on a nearly hopeless war with a far advanced alien race. The transition of Ender from normal life to military school is absolutely incredible. The book never ceases to make you wonder what is going to happen next. There is nothing about this book I would change if I could. Especially with a movie in the works, I recommend this book to anyone who needs a book to read.<br /><br />-GriffynB
1582406723|5.0|This is the first TWD graphic comic book in the series by Robert Kirkman and I highly recommend it to those who are TWD fans or folks who enjoy graphic comic books.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|All three of the grandkids enjoyed this movie including grandma and grandpa! It's nice to have current movies we can see at home at the click of a button. I am basing the star rating on their opinions. Grandpa and Grandma dozed off here and there!
0439023483|5.0|I read this in less than a week. It was so good I couldn't put it down. I loved it so much more than the movie.
B001XUT6AG|4.0|I think I said it above, but I think this was the best of the original cast films (barely edging out Wrath Of Khan).<br /><br />The subtlety of the plots actually led to an ending that had some surprise to it.  A betrayal by a character we had known through several films provided a stunning turn at the end.<br /><br />We get to see Spock finally turn his vaunted Vulcan logic loose on a large conundrum, rather than the simple plots he had previously unveiled.<br /><br />Uhura finally has something to contribute, a welcome change for a great character.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is very fun and challenging. Much like temple run. It's good for all ages and boys and gurls<br /> I enjoy it to the upmost
B004856SQ8|1.0|tried on my blue-rey & CD don't know what the problem is as all my others work in the player-didn't work
B007DIQC90|5.0|This CD is really great, a different sound than I've heard for a long time. It has some great themes and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys alternative music
B000J1AGQI|5.0|As a current soldier serving in the United States Army, I feel that this movie represents who we are as a whole. The Ultimate Sacrifice is the biggest achievement ever and this movie captures it all.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Not bad when it all works. It screwed up twice on me. Once all my roads disappeared. And another time my XP points went to zero. This time nothing's happened yet. I just hope the game doesn't get strike three or I'm done playing it. Sick of 're-starting the game. But when it works its fun.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Good game in terms of hidden object games, but a little lacking on on puzzles. You just move from scene to scene with a sparkle on each object or H.O. scene. I like a little more interplay of finding your own way- not just following where they want you to go. The H.O. scenes were a good challenge though. There was a few times I had to use the hint button due to hard to find objects. That kept it engrossing. It could be a touch longer, but for the price it's worth it. If they upgraded the puzzles and the length I would easily buy the sequel and for a little higher price.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|Don't let Thrift Shop fool you - the rest of the album isn't corny fun stuff.  This guy has good flow, meaningful lyrics, and great music.  I dig it!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is great for any age. It's fun. Good game to play when you're bored. I have it on my Facebook. Glad to have it on my kindle fire as well.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I bought this bag to replace traditional bulky camera bag. It was a great purchase. I used it on 7 mile hike and was easy to carry and protected my new Nikon camera & 3 lenses.  It is easily adjustable for my husband to carry or my smaller frame.  Padding on arm straps thick and very comfortable.  Couldn't be happier with this backpack.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very addicting and fast paced game;I just can't put it down.  The game detail is awesome. It's a must for video junkies!
1401238580|5.0|Awesome comic, great packaging and mask. Ideal if you like this story. You won´t be disappointed at all. And it came in wonderful condition.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|I love this book.  Very interesting.  I think it will change the way I manage my team. (three more words.)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I actually purchased these as a gift for my mom.  It really got her into Downton Abbey and she loved being able to watch as many episodes as she wanted, without commercial interruption!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I didn't finish watching because I didn't like it at all.  Can't recommend it to anyone.  I need four words to finish my review.  Done.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love a good mystery.  This game occupies my mind and keeps me on my toes.  I really enjoy playing.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|This show is not suitable for children.  Lots of &#34;f&#34; words, gory violence, and intense racism.  I do not recommend it.
1439190275|5.0|It was appreciated to have an updated book regarding the Atkins Diet.  It's more simplified and a fast read.  I have the older versions, but was looking for a revised book to guide me and this definitely met my needs.  I still refer to my previous Atkins Diet Revolution books, but this was much needed.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Season 2 was just as good as season 1.  We can't wait for season 3 to come out, and we wish that they did more than 10 episodes a season.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It's a good reader. It works very well for opening PDFs and other products that need clear and fast reading.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|A well written book on a subject matter that is difficult to perceive. A scientic background helps in constructing arguments to validate this author's experiences.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It is consistant and accurate. It does just what I need and has a very nice design. I would recommend it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game gives the best real life experience that the quality of a game could with outstanding it being on a disc.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Except for the names being cut off on the bottom row its a great app,  7 inch Samsumg Galaxy Tab.<br /><br />My other white noise app doesn't let me mix.<br /><br />Great idea.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Not a bad game for phones/tablets.  A little unpredictable in the game play, but it makes it fun. Have fun and try not to throw your device.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham has always been my favorite and there are no better court room drama's so vividly and professionaly described as he does,and no wonder that most of his novels have been made in to movies with A production and most popular actors
B0064MGU98|5.0|The story is gripping and the actors are the best.  I look forward to watching a few episodes every night.  Love it.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|A heart wrenching story with a beautiful recovery. However, it very under-edited and hard to read without getting caught up in grammar mistakes.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is very useful. The battery life is around 9 hours depending on whether you use the surround sound or not. The range is large enough for whatever you need (even if you have to run to the bathroom). I have never had any issues with sound, in fact, it sounds very high quality. It is very comfortable and easy to adjust. I would definitely recommend this.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Fabulous book, fabulous movie. One of the few times I liked both the book and the movie. The acting is really top notch.
B00000G3PL|5.0|Love the series. Can and do watch over and over again. Great to be able to watch any time I like.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Jack Reacher is one of the best action films I have seen in a long while. I am a great fan of the Lee Child books and whilst Tom Cruise does not fit the physical description of Reacher in the books, he more than makes up for it, by being a fine actor who creates a good empathy with the audience and I think he gets the ethos of Reacher spot on. There are lots more books in the series, so here's hoping for some good sequels. Well done to all concerned in the production of this movie.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I was reasonably well entertained and surprised by the ending but I couldn't manage any empathy for the main character. The acting was just not very good.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game has beautiful graphics. It also is fun to play, I am hoping to get more friends on here.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|Although some of the scenes drag on too long this is a good movies. Some knowledge of history and Christianity a benefit. I would have never cast De Niro in this role but he was perfect. Strong stomach for martyrdom required.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|That's the reason why I have given it three stars. This movie is somewhat cute, all actors are great, but the story (or its adaptation to the screen) is just cute and meant to please audiences.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|As a long time SF and Star Trek fan, I definitely came to this with a set of expectations, mainly a humorous exploration of what keeps happening to those poor saps in the red shirts (Scotty and Uhura excepted). The book delivered on exactly that in an scenario that wouldn't feel out of place in the shows it pays homage to. The ending (pre-codas) seemed a bit rushed at first, but on review, it's really the only way to go given that the essential truths of the crew of Intrepid had been told. The codas exploration of the \\"real world\\" aftermath of colliding worlds tied the story up in a convincing way. Recommended for all SF fans as a well paced entertaining read.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the book and watching the movie was like remebering a great read. The movie did the book justice
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it's nice but wish I could turn the horse and have free play with it._ pet it more than just the nose.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|The Hobbit starts slow like The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but picks up rather quickly.  The action scenes are awesome.  Much better than the action scenes of LOTR.  I was disappointed in the ending, but that was before I learned the Hobbit was the first installment of a three part series.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Daniel Day-Lewis was excellent as Abraham Lincoln.  I expected more from Steven Spillburg.<br />It was a well made movie but I didn't like it.  It was like reading a history book.  It was hard for me to stay focused.  I think I went to sleep a couple of times.  I'm not sure I would have understood the movie if I had not known the history of Abraham Lincoln.  I don't like documentary movies without a story line.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well, this is a great game but it will not update being latest! 7.0 alpha came out for apple devices! We are peaceful my friend.
0486414124|4.0|I recently began to love reading Jane Austen after first falling in love with the BBC version of Pride & Prejudice many years ago, and am trying to expand my knowlege of other Austen works beyond P & P, Sense & Sensibility, & Emma. Although I enjoyed this book, I did find Jane's complicated ntellectual writing style somewhat incomprehensible at times so that I had to go back over a sentence more than twice to understand exactly what she was getting at.  The characters are also not as compelling as some of her other works, but they were interesting all the same.  I did have several good laughs in it as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best I get when I want to play minecraft.  I love this game but needs many upgrades and something to Get mods and skins
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Bocelli is one of our favorites.  I was surprised the CD came from a vendor in Argentina..  It didn't have the usual security seal on it biut still looks new and unplayed.  Great music.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I played a couple of the spider man games on ps3 and was a little nervous about playing it on the kindle. To my surprise it is very well set up and absolutely love this game.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is thinking about it.
1878424319|5.0|It is good to read, will help you be better person and help your business. It is a book everybody should read
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Nice story and it is always a treat to watch these &#34;old&#34; pros in action. Particularly liked Dev Patel's performance.<br /><br />Wanda Garofalo<br />Chicago
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|Just watched the three hour documentary on Showtime. Very well done and covers the complete history of the band. Every member is covered in detail, including Randy Meisner, Bernie Leadon and Don Felder, as well as many of their collaborators, such as JD Souther and Jackson Browne.<br /><br />This documentary stayed with me and I think it works best as an abject lesson about the music business, especially as it peaked in the 1970s .By the mid-70's, bands were playing arenas and stadiums, millions of dollars in revenue were being generated. Peace and love, pot and LSD, were replaced by greed, cocaine and indulgence on a new scale. The Eagles epitomized this period of the music business on the highest end of the spectrum. Glenn Frey is the archetype of the new rockstar -- driven, focused and ruthless.  Near the end of the documentary, Irving Azoff, the Eagle's manager, says: \\"You can try to be successful in the music business AND have lots of friends, and you will fail.\\" His point is that those two objectives are mutually exclusive. Glenn Frey could easily be seen as an egotistical jerk, but he made me realize that if you want to be successful in the music business, it is simply what it takes. Somebody has to be in charge, somebody has to make the hard decisions. You don't have to like it, but it is true.<br /><br />I work in the software industry and Frey reminds me of some of the executives and CEOs I have met. They are tremendously talented across all dimensions of the business, they write code, they can sell, they can do marketing, they understand finance, etc. Really amazing. They are also paid to make hard decisions and would happily throw you under a bus if it was for the good of the business. Of course, the success of the business and their personal success are highly intertwined so it is hard to tell when they are looking out for their own interests versus that of the company. But they aren't paid to be nice guys. Glenn Fey would make a great CEO.<br /><br />Frey can sing, write, play AND he gets the business side of the music industry. He is also completely honest about what he did.<br /><br />Lots of great footage from every stage of the band's life, Southern California in the 70's, concert footage, studio footage, in depth interviews with people such as Glyn Johns, David Geffen, Bob Seeger (an early friend of Frey's, who was from Detroit), and many others.<br /><br />The documentary is in two parts. The first part covers up to 1980 when the band \\"broke up.\\" It is the most interesting in my opinion. Lots of very early footage that you almost certainly have never seen. The glory days of 70's So Cal rock and roll. The second part covers the post break up period, solo careers and eventual reunion. I was never a big fan of Frey or Henley's solo work (plus it was the 80's -- trench coats, shoulder pads, electronic drums). There's footage of Frey guest starring in Miami Vice (groan!). Plus, the reunion became what most successful bands of that era have become -- an endless worldwide tour milking the hits for all the money they can. There is still a little drama to be played out -- Walsh's recovery from substance abuse and the firing of Don Felder. But let's face it, once everybody gets married and sober it is kind of boring.<br /><br />Here's my assessment of each member of the band based on the documentary (and nothing else, since I never followed the band):<br /><br />Frey - Charles in charge, either a jerk or super focused and ambitious, you decide. Fired Mesiner, Leadon and Felder. Recognized that Henley was the real star and was happy to let him take that role since it was in the best interest of the band. He is also honest about himself.<br /><br />Henley - A little sanctimonious, but not bad. Arguably the most overall talented member from a singing, songwriting and musicianship perspective. The fact that his solo career was very successful, especially in comparison to Frey, says a lot about his talent. Probably the most guarded of all the band members. I didn't feel like I got to know him.<br /><br />Meisner - Very nice guy, super talented, shy, not as ambitious as the others. Doesn't seem to harbor any ill will abut being fired form the band.<br /><br />Leadon - He just wanted to be a guitar player in a country rock band. Also seems at peace with the way things worked out.<br /><br />Walsh - The Keith Moon of the Eagles who overcame some serious substance abuse problems and now has his head on straight. There is some very unflattering footage of him post-Eagles break up where he is totally wasted and barely able to play or speak. In my opinion, the most human and interesting member of the band. Kudos to Walsh for letting all that be shown.<br /><br />Schmidt - Very down to earth, likable, got caught up in the turmoil very late in the band's career. Arguably the most normal. At one point he is being interviewed in his home and he mentions that he had to do the dishes before the crew showed up.<br /><br />Felder - Awesome guitar player who couldn't reconcile his role in the band -- talented sideman or fully equal partner. Frey saw him as a sideman, Felder felt differently. To Frey's point, he didn't sing and didn't write songs as much as the others. But Frey took a \\"my way or the highway\\" approach instead of trying to work it out.<br /><br />Irving Azoff (manager) - Very important player in the saga that kept them all together and looked out for their interests in the cutthroat music biz. Probably the only one on the business side that actually cared about the band.<br /><br />David Geffen - why the music business sucks, scumbag, leech<br /><br />Recommended.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Soothing music to listen to while playing. Gives you 3 hints if you need them. Very challenging. You'll never get bored with this one!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Holds your interest and deeply involes you in the lives of the characters. They become real to you. What a great series!
B009AMAGQM|2.0|Overall the movie was great but the DVD was scratched so it skipped.  This is the second DVD I've purchased from Amazon that the DVD was scratched.  Safe Haven was also scratched.  I'm glad I saw the movie in theatres.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really like this show because it engages you mentally and emotionally. It's funny, but intellectually so, and the drama moves at a fast-pace that keeps me pressing play. I also like the character dynamics and plot twists.
B00742GBDM|4.0|I'm a huge Jane Austen fan, so I was skeptical of this adaptation. However, like many recent versions of her books, this one captured much of the social commentary and character driven plot that I love.
B004GBIE3Y|3.0|the movie is suitable for teenagers, especially those who need a reminder to enjoy the life they have. It has its funny and its tender moments
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very challenge game. A brain storming game love it cant put it down once I g<br />et started. Everyone should have this game.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Have lived for nearly 70 years and never quite fit in. Just needed to follow what I like to do regardless of making money or not. Have tried to fit art in rather than fit other things in. It had recently been suggested that I spend at least 30 minutes a day on art. Will definitely be spending more time. Thank you for spending the effort in sharing your journey.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Easy to play; its fun and exciting game.  My daughter love it. Great game to play keep you busy.<br />A good on the go game.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Once you start reading this book, you will find it hard to put it down.  I am sure you will learn things in it that will surprise you.
0316017930|4.0|Hi, this book is pretty good, but some of his reasoning is off.  It's very entertaining though.  This isn't really a book of facts, just well-defended opinions.
B005T87QCI|5.0|this app is good if you will pay for the robots and the create a robot teacher if you don't pay for that the game is ok so it if you can pay its amazing
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I'm not gonna say I love it, but I really liked it.  It was terrific and imaginative.  Riddley Scott is at it again.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled is sooooo funny, lauged out loud so many times. The dialogue is from the males point of view. So you see the way, you probably already knew or suspected, men think about women and relationships. you will roll your eyes, but you know its the way they think.  Drew is a real hoot, and Kate is more than a challenge for him. Cannot wait until the next book in the series, hopefully its not a year from now it was that good. Enjoy.
1572814136|5.0|I gave these cards to a friend for her birthday. She connected immediately and they are so beautiful. I have an older - much older- Rider-Waite deck and I love the &#34;blown-up&#34; design.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great & simple calculator to make those quick calculations. Math is not my strong suit so I enjoy always having one handy!
1401924751|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in these cards. The art work was not congruent and some of it was, well, I'm sorry poor and immature. The cards are not good for multiple readings. I think this is a well thought out marketing plan. My friend has another set of Angel cards by Virtue, and the art work is beautiful and meaningful. You look at the word and you see it in the face/pose of the angel. These were just a easy money making fix for Ms. Virtue, nothing more. I was so excited to get these cards and deeply disappointed. I did not connect with my reading...I'm still reflecting on it, but it just doesn't seem to fit with my life. Not as it should anyway.
0307477479|5.0|a very good book, was reviewed in an israeli newspaper, (after being translated to hebrew of course,) deserves all it's prices.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Fantastic!  I can't wait for Martin's next book.  This book had huge changes for the major characters.  This one definitely leaves you wanting more.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's very funny and relative it is very cute and I love the kindle version because all the pictures and writing is very bright overall it's a great book
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I did not read the book, but my husband devoured it.  He shared many of the facts cited in the book and conveyed to me that he felt the book provided valuable information.  While we had never heard many of the facts before, they seemed to make sense.  This book is comprehensive, excellent and easy to read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This  product is fab, very addictive and I recommend it but it can be quite complicated to start with but the tutorial is great!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A great look into the inner minds of being alone. More than just a book but a way of seeing life in a different point of view.

B009MYARIK|4.0|Sophie Kinsella never disappoints.  It's a very Cute story with likable characters.  Highly recommend it, parts of it are hilarious.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This is like the only real steel game and it rocks. All of the characters have special moves used to destroy the opponent. It is not a waste of money.
B0086700CM|3.0|Fun little waste of time and battery.  Would be nice if there were more ways to leverage the power-ups or something.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Wowie.  We kept watching, but the digital quality of the movie tanked.  I am unsure why there is not an easier way to report the digital quality and request a refund.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Pretty intuitive mobile wrapper for the Pinterest web service.  Nothing shocking takes place here.  It will satisfy the need to connect  to your firehose of pictures.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Good app fun to use would recommend to any one also came with one dollar for an mp3 download which is great
B004EPYZQC|3.0|This movie is good. It was boring at times  but overall good. It had good parts in it. Fast and Furious movies are always good and if you have or have not seen the others, you should get this one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun and will give you the prophetess the spoil the prophetess and will give you a sign of Assyria to call out my father and will give you an idea of Assyria
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|Nice watch. A bit bigger than it looks but will definitely serve the purpose. Super packaging too. Will buy this again most definitely.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I got this bane because a lot of people talk about it and I thought it would be fun .... and it was! !! I couldn't belive that a driving game could be this fun I am amazed on this game you NEED to get it
B0013KTGAG|4.0|Sometimes hard to follow but worth the journey. Astronauts heading to the dying sun to set off a massive nuclear explosion in hopes to re-ignite the sun and save mankind from extinction. On their journey they encounter a lost space ship sent on a previous mission. how they react to the lost ship impacts how their mission is challenged. I enjoyed the story and the acting was excellent. Worth the rent.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|this glimpse into eternity is inspiring and love-filled with hope and promise for believers as well as skeptics. Thanks for this gift.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|This is a slow moving movie.<br />It lost my attention, and I did not even make it to the end of the movie.<br />I am not saying that you won't like it, just my vote.<br />It's okay.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Hard to beat this one. It does distinguish itself from the previous three and does not seem dated like the second one.
B00BLGZDYA|5.0|Here's one that held my attention.<br />Interesting content.  Wonderful casting.<br />Very different from the norm.<br />Watched all the way to the end,<br />and especially loved the ending.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|It's Game of Thrones!  What more can you say.  The show is awesome.  Btw, started reading the books too.  Can't put them down!
1439156816|4.0|Not just &#34;The Shining&#34; and &#34;The Green Mile,&#34; but:<br />&#34;Stand By Me.&#34;<br />&#34;Delores Claiborne.&#34;<br />&#34;The Shawshank Redemption.&#34;<br />&#34;Hearts in Atlantis.&#34;<br />&#34;Needful Things.&#34;<br />Good stuff. And the book's just as accessible and unpretentious, but full of nice nuggets. If you're aspiring, get this one and Annie Lamott's &#34;Bird by Bird.&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|What a complete let down.  I loved the first two books of this series and devoured them (reading both in less than a week).  The third book definitely 'jumped the shark' in my opinion.  It lost me, plain and simple.  Now I regret wasting the time reading the first two.  The storyline becomes thin, weak, and quite uninteresting.
B0096A9QXC|3.0|I got this for my grandson to play. He is four and most of the levels are too hard for him. He had fun with a few of them but has mostly given up trying to play at the fast pace of the upper levels.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Love Angry Birds sooo much better without the ads popping up after every scene. This is always my little one's go to game when we are out somewhere and she's bored but the ads started popping up more than ever so I had to buy the ad free version. Worth it!
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|I have followed Soderbergh's directorial career since Sex, Lies and Videotape. In my opinion, he has not made any bad films, and Che, which is really two films, the first in Cuba and the second an entirely different film in Bolivia, were his best to date.<br />Side Effects surprised me, because he was tackling a subject I knew little about. I am looking forward to his next film and expect to be surprised again.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|I didn't &#34;get it&#34; until I got stuck at the 11th puzzle for a bit, then it hit me.  The brilliance in this is not in endlessly matching 2, 3 or more rows of identical items, it's the pattern in which you unlock them that is the key to wiping out the entire level.  The little floating guide persona is cute at first but gets kinda boring after a while.  There may be too much backstory wedged into what is in essence an easy to learn but harder to master puzzle.<br /><br />Besides being a thoughtful time waster, the graphics and animations are all buttery smooth and game play is perfectly responsive.  A great effort!
0800141660|5.0|Ang Lee shows his ability to direct a Jane Austen classic as well as Chinese films. Each character in the film made a major contribution to the success of the movie. I enjoyed it and will watch it again.
B00C4YZ12C|3.0|Nice graphics, probably plays better on a tablet than a phone, though.  Using touch to drag the ship around on a 5&#34; smartphone screen isn't overly precise, but good enough to have some fun while passing the time.  Beyond that, it is very Galaga-esque, which is a good thing.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|I am way beyond muppethood and really enjoyed this one with David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly and lots of repulsive creatures.
B00CFOY244|5.0|Don't watch the previews for this movie, it has too many spoilers, but just watch it and enjoy.  I thought it was going to be a horror or syfy movie, and so I wasn't that interested, but it's a mystery, well acted, and a great story.  I really enjoyed this movie and so did my wife.  If you like an interesting drama that focuses on a well-crafted story and not 3d nonsense, this is the one.
0615782043|5.0|GPA's poems are short, sensual, and sweet. He has a way of getting into the mind of his readers and dancing with their soul. His spontaneity and precision are what gives his poems a touch of electrical energy, making them captivating, satisfying, and fun. GPA's work not only solidifies his belief that he's the greatest poet alive, it welcomes lovers of poetry to take a chance at entering GPA's world to see for themselves. His verse is beautiful and one of a kind. Every poem takes on a different meaning and life of its own. 5 stars
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It is excellent.  I even rationed out the last book because I hated for it to be over! Great book!
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|It love this album. It started when I heard \\"Still into you\\" on my 4am commute to work. I had to \\"shazam\\" it to get the song/album info because it was immediately my favorite song and that's how the album has been for me, its all I listen to now. I love it.
B000I186FW|5.0|I am not a fan of super heroes at all but I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen lately. The storyline really makes you think on what should you fight for
1592407889|5.0|Well written and so interesting.  Gave great insight into the lives of both Mother and Daughter.  I loved that she didn't have a &#34;poor me&#34; attitude, and gave warts and all.
B001ADW4UU|5.0|This was a fun movie, so I wanted to listen to the music.  This is a good soundtrack and listening to it is fun.
B005HEDI3K|4.0|For it's day and time, this show was miles ahead technologically speaking.  They had blue tooth, flip phones, and all sorts of computer technology.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is great. I wouldn't have found without amazon prime baby! :). This is definitely one of the better lawyer shows.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Thank you Mr. Fogerty for continuing to make amazing music!  I enjoy all the bands included on this album, but no mistake about it John Fogerty is the star!
B00C4QD5IW|5.0|If you love romantic period dramas, you'll love Firelight.  The plot, the chemistry between the incredible actors, and the gorgeous house/landscape create an unforgettable story.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Had to get this for my library collection.  I'm a big die hard Jurrasic Park fan and had to get this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was the first app I ever got. I loved it I still have it. Butt the prices are high. Do you get it
B00AJER3SE|5.0|My favorite Schwarzenegger movie.  Had to get this classic for my blu-ray collection.  Have the whole Terminator collection now that completes my library.
B0091XRRQC|4.0|A colorful adventure into a world full of pirates and humor. I great watch for anyone and everyone. This will stay as a download on my kindle fire.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Glad to get the Tranformer trilogy for my collection.  Ever since I got a blu-ray player, I was trying to build my collection.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I used the free version for sleep. And just love this! The best white noise app I have found so far.
0061950726|5.0|While I knew that a large contingent of English children were relocated for their safety to Canada and sent to farms during WW II, I had no idea that American orphans were also \\"redistributed\\" across the country on trains from the east coast during the Great Depression. This book sensitively parallels the plight of an elderly woman who endured being \\"adopted\\" twice into miserable situations subsequent to the death of her real family; with that of a native teenager trapped in the foster care system today. Although this plot line may sound depressing, it's not. The story is riveting and uplifting. A great read for teen girls and adult women as well as book clubs.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Age range from 3 to 9 and they all loved it.  They thought it was funny, a little bit &#34;dangerous&#34; and they loved the characters.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Wow!  Can't wait  for the  next in the  series.  Hope  I won't have  to  wait another year to see what happens next.  This  a wonderful series.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I would only recommend this to people for face book or something that you will only need a photo of yourself. I would like to be able to take a photo from either side.
1455519006|4.0|Just as Robie uttered these words my mind reached the same conclusion. And it just kept getting more complicated. The story begins with a failure by Robie to kill an assigned target, a failure rectified by a sniper who completed the kill while Robie stood over the victim. This sets Robie on a search for answers, a search that is compelling and absorbing. The author enhances the fast pace of action by use of short sentences and crisp dialogue with little introspection and self-diagnosis that grinds many thrillers to a crawl. Nor do we have pages of scene setting, wardrobe detail, and furniture design. The core of the book is non-stop action. The use of a precocious 14-year old girl adds vitality, humor, and a solid reason to care about the outcome.<br /><br />The \\"getting complicated\\" marked a turning point of sorts. The search for answers bogs down somewhat and when it finally bears fruit, and Robie begins to unravel the puzzles, the book loses some of its freshness and leaps to a conclusion that is surprisingly unremarkable. The bad guy is a man of great wealth who buys traitors in nearly every branch of the federal law enforcement community, including the FBI, Secret Service, and White House staff. After meticulous plot development, the book ends up just another Evil Rich Guy thwarted by a Super Hero without a lot of imagination.<br /><br />I give it four stars because I enjoyed the book despite my disappointment at the end, a disappointment undoubtedly caused by my thorough enjoyment of the initial 2/3 of the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I cannot wait until the new season... I have enjoyed becoming a loyal fan of this series, and can only hope that I can appease my patience by watching these episodes again and again.
1849163863|4.0|Could barely put the book down.<br />The themes:<br />  The contrast between a city crime scene and one on a remote island.<br />  The interconnectedness of people in a traditional society.<br />  The changes wrought by modern media.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Way too small. Junk. My son stopped playing with them after 10 minutes. Has no further interest in the blocks(if you can call them blocks).
0385342071|4.0|(This is the same review that I submitted to Goodreads.)<br /><br />Review may contain spoilers:<br /><br />With only a short time before her wedding, Poppy looses her wedding ring. A ring that has been in her fiance, Magnus' family for several generations! Then to make matters worse, her cell phone is stolen by a teenager on a bike. Then an absolute miracle, Poppy spots a company phone in a trashcan. Someone just threw it away. Reverting to 'finders keepers,' Poppy pockets the phone, and begins her quest to find her missing ring. A short while later, she finds out that the phone belongs to an extremely important businessman named Sam. His PA decided to quit her job, and tossed the phone in the bin. Poppy comes up with the idea of becoming Sam's unofficial PA in return that he won't turn her over to the police.<br /><br />Over the next few days, Poppy gets tangled up in a bizarre case involving Sam's company, finds out that her fiance might be cheating on her, and to make matters worse, she might be falling for Sam!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. The ending caught me by surprise. I've always enjoyed Ms. Kinsella's books, and this one is no exception
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I will admit Bella and Edward are not my favorite, Carlisle  and Esme are. But I'm tired of seeing negative reviews abput how Bella seemed to take being a newborn well insted of takin it hard like almost all newborns. Well if you paid attention to Carlisles story you will see that he starved himself for months because he didn't want to become a monster and eventually fed on animals. He was a newborn and he resisted and prevailed. Bella did too but eveyone has a problem with it. But not me. Carlisle did it so in my opinion it was fair and right for Bella too. Other than that great book wonderful story.
B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|Even if I had not read the books this movie on his own was blah. If you read the books dont even bother watching the movie, it will be very disappointing. The movie gets rid of characters and completely makes things up. I would say that this is an even worse book adaptaion than Eragon.
B007C4CJNS|5.0|This purchase was everything I needed it to be. The product was great! It got to me quickly. I was completely satisfied with the whole transaction.
B003U69IX6|5.0|I originally only saw this movie because my little brother wanted to see it and ended up loving it. Just heard a second movie is coming out and I cant wait for it
B0001MLMKY|5.0|this watch is simple, classic and perfect for daily use. Swatch has always made affordably priced and quality products. LOVE IT!
1468179993|5.0|This book inspired me to make my speeches even better! Thanks for the excellent tips! I'm reading it again to make sure I didn't miss anything!
B001NLL93W|5.0|There is action and a forbidden love story with a twist all in one book where you hope that they all live and the two love birds end up together.
B0086213XW|2.0|I was hugely disappointed in this film. We have an unsatisfied bitchy young wife  married to an adorable man who does all the cooking - and she falls for a good looking guy. Of course, after much hue and cry, she finds out that the grass is always greener. SHAME on the director for dragging out scenes! How many times do we have to see the ride sequence? And the water ballet? Basically, Margot is a tease for 3/4 of  the movie and then decides to up and leave her husband. Halfway through this movie, I looked on this site to see if I was the only one who thought that the movie sucked. Nope - many others thought the same. Why 2**? Sarah Silverman was great, and I liked the music. Oh, btw, does everyone in Toronto have turquoise sheets & shams? Also, I felt REALLY good about myself after the shower scene.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Very well done. Tough to follow at first and the script is very robotic, but done very well and they pull it off. Very exciting and I love the character that Cruise plays.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Easy to use. I've never seen another calculator for fractions. I don't need it all the time but when I do it's awesome.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I like the app a lot. It is easier than the website and I enjoy easy! It seems to be faster and you get your info in just one click
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Enjoyed this movie and learning a behind the scenes story from the Carter era hostage situation, but I don't think it's Oscar material.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were great to read, I couldn't put them down. I would recommend them to most anyone. Keep your mind open and enjoy a great fantasy.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Great, great, great movie. Simple transaction with amazon.com. Couldn't be more pleased.  I've watched it easily 30 times since purchasing it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is awesome I can't wait into I get the football player it's easiest to play on kindle fire or iPad mini
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Wonderful &#34;oldie&#34; but &#34;goodie.&#34; LOVE THIS MOVIE. Can definitely be enjoyed by all.  Also recommend Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Good read..but not up to Dan Brown's usual..would recommend it fora a summer read.Looking forward to the new book that came out..
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Was an overall great movie! From being to start was both entertaining and funny. Would definitely recommend this movie & will be watching it again.
B005I735XE|5.0|I already have Born This Way (Deluxe Edition) but this USB is PACKED with so much more! Not only does it come with the deluxe BTW, it also comes with exclusive remixes, photo-shoots, international performances, and a special link to a website (only for those with the link and code found with the USB) with even more exclusive content! If you are a Little Monster, or just want it all, this is the PERFECT gift!
B000FA5STS|4.0|I love Baldacci and felt like I had read everything he has published.  Apparently not.  He has developed his story lines and matured a great deal since this book was released.  While a very interesting story, it was over-embellished and had too many characters.
B00026ZG10|5.0|lots of action, drama, & comedy all rolled into a great movie with great stars! Truly an exciting film! A must have!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Very good n friendly game I love it ....and my daughter love it as well. .u can't get tired of playing it.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|A zany story that explains only enough to make you imagine the rest and pick up the pieces of story along the way.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Like war movies, based on real events? Good. That's what you get here. There are some moments that are hard to watch and the film is presented in a very realistic fashion. I am not a military man or expert on the actual happenings of this event, so I did not really care about people's nit-pickings on how accurately things were portrayed. It's a movie, for entertainment. This film delivered on being emotional and involving the viewer in the characters. Good flick. Well done.
B00C061HZY|5.0|A huge departure from prior albums, Random Access Memories is the sort of album that needs to be heard all the way through -- and more than once. It isn't until subsequent listens to this album that its story and vision really start to become clear. When they do, the amount of depth (backed up by a superb production) is really impressive. I admit to finding the first listen alternate between amazing and tiresome. That's not true today; every track has its place and purpose and I enjoy them all.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers: Get Lucky is a litmus test for this album. It is NOT Homework or Discovery, but without those, Daft Punk's new album would not have the same effect. This is a case of an artist earning carte blanche and creating something special.
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|More Paramore (pun intended). Before die-hard fans jump down on this review and emo hate all over it, I will say this is pretty good. It's not great. So was the release before this one and the one before that... (in my humble opinion) - Hey, have you heard their new song on the radio? Yeah. That's what you get here. Paramore. There you go.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|The twist to the story made it so interesting! The casts & characters did an awesome job portraying their roles!
B00BDSRISA|5.0|Phoenix = good music. Know this! - Love it! - Buy it! Do yourself a favor and get this album and their other releases, also. - Yes. Right now. Go.
0689853491|5.0|Someone gave my son this book when he was younger but even I used this book for inspiration when I was having hard times. I still repeat a few of the lines when times are stressful. We can't go over it, we can't go under it, we've got to go through it! Amazing book even for an adult.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This was a very well told tale of a a actual, sad, historical event. - Well, this story is probably much better that what actually happened, or maybe not... either way it is a very charming movie, that I really enjoyed watching. A purchase on Blu-ray for this title only made sense in my mind.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I watched the production on TV origanally and wanted to hear the wonderful music and see the celebration again with the family at our leisure.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This movie is very clever and charming. Good mix between comedy and romance, with some dirty jokes. I found this movie to be very fun and entertaining. Worth watching and purchasing. Blu-ray version is, of course, nice, but not necessary, unless you have a Blu-ray player, in which case I don't understand why you are still reading this and haven't already clicked the purchase button. Performances and casting choices were excellent and fit this perfect, quirky romantic comedy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an amazing game for a horse lover or for someone who wants a horse. The graphics are never blurry! I love this game!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|It's a great app with good performance, I haven't experienced a crash. The gameplay is really smooth and intuitive; and the puzzles are awesome.
B00076RT24|4.0|I really like this movie, despite what critics said and despite what\\"FAN BOYS\\" complain. People need to stop complaining about this movie and trying to compare it to the original STAR WARS movies, Specially those who saw the original star wars movies. I feel these prequels were made to introduce star wars to the new generation. Ive never knew about star wars. Not until my dad took me to watch this one when i was 10. I got hooked on star wars thanks to this movie.Quit youre complaining and enjoy this good movie.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Boring at first but got better then ended at the worst time stream was great though the director and writers could've made this movie better
B004WY2M8I|3.0|After reading the Mayfaire saga, its a nice add on to my Rice book list, after all the books have been around and I never read them
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Good story except for the bad grammar and inconsistent spelling. Many instances of words in wrong order and the spelling of leopard's name from chapter to chapter. Obviously the book was not proof read and not well edited.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|this may be cute but it keeps disconnecting<br />sooo I cannot give a correct summation<br />sorry for my and your inconvience
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is relaxing and fun. It starts off very easy then becomes more challenging. It makes you think in a way that other word and number puzzles don't.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Loved the game. Wish there were more like it! I like how it wasn't just a normal how but it made you have to do many things.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great second book and will be looking forward to reading the next.  I wasn't disappointed and keeps me interested in series.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I started watching from day one and, personally, I think this is one of the best series on TV.  It is full of great actors and intriguing from the first minute to the credits.  Very little on TV hold my attention now days, but this one is great. Love Emily; love Nolan.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Author was needy of sympathy and reckless. We all lose loved ones. Having said that the book was well written and I enjoyed being part of the trail. Go REI.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I frikkin' HATED this book. Didn't like it enough to move on to books 2 and 3. BARELY finished book one. Finished it, because I don't like NOT finishing something I have started. Plus, I have heard so much HYPE about this book, I kept reading to see if I was missing something! Nope! Got to the end and was EXTREMELY disappointed!!! I think this book is for &#34;desperate housewives!&#34; LITERALLY!!!
0375826742|5.0|she ahs read the series so many times she has all the rest so I thought I would complete her collection
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It's hundreds of years in mankind's future.  The exact point in  history is unknown, the location, a mystery.  People live in a massive silo, a structure buried deep into the ground.  They live together, yet apart.  Their only means of travel is to navigate the hundreds of flights between the varying districts.  They can communicate via computer, but even that costs them.  It almost seems as if someone doesn't want people banding together.  The citizens of the silo's only view to the outside is a tiny view screen on the upper levels, which shows an inhospitable wasteland.  Nobody knows how it got like that, nobody dares ask.  To ask is tantamount to treason.  Some people can't keep the curiosity at bay, though.  They want to know, need to know what's outside.  These are the people who pose the biggest threat to life in the silo.  For those caught even uttering wishes to go outside, to even question the status quo, they're subjected to the highest form of punishment in their pocket universe:  The Cleaning.  They're doomed to be placed in an environmental suit and clean the sensors that provides the silo with its only view of the outside.  People rail against the punishment, but they always clean the screen in the end.  All is not as it seems in this dystopian existence and it will take a few, brave souls to help pull the wool from over the population's eyes.<br /><br />It's no secret that Wool is an extremely hyped and successful book/serial.  While many times, such hype is just so much lip service, I went into Wool with an open mind and found something unique and engaging.<br /><br />Howey's dystopian/science fiction novel is fresh and interesting.  The idea of people living underground for hundreds of years with no idea as to the whys or whens is interesting in and of itself.  The society and day to day functioning in the silo, from the government, to the separation of districts by level, cleaning the viewscreen as a death sentence, and having lotteries in order tomarry and be allowed to procreate, are all explained in exacting detail which breaths life into something that most people would have a hard time imagining.  Unlike a lot of books in the sci-fi genre, there are no lazers or futuristic machinery.  In Howey's future, the tech and society isn't much unlike our own 20th century.  That makes it somewhat unique.  Also, unlike much sci fi, the silo is a backdrop to what is a human drama about hope and those willing to go against the system, regardless of what it may cost them.  It's about the human spirit and the drive to question things that don't make sense, to have the compunction to plant roots but feel compelled to explore the boundaries set before us.  Another one of the more interesting things here (without getting too spoilierish) are the 'villains'.  Even the opposition to the protagonists aren't flat out evil.  Howey skirts a lot of gray areas here and that makes for compelling reading: as more is revealed and the motivations are exposed, it's not hard to relate to any of the characters, good or bad.<br /><br />The biggest issue I had with the book (possibly because I read the whole thing in the omnibus version) is that it tends to be wordy at times.  This is especially true in the first 50% of the book, and even after that there are a few long winded sequences, filled with exacting detail of how character X gets from point A to B, that I felt could have been trimmed up some.  I found my mind wandering a bit during these passages.  Still, that doesn't take away from the fact that the author has an easy to read style that's engaging and rife with detail.  The dialogue between the varying cast is also well handled.<br /><br />If you're looking for something different, hype aside, Wool could very well be that something.  The world, the questions, the reveals, and what he puts his characters through as they fight to know more, will make you want to see what's really going on and how everything pans out.
1451673442|5.0|This is a great book, I have really enjoyed it and it's still a part of my daily life. I continue to do the exercises and it has given me a sense of peace and contentment. I also gave a copy to each of my 2 sons. It's given me a perspective that works and keeps me in a nearly continual state of thankfulness and gratitude. I find keeping a daily journal really works for me. You will enjoy it, I guarantee it!
B000FA675C|4.0|Enjoyed reading this, particularly for the intricate mystery Brown selected to drive the plot. I won't say I understood everything perfectly, but that actually made me pay close attention to what was happening on the page. No skimming for me.
1455526959|5.0|One of my favorite Harry Bosch stories to date!  I can hardly wait for the next one to be published....
B002PMPTIO|5.0|JJ Abrams did an exceptional job of recreating the franchise and bringing it a fresh and new cast that keep you engaged throughout all the action and excitement.  A New Beginning for Star Trek....
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I read the first 4 books in 2 days.  I won't give away the plot but they were fast paced and reminded me a little of a magical version of a Ranger's Apprentice.  It was so sad when I hit book 4 but luckily I didn't have to wait long for book 5 to come out.  Thanks for a great read!
B007SNG6IC|5.0|A very though provoking film with excellent acting and cinematography.  Really makes you think about how much we take for granted in life everyday.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|i liked this a lot plenty twists and turns good story line and very good acting would rent it again
B00AEFYS8G|5.0|If you have the attention span of a 2 year old then this movie isn't for you. If you're prepared to give it a chance (unlike the 1 star reviews...) then you'll be rewarded with a true classic.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|this was a cute and very funny movie i liked it very much nice story line and good acting as well
B005JS7VTQ|5.0|I grew up listening to The Doobie Brothers and this album put some of my favorites altogether! Buy it now!
1608871452|5.0|This book is truly essential for anyone who is a fan of Supernatural. It's full of beautifully colored clear pictures that are just magnificent. Along with them there are little postcards, posters, and stickers here and there for you to enjoy either inside or out of the book. There are fun little tid bits about the show, behind the scenes, and a wonderfully written introduction by none other then the creator himself Eric Kripke. This is the best Supernatural book so far, definitely worth every penny.
B00BDZV9M4|3.0|This album is OK but not as good as some of his others. Still Lil Wayne is Lil Wayne - with awesome lyrics.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The game is fun. I just wish it was easier to get acorns and faster to get coins sometimes the screen freezes. But overall the game is pretty good. I recommended it for a good way to pass the time.
B00006AW63|4.0|This is a classic. Bought it for my granddaughter and she loves to watch the puppies in action. Buy it!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|A wonderful look at how politicians used to interact with each other, and James Spader provides just enough comic relief to keep the movie from being completely heavy and dry.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I clipped it to the desk portion of my walking treadmill so I can do work while on the treadmill.  I was VERY concerned that the constant motion of the treadmill would cause the arm to start drooping - that has not happened.  I really like this arm.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This entire series is fun and takes you into another mythological world.  I enjoy the quick quips between brother and sister as well as the adventures they find themselves in.  My son and daughter are planning on reading this series during the summer as part of their reading challenge and I think it will be a lot of fun for them!
B008QE9XD2|3.0|I loved Dark Shadows when I was a child.  I would hurry home from school to watch the next segment.  Yes, it was campy but I loved it.  I also read all the books on Dark Shadows.<br /><br />This movie is cute and they did a good job.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|read all about Rachel who cannot accept she has a drug habit and goes to rehab and to stay with her mad family a good read
0670026557|5.0|This book contains so much more insight and information than I expected when I ordered it.  Not only are there tips and techniques for sales people but there are unique perspectives that would interest teachers and anyone in management.  I love it when I get more than I expected!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|This book was to be the third book of a trilogy.  The reader is left wondering what happens next and that is not supposed to be.  The third book in a trilogy is supposed to finish the story. . . right?  The reader is left hanging and if I had known this, I might have waited to purchase his last book of the trilogy when Mr. Archer publishes the next book which will undoubtedly be a follow up. Feeling just a little deceived by Mr. Archer.
B003O86FMW|4.0|but not as good as the first book. Whereas the first book seemed probable, the second seemed not as much. The relationships seemed overwrought.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Wow! Loved it. A big fan of efficiency, but sometimes natural balance is too efficient for us to meddle with.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Seriously someone told me sookie died in this book before I read it. Lol not the case. I thought it was a good book and people should get over the ending if the didn't like it. They didn't write the book Charlaine Harris did and she did an amazing job all these years. If you didn't like it write something better yourself.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I'm surprised this is the FAOTD because i use this one nightly to sleep.  I have just the right combination picked out to where I'm asleep in 20min or less every time.  I paid full price for this app but I have no regrets.  I hope anyone who needs a sleep app takes advantage of this one while its free.  The interface is really nice and its easy to use, so don't think twice on this one, there will be no need to search for another one ever. It's a little heavy on the rain types, but the ability to mix and match any number of combinations makes up for it. Personally, this is one of the better FAOTD apps that have been featured in a long time.  This is a legit app, no ads and no bs.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Maybe Mr Brown's best. Intrigue, betrayal, dedication, hate and love in a world of espionage and cryptography spiced with exotic setting and heart-stopping chases make this novel a real page-tuner. Be prepared to read it in one sitting.<br />Caveat for the readers who speak Spanish: Mr Brown's liberal use of that language is fraught with annoying mistakes. The editor should have spotted that. Don't let that spoil your enjoyment.<br />Way better than the Langdon series. Uncanny prediction of Google Glass.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|What's can I say, it's angry birds. A good game all around. I quite enjoy playing it in between meetings or while waiting on public transit, or before I go to bed. Ad-free is also nice.
0071390111|5.0|Every chapter gives you an updated and a brilliant pedagogical presentations of Neural Science.<br />Written by the most respected scientists in every domain.
B009JZVT70|5.0|LIKE ALL SHOWS, IT HAS TO KEEP YOU WANTING TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. THE ACTING IS GOOD EVERY CHARACTER DOES HIS OR HER PART. THE FANTASY CHARACTERS ARE A LITTLE OUT THERE COMPARED TO THE ONES FROM REALITY WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I loved this show, never missed an episode. I will re-watch it on DVD this summer when there is nothing else on
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a great app and recommend it for people who like games like candy crush and bejewled... Have fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter loves this game it really keeps her entertained.  She likes to get prizes on the levels. She recommends it to kids 7 and up.
B0012CCNUU|5.0|Downloaded this album for the long memorial day weekend and enjoyed it the whole time. Both our sons and their girlfriends wanted to know who we were playing?  They Really liked it. Ended up being the soundtrack for the trip. We had no service where we were camping, so they were gonna download it as soon<br />As they had service again. Just great music, done by the very BEST.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Solid story telling with some good twists.  I found myself going back and forth in regards to Jacob's innocence or guilt.  The plot is solid and the story is told in a unique way.  Defending Jacob is definitely worth reading.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|First time I watched it I was not as good as the second time.  A very good Bond movie and a little history lesson about Bond and how the series came to Moneypenny and M.  I think Daniel Craig is incredible as Bond.  More true to Bond of the novel and Shaun Connery.  I can only hope we see many more Craig/Bond movies.  If you've never seen Bond this is a perfect start.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I thought it was a great movie, my wife and I both enjoyed it. If they had placed a few nude scenes, it would've been totally appropriate. Not in a piggish way. You be the judge.
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|The talents of both actors are wasted in a boring, predictable, less than suspense filled movie.  Disappointed.  Would only recommend to those who love Walberg and Crowe.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|We had a movie night, and enjoyed this movie. I was looking for a better ending. Although, it did give a better understanding of how our history play out.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I enjoy playing this when I have the time to try and increase my skills. I have always been challenged with eye coordination. Nice workout.
6305212112|4.0|for our library of fun that we are starting for the camp trailer<br />its a must have in my mind
B00CRQV1TY|4.0|Mostly John Fogerty is letting his country flag fly on Wrote A Song For Everyone. His roots are country and he's letting that flag fly big time on this album. Even though CCR was considered rock, they were always just on that country edge of rock. The country knob is turned up a lot, not to eleven, but more like six or seven. If you are a hard core Fogerty fan, and don't care for country - pass this album by. If your music taste includes country, this album will be heaven.<br /><br />Fogerty had nothing but fun making this album. It sounds like he found friends that would play on each track and they just had a great time in the studio making this. Is this really great music? Not really. The album is a fun interpretation of Fogerty's music by Fogerty and friends.<br /><br />I've heard the original versions so much. I was expecting to really dislike this album. I love the originals, who is John to go and change them up? I'm not the biggest country fan in the world. Seriously John, you are messing with songs I love in a genre I don't care for. Well after listening to this album, I kind of like it. I appreciate what Fogerty was trying to do. He wanted to break free of that rock and roll mold and embrace his country roots.<br /><br />It was fun to remind myself of the original songs with \\"The Long Road Home\\", 2005 compilation of CCR songs. The back to back comparison was interesting mostly pleasant and sometimes painful (a few of the new versions are not exactly stellar).<br /><br />Fortunate Son with Foo Fighters. Dave Grohl put a ton of growl in this song. In Foo Fighters fashion, this moves at a million miles faster than the original. Grohl and Fogerty sound pretty good together. Grohl brings his rasp and screaming, Fogerty goes for the higher tones. There is a lot more drum in this version, and they are pushing the song a bit too hard. Not bad. The album opens with this song and it is the least country of all.<br /><br />Almost Saturday Night with Keith Urban. A banjo moved this to the country side a bit more than the original. Urban and Fogerty sound great together. Sounds like they just had a good time doing this song. There is a little too much doo whap singing in the background. Really clean detailed recording - can almost hear the pick on the banjo. Listening to the original back to back, I actually like this version a bit better.<br /><br />Lodi with Shane and Tyler Fogerty. Completely new take on this song, nothing like the original. Sounds like Proud Mary met CCR and they made a song. This is probably what was in John's head when he wrote the song. Not sure I love this<br /><br />Mystic Highway - Fogerty solo. Really nice song. Sounds a bit like Pure Prairie League, Amie (that's a good thing). A happy sweet song, great harmony in the chorus. Good road song. About three quarters in the song jumps into some gospel singing. Not a great interlude for many listens. The first time around, this is fine.<br /><br />Wrote A Song For Everyone with Miranda Lambert and Tom Morello. I read that Fogerty and Miranda Lambert were recording this song. It was time for the \\"hippie\\" guitar solo. Fogerty just couldn't do it; he was trying to sound like Tom Morello. He decided to just call Tom up and have him do the solo. And here we have it. Well Miranda bellows full-fledged country. Full blown Dolly Parton / Tammy Wynette twang John slowed this song down a lot. Miranda and John sound good together. The guitar solo is unmistakable Morello. Lots of gymnastics, he tries to move the beat up a little. The song settles back into the country mode for those last bits.<br /><br />Bad Moon Rising with Zac Brown Band - hootenanny! Turned this song into a foot stomping country song. This would probably sound great in a bar with a lot of people singing along and lots of spirits served.<br /><br />Long As I Can See The Light with My Morning Jacket. John moved this song forward a lot of years, slowed it down a lot. Not sure he really moved it up to the 2010's it seems to have taken a detour in the late 90's. The song lays in a little bit of blues, a little Dr. John influence.<br /><br />Born On The Bayou with Kid Rock. The opening is identical, the same sounds sweep and identical guitar playing. In fact the song is virtually identical to the original, save Kid Rock as the lead singer (not really a great thing compared to Fogerty a lot of years ago). Then they throw in some strange high pitched voice singing \\"born on the bayou\\" that sounds like disco or some crazy pop production singing. Wow that is really weird, not exactly pleasant. Kid Rock growls out most of the lyrics. Honestly, Kid Rock trashed this song. This is the worst song on the album.<br /><br />Train Of Fools Fogerty solo. Fogerty does a great job with road songs. I like the guitar; he leaves the pure hard core country behind. The back beat is like a train rolling down the tracks. Good solid dirty song, best of the album.<br /><br />Someday Never Comes with Dawes. Oh Dawes and John Fogerty is a match made in heaven. This song isn't dramatically different from the original. Taylor Goldsmith and Fogerty sound fantastic together. Dawes is just about the more perfect backing band for this song. The instruments are better defined in this version, the acoustic guitar, slide guitar, Fogerty's Strat, piano, and drums are much clearer, taking turns during the song. I like this version better than the original. It has room to think, instead of driving forward hard. Without question the best song on the album.<br /><br />Who'll Stop The Rain with Bob Seger. Yeah Bob Seger can't seem to do much other than Night Moves. Seger's voice is a lot darker and deeper - he struggles a bit. This is a mash up of Night Moves and Who'll Stop The Rain, hard to imagine how that could possibly work, it just does. Seger and Fogerty are roughly the same age. Seger was ridden a bit harder and put away a bit wetter, Fogerty's voice has held up better. In an incredibly strange way, this song works. I hate Bob Seger; I always disliked Night Moves when it was popular. I loved Who'll Stop The Rain. Hard to believe this works. Oddly I listened to the original, and Night Moves isn't that far off. I can see how Seger would do this.<br /><br />Hot Rod Heart with Brad Paisley. Paisley is a fine guitarist. Another road song that Fogerty just knows how to do so well. Brad and John sound good together. The country knob got turned up a little bit, not too far.<br />Have You Ever Seen The Rain with Alan Jackson. Equipped with full blown slide guitar and fiddle, this goes way south. Well Alan Jackson is about as country as they come. His voice isn't nearly as deep as Trace Adkins or Blake Shelton, but it is down there. John and Alan don't sound great together. Independently they are wonderful, great tones, just not together.<br /><br />Proud Mary with Jennifer Hudson, Allen Toussaint and Rebirth Brass Band. Wow what an unusual version of this song. Jennifer Hudson has a beautiful voice; she brings in some deep beautiful gospel sound laced with blues. Just after the simple beginning of the song, it sounds like the song would turn hootenanny with slide guitar. That was a short odd moment; instead the song goes a great direction. This big band playing the background is just plain fun.<br /><br />Technically this is a perfectly recorded album. If nothing else, the original songs were improved by over forty years recording technology improvements.<br /><br />This is a good album. I'm not a country convert after listening to this. I appreciate what Fogerty is doing, honoring his country roots and having some fun. This would be an album I would probably pick and choose to download instead of the whole album. The preview clips are an excellent indication of where Fogerty and his guest artists took a song. If that preview sounds good, that's a great song. If it just sounds too strange, well then that is a pass. The Bob Seger, rendition of Who'll Stop The Rain is well worth previewing.s song works.

B00BPWDMP2|5.0|This CD is amazing - I have all their music and never get tired of listening to them.  I hope they keep the music coming.
0765325950|5.0|The Wheel of Time series which I now have the complete set is a fantasy buff's dream come true. We lost a gifted writer when we lost Robert Jordan.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Big plot twist, great book. Don't read if you have childhood issues..... last half of the book is really emotional with a lot of long winded thought process. I did enjoy it though
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Having read the complete series of books to date, I am very pleased with the production on film.The battle scenes are great.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Their best so far. Also a very well done journey of musi throughout the album. Here almost every song is one to remember and youc an hear it over and over again. Powerful songs and also melodic, some calm, some stir up a good storm.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|very well written book.  informative and interesting even for someone who has never run a race!  it made me want to learn how to.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|This movie was fast paced, exciting and definitely worth the rental fee.  I don't usually like action movies but this one kept me engaged the entire time.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|It keeps your mind alert and yet it is a simple matching game. It will keep you coming back over and over.
B008XFJEE2|4.0|Got some good parts and some not so good.  It's worth watching if you don't have anything else too pressing.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|They are simple exercises and don't really take very long. If I can do them, you can too. I wiil.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|I like Shia as an actor. I thought that this movie had everything that a &#34;Blockbuster&#34; should have. There was nothing special about it, but it was entertaining.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I didn't expect to be so compelled to watch this entire series. I have always liked Damian Lewis as an actor but he is just part of the reason I was glued to Amazon to watch the entire series. The show is an elevation of television character development and storylining so far above almost anything else I've ever seen produced for tv. It's a quantum leap forward.<br /><br />I am not a fan of suspense novels or films, although maybe I will be now. I was simply drawn to the characters and very satisfied at the way the writers sustained the suspense.<br /><br />Great stuff.
B0090EJ99A|2.0|I didn't realyl care for this movie. It was crass, but that's it. I love raunchy humor, but this just wasn't that funny.
B00004VVNB|5.0|this is a birthday gift from my fiancé.  it has not arrived yet.  this is my most favorite movie.  can't wait to share it with others.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have daughters, and one thing you should know is that ladies love horses!  Even virtual horses!  They beg me for time on the phone to muck the stall, show the horse, and brush the horse.  Very funny to hear them ask!
B000063UR1|5.0|this is a gift from my fiancé for my birthday.  it has not arrived yet, should be here very soon......can't wait to see this again, it is one of  my favorite movies.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|I liked this movie. Good story, and good action, which is my favorite genre. Glad I watched it. Like many have said, Arnold has definitely slowed down some, as is to be expected, but he doesn't disappoint either. Several good actors and actresses in this movie. If you like good action movies, get this one. It does start out slow, but it's still good all the way.
B00CW665VI|5.0|\\"After this? Heaven's going to be a major disappointment.\\"<br /><br />Where do I even begin with reviewing Tangled? Because I am sure, unless you live under a rock (not that there is anything wrong with that), you have already heard all about how completely awesome this books is. The last thing you need is for another book blogger to come along to tell you that you must read it. Yeah well, guess what? That is EXACTLY what I plan on doing because this book is one not to be missed.<br /><br />So, just in case you are the one person who has not yet heard about Tangled.. yes you, you know who you are.. Think of this as a your own personal review. A review written to get YOU to buy and read Tangled, because again.. you do NOT want to miss this.<br /><br />\\"Then I flip Kate the finger. Immature, I know, but apparently we're now both functioning at the preschool level, so I'm guessing it's okay. Kate sneers at me. Then she mouths, You wish. Well--she's got me there, now doesn't she?\\"<br /><br />Tangled is so completely unique. I mean yeah, we all know the story... the lifelong bachelor, player, womaniser who meets the beautiful, charming, sexy woman who he can finally see himself settling down with. But what you have never read, what is so very unique about Tangled, and what makes it stand out from the rest? The writing. Plan and simple. The writing.<br /><br />\\"Newsflash, ladies: We can't read your thoughts. And frankly, I'm not entirely sure I'd want to. The female mind is a scary place to be.\\"<br /><br />Drew's voice is so very authentic and just... real. The way Emma Chase tells the story is unlike anything I have ever read. The story is told in 1st person, following Drew but it is much more than that. Drew is constantly stopping the story to point out something to you the reader. Here is an example.<br /><br />\\"I just got my MBA and start a new job on Monday.\\"<br /><br />\\"Really? What a coincidence. I'm a finance guy myself. Maybe you've heard of my firm? Evans, Reinhart and Fisher?\\" We're the hottest boutique investment bank in the city, so I'm sure she's duly impressed.<br /><br />Let's just pause here again, shall we?<br /><br />Did you see the rounding of this gorgeous woman's mouth when I told her where I am employed? Did you see the widening of her eyes? That should have told me something.<br /><br />But I didn't notice at the time-I was too busy checking out her t*ts. They're perfect, by the way. Smaller than what I usually go for, no more than a handful. But as far as I'm concerned, a handful's all you need.<br /><br />My point is, remember that look of surprise-that will make sense later on. Now, back to the conversation.<br /><br />\\"We have so much in common,\\" I say. \\"We're both in business, we both like a good red... I think we owe it to ourselves to see where this could go tonight.\\"<br /><br />See what I mean? To me this is pretty darn unique, and I for one have never read a book like it. It made Drew feel not only real, but like he was somebody I knew. To have the character interact with the reader is pure genius. I could easily see Tangled turned into a film. The use of voice-overs where Drew stops the story. You can just see the action playing out, then the entire scene freezes while Drew points out something to you, then the action picks up again. Honestly, it made the story so entertaining and fun.<br /><br />I can't even remember the last time I laughed and grinned like a crazy idiot this much. I started Tangled immediately after work and finished it at 3:00am. Yes I had work the next day, and no I didn't care. There was no way I was going to be able to put it down. My only problem was lying in bed next to my sleeping husband. I was laughing so hard, I have no idea how I didn't wake him up.<br /><br />\\"For those ladies out there who are listening, let me give you some free advice: If a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel, or any other generic endearment? Don't make the mistake of thinking he's so into you, he's already thinking up pet names.<br /><br />It's because he can't or doesn't care to remember your actual name.\\"<br /><br />And Drew... *sigh* Drew... He is something else. A real cad, scoundrel, and whatever word you can use to describe him but in the end, as romantic, loving and sweet as they come. My favorite kind of guy. And Kate? Oh, how I would love this story from Kate's point of view. We all know how much I love the guy's perspective, and I absolutely love that this is from Drew's but I would love to get in Kate's head. To see everything Drew was doing to win her over from her eyes, that would be so much fun.<br /><br />\\"You're not like anyone I've ever known. I want to be with you... really be with you. Only you. I've never felt this way about anyone. And I know I sound like a freaking Hallmark card, but it's true. I've never wanted all the things I want to have when I'm with you.\\"<br /><br />So, as of right now Goodreads has Tangled listed as a series. Yes, you have read that right, and I could not be any more excited. However, what it does not mention is if Twisted, book two, will be following Drew and Kate or if some of the secondary characters will be getting their own stories. Either way, I will read it. Emma Chase has proven herself to be a fantastic author, and I have no doubt the follow-up will be just as amazing. Plus, the secondary characters in Tangled were hilarious, so I am sure any of them would make for a great read.<br /><br />\\"Old women have a thing for me. And I don't mean a pinch-my-cheek, pat-my-head kind of thing. I mean a grab-my-a**, rub-my-junk, why-don't-you-push-my-wheelchair-into-the-broom-closet-so-we-can-get-nasty kind of thing.<br /><br />It's disturbing.\\"<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readsinking he's so into you, he's already thinking up pet names.<br /><br />It's because he can't or doesn't care to remember your actual name.\\"<br /><br />And Drew... *sigh* Drew...

I've never wanted all the things I want to have when I'm with you.\\"<br /><br />So, as of right now Goodreads has Tangled listed as a series. Yes, you have read that right, and I could not be any more excited. However, what it does not mention is if Twisted, book two, will be following Drew and Kate or if some of the secondary characters will be getting their own stories. Either way, I will read it. Emma Chase has proven herself to be a fantastic author, and I have no doubt the follow-up will be just as amazing. Plus, the secondary characters in Tangled were hilarious, so I am sure any of them would make for a great read.<br /><br />\\"Old women have a thing for me. And I don't mean a pinch-my-cheek, pat-my-head kind of thing. I mean a grab-my-a**, rub-my-junk, why-don't-you-push-my-wheelchair-into-the-broom-closet-so-we-can-get-nasty kind of thing.<br /><br />It's disturbing.\\"<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Reads
B0011HF6GE|5.0|Fantastic album. Some of the autotune that was added to the voice bothered me a little bit, but considering where and how the album was made, there's no need to be overly critical of that. The album is very smooth and soothing and Bon Iver is a great artist indeed.
B00CLVF2N6|5.0|Love this movie, can't wait to se e if they make another. the action and effects are off the hook!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Marcus Mumford is so honest and truthful in his lyrics and the songs that he writes, that I don't see how you couldn't love the stuff. This album is solid all the way through and is filled with lyrics that will make you think and wonder about a lot of different things. Very solid album that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for some solid, honest music to listen to.
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|Good story, great effects and the love interests cracks me up! He talks some s*** and is funny as hell!
0738737909|5.0|My oh my, I just have to say...!... you know, I don't usually write reviews, but I must say that this deck is absolutely one of a kind and I'm extremely happy I've purchased it. It is so beautiful that I will buy the deck itself when it comes out in September to save it in my collection. I know, that sounds like a bit much, but the fact is that the authors deserve the highest compliments in designing a masterpiece deck of tarot cards like this one. The cards feel good in your hand; nice weight with a soft flat texture, and the detail and colours are exceptional. Buy it. Don't think about it. Just buy it...
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this series from the Hunger Games and especially enjoyed reading it on my Kindle app! Worth the read!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This girl katniss to me is simply amazing. She feels she has to take the weight of everyone around her and keep them safe. I am almost finished. Its a great read and I hope the movie will be also.
B001TH16DI|1.0|These are not the directors cuts..they are the original movies, so its a mixed bag..the first Star Trek movie in Blu-ray and in its original version is HORRIBLE...I remember now how disappointed I was when it came out in 1979 &#34;10 years of waiting for that?!&#34;<br /><br />If you really need Blu-ray, buy the good movies individually..II, III, IV and VI..the others are a waste..the directors editions from 10 years ago are still better entertainment
B007FEFLTO|4.0|At first, I thought the book somewhat simplistic, but I did keep reading it.  Interesting characters to highlight this period of history from different countries points of view.  Was pretty good after all.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The best written series ever! So many science jokes and involved sentences about particle theory! This is what TV should all be like. What a vibrant cast! So much friction!
B006W0QR1S|3.0|This is the type of film where it really doesn't make a lot of sense to point out what doesn't make a lot of sense. People who have just been stabbed in the chest rarely drive merrily off, for example.<br /><br />The good: Albert Brooks. Excellent. He makes Steve Martin's performance in The Spanish Prisoner look like a bad SNL skit.<br /><br />The questionable: I think I get the director's intent. Standard action flick, BUT we're going to shoot it different. Different lighting and, most important, different pacing. Problem is: the pacing's all wrong for this kind of flick.<br /><br />The highly questionable: I'm a big fan of Gosling's, but he's no heavy. (He's a driver!) This is a role that called for a Jason Patric type, which he ain't. (Sure makes you appreciate Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, though.)
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Better than the theatre version. More dark forest, more light comedy, more saga. The Hobbit deserves a prolonged treatment over many years and a trail of quailed creatures.
B00BN3DPQ4|1.0|The movie started out fine easing into the story and Arnold character. Then we're thrown into what seemed like a seperate movie that took place in the city with the FBI chasing down an escaped convict. Now this area of the movie took up nearly the whole middle of the film, a huge boring car chase. Arnold pops up again toward the end for the big finale but at the point I didn't even care anymore and wanted it to be over. I disagree with those who are saying it's a goood comback movie for Arnie, it was weak. He deserves a funnier, more involved script than this.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|A bit too much drinking and awkward sexual trouble for the average family I suspect but full of puns and meaningful looks. I love Ms. Hannigan's smiles and her husband's confusion over trivial things. Life for the loveable NY dolts seems to be be great!
0385528752|5.0|If you combine this book with &#34;Getting Things Done&#34; and a motivation book of your choosing you might just be onto a path of substantive change in your life.
B00AOCZOLO|4.0|Better than Season 1, which was very good; the ensemble have found their places, established their characters, and create comedic havoc. Very well written. Full of lively acting and odd situations.
B002IR3PSC|4.0|Disappointed the video was so short.  The video covers only about 35 minutes of the concern. The audio and music was great.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Another brilliant collection of adventures that both the autistic and the socially awkward can thrill to and identify with! Even normal folk will laugh at the frailities of the abnormal minds trying to make a go of it in a society that isn't for them. Better than the Beverly Hillbillies!.
B00C061I3K|5.0|05.23.2013 - Daft Punk - Random Access Memories - Review by Trevor Meyer<br /><br />Mozart (would be - Doin' It Right). To me, it seems as though Mozart has been reborn, because if he were alive today, he would most definitely be avant-garde and yet, it is undeniable that he would be bound to orchestration. So here we have it, the music of the greatest composer ever to live, giving us music that is both avant-garde and with an orchestra. They have really put together an amazing ensemble of talent to help them with this album.<br />Of course Daft Punk is all about making one move to the music, and for their theme they picked 1960's California Cool. And it's not that they just nailed it, but it is so much more than that.<br /><br />Oddly, I will begin with track #9; Beyond. Wow, what a beginning of a song. An explosion and it is masterful, DP uses the orchestra to just unleash in a sweeping exploit of power and energy. The bridge moves into a slow jam that later brings in the orchestra again. To me, it is obviously that DP is giving so many DJ's and the likes a full score of music so that they can mix, mash and re-mix this song over and over again. The orchestra is so wonderful to have here. \\"The end and the beginning - love and the journey of the soul,\\" this song encapsulates all that is within these lyrics and it does it so through the lyrics AND the music.<br /><br />Daft Punk as we all know have revolutionized the world of music and continue to do so with this album, but where they top - even themselves is in their medleys. At around 3:30 in this song, I got excited, I knew that DP was setting up a new medley in-wait; it's a nice slow bubbly bit and I hope they bridge and mix it into a \\"Brainwasher\\" bit that will give us the superfluously high and lows that we all love, look forward to and feel while at or listening to DP live.<br />This song is so tight, it is so clean, it's wonderful to listen to all that is (or is not) between the notes, that's how amazing thissong is.<br /><br />Track #1; Give Life Back to Music. The intro is definitely an intro. It sounds as though you are watching a 1960's TV show about space exploration. The title of the song is \\"Give Life (Back to Music),\\" and right from the get, DP shows  their brilliant use of less is more. As a great haiku is about showing and not telling, they start their new album with giving life. They give new life to us with wonderful music, it is - yes, a throwback to the `60's and yet, it being DP, it is also futuristic.<br /><br />Track #2; The Game of Love. Well, let us get right down into it. DP is and has always been about music and making love. References like \\"Digital Love\\" (from their Discovery album) and \\"Make Love\\" (from their Human After All album) make this song \\"fitting.\\" It has a nice subtextual flow and rhythm, you shan't be disappointed.<br /><br />Track #3; Giorgio by Moroder. Like \\"Teachers\\" (from their Homework album,) it has a very nice and respectful introduction from (therefore - towards) Giorgio Moroder, and after his intro the rest of the song is such a solid showing of his use of a click, manipulations of sounds and freedom from ironically a single \\"click,\\" and through that single click(ing), we get to hear DP give us a boundless expression of beautiful music.<br /><br />Track #4; Within. Chilly Gonzales has a wonderful solo piano introduction here that is exploratory, with much that is \\"said\\" within the keys/notes that are played, it is very clean, uniformed, playful and adheres wonderfully to the song. A great use of catharsis, where you get to explore as we all do, asking questions for and about life, ourselves and having and giving/consoling insight. I'd like to say that this emotively expressed all of high school for me, but it did more than that, as it is also moving as a 39 year old man having a great best friend in my life that I like to share whatever I can with. I cherish my wife and my best friend as I do this song.<br /><br />Track #5; Instant Crush. The aforementioned song resurfaced emotions of being in high school. But I mean, \\"Come on!,\\" this song is amazing. Julian Casablancas voice is, is, it is perfect, fore you could not find a better voice to fit. It is, the wonderful exploration of your high school crush when you actually get time and space alone with your early \\"Instant Crush.\\" The music is slow, soft, but has energy to it. The voice is soft and has a lowered background voice that mixes so well with the beginning pace of this song and Casablancas' high pitched voice throughout the song is dreamy, exacting and so melodic. I believe this is my favorite song on the album (so far). But don't be afraid to listen to this song and dance with someone else or at least sing it with your arm around the shoulder of a friend.<br /><br />Track #6; Lose Yourself to Dance. Pharrell Williams' voice on this is just great, once again, it gives and adds to the song perfectly. All of the players in this song collaborate in such a way that every note is where it should be - they all shine in this fun clap-along dance song.<br /><br />Track #7; Touch. The robots travel, and are interested, they talk of touch, with the digitized popping voice that remembers touch. Paul Williams Jr. voice is waning or intrepid in the beginning and then it becomes more commanding as he remembers what he wants - love. Piercing, passionate love.<br /><br />Track #8; Get Lucky. Putting an explanation point on the point that I have been making. DP brings it all together with this 1960's California cool, love making song. It is a fun funky song that pops, and will help get you from the dance floor to elsewhere. Ph Whilliams voice is in sync with the feel of the album and certainly leads this good luck feeling song, this will be the theme song for the summer nights for we who like getting lucky.<br /><br />Track #10; Motherboard. This music is so moving, now - I love the use of the orchestra, but before the orchestra starts in this music, DP shows how critical they are of themselves, their standards make them a one-off, a stand alone. They are capable and able to have and keep the big picture in mind while giving us the best with spot specific attention to details. As each instrument is introduced it gives it's own importance and yet does not detract from the music on a whole. It is a peek around the corner, bubbly, surprised, song that is allowing you to come in, welcoming, then  the orchestra tips its toe into the water, which then has a bluster that cuts through the middle of the song. It does not rip it apart to detract, it just has music on both sides of that bluster. then as that bluster continues, memories are both made and accessed from where you have been, where you want to go, and THEN it gives you a punctuation with a sizzle that gives you the freedom and boundlessness that makes people feel free and alive. It kindly walks you back to the path and lets you walk away as you like, as you please. Really moving music.<br /><br />Track #11; Fragments of Time. Well, before the lyrics even start, you feel either, \\"Damn!, I wish I had a convertible so that I could listen to this song with the top down.\\" Or, \\"I am really glad that I get to listen to this song in my car so that it can consume me as I drive down the road.\\" Funny enough the first line is \\"Driving this road down to paradise,\\" I mean, come on, it is just so perfect. How does DP do it? How do the let us know how to feel without even telling us with words? I don't know, because they constantly do, and then as if to show off, they then add the lyrics. And you say to yourself - \\"You jerks (DP) I was just thinking that!\\" They are amazing, this is one of the many things that makes them so unbelieveable, their attention to details gives so much, so much to little this and that's and yet they always give to the big picture or song in general.<br /><br />Doin' it Right = MY FAVORITE TRACK ON THIS ALBUM.<br />Track #12; Doin' it Right. This song has a nice even flow, slow motion, the playful mix between the robot voice \\"doin' it right,\\" and Panda Bear is as mentioned playful. It is as though the two are meshing together, and like sex, when one finishes and you know that you have done it right, the song ends with Panda Bear finishing with single bass line and the lyrics of \\"if - you - lose - your - way - tonight, - that's - how - you - know - that - the - magic's - right.\\" I mean, come on!, it's so good.<br /><br />Track #13; Contact. This song kind of brings it all together, and while that might be a bit reaching, the song does have quite a bit going on. You will notice the drums, which sound as though they are a real drum set being played, not synth drums, but of course the synthesizer is also prevalent, the song is real and synth music, the title is \\"Contact,\\" it is at the end of the album, so it is the end, and yet the contact is the beginning. It left me wanting more, and I do want more.<br />As I have mentioned, Mozart has been reborn, and we should appreciate this type of brilliance when it is in our presence. DP - masters of the medley - I cannot wait for DP to tour.<br /><br />People, I wrote such a long review because it has basically been acknowledged that only through classical music could you get or relate any human emotion that one could have. But here Daft Punk's Random Access Memories has been able to do just that. I do not mean that every single piece of classical music should or can fill you with every emotion possible, but for whatever emotion that you feel, I am sure that there is a classical piece that can correspond to that emotion. So, what I am getting at is that DP's RAM is moving, and it should be able to move you and once you have listened to this album, from here on out, when you may Randomly Access your Memories and when  you and your emotions call upon this music - it will come as perfection as it will comme il faut.<br /><br />by Trevor Meyer
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Awesome special effects and very family friendly. Hard to get into at first but stick with it, I doubt you will be disappointed.
1608871517|5.0|To start this off, What can I honestly say about this book??<br />It literally took my breath away, the moment I received it, which was a bit sooner than I ever anticipated. As soon as I got it, I immediately started checking out the pages first, before even reading it, & WOW! WOW! WOW! That's a triple WOW right there. LOL :) The photographs were absolutely STUNNING! I especially loved the very front cover of the book, since it has Michael's ICONIC BAD Tour jacket, which happens to be one of my absolute faves!! I couldn't take my eyes off the amazing close ups/details of Michael's beautiful clothing/jackets, etc.<br />I do have to admit, there were some great parts in the book as well.<br />Hate to spoil it for everyone, but there was a section in the book that had me laughing like crazy, to which it was the part where Michael Jackson explained about why he wanted to rip his shirts once in a while, or cut it just a little bit, & the term he came up with was \\"cake\\" since he mentioned about his female fans wanting to \\"see some cake\\"(meaning his chest) & oh he was right about that one.<br />The next thing that I really liked in the book was when they talked about the four F's when it came to Michael's outfits! They are \\"FIT\\" \\"FUNCTION, \\"FUN\\" & \\"FIRST.\\" I thought that was pretty neat & should also be pretty easy to remember when it comes to Michael's outfits!<br />Another part of the book that I really enjoyed was where they talked about the outfit for Michael's short film \\"Remember The Time\\" in which it was all Egyptian themed! As a youngster, I was  always intrigued about Egypt & would watch things about it all from time to time. I still do once in a while, but not quite as much as I did back when I was young! Anyways, back to the subject! In regards to the \\"Remember The Time\\" short film, I was surprised that Yul Brynner was mentioned & the fact that Michael was inspired by a piece he wore for the amazing film \\"The Ten Commandments\\" which was called a \\"gorgerine.\\" Pretty amazing if you ask me.<br />But anyways, enough about what my fave parts were in the entire book!<br />For me, it took only a few days to finish the book! I never thought it would be THAT good. I truly believe in my heart of hearts, that Michael Bush was a TRUE friend to Michael & cared about him very much. I truly feel that he wanted to do the absolute best for Michael, since he's truly a perfectionist & wanted everything to be perfect the way he wanted it. I also feel that he wanted to get the book done for all the fans, since that's what Michael Jackson originally wanted as well.<br />So, to those fans who don't have this book, You MUST get this it! It's truly a wonderful read & you will not be able to put it down! It's THAT amazing. I will continue to cherish it for years to come! This book is truly one of the best books about Michael, AT IT'S ABSOLUTE FINEST!!<br />THANK YOU SO MUCH MICHAEL BUSH FOR THIS WONDERFUL TREASURE/MASTERPIECE!!tty amazing if you ask me.<br />But anyways, enough about what my fave parts were in the entire book!<br />For me, it took only a few days to finish the book! I never thought it would be THAT good. I truly believe in my heart of hearts, that Michael Bush was a TRUE friend to Michael & cared about him very much.

B004FGMDOQ|2.0|This started off really well actually. But I could not get past disc 4 of the audiobook. I started to find myself pressing fast forward to skip parts, then just gave up and returned it to the library. I read a summary of the end of the book and am very glad I decided not to continue. I was hoping that it would be a creepy ghost story, instead it is a lot like the X-Men academy combined with time travel.  The main character comes across as dimwitted, and most of his internal dialog is asking himself questions that is supposed to lead to mysterious exposition, but most of the time the reader has figured out what is going on long before, leaving you waiting in frustration for main character to catch up and continue the story. I'm not a fan of this style of exposition where the character's thoughts are things like-\\"Wow, the weather here sure does change fast!\\" And \\"Hmmm I wonder how I missed all of these footprints on the path earlier. I'm sure that means absolutely nothing.\\"  I exaggerate, but you really are left with the feeling that the story is being told through the point of view of someone who is annoyingly slow.<br /><br />It's a shame, it started off so well, and I really enjoyed the creepy feel of a ghost story. About half way through I am starting to lose patience with it though. I find it incredibly bizarre that the author chose a new passion for ornithology as Jacob's dad's excuse for them taking that trip. It seems like she could have come up with just about anything else. Maybe Jacob is 18 and tells his parents he is going to backpack around Europe with friends or something. Maybe his dad is an anthropologist and wants to interview isolated island people. Maybe he just likes British beer. There's a scene after Jacob and his dad arrive on the island, where they go for a hike and stumble upon the nesting grounds of some sort of supposedly rare seagull. Jacob's dad immediately becomes entranced and wants to spend hours staring at them, conveniently leaving his mentally unstable son free to wander around by himself. Really? Doesn't it seem weird that he suddenly develops an overwhelming passion for birds?<br /><br />I was listening to the audiobook, which is also part of the problem. The narrator speaks too slowly and overly enunciates. He is also very bad at accents, it is quite distracting when he attempts to do Welsh and other British accents.
B005GPFDQK|5.0|Imagine going to a party and seeing all your lifelong friends there in one place at one time.<br /><br />\\"All You Need Is Now\\" will forever be known as Duran Duran's second best album. There is no way they will be able to top this album again. I place it at the top of the Duran pantheon, between \\"Rio\\" and \\"Astronaut\\".  \\"Rio\\" has 9 songs. \\"All You Need Is Now\\" has between 14 and 18 songs, depending on which version you have. If need be, it can easily be trimmed down to 9 songs that are almost as good as \\"Rio\\". My 9 are:<br /><br />1. All You Need Is Now<br />2. Blame The Machines<br />3. Being Followed<br />4. Girl Panic<br />5. Too Bad You're So Beautiful<br />6. Runway Runaway<br />7. Mediterranea<br />8. The Man Who Stole A Leopard<br />9. Before The Rain<br /><br />\\"Go directly to the voodoo\\"<br />The weird keyboard warble of the title track shows that this is not a retro record. Though the chorus shows that it is pure Duran.<br /><br />\\"You are not required to think at all\\"<br />`Blame The Machines' takes us roaring up the autobahn with a sexy GPS, subliminally telling us that the girls are in control. A pure Duran Duran rocker.<br /><br />\\"To the voyeur seated in the darkened room\\"<br />`Being Followed' is Stalin's daughters' paranoia being buttressed by Andy Taylor's guitar licks, which are being supplied admirably by Dominic Brown, who helped write most of the songs. Have I mentioned that this is pure Duran?<br /><br />\\"She's got me atomized\\"<br />`Girl Panic' has the boys are cranking now. This album just sounds so good, a nice quality recording. In case you missed it, this is pure Duran.<br /><br />\\"So instant fabious\\"<br />`Too Bad You're So Beautiful' .This time Le Bon is not good enough for the girl, as she is on top of the world and he has nothing to give her, material wise at least. Not the kind of girl a romantic should be hanging with.<br /><br />\\"Chilly in the morning sun\\"<br />`Runway Runaway' is Rhodes fascination with the world of glamour. No joining the circus here, she's off to be a super model.<br /><br />\\"Nine a.m. the beach, tequila mayhem\\"<br />Outside of `Save A Prayer', `Mediterranea' must be the most gorgeous song Duran has ever done. Easily one of the few songs that really grasp the whole feeling of getting away on vacation. It is smooth sailing the whole way.<br /><br />\\"So elegant and sleek\\"<br />'The Man Who Stole A Leopard` is the consummate Duran Duran song. As great as anything they have ever written. It has all the class and style that Duran is known for, with a dash of mystery.<br /><br />\\"Words that are spoken to the wind\\"<br />`Before The Rain' is the moody album closer. This is a song written by older men who have weathered life. It just happens that these men are rich pop stars who have given us an album rich in music from a time of our youth.<br /><br />Of course the other songs are good too. The deluxe issues of `Networker Nation' and `Too Close To The Sun' flow good together, as do `Early Summer Nerves' and `This Lost Weekend'. All are worthy of being on the standard album.<br /><br />According to the band, this is supposed to be the album that came after \\"Rio\\". I for one do not see a disconnect between \\"Rio\\" and \\"Seven And The Ragged Tiger\\", but, amazingly, this new album seems to fit between the two. A camera reminiscent of `Girls On Film' can be heard, as well as drum beats from `Hold Back The Rain' and a synthesizer nod to `The Chauffeur'. The 80's nightclub discotheque pop and sizzle is all here, but it does not sound decadent, it sounds very modern. It sounds like a return to that pure Duran sound you used to know, that instantly recognizable power pop.<br /><br />This is a classy album. You now have your invitation, come join the party.<br /><br />~*~<br /><br />\\"Today a man was taken from his apartment at the New Jersey Shore, and arrested under suspicion of entrapment of a wild animal. Griesley Port Entry discovered a caged leopard in the building. The fully-grown feline was said to be surprisingly domesticated, by zoological experts, who gave her a thorough examination, before preparing her for relocation.<br /><br />A large crowd had gathered outside to watch the beautiful creature, as a giant cage was lowered slowly onto the street by a crane. From here, the leopard was transferred into the back of a truck for its journey ahead.<br /><br />A startled onlooker said, it's extraordinary to think that any human being could have lived in such close quarters with such a dangerous animal. Police are saying that the captive was simply besotted with the creature, and barely left her side. It's alleged that he hunted her in the wild and expertly forged documents to facilitate her illegal export to the United States of America. The incident has already created much controversy, and is now likely to lead to a major international investigation, into the life of the man who stole a leopard.\\"s said to be surprisingly domesticated, by zoological experts, who gave her a thorough examination, before preparing her for relocation.<br /><br />A large crowd had gathered outside to watch the beautiful creature, as a giant cage was lowered slowly onto the street by a crane.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm not in the best of shape but I wanted something that would motivate me.  This fits the bill.  I like that there are three different fitness levels on each exercise that is done.  You can follow which ever one fits your level.  She is tough.  I like that I can start over...even when I can only get 5 minutes through the first exercise!  I know there will be a day that I get through the whole series...not there yet...but I will be!
B00987MQRQ|5.0|Dr. Spencer Black was a good doctor. His colleagues all respect him. That is until Dr. Black started his own experiments. This book is about Dr. Black and his experiments all the way leading up to his disappearance. In this book are all the pictures of the creatures that Dr. Black was researching.<br /><br />This book is creepy but memorizing at the same time. It was like I was really reading the journal of a mad but brilliant man. I say brilliant because Dr. Black although he may have turned into a monster in the name of science he still was trying to further investigate and research all that science had to offer.<br /><br />When Dr. Black started creating his own blend of monsters in his lab and the results that was scary. However I was also intrigued by them as well. As you can tell I can not say enough great things about this book. This book needs to be turned into both a big screen movie and television series. Mr. Hudspeth holds nothing back with his first book. I anxiety await his next book. The Resurrectionist is a must read and probably one of the best books I have read in 2013! Don't walk but run to the bookstore or type as fast as you can online to pick up a copy of this book today.
B004YJMQCS|5.0|I love the FD series and it's fantastic to see this in Blue-ray 3-D!  FD5 is also outstanding in 3-D and I hope that the remaining films are released in that format.  The best health & safely films ever!
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|It was only natural that McClane would lose his mojo, especially since he has to go to Moscow and Chernobyl to blow things up.<br />Bruce Willis is always a fun action hero to watch, but this is really a boring movie. Yes, it has all the explosions, the car<br />car chases, the automatic weapons, and of course helicopters that McClane manages once more to bring down, but it still boring.<br />There is no real story and the fact that they go to Chernobyl for a shoot out is beyond even a sci fi movie.<br />Still, it is watchable if you do not expect to see the good old McClane. His son and sidekick is not a McClane for sure, and I<br />don't know if Jai Courtney will inherit the series, but when a series has gone to the fifth installment over 25 years there is<br />bound to be problems.<br />Again, just because I thought it was a little boring I am not saying it is not watchable!

1603425381|5.0|I love this book.  Since it arrived I have used it on several projects .  I have found that I can even use parts of different borders and generate something to fit my project.  I love how the book lays flat when I set it out to follow a design, and that almost all designs are complete on the right and left side pages, so that there is no turning of the pages while I am working.  I think this book will encourage me to be more creative, and to add some really nice borders to my work.  I am a fairly new crocheter( about 5 years), and I am trying to be more brave in following more difficult designs.  This book has everything from the very basic to the most difficult.  A good resource for any crocheter.  The best thing is that it is a nice size for toting along to my crochet group, or on a trip or just to a waiting room for an appointment.

0988178532|5.0|I'm not usually drawn to fantasy but I really enjoyed this book. It is well written, engaging and moves along to keep the reader engaged.<br />That rascal Brandt apparently has a trilogy in mind. I'll read it!
B00AG297GK|2.0|Sacha Baron Cohen has done great work in the past - Ali G, Borat, etc. - but in my mind the decline started with Bruno and this movie is the pits. He needs to go back to the semi-reality type of stuff he used to do...
B0010ZR160|5.0|I rented this movie from Netflix some time ago, and it's haunted me since I saw hit. Figured it was a good one to have in my personal collection. Tough, gritty, though-provoking. Highly recommend, though not for the squeamish.
B00BUT5I84|4.0|I was very excited when I found out that 30 seconds to Mars was coming out with some new music and I found \\"Up in the Air \\" to be a promising debut for their album but after hearing the album I find myself a bit disappointed. I was hoping they would come out with music that rendered those same feelings I felt when I listened to their previous albums. I was hoping to feel that energy and excitement that songs like \\" Closer to the Edge\\"  was built upon; Songs that grab a hold of you through the speakers. I am not saying that the albums lacks emotion. It seems to actually be oozing emotions such as the ones it is named after but its not a complete 30 Seconds to Mars album to me. It much mellower then their previous works and repetitive. I will still keep some of the songs on this cd in my track list because some are not bad and I look forward to their future endeavors.<br /><br />REVISED REVIEW:<br /><br />I get it now.<br />After hearing the album again I raise my rating. The album definetly has a diffrent feel to it. It is still 30 Seconds to Mars though. The music is not as up beat as prevous albums but it still holds those dark aspects that is present in a lot of 30STM works. Love Lust Faith + Dreams is suttle and entrancing, with surprise changes in tempo. After hearing the album more closely I appriciate how they experimented with the format to some of the songs and their use of diffrent sounds.
B005T87QCI|4.0|On the bright side there are new characters that are incredible but on the bad side you have to buy them.
B00009RDGA|5.0|I remember when this film came out.It was shot in black and white,which was highly unusual during the new decade of codachrome photgraphy(1970's).Of course,considering the time-frame for which the film represented,depression era hard times,the use of black and white gave the viewer a sense of 'stepping in' to the past.<br />  The movie itself is charming,with Ryan O'neal and his young daughter 'Tatum' in her film debut.
B001NA6096|4.0|Interesting to listen to the conversation that they have.  A compelling, captivating movie.  Will be watching Before Sunset and Before Midnight (when it comes out).
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|it was a slow start it started to get better as the story continued. loved the ending and i might pick up the book.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|An excellent movie, even more compelling than Before Sunrise.  I got caught up in the relationship, and I think it demonstrated what true love might look like.  I am looking forward to Before Midnight.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|Fun movie that is just what it says it is. Witch killing siblings killing witches. Hawkeye vs Dark Phoenix. Guess what? This movie is 10 times better than GI-Joe Retaliation and Fast and Furious 6.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|I was very disappointed when about 3/4 of the way through the movie, I began to wonder how they would possibly cover everything in the time remaining.  Then, I realized, wait a minute they are gonna stretch this out for 2 movies?  A little research and it is actually 3 movies?  Crap.  Why would the take a basic book and drag it out for 3 movies, besides just trying to make 3x the amount of money?  This could have been accomplished much better in one 3 hour movie.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Great tool. I don't use the higher functions at this point, but the app is the easiest to use calculator I've come across.
B006L1TX50|5.0|The fan is quiet and runs great.  I hardly know it's there.  I mounted it in my desk cabinet with an AC adapter (12 volt DC).<br />Reasons why this fan is awesome:<br /><br />Very high Life Expectancy (100,000 hours).<br />Most quiet fan I could find (13.83 dBA).<br />Uses only 1 watt of power.<br />Moves 35 CFM air (which is plenty for my computer desk).
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show and this season.  I have watched both season 1 and season 2 on Amazon Prime on my Roku device (that I purchased here) and I am simply in love with how this was made and written.  Awesome actors and set design as well.
B0083ZRAJS|1.0|I'm a little disappointed on how different this is from the movie....something I grew up watching....it was ok just different!
B001JU4S44|4.0|John Woo is an amazing director. His view of camera and angle exceeds any director out today. He can make any actor look good in a movie. Even Tom Cruise
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Rich characters, amazing history of W W II,  fantastic storytelling through letters, full of twists and turns and surprises---all add up to a wonderful read!
1400049628|5.0|This was a fun book.  I read it before Max Brooks' hit &#34;World War Z.&#34;  I've now read that as well, and have enjoyed his take on the zombie genre.

B006T5FDLG|5.0|I've been an avid fan of the band for over 20 years, and have enjoyed the growth and depth they obtain with each new album.  This was not a disappointment.
B00821OX98|5.0|Forget Independence Day and the frantic excitement of trying to fight off an alien invasion as it happens, and just accept that it has happened, for reasons you know not.  Now that you have accepted your fate, let's join the 22nd Mass as they attempt to survive in this &#34;brave new world.&#34;<br /><br />I consider the comparison between The Walking Dead and Falling Skies to be fair, based on the premise that both shows turn the world upside down, forcing a re-evaluation of what was once the norm but no longer fits, no matter how hard you try to push that square belief through the round hole of reality.  Watching survivors try to adapt to their new world while clumsily holding tight to the old norms, is brilliant.  Just brilliant.<br /><br />This show is, half alien invasion, half apocalyptic survival, and half &#34;why don't the things I believe in matter in the same ways they used to?&#34;  Three halves make a whole.  Don't get stuck on the math.  Seriously, it'll mess with your head.  Get stuck on the characters who make this show believable, pulling you along as they make all too human mistakes, some based on old belief structures, and some triggered as new beliefs are formulated on the fly.<br /><br />This show is clever, sincere, honest, compelling, and most importantly not over simplified or 'dumbed' down, in my opinion.  Unless I am already dumb, in which case this show would seem normal to me once reduced to my level.  In either case, they pull it off cleanly and succinctly.  My wife bounced in and out of the series as I blew through both seasons in a week, and made the following passing comment after watching a particularly tense episode, &#34;Well, how the &#60;bleep&#62; am I supposed to go to sleep after that?&#34;  And, she only considers herself &#34;geek-adjacent.&#34;  Although she did recently defend the new Star Trek movie and Wil Wheaton's social contributions in the same sentence from a nay-Sayer of both topics, so we might have to upgrade hergeek &#34;status.&#34;<br /><br />Watch the first three episodes, and judge for yourself.  Personally, I don't think you'll regret the brief investment of time.<br /><br />-Goodge
B008PZ69T8|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this album. I love all the music on here. It is so soothing. If you love classical music a great buy!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Thrilling turn pager action filled book. A must read.<br />Full of suspense and intrigue and great end to the book.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|If you are one of those who managed to slog your way through David Mitchell's slow moving and densely packed book, you'll likely enjoy the film version of Cloud Atlas for its significantly more brisk telling of the story.  If you haven't read the book, then you might want to skip this one.  You'll just be lost most of the way through.
B00338QENI|4.0|Hard to imagine this actually happened.  What an awesome spirit this family has.  A part of American history that we should not forget.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is an excellent writer. Her novels hold your attention and have a twist. I enjoyed Daddy's Gone A Hunting.

B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|When Alice In Chains reformed in 2005 many fans wondered if the band could continue as Alice In Chains without the late, great Layne Staley. Staley's one-of-a-kind, immediately recognizable, harrowing vocals, which intertwined beautifully with Jerry Cantrell's harmonies seemed so essential to the group's sound that it seemed impossible that the band could continue as Alice In Chains without him. Yet the band proved that they could indeed continue as Alice In Chains with their 2009 comeback album, the excellent \\"Black Gives Way to Blue.\\" Staley's replacement William DuVall, who joins AIC veterans Cantrell, Mike Inez (bass) and Sean Kinney (drums)  may not be as unique a singer as Staley, but he is an accomplished singer/songwriter in his own right, having released a few critically acclaimed albums with his band Comes With the Fall and he sounds enough like Staley that his vocal harmonizing with Cantrell really recaptures the classic sound of AIC's early albums.<br /><br />The post-Staley Alice In Chains is a most definitely a different animal than the original band. With classic Alice In Chains, Cantrell and Staley were arguably equally as important---Cantrell wrote a bulk of the music and Staley wrote a majority of the lyrics and sang the songs, and it was the amazing vocal harmonizing between the two that really gave AIC their sound---sort of like Black Sabbath meets the Beatles, dark sludgy riffs with beautiful, melodic harmonies. With Alice In Chains new album \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" as with \\"Black Gives Way to Blue,\\" the group's dynamics are a little different. DuVall, who provides lead vocals and plays guitar is obviously an important part of the band, but he doesn't stand out the way Staley did. Cantrell, on the other hand, who started to take a more prominent role singing since the \\"Jar of Flies\\" (1994) EP, now almost seems to be the co-singer/frontman of Alice In Chains. With a lot of AIC's songs from the last two albums, Cantrell and DuVall seem to sing in harmony throughout the track.  That's not said as a criticism, rather just as an observation. Jerry Cantrell is one of the most gifted singer-songwriters of his generation, is a fine singer and has released some amazing solo work. It's just that Alice In Chains 2.0 is arguably \\"Jerry Cantrell's Alice In Chains\\"--even though their last album and their new one are still very much group efforts.<br /><br />Quite simply, if you enjoyed Alice In Chains last album \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" you will probably like \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" too. Alice In Chains new album may sound a little sleeker, crisper and more polished than its predecessor, but it's more-or-less a continuation of where AIC left off with their last disc. The new album sounds like vintage Alice In Chains--gloomy, grinding riffs, killer guitar solos, depressing lyrics and amazing harmonies.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Hollow\\" and to be honest I didn't take to it right away. My initial reaction was that it sounded like a BGWTB B-side and was sort of by-the-numbers AIC. However, with repeated listens I really like the track; it's sort of an insidious grower. I liked \\"Pretty Done\\" right away and think it's somewhat remonstrant of \\"What the Hell Have I\\" from the \\"Last Action Hero\\" soundtrack (1993).  The sludgy \\"Stone,\\" like \\"Hallow\\" was a bit of a grower for me. The semi-acoustic \\"Voices\\" was an instant favorite of mine. It's somewhat reminiscent of \\"When the Sun Rose Again\\" from BGWTB and \\"No Excuses\\" from \\"Jar of Flies.\\" The album's title-track, \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" eerily grinds along before the chorus kicks in full-throttle and takes hold of you. My least favorite song on AIC's new disc is probably \\"Lab Monkey,\\" which isn't bad, but a little generic and not terribly interesting. \\"Low Ceiling,\\" although a rocker, is one of the more pop and polished songs that AIC have written and would be a good contender to use as a single. \\"Breath on a Window\\" took a few listens to fully appreciate. At first it seemed like a mere rehash of a superior song from BGWTB, but it has a good hook and I like it the more I listen to it. The excellent, semi-acoustic \\"Scalpel\\" sounds a bit like something off of Jerry Cantrell's \\"Boggy Depot\\" album. One of the album's highlights is definitely \\"Phantom Limb\\" which is destined to be an AIC classic. It has one of the best riffs that Cantrell has ever written and just plain kicks ass. \\"Hung on a Hook\\" is another downbeat slower song that took me a few listens to take to. The closing track \\"Choke\\" isn't an AIC classic like the way \\"Would?,\\" \\"Over Now\\" and \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" are,' but it's a solid rocker.<br /><br />AIC fans would be advised to pick this album up. \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" may not be a masterpiece like \\"Dirt\\" or \\"Jar of Flies,\\" but it's still a very, very good album and it only gets better the more you listen to it. This CD makes me feel very optimistic about the future of Alice In Chains.ppreciate.

B00821OX98|3.0|Known actor at the core, okay writing and decent acting from support crew.  The story line thesis deserves consideration. Why are familial bonds so important?  What does bind us together?  The invading aliens could be replaced by any number of other destructive forces, such as a natural disaster, which breaks down our society.  How do we respond?  How should we respond?  We have, in a few short generations, created a modern resource distribution system which can NOT be sustained. Current generations take it for granted, and are entirely dependent. Our existing organizational structure, of laws; justice and power, is much weaker than most realize.  A young person alive today may very well experience something similar to this breakdown.  Others have, within the last century (think Russia, 1917, etc.).<br />The sound effects and CG are a bit cheesy, by today's standards.  They would be considered movie quality,( in 1990).  I'm surprised they were able to get such a big name to anchor the series.<br />This series is better than many.  I'd place it in the upper 20%, for the genre.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this season was very exciting and interesting! I would definitely recommend others watching season 3 after seasons 1 and 2.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I've been using this app for about a week. I wasn't expecting a whole lot since I didn't do a test drive ahead of time so I was pleasantly surprised to find out you can mix and match your sounds, control individual sound volume, and use a timer.<br /><br />So far it has worked without a single issue on my galaxy S3...  The developer seems pretty responsive to any issues as well (there are several mentions of them addressing issues in the comments)<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because at this price point I would like to be able to add your own audio and setup a loop that way...<br /><br />But no real complaints here, happy with my purchase...<br /><br />I<br /><br />I
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love these types of games. This one had the right amount of searching and seeking. I didn't like how it would prompt you to use the wrist for certain things. I would have rather figured it out myself.
0061564893|1.0|You can either flip on the old T.V. and watch a televised evangelist fabricate a long list of how God is going to bless you if you give to their ministry -- or, you can buy Gavin Menzies book and read the ooze that he claims is historical research while he tries to lead you to believe he is blessing you with newfound knowledge. Pick your fantasy, they both will end up costing you money. Likewise, both will try to convince you they are the real deal through the sheer weight of their personality while purposefully ignoring any evidence to the contrary, so consider yourself warned. That being said, if you really enjoyed this book stand by for my book on how the Irish landed on the moon 500 years before the Americans, soon to be followed by how the Ancient Greeks stole the Iliad from the Aztecs -- thus the story of Jason and the Argonauts. Isn't it obvious?
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I like Pollan's mixture of history, storytelling and food description.  I can't wait to try the barbecue!  It offers practical cooking tips in an entertaining and informative format.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Does this release contain the spare digits, lyrics and 5.1 sound tester?<br />I haven't purchased yet. I found an edition on another site that listed some goodies and the format is the original 1.33:1. Including Gilmour and Jools Holland performing \\"I Put A Spell On You\\"
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Sloan doesn't take himself too seriously.  Characters are endearing and the what-if situation of Google vs. print makes this a worthy read.
B0083EY9EI|4.0|I bought this when it first came out because of the critical praise this was receiving.  It is one of my favorite releases from last year.  Much like when Adele's first CD came out I begged people to listen to it and told them how amazing it and she was.  No one listened.  :)  Now they're all huge fans since the 2nd CD.  I did the same with this and none of my friends listened again.  So, maybe it'll take another CD to get people to take notice.  She is going places.  Amazing talent.
B00BGIC170|4.0|Very funny. Will definitely watch it again. Purchased to watch on the plane and was not disappointed.  Had a few laugh out loud moments.
145210655X|5.0|If you're a Star Wars fan, or your kids are, then this is a good pick.  My kids don't really know the Star Wars story, so it's just a kids book to them, but I laughed a lot, and it REALLY brought back memories of not only Star Wars, but Calvin and Hobbes.  *sigh*
B004HO6I4W|5.0|We DVR'd this at home and our 2 year old watched it relentlessly. When we changed cable providers we lost our DVR'd version. So, onto to Amazon I went. I found this SO reasonably priced. It came wrapped in the original plastic and with all of the bells and whistles - DVD, Blue Ray and Digital copy! I will be back to this shop in the future!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Heartbreaking & Heartwarming at the same time. It makes you believe true love still exists! It also makes you believe friends come in all forms.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I was excited to see this.<br />Until I really saw it.<br />I liked the first two with Daniel Craig better.<br />This issue seemed to plod along.<br />Not boring - just plod.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The only problem with this series (at the time of this posting) is that I now have to wait for the final publishing of the third book in this trilogy.  Any time to wait is too long for this wonderfully engaging and original fantasy journey.
B0086700CM|4.0|so fun. I can't stop using it. this app is worth your time. although difficult at the first try, this game is easy to improve on, and with new people to onlock it never gets old. you unfortunately you can not play with people online. however for children this makes this game safer. so great! I love this game!
B000FC13Y0|5.0|As usual, Gaiman offers great fantasy reading. Engaging, approachable, classic tale in new clothes that was a joy to read.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Comfortable, can wear for extended periods without my ears hurting.  Being able to control the sound (when listening to music) from the buttons is quite nice.
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|Seen this before in different movies. OK acting but you should wait until free on Amazon or Netflix. Not worth the $5.99
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome. I love this game.Forget the other games. I would buy the game.It is worth it.So buy it.That's all I could say.

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Somewhat painful to watch if you are related to someone like any of the characters but that is an indication it is well done. The DeNiro character is the only one that really develops over the course of the movie and it isn't clear why the award was won. All in all a good watch, worth the price.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I don't know if its the cable or the plug in charger but kindle will not charge have to use phone charger
B009UAO1ZG|1.0|I was really interested in this book as I had never heard anything negative about Charles Lindburgh. The author was all over the place. Just when the book was flowing and interesting the writer would take a hard right detour and go on about a new character. Because of this, I had to give up on the book, I couldn't bear to suffer through it. Maybe it would make for a better documentary where the editor could ensure the information flows from one topic to another.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Peter is just about to turn 10 years old and is expecting to grow quite substantially with the addition of a second digit to his age. With his mother, he visits Mrs Kipple, the owner of the local antiques shop, on the promise of a surprise birthday gift. While wandering around amongst the clutter of old and unusual objects he discoverers a clock through which more than time can pass and a magical journey through a strange and fantastical world begins.<br /><br />William O'brien writing style, while quirky, keeps you hooked and truly brings his darkened fairy-tale world alive. His ability to describe the world through the eyes of a ten year old boy is quite remarkable and leaves you reminiscing about when our own thoughts were untarnished by the sensibilities of adulthood.<br /><br />Peter: A Darkened Fairy-tale is like a cross between Alice in Wonderland, The Wind in The Willows and anything by Tim Burton and reads like a ride down a helter-skelter. Filled with weird and wonderful locations and off-the-wall characters, your mind is left buzzing by this authors unique and unfettered imagination. With the fast paced action and the in depth descriptive passages, the story flows like the perfect roller-coaster; a smooth yet exhilarating experience.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I guess all the loose ends were tied up, but it left me feeling that there was more story left to tell. It was just honestly too predictable.
1476734941|5.0|I was a fan of Mosley's PBS series and hoped his book would be done in the same fashion.  The recipes are shown in color and the book goes over different styles (number of days) to fast.  The 'Live Longer' part is still being researched, but the diet can work if you work at it.
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|Many audiophiles will take eack track of this album apart, explaining the use of autotune, double tracking, and even accusing (with cause)the producers of using other , studio recordings to support weaknesses in the live performances; all of this may be true, but the question is this: \\"does it corrupt the experience of listening and enjoying the songs?\\"  And further, does all this \\"swetening\\" so pervert the original reality of the performances, creating a frankenstein monster of musical perportions, that it's not worth hearing.<br /><br />My answer is no.  To get the best sound however, play it loud on good equiptment and not just on computer speakers. And get the real CD, not the internet version on i-tunes or Rhapsody; those sound terrible compared to the physical CD.<br /><br />Getcha back is the best track on the CD for several reasons: the performance, arrangement and production of the song is just stellar. It's a much better song in this live incarnation than on the studio album. David Marks is the star of the show: his burning solos and fills, and his majestic performance of the song Pet Sounds\\" are amazing highlights.<br /><br />But there are some poorly produced and weakly performed songs: \\"The Little Girl I once Knew\\" is the big disaster, as it is dominated by the voice of Jeff F., who is not a BB but who often sings too loudly in performing parts that Brian had done on the original albums.<br /><br />The other failing of the album is that it's too tied to early performances and could not draw from some later miraculous performances.<br /><br />So if you can accept that this is not the Platonic ideal of a live BB album, pull the top down, hit PCH, and crank up the Beach Boys; it will be magic, I assure you.
B003MXD694|3.0|I enjoyed this movie with my kids. The innuendos are geared for adults. The kids liked the clay animation. My kids at 7 and 5 are too young to really understand this film.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|Would be perfect if it supported network game play against human players and also was configurable for how many human vs AI players.<br />The AI plays tough - very aggressive.  It would be nice to configure that as well.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I don't generally like sit-coms, but I adore this show. It's endearing - that's the best way to put it. I just love all the characters - they are all super strong. Great actors, great timing. I laugh till it hurts and then I just want to give them all a big hug. I love their vulnerability and sensitivity. I think that most everyone can find a little (or a lot) that they can relate to - even if you are nothing like these people - just in the crap that life throws at you that they deal with. This is one of my &#34;can't miss&#34; shows and that says a lot - I don't watch too much tv on a regular basis.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Got this for the Mrs. for Christmas and must say it was a great movie.  Really steps away from the tyrpical Disney.  Plus getting the Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital and Ultraviolet copies were a major plus.  Movie can be streamed anywhere now.

B008XKSW7M|5.0|This movie was cute and funny.  It pretty well covered all the bases as far as pregnant women go.  It exposed pre conceived ideas about what really happens when someone is expecting.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Filled with action and keeps your on the edge if your seat. This is a great new take on the whole trek that even people that passionately dislike the other trek movies or shows will love this one and open their eyes to a brave new world.
0143122843|5.0|I really liked this book. I am a historian and I like many crime novels but I really don't need the in-depth gory details of murders or the excessive steamy sex scenes that can crop up. What I got from this book was what seems to be a remarkably accurate view of the third reich. Now I am going to go back and start the series from the beginning. I am hooked!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|One of the apps that I'm on most. Finally Amazon! Ya'll finally are getting it. It's good to see you're bringing some of the best of Android to a Android based tablet.
B00CW665VI|5.0|OMG! I cannot tell you how much I loved this book! Tangled (The Tangled Series) is the story of Drew Evans and Kate Brooks, told entirely from Drew's point of view. The amazing part is the way Drew tells it. I felt like I was sitting in a bar, catching up with one of my best friends. He tells his side, complete with examples and back stories to explain certain parts.It's refreshing and brilliant!<br /><br />Meet Drew Evans. He's the whole package...hot, rich, smart, and successful. But when we meet him for the first time, he's not himself at all. He's got what he thinks must be the flu. It has to be, because Drew Evans would never be heartbroken.<br /><br />Drew then backs up and tells us his \\"before flu\\" story. The story of how he met, fell for, got and lost a girl named Kate Brooks. The way he tells this story had me laughing until I cried in parts and had my girlie parts squirming in others. It is brilliant, I tell you!<br /><br />Here's the short version (I can't possibly ruin it for you). Drew meets Kate. Drew wants Kate, but Kate is engaged. To her boyfriend of eleven years, who is also in a band. When Kate is hired to work alongside Drew at his father's firm, Drew feels it fate. He uses any means necessary to get the girl. But what happens when he catches her?<br /><br />This was the first book I've ever read told entirely from the male's perspective, and I loved it. I could not put it down. It was so well written that I totally forgot a woman actually wrote it. The phrases Drew uses and the language is all male. The way Drew talks about his friends and his family is exactly how a guy would talk. No mushy stuff...just straight on, honest, and often offensive. In other words, HILARIOUS!<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that makes you cry, it's not Tangled. It will, however, make you laugh out loud, pant, and roll your eyes in parts. Emma Chase is now on my short list of go-to authors when I want a totally engrossing, sexy, funny book. Think Tara Sivecand Alice Clayton.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the next book from Emma Chase. Although Tangled is a stand-alone, I have it on good authority that we will hear more from Drew, Kate and the rest of the gang. Music to my ears!<br /><br />Tangled (The Tangled Series) by Emma Chase is a 5+ Hooker book! Run, don't walk to the 1-click button!<br />Tray from The Book Hookers
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Multiple story lines did not clearly relate to each other. No continuity. Movie was a big disappointment, I expected better.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|So much depth and detail and imagination! Easy to get lost and engrossed in this world. There are times when it get confussing remembering all the character names (there are many) but you get used to it. Highly recomend it!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|This version is very different from the current one out in the theater now. I think the original is much better than the current one, although the current movie is good too. I am so glad to have the original film in my movie collection.
B003THHIEM|5.0|My brother's been nagging me to watch this show for years. I finally bit the bullet and I LOVE this show! Nathan Fillion of Firefly fame is hilarious, and the chemistry between him and the female lead, Stana Katic is electric, to use a cliched phrase. I'm watching on a 13 inch Mac, so the standard def is good enough for me, but a larger screen might benefit from the high def.
1557420580|4.0|I ordered this book for my sister, who is a huge Fitzgerald fan. I plan to read it someday when I have some free time. I hear it is a great book.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I have been looking for an RPG type space game for a long time and came across just one. It has all the elements of a good RPG and is also replayable. There are so many waways you can play and you won't play the same game twice.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is a great program that is entertaining and captivating. It is nice to not have the need to filter crude and inappropriate content. Great series to watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|To me this app is like a virtual world for people and its AWESOME 5 STAR IF NOT U SUCK
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is much betters than temple run has awesome graphics its funny how the characters do funny moves I love the surfboards and jetpacks people who do not have this app and is reading my review get this game if you don't you'll regret it.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|My wonderful girlfriend asked me to watch this movie... and so... being a HUGE John Cusack fan - I said Yes... and I am SOOO glad I did!!!  This movie CONSTANTLY kept me on the edge of my seat - always waiting for the next... ummm... \\"mishap\\" !!!<br />Excellent movie.  And a very, very good choice to watch with a girlfriend if you are still starry eyed, as I am!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is so fun! I absolutely love it! it is a great way to pass the time and it makes you think! the critters are adorable and make the cutest sounds! definitely worth the download, if only there were no ads
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|A lot of people claim that you need to use real money.  This is not the case for this game so far, and I've beaten all 50 single player levels.  Granted, I did have  to use some items that I collected in game to do so.  And I died a lot.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Challenging<br />-Multiplayer adds another depth to the game.<br />-Three free playable characters and many more allies than first game.<br /><br />CONS<br />-Glitches at times.  There were a few multiplayer defenses where I waited forever for enemies  to spawn, but never did.  I just let those go, but very irritating.<br />-Seems like any power level can attack your artifacts in multiplayer. A tier system would be more fair, so you don't have a power level 4000 attacking you at 2000.
0375869026|5.0|I listened to this book on CD with my two boys ages 12 and 9&1/2 during a long car drive (3&1/2 hours each way).  Both boys were absolutely entranced by the story and were anxious to turn it back on anytime I stopped it for a minute to talk.  My younger son said he felt like the drive took \\"just 10 minutes.\\"  This book offers so much to think about and great lessons on the importance of kindness and acceptance.  Wonderful, wonderful book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I never had a thing for consuming energy in games, but it is pretty tolerable in My Horse. The graphics are exceptional, also. In being the horse lover that I am, I found this game to be rather enjoyable and I love it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|its great I love it I go zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz then I go zzzzzzzzzzz its awesome I luv it hahaha zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz who dont love it?
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I expected the ending to be more.... well.... detailed. It all happened so fast with a smaller climax than I expected. The book as a whole was very good though. I'm excited to be able to see the movie now :)
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Not to take up much more time on a movie you can do with out.  You have seen several of the genre with better acting and story line.  I am not sure why they bothered to make this film.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Completely enthralled.  Unbelievably good.  I cannot wait for Season 2 to be released on DVD.  This may be one of the best television series ever.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Bought for treadmill use as earbuds kept falling out....working so far, but tend to get some static on a regular basis.<br />Overall, very good value and product.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Be enjoyable. You will love playing it.  Give it a try.  Very addictive.  Once you play you won't want to stop.
1564148793|5.0|I have started putting much of this into practice and have already felt the change in my home and my personal protection. Very powerful. Only for those with experience.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This is a familiar theme.  I liked the pace, and the way the story unfolded.  It felt read and not over emotional.  My family had not seen this, and they really liked it.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I am usually disappointed when I take a chance on new music.  This recording is an exception.  I LOVE the cut, &#34;Radioactive&#34;.  I do think many of the other tracks have a similar sound but there are also differences that will catch the ear and draw you in.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|This movie is highly under rated on Amazon. It has an allstar cast, great story line and is very funny.  It's a movie the whole family can watch and the social situations are very realistic.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, as I do enjoy all the Disney animated films.  For some reason, however, the characters did not resonate with me the way they usually do.  I have watched it several times with my daughter and I do enjoy it, but I would recommend others first.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I loved it in theaters, and I love it at home! It is definitely not one for the kids. When I purchased Django Unchained, it was only available on Amazon instant video, but its such a good movie I just couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.
0689853637|5.0|This book is simply amazing!  It is a pop-up book, and if your children tend to rip the pages it may be something you will not want to keep in easy reach.  The pages are so intricately designed, and beautiful, you will spend many moments just looking at all the detail and wondering how it is done.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I tried and tried to get into this movie but I just couldn't do it. After 3 attempts at finishing it I always found myself getting sidetracked, stopping the movie or just finding something else to do and leaving the rest of the family to watch it. I miss the good old James Bond
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Let me start off by stating that I do not like Tom Cruise as a rule.  I think he is a fine actor, but I do not like him as a person.  I really wanted to hate him in this movie.  I pre-order all Lee Child books and I am a HUGE fan of the Jack Reacher series.  I wanted to think he ruined the character of Jack Reacher.  However, I actually enjoyed the movie.  Yes, I can name at least two other actors I would have preferred to see play that role, and I really didn't connect Tom Cruise with Reacher, but the movie was enjoyable to watch.  I am a single mother with a full time job, two teenage girls, one disabled daughter, and a whole household to maintain.  When I have time to sit down and watch a movie I want to be entertained and I don't want to waste unnecessary energy nitpicking every little detail.  The fight scenes were well done.  Sit back and enjoy.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|THIS SERIES IS A MUST READ! If you are looking for an emotional read, search no further! The Slammed series is one of the best!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The only negative thing I would comment on is that Hulk is not the same actor as in the first Hulk movie.  Other than that, this was completely entertaining and well written.  I had never considered how the egos of superheroes might interact (or not interact) and prevent them from being able to work together, but this film really nailed it.
1597772992|5.0|The first 6 or 7 pages are a bit scary. I have thumbed through it and look forward to reading it cover to cover. My husband loves steak and cheese. It will be a hard adjustment done slowly over time but its nothing compared to the alternative.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I rarely write reviews and in this case a lot has already been said. I'll just add that it's one of the best (if not THE best) fantasy I've read these last couple years. The author gets a lot of stuff right and the book is very entertaining. A lot of people compare it the Name of the Wind from P. Rothfuss. But... it's better. You immediately get drawn in the story. If you have any love for fantasy, you need to read Blood Song.
B008602KQI|3.0|surface-level grazing of the societal impacts of the districts, as well as a decent set of actors and storyline.  Entertaining.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I  wasnt a  big  fan  of  the  story  line, I  read  the  book  after  seeing  the  movie  trailer  then  decided  to  watch  the  movie  to  see  if  it  was  better  than  the  book.  It  was not.  The  movie  is  completely  different  than  the  book,  only  the  characters  are  the  same,  and a  lot  of  the  characters  are  missing  in  the  movie. I  say  do  one  or  the  other,  read  the  book  or  just  watch  the  movie,  otherwise  you  will  be  very  disappointed. I  don't  think I  will  read  the  rest  of  the  series.
B00CWV8X04|3.0|I guess that was to be expected from a Soderbergh, but it was a little slow at the beginning.  The acting was actually really good, and Mara was amazing.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Does the job and the price was right. Quick and easy download. Sometimes you don't need allot of words to say what is needed.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|This app sucks, do not waste your money! It doesn't do anything new.  I was disappointed and it doesn't unlock a front camera.
B0067AC5KA|3.0|Having never seen the movie, I got bogged down with the 15 letter names of streets and villages that I never even heard of.  The characters were good and the plot was terrific.  It was  drudgery for me sifting through to try to keep up.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great book!!! I would read it over and over again. It was a great read of love, tragedy, and struggle in life.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Even though I had read plenty of reviews raving about this book, I was unprepared for how engrossing it would be. I stayed up late two nights in a row because I just could not put it down. Great characters, a fascinating storyline, excellent writing...just awesome. I can hardly wait to continue the saga.
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|I think that it was a change of scenery,  if you will. Looking at Witch hunters versus the usual Vampire and Zombie killing movies. Good movie, Looks like they set it up for a sequel, which I would not mind checking out.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Haven't noticed any reduced battery life as other users have reported. Makes it much easier to see how much battery I have left and shows you how long you have for different types of usage. I play games and read on my kindle so it's useful to know if I should stick to reading or if I have enough battery to play games on a journey.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so fun. I don't spend money on it bc its so fun trying to breed the dragons to get what you want. Definitely use the guide to help you.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|As with the other books in this series, well written, immersive environment, only one complaint: waiting for the next one is a killer. I have already read the entire series through twic and expect to have read it a few more times before book 6 hits the shelf.
B009O2XY12|2.0|Bubble Mania reminds of a pc game I used to play called Dynomite, though the graphics aren't as fun.<br /><br />I only played this game for about a half hour before I uninstalled it.  It was fun to play, but it kept stopping in the middle of games, beginning at level 1 again.  If the game was over for some reason (out of time, etc), then it should have displayed &#34;game over&#34; with an option to play again.  I don't think the game was actually over, though, given that I played it enough times to monitor how much &#34;ammunition&#34; I had left in a given round and the game was just randomly rebooting itself.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|As with the other books in this series, well written, immersive environment, only one complaint: waiting for the next one is a killer. I have already read the entire series through twic and expect to have read it a few more times before book 6 hits the shelf.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|It starts off slow, but by episode 10, it becomes a must watch. The acting, the fight scenes, the darkness are all much much better than expected. I can't wait for the next season.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The depth of the book series over the HBO series is amazing. I found the book via the show but now the show is so weak in comparison i have almost stopped watching it......almost
B008C20TDG|5.0|Interesting concept for eating. Easy book to read and doing the Kindle method, not only less expensive but arrived immediately.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|As with the other books in this series, well written, immersive environment, only one complaint: waiting for the next one is a killer. I have already read the entire series through twic and expect to have read it a few more times before book 6 hits the shelf.
1609611543|3.0|sure .. you'll lose weight.<br /><br />I think that's the problem with this book and other books that promise weight loss with the elimination of an entire food group.  I know that some people may not be tolerant of wheat products (not celiac disease, just an intolerance to wheat or grains in general) and so when people give up wheat, sure they may feel better.  Perhaps wheat is causing their chronic inflammation.  However, for the rest of us, I think wheat is perfectly healthy.<br /><br />I eat wheat products, but not at every meal.  I may have an egg white omelet with veggies for breakfast, a turkey sandwich on a wheat sandwich thin for lunch and a protein/vegetable for dinner, which I feel is a reasonable consumption of wheat.  People who eat more than that such as cereal for breakfast, a 12 inch deli sandwich for lunch, bread with dinner etc .. sure you may feel sluggish and start packing on the pounds and anyone eating that many carbs would start to gain weight.<br /><br />I've read everything from vegan to paleo and I just think you should eat what you like that is healthy and in moderation.<br /><br />To your health,<br />Monica.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|As with the other books in this series, well written, immersive environment, only one complaint: waiting for the next one is a killer. I have already read the entire series through twic and expect to have read it a few more times before book 6 hits the shelf.
B00A6CT012|5.0|Pure and simple genius! I love the examples and recipes. I have been slowly moving to a more sustainable life, but this helped kick our home into high gear. Even my wardrobe is dwindling. That is saying a ton, I have no fashion sense at all, and need every color of the rainbow in my closet.<br />I love your vision of the future, and that section of the book should be shared with every living soul on this planet. Especially the nay Sayers. It is precise, simple, and oh so obvious!<br />Thank you so much.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Suspense was great. Recommend reading wikipedia to understand controversy surrounding inaccuracies in the movie. Made for a great movie though.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Nice graphics and good storylines. A good length of story too so you don't zoom through too quick. Can't beat the price either!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I like this game the kids get to harvest money and seaweek I think, the only thing we cannot figure out how to get pearls? but it is really good.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|wore out the vinyl record.  It got our babysitter's seal of approval.<br />Amazing number of really good songs on one album.
B00168HARG|5.0|It is not perfect, but it's a good entry into the Terminator Mythology. I think if you are a fan of the movies, you will enjoy the show.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|Very good,what they went threw.  It was a wonder any body close to the beach made it.  The hospitals were very helpful there.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Specially for those trips you know you might get without WiFi Internet connection for a long period of time on your kindle, you just browse anything you want on youtube and download it to watch on those occasions. I love it.
B004OA6KIS|4.0|I haven't gone back to this one as often as I hoped. It's got great stories and experiences in it, but it's still not as enthralling as the predecessor.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It does work even when I do not have WiFi internet connection on my kindle Fire, so it is ok.
0374275637|3.0|There is nothing in this book that Kahneman has not written about before.  The nonsense of System 1 and System 2 is silly and deflects from understanding.  Still, there are enough surprises to make this book modestly interesting.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe is best. Very good, you can open any PDF files I use it to save the NJ transit bus routes PDF Schedules.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Thai book is both amazing, interesting, and well rounded book that I think fans of hunger games would enjoy! Definitely recommended to everyone !
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is extraordinary. It works as a devotional, it will deliver a huge variety of devotional themes. It send reminders throughout the day when you miss a reading. There are so many different versions of the Bible and different language translations too, it is just Marvelous. And There are some versions that you can download to your Kindle and read it even without an internet connection. And every time they update it, it gets better and better! Now you can watch videos... it is just amazing, and you can read and listen to some of the versions! I love it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|luv luv luv luv luv luv it. it is awesome. rocks like mustaches rock. Hee-Hee. wow. my brother let me play it on his ipod. it was like whoa.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|We loved it.  It was great to see it in the comfort of our media room instead of in a theater.  Amazon rocks!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Beautiful and often poetic prose in a strong clear voice. Lovingly crafted world with a deep history. Intriguing characters. Definitely worth checking out.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Top notch vocals and harmonies, creative lyrics, musical riffs, and innovative artistry mark Fun.'s work. It's been a long time since I have listened to an album from end to end and loved every song. This one is constantly on repeat.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|my kids saw a play and found out about movie. So I ordered it and now it has become an everyday adventure
B00499NHLC|4.0|Good show streamed with excellent quality.  I will continually watch episodes of this show.  I am very pleased with this product.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|In the middle of NOWHERE in South Texas, this app let us know about incoming bad weather. Radar worked great and all maps were right on the money. Rare when we had this information where we were.<br />Would recommend to anyone........
B0094MFITS|5.0|I really enjoyed this as I missed it being on TV.  I plan to watch the rest of them.  I always did like Tom Selleck.
0670024813|5.0|Professor Jared Diamond's latest book contrasts life in traditional societies with that in modern, developed ones. Given the large number of such societies and issues he focuses on 39 traditional ones, particularly those with which he is personally familiar, and nine topics.  I found several of these topics--war, child rearing and religion--to be particularly interesting, but others may find different interests. Some of the book is highly personal accounts of Diamond's own experiences, especially in Papua New Guinea.  In many cases Diamond concludes that the way things are done in traditional societies is better than in the more developed state societies. For example in such societies children are carried and held facing in the same direction as the adult, whereas in western countries they are wheeled in strollers lying on their backs facing in the opposite direction.  He also notes that in some traditional societies, especially hunter-gatherers, children are not hit whereas they are in many western cultures.<br /><br />The book does give the reader a good appreciation of the differences between such societies and modern ones and gives one pause to reflect on whether or not some of our modern practices are really beneficial.  This is a book that will help you to think about life and the values you have and in that sense it is truly a five star book,
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game gives you many options.  I love playing the different forms.  Once you start playing, you can not stop.  This game is very addictive.  I like that it tells you how many matches you have left, and that you can shuffle the remaining tiles.  Well worth it.
B007MDB71O|3.0|I know that a mediocre version of Burrough's A Princess of Mars (with that title) existed already, but that should not have prevented the same title beging used instead of &#34;John Carter&#34; whose plot showed only small portions of Burrough's fertile imagination.
B0086449YA|4.0|Mark Knopfler hasn't quite matched &#34;Sailing to Philadelphia,&#34; but his albums always have interesting songs and beautiful guitar.  &#34;Privateering&#34; is one of the best.  Kim Wilson's work on harp gives several numbers a bluesy feel.  And &#34;Bluebird&#34; with its folk-blues evocative lyrics and haunting guitar solo is worth the price of admission.  I'd say: 5 stars if you are a big Knopfler fan; 4 stars for everyone else.  Don't know why this is not available as an MP3 or a domestic cd.  Odd.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the original minecraft and pocket edition they are so good this one is way cheaper then the Pc one but it's like what it says for the title. I recommend buying the Pc edition for 26.99 cause you can play multiplayer and more.
B0000046KM|5.0|Sublime music making. Mandel charts, Shirley's singing, great musicians. This is a classic album adored by musicians and fans alike.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Even those of us who think we know what we're doing may need this book. Yes! It directs your steps and sure helps figure out and fix what causes the errors when your work is presented for sale.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|I was scepticle at first, but high rating reviews convinced me to give this product a spin. And I was not disappointed. The components are high quality and the construction is solid and masculine.<br />But the style and appearance are stunning and bold.<br />For the price, it's a great value.<br />You won't be disappointed.<br />I've already ordered a second one...#1514...White face.<br />Thx.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Overall I liked it, it was a good update to the franchise, still not sure about the rewriting to history though.
B00CIHWTHU|3.0|I just bought 'The Avengers' a huge blockbuster movie recent movie for twenty bucks.  But they want almost sixty bucks for a low-budget sixty year old movie?<br /><br />Re-freaking-diculous.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a great story of a young boy making hard decisions and living with it afterwards.<br /><br />I bought this book a while ago but waited to read it. I anticipated that it would touch my heart and scar my soul; it has.<br /><br />I'm going to read the other books in the series because I have to know more.
B00007BKVC|5.0|Yup, great flick. Most women I know were like both Thelma and Louise at some point in their lives and it was fun for me to recognize that this time around. This version has an alternate ending, which I was happy to view, but I like the original best and for the same reasons that the writer and director commented on. It's eminently rewatchable for me.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So taken with the series I bought it for a friends birthday gift.  Can hardly wait for season 4 to arrive.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I sailed through this story. It seems pretty far fetched to go from Carrie Underwood's \\"Last Name\\" to happily ever after but otherwise not a bad little story. I enjoyed this story even if I never bought into the reality of it.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|I had been looking for an electronic notebook for work - tired of note pads.  I was excited to find this app and after reading the reviews thought I had found something that would work.  Unfortunately, I was only able to use it a couple of times and then it crashed. Every time I tried to use it I would get a message saying &quot;it has stopped&quot;. What does that mean? I shut down, re booted and nothing.  Almost $4.00 for nothing -  no rhyme or reason as to why - just nothing. VERY DISAPPOINTED and a waste of money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome game becuz u cans play more than one game...!! I love how we have to earn points yo buy another game...!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Only rarely are you fortunate enough to find a book that touches your emotions, tells a great story, and is exquisitely written. And The Mountains Echoed is all three of these and more. Khaled Hosseini has the remarkable ability to find the humanity in each of his characters so that you can see something of yourself in many of them, and feel for all of them. Although I am not usually a fan of novels that are a series of short stories, in this case it works beautifully. Each character's story is compelling on its own, but also an integral part of the larger tale. As I reflected on my one disappointment that an element of the story did not turn out the way I had hoped, I realized that as in life, everything is not tied up into neat little bows. Sometimes we have to embrace the happiness that we can. This is a book that you won't want to put down, but you should, because once you finish it you will be wishing for more.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|this is probably my favorite movie, lots if twists and being a father the right kind of Justice. Acting and action were blended perfectly.
B00CHI5F5S|2.0|Have you ever seen a Movie that looks Good and has those faces that draws you in?  Like a Good Gangsta Flick?  Not it.<br /><br />Weak Story with a good cast= a movie we don't like.  Here is the deal;  if you can't fall in love with the cast or &#34;get into the story&#34; then why do I care what happens?  That's it.  I don't.  The action means nothing.  You can even see the shortcuts and blunders in the story. You will scream out &#34;Yea right!&#34; or &#34;BS!&#34;.  The story is silly and cheap.<br /><br />Save you Dollars, defeat the temptation (I wish I had) and watch it for FREE! You will not regret you waited!
B0036G8IQS|4.0|I would recommend this book because not only is it entertaining, it teaches Greek gods and old story telling. Very compelling.
1423165691|5.0|no, there is no text to this book. But it's a very beautiful book filled with sketches from all the Disney movies up until Tangled. Drawn in what looks like charcoal, it looks like you can't touch the pages because it'll smudge. I highly recommend this book to any collector, definitely anyone who loves Disney. My only problem with this book is I would have liked to know who the sketches came from.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Great game. It's a little hard though when driving. Other wise it's g r eat a little progress also and they curse way too much but I can listen to it because I'm 24 so it's really good! But I got it at a price cut so bargain!!!!!!!!!
B008220C56|3.0|Definitely a little different. Movie jumped around a bit. Costumes were great. Acting was so,so. Not my cup of tea.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|On the game temple run two it's much better than temple run 1 .in temple run 2 it is more adventurous and more stuff added it has different characters and coins and diamonds if you want to re do  and play it again you should get the game
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A holiday tradition. Don't want to be without this! Everyone loves it! One of the funniest movies ever. Everyone needs this movie!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|An absolutely brilliant movie I would recommend it to anyone great to see a western can still be made properly. Thanks again
B0085RZFM8|5.0|** spoiler alert ** I loved it, and appreciate it now that I've finished it more than I did while reading. During the last hundred or so pages, I felt pretty tense, doing my best to remain unattached from Anthony and Gloria's downward spiraling state of emotions and affairs. Though I felt nothing near sympathy for them (how could anyone?), their story made me anxious, wanting to kick Anthony in the ass and tell him to pull himself together. The fact that Fitzgerald could draw me in so closely to his characters, of another era and having nothing in common with me whatsoever, is, above all, what draws me to his writing. This was the last of his five novels for me and I'm not sure yet exactly where I'd rank it, but I can declare that I enjoyed it more than Tender is the Night, and now it seems to me that he borrowed heavily from The Beautiful and Damned for the story and characters in Tender, particularly in how the featured couples in both books see their marriages come undone, the male protagonist finally left bitter and washed up.
B000VOC90Y|3.0|I like it , it is big and enough for alot stuff.there is more room for everything small or big.
0307949486|5.0|Like most people who've recommended this book to me, I couldn't put it down. Larsson creates a vivid world filled with many compelling questions and then answers them all by the book's end. In Blomkvist and Salander, the two protagonists, the author develops consistent, strong characters for whom I would imagine any reader will cheer in their quest to solve an old mystery and get the bad guys. My only complaint would be Blomkvist's overly simplified view of equity markets in general, but it's not enough to prevent me from giving this one five stars. I'll surely read Larsson's other books.
0066620996|5.0|This book is amazing.  Such simple ideas but backed up with great research.  I would recommend to anyone who is looking to better their organization and even themselves.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This movie was disappointing and really not very funny.  It felt like a very long and drug out movie.  Some parts make this worth renting but wait until the rental price lowers.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I hated this movie, I found it so boring. I thought, about 30 minutes in,  I will never be able to make it through.  So I certainly understand all the negative reviews here.<br />And then, I do not remember when, I realized that I was still watching. And all of a sudden the magnificent musical score drew me in more and more. Actually, I never quite knew what I was watching, And, personally,  I did not care. I have never had an experience quite like it.  I stopped figuring it out. My mind and heart opened. And by the end of the film, I was so deeply moved, I was shocked. I had tears running down my cheeks.  What a breathtaking piece of filmmaking.  It was beyond worthwhile to me that I chose to keep watching it.  One of the most profoundly moving films I have ever seen
B007FLHW3K|4.0|Got these for Xmas. They were toast by April. The wire snapped that connected the battery housing to the actual component. I like these lights, but there needs to be a better way to secure the battery pack to the wheel hub. Mine slid around so much that it put too much tension on the wire. This co. has an even funkier lighting system coming out in December that is being pushed on kickstarter. It looks really good.<br /><br />Edit!<br />After closer inspection, my light is still fully functional. While the wire did snap, it snapped at a point where it could still be utilized by the backup wire attached to the battery pack. I take back what I said about the light not being able to handle the streets of NYC. I will do a better job attaching the light to prevent future mishaps.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Just ok! Disappointed in casting...should have been someone like the Rock! Read all the Reacher books and have a hard time with Cruise in the role.

B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I was hoping this would be a great light comedy but the story line gets relatively serious and most of the funny parts are included in the trailer.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Of course Book is WAY better than the movie, and very different. Please read before you go see the movie.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a good read.  Once you start, you won't want to put it down and it reads very fast.

B00BYKIKJS|5.0|So, I fell asleep watching some of this, it wasnt the movie that bored me, it was the partying from the night before. I went back and watched it again with my GF two more times.......funny movie, great acting, good storyline that is easily understood if you have friends of the opposite sex........watch it.........its so good.
B00821PCJS|5.0|One of the best made for TV Sci-Fi series to come along in years.  Big budget, great casting, outstanding storyline.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this series.  Look forward to more.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am so happy to be able to watch this marvelous period drama!  It is so difficult to find anywhere to watch past episodes.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|First off - I liked the movie and I enjoyed it.  It is like an old pair of shoes - well broken in and no surprises.  Here we find all of our old friends in new bodies - Jim Kirk, Spock, Sulu, Scotty, and all the rest.  The casting was excellent because each new actor seems to have been chosen for the resemblance to the original.  Leonard Nimoy was great as Spock but the new Spock is ever bit as good and in many ways better - but that could have been the script.  After all it takes a great actor to portray a person who essentially has no emotion, but the new Spock, like the old one - manages to act through silence, a raised eyebrow, or inflection - great job by a young man.<br /><br />Of course this is a formula piece so it follows the formula and there is no surprises plot wise.  I saw this in 3D but I don't think it added anything to the film and may in some cases have detracted from it.  The set designs are good and the battle scenes drawn out for very little purpose but well done.  The sound track was bad and seemed out of place.  To the dedicated science fiction fan the film subtly pays homage to Star Wars, previous Star Trek episodes, and 2001 Space Odyssey.  Still this was a fun film and I enjoyed it.  Having said that there were a couple of things that drove me to give it 3 stars rather than 4 - nit picky things I admit.  First the script writers don't seem to be familiar with military courtesies and it annoyed me.  Kirk is outside uncovered while all the others are covered (wearing their hats), then when Spock is formally dismissed he just walks off, rather than doing an about face and marching out, and of course there were no salutes - annoying.  Then McCoy and the babe are out on a Planetoid that has a blue sky and apparently an oxygen atmosphere without any sort of protective suit. Not realistic.  Then when the artificial gravity switches on/off the people are floating but some of the debris appears to be falling - can't have it both ways.  Then the crash of the space ship at the end seemed out of proportion - yes the Enterprise is a huge ship but NOT that HUGE.  Still this is a fun film - not an academy award film - but predictable and fun.of the space ship at the end seemed out of proportion - yes the Enterprise is a huge ship but NOT that HUGE.

0385751532|5.0|Sad story.  Good read. It was meant for youth but still something we all need to see.  This is one of many but a good movie none the less.
B000YHG72E|5.0|If you want a funny wonderful Christmas movie - BUY THIS!<br />If you haven't seen this, what a shame - but it's never too late!<br />You will love it. It makes you smile and want to watch it over and over.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is an amazing movie.  I had previously purchased it for a  teen girls Group Home.  They were skeptical about watching it at first.  Then when the watched it, they loved it. Wanted to watch it over and over again.  Good positive story how they can overcome.  Also excellent for girls to see that they too can do whatever any boy can do if they really want to.
B008N1V11U|5.0|its the best bat man game for kindle fire. you should download it a good game get it I hope you like it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am about 40% through this book and I cannot put it down, the storyline is imaginative and detailed,  twisting into unexpected plots and counter plots at every turn. Set in some bleak,distant future The 'Main Character ' seems to change every chapter or two and, just when you think you have it all worked out- boom! it 'all changes', I'd almost go so far as to describe this as the game of thrones of sci-fi,, almost, but not quite.
0307346617|3.0|After reading Max Brook's Zombie Survival Guide and not really understanding the hype, I put off his sequel World War Z for awhile until recently. Maybe the upcoming movie has something to do with it but that PG-13 rating turned me off quickly. Anyways I started reading and was captivated by the first chapter where a zombiefied boy in China rips his flesh through his chains in order to attack our narration, but then the guy ends up getting arrested: story over. \\"Ok\\" I thought, \\"this is just the first chapter, so it's probably just a prelude for things to come\\". And they certainly did come, just very sporadically and the ratio was pretty disappointing between engaging stories and short build-up stories with abrupt anticlimactic payoffs.<br /><br />Many examples are varied and show different parts of the world reacting differently to the outbreak, which worked fine with me. The problem was the story, for all it's faux-interviewee purposes, felt very distant and uninspired. Most of the stories people hear about warning threats, see zombies, run away/get arrested, story over. When I picked up this book, I was under the impression that Max Brooks would do a good job of totally immersing me in the nightmare, and he got some things done pretty creepy (underwater hordes), the majority of the stories lack that human element that is essential for visceral story telling about a subject that fascinates so many people. For a task that seemed so easy, Max dropped the ball on this one, hard. Maybe three gripping stories come into mind, but they're all just small blinks of an eye documenting the entire thing, when I wanted more to the story. Follow one character follow a government instituted evacuation program, they watch it fail, lose their family or something, and make it out barely. I was hoping for stuff more along those lines, but instead the stories were sporadic, short, and ultimately forgettable.<br /><br />Well not all of it, there was some good creepy stuff in the story. The underwater zombies for one, the news relay ship whose Intel Reception crew all committed suicide, the Chinese blowing a horn to see if an island's infested, there were certainly a few moments here and there that were vivid and painted the apocalyptic scenario well. Overall though the book was pretty weak and disappointing considering how much attention and praise it got.The underwater zombies for one, the news relay ship whose Intel Reception crew all committed suicide, the Chinese blowing a horn to see if an island's infested, there were certainly a few moments here and there that were vivid and painted the apocalyptic scenario well.

B001DUDKEY|3.0|It's a little slow and a little confusing on all the characters. You have to keep watching to get an idea of who is who. It was ok.
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|Very unrealistic - cannot believe that one would not read those suicidal tendencies in ones own child.  The ending was OK
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A great time killer game. I feel smart every time I get past a level with success.  Glad I got, and it's free!
B000XKZQ74|5.0|The plot is clean, calm/slow  yet containing strength and excitement. The film captures details that reflect human nature and carry strength. I like to watch it again myself. Would like to  recommend it to my friend.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|It's not great, not bad. Entertaining enough to watch a few times or on a rainy day.. I was never bored during the movie.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is one of the best TV series that has ever been produced. I was addicted from the first episode.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|Initially seemed like a simple concept, but the game is hard to master. Games go for 5-10 minutes, but I find myself completely focused while playing them.<br />You'll like it once you buy it. Read instructions, though. You can flip and rotate shapes. I didn't realize that initially.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love the way that this series has concluded..... as sad as I was that Sookie and Eric did not have their happily ever after I was very happy with the way things ended up. I look forward to reading after dead to see where all our favorites end up!! Thank you Charlaine Harris for bringing these characters into our lives!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|So much easier playing on the tablet than my phone.  Enjoying playing.  Don't need to know how do draw well, just need the desire to have fun.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The puzzles are fun and  can be challenging without being frustrating. Plus the added hidden object games are a great addition. Put that all together with the story line and you have a good fun game.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|Over all I have enjoyed this game. Could be a little better on giving out bongos or items when ppl bye credits.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Very good game. Give a lot of fun.  Good graphics & sound, very enjoyable, fun & challenging puzzle game with a different twist.
1451695195|5.0|An insight into a part of life that all people are going to. Weather you believe or not it is one of those that you should read and meditate on. See you there some day.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Quick review:<br /><br />Wonderful depth and thoughtfulness<br />Compelling, dramatic world created<br />No-nonsense pace and conciseness<br />Perhaps less fun than Enders Game but more memorable.  I enjoyed it even more.  Stunning achievement.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Great summer reading material. First book forces one to read  on to the second and then you have no choice but to finish this intriguing trilogy.  Very well written, hard to put down.  A real shame that there will be no more to follow.
1469220660|5.0|Romantic with a story as well as all the passion.  I liked this series so much I have ordered the next one.  The people are real and have real problems to solve as well as having a steamy romance.
B004TI5N38|5.0|In a tight and intriguing story in a plausible and frightening way.  The story kept pulling into the next chapter. Hard to put down.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I don't even know where to start.  This story touched me to my very soul.  I was unaware of this part of our history and the thought of children being shipped to places and people who may or may not treat them as humans broke my heart.  Vivian and Molly will stay with me for a long time.  This, in my opinion, is a must read.  I will treasure the time I spent reading \\"Orphan Train\\".
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Great cast and not unnecessarily long. Plot close to book, misses a few points but not overly salient to the plot line. Watch it!
B00BQ1DBUS|2.0|Definitely not his best, though some of the new songs have his trademark beat and lyrics.  I almost wish he had thrown in a couple of his golden oldies.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|This book is fantastic and will give you a better idea of the pressure/stress he was under.Lots of info,the author did a great job of dealing with an enormous amount of  info,especially about the last years,she clearly writes from the heart.No other book has been so thoroughly researched and written so well.Now I can better understand what Michael was up against and his many contributions that go far beyond the world of music.<br />An educational experience and a must read for all!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is truly closer to a 3.5 star rating.  I certainly found it to be a page turner, but I had a pretty accurate assumption as to how things would go.  It is a very dark and heavy read, but it is very entertaining despite the fact that things happen that are very unlikely, ridiculous, and unnecessary.<br /><br />I would recommend this someone, but I did find her Dark Places and Gone Girl to be better.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my fiance, because it is her favorite movie. It was exactly what she was looking for!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Addictive! Great acting, writing, sets and attention to detail. From what I remember as a child my dad related the introductions of the new technologies is right on the mark.
0765325950|5.0|I have been reading WoT since the mid 90's and I was excited to finally see it come to a close. It didn't end the way I expected, but it was fast paced and enjoyable. If you have stuck with it through the years, then you have probably already read it. If you haven't started reading them, then get ready for a long 14 book series!
B005T87QCI|5.0|Great game I just wish you could unlock Zeus and the other players that you have to buy with money
B0085A9J18|5.0|Great movie from beginning to end. Non-stop action, I love this movie. The only minor problem<br />Is it has subtitles, but I love it nonetheless. Extremely fast delivery, would recommend to all that I know!

1616890835|5.0|As a person who grew up during the last of the sign painters, I loved this book not just for the nostalgia but the affirmation that our graphic landscape has become so pre-digested, arthritic looking cacophony as compared to the times when graphic arts were done by a hand.  It is encouraging to me that there are still active practitioners out there, too.
B0076794IO|1.0|Like so many of my fellow one-star-rating reviewers I am amazed and shocked about the positive reviews this book has received. These are entirely incomprehensible.<br /><br />On p200 of the book we read the following thoughts by the protagonist, Kate Moore: \\"That was not her husband; she knew him, and that was not him. But of course she didn't really know him\\".<br />Future readers beware: the 200 pages leading up to this point are an endless loop of versions of these three sentences.<br /><br />The whole idea of the plot is not that bad actually, but, unfortunately, it is all squeezed into the last 50 pages rather than developed over the full 300+ pages. And the main characters, besides the protagonist, are not developed at all: who are they, what drives them, Julia, Dexter, Bill? It's hard to get to the point where you actually care. And then Hayden, that super-secret, super-powered super-spy, wooooooooo...<br /><br />So Kate, the protagonist, used to be this superbly trained CIA agent, working on missions including cold-blooded assassinations. And then the author sells her to us as this insecure expat-wife, who can't even come up with a straight-faced simple lie in a foreseeable conversation with her husband???? Who can't see through her \\"friend\\" Julia installing a tracking device into her car, and on her computer, on extremely obvious occasions????? Who cold-bloodedly shoots an innocent young mother with her baby in the next room, but then lets the ultimate villain of the whole plot go free, just because she's pregnant and Kate doesn't want her \\"to give birth in prison\\"?????<br />C'mon, give us a break here.<br /><br />The tracking-device installing e.g. is SO obvious, anyone who can spell 007 sees it immediately. It's telling about what the author seems to think about his readers' intelligence that he still chooses to point our noses to it: Ah, okay, wow, so Julia just went back to the car ALONE in order to install the gps-tracking, ah, okay, now i understand, thank you, author.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Filled with the type of detail that made Fleming's work so memorable, author Damian Stevenson's novel, The Ian Fleming Files: Armada, is sure to satisfy the most discerning of 007 fans. Rich in atmosphere and historical detail from its first paragraph, it becomes instantly obvious to the reader that Stevenson has done his homework in creating a novel just as good as anything Fleming himself could have penned. Taunt, exciting, and filled with action one will not likely forget- you'll find this gem hard to put down once you crack it open. Stevenson knows his Fleming, and so will you, when read this marvelous novel where 007 steps backstage to spotlight his creator in this wartime adventure. Five stars, I wish I could give it 007!

B00APUYWYA|5.0|Any movie that can hold a room of 20 teens attention for the full movie is good by me. The story line is good as well - I'm in my 40's and I liked it. I think it is especially good in regards to being who you are. You see different races, backgrounds, and body types - which is nice for a change.

It is so refreshing to be able to listen to a whole CD, beginning to end, and want to hear it again!  Quirky, thoughtful lyrics, knitted together with funky beats and hooks make this a must have for any long-time Steely Dan / Donald Fagen fans.  Masterful!

It's also strange because the day if the week is not mon-fri but lunar days which is ok but wish I knew beforehand. I gave as a graduation gift and they loved it, the graduate is going into the military so the color and strap was great. They were shocked it was automatic and when they seem the skeleton back they fell in love with the watch!
B000U6BT40|5.0|If you like science fiction you will love this show.  Lots of great science lots of fun antics by the super nerds of the world. This is Big Ban Theory on steroids!
B008BGNMZU|5.0|You can't beat Bob James.  Ditto for Nathan East and Harvey Mason.  Now Chuck Loeb has joined the group and it is once again back , well almost, to the elegance of early days when Lee Ritenour was on guitar.  Definitely a keeper.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Powerful to see the resolve of a Godly man whose conscience has impacted the course of the greatest nation on earth. Many quotable moments and worth watching over and over.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app works great on kindle fire! The 0.7.0 update is supposed to be soon (according to the minecraft forrums it has been submitted.) So buy it now while the price is low and Mojang please update the app pupictures. (I found a glitch where you can have empty slots in creative called EmptyItemInstance.name&lt; )
B007KUFDBY|5.0|Didn't do good at the box office and had bad reviews. Rented it on DVD when it first came out and enjoyed it. About 10 years later it finally comes to Blu Ray. Great classic drawn animation w/ a little bit of CGI. Very fun movie for all ages. Lots of original and interesting cast of characters since they are mostly aliens.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|I just replaced my old Blu-Ray copy of The Terminator with this one.  it was definitely worth the purchase.  The colors are great, and the detail is amazing!  I'm not sure where they pulled the quality from, but they did, and it looks wonderful from start to finish.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This is a cute movie with a lot of great people in it! I would definitely recommend for any night in with the girls!!
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I will admit..the main reason I bought the book was in anticipation of the movie. I checked  out the reviews, and  with the good outweighing the bad, I bought it. Worst $10 I have spent on a book.<br />I have read many zombie books and this is the first one I found virtually impossible to get interested in. Since this one inspired a movie, I had high hopes. It didn't  take long to kill those hopes.<br />The ENTIRE book is one interview after another with many different characters. Very little zombie detail, and many words and phrases that required glancing at the side notes to avoid getting lost. The \\"interviews\\" each lasted 3-6 pages (at least in the beginning section, which is as far as I made it) and most of them had about the same emotion as you would expect had the book been about an H1N1 outbreak, not a zombie apocalypse.<br />1) I wish I could request a refund.<br />2) I am pleased that the movie reportedly doesn't follow the book,  which from what I heard, caused negative  predictions for the success of the movie. Personally, I think not following the book was an extremely wise choice.<br />This book had the title and the chance  to be awesome...fell so far short it doesn't even register on the scale. Do not recommend it!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I just love the different colors and the snakes and birds. Just a lot of good fun. Keep them coming. Thanks to Amazon.com.
B0039P1O4O|5.0|Works great in the car. I like the auto-pairing (after you have paired it up with your phone before) when I go in and out of my car. The battery life is amazing, I never turned it off and it managed to stay on for more than a month.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I wish I could play it all the time. It is so unique. Something I enjoy and will keep playing. Thanks Amazon.com.

B008DBF5Z8|4.0|I was worried as I ordered this IPEVO Ziggi-HD USB document camera.  I live in Los Angles, and it was a quick delivery (2 days).  As I received the package, it added more worried, because it was so light and compact, and as I unpacked - I felt it more like a toy than a device.  But all of that went away after I tested out.  The height ajustment is enough to cover a full lenght (11&#34;) of 8-1/2 x 11 paper.  There are 2 settings for focus, C (continuous) and S (single). I had it set on C and it bother some as I move the paper quit a bit as I was writing, because it's auto focus so the camera is trying to adjust that all the time I the object is moved.  However, when I set the focus to S (single), it's much better, because it only focus the fist time I put the paper in, and as long as I don't change the height adjustment, then it's stay pretty much the same.  The only down side for this camera is it doesn't have a lamp / light, so you basically can't operate in dark room at all.  IPEVO should have intergrate a USB LED light.  Other than that, I's a nice pack-n-go Doc Camera.  Now let's see how long i would last !!!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Different than what I normally read.  Saw this was going to be made into a motion picture thus my reading of it.  It was a good read, especially on our trip.

0451147367|5.0|I ordered this because I had read it when it was first published and no longer had a copy.  Hard to find even in the used paperbook stores I frequent.  Some of Stephen King's most compelling work.  &#34;The Long Walk&#34; is a classic.  I felt every step after a few pages....if you ever served in the Army or Marine Corps and did the &#34;Force March&#34; thing, you will too.  Imagine walking until everyone around you died?  Wow.....how does King come up with this stuff??

B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Gorgeous. This music is stirring, uplifting, and enchanting. I think we are going to continue to see great things from this firecracker of a violin player. It is hard for me to pick a favorite track, as they each have their own unique flavor. She uses electronic elements to enhance her music, and although I was skeptical you can now consider me a fan.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's good to hear and see what;s going on with everyone when I don't have time to pick up the phone or write a letter.

B007W0YVRO|5.0|I learned about Yiruma from a Korean teenager. She wanted to learn how to play a couple of his songs on the piano.<br /><br />I shy away from so-called &#34;new age&#34; music that is so repetitive (boring) that it makes me sleepy. However, this artist's work is both gentle and interesting. His work is also rather challenging to play.<br /><br />I have been learning of many Asian musicians whose work is creative, very well done, uplifting, and worth the money. They often combine styles that you wouldn't expect to hear together. One example that stands out to me is a sort of jazz samba done by a Japanese artist. I wish it were easier to obtain this music in the US. I prefer to purchase CDs and feel like I can better support the artists when I can buy a CD.
B0000042MY|5.0|The CD arrived quickly and in excellent shape.  The soundtrack is more deeply stirring to my blood than any imagining might have been.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|This movie kept my interest straight through.  It was classic Arnold Schwarzenegger, despite him being older. The way he would stare people in the eye, classic one liners, muscle power, and that steely determination.  All hallmarks for Arnie.<br /><br />Even though the setting was a little no-where land town, it introduced the drama of this sleek, high-speed racing car with a mysterious Mexican cartel dude who was perfect for the roll of driving that amazing machine.  But equally matched by our Arnie, who opts for a sporty red thing that matched its power, and of course, he could drive just as well as the cartel guy.<br /><br />You asked for it, you got it.  Heart pounding action, funny lines and characters, and a story that moves right along.<br /><br />I haven't purchased a DVD in quite awhile, but after seeing this, I decided I needed to have it to add to my classic Schwarzenegger collection.

B008EKOIN8|5.0|Michael Pollan is the best kind of journalist: a superb writer, who does deep, total-immersion research on a subject of great moment, and all with a light, but serious tone that looks calmly at all sides of his subject.  I have read many authors who are very impassioned about the changes we need to make about our collective relationship to food, and as well intentioned as much of that is, I find Pollan's works uniquely inform and inspire me.

0345525558|5.0|In the Language of Flowers, Diffenbaugh weaves a beautiful story about a young girl and her love of flowers.  The story begins with Victoria's 18th birthday and her emancipation from the foster system.  The other girls in her transitional home is relieved to watch her go.  The audience is perplexed by her anger and her past is a giant mystery.  Diffenbaugh parallels Victoria's current story to that of her ten year old self living with a foster parent, Elizabeth.  Even as a ten year old, she is filled with rage but beneath that was a broken fragile little girl searching for warmth and love.<br /><br />Now eighteen and emancipated, she is shoved into the real world with no real skills and no motivation to make something out of herself.  She remains broken, but prides herself on her detached attitude.  The only thing she wants it to be left alone with her flower and her tattered book of the Language of Flowers from Elizabeth.  However, even with the emancipation, she cannot sustain herself and must find a job.  Stumbling upon a part time job working for a florist, she begins to discover her own gifts, giving her a second chance at a better life.<br /><br />This is a novel about growth, and the chance at healing.  It is about optimism and perseverance.  There is only one word I can use to describe this novel: heartwrenching.  In Victoria's journey of self-discovery and realization, I felt as if I were dragged along the journey.  When she sat alone and slept outside, I felt her fear and desperation.  My heart broke along with Victoria's, and healed when she found happiness.  After reading her experiences, it made me reflect on my own life.  It made me question my ability to persevere and strength, appreciating the conditions the human heart is able to endure, and putting my own problems in perspective.  I felt myself growing with Victoria, opening my mind to the different experiences of different people.  Even though the ending seemed a bit predictable, I believe it was for the best.  The story is about her evolving into a different person and redeeming all the wrongs she had committed to those around her.  By slowly inching back into her broken life, she is realistic about her growth, which I believe is what set the story apart from any other generic \\"happy ending novel.\\"<br /><br />The story line is simple, but the writing and the incorporation of the meanings of flowers was intricately done.  The story will not disappoint, and I recommend it to all and guarantee it will show you a perspective of humanity that you may have overlooked and not realized.for the best.

B005X5XIL0|4.0|Very enjoyable CD, but not as good as watching the DVD of it.  Think the sound level varies too much and so we have to keep adjusting the volume when listening to this CD.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Excellent acting of Robert Downey Jr.<br />I can see he is the one of the best actor nowadays.<br />I really hope he gets a good role.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Pure hi-fi sound transferred from the original master tapes. Better than the mini-tapes and vinyl disks. The song performance was probably her best album, sweet and pure. You guessed it, I'm not a young person.
B007SGM084|5.0|You will be captivated from start to finish.  Definetely buy the trilogy...you won't want to stop after the first one and will hate waiting for the second to arrive.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I enjoyed the mystery.  It had many interesting twists.  One never guesses who did it until the end.  Written in words similar to Jane Austins.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is an excellent show.  My entire family loves it!  (Our youngest is 15; wouldn't recommend for young children).
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|I loved this. This was one of those stories where you should be able to kind of see what is coming at the end, but somehow you don't until you actually get there. As one can expect from this author, the characters are quirky and the story is well written and intelligent.<br /><br />You can't help but feel a bit sorry for the main character until he commits the ultimate social no no to another actor and it backfires in his face. He is one of those characters that you know you shouldn't like, but you just can't help it.<br /><br />This ties into the book by the same author brilliantly. If you have not read Mr. Whitehead's work yet, you might want to give this a try. I loved it, and I love the Gordonston ladies dog walking club as well.<br /><br />This is short, entertaining and will make you laugh. I recommend it.
B00C2VIA52|1.0|This game is fun. It also is free. I really don't like the deck building interface. I have to have at least 30 cards in every deck so can't use some I need in running decks. Can't trade cards. Get copies of cards I'll never use and it takes a lot of time just to get a card. Would be a lot of fun in team format if there was one. Hard to add friends or find any. No way to buy cards from a collection. I'd taste higher if some of these update, but for now it's a 3 just bc it's fun and free. If it wasn't free I wouldn't pay it. No competitive formal format with prizes to promote. A lot of potential. Update-they did an update and changed the cards mechanics. Not ok with this at all and am removing the game from my library. Too bad bc as annoying as some things were in game it was still fun. 1 star for developing a free game. Zero stars for integrity.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really enjoiyed this game.  Playing it for a second time.  Can do the quest or endless play.  Will probably buy II
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Great special effects although some were too far-fetched. Story was fun and maintained my interest throughout. I would recommend seeing it.

B004EF8AJA|5.0|GREAT FILM ABOUT LITTLE KNOWN ENGLISH HISTORY<br />WE REALLY ENJOED THIS 4 PART SERIES! THE WORK IN THE MILLS WAS SO HARD.
B0090SI42Y|5.0|I thought that this movie was pretty good. I thought that RZA for a first time director did a good job. I love the fact that they mixed rap wqith kung-fu. the story was a little confusing at first but if you watch the whole thing then it will make since. there is this one part that they left out and I thought that they should of left it in. when you watch the deleted scenes you'll know what I'm talking about. but all in all this was a good movie if you like kung-fu films. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B000ID37RM|5.0|Magical!! From start to finish. Long before special effects could compensate for poor screen adaptation scripts, this movie encompasses the true spirit of one of the best American novels ever written.

B003PIS5XI|4.0|Amongst all the races in the Rylos Star League , that rarest of all individuals may be the one with the innate \\"gift\\"  to become a starfighter.  Never numbering more than a few dozen, they are the League's best, last, and only line of defense  beyond that of the Frontier itself.<br /><br />Built in times long past, the Frontier  is a defensive wall of vast force shields.  It forms an almost impenetrable shield protecting that region of space containing the League and its member star systems against the limitless numbers and unmatched ferocity of the relentless Ko-Dan Empire.<br /><br />Within that region of space are many primitive, nonmember planets, deliberately kept ignorant of external affairs until their cultures are deemed sufficiently advanced for such knowledge.  On one of these planets there is a popular  arcade game called Starfighter.  Unbeknownst to its players, the game is actually both a training program and a test.<br /><br />In his last month of his senior year of high school, Alex Rogan has just played his last game of Starfighter.  Channeling all of the frustrations of his young life into a driving force,  Alex has done something no one on his planet has ever done before.  Alex has beaten the game.<br /><br />Something is coming for Alex.<br /><br />But treachery will bring low the defenses of the Star League.  In the space of less than an hour, the Frontier will be shattered and its guardians slain before they can launch.  Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada will be coming in numbers uncountable while the League, and even Earth itself, will be naked before them.<br /><br />There is no more time for games.<br /><br />There is only time for the last starfighter.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk has been around for quite some time, and they are known for being some of the pioneers to EDM Music. They are have giving us some of the most prolific house music for the past 2 decades including hits like \\"One More Time\\", \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\", & \\"Around The World\\". However, with the release of their new album in 8 years (not including the Tron: Legacy Soundtrack), Daft Punk has decided to abandon their famously known House sound and shift towards the roots of the music that inspired their sound in the first place. Random Access Memories is one of the most beautifully constructed albums of pure sounds that I have heard in 2013, mixing 70's and 80's disco with classical music as well as some rock, this album is a testament to their artistry as musicians. The album begins with \\"Give Life Back to Music\\" which is a pretty bold statement with the title alone, starting with a rock intro quickly changing into a disco groove for the ages. The infectious bass guitar really will make you groove the second it hits you. \\"The Game of Love\\" is a slow jam, but a good one at that, compared to the other songs on this album it won't hold up but I love the sentiment of the lyrics in this song. \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\" features a monologue by Giorgio Moroder himself speaking about his musical experience and his discovery of how synthesizers enhance his musical spectrum, this is by far the most ambitious song on RAM showcasing their eclectic ear for music combining Progressive Rock, Disco, Classical and Techno; running at 9 Minutes long, this song is a journey into the minds of Daft Punk.<br /><br />Next up we have the breathtaking \\"Within\\" featuring the talented Canadian pianist Chilly Gonzales, featuring a very reminiscent slow rhythmatic beat you would normally hear from pop ballads back in the 80's and in comparison this a slow version of \\"Digital Love\\" from their Discovery album back in 2001. Gonzales's piano playing in this song almost brought a tear to my eye. Then we have Songs like \\"Instant Crush\\", a very catchy pop song that I can hear on the radio today. The collaborated songs featuring Pharrell Williams of \\"Lose Yourself to Dance\\" and \\"Get Lucky\\" are some of the catchiest songs on this album that I am 1005 certain will play at dance parties for the new and old generations to get their groove on to. My personal favorite of the album would have to be \\"Touch\\" with Paul Williams. The beginning half of the song sounds nice and foot tapping good, but it's the incredible second half of the song that transcends this song into new heights. The atmospheric strings playing throughout, and heavenly choir vocals in the background literally makes you feel like you are in another world. \\"Beyond\\" is another 70's song featuring a similar bassline with Daft Punks signature keyboards. \\"Motherboard\\" is probably the only song that is nostalgic to their old material from past albums and even the Tron soundtrack, but also features some of the most disturbing sound effects mixed in between as if some type of plasma is being released, it's some weird trippy stuff.<br /><br />\\"Fragments of Time\\" really reminds me of a song Phoenix would conjure up, but I like the song for what it is; it's a song for the summertime on the beach with some cheesy lyrics for people to enjoy and have a good time. \\"Doin It Right\\" feat. Panda Bear is my least favorite track with some of the most repetitive and annoying lyrics I've heard, even for Daft Punk. This is throwback to a corny 80's song with a simplistic beat. Thankfully the album ends on a high note with \\"Contact\\", I love this song, it really reminded me why I loved Daft Punk in the first place because they are able to create music that makes people feel music and this song is a perfect example. The amazing drums and feeling as if you are lifting off into another realm is amazing. For those who are avid music fans, this is a must buy. Random Access Memories is a carefully crafted album and really a laborof love for Daft Punk who really took the time and energy to create an album that is incredibly cohesive from beginning to end with only a couple of minor missteps towards the end. And for the Daft Punk fans that are bashing this album because the sound is different from their past material should be ashamed of themselves. I loved \\"Homework\\" and especially \\"Discovery\\", but Daft Punk are musicians first and foremost that really care about their craft, and I am astounded by their musicianship with this album. This is their best album since Discovery and one of the best albums of 2013, and if you think this album is bad, then I'm sorry but you have no appreciation for good music.<br /><br />Favorite 5:<br />1) Touch feat. Paul Williams<br />2) Giorgio by Mororder<br />3) Get Lucky feat. Pharrell Williams<br />4) Give Life Back to Music<br />5) Contactof love for Daft Punk who really took the time and energy to create an album that is incredibly cohesive from beginning to end with only a couple of minor missteps towards the end.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|David Gelb's excellent documentary describes with the extraordinary sensitivity of an ethnographer Jiro Ono, Japan's leading sushi &#34;shokunin&#34; (master). It shows Jiro's hard-worn excellence, supreme artistry of the natural, dogged discipline not just of himself but of his two sons and staff, uncanny empathy with his customers, surprising openness to improvement and creativity even at the age of 85, and passion for the two foods-- seafood and rice-- which have symbolized life and defined his people. A must-see for anthropologists, gourmets, Nippon-philes, and anyone who cares about the universal transcendant human spirit in the face of change and aging.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I was really worried when I read the other reviews that I would be disappointed; but Harris has delivered a great Sookie book. I think she did her character justice and tied up enough loose ends so the reader can be very pleased at the outcome. If you like this series you will enjoy this book.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Brilliant story,read it in a couple of sessions on two consecutive rainy days,would recommend it to anyone.Have kept an eye open for others by same author.
B003G4W49C|2.0|Ender's Game just didn't do it for me. Too much time spent describing the battles in the battle room (yawn) and too many references to naked children (just kidding on that one but really...) Another one of those books like the Hunger Games that everybody seems to love but I just can't get into.
B00BDSRISA|5.0|The first time I listened to the songs, I wasn't too fond of them. By the second time around, they started to grow on me where now I really love every song on the album and can't get enough of Phoenix! Fantastic album.

030758836X|1.0|I loved the beginning of the book, I just couldn´t stop reading it.  I even recomended it to my friends (thank God they didn´t buy it).  But the ending ruins everything!!  I can´t believe it had such a bad ending.  I´m never reading Gillian Flynn´s books again.  I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought it!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a lot like most people's experiences of growing up and the struggles teenagers face. Perfect for me because I am going to high school next year and need to know the challenges I will face there. It was also very interesting to read from Charlie  point of view and how his past influenced his future.

B004NOH9LC|4.0|Harrison Ford is a delightful curmudgeon in this entertaining film. I enjoyed all the actors' performances and the story was charming.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read another review that compared this book to [[ASIN:1476741182 Wallbanger]] so I had to give this book a shot.  Actually as much as I liked Wallbanger this book was even better.  I loved Drew's POV and his direct conversation with the reader (not sure what that writing style is called but it was fun).  This book has comedy, chemistry, conflict, and great sexy moments.  I liked the supporting characters too (especially Drew's niece).  I'm looking forward to reading more books from this author.
B00CWV8X04|1.0|This may be an unfair rating, but I gave it one star because I lost interest in the movie after about 20 minutes and turned it off. I found it to be boring and uninteresting. I hadn't read any previews and didn't know what to expect, but in general I expect a movie to at least give me one reason to keep watching - and this one didn't.
0525952926|3.0|The book began well but then Follet's writing deteriorated into attempts to shock the reader and he killed off many of the previously well-developed characters.  The book became very slow reading and it seemed as if the author was &#34;putting in his writing time&#34; to get the project done.  I will likely wait for the third book to be at the library.
0525952926|4.0|The book House of Secrets was truly disappointing and not at all worthy of the recommendations on the jacket. Very poorly written and not anything at all like Harry Potter.
B00BQ1D7X4|2.0|Yes that's right folks I listened to this gem on Spotify this morning. You see I don't pre-order or buy music in general until I've had a chance to sample the goods. That's what makes services like Spotify or Deezer so appealing. Moving on to the album now I must admit that the two pre-released tracks had my hopes high that this album would be better than Black Gives Way to Blue, where Duvall was actually heard in clarity, but boy was I wrong. Not only is this album radio music but it's drowned out by Jerry Cantrell's backing vocals. Did I say backing vocals? Let me change that to Jerry Cantrell's lead vocals seeing as how he sings over Duvall on just about every song. Never mind Jerry's quote on clashmusic.com where he says and I quote \\"It's a solid record - it's the best record we could make. We dig it, so hopefully everybody else does too. The reception to it so far has been great - it's a good start, early on.\\" end quote. I think I'll leave it at that for now. Jerry just summed it up for us...this is the best record they could make. RIP AnC.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I really liked this book. I was unsure if it would be all about camping and not have much character development, but I was wrong about that. You really got to know each of the characters and understand them.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Out of all the Hunger Games books, this one was my favorite. Unlike the first two books, this one has some action right away. Obviously you have read the first two and could tell how good of a author Suzanne Collins is. What I really enjoyed was that Collins left the author wanting to read more at the end of every chapter. I am a high school student and I dont really enjoy reading, but these three books, especially this one, were books that I actually enjoyed. Obviously you've had to read the first two, but if you havent read this one yet, get it right away, its an amazing book.

B0015DROBO|2.0|The only reason I am giving this book two stars is because I didnt finish it. This was one of the most confusing books I have read. Im a high school student and I think I read at a high to moderate level, and this was way too confusing to continue reading. I read about 170 pages and I had to stop. What was really confusing was all the charactors in the book. I would be reading the book and not knowing which charcter was talking and who they were talking about. From what I was reading though it looked like a really good plot for a book. Ive heard all positive of this book, and maybe one day I'll pick it up again and try to read it.

B004SUSZB4|1.0|I hated this book. I thought the dialog was dreadful and Cecelia is a horrible writer. The story was boring and the main character is a pain. I checked it out from my local library with high hopes because I absolutely love the movie (I am so happy that I only wasted my time on it and not both my money and my time). I was so incredibly disappointed. The screenwriters did a marvelous job on the movie. Don't waste your valuable time on the book - or your valuable money. Watch the movie instead.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works very well and the screen looks just like the shot. very nice, fabulous download - will be great for travel too.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Just a really bad, all around movie. Many better movies to watch out there, even with Tom in them.<br />This was just not that great. If you are passing the time and really at the end of your movie list the go right ahead.
B00CSYR432|5.0|(Note: this is a review of the movie, not of the DVD. Based on other reviews, I would advise potential buyers to be cautious about the quality of the specific DVD being sold.)<br /><br />From Up on Poppy Hill (Kokuriko-zaka Kara) is nothing less than the best Studio Ghibli film since 2004's Howl's Moving Castle, possibly even since 2001's Spirited Away. Directed by Goro Miyazaki from a screenplay by Hayao Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa, From Up on Poppy Hill is based on a 1980 serialized Japanese graphic novel of the same name, illustrated by Chizuru Takahashi and written by Tetsuro Sayama. The animation is lush and lovingly detailed, and the story an engaging tale of two high school students dealing with first love and with the importance of the past, both on a cultural and institutional level, and, as it turns out, on an intimately personal level as well.<br /><br />The story is set in 1963 in the port town of Yokahama in Japan in 1963 against the backdrop of the country getting ready to host the 1964 Olympic Games. Umi Matsuzaki is a sixteen-year-old high school girl living with her family and a couple of boarders in a house on top of a hill that overlooks the harbor. Her mother Ryoko, a medical professor, is currently away, studying abroad in the United States. In her mother's absence, Umi runs the house and looks after her younger siblings, Sora and Riku, and her grandmother, Hana. The boarders, both women, are an artistic college student named Sachiko Hirokouji and a doctor-in-training named Miki Hokuto. Umi's father, we learn, died many years ago when Umi was quite young, killed when his cargo ship hit a mine during the Korean War. As a kind of ritual to his memory, each morning Umi raises a set of naval signal flags up a flagpole outside the house with the message \\"Safe Voyage\\" to the ships out in the harbor.<br /><br />One day, an anonymous poem about the flags appears in the school newspaper. Curious, Umi decides to visit the school newspaper to ask who wrote the poem. The school paper is published out of an office located in a delapidated old building on the school grounds nick-named \\"the Latin Quarter\\" which houses all of the school clubs and has done so for as long as anyone can remember. But the Latin Quarter is now endangered by a plan to tear it down and replace it with a brand new building as part of Japan's modernization program to put on its best face for the upcoming Olympics, a move that has the students divided between those who want everything to be new and those who have an emotional attachment to the old and traditional, which they see embodied by their beloved Latin Quarter.<br /><br />On the way to visit the paper's office, Umi, accompanied by Sora, witness another student, Shun Kazama, performing a daredevil stunt to get publicity for the paper's \\"Save the Latin Quarter\\" drive. Umi is somewhat less than impressed by Shun's feat, but when she reaches the school paper office, she discovers that Shun, along with his friend Shiro Mizunuma who is the student government president, is the publisher of the school paper (and also, as she learns later, the author of the poem about her flags). Before she knows it, Umi is volunteering to help, first with the paper, preparing stencils, and then soon with their drive to save the Latin Quarter. She suggests that the best way to start would be to give the building a complete facelift, first with a thorough cleaning and then with much needed repairs and a fresh paint job. In this cause, Umi enlists the school's female student population, which in turn gets the male students guickly - and enthusiastically - on board.<br /><br />As they work together, Umi and Shun start feeling a growing attraction to each other. But the path of young love is rarely smooth, and theirs is thrown for a bigger curve than most when Umi shows Shun a photograph of three young naval men, one of whom is her deceased father. But Shun has seen this photograph before, and suddenly a past neither of them were previously aware of begins to assert itself, complicating their budding relationship before it's properly begun. From that point on, the twin plot threads - of Umi and Shun and their pasts and of the students' crusade to save the Latin Quarter - are subtly intertwined. To say more would be to spoil the story.<br /><br />The animation in From Up on Poppy Hill is wonderfully detailed and executed in so many ways it would take a long time to properly describe them. The Latin Quarter clubhouse is a marvel of clutter, completely believable as the sort of old place whose every corner would be filled with incredibly varied bric-a-brac due to the myriad kind of clubs it houses (and going for years without a proper cleaning because that's not typically a high priority with most boys).<br /><br />Another thing I particularly liked were the subtle changes in the backgrounds as evening approached in some scenes; you could feel the sun slowly beginning to set with the ever-so-slight lengthening of shadows and changes in the hue of the sky. Equal detail was given to the way the characters moved and the things they did. In one scene, when Umi is preparing dinner, she pours the rice into a square box, then carefully runs a flat edge over the top to level it so that the amount measured out is exact. It's a minor detail not dwelled upon, but one of many similar ones that give the film a depth of reality rarely found in most animated films.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended for anyone who loves beautiful animation, engaging characters and truly first-class story-telling that never condescends to its audience.m were previously aware of begins to assert itself, complicating their budding relationship before it's properly begun.

B009UAO1ZG|4.0|This is a substantial and detailed book that I found easy to read initially. It takes on a topic that in its simplest form is America's willingness to get involved in World War II in Europe. It expands that topic in a way that I was for the most part completely unaware; there were various factions in this country that did not support american involvement in the war.<br />Unlike the war in the Pacific, the United States was not attacked on the home front. Many thought that a separation by continent left the U.S. immune from invasion. In fact, many people felt Hitler was no threat to America.<br />Charles A. Lindbergh, aviation pioneer, is used as a figurehead in this book for the isolationist point of view. As one of the most renown public figures who took a stance against entry into the war, he is still from historical perspective identified for his very public opinion. However, as this book clearly shows, he was not alone in this sentiment. Many prominent Americans were quite verbal about why America should not go to war for a variety of reasons. Some were motivated by greed, racism, classism, and adopted an 'it can't happen here' attitude. Author Lynne Olson does an admirable job of recreating an America of 70+ years ago that really isn't all that different than the America we know today.<br />Olson contrasts the isolationist point of view with that of FDR and his supporters. What began with England facing bankruptcy and FDR aide Harry Hopkins engineering 'Lend Lease' to help the brits out of a near certain invasion by Germany soon became a forgone conclusion that America was slowly inching toward its own entry into the war.<br />What appealed to me about this book was that it was an exciting story that detailed a lot of issues espoused by some very prominent people. It educated me and informed me as to why many leaders felt war was inevitable and also provided me with many reasons why people advocated isolationisms.<br />Well researched, written, and historically accurate, the author tells an interesting story that is appealing to anyone interested in history of this period.accurate, the author tells an interesting story that is appealing to anyone interested in history of this period.

However, I would definitely keep this movie away from kids, at least until they are old enough to read the book first.

The girls were excellent actresses but the adults in the movie were less inspiring.

B0043URV5U|5.0|This is a great 2 cd collection of Bob Seger, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars. However, it lacks some good songs which I know is the case for every best of collection.  You can't please everyone.  I would have liked it to include songs such as Even now, The Fire Inside, Real Love and possibly some earlier songs he had.  I could have done without the Little Drummer Boy and Shakedown also, and put in place some other songs, but that is my personal preference.  I think on the first 2 greatest hits cd's he has out they didn't include Real Love, Even Now...not sure why because those are great songs.  I do recommend to pick up the Fire Inside album and you will have a nice 3 cd collection along with this.  It's all about preference if you would prefer to buy this or his 2 cd Greatest Hits 1 and 2 that are out as well based on the track selection you want.  I chose this based on the price and the 2 cd's included.  Regardless, the music is great.

B005LJETYI|4.0|Ground hog day was a movie I liked a lot. Animé is a genre that I like a lot. This book is like a marriage of both, in prose. The action is very well described, you feel like you are in it. The introduction was satisfactory and the ending was sad. This story feels a bit short though, when it ends the war does not end. In a way that is both good and bad. The door is open for the adventures of the young hero to continue, either in book form or any other media. Let us hope it does, I would love to see or read how it will all end.

B007RCJNDE|3.0|I hope Robert Jordan's epic saga was going to be a trilogy to start with, but after 14 volumes of women pulling their pony tails at the ignorance of men folk & spurious inane embellishment of the boy meets girl scenario....I was hoping Mr. Sanderson could pick up the pieces. And I think he has done a marvelous job of it! It's been a while since my last sortie into the Wheel of time but I could not discern any obvious change in writing style or feel of the book. I am happy it has finally ended but stick to my belief that there were at least 6 volumes too many. Surely it wasn't the writers desire to express requiring such length, call me cynical but I believe contracts will publishers & the mighty dollar have diluted what could have been a great addition to the increasingly high profile of the science fiction/fantasy genre.

B005HESJYS|4.0|i came back to watching star trek and i was surprised how dated it seemed. it was so cutting edge in my time (when it was airing originaly). after watching all the modern tv shows, reality, and things, it just seems funny.<br /><br />but nevertheless its a good show and i enjoyed it.
B005RJ6AIK|2.0|I received it with broken case...<br />I was going to give it to my friend as a gift, so I'm not happy with that....

B003WUYRGI|2.0|Wish you could search for certain words<br />I've definitely seen and used better<br />I prefer just a real normal dictionary
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|A fun way to use many of those brain functions that don't get used too much as you get older. It's stimulating, causing you to think several moves ahead, like chess, except it's not that hard, lol! It's not a mindless game, so you don't feel guilty for taking a little break for yourself during the day b/c you're still using your brain even as you relax. Great game for all ages!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great music and a fun movie.  Great for the entire family.  Some really funny scenes.  Typically predictable plot, but so what?  Movies like this are for the fun & comedy.
0920668372|4.0|We gave this book to my adult brother right after our Mom died, as he had been caring for (and carrying)her in those weeks leading up to her death.  It is very touching and, I thought, beautifully done.  But it is NOT FOR CHILDREN.  It is an adult's book, and I have had a problem seeing it marketed as a child's book.  I would think it could be very disturbing for children. I'd easily give it 5 stars if it were not marketed as a book for young people.  You only really appreciate it when you're an adult and have seen a parent become dependent, especially if you have helped care for that parent.

B00886XQO0|4.0|These headphones are excellent for being wireless.  It has plenty of sound options with bass and are very comfortable.  The charge on them lasts around 8 hours which is pretty good.<br /><br />The only cons I can think of is that it's ridiculously expensive like as much as a ps3(at the time).  The other con that is annoying is that it can shut off on you after a few minutes of watching Hulu.  Okay, well I mean 10 minutes.  Basically, if you're not using the headset to play games and watching tv or movies instead, it \\"might\\" shut off on you after minutes.
B00499NHLC|5.0|After hearing several people talk about this series, I had to check it out.  And I wasn't disappointed.  Witty dialog, fast paced, and intreguing story lines.  What more can you ask for?
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|If you like shows like justified or the wire you will like this series. You should go watch it right now
B000005IRG|5.0|A lot of people seem to think that punk was only the hardcore/anarchist movement that spawned tons of fast paced songs with nothing but power chords and yelling. Don't get me wrong. That movement was hugely influential and I really like it a lot too. But often I think people forget about the other punks. I'm talking about bands like Wire, Talking Heads, Gang of Four and, of course, Television. With this release, these guys show extremely proficient musicianship and songwriting skills. The most amazing thing about this album is that it flows so well. With most albums you'll sit there, listen to the first four songs and then maybe keep going if you're in the mood. With this, each song works with the ones before to make an unified statement, not just lyrically, but musically as well. The guitar interplay between Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd gives off a strong classic rock vibe, not unlike The Allman Brothers, yet at the same time it creates a wholly unique sound. The rhythm section also deserves recognition, with some fat bass lines and extremely tight drums to back the two guitarists. Overall, this album is probably in the top five albums of 1977, the year when punk exploded onto the scene.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game, it is fun to breed dragons and getting new dragons. Just have to have some patience with it. But it is fun if you don't mind the wait while breeding dragons and waiting on them to hatch.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Out of pure curiosity and the fact that I couldn't escape this book because I kept hearing so much about, against my better judgement I decided to read this. I'm just not into the whole dominant/submissive; abusive; psychological abuse, I've read enough reviews to not finish series
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|I've seen \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" twice now. I don't think it's as good as the first reboot film, but it's better than I feared. And there's a massive logical flaw towards the end that probably no one besides me cares about. But I hate it.<br /><br />The thing I disliked about the first film was its whole premise, the altered timeline. I don't want an alternative future developing without Vulcan. So even if the film was very good, I worried where its sequels would take us.<br /><br />On that score there's no problem in this film. Sort of a reworked homage to \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" (also the second film in its series), it works. I especially like the revamp of a scene from the end with the roles of Kirk and Spock reversed.<br /><br />There are flaws...there's no explanation for the weird landscape on Qo'noS (a supposedly deserted province is covered with buildings, albeit in ruins), the scene with actress Alice Eve in her underwear was totally unnecessary, and while Benedict Cumberbatch was great in his role, the role of Khan required either someone who looks like Ricardo Montalan or who looks like a Sikh.<br /><br />But it's the logical flaw at the end that really bothers me.<br /><br />(Spoiler alert)<br /><br />The shoot out in space supposedly happens close to the Earth, only 280,000 kilometers away. That's closer than the Moon, so the part about the Enterprse being pulled towards the Earth after the battle works.<br /><br />But there's no way that shoot out can take place so close to such a huge audience, to make any sense at all it has to be secret. At that distance, not only would the whole planet be watching, the surrounding space would be filled with ships. No way comms would be out, no way the admiral would be allowed to destroy another Federation ship, no way there wouldn't be ships and space stations helping the crashing Enterprise.<br /><br />(It's a bit like there being absolutely no ships left close by when Alderaan gets destroyed. Where'd they all go?)
B00001OH7N|5.0|For me, the most enduring Bowie album - if only 'cause I've heard Ziggy Stardust & the others that followed so many times, some of that music's lost some of its power for me.  Whereas I spent a lot of time with this one soon after it was released, to let it sit for, sometimes, years, before replaying.<br /><br />Lately I've heard & read a fair amount of discussion & analysis re: the \\"dark\\" aspects of this album.  Funny. I've just always thought it one of the most rocking things I'd heard to date. It continues to be one of my fave all-time rock albums. It was the first time (I'm aware of) hearing Mick Ronson, who has a lot to do with the ferocity & dynamics of most songs here. Cases in point:  Black Country Rock, Width of a Circle, & the crunch that kicks in after the quieter beginning of All the Madmen. Of course there's She Shook Me Cold. Serious rock; influenced to a degree by Marc Bolan.
B0011MZOEI|2.0|After watching this, I checked the critical reviews online to see if anyone shared my opinion. I couldn't put it better than the reviewer from the New York Daily News:<br />&#34;The action in this fast-paced, hysterically overproduced and surprisingly entertaining film is as realistic as a Road Runner cartoon.&#34;<br />I mean, I can suspend disbelief and enjoy a good popcorn movie, but this one pushed the limits.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Great clothes and furnishings. I'm rooting for Peter, not crazy about Will and Alisha is getting too arrogant these days.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|The best part about this movie is that if you haven't ever seen Star Trek, you can still watch this movie and feel like you haven't missed anything.  The reason....well you need to watch the movie to believe me but it's absolutely true!!  Enjoyed the movie and saw the 2nd one in theaters. :)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a wonderful follow up to Bared to You and I cannot WAIT for the third book to come out!
B004W4CK44|4.0|Wonderful.  New.  Edgy.  Really enjoy the eclectic mix of Hazmat Modine, Jun Miyake, Cujo (Fatass Joint) and Thom Hanreich.  &#34;Shake it&#34; (Hanreich) will make you laugh.  &#34;Mémoires de Futur&#34; (Aubry) is very touching
B00847KFDS|5.0|This man is a musical genius and continues to release quality music! I just listened to this CD, and all I can say is AWESOME!! I absolutely love the reworking of these familiar CCR/Fogerty classics. You can tell that John put in a lot of thought and input into each selection, incorporating each individual guest artist's style and experimenting with new instrumentation and audible techniques that in my opinion make the songs sound absolutely new and original.<br /><br />The two new songs on the CD; \\"Mystic Highway\\" and \\"Train Of Fools\\" are also great. They work very well with the other songs making this a very satisfying and enjoyable listen.<br /><br />If you enjoy Creedence Clearwater Revival and John Fogerty's other solo work, then I highly recommend getting this CD. You won't be disappointed!!

B00BHU9BV6|2.0|The whole movie within a play within a movie element did not work for me.  It made the film look cheap.  Anna Karenina is a great tragic story; this movie kind of made it quirky and campy.  Hollywood should have done a better job.
0307346617|2.0|2.5 stars.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this book. While it didn't exactly disappoint, it wasn't what I expected. I've heard the words \\"thrilling\\" and \\"terrifying\\" used to describe it - neither of which it was. Supposedly, it's THE zombie genre book to read, but I'm not convinced that is true. The story is told in a series of interviews and on one hand, it was interesting reading about the zombie war from different perspectives, from people in different parts of the world. I particularly enjoyed the interview with Tomonaga Ijiro, the blind former gardener and survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, who becomes head of a Japanese defense force committed to ridding their lands of the living dead. A couple others stood out as well, like Colonel Christina Eliopolis, a pilot who crashes and is basically rescued by a woman on a radio ... and Captain Chen, the captain of a rogue Chinese nuclear submarine (just imagining the hordes of zombies underwater was really creepy, not to mention the claustrophobia I felt thinking of living underwater all that time). Unfortunately, aside from them, I found myself quite bored with the book. It felt like I was waiting for something pivotal to happen, something to really knock my socks off, but it never comes. I think part of the problem is that the story is told in the past tense ... everything has already happened, you know the storytellers have survived ... so there's none of the raw suspense you'd expect in a book about a war against zombies. You also don't have a chance to get attached to any one character - you move from interview to interview, story to story - so it ends up feeling more like reading a newspaper: impersonal and detached. Not my thing. I will say, Max Brooks has covered all the details of fighting zombies - it's clear he's put a lot of thought into what could happen and how society would be affected. It just wasn't enough for me.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this movie but I really liked it.  There was an unusual cast of stars but the whole cast was fantastic.<br />The supernatural elements worked with the story....100 % better than those in the awful Twilight &#34;quadrilogy&#34;

B00CL66FEQ|4.0|This movie was very enjoyable.  It was a bit predictable and a little sappy, but I really liked it.  What, a comedy without filth and 18,000 \\"F\\" words?  Yes, they do still make them.  I know it's hard to believe.  I walked away from this movie feeling good about it and myself, of which I just can't say about many of the movies made lately.  Although Barbara Streisand is not my favorite person, she performs beautifully in this film as the overbearing/butting in mother.  Seth Rogen is his usual funny/quirky self and shows a lot of heart in this film.  I recommend it...especially if you want a fairly clean comedy.  There were some suggestive scenes, some drinking and a few bad words (including at least one \\"F\\" word)...so it's still not for kids, but given most of the alternatives lately...I was pleased.  :)
B000I186FW|5.0|I stumbled across this movie being referenced as inspiration for some who have joined/became Anonymous.  Since I hadn't heard of it (I don't own a television and seldom go to movies), I was intrigued.  I really liked it; it was thoughtful, thought provoking, uncomfortable at times, and has a lot to say about the nature of heroics, privilege, power, strength, ethics and conformity.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have (and it is a minor one) is that the ending is highly improbable in our modern society.  I do realize this was based on a comic book, so reality is not particularly relevant to the story.  As the inspiration for Anonymous, however, it's worth realizing there are more things to consider/prepare for than the ending we have in this movie.

B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I read this book very slowly and carefully with countless highlights and notes. However, I am afraid that it had the opposite result that Dawkins would like. Reading this book as carefully as I did actually made me more confident than ever for following God.<br /><br />I give this book 5 out of 5 stars because it is a very good book, well written, and well researched. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars because it is actually a help for Christianity.<br /><br />Simply put, Dawkins says (at location 2101 (kindle page)), \\"The origin of life only had to happen once. We therefore can allow it to have been an extremely improbable event.\\"<br /><br />Later, he indirectly confirms his belief in the supernatural by saying (location 2299), \\"God, or any intelligent, decision-taking, calculating agent, would have to be highly improbable.\\"<br /><br />In the first quote he confesses that the origin of life is to be highly improbable and in the second quote he confirms that the existence of God is highly improbable. To me, it seems as though he is admitting that the existence of God is a logical choice.<br /><br />I know that there are many, many other arguments against this book and there are many, many arguments for this book. Bottom line, I enjoyed this book but due to his logic I am more confident than ever in being a God believing Christian.

B00475AYJQ|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller series presents a delightful, well-developed story currently unfolding in two books: The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear. A third book is forthcoming. That's a good thing since the first two books are really well done with an interesting cast of characters, a fresh treatment of the fantasy realm and an intriguing world (especially the University) in which they live. It's also good because the first two books cannot stand on their own. This is really one book in serial format with relatively arbitrary stopping points. I'm a little like Darcy  at the mid-point of Pride and Prejudice; \\"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love...\\" the Kingkiller Chronicles despite the fact that having no end to the first two books rankles. (Does that make Mr. Rothfuss Elizabeth? Oh, that's a little bit scary.) OK, mini rant out of the way, now onto the books themselves.<br /><br />Kvothe is one of my favorite heroes. Full stop. More than Gandalf, Aragorn or even Superman? Yes, they're too perfect. More than Harry Potter and Luke Skywalker? Yes, they're too whiny. More than Batman or Ender Wiggins? Yes, while complex they're have a bit of the antihero about them; Batman obviously more so. First, Kvothe is a hero in the epic sense of that word but fully human. The protagonist, John Smith, from I Am Number 4 has been called the hero of this generation by Michael Bay. Well, he's a pretty self-focused hero that does get pulled out of himself during the story, but it takes some pretty serious work. No, Kvothe has our desires and drives but magnified. He isn't pursuing the \\"great adventure\\" but rather pursues the adventure before him. He is pursuing justice (or revenge) but continues to fully live life before him. He has all of our selfishness, yet fully commits himself on behalf of others. He can be narrow minded but is willing to learn. In short, he is a genuine, true hero writ on a large scale while maintaining human proportions.<br /><br />So what is it I like so much about these books; why am I driven to stay up too late reading them? First, Kvothe is an engaging character in whom I fully vested. Second, the supporting cast is rich, with interesting relationships with whom you always want to spend some more time. You know an author is doing his job when you wish for more. Third, the world and its cultures are rich and intriguing. Finally, it's a fine narrative with enough of the dust and weariness of the world drawn in to make it interesting and real feeling without being so dark as to make it depressing, which I find too often these days. I like having a real hero and a world worth preserving. Dystopia is interesting but can be pretty depressing.<br /><br />***Light spoilers***<br /><br />I've already highlighted Kvothe, so let's turn to the Chronicles a great cast of supporting characters,  Sim & Wil, loyal and funny true mates.  Bast & Devi, both dangerous, untamed with mostly caring hearts. Each of whom have interesting relationships with one another and Kvothe. There is the enigmatic Denna; to say she is Kvothe's love interest is to simplify a strange and interesting relationship. There are so many more, from the University's Masters (especially Master Namer, Elodin, to Vashet of the Adem.<br /><br />It has interesting cultures and people from the Edema Ruh (gypsy-like)  to the Adem (semi-taoist fighters). So while I fuss at Mr. Rothfuss for not completing each book in the series, the journey is fabulous. Like other great fantasy writers, Rothfuss has the ability to make you believe you are having a glimpse into a real world with its own history, in this case,  told from Kvothe's perspective. I particularly like the mechanism Mr. Rothfuss uses for sharing this story: a chronicler or scribe to whom he tells his life story, even though he is still relatively young. This allows both a breathing space for perspective on the narrative and allows the story to foreshadow coming events in ways we cannot fully guess in the second book. This is also where the stories stop for the book to end.<br /><br />The narrative has a nearly perfect balance of topic, such as the University or the Adem, occasional action - such as the opening battle against Scrael or later against the apparent tax bandits with turned out to be mercenary soldiers led by one of the Chandrian. It is the Chandrian, who are woven lightly throughout the story, who tie the disparate sub-plot and settings together. By the end of the second book, we have a few puzzle pieces but not the picture.<br /><br />Mr. Rothfuss brings all of these characters, settings, sub-plots and relationships together in a truly epic tale.ve on the narrative and allows the story to foreshadow coming events in ways we cannot fully guess in the second book.

193700788X|1.0|**Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />I started reading the Sookie books after book 6 was released. I remember flipping through the first 6 books with such ferocity and enjoyment. I couldn't get enough of the story, the characters and the feeling it left me with in each ending. That 'feeling' of satisfaction and resolve ended somewhere during \\"Dead and Gone\\" (Book 9). It just hasn't been the same for me since...<br /><br />'Dead Ever After' the last book in the series was a failure to me in many ways. Main characters were written off lazily and with no true testament to the storyline we have come to know and love throughout the series. I am almost heartbroken it ended the way it did, not because Sookie ended up with Sam. I knew it was heading that way many books ago (due to the obvious way CH was handling Sookie's love life). I was saddened to read this book as if it was geared towards a grade school student. The Third Person Storyline with \\"The Devil\\" was just absurd and to use the word convenient again, is an understatement. There was little to no imagination in the story telling and honestly it was flat-line boring. I found myself rolling my eyes at several points in reading 'Dead Ever After'. The Eric marriage story line was a pathetic attempt to write him off just to open the doors to a Sam & Sookie relationship. It was not believable to me and I kept waiting for Eric to break his wedding plans off to Freyda. That is the Eric I know and remember earlier in the series. The Sam ending, (although I knew it was coming only due to the laziness in the last 4 books) was ridiculous due to the fact that throughout the series there has not been an ounce of build up to it. The continuity was off and left much to be desired as not much of DEA made sense.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed in the last few books of this series but had to finish it to see it through. I almost wished I had quit reading at 'From Dead to Worse'. If you are new to the series, I would suggest stoppingwith 'From Dead to Worse'. Let that be your last book...
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I like Gameloft games, and this one is definitely at the top of my favorites!<br /><br />The graphics are awesome, gameplay is smooth and controls are easy to get the hang of.

B003NHRGSQ|3.0|More of my reviews can be found on my blog @ http://littlepiecesofimagination.blogspot.com/<br /><br />In my opinion, the sequel was weaker than the first book and although I started to like Isabel in the first one, I felt like her coldness and compassionless, while the story was being told by her point of view, left me compassionless towards her. I could not create any kind of a bond with Cole St. Clair and I guess it's the main thing I didn't like about the book. His dark past did not affect me at all, neither did his efforts to get away from his past and apathy towards the people encircling him. The whole continuous drug addiction, coldness and apathy just lost all its value, appeal and I just got tired of reading it. As for the end of the book, I started to have some empathy towards him and I was curious, I must admit, but it was superficial.<br /><br />There were some moments in the novel which shined brightly, but everything else was just like a black stain on a white cloth and it ruined all the other parts. It's just my opinion and I'm more than sure, that there are a lot of people who enjoyed the sequel and maybe even considered it better than the first one. I liked that the roles changed and that the ending of Linger\\" was sad and desperate. It wasn't that much of a shock, because Stiefvater was trying to sail this boat towards this kind of an ending and she tried to keep the tension and suspicion, I kind of expected it, but I still felt for all four of them. At the end of it. When it comes to Grace, than I had a mixture of feelings: on one hand, I was happy about her, because it was something she had always wanted, since she was a little girl, but on the other hand, I was sad, because she had everything she wanted and it all came crashing down just in a few moments. Moments!<br /><br />Overall, the sequel was progressing pretty fast, if I all the parts of Cole's past are not considered, and I do not regret reading it, but if I ought to read about the wolves of Mercy Falls again some day, I'd probably just read the first one. Still, it was a great piece of writing to read, while trying to escape from reality and just imagine yourself being in a completely different environment, and I'd say overall, I quite enjoyed it, but I just wasn't satisfied.of Mercy Falls again some day, I'd probably just read the first one.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the trilogy. This is the last book in the series. The main characters are all young people but the book is well written and the plot well reasoned and not out of the realm of possibilities in today's political climate. The books are akin to George Orwell's, &#34;Animal Farm&#34; and &#34;1982&#34; and Ayn Rand's, &#34;Atlas Shrugged&#34;
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|More of my reviews can be found on my blog @   [...]    Let me start by saying that this year has been full of great reads and discovering new amazing authors. One of them was Colleen and her Slammed series. I'm beyond happy and ecstatic for her success and this is only the beginning of it. If you haven't read about Layken Cohen and Will Cooper, then you most certainly must! Now on to Hopeless. There're no words in this world to tell you how much I adored this devastating story. It's dark, edgy, magical and romantic. I loved every single second of it! Oh, and this book had the best. freaking. first. (non-)kiss. everrrr!!!    QUOTE  Being adopted isn't really a stigma I've ever had to overcome. I've never been embarrassed by it, ashamed of it, or felt the need to hide the fact. But the way Holder is looking at me right now, you would think I just told him I was born with a penis. He's staring at me uncomfortably and it makes me fidget. \\"What? You've never met anyone who was adopted?\\"    The plot. It sure does feel like a hopeless story the more the spine of the story cracks, but you cannot help but root for Sky as she discovers things about herself that one couldn't possibly begin to imagine. The story takes time to progress, but about 66% through, Colleen starts throwing these punches at you and you don't know how to protect yourself from them. I figured out some of the plot twists and had my doubts, but in the end, I was taken aback by its cruelness, brutality and darkness. I didn't think Colleen, always lovely and funny, had it in her, but I'm glad she chose to share Sky's story with the rest of the world.    The characters. Sky. Where in the world did this girl come from? Where did you hide her all this time, Colleen?? I felt for this broken girl who wasn't even aware that she had been taken into pieces in the first place. Now, with Holder, she's discovering the deepest secrets of her past, her soul and she doesn't know where to begin the healing process, becauseas soon as she begins to manage the drawbacks of the previous shocking reveal, another comes, completely out of nowhere, straight at her with a vengeance. And trust me these things were meaner than the queen bee in any high school! Which brings me to Breckin. I heart you!! Thank you, for keeping my girl safe and sound, painting a smile on her face when she needed it the most, being there for her.    Then we have Holder. Le sigh. I can assure you that Will is still my number one male lead that Colleen has created, but Holder sure made everything in his power to not be the runner-up. It wasn't a fair competition, because Point of Retreat is probably one of the top five books I have ever read. Ever!! However, Holder with his stunning persona, attractive looks *aaaahh, them dimples!!!!*, secrets and protective stance over Sky made me swoon like a crazy person, haha. I adore that even though the main focus was about Sky's growth and unlocking her past, we also got to see Holder develop as a person and heal some of his wounds that have hurt him for such a long time. (On a side note: I'm writing this review while my Dad is watching the 1/8 finals of European League in basketball and he is giving me evil glares, because I'm all giggles due to thinking about Holder).    QUOTE  \\"And once again in my new world full of heartache and lies, this hopeless boy somehow finds a way to make me smile.\\"    I wish I could quote the whole book to you, because every word was made of pure gold. It's a story you cannot put a price tag on, because it will haunt you for the longest time. The characters, especially Sky, are so easy to relate to and their sadness, happiness, goals and failures become a part of you in a way you wouldn't have imagined. I'm in awe of how beautiful, broken, dark and twisted this story is. I didn't expect anything from Colleen to be as good as her Slammed series, but this gives Slammed and Point of Retreat a run for their money. Whenever Sky felt like she couldn't breathe, I felt like the air was being knocked out of my lungs. She rarely cries, but when she did, I did too. Hopeless is enjoyable as well as devastating, but I wouldn't trade the minutes I spent on reading this book for anything. A definite recommend!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|This is the third book of a great trilogy. Keeps you wanting to read more. Hard to put it down!
B007ZCOT6C|1.0|More of my reviews can be found on my blog @   [...]    After reading \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" I couldn't get it out of my head and so I did some research in goodreads about similar books. There were loads of recommendations and I picked a few. At first I read the first book of Simone Elkeles' trilogy about three brothers (each book concentrates on a different one) called \\"Perfect Chemimstry\\".    Let's put it this way. The story was similar, but I wasn't sattisfied at all. It was just.. I don't even have the words to describe it. Alex's from Mexico or something and troughout the book he's living with his mom and two younger brothers. In USA. He's in somekind of a gang and if he wants to leave, he has to pay with his life. He's poor. Brittany, on the other hand, is the best student of the class, beautiful and is dating the most popular guy in school. Moreover, she's the cocaptain of the cheerleading squad. But.. Brittany's life isn't so glorious as it seems: her sister's disabled, basically not able to speak and retarded; her mom's got some kind of an anxiety disorder and her dad comes home just to sliip in his bed. Alex and Brittany are forced to work on a chemistry project and the boy makes a bet that he can get her physically and.. they fall in love. That's basically it.    All those chickitas and other Spanish expressions made me feel like I was watching a version of \\"Bring It On\\" starring Christina Milian or some kind of a Latin-American soap opera. Maybe it's my European and north origin, but all of those expressions just sounded too cheesy and fake. I couldn't even concentrate on the story, it bothered me that much. I would not recommend this book if you do not like soap operas and actually, it wouldn't have bothered me that much if it would've been more educating on the cultural side, but it wasn't, so, yeah. Didn't like it.    I'm 99% sure I'll not read neither of the following books, only when I'm bored to death (literally).
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Unbelievable! Never a dull moment, a great mystery. A keep you on the edge of your seatPage turner. A great read that will keep you guessing
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|My son asked me to get this game for him.<br /><br />He absolutely loves this game and thinks I am the coolest mom ever!!  Yay!
B0035XVVDY|5.0|A revenge fantasy that starts out with a rage inducing set of screnes that made me want to kill the suspect, the judge at least.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It's wonderful!!!! I've seen it four times on Broadway. On Tv, the 25th Anniversary! And now the movie. It's the best ever, there will never be anything like. Such a wonderful Musical !!!!
B0049J3QF4|5.0|It's just a feel good movie, with lots of entertainment for kids, nostalgia for adults, and lots of laughs. It's sentimental and laugh out loud funny. I love watching the background scenery, and characters. Love the Characters! Love small town America with all its hidden talents! Pixar nailed it. Way to go!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I read the books and loved them. The HBO series got good reviews so I thought I would check it out. I have only watched a few of the discs so far, but the movie stays pretty much to the story in the book and so far its very entertaining.
0525478817|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who is in need of a good read. It IS well written and easy to read.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|This had as much potential as any Tolkien episode, but suffers from intrusive music crammed into every nook and cranny, jarring and fast cinematography, and stagey exaggerated vocal delivery.  I prefer a calmer approach to mythology like \\"Krull\\" where the viewer is almost able to forget it's a movie and really soak in the mood and visuals.  Jackson constantly announces this is \\"action\\" with a capital \\"A.\\"
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is an awesome app. It's almost right everytime and it's even a little creepy! My mom got this on her andorid and I am glad to have it on kindle. You should really try it yourself! Now I'm gonna go play akinator some more.<br />K? Bibi!
B009YQJ322|5.0|They need to make a sequel! This movie was perfect. Didn't waste time on origin stories like so many other movies do. Loved it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this as much as the first book, eager to read the third and final portion! The books keep you entranced!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Another &#34;book club&#34; selection.....seriously?  This was not interesting, educational or of any value.  Then ending up asking for donations?  I just couldn't take him seriously.
1400052181|4.0|Those in the medical field will have a better appreciation for this book. Overall a great read for anybody interested in biographies.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This movie was all over the place. Couldn't tie it all in together. Expected more from this cast and crew.
1449415881|5.0|I buy one of these to put on my desk at work every year.  I also get one for my brother.  We can relate to many of the humorous cartoons.  It helps start every work day with a smile.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It is a refreshing change from other detective series.  Love the interaction between the two and how Sherlock is slowing warming up to Joan and liking her.
1608871452|5.0|I bought this for my daughter's birthday.  She loved it.  It had extra items included such as a map, postcards, and 4x6 photos of the leads.  It was new in November so it is fairly up-to-date.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a very intense series but it is very interesting for older tenns and also I would recommend this to any child over the age of 11.
1423113454|5.0|My grandson loves to read. He has been asking me to buy him this book since it was published. He was awarded the &#34;best reader&#34; award in his school. His principal said..it's no surprise to our school that my grandson has won the best reader award for his class. It's a must read for any library. A must have!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT APP WITH LOTS OF INFORMATION ON HOW LONG YOUR BATTERY WILL LAST FOR READING,SURFING THE INTERNET,GAMEING TEC.VERY PLEASE WITH THIS PURCHASE.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love Google search.  I use it more than any other search cause I always find what I'm looking for there.
0857680986|3.0|This is a good back to have as a figure reference in the art room. Somehow, the fact that the images are vintage looking make them less sexual.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|Good movie at a good price. I searched all around and found it to be priced the best on Amazon.com.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|A bit scary and walking through the lives of these people is like running a marathon. It is weirdly possible that this type of chemical warfare is possible even now.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|It's great for people who live in a place without the ocean or the severe weather . It's also a nice app because some people like to do yoga . There are people that have a disease that can cause them to not sleep it's called insomnia ,it's a fancy word for saying &quot;you can't sleep&quot;
B008QTV3X0|5.0|A bit scary, but I couldnt wait to see the next show, sometimes watching three in a row.  Very realistic (maybe a bit too relaistic), actors were amazing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome there is so many words that can describe it I love it at least. I personally think that everyone should have it.The only thing that I would change is that there is only two controls and I think that there should be a reverse switch. But other than that its awesome:))
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I bought this DVD to re-experience my memory of this movie.  I remember Robert Redford and Mia Farrow as being the two perfect people for these parts.  I watched the A&E version of the film, in which Mira Sorvino played &#34;Daisy&#34; almost as well as Mia Farrow, and it was good but not as good as the original.  I haven't seen the latest re-make with Leonardo Decaprio so I will reserve judgment.  Having said that Carey Mulligan has big shoes to fill.<br /><br />The original movie, I feel, captured the essence of what F. Scott Fitzgerald brought to life in his book.  It is a classic and I feel a person couldn't go wrong seeing this 1974 original even after seeing the 2013 re-make.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Terrific app. I purchase books thru amazon and allow borrow from public library. I have had no problems using this app.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am a history buff.  The book does make you wonder what might have happened if Kennedy had not been slain,
B00BC24NT4|5.0|As much as Le Carr&eacute; is known for his Cold War stories, he should be better known for his fine character portraits against hard-driving plots, no matter the century the story is set. Here we have a contemporary tale, and the murky extra-governmental terror-fighting-for-hire scenario swipes fast and deep. Some heroes, some dopes, some dupes, some damned bad guys, and some doughty British dames round out the cast. I wish I didn't finish it so quickly in order to savor the telling, but some of the twisty bits are worth a second read. Fans of the TV show Homeland would appreciate this indeed, as Le Carr&eacute; must be seen as the originator and thank Goodness one of the continuing perpetrators of excellent spy tales.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Read this book about 6 times if not more to my daughter every nite. And it never seems to bore me.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I'm not much on mysteries, but this one held my attention.  A modern day boy, missing his grandfather, went &#34;treasure hunting&#34;, not for money or jewels, but information about his grandfather's childhood.  Mystical, amusing @ times, unbelievable most of the time.  You mystery folks should love it!.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|If you  like comedy  and drama the show is for you.It is a spin-off of the jag series that was on a few years ago,and both shows show you how military law is enforced.It is so well written that the hour thier on passes on so quickly.
B00BQ1D7X4|1.0|As a life-long AIC fan, it really saddens me to see them attempt to produce \\"new work\\" when the end result comes off as a feeble attempt to re-create the glory days when Layne Staley was still alive. I'm not a fan of bands who lose the vocalist and replace them with someone similar who tries to imitate (directly or indirectly) the previous person's style or essence, and unfortunately this is exactly what has happened here. Nothing against William DuVall, but his ability/style seems like an attempt to sound exactly like Layne, which comes off as flat and bogus. For me, when I listen to BGWTB and this new album, I don't hear anything that identifies their notable sound. Their unique and easily identifiable sound is lost and gone and any creative edge that would capture the listener (me) or give them an original sound/movement that existed previously just simply is not there. In other words, Alice in Chains died with Layne's passing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton is such a fabulous show! I was hooked from the first episode and especially loved that the sinking of the Titanic played a role.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book. Enjoyed it very much. Read these two almost a year ago, but now that the third is out, I'm reading them again for a refresher.
B009B8YZIK|4.0|I enjoyed this film.  Effects are good, acting is pretty decent and the story is good.  It takes place in the Halo universe and follows a group of cadets around as they train.  I enjoyed it, you might if you like the Halo universe.  Just a solid showing for the first time out.
0345803485|1.0|Had to read this for book club.  Barely made it through.  Cannot believe this is what people are buying right now.  Leaves me feeling hopeless for our world.<br />Pure smut.  Trash.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is exciting like Fifty Shades of Grey, but without the sadist sex.  It is exciting to feel the passion come off of the page.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This story was cute. Personally, I don't like to describe the story as to not give away any details. I do want to say that sometimes you need a book that is light and easy and takes your mind off of the stresses of life. I think this book does a great job in that sense. Its airy, easy to follow, flows well, and does make sense. If you are looking for a book with an easy plot, this is your book! I hope you enjoy it :)
B0014JKJHK|1.0|I have had many pairs of Crocs before but these are not the same. I bought 2 pair fo work and Culinary School. They claim to be skid resistant but are not. I am sending back the second pair. Unfortunately, I have worn the first pair so I can't return them even though they split at the toe in less than a month!
B008G8SFGO|3.0|You have some winners and you have some losers. This one is right there in the middle. It's a decent effort, nothing really stands out though. Well, one thing stands out, but not in a good way. \\"Outta This World\\" by Tommy Thayer screams for four and a half minutes \\"Please accept me as the Spaceman.\\" Sorry boy, you will never be The Space Ace. Ok, ok, so I'm not a big fan of Tommy and Eric wearing Ace and Peter's makeup. But listen to Sonic Boom. Then listen to Monster. Hear the difference? Monster is definitely NOT a monster rock and roll album.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This product is outstanding.  It easily lasts me 4 or 5 charges for my Nexus 4 and I love the flashlight option too.  But what truly shines is their product support.  I had this product for about 5 months and I had a minor issue with one of the ports.  Sunnie (Anker Customer Support) sent out a new unit no questions as asked and continued to follow up to make sure I was happy with the result.  It is hard to find such a professional company that stands behind their products and they certainly do.  This thing charges my phones, Ipods and other media without any issues at all.  The 2AMP port is a huge bonus.<br /><br />Thanks Anker for your wonderful product and support!
B0050Q3TDY|4.0|Easy to use. I love all of the different types of jazz music, but I hate the commercial interruptions. Would prefer nonstop music.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|Nothing is better than the wall, but dark side is just great. Amazing period. You can listen to the whole thing without skipping any songs.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a long time! I usually don't watch movies like this but I seriously watched this one five times in a row, so sad but the way they display the husband/father is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!
030745455X|5.0|my husband read the triology absolutely loved it, recommended for female and male readers. the moveis do not not touch the novels. excellent...
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I noticed in this album that the energy is toned down to create melodramatic madness...but that is a good thing..this is indeed not a boring album but a really great masterpiece
073937771X|5.0|my husband read the triology absolutely loved it, recommended for female and male readers. the moveis do not not touch the novels. excellent...
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is a great game, long and with a good story line.  Well worth the price.  The hidden object games are just the right degree of difficulty.
0307454541|5.0|my husband read the triology absolutely loved it, recommended for female and male readers. the moveis do not not touch the novels. excellent...
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like the contrasts/colors on this calculator - It was a nice change from the plain one that I had
B00AAX68HG|5.0|pudding monsters is a wonderful game keeps my kids and me entertained all the time. It worked your mind the hole time makes you think. brain power.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I think it is riged so you spend money. I won't spend money, so I don't get Bingos. That all I have to say
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I bought this a month ago when my real sound machine stopped working and I don't regret it.  It was $3 and a new machine would have been at least $20.  Plus, this has so many more choices for sounds.  I tweak mine a little every night.  I do keep my Kindle Fire plugged in all night because it drains the battery otherwise.  I wish I would have waited, but I don't mind.  Worth every penny, but even better for free!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The details of the circus are brilliant but other than that I couldn't wait for this book to be over. Disappointed
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|I have read every Jack Reacher character books,  and was really looking forward to seeing, despite thinking that the Reacher character was incorrectly cast.  It was a very disappointing movie.  HUGE fan of the book series, however, and definitely worth the read...;o)
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|This movie was certainly not up to par for Denzel Washington!  It was simply a frustrating movie and I was very disappointed in it!
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|This movie was mostly depressing with only a couple of actual funny moments thrown in. And they went overboard trying to insert comedy where there wasn't any. It was entertaining enough to finish, but it was slightly painful.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A lively fast paced book about a place shrouded in mystery.  If one reads first person accounts of life in North Korea, such as Escape From Camp 14, one finds that details in this well researched book are in fact likely true even when they sound unbelievable!  A very good read!
B003M2DWE4|5.0|This very easy to use and nice, the snooze button is large and easy to use for kids.  The materials really makes it look like a Lego block.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Each song shows what a spectacular singer Amy Winehouse was before she became well known for her second album, Back to Black.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Loved the action and the store line. The acting was also good. The special effects were cool and lively.I will watch it again.
193700788X|5.0|If Charlaine Harris had to end the Sookie Stackhouse series. This was perfect ending. I have been reading Sookie Stackhouse books for a very long time, I call myself a pre-True Blood fan. I love the books. I have to admit that a couple of the books in this series have been a disappointment. But if you love Sookie Stackhouse and Charlaine's early work you will love this book. I never thought I would enjoy reading the last book. However, Charlaine stays true. It is fast paced and entertaining read. I was glued from the first page to the last one. Without any spoliers I will tell you that all of my lingering thoughts and questions about Eric, Sam, and Bill are solved and I am very happy with the ending.
B004GYY714|5.0|This might be the best App I've ever downloaded.  I like to leave it on while I go about my work. There are so many different genres and stations that I'm never bored.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great Trilogy to have on Blu Ray!  This modern version of the Batman series is awesome and the fact that all three movies came in one set was excellent.
0679805273|5.0|Purchased these items to give to our high school and college grads at church.  GREAT item at a good price shipped in a timely manner ... and the kids LOVED them ... THANK YOU!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|good story, swashbuckling traditional plot, with decent animation.  this is an entertaining movie with some content for kids and adults.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This is great calculator, it's got all I need. I like using this one more than my phone because it's bigger and the buttons are easier to touch/click.
B0094M2SCI|4.0|Not giving away the ending, this was an interesting plot with some good character development,and a predictable outcome.  The &#34;winners&#34; were telegraphed fairly soon in the story, and the montague/capulet sub-plot didn't really add much to the story.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|One of the classic game to play; UNO. It's such a great game. No loading issues for me, it's awesome that you also don't need to be online to play.
B00C3V5TTQ|5.0|This is the companion to &#34;Architecture and Morality&#34; and &#34;Dazzle Ships&#34;, even though it took a few decades to complete it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game was always addicting when I was going to the fair and what not. So, no surprise that this is just as addictive.<br />It loads and plays with no issue for me. No inter net needed to play.
B009MYARIK|2.0|Normally, loooove Sophie Kinsella's books.<br />Never got into this, never bought into the story line.  Wasn't a &#34;can't put down&#34;...more like, keep reading...there has to be humor in here somewhere!  Once!  I only laughed once, that Sophie Kinsella gut wrenching, picture it in your mind, tears in your eyes laugh.  Sorry, as a loyal reader of hers, she set the bar high...this one falls flat.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love this app!!! I currently have I think 13 different books at the moment. I've finally got a place to put my notes for my games like Fallout and Fable. I don't have to keep losing all the papers and looking for them all the time. I also have a place to put down my favorite lyrics to my favorite songs and not have to keep printing them cause I lose them. One other thing is I now have a place for my notes for Church. I LOVE THIS APP!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book has it all! First I love how's it's written though the man's eyes! Second, it's really freaking funny, and I am sure most of it is pretty true. (From the way a guy thinks.). Third it's sexy as hell!<br />This book is a double reader for me, that's how good this book is! Don't hesitate buying this book!  You won't be sorry!!
B006P4FBUE|5.0|This is a wonderful pastime since my piano is in a different state. It's at my Moms house cause it doesn't travel very well.
1481207474|4.0|I thought this book was very enjoyable. The banter was nice between the hero and heroine and the secondary characters added a nice richness to the story. Definitely a 4 star read. :)
B00004STDN|4.0|This was Stallone's comeback so to speak in the early 90's Stallone had done Rocky V which was a forgettable sequel Stop or my Mom will shoot. But Cliffhanger was a a good movie starring Sylvester Stallone as Mountain Rescue Climber Gabe Walker Jonathon Lithgow as Eric Qualen Micheal Rooker as Mountain Rescue Climber Hal Tucker Janine Turner as Jessie Deighan Michell Joyner as Sarah & Paul Winfield as Special Agent Walter Wright. Story you start off with Gabe, Hal & Sarah & Sarah is an inexperienced mountain climber while moving mountain top to helicopter Sarah's harness breaks Gabe tries to save her but is unsuccessful & she falls to her death Gabe leaves the Rocky Mountain area because of guilt. 8 months later he comes back to get his Girlfriend Jessie but she doesn't want to leave. Meanwhile there is a plane with millions of dollars on it when they do the plane to plane transfer (which is cool) 1 of the agents fight back the planes crash & they send out a distress signal. So Hal responds to the distress call Jessie tells Gabe he needs help she tells him to get over his fear of the mountain of course the rescue call was a fake these are your bad guys wanted criminal Eric Qualen need Hal & Gabe to find there money. So Gabe needs to get over his fear & guilt to survive. Later on Special Agent Walter Wright finds out that 1 of his agents is an inside man for Qualen so him & some agents go in to search for them. Admittedly it's not a perfect movie but I've hardly ever seen a flawless movie. Stallone isn't  like Rambo where he's just shootin' shootin' shootin' Lithgow was just so evil he was a good villain you want him to get  beat up  so bad he hides behind his henchmen he even tries to have a couple of kids killed. There are fights that are pretty gritty like when Stallone fights 1 of Qaulen's men in a cave & he has to kill him by impaling him on a huge icicle.  Lithgow  has the rememberable line kill a few the call you a murder kill a million they call you a conquergo figure. Or when they kill that old man Frank.There is the part where 1 Qualen's men who is a soccar fanatic kicks Tucker's head like a soccar ball. Hal has to do what he can to survive in this scene which I like his line when he kills that guy about the season being over. Before he kills his girlfriend HIS GIRLFRIEND! He says you know what true love is Sacrifice.  Micheal Rooker & Jenine Turner were the support & I liked how early on there's tension with Gabe & Hal after all Sarah was Hal's Girlfriend. The stunt work is great it wasn't any  CGI which is exactly what the remake will be. Yeah dumb @** Hollywood remaking a good action flick cause there's no originality left that's all this decade has been bad remake after bad remake with a huge drought of good action films. Renny Harlin gets hated on but for me if you have directed NOES 4 & Die Hard 2 then your a good director in my book. Sylvester Stallone did a good job. John Lithgow was great. Michael Rooker was good. Rex Linn was great it seemed like he enjoyed this role too much. Caroline Goodall was ok. Janine Turner was good. Ralph White was decent. Michelle Joyner I don't think has acted since this movie but her death is very rememberable. Paul Winfield was decent even though he didn't have much to do. If you haven't seen Cliffhanger see it anyway you can or if you haven't seen any of Slyvester Stallone's movies then make this 1 of the 1st.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story was fabulous. One second you're rooting for the cute couple...then you are hating him, then hating her, then loving her, feeling bad for him, hating them both. Each character has flaws, secrets, and major defects that they hid at the begining, then fester when they can't keep up the act.<br /><br />***************SPOILER BELOW**************<br /><br />Each twist and turn in the investigation look worse and worse for Nick, until it is clear that he wasn't involved. Amy is a carefully planned sociopath, and she plans so far ahead that it seems that there's no way that he could possibly look innocent. Nick finds a way to turn it around, clear his name, but cant seem to get rid of Amy. He hates her, but can't live without her. She has too much damning evidence of things he didn't even do.<br /><br />Don't download this if you're not prepared to stay up til 3am!

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book will definitely make you think.  I would have given it 4 stars if Flynn had of given me something to hold on to in the end, but nothing worthwhile.  The story of Amy and Nick is probably not that far fetched in this day and time of evil band crime, but I like living inside my head of peace and innocence.  If you want to be enthralled up to your ears for days reading their very interesting story just to have it end...with nothing to hold on to, then this book will do it for you!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very, very addictive. I love playing this version and the bridges version. Definitely worth downloading.  I only give 5 stars to games that I can't put down to do any thing at all.

B000IZ8SD8|5.0|This Star Trek movie for The Next Generation is like a Mix of The Original Series Movies: The Wrath of Khan and Voyage Home.

B005OYKI1I|5.0|It's clear that the appeal of these films is the fast cars and outrageous stunts, and damn do they deliver on that. Extremely well shot, well directed action scenes that get the heart pumping.<br />But at the center is a group of characters with surprising depth and development for films like this. You actually care about these people, so the tension rises even more during the excellent action sequences.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Clever imaginative writing, there is nothing better than a book which has you visualising as you read. All disbelief is suspended.
B009AMAGXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I have not read the book so I don't know the differences between the book and the movie. However, movies can't be exactly like the books. Screenwriters have the option to change a little or not depending on what they think will be a great movie. I will admit the movie was fast paced and a little sloppy. I feel they should have added a lot to it to make it better, but Overall I still enjoyed it. Everyone has different options about movies and we all can't like every movie we watch.<br /><br />I do recommend this movie and whether or not you will enjoy it will depend solely on you. It is a great story and way different from Twilight series.
B0098466CK|5.0|They actually really manage to live up to their other great albums. Keeping alive their very own groovy style of oldschool hard hero rock taken to a modern context. Keep it up guys, looking forward to seeing you at the Roskilde festival in Denmark, 2013!

B003QP4BJM|4.0|This is a superb book, in the tradition of Willie Ley, Richard Dawkins, and other great science writers. No matter what your scientific interests, it is a great and insightful read. I give it only four stars because it is inadequate and outdated on global warming. Now that we are in the 15th year of essentially zero warming, the book is unduly \\"namby pamby\\" in its assessment. As Matt Ridley himself said last winter in a Wall Street Journal column, the computer models are now conclusively proven false in their warming predictions for this century. Also, the UK Met has acknowledged that the empirical data show that there is no statistically significant warming since 1880 (see the Bishop Hill blog). And the competent literature on \\"extreme weather events\\" shows zero effects from global warming to date. In other words, there is now neither an empirical nor theoretical basis for asserting that anthropogenic global warming exists in detectible amounts or with detectible effects on the real world. Or, to be  slightly more precise, while all scientists agree that the greenhouse gas effect exists, no (as in ZERO) scientist has found that this theoretical effect has had a statistically significant measurable effect on global temperatures or climate outcomes in the last century. Since CO2 effects are nonlinear, that means future warming will be even less and even less measurable. That said, my own view is that there could be a measurable effect, but it is swamped by the cooling effects of solar and cosmic ray changes. It may well be the case, for example, that the only thing preventing (or slowing the arrival of) the next ice age (i.e., all of Canada covered by ice sheets) is human-caused CO2 emissions. These are the issues that a revised edition should discuss. Until it is published, we are left with a version that is flawed in its failure to nail this particular set of pessimistic superstitions to the wall.<br /><br />p.s. There have been a few other advances in other scientific fields that an update could profitably present.
B00A6TYCNQ|5.0|I would deffinetly suggests. people to play this game. all kinds of fighting and killing.nothing but tons of fun. it is for sure one of the best games ive played on the apps

B00CL50KDY|4.0|Imaginative, entertaining and even funny at times, this movie was quite well done.  It's worth a watch. I am told, for those that have read the book, it has a few details that have been changed, but generally stays true to the story in most  respects..
B007SGM084|5.0|Intense, erotic imagery, but very well crafted novels! Love them. I recommend reading them, even if you find yourself uncomfortable with the sexuality of the books. The plot is worth it.
159420411X|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book although I did not feel that it was as new as many think.<br /><br />There are some comments, I think I should warn any potential reader of this book.<br /><br />The first is that there is much about American sports in this book, if you do not know baseball, you will struggle in parts. Although if you keep going, I think you will find it rewarding. Some of his observations about how sportsman rarely did well after getting major publicity are valid for many sports.<br /><br />Furthermore, the writer is concentrating on many fields that at present we are struggling to predict. He actually bypasses many fields that we are rather good at predicting. For example, astronomers struggled to forecast the orbit of planets, today we can predict the path of planets. Another example would be bread sales in a modern city is reasonably predictable as is the sale of train tickets.<br /><br />Another point is that the writer stress Bayesian probability. Some of the problems he notes such as the importance of the initial probability that you use, which can cause many major differences in the result. Another problem that he does not mention is for Bayesian to work you generally need to know a lot about all the options. If your theory on one option is wrong, or you do not know one fact often it will fail. For example, if a coin is biased, and you want to measure how much biased it is, Bayesian can help, but if say there is a magnet, that can be turned on and off that affects the coin, and the statistician does not know about, Bayesian will generally fail. This is a big problem if you are dealing with competitive situations where players can and do change the rules like terrorism.<br /><br />Finally, I think the writer should edit his chapter on terrorism, after rereading his chapter on the stock market. Terrorism I agree with him is a publicity stunt. One event is not independent of another. If terrorists kills a few times ten people in an operations after awhile to get into the mass media,  a terrorist groups will have to kill twenty people. After they do that for a while, they need to kill thirty and so on. Another point is that as the terrorist gets experienced in killing ten, they are trained up to try something bigger. Israel by dealing forcefully with even small terrorist operations may be despite the writer's doubt be on to something. They definitely have the figures as the writer shows. The same would be true of theft. Most thieves start small, often they have a history of juvenile delinquency and as they get older advance to something bigger.<br /><br />Having said this, I do think that this book is worth reading, I intend to keep my copy to read again sometime.
B000SEI230|3.0|Very readable but sappy, predictable, and sophomoric. .  Not the author's best book. But if an easy read is what you need then this book might fill the bill.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|I have listened to Carole King for years.  This is my chill down music. Love it, love it, love it.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was a page turner.  There was always something new and interesting happening.  I give it five stars. I will read more of Colleen Hoover's books
B007FUMY8O|4.0|[[ASIN:1616551100 The Hound of the Baskervilles]] brings Sherlock Holmes to his closest encounter with the supernatural and because of this the novella works better than most Sherlock adventures. There are no vampires or ghosts, but a purported hound from hell measures out a good dose of horror. The novella is also one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most Gothic tales, set along the mores of England and in an ancient mansion that borders them. What we have is Doyle at his best and his excellent character Sherlock Holmes--who is derived from Edgar Allan Poe's Dupin as I pointed out in [[ASIN:1933747102 Edgar Allan Poe Annotated and Illustrated Entire Stories and Poems]]--does not disappoint with his sleuthing prowess, either. If Poe had written one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, this would have been it. A must read on a foggy night.
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|We enjoyed the movie with good action throughout but were disappointed a little after it ended.  It just did not end with much of a bang.

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Just when I thought I already had a great &#34;retro-shooter&#34; to satiate my needs for getting nostalgic on the go... here is one I can't do without! I still Love Voxel Invaders... But, I find myself playing this one way more often - and not just because &#34;I just got it&#34;. The replay factor is higher for some reason. I suppose it is the different options for game-play:<br />-Conquest<br />-Hardcore<br />-Survival<br />Plus, it feels &#34;faster paced&#34; with more room for error and destructive eye-candy galore.<br />Also, there are 3 different ways to control the ship! All of which are pretty neat depending on individual style/taste/mood.<br />As far as the game goes, you start right off the bat with a retro-asteroids-type environment. Getting power-ups to enhance your shot (among other neat add-ons) not to mention different types of shield (one that actually inflicts damage!)<br />The waves upon waves of enemies is extremely cool & feels like will never get boring.<br />Eye-Catching Visuals? Check!<br />Fast-paced action? Check!<br />Challenging Bosses? Check!<br />Although it was a &#34;free app of the day&#34; - I would've gladly payed the $1.99 if I had known how great this game was.

B00821PCJS|5.0|It's rare that you find a sci-fi show on television especially these days when the masses are watching cheap reality programming. It is even rarer still to find a sci-fi show that is actually good and worth watching rather than the usual velveeta cheese fare. I really enjoy this show and look forward to watching the second season.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This review contains NO spoilers. I love the Walking Dead. I have seen every episode chronologically, so I can give a well-informed opinion about the show. This season, as the title says, is not the best. I did enjoy it, however, despite the shortcomings. The shortcomings in no way make this season mediocre! Don't skip out on it, just be aware that there are a few episodes in the middle of the season that are superfluous. I like to refer to these as &#34;fluff.&#34; You don't really need them in there, but they're in there anyway, being fluffy. One of the main writers quit, so naturally the show paid a little bit of a price. It happens. Overall, the season started strong and it finished strong. That's what's most important, and it is certainly worth watching.
0307887448|3.0|This book was an entertaining read but a very difficult one to immerse oneself in. I kept on finding myself being drawn out of the story due to how inconsequential the threat actually feels. We are given an evil corporation that feels like a Hana Barbara villain who is twirling his mustache and laughing maniacally. Even with the bad guy being this evil, you never get the feeling that he is a threat as the main character is a superhuman with no faults.<br /><br />The main character at first seemed to be an interesting character but quickly lost that aspect as he was shown to know everything about nearly everything. Not only has he had time to read every author that the idol has liked, he has memorized and beaten every arcade game to the kill screen, watched many movies to the point of memorizing all their dialog , and knows all the music and when it was released. Did i mention that he was a teenager? also, did I mention that he was in school? well I don't know about you but I found that to be an immediate blockade to immersion. take the time and add up how long it would have taken him to master every one of these games, read all these books, watch all these movies (some up to 157 times) and memorize the music of the era while still going to school and being under 18 years old. now recall that they mentioned that this egg hunt didn't start until five years previously.<br /><br />this came across as ludicrous to me as I don't see how that is possible. Another part of this that I found irritating was giving the main character the ability to become a master hacker when he is required to have those skills. There is one point in the book when he is required to hack into a system and needs passwords to get around, but luckily he bought those passwords in an auction a while ago just in case he ever needed them. This felt incredibly contrived and insulting to the reader.<br /><br />He is a character that has no true faults and you never worry about him. you already know the outcome of the book and never once feel any true sense of terror that he might fail. He is even given a Deus Ex Machina device that takes any tension truly away.<br /><br />One other fault that bugged me to no end was the implication that the five main good guys were the only intelligent people on the planet while everyone else were complete morons. I'm sorry but that felt like a slap in the face. The evil corporation was already pointed out to have hired some of the best talent out there and had a whole army of intelligence officers working around the clock to find the egg. There were clans who got together to find the egg. Logic would dictate that the fist gate and even the second would have been found a lot faster than five years. All of these people never even get near the gate or key or decipher the clues until our main heroes solve the problem. I don't buy that for a second, a teenager is not going to be one step ahead of every single hunter out there after five years of searching.<br /><br />Even with all these negative reactions, the book is still a page turner and can keep you reading well past a reasonable bed time. The nostalgia is fun but could have been handled better. It would have been more intense if the character was flawed and the good guys had to pool their knowledge collectively to work towards the end goal. Having the bad guys be so one dimensionally evil prevented them from being truly a threat. if there were dressed and named like normal avatars then they could have been more frightening as they could have easily infiltrated the ranks of the good guys and you would never know who to trust.<br /><br />If you want a fun book to read then this is worth the time as it is fast and shows that the author has promise for his future efforts. Be warned that the book doesn't hold up under a lot of scrutiny and probably won't be worth re-reading multiple times. I don't think it deserves a five star rating but i don't think it deserves less than a three star so I am giving it a three out of five.r so I am giving it a three out of five.
B00AALHW6Y|4.0|Darius Rucker makes me forget that I am not a big fan of country music. I don't hate country music; I just like it in small doses. But Darius has changed all that. I could listen to this guy all day. It's not the music, but his voice that I am addicted to. If you don't know who Darius Rucker is, he was the frontman for Hootie And The Blowfish. After Hootie, he put out a solo R&B album that was a masterpiece. Then he decided that the right genre for him was country music. Wait a minute...a black country artist!!!! Charlie Pride's the only one who's been able to pull that off. Well, move over Charlie. Darius Rucker has arrived and he's the real deal. If, after two great country albums, you're still not sure, listen to his third and you will become a \\"True Believer\\".

1451695195|5.0|As someone who has read somewhat similar narratives to the key issues touched on in this book, I found it confirming but still amazing. The book is well written and I finished it in one sitting, which is unusual for me. It is also revealing on a personal level, so the book has many dimensions.<br />There are many things we don't understand like dark matter or the many complexities of the brain. Some proven elements of Quantum Mechanics are truly stranger then fiction. There is no reason to reflexively disbelieve eyewitness accounts even though they can conceivably be attributed to medical issues. Especially when these accounts have more plausible answers to life's oddities then science does. How can one take a position that \\"it's impossible\\" without proof?<br />Is it reasonable to postulate that someone would make claims in a book that can easily be disproven? The medical records and substantial staff both on and off site, including experts in infectious diseases who were consulted, could easily have proven this a hoax. It's unlikely that an author would take a risk that all these individuals would remain silent. I also don't think that Dr. Wade would jeopardize his reputation by authenticating Dr. Alexander's highly unusual medical situation even if he is his neighbor.

Even the hanging victims hanging in place was like synchronized swimming...&#34;now everyone move your feet like you are on a treadmill&#34;.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I should have known better than to waste my time (and money) reading the final installment of this series after combing through the reviews.  Everything about this book seemed wrong.  The characters personalities seemed different, the plot line was confusing, and even the writing seemed off.  What was the whole point of the tall man and medium man thing?  At one point there was a round man too I think?  Way to blow me away with some super plain adjectives.  Was that aspect supposed to be suspenseful?  Mostly it was annoying and weird. Most of all, Sam?  Really?  Sam?  The guy who has been stuck in the friend zone the entire series is now the love of Sookie's life?  I find it completely hard to believe that Sookie (and the ever resourceful, Eric) would give up on her relationship with Eric.  This book is full of stupid nonsense that doesn't add up.  I can't even believe this book made it to print.

I feel like I just bought a car from a used car lot.  Except after I get a car from the lot, it comes with tires.  If the lot was run by Mobile Systems, Inc., I'd be lucky if it came with an engine.<br /><br />Unfortunately I can not rate zero stars, so 1 will have to do.

Her rearrangement of some songs that I was unable make out the words, was refreshing to hear.  Her voice is melodic yet with a presence that is hard for me to explain.  Just a wonderful album from someone who is no longer alive.

B00514HDNW|3.0|Although the story was a decent tale and gave some aspects into the descent into extreme loneliness. It jumped around many times in the tale and as soon as there was structure and sanity to the story it was over. Many times I was overwhelmed with what was happening and whether I was reading the past or present.<br /><br />I regret buying it. I recommend borrowing it. It only takes a few hours to read.
B0026SCMNM|3.0|This tale of a young Irish woman emigrating to Brooklyn in the post WWII era seems pale compared with Toibin's other books, notably The Master.  The main character is so passively dishonest with virtually everyone she interacts with I became indifferent to how the story turned out.  What was the author's point?  Was it something about Irish culture?
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|A great finish to the trilogy and a good look into the views of women and their plight. Also the in depth look at sapo gives you some idea of how easy an arm of the government can keep things covered up. If you read all three books you can't help to pull for lisbeth and her advocate bloomkist.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I managed to see this movie in the theaters before I had too much spoiled. I knew the names of all of the principal actors in the film and the names of the characters they were portraying, but I had done a pretty good job of shielding myself from articles containing discussions of the plot. As such, I found the film to be very entertaining and fun, and there were a couple of surprises. I will admit that a lot of the movie was predictable. In some ways, too predictable. While attempting to stay true to some historic Star Trek stories and fan favorite moments, the movie was - in some small ways - lessened. Still, there was action, aplenty, and the special effects department got everything right. The cast is just about perfect. This time around, there seemed to be a lot more cohesion and interplay between the members of the main cast, and every principal character had plenty of time in the sun and saved the day in their own way. The dialogue was 95% great. There were a few points at which I was thinking to myself \\"Did they have to make it sooooo close to previous Trek movie dialogue?\\" Still, most of the dialogue was witty and true to character, and the actors did a great job with it. I think they all had a lot of fun with this movie. I was especially impressed with how much more I like John Cho's Sulu characterization this time around. Benedict Cumberbatch played an AMAZING villain that you both cheer for and against. I'm sure he will have a promising future post-Star Trek.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie, even if it had a few too many points where it tread on ground that's been trod before. J.J. Abrams continues to impress me with nearly everything he directs and produces. I don't know if he'll be able to work on another Trek film now that he's got the dream job of directing Star Wars movies, but one can only hope he can squeeze at least one more in!

B007KQ6XYY|4.0|What I don't get is after the game is finished, it says new levels come soon and it said no new levels coming soon so, why did they say coming soon?(either way is would rate this 4 1/2)
B007BFSYMS|4.0|The Pay version came up as the free app of the day, so I replaced the Free version.<br />It has a couple of odd things is does like dimming the contrast and not the brightness so the whole screen is glowing gray with a super dim clock. But other than the couple odd things it does, it is a great piece of work. The Sounds loop flawlessly, and you can add more, even from other programs. Their site has lots to download.  I do like that I don't have to use the clock portion of the program and am able to use another Alarm Clock app which I like but has a looping problem and limited sounds.
B009LT1YZ6|1.0|This game is perhaps too relaxing.  If you like action, this isn't the one for you....what a sleeper!<br />I deleted it....

B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is one of those stories that really makes you ponder your existence.  I found it fascinating.  Answering the eternal question is a bit of a scary thought.  This book puts some of that into perspective.  It is worth the read.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|this book allowed me a glimps into a war that has shaped the American cultural  and political landscape for over a decade.  Mr.  Kyle  spoke to his readers like he would a friend and that tone allowed us into his violent and bittersweet world. I learned about the brotherhood of the seal teams and about the character of this American hero.  my only wish  is that he was still alive to share more of his experiences and  educate as many people as he could about what our military is really about and the tremendous level of character these men and women display.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Thought it was going to be total cheese, but it was the right amount of cheese and humor and action

B005K01VZS|5.0|This is my favorite Albom book that I have read.  His thoughts on community, faith and fellowship are beautiful and though provoking.  What a wonderful wonderful book.  Albom is also very honest about his thoughts, not all of which are flattering.  Highly recommended!
B00C061I3K|5.0|I just finished listening to \\"Random Access Memories\\" and wow - this is a timeless masterpiece. This album is not for the fist-pumping, mainstream-loving crowd but rather for the audiophiles. Daft Punk used real drums, a real orchestra, and plenty of complex instrumentation that only the sound engineers know about to pull off what has become a rarity in today's music scene - deep and meaningful melodies that thrive on the patience of the listener.<br /><br />Daft Punk has always been known for releasing electronic dance music, otherwise known as EDM, even when it was not popular in the United States. But now that pop music in the US is all about fist pumping and is largely technologically influenced, it is starting to live up to its stereotype of all sounding the same. So Daft Punk, being the rebels that they are, decided to release a retro-influenced album that used a real orchestra with live instrumentation to make a statement about how artists are forgetting to make music for the ears rather than for the next radio hit.<br /><br />This release is much more than just an ordinary album release. This release makes a huge statement about how EDM can go wrong if artists rely too heavily on technology and not enough on creativity. At a time when mainstream is obsessed with putting out quick club hits, Daft Punk took us way back into the world of disco with little regard for how the mainstream crowd would react. The result being thirteen tracks of a mixture between analog recordings and technologically influenced synth riffs. It would be no surprise if many folks did not like the new material - but can you blame a populous whose ears have been ruined by mainstream radio?<br /><br />I can honestly say I do not have a favorite track because it changes depending on what I am listening to at the time.<br /><br />Do your ears a FAVOR and order a PHYSICAL copy of this album because an MP3 version will rob your ears of amazing audio quality.
B007MB5OCE|1.0|Starts out great.  Interesting.  Original.  And then I noticed that every death in the book was played for laughs or at best indifference.  And I didn't like that.  It made it hard to like the main character and the author.  Not as good as it seems.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was such a great adventure. If you are one off those people who like adventure, action, and romance this book is great for you
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|I was shocked but pleased to see that Willie had a new album. I pre ordered this for my husband's birthday, as Willie Nelson is his favorite musician. I haven't heard the whole album yet, but what I heard is great. My husband is enjoying it. Props to the old dude for continuing his musical career!
B00BV2M9LO|1.0|I am still trying to finish this book. An intriguing story almost derailed by the level of writing you would expect from high schoolers. I have not read anything by Preston and I now suspect I won't if the prose in this book is any indication of his writing ability. All the characters are stereotypically one dimensional and are all petty squabbling idealists. When they begin to die I damn near cheered. Majorly disappointed.

B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|I LOVE this movie, however, we were able to watch about 95% of the 3D disc without our glasses on, because it was in 2D. Not sure if this is because the technology of 3D tv's just isn't up to par yet, or if there's an issue with how they're producing 3D on the discs, but if you're buying this version for the 3D, just be warned that the 3D experience is nothing like a theatrical 3D experience.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It wound things up neatly. I saw a lot of negative reviews, I didn't think it was that bad, more anticlimactic after all the drama of other books.<br /><br />  *********SPOILER ALERT***********<br /><br />  She kind of had to end up with Sam. The only way she could be happy with a vampire is if they turned her, and that wouldn't be her thing. She had always had chemistry with Sam, and loved him, even as a friend. What other man was there hanging around? Eric would have never let her go if not forced, and in the end he tried to protect her- even if his motives were unclear.so, anticlimactic, but it fit, really.

B00C90T4QK|5.0|I can't lie and say I am not a big Michael Bublé fan, this latest album is one of his greats that he shows good versatility and soulful tunes from really poppy to smooth and sloe...he has good command over his voice and it show as it moves from You Make Me Feel So Young to To Be Loved to the last track \\"Young At Heart\\".
B003VANOFY|1.0|The headset seemed like a serious luxury at first. I've had it for about a month before things started going (unforgivably)wrong.<br />When I first got it, I could not get the driver to install correctly. There were a lot of forum threads with this same issue. I'm not sure if its because I have the logitech gamepad also, and it was causing conflict or what, but it CONSTANTLY alerted me that I needed to unplug and replug the headset device. It was to the point where it would have up to 7 stacked alerts on top of one another, and no matter how many times I clicked OK and did as it requested, it never failed to repop again.<br />Then there is the problem of disconnects. Its a seriously frequent thing. It used to only do it when I was really far away from the computer (I like to listen to not so child friendly comedy while I do chores around the house). But now I can be sitting less than 2 feet away from the hub and it is constantly connecting, disconnecting, connecting, disconnecting. I find myself tilting my head and leaning over in useless attempts at getting the stupid thing to stay connected. It does this EVEN WITH the charger plugged in. I had thought oh hey, even if the wireless is screwy, atleast I can use it later with the cord plugged in, WRONG. For anyone who PvPs in games, this is a very, very serious problem to miss 2-5 second blips of conversation multiple times per minute.<br />So today, it absolutely refused to connect to the computer at all. Fully charged, plugged in, no connection. I tried rebooting, nada. So, I got out the handy little installation CD it came with and choose \\"Repair.\\" This seemed to be going well until the last fifth of the repair process, and then the entire computer froze and crashed. After I rebooted I loaded up vent to let my teammates know I was going to be longer still trying to tinker with this ridiculous headset, only to learn that my entire vent address file is corrupted, all my server addresses and passwords... gone. Its as if its never been used before. Skype acts like its never been used before as well, requesting setup, but thank god the information is stored on their server and not my computer. Enter nerd rage. I don't know what extent my data loss is, this is just what I've found thus far to be a problem, and it made me angry enough to get on Amazon to write a review to let others know about it. Is it a nice headset? yes, it feels great, comfortable, sound is awesome. Does it come with obstacles? Bet your dollar on it.<br />I wish I'd stuck with my cheapy headset that I have to replace every 2 months instead of losing all that information.<br />Editing to add that all my game pad key assignments are also gone.if its never been used before.

B005LAII4E|4.0|Coming from a long time fan who grew up watching the original GI Joe cartoon, GI Joe Retaliation is definitely better than Rise of Cobra.<br /><br />PROS:  It's a lot more authentic in weaponry and costumes.  Cobra Commander actually looks like Cobra Commander.  Snake Eyes lost that mouth he had in Rise of Cobra that made him look like a Power Ranger.  The Joe cast overall is better and a lot more believable as a top special forces unit.  Gone is the over-the-top high tech gadgetry from Rise of Cobra, replaced with more recognizable gear from the cartoon.  The action as a result is a lot better and overall just a lot more well done.  Bruce Willis and the Rock add some needed star power and some good laughs as well.<br /><br />CON:  The one big beef with Retaliation is the handling of the plot.  I won't spoil it, but fact is, they goofed it a bit.  They were going for dark, but the timing and method were just off leaving more of a \\"this movie is now missing something\\" feel vs an authentic dark and dangerous mood.  If you've read any of the other reviews or read about the reasons this was delayed a year (involving their handling of a certain star's character in the film), then you know what I'm talking about.  Had this not been the case, Retaliation might have at least been in the conversation for best action film of the year.  Instead, it will be considered good, but not great.<br /><br />Personally, I only dock it one star for the CON.  GI Joe is something you go see for good action and a lot of it.  In that, Retaliation does not disappoint and is better than Rise of Cobra.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series.<br />The costumes, the acting, the story line are all first rate.  I have loved all 3 seasons and can't wait for season 4.
193700788X|5.0|No spoilers.<br /><br />I felt Charlaine Harris remained true to the series and Sookie and felt the ending was pretty much the only way it could have ended.  I have read every book multiple times and listened to them on on audiobook  many, many times.<br /><br />What I think people need to keep in mind is that this is a urban fantasy series not a paranormal romance.  One of things I have enjoyed the most is the reoccurring secondary characters which has made Sookie's world much richer for me.  For True Blood lovers who started with the show first, you can not compare the two.  They are so loosely connected that they are really two separate entities, so don't read the books expecting the same, then complain about the differences.<br /><br />I was not thrilled with the prologue and think the elements it provides could have been written into the story another way, but it was short, provided needed info and Harris wanted to do something different.  So what? Why say it was written by someone else?!?<br /><br />I enjoyed the story and getting caught up with all the characters, many of whom are given a sort of \\"ending\\" to their mini stories.  For those not happy with Sookie's and the other endings, really, did you expect Harris to write several pages of Jason and Michelle married, had 4 children, 2 boys and 2 girls, one named Sookie.  Jason continued to work for the township and they died peacefully at 75.  Jane Bodehouse continued to live with her son and drink at Merlotte's until dying of cirrhosis at 60.?  Sookie's story goes on, Harris will just not be writing it but she did provide some type of closure ensuring that Bon Temps and it's people go on.<br /><br />As for what happens to Sookie in the end, if you've read every book and have listened to what she said (and is repeated so clearly in this book), it was the only true to Sookie possible ending.  So you loved this character, or that character and this one did that, blah, blah, blah and Sookie was so blah, blah, blah.  They are written like real people with FLAWS.  Sookie stayed true to herself with her choices, no matter how some of the haters wanted her to choose someone else.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book for the reason I've enjoyed all the rest in the series:  a great cast of flawed characters, a little action and a human heroine who isn't really an a$$kicker, but rises to the occasion to save the ones she cares about.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the whole series.  The acting, the costumes and the story line are riveting. Very disappointed that Matthew dies though.<br />VERY<br />DISAPPOINTED

B0070UFMOW|2.0|The Fiio e17 is the second Fiio product I have owned - or perhaps should say have attempted to own, for literally every Fiio amp I've bought has broken after only a short period of use.  My story: like many Fiio customers I was new to high-end audio, and the e11 thus seemed like a perfect entry level amp to power my then-new Ultrasone Pro 900s.  Affordable, easy to use, and packing enough of a punch to get you started.  Well power my cans that little amp did, and I was in audio heaven until the thing broke, less than two months after I had purchased it.  What happened specifically was that the jack malfunctioned, a problem that would unfortunately for me become recurrent.<br /><br />Now, the warranty lasts 1 year, so no issues there, even though the return process is typically a pain.  I thought about exchanging my broken 11 for a not-broken 11, but decided instead that I would wait for the (then) new and hot 17 to become available (it being very hard to find in its first few months of release).  I eventually got my hands on one, and was thrilled with the product I received.  Indeed, the 17s design is sleek and its controls intuitive, and the sound it provided was noticeably better than the 11 it had replaced, at least when powering my particular cans.  Things went well for about 6 months, until - once again - the jack broke.  In the exact same way.  Bummer, no music for a good period, which for me is just tragic.  OK, so I exchanged it for a new one, which worked for a little while before breaking again ... you got it, in the exact same way.  That's a shame, for after doing some investigating online it seems that the consensus on Fiio products is that they are affordable for a reason, and although they absolutely deliver on performance they are rather shoddily made.  Well that's that, I'm getting out of the Fiio game for good.  Even when under warranty, having to go back to my in ear buds while waiting for a new unit is just too much to take.<br /><br />Now let mebe clear: I don't dispute any aspect of the other reviews on here praising the 17s sound.  Nevertheless, the thing is - at least from my experience - a hunk of junk.  Anyway, I have put in an order for a made-in-America Schiit Modi and Magni combo, so we will see how that goes.  I have high hopes.  Best of luck fellow audiophiles, hope my experience isn't too typical.
