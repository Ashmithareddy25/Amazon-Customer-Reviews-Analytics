1476712042|5.0|I have to say, I read the reviews before I read the book, and was on the fence about reading it! I am glad I did! A lot of the reviews were negative because he is so damaged and she needed to get out of it and so on, and so on....Yes he is damaged, but that is why we have a heroine to help him get over this! I struggled with them and each of their fight, I honestly found myself being upset because I had to stop reading where they were going thru a tough time, and I was in a bad mood until I got to start reading again - yes, I was up until 2 a.m. trying to finish the book while I had to get up at 6 a.m. to go to work! I felt for them - I think my only complaint would be that they are under 21! I know the under-age aspect is worked into the plot several times, but I am not a big fan of teenage characters - maturity is always a plus. Despite that, I truly did enjoy the book!
0767817664|5.0|This film is over looked and recently was redone, poorly.  This one is classic and captures the 80s style.  There are several cheesy effects but the overall composure of the entire film is excellent.  The best scene is the one with a very young and pretty Amanda Bearse (her first role) being seduced by the vampire (Sarandon) in a Disco.  The lighting and scene is to die for.  Roddy McDowall also never really got credit for this role properly.  His role is very well done.  And some of the lines are quite funny.  It mixes horror and comedy in the best possible ways.  Rent it and see.  Colin Farrell is cute but could never play the kind of character as well as Chris Sarandon did in this version.  Finally the role of Charlie is much better portrayed by William Ragsdale , very sexy and attractive I must say.  Again this film and many actors were over looked at that time.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Finally got around to giving the new Aerosmith album my undivided attention last nite.I can't believe all the negative things that are being said about this record. Having been a fan of theirs since 1st album I can say this is their best album since \\"Pump\\",maybe even better.This record has everything a rock fan could want,especially for a band thats been in the game as long as they have.I'd like to see the Stones put out an album of new material this good,instead of the way overpriced 3cd \\"Grrr\\". This album has rockers, ballads and a couple country tinged songs.I even like the Carrie Underwood duet about 50 times better than I thought I would.She brings a certain type of uncharacteristic sleaze to her vocals that I really liked.Great guitars!Great drumming!Very entertaining album!
B001BR5NH6|4.0|Kelly LeBrock is gorgeous and portrays the character so well.  The two boys are geeky and easy to relate to.  One is simple and not that cute while the other looks fabulous in girl's panties.  Funny how the dark haired boy never pursued his acting career.  Maybe he had other interests.  The best part about the film is the comedy factor which has points throughout (SPOILER ALERT: Lisa--Kelly LeBrock turns Chet--Bill Paxton into a large pile of crap and threatens to give him a set of Elephant Balls).  A lot of funny parts and classic lines to recall with friends. It is extremely John Hughes and shows.  All of his work was quite memorable.  I also highly recommend this film with some equally great acting and dialog: [[ASIN:B0011EQBOS WarGames]]
B004O3YGMC|5.0|After trying all sorts of ways to get a browser with flash on my Kindle Fire 2 and  actually getting Adobe Flash to install (Which would not open)I came across this app and figured I would give it a try, if it didn't work, well, it was only five bucks. I am so happy I tried it because now I can access my home computers desktop from anywhere in my house from my Kindle.. I can do anything that I would do on my computer, on my Kindle. The biggest reason I love this app is because I can play all my games I love on Facebook as where using the Silk browser I could not. Defiantly recommend this app if you want to be able to do the things you would normally do sitting at your computer but don't feel like sitting at your desk..
B0058A119G|5.0|One of the best in my collection.This song  has been sung by many wonderful artist.I think this is the best of Alan and Marilyn Bergman's talent and the lyrics are beautiful.Streisand is at her best with this one. Actually the CD is totally intertaining and Good Cozy Stuff here; David Boyd has this from Amazon where I get all my CD'S .If you want selection---Amazon is the place.

B009P5S11G|5.0|I've been a fan of Rihanna ever since Rated R, I have all 6 of her previous albums but this one by far, I must say is Rihanna's best album to date. This album is so edgy, so many eclectic sounds, I applaud Rihanna's creative direction on this album, it's so different than anything she's ever done. \\"Unapologetic\\" conveys every human emotion, it makes you wanna dance, it make you wanna cry, it relaxing & soothing to the ear but overall it gives you happiness. Rihanna has grown into a strong confident young woman this album reflects where she is as a woman & where she's going, every song gives you a different side of Rihanna Sassy,Sophisticated,Rounchy,Fun,Vulnerable and most importantly \\"Unapologetic\\".This album is mix of all 6 of Rihanna's previous albums but with a rawer edgier twist,more current but yet ahead of it's time job well done Rihanna, you've won me over again.

B000JML90Y|5.0|This book is truly required reading for any biology teacher, but for students in high school it may be a bit yet trying. I would recommend Ernst Mayr for AP or anything by Sean Carroll for something more accessible and up to date for students, and leave this as an important piece of science history.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A real page turner, with unexpected twists and turns.the ending is realistic, if not a little depressing. The characters are well developed.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|another great book by mr king. love it love it. this compares to dolores claiborn, it makes you stop and think.
B008458O3S|5.0|This game really is a marvel of logic and ingenuity.  The early levels are simple, but become challenging in short order.  Some of the later puzzles took hours for me to solve.  This is unlike anything I have seen before, and would be a bargain at twice the price.

B005KELWJY|5.0|I chose this product because it was the right size. I will recommend to anyone who has a kindle. Nothing to dislike
0525953728|5.0|Overall I felt this was a great book. It's not the best written book with the biggest words, or most vivid detail etc. but it does what was intended for which is entertain. I thoroughly enjoyed the intense action and fast paced to the point writing and could read it for an hour without even realizing how much time had passed. If you want an action packed to the point book without a lot of the other filler then this is for you.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Fast moving and gripping. Good rainy Saturday afternoon read which was most enjoyable. Another Jack Reacher saga which I could not put down.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B00A8IO7DA Ab Shortcut System]], I think I have some authority on fat loss and getting a lean body. So I can tell you without a doubt that 'Why We Get Fat' will answer every question you've had on how to lose that weight you've been holding on to.<br /><br />So here's what the author does best: This book doesn't simply give you another 'weight loss diet'. It presents a whole new way to look at food and how it reacts with your body.<br /><br />The idea presented here is that a high carb diet (the standard western diet) is not what humans are adapted for. We simply do better on a high FAT diet (eating 'fat' does not equate to GETTING fat, as many diets suggest).<br /><br />It's no surprise to see this book so highly recommended. I'd suggest anyone with a weight problem pick it up. It's an easy ready and unlike the name may suggest, you don't need to be a scientist to get through it. Everything is broken down clearly.
B008MM9630|5.0|I enjoy this game.  I love the challenges and the farming.  It doesn't freezes up on me like some of my other games.  Great game

0785163174|3.0|Let me just tell you straight up the story was alright. I didn't hate it, but I really didn't \\"LOVE\\" it. The story becomes way too predictable for no reason except until the very very end. I also didn't like how some fights turned out. The cave fight was so anticlimactic that I was just flabbergasted. However, this story DID have a sense of epic-ness to it just like any other huge events. It was weird and interesting to read how the Avengers were clueless about the Phoenix when it was such a big event in the x-men. Blah, enough about the story. Let's get started on the art.<br /><br />The first few issues were painfully hard to read, because of the art. I mean, come on... the eyes are not even properly drawn and the faces look \\"weird.\\" They don't look like themselves. Hope looked like a dude with a wig on. Did they run out of money in the art division and had to hire the most average artist they knew? After every issue, I prayed to the Marvel gods that it would be a different artist, but sad to say it didn't come true until way later. Reading the first 5 issues felt like going into a 5 star restaurant and ordering the best burger they had, but ended up tasting like a McDouble from McDonalds. The only reason that this got my 3 star is because of Oliver Coipel. It was a joy turning every page and seeing this beautiful characters drawn perfectly compared to the crappy first 5 issues. I didn't realize how much I loved his art until I had to go through that crap. It made me appreciate his work even more.<br /><br />Overall, this book could have been WAY better if Oliver Coipel just took over all the issues. I would have gave it 4 or maybe even 5 (I may have enjoyed the story a little bit more). I was thinking about giving it 2 stars, but I had to stop myself and re-read the Oliver Coipel issues to bring myself to click up to 3 of them. As a visual medium, I don't know how Marvel even allowed the first five issues to go out.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I am glad I took the time to read this classic! It was well-written and gave insight into Victorian ideals. A note of warning to modern horror enthusiasts: If you are looking for a gory slasher tale - this book will disappoint. I might also add that the only video version of Dracula that comes closest to this book is the BBC's 1977 version of Dracula.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I was wondering if the book contains pictures and/or graphs?  If so, do they show up well in the Kindle version?  I have had negative experiences in the past where the graphs in the book were so tiny that they were indecipherable without a magnifying glass, and regretted not getting the traditional book version.  [To the author] Mike: your responsiveness to everyone, your openness, and your \\"intellectual humility\\" about the subject matter make you seem like a very trustworthy guy.  This factors highly in my decision to get your book.  Thanks!

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I purchased this edition of Prometheus because I wanted the bonus material. As a huge Alien fan, I very much enjoyed this movie in the theaters and wanted to get answers to my questions.  I liked the voice overs during the bonus material.  I even downloaded the Prometheus app to my phone and found it cool that I could interact with it from my phone.  My only complaint is why did I have to pay for the 3D and regular DVD versions?  I guess they now package all of this together to keep everyone happy, but if it adds to the bottom line for me, then I don't think that is very consumer friendly.  Maybe the company doesn't want to spend money on creating various versions or wants to include what you really want in this one.  In either case, I was happy w/the material I wanted, but not so happy with the extra DVDs I wont be using.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was a wonderfully written book.  Although it took me a month and a bit longer to get half way through the book, that's because this is the fist Medieval Read I have picked up.  Really, I cannot summarize for you exactly what the book is about because there are so many things going on at one time, and you are pulled in many directions.  All I can say is that this phrase Cersei stated WILL summarize the book: &#34;To play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die.<br /><br />In other words, if you like Medieval Times, and you don't have one near you, or you like this kind of medieval war setting, or you are just ready to broaden the reading scope, I suggest this. The author did not disappoint. After much time, and watching season one on demand (to help me understand the dialect-which was also well produced), it is well worth the read or the watch......the show is very much like the book, but I like things to be left to the imagination-if you can handle the very vile, and many graphic scenes throughout (tv episode wise). By the way, I told someone that this is more vile in nature than one of Dexter's next kills. However, I know you really cannot compare, but blood wise,.....watch out.

1781161097|5.0|Exactly what I hoped it would be! This book covered the artistic and technical facets of the film with sufficient detail and accompanying graphics without going over the abyss into self-absorbed back-patting. The interviews with Scott, his crew and cast reveal as much about the plot as about the effects and production methods. There are several interesting points as to how Prometheus fits into and deviates from the Alien series. If you are a fan of the series or interested in technical film production, buy this.
B004XIVQ7Q|5.0|This book in my view is better than the Pillars of the Earth which often has a higher rating.The story is woven around historical facts and with the people linkage that Rutherfurd does so well is one of his best.Great read.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Finally watched Prometheus (Blu-Ray with DVD version).  The product... very nice all around, though I don't think I will try out the Ultra-Violet due to the issues I've read on that technology.  It was an inclusion that was not a selling point for me, so no big deal.<br /><br />The movie:  Visuals and effects?  Incredible and satisfying, so nothing to fault there.  Character development?  Ok at best with Noomi and with the android, but silly and hokey at times inre to the rest of the crew.  Not too bad overall as this is an aggressive film where the action sequences that are shown and the build-up to them leaves little time for character development... so it ends up being rather laser chiseled in where it can.  The story?  Great premise, ambitious, but would be a better long novel instead of a 2 hour movie in the telling.  That being said, it is not too hard to see that this is the first of a trilogy unfolding, and not too difficult for the Alien/Sci-Fi Horror fan's mind to fill in.  You don't have to be the 'hardcore' Alien or Sci-Fi fan or purest to enjoy this movie, but go into it without constantly comparing it to the early Alien movie looking for pitfalls, nor go into it expecting (like the 'Thing' prequel to John Carpenter's the 'Thing' did pull off) that the end of this movie immediately leads in to the original 'Alien'.  There is still some evolution to go to get to that point, but this movie does waft of the essence of that evolution, and not too bad at all with subtle tie-ins to the Alien Universe that... in juxtiposed time... is yet to come.  Finally, the Horror?  Great!  Creepy!  New Creatures and even a Zombie!  I wonder if one of the creatures was an homage to the Lovecraft 'Cthulu'!  Yes, there is still a lot of the 'why do people always do the most illogical and against all common sense things' moments during the suspense, reminiscent of slasher movies everywhere... but all in all, with the pitfalls, the lapses, the holes, and other such things that people love to lambaste in reviews... I thought this movie was entertaining and satisfying for what it is... and can clearly see it as the first part of a longer story... or prequel... that will move us eventually forward... back to the Alien Universe we have come to know and love!<br /><br />Four stars simply because, imho, Charlize and Guy Pierce were completely wasted on this film.  Their characters were weak... too weak for their presence.  I believe it would have been better to get Lance Henricksen to play Wheylan (why not, as he appears in the Alien Universe more than any other actor outside of Sigourney), and someone like Mimi Rogers or some other recognizable name to play the cold hearted company gal.  I believe NOT having their names in the cast and credits would NOT have slowed the ticket sales, nor made any difference to anything in this film if less 'screen presence' actors were used.  I really like both of them, but was especially disappointed in the character Charlize portrayed.<br /><br />BTW... Noomi is NOT Lizbeth in this movie... but IS Elisabeth... and is nothing short of a Delight!!!people love to lambaste in reviews...

B00A7ZX4RO|5.0|Like Octomom and Anna Duggar, Rihanna keeps spitting them out one after another and is rightfully deemed the busiest woman in music. She releases yet another solid winner with 'Unapologetic', an album that is one part 'Loud' and one part 'Talk That Talk' and stewed into a delectable dish. Here are some comments on my favorite cuts from the CD.<br /><br />~\\"Phresh Out The Runway\\" is the one to crank up to get in the zone. Frenetic, braggadocious, and urban, this is a banger!<br /><br />~\\"Get It Over It\\" is a gorgeous, unusual duet with hitmaker and songwriter James Fauntleroy and is my favorite cut from this CD! Their voices complement one another perfectly. How intervals in the melody glide beautifully over sustained chords throughout the song is intriguing to hear. \\"Look up, the sun is just a cloud away...\\"<br /><br />~\\"Diamonds\\" is the perfect lead single that celebrates the strength of a particular bond. The clarity of her diction is amazing.<br /><br />~\\"Numb\\" ft. Eminem is hard to describe, but I love the hell out of it. Eminem is brilliant as usual (listen for his police siren - LOL)!<br /><br />~\\"Jump\\" is drenched with the signature sound of producers Stargate (\\"Rude Boy\\" & \\"What's My Name?\\").  Containing elements of Ginuwine's 'Pony', Rihanna is point blank about how she handles a player.<br /><br />~\\"Nobody's Business\\" ft Chris Brown is a fun, upbeat flashback that salutes 1980s R&B (similar to Luther Vandross' \\"Never Too Much\\").<br /><br />~\\"Love Without Tragedy-Mother Mary\\" starts off like a 1980s pop hit that Cyndi Lauper or Sting would have recorded. The song is a personal expression that not only sounds honest, it feels sincere.<br /><br />Other songs on the CD are getting great feedback even though they haven't made as strong of an impression on me at this point. \\"Loveeee Song\\" would have been *much* better without Future's distorted, autotune vocoder. It just kills the mood. \\"Skin\\" from her 'Loud' CD got it right! Radio is so just oversaturated with euro-dance cuts, but Rihanna is comfortably in her zone on \\"Right Now\\". And fans really seem to love piano ballad \\"Stay\\".  But if I never gravitate to the other songs on the CD, 'Unapologetic' is well worth the purchase based on the songs that I do like. Rihanna remains a musical diva dynamo who at age 24 (Wow!) is doing what she was born to do! 4.5 stars!euro-dance cuts, but Rihanna is comfortably in her zone on \\"Right Now\\".

B0083DJUMA|4.0|I love the main idea of the book: that 3D printers, 3D scanners and CNC machines are becoming available to everyone and will change the world. I'm an engineer who builds factory automation, and have most of the tools the author mentions. The author compares 3D printers now with the dot matrix printer of 20 years ago. He believes that in the next 20 years 3D printers will make similar progress that laser and inkjet printers made, and the result will be an Industrial Revolution to rival anything that came before. Motley Fool had a similar article recently and went so far as to say this kind of technology would shift manufacturing from China back to the US. Honestly, the Chinese must be laughing in their boots.<br /><br />Maybe it's just my lack of imagination, but when I look around Walmart, I don't see much of anything that looks like it could be made on a 3D printer. Could we 3D print an alarm clock, a can of spray deodorant, coffee cup, ballpoint pen, jeans, dogfood? They can all be mass produced cheaply enough, and really people don't want to put a lot of thought into making all the various and sundry items in their life. The author gives an example of people making custom decals for their phones and says people will pay a premium for unique items they help create. That's true of course, and I would love to find and enter a suitable market for a side business such as this for myself. I know the opportunities are out there, and I want a piece of that.<br /><br />But knowing first hand the difference between what a plastic injection mold machine can make in a day vs. a 3D printer, I don't see this changing the world in the way the author imagines in our lifetime.<br /><br />It was a fun read anyway, and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

B005HSG3U6|4.0|Like all kindle accessories, this is definately overpriced.  I got it as one of the lightning deals $12.99, so I figured I would give it a try.  My husband has the leather cover that marware makes and I like that a lot better.  It has a lot thicker protection for the screen and two different levels to angle the kindle at for watching movies.  I also have a timbuk2 plush sleeve that I bought before I bought this one and I think that also provides a lot more protection.  This one is just nice because it has the ability to stand up for watching movies.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HIS VOICE!  He did a really cool remake of Wicked Game.  Get Up Get Down is hot.  Everything rocks, really recommend this; it doesn't sound like an Idol Cd..it already has the feel and flow of a true artist!
B009LK6JS2|4.0|This is one of the better FAOTDs in recent weeks. Yes, it is a bit difficult to learn, but there are tutorials that guide you through it. I was able to land safely on my third try, so it's nowhere near impossible.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Graphics are quite good<br /> - Tutorials are more-or-less helpful (although it takes a while to get through them all)<br /> - Controls work quite well (and they can be calibrated)<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Long load times<br /> - Not much variation<br /><br />All in all, it's not a bad app, especially considering the price (for today).
081095415X|5.0|I Love this book and it gives voice to the animals..and a spot light on there issues...! This is a great gift..! Enjoy...
B0049VZ222|5.0|LOVE this show. My dvr died and I lost all my pre-recorded shows. Then to top it off, dish dropped AMC... so I turned to Amazon and was so very happy they were showing The Walking Dead the day after it shows on TV. Dish ended up putting AMC back on after the 3rd episode of the season aired and I ended my subscription to The Walking Dead but I can honestly say that the quality of the show was good (I used my google tv to log in to amazon and stream it onto my tv) and I will be using Amazon again to watch my shows when traveling or if dish pulls another stunt.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I have been seeing war films since the early 1940's.  I remember the war years of WWII well.  &#34;The<br />Pacific&#34; is one of the two best war films I have ever seen. (The other one was &#34;The Thin Red Line.&#34;)<br />&#34;The Pacific&#34; is a no nonsense, realistic, unsentimental, portrayal of the horror of island fighting the  Marines experienced against the formidable Japanese, and the effect the war had on the American<br />survivors after the fighting was done.  The miniseries is just excellent!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. I had to get a subscription because DISH stopped carrying AMC... then all of a sudden, after the 3rd episode, they started carrying it again. I guess they are trying to play nice. The show itself is different from your typical zombie shows. The caste is dynamic and the storyline is intense. The sad thing is that I really don't see much difference between how these zombies are and how people are when things get bad... mindlessly trying to take, mindlessly killing and mindlessly being killed. No wonder why so many are referring to the unprepared as zombies...
B000SXLL8O|5.0|it was a free album from the amazon cloud and who doesn't love classic coldplay. all their music is ground breaking.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really liked the storyline that was portrayed. It's a great love story more or less with everything else that's in it.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|great action movie that is entertaining and keeps you guess at every corner. its a movie worth owning and watching often.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|awesome is all I'm going to say it was really funny and full of pictures and pages it was awesome

0880793082|2.0|Thoth Tarot is the most impressing and beautiful tarot set to me. It is great art and very powerful symbolizm. The two stars apply to the given size: Small Tarot. I wanted to get some pocket sized cards to take with me. These cards are far from being small. They are regular sized, which with the Thoth Tarot is big already.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Excellent film. Really brings Julia Child close. You get excited about cooking, and come to appreciate Julia Child as a true underdog overcoming adversity. Very well done. (No pun intended)
B0085RQLXK|1.0|Aerosmith rolls out of bed for a snore-fest, just as they do every ten years or so. Only this time, they forgot to change their man-diapers. I'm a devoted fan from Boston, and remember when they walked on water at WBCN, in the Fens, at the Rat and Paradise, etc. So, I go way back. I want to like their new stuff. I long to like their stuff. It's \\"me\\".<br /><br />I felt as flat as warm beer in a lip-stick rimmed Solo cup from last night's Allston rave when I played this lousy CD.<br /><br />The songs on this CD are as lifeless as a blow-up doll after a Boston College frat party. They reek like the hairless armpits of a neurotic Harvard undergrad during finals week.<br /><br />Honestly, if you just listen to the samples on Amazon and iTunes, you get a sense of how spiritless these tunes really are. Smells like teen spirit? Try: smells like Rico Petrocelli's bedside commode.<br /><br />No sense wasting your dollars on what will be -- along with \\"Just Push Play\\", \\"Nine Lives\\", \\"Night In The Ruts\\", to name a few of their Pepe LePew albums -- nothing more than recycled insulation blown into the walls of your crazy Auntie Jean's Hampton Beach rental bungalow.<br /><br />It's a shame, because the brilliance of this band --\\"Pump\\", \\"Rocks\\", \\"Toys\\", hell, even the sloppy \\"Draw The Line\\" -- is truly awesome, memorable and \\"crankable\\". An aural eargasm. Those are \\"stand and beat your chest like a great baboon\\" CDs. Even the snot-nosed, AM radio friendly molasses that is \\"Get A Grip\\" is better than \\"Dimension\\". And \\"Get a Grip\\" stinks!<br /><br />The \\"Dimension\\" CD is like a whoopie cushion with a hole in it. Full of promise for a good time, laughs and fun, but ultimately a deflated mess.

B0073LWEXK|1.0|I wouldn't even rate this a 1 star but I had to in order to write something.  Don't download this game unless you are familiar with it.  I am not and I can't figure out how to play it and there are no instructions.  It is horrible.
B009R9WAZ8|4.0|Three years ago, Rihanna released, what was in my opinion, her best album yet; &#34;Rated R&#34;. The album found her, or her producers and writers, lyrically and sonically pushing the envelope with songs like &#34;Russian Roulette&#34;, &#34;G4L&#34;, and &#34;Photographs&#34;, to mention a few. &#34;Unapologetic&#34; sounds like the logical follow-up to that album, and much like that collection, is laden with winners, while trying something a bit new here and there, and attempting to stretch vocally.<br /><br />Opening cut &#34;Fresh Off The Runway&#34; layers distorted synths over Hip Hop beats. The delightful lead-single &#34;Diamonds&#34; is somber electro R&B set to plodding beats. &#34;Numb&#34; is trippy Middle eastern Dub with distorted slowed-down vocals by Eminem. &#34;Pour It Up&#34; is that hazy R&B sound Drake, The Weeknd or The-Dream are known for, as is the moody mid tempo &#34;Loveeeee Song&#34; featuring an auto-tuned Future pleading for &#34;love and affection&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;Jump&#34; is Dubstep and samples Ginuwine's hit &#34;Pony&#34;. The David Guetta-penned & produced &#34;Right Now&#34; is a catchy club anthem with Techno and Dubstep flourishes. Next come a pair of ballads; &#34;What Now&#34; (an acoustic/piano ballad with an almost Dub Step chorus) and the spare Elton John-style piano ballad &#34;Stay&#34; featuring Mikky Ekko (who reminds me of Thom Yorke). The eighties-sounding R&B/House &#34;Nobody's Business&#34; features Chris Brown (channelling MJ) and is lyrically both of them against the world, set to an insanely catchy groove.<br /><br />Next comes the album's highlight, the ambitious tempo-shifting 7 minute long &#34;Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary&#34; with chiming guitars and personal confessional lyrics (&#34;You took the best years of my life&#34;). &#34;Get Over It&#34; is dreamy with lush synth strings and spare percussion. &#34;No Love Around&#34; is drum-free woozy Reggae with Rihanna singing &#34;Your love hit me to the core, I was fine until you knocked me to the floor.&#34; Closing is &#34;Lost In Paradise&#34;, bouncy Pop with pseudo Dubstep flourishes.<br /><br />The deluxe version has two remixes of &#34;Diamonds&#34;, as well as the Emile Sand&eacute;-penned ballad &#34;Half Of Me&#34; where she tells us that what we see on television is &#34;half of it... half of me&#34;. Much will be made of the lyrics of most of the songs (is she singing about Chris Brown or not?), but this is undeniably good. Love it!you knocked me to the floor.&#34; Closing is &#34;Lost In Paradise&#34;, bouncy Pop with pseudo Dubstep flourishes.  The deluxe version has two remixes of &#34;Diamonds&#34;, as well as the Emile Sandé-penned ballad &#34;Half Of Me&#34; where she tells us that what we see on television is &#34;half of it... half of me&#34;.

0618918248|5.0|I probably land in a small group of people that found Dawkins' book helpful in leaving Christianity and becoming an atheist, for the record this book was helpful too: [[ASIN:B001NLKTR4 Losing My Religion]] as the author was also a former Christian and had similar experiences as I have had (For the record I'm working on a book about my experience as well).<br /><br />Some history:  Before I read this book it had been sitting on the bookshelf for a couple years (gift from atheist dad) and I'd glanced at it, read a few pages here and there, but never got around to reading it.  I'd read most of [[ASIN:0141026162 The Blind Watchmaker]] many years previous (when I was still a creationist) and found the information interesting, but not convincing enough at the time to change my world view.<br /><br />My mother was a Christian pastor at a large corporate type church in Southern California before illness forced her to retire, the irony of her being forced to retire due to life debilitating illness from a church that regularly prayed for the sick and taught that God heals people all the time was not lost on me.  This is the home church of JP Moreland, author of books such as this: [[ASIN:031027432X Kingdom Triangle: Recover the Christian Mind, Renovate the Soul, Restore the Spirit's Power]], so we are not talking back woods hicks handling snakes, but reasonably intelligent (mostly white middle to upper middle class) suburbanite  Christians.  The main pastor published this: [[ASIN:0977202399 Simple Thoughts on Leadership]] and the church is the \\"mother\\" church of a growing international movement.<br /><br />Anyway, I give the back story there to explain I'm not writing a positive review of this book posing as a Christian or as someone that was predisposed to accept atheism (in fact I've left up dozens of my Christian book reviews written over the years here on Amazon, although I have posted an \\"edit\\" on most of them explaining my new beliefs).<br /><br />What I liked about this book was that it challenged me to look at a lot of my old beliefs with a critical eye and try to view issues objectively.  Certain truths in this book are nearly undeniable, like the fact that children growing up in a Catholic home or a Muslim home or main stream Christian home are going to believe stuff they are taught by their parents, so we go around calling them \\"Christian children\\" or \\"Muslim Children\\" but they really have had no choice about what they believe, no Christians I ever knew, ever, taught their children that Jesus might be a myth and that they should critically think about religion and truth before deciding what to believe.<br /><br />I was challenged to rethink logically a lot of what I'd come to believe in about prayer for the sick based upon what Dawkins' researched here, specifically the study that showed that people that \\"know\\" they are being prayed for can actually end up worse off.  I never would have believed this before, but it makes perfect sense now.  I'd like to see more academic studies done on this effect.  As a side note, one of the pastors at my old church had broken a vertebra in his neck a few years back from a tragic accident, he was told he'd probably be a quadriplegic.  He and his family wouldn't accept that and they of course prayed and prayed, however, here's the key:  he worked extremely hard at his recovery, in fact he posted a Youtube video of how hard he worked on recovery, hours of grueling pain, and guess what?  He can walk now and use his arms, but he's not miraculously healed (although he'd say he was) because he still walks funny, has a lot of internal issues and nothing about his recovery was supernatural (it didn't just happen and if \\"god\\" healed him, \\"god\\" did a crappy job of it, or else he'd not be having so many problems now).<br /><br />But these beliefs are so so damn hard to give up.  I know.<br /><br />So don't think a Christian can just read this book and \\"give up Christianity\\" it doesn't work that easy.But I do have some advice for those that are thinking of using this book to help someone get out of the delusion of religion and find true freedom in this short life.<br /><br />With Christians, start with a couple books: [[ASIN:0802800491 The Subversion of Christianity]] and [[ASIN:0687361591 Resident Aliens: A Provocative Christian Assessment of Culture and Ministry for People Who Know that Something is Wrong]] because both of these books give extremely compelling evidence that the Christian church as it currently exists is completely off track as far as following \\"New Testament\\" Christianity or the teachings of Jesus (or attributed to him) on any meaningful level.<br /><br />In other words, start by explaining that the church they go to, and the beliefs they hold, how they act, how they vote, how they treat others bears next to nothing to the teachings in the Bible they claim to believe in.<br /><br />Jacques Ellul was a French Christian anarchist, who wrote extensively about Christianity, and the book I link to above, The Subversion of Christianity is a good place to start although you'll be hard pressed to get an average Christian to read substantial non-fiction, but I love the work of Ellul because while he believed in Jesus and shares the common tenants of faith with the average believer, he pulls no punches in showing (from their own scripture) how off base they are.<br /><br />This is important because just trying to get a Christian to believe their faith is wrong because of someone like Dawkins is almost never going to happen.<br /><br />And I believe it's important, I have come to agree with Dawkins and other like minded people that religion is mostly damaging and hurtful to humanity, it causes so much unnecessary pain and we spend so much time and money as a society trying to get others to follow the beliefs of the majority because they can vote rules into existence and force compulsion by gunpoint.<br /><br />Speaking of this issue, here's another couple good books to start challenging your Christian friends or family with: [[ASIN:0310267315 The Myth of a Christian Nation: How the Quest for Political Power Is Destroying the Church]] and [[ASIN:0310283833 The Myth of a Christian Religion: Losing Your Religion for the Beauty of a Revolution]] because Boyd is a really good writer, and he challenges much of the commonly held beliefs and actions of the average American Christian.<br /><br />Once you can get someone to realize that their church and how they personally act bears little resemblance to what is taught in the New Testament by Paul (and especially that they bear almost nothing to what a \\"Christ following\\" believer would look like--if they actually followed what they believe are his teachings) you can then get them to start questioning, as I did:<br /><br />\\"If Jesus is actually real, and living and breathing in believers, why aren't Christians like him at all?\\"<br /><br />When I started questioning myself about this very question, and reading some of the books I've linked to above, and others, and really started thinking about this, I came to one very striking conclusion; Jesus as the \\"God who loves us and changes us\\" can't be real, if he was/is, he's not very nice.<br /><br />Since the Jesus I've believed in for years and years obviously does nothing to change the people that claim to have him actually living inside them, the evidence is that he's a myth, for those that disagree, read this [[ASIN:0801065062 Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God]] and DO what this book teaches (from the Bible) for a solid year and expect your church and friends to do the same.  Not going to happen, but I'd love to hear from anyone with even a tiny amount of success.<br /><br />Once I'd come to that point, of realizing that nobody really believes this stuff enough to do what it says, nearly all Christians I've known are in fact what I like to call \\"functional atheists\\", they say they believe but theirlives resemble next to nothing to actual Christianity as taught in the Bible (or as shown here [[ASIN:1581345186 No Little People]]), then this book was able to speak to a more open mind in myself, I wasn't grasping at trying to prove Dawkins wrong to myself and find faults with everything he wrote.<br /><br />So, I write this review in some hopes of starting a dialogue with myself and others about how to effectively get people out of the destructive nature of the church and religion in general.<br /><br />I know lots of agnostics and atheists have read this book and loved it and reviewed it positively, but so what?  You guys were already there, it was \\"preaching to the choir\\".....<br /><br />I think lots of Christians out there know somewhere in their intellect that something is wrong, most of what they do at and around church is social club stuff, and yes, I know many Christians feed poor people and help when an earthquake hits, but so what?  My atheist father is far more generous than most Christians I know, it proves nothing, except maybe most people, at heart, want to be decent and kind to other humans.  Giving a couple bucks here and there isn't Christianity as taught in the Bible, not even close.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I do recommend this book, but if your purpose is to get someone to change their thinking or to challenge their beliefs (Christians, not necessarily other faiths) I'd suggest tilling the soil with some other things first.e good books to start challenging your Christian friends or family with: [[ASIN:0310267315 The Myth of a Christian Nation: How the Quest for Political Power Is Destroying the Church]] and [[ASIN:0310283833 The Myth of a Christian Religion: Losing Your Religion for the Beauty of a Revolution]] because Boyd is a really good writer, and he challenges much of the commonly held beliefs and actions of the average American Christian.<br /><br />Once you can get someone to realize that their church and how they personally act bears little resemblance to what is taught in the New Testament by Paul (and especially that they bear almost nothing to what a \\"Christ following\\" believer would look like--if they actually followed what they believe are his teachings) you can then get them to start questioning, as I did:<br /><br />\\"If Jesus is actually real, and living and breathing in believers, why aren't Christians like him at all?\\"<br /><br />When I started questioning myself about this very question, and reading some of the books I've linked to above, and others, and really started thinking about this, I came to one very striking conclusion; Jesus as the \\"God who loves us and changes us\\" can't be real, if he was/is, he's not very nice.<br /><br />Since the Jesus I've believed in for years and years obviously does nothing to change the people that claim to have him actually living inside them, the evidence is that he's a myth, for those that disagree, read this [[ASIN:0801065062 Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God]] and DO what this book teaches (from the Bible) for a solid year and expect your church and friends to do the same.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I gave this five stars because...it's Columbo!<br />He's one of the most iconic tv detectives out there.  If you've never seen this show before, you'll soon love Columbo's style of crime solving and his way of nailing the murderer.
0307346617|5.0|WOW, I'd never have considered reading a book like this, not because I don't like fantasy/sci-fi as a rule, it's just that the is so much of it and I have so little time.  But my son bought this and I wanted to see what the fuss was about and so I tried it.  I loved it.<br /><br />I've gotten way into the dystopian story craze, love love love The Walking Dead series on AMC, and I'd already read some time ago the non-fiction [[ASIN:B003Q5XC0Q How to Survive the End of the World As We Know It]] and really enjoyed that and recommend it too, and I believe something is coming....<br /><br />Anyway, this book may not appeal to those that don't care for the short stories that fit together format, I almost gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 because of that, but it is what it is and that's how it was written and I loved it too much to not give it 5 stars.  Anyway, I hear the movie is coming but I don't see how they'll not screw this up.  We'll see, it might just be a great action flick.<br /><br />Anyway, back to reality, the zombies are coming in some form, it might just be another black plague or Flu of 1918 or so terrorist attack that unleashes some yet unknown virus, or something like this: [[ASIN:0765317737 The White Plague]], who knows?  That's the fun of this stuff, we know something wants to eat us, have you read the [[ASIN:0679430946 The Hot Zone]]?  There is a lot of flesh out there and evolution always brings something to eat the protein of overproducing animals, be they apex predators or not...<br /><br />So, if you have any interest in zombies and a possible peak at the future, check this book out.

B007KW5N9Y|5.0|It's ironic that both \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and \\"Empire of the Sun\\" were finally released on Blu Ray the same day last week(Nov.13). Ironic for two reasons, the first being that they are \\"epic\\" films of the kind that is very rarely made today. And second because David Lean, the director of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" was originally scheduled to direct \\"Empire of the Sun\\" with Spielberg producing. Lean spent a year on the pre-production shortly after his return to filmmaking with \\"A Passage to India\\" (1984) after a fourteen year absence before finally turning the whole thing over to Spielberg. That was a wise decision because \\"Empire of the Sun\\" would have looked completely different had Lean actually made the picture himself. I've always liked \\"Empire of the Sun\\" since I first saw it at the old Cinema 21 theatre in San Diego upon it's release in December, 1987. I've owned every home video version of it from VHS and regular DVD and also purchased both the vinyl and CD of John Williams superb music score as well. Now with this brilliant new Blu Ray version thru Warner Home Video, my collection is complete. \\"Empire of the Sun\\" on Blu Ray is stunning to say the least. Every detail, no matter how small, is crystal clear. There is some minor grain in one scene filmed inside a rusting tanker that serves as a hideout for John Malkovich's character, but it doesn't last that long and doesn't detract from Allen Daviau's brilliant photography. Colors, period costumes, Japanese warplanes and everything else just pop off the screen. This is the best that \\"Empire\\" has looked since it was first released twenty-five years ago. Christian Bale is perfect as the young Jim Graham who comes of age after being separated from his mother in the crowded panic driven streets of Shanghai during the Japanese invasion of that city in 1941. Warning to all children: Do not let go of your mother's hand if you're ever in a situation like this. It's that separation, along with alienation and the loss of innocence that make \\"Empire\\" one of Spielberg's greatest films. It was his second \\"serious\\" film following \\"The Color Purple\\" in 1985 after making such entertaining and crowd pleasing films such as \\"Jaws\\", \\"ET\\", \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", etc. He would go on to bigger heights and acclaim with \\"Schindler's List\\"(1993),\\"Saving Private Ryan\\"(1998) and the just released \\"Lincoln\\". His work on \\"Empire\\" certainly paved the way for those later films. Fans of Christain Bale won't be surprised to see how good he was as a young child actor in his first starring role if they only know him from the \\"Batman\\" films. As he proved in his Oscar winning role in \\"The Fighter\\" he was born to act. Spoiler alert: The final scene when Bale's character Jim is finally reunited with his mother and father is one of the most touching and heartrending scenes ever put on film. It was done with little dialogue and was the perfect ending to such an outstanding film. \\"Empire of the Sun\\" was praised by most of the critics at the time, but did not do well at the box office. It was nominated for six Oscars but was overshadowed that year by another film about China, Bernardo Bertolucci's \\"The Last Emperor\\" which won the Oscar as Best Picture. But that's okay because both films can stand on their own as filmmaking at it's best. This new Blu Ray Edition is a digibook release much like the other Warner digibook titles of the past few years. There is a second disc called \\"Warner at War\\" which is narrated by Steven Spielberg and covers the efforts of Warner Bros. studios during World War Two. There are many clips from Warner films of this era such as \\"Sgt. York\\" and \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\" among others. \\"Empire of the Sun\\" may not be as popular as some of Spielberg's other films, but it certainly deserves another look on Blu-ray and comes highly recommended.is a must own on Blu Ray and gets the highest rating.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was so depressed after reading this book. Nobody is the hero and certainly not the heroine. I found the reaction of Amy REALLY over the top. I couldn't get a feel for why Nick did what he did nor Amy's reactions. I found the switching between characters rather exhausting. I stuck with the book because I wanted to see how it would end. The ending was beyond horrible. I am so sorry that I invested my time reading this book.

B009E3EY38|5.0|I remember when this reunion happened a few years ago, and all Led Zeppelin fans were hoping a full reunion world tour could happen. Unfortunately, Robert Plant refused and it never happened. I got to see \\"Celebration Day\\" in the theater last month, and when it was over, it made me wish it happened even more. Despite haven't not played together in over 2 decades (except for the forgettable \\"Live-Aid\\" and Atlantic's 40th Anniversary), they were masterful on this night. My biggest surprise was Jason Bonham being able to pull off an incredible impersonation of his father. He doesn't quite have the power and style of John, but he more than held his own. Robert Plant's voice will never be what it was in the 70's, but he manged to get through even the toughest Zeppelin songs. Jimmy Page was his usual masterful self. Another surprise was John Paul Jones. His performance really shows what an incredible musician and under-rated member of Led Zeppelin he is. I think Zeppelin's overall performance is better than the \\"The Song Remains the Same\\". The bottom line is, if you're a Led Zeppelin fan, you have to own \\"Celebration Day\\". It will not only bring back memories of one of the greatest bands of all time, it will make you wonder what could have been if John Bonham didn't leave us way too early.

I claim Jeff Tweedy. I'll admit it was the third disk I heard from them, after &#34;A ghost is born&#34; and &#34;being there,&#34; but man, I dug this CD. Since then I saw them at Red Rocks in Colorado...a choicy decision I might add since the lineup there this summer was thick with great stuff. This one made me realize that all I knew of Wilco was the tip of the iceberg, and boy have I done some discovering since. Pure magic, deep reflection, amazing sound. They are my favorite band. Phish being second. Sorry Phish.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|WONDERFUL! One of the best books I've ever read.  One of few books I immediately went to the first page and started over!  Have recommended to everyone I know as a GREAT read with wonderful story and message.
B000002KHF|5.0|This album is not only a must for Van Morrison fans, but for anyone who dug the last waltz (since the track &#34;caravan&#34; is performed on that DVD), or for ANYONE else really. Going through tough times? Listen to this album to begin your day and it will get you through it. I will venture to put a guarantee on that. You don't even need any other cd's. sometimes I just listen to this one in its entirety back to back to get going in the morning. My cousin hipped me to the routine last year. that's sayin a lot since I used to be an on-air DJ in college and probably have more music than you do at home. Cheers
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|Interesting, but basically “old wine in new bottles“. It already confirmed what I already knew. Easy to read and understand.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I am really enjoying this new game.  The theme is fun, and the characters are all really cute.  I think I will be playing a lot.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|This has most the hits and is contains more than Forty Licks.  The only drawback to the collection, and it is a major drawback, is the abridged versions of some of the great tunes.  To cut \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" down to less than 5 minutes is a crime.  Come on fellas, how can you trim so much from one of the great anthems of the late sixties.  Cut back on the number of tunes on the cd if you must, but don't be cutting the length of the original tracks.  Still a good collection just misses the mark for me.  I understand that bands want to present the listener with as much of their music as possible in greatest hits packages, but when they don't give full length versions of songs it short changes the buying public.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|A beautiful novel of love and mystery. I wish I could actually visit this circus. I feel as if I know the characters and I am sad it has ended. The start was difficult, I had to re check the chapters and dates be fore I realised how many characters I was following and what time scale the book was written over. It was we'll worth persevering, even I caught on in plenty of time.
B009A87X80|5.0|Apparently, this looks like the last of the late Eva Cassidy's recordings has been released to the general public, and the powers who are responsible for her catalogue have found it necessary to release one more anthology of some of her best known work.  If there are still any people who have not had the opportunity to experience Eva's recordings up until now, I suppose this is as good a place to start as any, but I regard it as cheap and tasteless marketing.  I have every single one of her compact discs, and all of the songs in this package appear elsewhere.<br /><br />That being said, there hasn't been a female vocalist since Eva's passing in 1996 who has appeared on the music scene who can hold a candle to her genius.  All the recordings in this package, especially \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\", \\"Kathy's Song\\", and \\"Fields Of Gold\\", are quintessential, and Eva made them hers.  I am disappointed, however, that a song written by another late Washington, DC area musician, Roger Henderson's \\"A Penny To My Name\\", was not included, having done exceptionally well in Europe upon its release a decade ago.<br /><br />If you have been living under a rock for the last twenty years and are just discovering who Eva was, feel free to start here, but don't stop here.  All of her albums are treasures, and you need to hear all of them to grasp just who this talented woman really was.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|beatles boxed set remastered 2012<br />very pleased with the quality and amazing book something i will pass on for generations<br />and the speed of delivery super fast, well pleased....
B005F8CL1S|5.0|Every artists should package their entire studio collection at a budget price in a simple but informative package. I welcome Cohen dylan beatles etc collections which rids of the horrible plastic covers and to save space.

B003TJR2HS|3.0|It converts the voltage like it is advertise between the first generation Apple products to the newer products.  It only gets a 3 star because it was misleading.  This does not fit Lifeproof case.  Apparently CableJive has (2) different adapters: a basic and a plus.  The charge converter is the plus which does not fit the Lifeproof case. While the basic is suppose to fit but won't convert the charge. (I did not get the basic adapter since I needed it fast.  I got a Lifeproof adapter from a local store.)  Go to their website and it explains it out for you.  Wish the seller would update their description to reflect this because it is very misleading....

B009A9BEHU|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD. It is always fun to hear the story from the band members own words. Great DVD. I really love Coldplay's music. They really know how to make good music. Watching that DVD makes you want to follow the band everywhere they go.

B00371QQ0M|5.0|I appreciate the movie, because it's not often a sci-fi movie does not become a horror B-movie. It looks beautiful on Blu-ray. I don't get the complaints about the dirt and specs, I did not notice them, and I have good eyesight.  It's strange people complain about perfectly good image quality while giving rave reviews to crappy presentations.  The review for \\"Rebecca\\" blu-ray image quality was unanimously good, but it looks like total crap, that kind of quality is not acceptable even for standard DVD.  The last 20 minutes or so has flashes and huge amount of specs it was unwatchable. I don't get it.
B004J4XGN6|3.0|The core idea that you should validate there is a customer for your product before you invest a lot of time and money in building it is helpful, and that in order to get a good read on real customer behavior you should validate your idea in a way that gauges a genuine customer engagement (what customers would actually do versus say they would do) is important. And then there are various examples of how this can be done (create a landing page with call to actions that to the customer appear to be real, or the dropbox viral video, or the concierge MVP example) which is nice. Where I think this book does a dis-service to its own credibility is:    1. With the case studies, which start of giving a detailed account of the situation but are lacking in substantive results - aside from the IMVU examples, many of the others leave open questions, Groupon is a questionable success at this point and tainted by a Ponzi image and the fleecing of merchants; Kodak Gallery failed and there is no explanation for this; the QuickBooks example goes on in some detail until the conclusion which says \\"QuickBooks that shipped that year had significantly higher customer satisfaction ratings and sold more units,\\" this is too vague of a result to be compelling proof tied back to the methodology. Conversely, some companies which are wildly successful like Apple are indicted for they way they work for reasons I can't understand, if the goal is to create a product customers want, the criticism of Apple methodology doesn't really make sense    2. While the book claims to give you a scientifically proven methodology for success, I think to term it scientific is misleading. Yes, the methodology is about empirical data, but from what I can recall there is no discussion on statistical significance or anything that hints at making sure your data shows a valid results. I've watched many a multi-variant test start out with really interesting results only to normalize to small differences when the resultsreach statistical significance. Even statistically significant results cause problems for scientists who can't replicate their own results [...] so some measure of validation should be a more explicit part of the methodology, if this book is about a scientific recipe for success    To me this is a good idea stretched into a book with a mixed bag of examples that don't really prove the idea, but it is a good read, lightly covers some other business practices like those developed by Toyota and \\"you are what you measure\\" and so forth. Also a good reminder in the book about the difference between vision (the problem statement) and strategy (how you get there, could be multiple paths).
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|BraveHeart,in my opinion is Thee Best movie of the past fifty years.Mel Gibson does an Outstanding job of portraying Wallace.There are a few cicumstances where the facts were bent or changd abit but the story is there and is Very understandable.I have seen Gibson in many of His films and has definiely proven to be an actor who will be around for a long time.If He is is another 25 more movies He,in my book,will Always be William Wallace. No matter what He does or says outside of films cannot be taken away from His acting abilities,He is a very fine Actor.In Braveheart the cast that was put together is astounding and have played in movies involving the same period of time.One example,remember Uncle Argyle,well look for Him in Rob Roy.The BraveHeart of Wallace and His Men will be remembered in the Hearts of people through out time ...
B004A8ZX28|3.0|If you're like me you don't care if a movie is a paint-by-the-numbers thriller because there's a twist, there's a twist! And if you couldn't see it coming that makes it all worthwhile. Liam Neeson is compelling as a Hitchcokian everyman thrust into the middle of a vast conspiracy and January Jones is...well, not Betty Draper. \\"Unknown\\" starts with a nightmare tourist-in-Berlin scenario and just gets more elaborate from there. There are chases and cool double reversals. Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz are on hand to bring old-guy gravitas. Did I mention that there's a twist and I totally didn't see it coming, despite being on the lookout for something tricky because how else could this movie go? This is a generic thriller with a tonally jarring ending and a title so unmemorable that it's kind of impressive, but who cares? \\"Unknown\\" delivers.
B00001QEE6|5.0|This is a simple love story featuring dogs who have personalities you can identify with. The sound improvements and widescreen view make this even more enjoyable.
B00A4W3AJC|3.0|My first reaction was disappointment. The premise--a middle-aged man is shuttled around Paris in a white stretch limousine so that he can don disguises and act out a series of seemingly unrelated scenes as different people--has potential but ends up more arty than mind-blowing. There's melodrama but little real feeling, and no clear rules governing what unfolds, so the stakes feel low. This is a series of gestures, not a fully-realized world. Disappointingly for a movie that sets itself up to go practically anywhere, many of the vignettes are not that interesting, and the visual style has a dim-lit uniformity. Holy Motors feels like it could have been a lot weirder than it is.<br /><br />And yet I found myself still thinking about it the next day. The boring parts receded in my memory, leaving the good bits to stand out more. Leading man Denis Lavant is a compelling presence, both as the various characters he inhabits and as the actor behind them, bone-weary in the back of a limo peeling off makeup. Likewise you can't fault director Leos Carax for lack of ambition. He's aiming for something specific and personal, if oddly muted. And the movie still has its go-for-broke moments, including two musical numbers, one of which is the most electrifying accordion intermission ever committed to film. I can't say that I enjoyed Holy Motors, or tell you if it's any good, but I'm glad I saw it.
044042321X|2.0|I was very disappointed when this book arrived.  I thought it was a novel as described in the title, but it's a comic book.  over priced and not at all what I was wanting.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille always provides deep details for the geography and culture of the story.<br />Add this book to your must read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Although there is debate that this trilogy has been a copy of Battle Royale, the writing is undeniably great.  Suzanne's ability to convey pain is remarkable.  I was so disappointed when I finished this trilogy.  Fantastic read!  I would recommend this to any young adult looking for an adventurous read.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I have read all 5 books and find them to have a rediculous plot, there are too many villains. It lacks a believable plot line or redeemig value. Some of the characters are interesting but most of the plot twists are rediculous.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|So far, Season 3 has not been a let down. A lot of twists and some major upsets. For the hard core fan, you'll love it!
B009VB97EY|4.0|I gave it four stars for the dancing. It is amazing the way they can move. It was fun to watch,not for the under 18 crowd that's for sure. I found the story line to be lacking, actually I felt like it just dropped off.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|This book is on point right out the gate Deepak Chopra provides us with the keys to finding ones true purpose in life .  Applying the  spiritual laws we can all find our unique talents to live a more harmonious and abundant life.

B009GENZ12|4.0|Complex, unpredictable, worth watching. I never saw  an ad for this movie and didn't know what to expect. watch it.
B00005PJ6M|5.0|Thank you for providing a classic movie to us.  We can always count on Amazon to bring us the movies we truly enjoy--from old to new--they come to us timely and well packaged.
B000H1RFKU|5.0|A movie you will never forget.<br /><br />Action and suspense filled but language and actions in the movie are not meant for everyone.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I didn't have great things to say about the first book of this series, but this second one is much better as both the plot and characters develop more fully.  Again, while sexually explicit, if you're looking for another &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; this isn't it, but the story line becomes much more involved and interesting, and I'm looking forward to the third installment.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|This is such a wonderful movie. It's one of my family's favorites of all time.  Anyone will have fun watching!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|The characters are well thought out. The plot just keeps growing and growing. The actions of all the characters (noble and not so noble) fit so well. I was genuinely sad that the novel ended. Cannot wait for the next book.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|This movie handles everything masterfully!  It is a Christmas classic in my home.  Everyone of all ages would enjoy.  My favorite Tom Hanks film by far!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Just fabulous.  This is so creative and I believe will sell lots of copies.  I put on my headphones so I could really get into it.  I can't even compare Phil to anyone out there.  He is one of a kind and so unique.  I highly recommend this to all you Phil Phillips fans.  He sounds wonderful on this.  So great to have some original music at last and well worth waiting for.  He is so talented.

B008GBCMHO|5.0|I recommend this movie for anyone of any age.  We loved it so much that I bought it for my family to watch any time we want.
0446580848|2.0|The Panther is the first book I've read of DeMille's books.  He didn't impress me with his character John Corey.  Too many wisecracks and sarcasm.  The book was too long for the plot, perhaps 100 - 150 pages could have been cut out for the reader to finally get to the Panther and Corey confrontation.  Did anyone notice how many times the word 'right' was used by Corey?  Aggravating to say the least.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Most of us have heard of the Toy Story series. If you haven't watched then you've missed out on a great movie adventure!
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I've only read the chapter on meta learning. So far I can say that the teaching in here is very valuable. If someone does not know the principles in here, well they should.<br />What this book teaches is not really something new, but that's not the point. The point is that it is nicely compressed in a simple and actionable way.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many figure legends and text-in-figure is really small and it is very difficult to read in the kindle version. You may learn new skills, but trying to read this in a kindle you may as well become blind ;)<br />Up to the meta-learning chapter the book is certainly good and already worth the price of the kindle version. However, I give it not full 5 stars because of the problem that I mention with the figures. This should have been better dealt with. Anyway, it's not like you won't be able to follow the book if you don't read the text-in-figure. I recommend this book anyway.<br /><br />Everyone should read the chapter on meta-learning and APPLY its principles.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|My family has thoroughly enjoyed the Toy Story movie experience. My kids have grown up right along side Woody and Buzz. And they will always be a joy to watch over and over!

B007HU7NBK|4.0|Book starts out a bit slow and lengthy regarding childhood,teen years. By middle gets into the behind the scene look at Duran Duran's formation, and all the years of drug use, partying, and basically what life in a boy band from Britain was like. Enjoyed \\"seeing\\" the life of Duran Duran from the inside, was actually SHOCKED a bit to hear how badly John Taylor was hooked on the drugs and alcohol. As a huge Duran Duran fan growing up, I always thought life was \\"perfect\\" for these guys. Guess it's like they say, the \\"Grass is always greener..\\". Glad to hear he has straightened himself out, life is too short to waste your health on drugs. Especially when so many fans love your music!!

B009H5IS1W|5.0|Unlike most shows into their 8th season criminal minds keeps and peaks your intrest . I'm not saying every  episode is a nail biter,  however it keeps you coming back.  Enjoyable. Frightening in some respects with writers that read police  reports instead of comic books, that other series writers seem obsessed with

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games isn't something I would normally read because of its subject matter: kids killing kids in a race to see who outwits and outlives the others. However, after I picked up the book and began reading I couldn't put it down. The subject matter still is disturbing. I found it mind-boggling how the main character--as well as the other kids--accepted their situation. For me, the worst part was showing the adults actually enjoying such \\"entertainment!\\" Even with the horror the kids endured, the \\"audience approval\\" remained their goal. A very well written and startling story.
B0086700CM|4.0|I use this to distract my 6 yr old when we are travelling. He loves to play and knows how to use all the features better than I ever could.
B009E3EY38|5.0|This is worth the price alone for the versions of \\"For Your Life\\" which was never before performed in concert and \\"Trampled Under Foot\\", and therefore gets 5 starts.  Haven't listened yet beyond Trampled Under Foot, but other than these, the songs thus far have been standard fare.  \\"In My Time of Dying\\" is above average but I still like the Black Crows/Jimmy Page version better.  Some of the songs seem rushed (\\"Good Times, Bad Times\\") and Page's guitar is a mildly annoying timber, perhaps because of the mixing, but again, \\"For Your Life\\" and \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" are amazing and worth the cost of this set.  I'm hoping that the second half of the recording is on the same level.

B00992CF6W|5.0|hey guys, Andrew here! Minecraft PE is an awesome game.bid rather play it on PC cuz it has more, BBBBBBUUUUUUTTTTTT.....this version was probably made for on the go or for long car trips. Ive been waiting for 0.5.0 for a while. They still don't have the version but its an awesome game. A little pricy for quality cuz it doesn't have as much as PC. But in the future, they will probably make it so up to date that it'll have everything PC has in the next couple of years. Awesome game though!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great work bringing to life the struggles of the WWII era, from different points of views. very enjoyable if you read the previous novel. Cant wait for the next one.

B009B4ZEKM|3.0|Normally I find the one-sentence \\"I liked it and that's all\\" type of reviews to be an incredible waste of space on these Amazon product pages, but the truth is there really isn't much TO say about Christina Aguilera's latest offering, Lotus. It's definitely listenable as a whole, though none of the individual tracks really stand out as being too catchy or especially memorable on their own.<br /><br />The album's first single, Your Body, has a good bouncy groove but is instantly forgettable and I doubt I'd be caught humming it to myself later. Other highlights include the rock-tinged Circles, just because I love a really good \\"up yours\\" type of song - but then who doesn't? lol - and Make the World Move with Cee-Lo Green is peppered with some fun lyrics and vocal effects. I wish I could give more praise to the ballads since I feel that's one thing Aguilera has always excelled at, but here she tends to just plain yell the words as opposed to sing them with any kind of melody or grace, and tracks like Blank Page come off as more of a jolting aural assault than a poignant tale of self reflection. She's been accused of over-singing since the beginning of her career, of course, but this is really the first time where I have felt like she's gone way overboard with it.<br /><br />Still, I'm hesitant to label this as a bad CD, even if the moments that reach beyond lukewarm level are few and far between. If anything, it just sounds as though Aguilera simply didn't have anything to say this time around and was only cranking out a low-key, \\"safe\\" album for the sake of meeting some sort of contractual obligation. Her last album, Bionic, disjointed as it was, contained a number of individual tracks that were well crafted in and of themselves, and her Back to Basics outing with its classical influences was a breath of fresh air in the industry at the time. None of that brand of creativity is really present on Lotus. No boundary pushing...no role playing...not even a set theme to play off of. \\"Safe\\" really is the best word I can use to describe it.<br /><br />Does this mean her best days are behind her?

0425263916|5.0|Can't wait for book three. This was an amazing story. Better than fifty shades of gray. The ending of this book was unreal....I am so excited to read book three. Please hurry!
1433523922|5.0|If you are a fan of the ESV version of the Bible - this is an outstanding product!  Print is very easy to read.  Excellent study notes and graphics.  This is not a small Bible - approximately 8&#34; x 10&#34; x 2&#34;, and 3-5 pounds in weight.  You will get stronger just carrying this arround.  Accordingly I use this for desktop / tabletop study, and choose a smaller version to use when traveling.
B001F290E4|5.0|This CD would often be playing in the background when I was visiting at my mother's home, and I was constantly commenting on how much I loved Seal's voice and the songs on the CD.  So much so, in fact, that I just had to have it and purchased one for myself..  Now that I have my own copy, I often listen to it as I'm drifting off to sleep.  It is just great listening music and includes many classic tunes  you will immediately recognize.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|Another great murder mystery by Patricia Cornwell.  I enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed all her previous novels.  Great stuff!
B004V5A7K8|5.0|This is a great, easy to play version of the classic blocks game I grew up with.  Fun, easy to operate and a great way to pass a little time.  Lots of power ups make things interesting.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved this because it moved fast, it kept you trying to figure out where it was going and the characters were very real and full of emotion.  I've been a great fan of Grisham for a long time, but this one could well be his best.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies made.  The story was written back in the 1800's about a family in the 1700's.  its a beautiful love story that everyone in the family can watch.  The acting is superb, the music is lovely as well as the scenery.  Well made.  I never get tired of watching it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show, both Seasons are great! This show is like no other,between the actors and plots, you cannot go wrong. Watch just 1 episode and you will be hooked!

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I was so surprised by the ease and un-frustrating process of purchasing this. One click, then confirmation, and boom, you can watch on your Xbox, (possibly PS3, I'm not sure) iPod or Kindle. I really like Amazon because of that. As for Supernatural Season 8, Episode 1, well, it's awesome, too!
0060555661|5.0|The Intelligent Investor is a book that has withstood the test of time when it comes to the issues faced by investors. Even though things have changed, it offers lessons of very sound judgment for investors at all levels and provides a realistic perception of the uncertainty of the markets. That is why I give this book a 5 star rating.<br /><br />In my opinion this book is extremely helpful for anyone who wants to start or is learning about investing as it dives into the key issues that affect the average investor and seeks to address them in a realistic and concrete way. Graham provides a very structured way to approach investing, giving the investor the tools to better succeed in investing. A major plus for me is the recurring reminder of the risks involved due to the fact that investors are sometimes blinded by the excitement of amazing returns and sometimes end up in less than favorable situations.<br /><br />It must be noted that the reader should be aware of the differences between the market Graham experienced and the one we face today. Although many of the phenomena are similar and the insight is very applicable, some of the examples may not be ideally suited and must be applied to the current situation.<br /><br />This book covers many key topics that are of value to investors. These include the risks of investing, the effect of inflation on investments and how to better protect yourself, and extensive historical examples of market cycles and how they can help to better predict future market performance. Also, security analysis is a key topic discussed in great detail, as it is a topic central to the selection of a sound portfolio. To add to this Graham addresses the attitude of stockholders towards management as he points out \\"[management] asked the shareholders to sacrifice their present interests for the good of the enterprise\\" (Graham 1157 ebook version). Although the examples in the book are decades old, they still hold much truth and value to any investor today.<br /><br />The style and structure of this book is not what I would describe as very light reading (regarding original portion). The book is somewhat dense due to the depth at which the material is covered and the multiple angles taken at each topic analyzing the benefits and risks of each technique/selection presented. The book; however, is highly organized and methodical in its approach which aids the reader in reaching better understanding and facilitates navigation of the text. Ideas are presented in a clear way such that complex ideas are straightforward to understand. The book is also loaded with charts and extensive examples, which help to better illustrate the concepts being presented.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the security analysis portion of the book as it takes each security type and analyses it to a detailed degree outlining additional factors taken into account as well as very detailed information regarding the differences between the analysis for different securities. Also, the fact that there is always a historical example provided, I think allows the reader to better grasp the concepts.<br />To add to the positive factor of this book's variety of examples. As I mentioned before, these examples may not be the most relevant in terms of time due to the fact that when the book was written the values of certain indexes such as the DOW and S&P 500 were very different from what they are today. These examples; however, illustrate many different scenarios that may allow the reader to develop some insight on their own. It is important to see real life examples of many of these concepts. If they were only presented in concepts some of them could be difficult to grasp for some readers.<br /><br />On that same note, the book includes financial terminology that someone with no knowledge of finance may not be familiar with. It is not so extensive as to be overwhelming but it may require some background reading on the part of the reader to ensure fullyunderstanding what is being presented. I would suggest familiarizing yourself with some financial terminologies such as bonds, stocks, some other investments, and their different properties. By doing so, it will be easier to grasp, eliminating the need to stop to search for what terms mean.<br /><br />This is a book that should be read with a highlighter and a notepad. There are many important points that any investor would benefit from noting as well as several sections that could prove useful as reference in future moments. It would be helpful if to have a small summary of the main points at the end of the chapters, but since there isn't one I would suggest jotting down the main points of each chapter thus making it easier to look through at a future time.<br /><br />I believe Benjamin Graham puts it best when he said, \\"Confronted with a like challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto, margin of safety. This is the thread that runs through all the preceding discussion of investment policy - often explicitly, sometimes in a less direct fashion\\" (Graham 1202 ebook version).  This is truly what I think the central concept of this book is. As an investor I think the key goal is to achieve one's goals in terms of return while ensuring one's investments are well protected by a certain margin of safety.<br /><br />In general I think this book is a great tool for anyone looking to enter the realm of investing. I would highly recommend it to anyone regardless of his or her level of experience. It is a book that can truly change the way you invest to make you a more intelligent investor and allowing you to better reach your investment goals while mitigating as much risk as is possible. The Intelligent Investor is a book that I believe should always be the first tool in an investor's tool kit as it provides the necessary foundations for sound investing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|you're requiring too much info, particularly for an average or above rating.  I won't be rating anymore products unless I really dislike something - that should give you a clue as to why you have more negative than positive ratings - and these are just on games, I'll probably never rate any books!
B0070XB0N6|5.0|This is one of my very favorite books by one of my favorite writers, Neil Gaiman!  Also beautifully illustrated.  It's great!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. However, some of the lists of people who did various things was a bit boring. If I hadn't wanted to find out what happened to the individuals, I would have quit reading it.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I would recommend this exciting book to anyone who loves historical fiction.  War,greed,sex,fabulous narrative. a winning combination.  buy it now!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham hides enough details of the revenge plot to make this a pretty good page-turner. Not overly,complicated, it makes a very good concourse or in-flight read on a Kindle.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I'm pleased with this album because they've returned to their original sound. At last, once again power on their music.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|can connect to steam chat and can check deals on the steam store. if your computer is on you can make a purchase and it will start downloading at home. quite handy as steams IM client is closed and proprietary,
B000SEIK2S|3.0|I loved the premise and first half of OMW, but I thought the last half stopped breaking new ground, and fell back on cliched military experiences.  Aliens became too human, and the military ops were also familiar.  I had hopes the introduction of Ghost Brigade troops would boost the last half, but that left me flat as well.<br />I think &#34;Forever War&#34; and &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; did it better!<br />That said, do check out Scalzi's &#34;Redshirts&#34;, it's an amazing read!
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I love this album. Having said that I understood from reading other reviews before I purchased it that it is not typical Diana Krall style. I agree with some of the other reviewers that she doesn't seem to put quite as much feeling into the music as many of the original artists, but still, it's a great collection, and a nice change of pace too add to her already significant catalog.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another page turner from John Grisham. If you're already a fan you won't be disappointed and if this is your first Grisham novel you have many more to enjoy. Enough new twists that you aren't likely to figure this one out until the final chapter.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This historical novel is very well written, interesting, educational and pleasurable.<br />I am into the second book of the trilogy and will be sad to finish.<br />A great read.
B009PEPML4|3.0|despite other reviews, I'm not super impressed with this release. don't get me wrong, I love GYBE, but this album is no Lift Yer Skinny Fists... I keep listening to it hoping it will grab me, but it hasn't. I'm not saying its a horrible piece of crap either. Its really not bad. I just don't agree with other reviewers who loved it. Its completely personal and subjective and this one just didn't do it for me.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My kids and I have enjoyed all the Diaries so far so after school today I bought this for them to read over the long holiday weekend.<br /><br />Buyer Beware - it may not load onto any non-Kindle devices you have!  I got it to load onto my Kindle, finally, but that's my baby.  It wouldn't load on our HP tablets, which is how I wanted them to be able to read it.  Now I have to surrender my Kindle until they've all finished with the book.  It's still a great book.  Just take care to make sure you can load it onto whatever device you want to read it on - especially if that's not a Kindle.

B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is one of the best movies that tells it like it is when families get together for the holidays and the in-laws really do not like each other.  It is funny yet warm and in the end shows the true meaning of getting along for the holidys.
0547884591|5.0|As someone who loves nutrition and health, I am always looking for ways to make my meals delicious and creative, while not completely overwhelming myself in the kitchen.  This book is my answer!  Tim has not missed anything...kitchen equipment, detailed pictures of everything (even the ingredients) and his humor and hysterical personality in ever page.  I highly recommend this book as a staple item in your kitchen.<br /><br />I am giving several family members a copy for Christmas.  I know they are absolutely going to love it!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Wow.  Wheddon is the Man!  What a great movie.  Enjoyed it from start to finish.  Watched it 2x so far and liked it just as much.  RDJr chews up the scenes he is in and Mark Ruffalo wasn't bad as the big green guy.  About laughed to death when I first saw the hulk/loki encounter in stark tower.  And the post credits stuff sent a chill down my spine.  Can't wait to see what happens with old prune face.  The effects are brilliant and super impressive.  Don't have a 3d tv but very impressive in just regular blu-ray.
1451695195|1.0|This book could have been so much more, and wasn't. While reading this thing, it reminded me of going to a cocktail party where you meet a new person that looks interesting. He begins to talk, and after 20 or so minutes of his recounting every minute detail of a life that is only interesting to him, you realize that you are not part of the equation whatsoever. Your role is simply to listen to him yammer on and on. Everything is essentially about him and his image of himself and will always be just that.<br /><br />There are many, many, writers who have written numerous books on the different levels of the Astral world. For a first time reader, who has never heard anything about the worlds just behind all of our lives, it must have been interesting to read about a portion of those experiences through the eyes of a person who is respected in this country as a hero. A physican, and an accomplished one.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as happens sometimes when someone is very good at what they do, in this case brain surgery, the person never gets beyond their own hype and spends lots of time looking in the mirror, continually repeating what a good boy am I, and no one can disagree.<br /><br />While reading the book, it was obvious that this man is not an author. But, who knows, it may be helpful to him to have written it, and if he were to see beyond his current role in this play of life, he would see how much more he really experienced and integrate that knowledge into who he really is.  It would really make his NDE all that it could have been.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|An evolution album for sure, I like the wide variety.  Of course I'm a geezer who enjoys Duran Duran and several songs have that 80's style feel.  I also like the dubstep and resistance and madness are both classic Muse.  I've listened thru this about 4 or 5 times at least and enjoy it each time.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This was such a pleasure to view the entire season at once.  The action was nonstop and phenomenal acting.  I highly recommend this DVD>
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent series, script, acting, location, storyline...exceeded all my expectations. I am already looking forward to season 3, as I´m sur eit will be as good as seasons 1 and 2.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Definitely not Aliens or Aliens2, but worthwhile watching as a prelude. 9 more words, 9 more words, 9 more words.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is INCREDIBLY fast-paced!!! While the program borrows elements of the prison/Woodsbury storyline from the comic, it takes a very different approach on the material. Must-see TV!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great quality, 100% recommended! I love it =)
B007N85ZXY|4.0|I was very, very reluctant to even listen to this album. much less purchase it. I mean, come on; covers of weary old standards like \\"Oh Susannah,\\" \\"Clementine\\", \\"This Land is Your Land,\\" and even \\"God Save the Queen\\"??? What was Neil thinking --- or drinking --- when he came up with this hackneyed concept? Well, I take it all back. What an idiot I was not to have seen the genius in this idea: this is a terrific album! I seriously thought of giving it 5 stars, simply because I enjoy it so much, but I'm holding back for fear that I won't love it as much in a couple of more months. But right now, this ranks as one of my favorites of the year. This is not even close to being an \\"ordinary\\" Neil Young album; this is special stuff. The secret ingredient of course is Crazy Horse. Neil plays his butt off as usual, but it's that special chemistry --- or cosmic energy --- of him and the band merging together that really make this album tick. Listen to the radical arrangements of these old standards; this is brilliant, inventive stuff. I never thought I would enjoy \\"Oh Susannah\\" or \\"God Save the Queen\\" but Neil and Crazy Horse make these sedate songs rip and rumble and rock. Those trademark crunchy guitars are in abundance, leaving the Crazy Horse imprint on each and every tune. One of my favorite tunes on here is \\"Jesus' Chariot\\" which I know as \\"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain.\\" Whoa! When that tune gets rolling you feel like your hair is on fire, having been singed by those flaming guitars. Listening to this album, it strikes me as the most FUN sounding one that Neil has made in many, many years. But this time around the lyrics have extra meaning too. Enjoy this remarkable album, but don't forget the message.
B009VB97EY|2.0|would not buy it. Bad movie!!!! Would not rent it again!!! One of the worst movies we have seen on Azamon!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book has a moral srory to it and of you read it you will find out what it is like i did
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have always liked DeMiles's books, but in his John Cory series, although I find them readable, the wisecracks of Cory throughout the book are distracting and take away from the mood. They just don't have the polish of &#34;The Gold Coast&#34; or the General's Daughter.&#34; etc. I'm still a DeMIlle fan, and I am likely to remain so, but I do wish he would lighten up Cory  a bit.
B007U4DB4G|5.0|Muy bien realizada y divertida. Apta para pasar un buen rato en familia. Recomiendo ampliamente. Las peliculas 1 y 2 son igualmente buenas
0553582038|2.0|After reading the first three books I was disappointed by how this book barely moves the main story forward.  The characters that kept me wanting to read more--Tyrion, Arya, Bran, Stannis, Jon--are barely mentioned.  The writer knew many of his fans would feel let down, as indicated in his epilogue.  One thing I did enjoy was seeing the other side of Jaime, who became one of my favorite characters. But, as far as I'm concerned, most of the book is a self-indulging dragging out of the story and a grating tease. I'm holding off before committing to book 5.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This is not the best of John Grisham. It seems written in a hurry and written from the knowledge off the top  his head. In many cases I found the scenes not believable. His characters are believable and interesting and the story will keep your interest but as the story moves to its closure I found it less and less plausible. In the end thee book was written by a very successful author who knows he can write a novel and have it sell because of his name. Even Grisham himself in his afterwards admits as much.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good read kept up my interest throughout and great ending a good detailed read I would recommend this to all avid readers
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Ian Mcewan is an excellent writer and this book is another example. It was easy to read. The plot is a little complicated but I thought it was easily followed. The scene is 1973 and the MI5 hires young women as entry level members and one in particular is recruited to trick an aspiring writer into writing his own books about topics that interests him. He is supported by MI5 but he does not know that. The young lady falls in love with the writer and her superior at MI5 turns jealous when he finds out. The book is written in the first person from the gals perspective. Normally, when a male authour write from a female perspective it never rings true. This also true when a female writer from a male perspective. But McEwan pulls it off rather well. At least I think he did. The last 100 pages were the best as she is on edge about to tell her lover everything and the whole thing starts to unravel. Just when you want to know how she is going to handle her dilemma, the story get handled in a way that is not foreseen.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This season was well thought out just like all the others.<br />Dean and Sam what I love about them is they decided to stay together and fight evil to find their father.<br />I would recommend this series for anyone who loves the paranormal.<br />BTW their shipping for any of these DVDs are excellent, none of mine have came broken or damaged.
B00992CF6W|5.0|buy it its really fun if your string to play. with someone you have to play with the same wifi
B0039SFKSW|5.0|In todays world of idol x-factoring ballyhoo, these guys just do it the old fashioned way.-by doing live what they do in the studio with no gimmicks. A great work featuring their stellar talents. Every song here is a winner and definately no fillers. (Ha ha) But do see them live if you get the chance, you wont regret it.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I was 5 when Zeppelin broke up.  I suspect that each person and each generation that discovers Led Zeppeling discovers it their own way.  For me, it was the very early 1990s, near the end of high school, when I started tiring of the Top 40 play list.  In those days in Los Angeles, there were two revered rock stations: 95.5 KLOS and 97.1 KLSX (one is still there).  With call letters like KLSX, what do you think they played? Yup, Classic Rock.  It might be me, but classic rock stations those many years ago seemed to play a larger variety of rock than the Clear Channel-controlled rock stations of today.  Anyway, the famed DJ Jim Ladd used to spin dreamlike sequences of rock tunes that, if I did drugs, seemed like the perfect companion for a drug-induced haze.  In these sequences, he oftened played Zeppelin's In The Light.  From that, I was hooked.  Those early 90s were the years that the first remastered Zeppelin 4-CD box set was just released, and when I went to college, I used to stalk the local record stores' used section for those CDs.  After several months of trying, I did end up with all 4 CDs.  I treasure them to this day, not because I play those specific CDs anymore, but they are like a time capsule for me, transporting me way back to those late high school and college days.  Together with back catalogs of The Who and Peter Gabriel, Zeppelin took me through those years; they are fused with the story and memories of my life.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2007 (married now, with kids and a house in the suburbs), and the revelation that Zeppelin (with John Bonham's son Jason) would do a reunion with a possibility of a world tour sent me into a dreamlike sequence.  Needless to say, I wasn't in the audience for this show, but in the days that followed, I (probably like thousands and thousands of folks everywhere) hunted down every uploaded Youtube clip I could find.  The reviews of the show in the press made it seem like a resounding success, but one really couldn't tell from those sparse clips.  It's just hard to shake the uneasy feeling that they might have botched their legacy.  After all, the 1990s No Quarter reunion record and tour, while blockbusters (and I did have that CD on repeat through many, many hours of college studying), are pretty mediocre now that I listen back--Plant's voice was hoarse and thin, and Page/Plant re-arranged some of their classic songs in unseemly ways.  And I also have Page and Plant's followup record, Walking Into Clarksdale, which was a disaster all around.<br /><br />So despite all the strong reviews of that reunion show, I had lots of trepidation when I first put in the Bluray into my 5.1 big screen home theater (you really do need one of these to truly enjoy it).  Within the first 3 songs, my unease and anxiety had melted away.  Plant's voice is strong, deep, and more expressive than maybe ever.  His maturation through his years as a solo artist in his many projects have brought a worldliness and emotive-ness that he never had when he was in his 20s.  His goatee and deep wrinkles--when you're able to see them through his still-golden and curly locks--reflect his age and brings weight to what he sings.  Page...he probably looked oldest of the bunch with thoroughly white hair.  But his playing is more precise and concise than ever before, and that's to the benefit to these songs.  The arrogant showmanship of his youth is gone, replaced by a more humble posture that is more endearing.  John Paul Jones--who looks the most trim and \\"young\\" of the 3 original members--moves deftly between the bass and keys.  He completes the chemistry that was lacking in the Page/Plant projects of the 90s.  He was what was missing in those 90s tours.  They need him.  And Jason Bonham...I'm so very glad they kept it all in the family.  Jason has grown up and looks even beefier than his dad, and it shows in his playing.  I read that he practiced hard--really hard--for this show.  But he shows a looseness and comfortwith Page, Plant, and Jones that makes it all feel...GOOD.  Oh so very good.<br /><br />There is none of the bloat and indulgence of 30-min songs with meandering guitar and drum solos that they were (in)famous for in the 70s (e.g. The Song Remains the Same movie).  No, they tear through these tunes almost uniformly with precision and forward momentum.  The arrangements are familiar, but with small tweaks in places that give the ear something fresh to hook onto--you need this after listening to the same album tracks and 70s bootlegs for the 500th time.  Whether you buy the Bluray or \\"just\\" the DVD package, you owe it to yourself to see the footage; the audio CDs by themselves don't do the show justice.  You need to see and feel these guys playing.  You need to see them in their older, white-haired, wrinkled selves as they pound out these historic songs with the alacrity and power of but greater confidence than their younger selves.  You need to see the interplay between them, the glances and smiles to each other, their solidarity when they hunker down around Jason's drum kit.<br /><br />Some here have commented that the Deluxe package with the Bluray, DVD with rehearsal footage, and audio CDs is unnecessary.  But I heartily disagree--for the low price of $32 (at the time of this writing), you get everything in a trim CD-sized package at a bargain price.  They could have easily put out a lavish box and charged many times that price, but didn't.  If you're anything more than a casual Zeppelin fan, you'll *want* the Deluxe set.<br /><br />And, yes, they play Stairway.  Sublimely, at that.  After the audience chants along with Plant those famous last few words of the legendary track, Plant looks up toward the ceiling of the arena and utters, \\"Hey Ahmet, we did it.\\"  And surely, they did.  I'm rather glad now that Zeppelin did this one show, and that's it.  These Bluray/DVD/CDs capture that one, magnificant night when the world stopped for 2 hours,  turned their attentionto these guys, and watched them do their thing.  After watching this show, I know now that Zeppelin will never tour again, and they will never put any new material.  This is it.  Their legacy is secure.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Individually they are great musicians, collectively an overwhelmingly great sounding band. I am no expert by any means but the music on XXX certainly hits the mark in my opinion.
1476712042|4.0|OK so here is the overview -<br /><br />The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn't drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University's Walking One-Night Stand.<br /><br />Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby wants--and needs--to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby's resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis's apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.<br /><br />Now here is my review -<br /><br />Mmmm mmm mmm....what good girl doesn't love a bad boy. Lol. I LOVED this book. Now, I'm DYING to get an autogaphed copy! If you want one too, it can be pre-ordered at Barnes and Noble.<br /><br />Ok enough promotion lol. There has been a lot of talk about a movie...and I know this isn't exactly a review of the book, BUT - if anyone has seen the Maroon 5 video for One More Night - HE is how I picture Travis Maddox! All tattooed and yummy!<br /><br />Ok, NOW my true review - I loved it, I didn't like the somewhat dysfunctional relationship Abby and Travis had at first...and it was a little tiresome all the ups and downs...I wanted to scream at them and say, \\"JUST BE TOGETHER ALREADY! Everyone else knows it's going to happen...so just let it.\\"<br /><br />However, I did like how complex the characters were. I liked the multiple story lines, I kind of wish we could see more of Travis' roommate and Abby's friend's story...but it looks like there may be a follow up and will be a series - so I can't wait to see what the author brings in next for the crazy lovebirds.<br /><br />This is my first read of any of the authors titles and I have to say that I have now founds a new favorite author!next for the crazy lovebirds.<br /><br />This is my first read of any of the authors titles and I have to say that I have now founds a new favorite author!
B009LUBA7M|5.0|This is the BEST album he's done so far!! I have been telling EVERYONE I know they HAVE to listen to it!! Please buy it and spread the word!!!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is the only movie that has ever made me want to purchase the DVD as soon as I left the theater.
1400069289|4.0|I liked the book. It was an easy read with lots of examples. I am curious to see if I can change some old or create some new habits of my own.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I love games that are mysteries - finding objects within.<br />But why is it that you can only play so far and then have to purchase them - other games are totally free.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of his best , however I think every new one is the best. All his books keep me mystified as I read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The one bad thing about any post apocalypse zombie film is the time limit. (it ends)  Walking Dead has already established itself in the world of zombie-lore and it's not even near over. (I can hope and pray)  There are a thousand things I can think of for a zombie movie or series that I would like to see but I can't complain at all about the writers for this show.  Keep it up!
146500632X|5.0|of course the guys are hot, what else can you say?? LOL!! great pics and of course everyone needs a calendar...why not 1 of 5 hot guys you can look at every day??
B008BDZOZY|4.0|Back in the day, Talking Head was an acquired taste.  Once I acquired it, however, I couldn't get enough.  This new album by David Byrne & Annie St. Vincent is excellent.  You won't be disappointed.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|just like in the 80s, that was me with the nkotb shirt @ the nkotb concert screaming my head off!!:)  the 1D concert was very good, it was like you're right there in the arena!! the only critique i have is it was a lil' hard understanding the guys when they're talking in the extras and in between songs...their accents are so thick. (but who cares, i like it!)<br /><br />if you haven't had a chance to see 1D in concert, i agree with the other fans, this is the next best thing. to all of you seeing them on their tour..you're gonna have a blast!! and you'll never forget the concert!! i still remember the nkotb concert just like it was yesterday.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The story line was great, kept the gore and surprise of a zombie horror but added personal accounts to make it realistic.
0785152458|4.0|I loved the first series. One of the coolest stories I've read in recent times.<br /><br />However, this seemed to lack some of the magic. While the first series felt more human, and gave me more of an emotional impact. This was just over the top and seemed to go more for shock value. In addition, John Romita Jr,'s art seemed VERY inconsistent. At times he draws Hit-Girl as if she is 8 or 9 years old. Then other times she looks like she is 4 or 5 years old! Maybe he was rushing, or was working on a lot of projects at the time. But either the way the art was not as good or as consistent as the first series.<br /><br />Still overall, it was entertaining and a good read. Just not a 'GREAT' one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|!!!Don't buy any add-ons or games from Vicky!  This is the real game,  hers is marketed as real for less $$$ but they don't play. Check and make sure you buy from Mojang and get the REAL<br />game that works, it is an awesome game!
0785156593|5.0|I grew up on the comics of the 80's and 90's.  I remember reading this back then and being blown away. Reading it again brought back those memories.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Corey is back and he is the old wise guy, but even more! The book is very talky, very informative about Arab culture, etc., but too much so at times. But both my husband and I laughed out loud at his wise-guy remarks. What a character! Long book, worth the $$$!
B003O86FMW|4.0|As the continuing saga of ,“The Hunger Games\\" goes it was interesting.  The image was very creative and held my attention.

B002QBS9KE|5.0|These eartips are great, fit perfectly, very good quality, and good size, improves sound planatronics voyaguer. the three eartips are the same size
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Let me just start off by saying that Lana Del Rey is quite the gifted singer and talented songwriter. As with her past album Born To Die, all songs on this one are written by Lana herself (with the exception of Blue Velvet, which is a cover of Lee Morris' popular 1950 jazz song) and sung in her unique and \\"different\\" voice that's given the public so much to talk about.<br /><br />The diction in Lana's songwriting is interesting and very beautiful, and she certainly has an ability to evoke powerful imagery if you take the time to actually pay attention to her lyrics instead of \\"just listening to her beautiful seductive voice,\\" which many people just seem to do.<br /><br />That being say, it is important to note that Paradise, while captivating and mesmerizing, does NOT have the more upbeat songs that Born To Die had. Nothing even remotely similar to Off To The Races, Diet Mountain Dew, or Lolita is found on here. If you're thinking of buying this in hopes of more tracks like that, then you might be disappointed. Although you might not, as the songs on Paradise are just as morbid and wonderful. But they are considerably darker in content, much slower, much more eerie, and even more depressing (and I mean that in a good way!) All in all, this EP is just darker and more mature in its tone.<br /><br />(Oh, and on the off chance that you haven't heard her massive hit \\"Video Games,\\" let me assure you that yes, her voice is indeed what most people would deem as \\"angelic\\".)<br /><br />Lastly, just a heads up: If you download the Paradise on itunes, it comes with a bonus song titled Burning Desire. If you're a hardcore Lana fan, you've probably already heard it and yes, it's a very lovely song but I do think Paradise is complete without it and can be enjoyed without that track. And if you're purchasing this at Target, know that it comes with 2 remixes of Blue Velvet, which I honestly found utterly unnecessary and pointless. Also, remember you can purchase what's called \\"Born To Die: The Paradise Edition\\", which is just Born To Die and Paradise put together. Obviously, this is only good in case you don't already have Born To Die, but if you're planning on buying Paradise because you liked Born To Die, then chances are that you probably already have Born To Die.  If not, then go for it.  You save money.<br /><br />The tracklist is as follows. I have included a little description of each song, as well as my opinions.<br /><br />1. Ride - Lana sings about how taking a ride in her car at midnight helps her escape her problems. Good choice as the lead single, sets an appropriate tone and mood for the whole CD. Up to par with \\"Born To Die\\" and \\"Video Games.\\" My favorite line: \\"Dying young and playing hard, that's the way my father made his life an art.\\"<br /><br />2. American - Lana sings about what it means to be an American. I love the shout outs to Bruce Springsteen and Elvis on this one, as well as the \\"dope\\" chorus. (Once you listen to it, you'll know what I mean). Admittedly though, this is my least favorite track on here but for no particular reason. Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful song and I'd still give it an A. It's just that if this is an A, then the  others are all A+s.  All in all, Lana is pretty much singing about what Lana Del Rey knows the best about: being a proud American and riding fast and being crazy.<br /><br />3. Cola - Ahh, the reason why this has a huge EXPLICIT sticker slapped on the front. The controversial opening line of this song is quite the attention grabber, especially because Lana sings it with a seductive jazzy voice: \\"My p**** tastes like Pepsi Cola.\\" It's controversial but not just for the sake of being controversial, for I interpret the song as talking about an affair (\\"I know your wife and she wouldn't mind\\") and Lana is trying to convince this man to \\"escape to the great sunshine\\" with her.  The opening line is Lana's way of persuading the man, I think. That's just my interpretation and I could verypossibly be wrong.  But believe it or not, this song is actually quite lovely, beautiful, and even romantic. It's in my top 3 and not because of that line, but because you really get to hear Lana's voice range and the chorus is catchy.<br /><br />4. Body Electric - An awesome morbid little song this one is... If you're looking to introduce a friend to Lana Del Rey, show them this song. This is Lana's songwriting at its best and the lyrics are interesting, to say the least.  \\"Elvis is my daddy. Marilyn's my mother. Jesus is my bestest friend. [...] Heaven is my baby. Suicide's her father. Opulence is the end.\\" Perfect song for a dark day or a rainy night.  Additionally, the way Lana sings the chorus is disturbingly haunting and it's big.  Yes, the chorus delivery is big and grand, if that makes any sense.  It resonates in your head like an echo.<br /><br />5. Blue Velvet - Not much to say on this one. Like stated above, it's a cover of a popular 1950s song. Lana did an amazing job and does the original justice. Only shame is that it's too darn short, but her voice is very jazzy in this one, more so than in the other ones.  Something about the song itself and Lana's unique voice just makes them perfect for each other.<br /><br />6. Gods and Monsters - God, I love this one! It's also in my top 3. A very well written and clever song that showcases Lana's ability as a songwriter yet again. I think it also does a good job at evoking that paradise imagery and symbolism that gives the CD its name. (Or rather, a dark and screwed-up paradise with no God to look after it). A lot of good lines in this one. One particularly powerful line that really jumped out at me: \\"In a land of gods and monsters, I was an angel looking to get f***** hard. Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer, life imitates art...\\" The instruments here are very dark too and certainly set a mood if you're listening to this with earphones or headphones.<br /><br />7. Yayo - I would argue this is one of Lana's most powerful songs thus far in her professional career. This is actually a song from her pre-Lana Del Rey days - back when she wasn't as famous as she is now and was still going by her real name, Lizzy Grant. It was a surprise and a joy to many fans finding out that Lana re-recorded this song and included it here. Some people don't seem to like this version too much (because you supposedly can't even understand what she's singing,  although I can understand what Lana is singing perfectly fine) and claim to prefer the \\"Lizzy Grant version\\" over it.  I, however, like this version better and think it's more haunting, melancholic, and impacting. Melancholic is actually a very good word to describe the sound of this track.  It's very sad and blue and reminds me of a depressed young bride on her wedding day.  I have no idea why but it does! I will admit though that if you're trying to get a friend into Lana, this might not be the best song to use because, hands down, it's honestly the slowest song on the whole disc. By far. Very, very slow! But if you're into songs like this like I am, it's perfection.  Given the lyrics, I can't imagine the song fast paced.  It's slowness becomes it and suits it well.<br /><br />8. Bel Air - In my top 3. It's actually my #1 favorite song on the whole disc. Definitely a cinematographic track. Very haunting. Imagery very powerful, talking about gargoyles and Heaven and love and death and Bel Air and roses and heartbreak and seeing the nostalgic outline of palm trees in the night. I hear it's the next single? I'm praying that this is true! Be warned though, just like Yayo, this is also a slow song (though nowhere near as slow as Yayo). But it's beautiful. This is the type of song I'll put on repeat next to my bedside so I can fall asleep to it.  And to be honest, I'm not even entirely sure what this song is about.  Certain parts of it make it seem like it's about wanting to be reunited with your loved one in Heaven.  I'm not exactly sure but regardless, it is - for lack of a better word - simply beautifully sung.  A very emotional track.  There is a lot of vocal layering to create a \\"chorus\\" effect, but it's not annoying and, for those of you wondering, I don't it should complicate live performances of the song.  \\"Gargoyles stating in front of the gate, trying to tell me to wait but I can't wait to see you.  So I run like a child to Heaven's door.  I don't wanna be bad, I won't cheat you no more...\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, if you liked Lana's first album you'll more than likely like Paradise too, so long as you didn't like Born To Die exclusively for the catchier and more danceable songs. After all, Paradise is essentially intended to be a continuation of Born To Die. A part two. The tracks here are more similar to songs like Born To Die, Carmen, Without You, and Summertime Sadness, Blue Jeans, Million Dollar Man, etc.  I recommend reading the lyrics booklet as you listen to the tracks.  You'll appreciate the poetry of it all even more.<br /><br />Once again, my favorite songs here are \\"Bel Air\\", \\"Cola\\", and \\"Gods and Monsters\\". Highly recommend it, especially if you're not exactly a Lana Del Rey fan but want to try out her music. This is a good introduction to the type of music she sings and the type of music she writes.

B003VANOFY|3.0|The microphone works perfect and I love the idea that you can bend the mic easily to adjust the sound intensity and the fact that you can mute it just by raising the mic straight up. Its weight is considerably light knowing it is a wireless gaming headset. The sound works fine in most case since I keep hearing broken radio noise when playing some youtube videos which is unheard when I switch to different headset and/ or using inbuilt speakers (I am using a laptop). Since I am using a laptop, the size of the wireless adapter is rather too big, a little bit longer than the standard USB/ flash drive. One thing that I really hate is the time taken to turn off the headset (approximately 7 seconds) and the fact you have to press and hold the button is way too obnoxious. They should have applied a switch system rather than holding the button.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book gives the reader an understanding of the Outstanding men that serve as Navy Seals and the incredible commitment they have to our country and to doing the &#34;greater good&#34;.  While it is great to hear about the raid on Bin Laden, the real story is the Navy Seals and their commitment and professionalism. They are the real heroes of our country. The reader gives a great first person account of his background, training, and the teamwork that develops as they grow as individuals and as a team. Every American should read this book so they can better appreciate the people who serve in the military and understand the special commitment of the Navy Seals. The writer tells a good story and provides and balanced, human perspective. He shares some of the positive and the negatives. It is a good story with an important message.

B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Requires too much work to complete the task.  Too stressful.  I couldn't figure some of the screens out.  Not fun for me.  I didn't enjoy this game.
B008SVS0K0|5.0|If you've been eagerly awaiting BT's next release because their first three albums are in constant rotation on your playlists, you're going to love Dead Silence.<br /><br />  Now, if you've somehow missed Billy Talent over the past ten years, it's not really your fault if you live in the U.S.. BT doesn't neatly fit into the corporate rock niche that the labels and radio stations want to promote. So surprise, surprise (cue track 3 on Dead Silence), sometimes you have to really dig to find the (music) gems. Once you've sampled a few tracks from Billy Talent's new album you'll know you're onto something.<br /><br />  Dead Silence is not a departure from the sound and feeling of the three previous studio releases, it is more an evolution from those. It truly feels like a concept album that somehow manages to take varying styles and themes and meld them together with that signature, addicting Billy Talent sound. There are no \\"throwaway\\" tracks- every one gets the band's full effort in songwriting, energy, and production.<br /><br />  The guys in BT have been together for 20 years as a band, and with Dead Silence they've once again proven they have lost none of their passion for the music.

I would not recommend this book to a novice because it tends toward the technical side, but for the more advanced student, I think it is something every artist should own.
B008G59IKO|5.0|this album, dos, has a very good beat to it, very catchy, has a very mellow, but ticked off at the world beat, also has some 50s sounds to some of the songs, like \\"amy\\" love it all , cant wait until the last album in the series comes out

B0064SHI9I|5.0|I bought this when I got a new Android phone.  backing up everything to the microSD card on the old phone, then restoring it on the new phone worked very well.  It didn't seem to back up the arrangement of my home screens, but otherwise everything was there.  You have several options of what to back up too.  I still use it to create backups.

My version updated, but no way to update hers, and now we can't hook up becuase we have 2 different versions (servers). Someone told me She would have to delete her version, and buy the latest one. Not sure if this is the case yet but certainly not doing that over and over again.

0547884591|5.0|I read an advance copy of the book. My overall assessment is simple: if you're at all interested in cooking, it's impossible to imagine you *not* getting massive value out of this masterpiece, far beyond whatever you paid for it.<br /><br />And honestly, even if you're not that interested in cooking, it's still going to rock you, if you start getting into it. It's \\"the book about cooking for people who aren't that interested in cooking.\\" Which is probably a large part of Tim's audience--people (like me) who just aren't naturally that interested in cooking. For me, that all changed, reading this book.<br /><br />Part of what Tim does in this book is get you to see how cooking real, delicious, healthy, accomplished, and even seductive meals, could be a part of your daily or at least weekly life, even if you're just not that keen on the idea. And without much expenditure of time. He's a master persuader, and this time, he has trained his persuasion skills onto persuading the I-don't-have-time-to-cook-and-I-don't-want-to-anyway person (aka, me, and much of America), that in fact, real cooking is within our realm, with not that much effort or time.<br /><br />Tim's persuasion in the book consists, surprise surprise, in applying his famous 80/20 principle, which he has applied to endeavors as diverse as tango dancing, running a business, and learning a language. This time, he applies the same proven thought-process, taking the kitchen as his object. He shows you to get 80% of the value of being a master chef, with 20% of the effort. This 80/20 methodology is Tim's speciality, and he delivers as promised here.<br /><br />Flipping through the book, it's impossible to avoid the conclusion that he put an *insane* amount of work into it. Like years and years worth of obsessive research. It's evident on every page. Which means, we don't have to do that work ourselves. For the price of a book, we get the benefit of all that obsession, distilled down to only the most actionable and valuable nuggets we can actually use.<br /><br />This book is no doubt going to be a bestseller, which means, hundreds of thousands or millions of people will now be exposed and inspired by the idea that real, satisfying, low-stress cooking is available at home, for not that much time or money. If only a percentage of readers take this message to heart and act, there could be real shifts in the food culture of America. After years of take-out mediocrity for lunch and dinner among the middle class and even the upper class, we may just be on the verge of a home-cooked revolution which will have positive implications on health for millions. If that happens, it will all stem from this wise, iconoclastic book with its elegantly persuasive, over-the-top impressive, actionable content.<br /><br />There's just no way this book could disappoint you if you're curious about cooking (for health, taste, convenience, weight loss, or for any other goal. Tim's tour de force here is to traditional cookbooks what a MacBook Air is to a typewriter. Avalable for the price of a book.<br /><br />I recommend buying the hardcover over the Kindle, as the book is rich with lush illustrations through out. It's an elegantly laid-out, colorful book which is best appreciated in hardcover.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have long been a fan of Victor Hugo and of this work and can never get enough of it. It is much better to read the book than say watching the movies or listening to the musical soundtrack. One of the things that I love about reading the book is how all the characters are interrelated somehow. This is a lengthy work, but well worth the time invested in reading it.
0547884591|5.0|Tim's books have helped me start my own business (work week), lose 15 pounds (body) and I know the domestic, wild and the equipment guides will come in super handy from the 4 hour chef. Here's the thing--most chefs have only themselves to rely on in their books. Tim speaks to a ton of people here (dozens) and aggregates a lot of their knowledge into one tome. Will it replace a set of other traditional cookbooks? No. But that's not really the point. The point here is that Tim does his homework, and treats his subject matter as an obsessive. $20. Worth it.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Starting in the world of E-books. I really had nothing to go by, so this helps. My only issue is that most of the advice is for using Microsoft Word and I use open office. I want to add a table of contents to my ebook, but the advice for word doesn't carry over for the program I use.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|One of my most favorite books of all time. Simply fantastic in every way. Please revisit this world Mr. Gaiman.
1609611543|5.0|The book was recommend by a friend, I read the book and the friend is still a friend!.  I enjoyed the book and have modified my diet to go &#34;wheatless&#34;  Thus far in three weeks, I have lost three pounds.  Book is very interesting and enjoyed the history and chemistry of our new &#34;improved&#34; wheats.

B009MF56GC|5.0|WARNING: If you did not like the first EXPENDABLES, or had no desire to see it, or do not like cliched 80's action films, you will NOT enjoy THE EXPENDABLES 2.  Just so you know.<br /><br />I'm not going to recite any plot points here; the plot makes absolutely no sense.  Something about uranium and a villain (named Vilain, yup), and our gang of lovable misfits gets in the way, losing  one of their own in the process (and not much surprise who gets it, either).  Stallone decides that it's payback time (\\"Find 'em, track 'em, kill 'em\\"), and the boys team up with some other major muscle-bound Neanderthals to take their vengeance.  Oh, and save the world or something.<br /><br />Here are the negative things about THE EXPENDABLES 2: Jason Statham's presence is smaller (though still prominent), which cuts down on the chemistry between him and Stallone that helped make the first film so enjoyable.  Same with Jet Li.  Also, Randy Couture is back; he's likable, but he doesn't have nearly as much screen presence as his comrades (though he's better here than in the first film).<br /><br />Now, here are the good things, or at least some of them: the film is hilarious.  Absolutely hilarious.  Chuck Norris reciting a Chuck Norris fact hilarious (and yes, Norris, as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis, have significant screen time here).  It's almost a parody, without going over-the-top in the way of AIRPLANE! and NAKED GUN.  It's as much an homage to the classic actioner as anything, right down to its two-dimensional villain: Jean-Claude Van Damme, riding an impressive (if shallow) career comeback.  Van Damme isn't mind-blowing amazing, but damn if he doesn't bring a sly sinister something to the role (as well as an impressive physicality).  Scott Adkins is a welcome addition to the villainous side, while Nan Yu provides a femme fatale presence, and Liam Hemsworth brings some surprising depth to the role of a rookie sniper.  Also, Dolph Lundgren is back with a larger role (and even a small nod to the fact he actually has a Master's in chemical engineering, if you can swallow that).  Stallone hands over directing credit to Simon West, who's proven his action worth with CON AIR and THE MECHANIC, and the change is welcome: West lets loose a little more, plays the game with more attention to wit and humor.  (Scenes between Willis and Schwarzenegger are particularly delightful.)<br /><br />The true draw of THE EXPENDABLES 2 is to see all of these icons in one place, doing their thing, pretty much as bad (take that how you will) as ever.  It's truly an enjoyable film; it really is.  It's intentionally funny--I've rarely seen a theater laugh so hard--and yet doesn't skimp on the action at all.  Perhaps it puts too much weight on some people not known for their acting prowess--again, Statham, who actually CAN act when required, is sorely missed in certain scenes--but that's okay, because just as soon as you begin to question how these people got into this business, Chuck Norris emerges and saves the day.  The gist: If you love class action movies, and I mean love them so much you can't help but admire even the \\"bad\\" ones, then THE EXPENDABLES 2 is a must-have for your testosterone-fueled collection.role (and even a small nod to the fact he actually has a Master's in chemical engineering, if you can swallow that).

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Disappointing story line as have been the last few books by Mr. Grisham. I recently re-read a Scott Turow book and there was no comparison as the story line was interesting, complex, and it captures the reader's attention.
1616960922|5.0|B.S. continues to prove that he is one of the most imaginative authors of this generation. It's a well written and fun story.
B000071K5L|5.0|This book was perfect.  It was exactly what my daughter needed for school, since it was a requirement.  She really enjoyed the book.
B009JNXK88|5.0|I feel like a stud muffin when I play this game. I soooooo regimens getting this game! ITS AMAZING PEOPLE!
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Have to be honest, the reason I went for the album was for one song. I most definitely and pleasantly was surprised by the rest of the album. Set it and forget it.
0425263916|5.0|Enjoyed continuation of story from 1st book Bared To You.  Liked the part about them getting to know each other better - sex scenes were hot. The idea that Gideon did as he said he would do to protect Eva from Nathan was very interesting.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Dune has been voted the best science fiction novel of all time; I can't disagree with that. It is a sweeping epic of ecology, intrigue and the power of faith, every bit as meaningful today as it was when it was first published more than 40 years ago.
B008WCP2KG|3.0|Must be my age but Nah not for me, on saying that my daughter raves over it, that is why she is getting it for Christmas.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I was so excited to see this movie. I loved the book. The way the vampire story was woven into Lincoln's true story and our nations history was masterful. What was happening at that time was intense and the movie traded all of the authentic drama of the times for the same old vampire slaying we've been seeing for years. Hard to believe the same person wrote the book and the screen play.<br /><br />Maybe if I hadn't read and loved the book it would have been a fun, silly vampire flick... or not.
B009S2U77C|4.0|The husband and wife duo of Ian MacKaye (Fugazi, Minor Threat) and Amy Farina (The Warmers) have had a pretty good reason for their long break between their last album and 'The Odds': They've been being parents to their four-year-old son and generally just living the family life. Hopefully that kid's ready to get his own place soon, because these two have got a great thing going here, and I sure wouldn't want to see it put on hiatus again.<br /><br />While The Evens' sound could still be considered post-hardcore like their previous bands, it's more stripped-down, and the intensity-level is a good two notches lower. Lets call it post post-hardcore. But that doesn't mean it's mellow. MacKaye is still his old angry self here, railing against idiots and injustice over his jagged riffs and Amy's weird, stuttering beats, resulting in a dark, almost ominous sound that shares as much in common with the post-rock of bands like Slint and Rodan as Fugazi. Farina takes vocal turns as well, and her lyrics here tend to be more abstract compared with her partner's upfront and brutal honesty.<br /><br />The arrangements on 'The Odds' can be very complex, as evidenced by the math-rock-style odd time-signatures and angular riffs of songs like \\"Wanted Criminals,\\" \\"Warble Factor,\\" and \\"Let's Get Well.\\" The excellent, Sonic Youth-esque \\"Wonder Why\\" is extremely hypnotic, especially with headphones, but the most instantly accessible song on the album to me is undoubtedly \\"King of Kings,\\" an infectious anthem that I could picture everyone singing along to at their shows, fists pumping in the air. There's a tangible energy to these songs, even if MacKaye is laying off the distortion pedal some these days.<br /><br />While 'The Odds' may not be the return to the Fugazi sound that some fans, I'm sure, are still craving, this is in no way a bad thing. This album finds The Evens really hitting their stride as a songwriting duo, with a chemistry that's undeniable, and songs that are creative and adventurous while still maintaining accessible--dare I say catchy?--jammy grooves for the listener to latch onto, resulting in a listening experience that makes for excellent head-bobbing music AND excellent late-night headphone music to lose oneself in for a little while.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I enjoyed this book and will look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.  I found the Pillars of the Earth and World Without End to be a bit more entertaining, but am fascinated to learn about the history of events leading up to and during WWI.
B001UU75WK|4.0|I really enjoyed this series. Though it may have a flavor of the X-Files, this show is more exciting and also 'of this world' type of action. Makes it a more realistic sci fi, if there is such a thing!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I always enjoy John Grishams books but I didn't like this one as much.  I can't pinpoint why.  It just didn't hold my interest  as much.  But I'm glad I read it.  When I buy his books, I don't have to read the review because I just know I will enjoy it.
0684135051|4.0|Elizabeth Zimmermann's writing style is very informal and friendly, her instructions are usually clear and she gives patterns that can easily be adapted to the gauge of the yarn that anyone might have on hand. This would not be the first knitting book I would give a new knitter, but it would be among the first books I would recommend to any knitter struggling to understand how to knit more comfortably.<br /><br />Minus one star, only because she suggests that left handed knitters should knit right handed so they can follow patterns, which is a very outdated piece of advice. (If you knit left handed, you know that all you need to do is understand that increases and decreases are either left or right slanted, once you do that you're golden.)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was one of the hottest and most romantic books I have read in a long time , its good no great !
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Honestly i just love this show to death, but this season brought back the beginnings by hunting ghosts and whatnot, not just worrying over &#34;lucifer&#34; and the apocalypse which was nice :D Other than Sam's increasingly terrible hair, the show was as excellent as the previous ones and I fully recommend it, and all previous seasons of course, to everyone
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell does it again!  As soon as a new book about Scarpetta comes out I buy it. Couldn't put the Kindle down.
B005K8H8W0|1.0|In no way am I rating the music on this album 1 star, I love The Smashing Pumpkins, especially this album which is why I was so disappointed to open a brand new LP to find sticky goo all over both records.  I cleaned it off as good as I could with some gruve glide but that's not really what that stuff was made for. It plays but it makes horrible noises when the it plays the parts of the record that had the goo on it, now I have an open LP that is un-listenable hence the one star rating.  I'm left with a strong sense of WTF, how about some quality control Virgin??
B008QE9VJI|4.0|Director Tim Burton has a quirky vision - dark but with comedy. This remake of the 1970's TV soap opera into a feature film is funny and tender (except when Barnabas is killing someone.) It does not take itself seriously. It's entertaining and enjoyable. Young children would probably be frightened. Johnny Depp & Michelle Pfeiffer are wonderful. Good addition to home video library for cold & dark winter nights.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|good game if ur into point and click adventures..hint option was helpful with all of the scene changes that were necessary.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another great Grisham Book, easy to read and keeps your attention. I haven't missed many of his books.  This ranked high on the list.
B007V5XT1O|5.0|I love Carrie Underwoods music so this was a must buy. The price was very good considering how many song came with. I only had one problem with buying it and that was the song blowin away didn't download at first. I had to try a second try.
B00899F0G8|5.0|One of the better shows on TV...every episode keeps you guessing and you are always left wanting to watch more.. I can't wait for the next season!
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|A DVD for everyone viewing and listening enjoyment. I like the vast variety of entertainers that song along with Tony Bennett. I would recommend this DVD to all ages.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Me and my kids play it and love it. I suggest this game because its fun for all ages, thanks.
B0072NWKEC|4.0|As someone who has read lot of world war 2 non-fiction books one thing I think many lack is bringing to life the day to day life of civilians, especially in Germany.  This book does a good job if that as well as adding in the  interesting evil doers of the Nazis.  And, a good detective story as well. Somewhat predictable in that aspect, thus the 4 stars.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Jim Carrey brings his delightful interpetation to the role of the Grinch in this fun adaptation of the Dr. Seuss classic. This feast for all the senses, (including your funny bone) is sure to tickle the kids and the kid in you for years to come. We enjoy watching this with our grand kids every year.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|[[ASIN:0385344333 A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel]]<br /><br />I'm never disappointed by the detail in Lee Child's series.  Great mystery, action and all tied together with Jack Reacher's past experiences.  Can't go wrong for an escape read.
B003YOASY2|5.0|great album<br />loved it when it came out and still do and i still remember all the songs<br />sad no way
B00913P6G0|5.0|This might be the best album of 2012. From front to back this joint goes hard. Great narrative told throughout the album.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is a great show. Watching these episodes were easy through the streaming service whether it be on my tablet, laptop or gaming console.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This is my fave Van Halen. A bit darker. Eddie is awesome. The rhythm section is tight. David Lee is right on his game.
1844256383|5.0|Mr. S howard has produced a clear and thorough book of saxophone ownership, with care and cleanliness there as well as the delights of owning and playing. He has had online reviews and articles for years, of quality and clarity. One can never learn enough or too much in most areas of interest and the challenges of saxophone playing deserve a quality book with clear illustration. Get it.
B000VCDJQY|5.0|My fave Epica album of them all and I love this band. Excellent mix of gothic, classical, and metal. I would buy it ten times.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|One of the best games I've ever played on a Smartphone, Simple controls, but complex enough to keep me interested and challenged.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I bought this book based on the description and all the reviews saying it was so good.  Don't be mislead.  I often get Kindle books for a third the cost and some are quite good.  This one was a huge disappointment and I paid wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much.  Story line was bizarre from the beginning but I tried to hang in there.  For half the book, Amy's sections weren't worth reading.  I almost stopped before I got half way.  Then it picked up and got interesting, then a complete tire flat at the end.  Easy to conclude the author may be as disturbed as the character Amy in the book.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|So far, one of the best superhero movies made! Aside from the AVENGERS, which Iron Man is a big part of. We look forward to IM3 !
0345803485|1.0|I wondered what all the hype was about this book so I checked it out of the library with no idea what it was about.  If you leave the sex out of this book, you'd have a pamphlet.  I think my title is an accurate description.  If the thought of BDSM turns you off, don't bother.  If you're curious, it's an ok story - especially if lots of sex does it for you. I'm glad I didn't buy it.
B001IAME78|4.0|I love MARVEL movies ! This is part of the collection that we are currently collecting! Long live the AVENGERS!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The book was very entertaining. I really enjoyed it. I cannot wait to read all of the books in this series.
0062235893|5.0|When I received this book, I almost want to return it immediately. It's only 3 pages with about 10 lines of words! (The information says 8 pages because it's counting each side of each page, including covers.) And the drawing was kind of old fasioned and not even very cute.<br /><br />But it completely changed my mind after reading it to my 3 month old son once. He was very interested in this book, looked at it intensely, and by the time I finish those short verses, he is already sleepy! It's almost magical!<br /><br />Now this book has become part of his sleeping routine and I read it to him every night. I add good night mom / dad / Snoopy / everybody... at the end and it really sets him into the sleeping mode. Now I think this book is the perfect length because you can't read a full complex story to a baby trying to get him to sleep. Also love the cover material, it's very soft. Now my son is 4 month old and he starts to grab the book when I read it to him!

B005651R24|5.0|Will Grayson, Will Grayson is the best book I have read this year and in my top ten books I've read in my life. Strangely relatable, this book has a quirky mixture of great amusement and heart rending sadness. In addition it has amazing quotes that hit right where it counts. Loved it to pieces and read it in half a day. Could not put it down.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|not quite what I thought it would be. Thought it would be more like angry birds. So its okay but a little disapointing

B004GJDQT8|4.0|I love to use this App when out shopping, especially if I'm at a store with high-markup.  I scan the barcode, read the reviews, compare the price, and decide wether to buy locally, on Amazon, or stick it on my Amazon wish list for future consideration.  I just wish that there was a quicker sequence for scanning something straight into my wish list.

1423140605|4.0|Another hit from Rick Riordan. Loved his 3rd installment to the series and hope he writes many more. This is the perfect Christmas gift for his fans.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|Either Cornwell's first 15 books were not written by her, or the series since Book of the Dead has been written by a ghostwriter, because there is NO WAY an author changes styles this dramatically.  This is just plain, lazy writing. Either her editors are afraid to edit her now, or they don't care either, because these last 5 books have been complete trash.  Every other word is \\"and\\" (over 500 in the last book alone).  Cornwell expects the reader to believe that EVERYONE always has a problem with Scarpetta, and wants to do her or her family/friends harm.  I do not know why I continue to torture myself by reading her books; perhaps hoping one day the \\"real\\" Patricia Cornwell will emerge and write a book like she used too.  This will be the last book of hers I purchase (in fact, I have already requested a refund from Amazon because it was so horrible).  From now on, if I want to read one of her books, I will borrow it from the library.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|fun game. bad update. don't get the update, it messes up everything on the app. overall good game with fun gameplay
B009FZHYKU|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW!!!  It keeps you guessing and always on your toes!!!  I look forward to each week and am never disappointed!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It's tough to find the humorous side of cancer, but this book manages to do just that. This is the story of two teenagers,(both with cancer) who fall in love and want nothing more than to just be well again. It's about their parents, who struggle with the harsh realities of having a child with cancer, and it's about a somewhat crazy, hard drinking, author from the Netherlands who somehow ties it all together. Considering the subject, you would think that the story would be overly depressing, but this book is surprisingly witty and funny. Don't get me wrong, it definitely has it's heartbreaking moments, (how could it not?) but it's also about love and hope, and it's a great read. I loved it from start to finish and I highly recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|In true John Grisham style the twists and turns<br />in this book leads you in many directions and the<br />ending is very gratifying.  Thumbs Up.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I like it. its pretty good. its a demo solo not to much game time but... its good. its really fun to put gunpowder barrels and catch them on fire!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|A major page Turner. I couldn't put it down. Changing from the past and the future made the experience more intense.

B008IZYWXU|5.0|This is an incredible must have for the Freddie Mercury fan.  If you want to explore all the incredible talents this man possessed-this collector edition is one to have.  Includes 3 cd's and 1 DVD along with booklet.  It is the UK version and they GET it when it comes to Queen....obviously.
B0053O89XI|5.0|This is one of my favorite seasons! Love seeing Leonard and Penny get back together. Mayim's character adds so much hilarity to the show as well!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have always been a Kay Scarpetta series fan and have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books. The last few have taken me a little longer to read and get into. There seems to be a lot of jumping around and fragmented thinking by the characters. That being said, if you have enjoyed others in this series, this book is worth your time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's just getting better and better. I HAVE to read the next one. I just don't even know what to predict next. I love this book just like the first. I totally recommend it to anyone of any age. Its a must read!
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I can't speak highly enough about this book. I read it faster than probably any book in recent memory. This is specifically not written for Who fans, I don't think. Instead of going behind the scenes of writing My Generation, Won't Get Fooled Again, and his countless other hits, he really, truly bares his soul, warts and all. It is in no way self-pitying, however. I compare it to the few other rock memoirs I've read -- I really don't enjoy how indulgent they tend to be, by their nature -- and it's far better than the efforts of Ray Davies (&#34;X-Ray&#34; being a fictionalized memoir), Dave Davies, Keith Richards, and Eric Clapton. Clapton came off as a gullible doofus with little sense of how adolescent he still sounds. Richards wrote what his publishers told him would make the most money. &#34;Who I Am&#34; stands in stark contrast to all these as sounding like Pete, being profoundly introspective, extremely generous to others, harsh on himself, and ultimately far more accessible than I expected.<br /><br />The editing has been criticized as disjointed and sketchy. I believe the editing is actually a virtue. What remains from what he said was more than 900 manuscript pages is a series of taught vignettes that detail exactly what happened, what he thought or thought happened, and a remarkable absence of drawn out monologues, rants, or &#34;stuff Pete thinks&#34; you should care about.<br /><br />Similarly, early reviews said he offered little in the way of insights or praise of other musicians. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, Bruce Springsteen, Ray Davies, Bob Dylan, Charles Mingus, and a host of others come in for regular and effusive praise.<br /><br />Ultimately, this book about someone else, with whom I have seemingly 0% in common, has left me thinking for days about my own life -- reflecting happily, sadly, and simply questioning my own past, present, and future. It's made me think deeply. Isn't that all you can ask of any good book?
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is definitely the kind of movie that you want to watch with someone so that you can talk about it afterwards.  The main characters are delightful, and Bruce Willis and Edward Norton are excellent in their roles.

B00A77II0U|4.0|I would liked to have given it a 4-1/2.  My only 5* rated games have been reserved for Snark Busters!  I saw a few hints in this game, please say #3 will be coming to Kindle Fire android soon?!?
034580404X|5.0|I found this trilogy to be very entertaining. The second book was my favorite. I read the books a second time to find out what I missed the first time. The &#34;shock value&#34; prohibited my absorbtion of important information. I found the relations and the language a bit over the top, but a great read. Definately for a mature audiance!  I hope you enjoy, I look forward to other works by E L James.
1452110581|5.0|It's great, I love every one of the poems.  I bought extra copies for Christmas gifts for my cat loving friends.<br />The book has been on the non fiction best seller list locally since it came out
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Amazing again!<br />What a wonderful addition to the stories Phillippa Gregory has given us over the years. Not many books are written about Anne Neville and the family. I love Philippas books. They make history &#34;breathe&#34;.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|Cinematography, music, acting are all superb.<br />The movie is a timeless classic and the 100th anniversary Blu-Ray makes it even better.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Loved this Movie. Fan of Alien Movies. Exciting from start to finish with a nice twist. 4 stars bar none.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|Is the cup half empty or half full? I think it's unfortunate when people who haven't actually seen a DVD leave negative reviews that reflect badly on an artist. You don't see an album like, say, \\"The Who Live At Leeds\\" getting 1 & 2 star reviews because the producer didn't happen to include over half the concert on the originally released album.<br /><br />Now on to the issue at hand, this DVD of songs from The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary shows. I have seen it, and I love it! I first went to a Beach Boys concert in 1971 (December 4th in San Diego). I've been to dozens of Beach Boys concerts since, as well as a number of Brian and Al's solo shows, and the Beach Boys 50th show I attended in Irvine, CA was one of the very, very best (I would have been happy with mediocre, just to see the guys all together again, but as this DVD attests, I didn't have to settle).<br /><br />The Beach Boys like the Beatles always have to strike a balance between satisfying the more casual fan and the devotee in their releases. You would see this on this tour in the set lists, in which the hits were juggled with back catalog classics like \\"Marcella,\\" \\"All This Is That,\\" and \\"This Whole World.\\" The Beach Boys themselves couldn't see eye to eye on what to include or exclude, and of course Beach Boys fans can't either.<br /><br />THE POSITIVES: The video and audio quality is, to my eyes and ears, excellent. The boys sound great. To me, the vocals of Al Jardine are the strongest of the Beach Boys these days. Now, I like many Beach Boys fans, can quibble about which songs should have been included or not. Yes, I'd like one or two of the ballad hits, \\"In My Room,\\" \\"Warmth Of The Sun,\\"etc., and would love to have \\"409\\" replaced with, say, \\"Surfin' USA.\\" But, every one of the 21 songs on this DVD sounds great. And for me it's worth the price of admission just to have the \\"Do It Again\\" intro with Jeff Foskett introducing the boys as they come on-stage and then rip into the song; and the beautiful\\"All This Is That,\\" one of the lesser known tracks that WAS included (along with \\"Marcella\\"). I'm also glad they included \\"Isn't It Time\\" and the title track from \\"That's Why God Made The Radio.\\" A price of $10-$12 for an excellent quality DVD with 21 excellent songs is a great deal, as is $15 for the blu-ray.<br /><br />THE NEGATIVES: Sure, I'd love all 50 songs from the full 2 1/2 hour show. And while I'm at it I'd love for them to include a bonus of a set by sometimes opener California Saga (nine of the Beach Boys adult kids singing amazing versions of the Beach Boys back catalog). I'll buy a full concert version if that is released.<br /><br />To sum up, this DVD is an excellent momento of one of the best shows I have ever seen.
0811879542|5.0|This was such a hit in our house.  I had bought it for my 2 yr old, but found my 5 yr old reading it over and over again!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Game is a lot of fun for all ages, even my 3understanding year old enjoys it. Makes you use your brain
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I got a kick out of playing around with this app.  There's a whole lot of good technology at work.  With some practice I suspect I could actually learn how to play the piano, at least somewhat for amusment.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The best Masterpiece series EVER.  Absolutely stunning in production values, acting, writing, production, casting, costumes, story, set designs; in a word EVERYTHING.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This series is a must read for fans of the original Percy Jackson series. It is every bit as good, and in some ways, even better. Highly recommended.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|I've always been a Soundgarden fan. I'm even more of a Chris Cornell fan. I think he has one of the most powerful voices and styles in all modern music. Whether he's doing quiet and slow or loud and fast he sounds great and really gives a song an emotional feeling and \\"oomph\\". That being said when he left Soundgarden he just wasn't the same. The first Audio Slave album was fantastic. . .but for me it was a one album band and then as then he drifted into solo stuff which I wasn't a fan of. Now that he's back with the band he, and the band, are firing on all cylinders and making great music. Something about being back with the band has brought him back to his original form. It has that unique Soundgarden sound. Each of their albums is different but they all have a similar style that ties it together. To give you an idea of which sound is my favorite, its Superunknown. I love the slow and dark stuff. This album doesn't have much of that on it but its still great.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Several in our family are loving this series!  It's well written and makes me even happier I have a Kindle so I could just download the second book in the middle of the night right after the first one ended.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The missions that were discussed in this book inspires me to become better at tasks in life physically and mentally. It gave me a boost in my sense of pride toward my country and what we really have to sacrifice to keep our way of life. Thank you to everyone who serves and gives their sacrifice everyday so we can live in peace and enjoy our families.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love the plot twists, the surprises, the ever changing alliances, the emotional conflict.  It is very addicting.  I am caught up now and have to wait an entire week for the newest episode.  very frustrating.
0385344228|1.0|I expected this book to be a page tuner.  I was bored and the story continually repeated itself. The end was anti-climatic.  This was a waste of my time (and I love reading thrillers).
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Hands down one of the best shows on TV. Scary, eye-opening, and just all around shocking. Love that this season is entirely new but still has some of the same cast. Amazing!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I blew through 50 Shades and then the Bared to you books, I got hooked on romance so I started reading everything.  And everything else were very very short books that I could finish in an hour.  I could read a whole series in a day.  This book changed that, it was actually a whole story in one book, it brought me back to how much I enjoyed 50 and Bared to You<br /><br />I enjoyed this story, the characters were so much fun.  I loved everything that happened to them, everything they went through.  I also loved how Travis had to work for it.  And their problems weren't extremely crazy, it sounded a little more real.  They made me laugh and yearn for them to work out in the end.<br /><br />I have recommended this to my friends and they loved it just as much.  Can't wait for Walking Disaster!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The writing is witty and innovative, the acting is top notch and the characters are off beat, and interesting .
B004V5A7K8|4.0|This is one of my favorites, it is very addictive. Works well, each level gets harder, so it doesn't get boring at all
0345536886|5.0|Great book, I purchased it to replace the one that I loaned my attorney to read and didn't get it back.  He said it was great
B007THA4FI|2.0|I restarted this book several times and still coudn't get into it.  I only bought it because of the author.
B002361MLA|5.0|THE POWER OF NOW IS TRUELY CAPABLE OF MOTIVATING A LIFE TRANSFORMATION IF THE READER REALLY DESIRES ONE AND IS WILLING TO PUT IN THE EFFORT, MOMENT BY MOMENT.  I AM ON SUCH A PATH! GOD BLESS MR. TOLLE!

B009G78EE2|4.0|These two are redefining and challenging hip hop in interesting and lovable ways. Get ready for deep sampling, thoughtful verse, and enticing beats.
B00138KEH2|5.0|This is hands down my favorite album of all time. As some of the other reviewers said, it combines the best of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine.<br /><br />I really wish they would get back together. I saw them in concert in 2005 and it's still to this day one of my favorite shows.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I don't usually laugh out loud when reading books, but this one was a side-splitter. Tina Fey is a wonderful comedian but an even better writer.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the hunger games series. This book had a lot of twists and turns. I would recommend this book to others to read. Can't wait to see the movie
B005IQZB14|4.0|I can't put the book down. What a great story of strength and perseverance. You will not be disappointed in purchasing and reading this book.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was  once an employee of  Dr. Alexander, this is a great book.  Excellent reading. Please enjoy this book. It is Great!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|For anyone who enjoyed the 50 Shades series...In some ways even better. Loved the characters and the sexy scenes were out of this world.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|Be for warned about this particular package reguarding this movie. It states that you will be able to download a Ultra-Violet copy to you account in the cloud. THIS IS FALSE and a LIE! You will only be able to use you code for the iTune download even though it says that you can choose to do either. VUDU.com doesn't have this movie available yet for Ultra-Violet.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|We loved the original Nanny McPhee.  Often sequels are rather a disappointment, but not this one.  Our whole family could enjoy the different layers of humor, and it can be hard to find something that satisfies ages 3 to adults.  The lessons are ones that parents can appreciate and children can understand.  Emma Thompson has outdone herself again.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|it's not at all responsive,  some controls work ok and others won't do anything.  Not good when ur trying to land.  After screwin with it for an hour &amp; 1/2 I've lost interest  in wasting anymore time with it,  uninstall
B000FC1MCS|3.0|This book is written from the perspective of a 15 year old boy with autism.  As a book written by a child it's a good read.  As a literary work of art, it's fair.  It's well written in that you feel like you're truly listening to a high functioning autistic teen, but the story really goes nowhere.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I like this product because you can set your own music as an alarm option. The installed alarm tones are cool as well.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I loved The Kite Runner, so when my book group recommended this one I was excited.  The book is a very well written.  You find yourself in the middle of Afghanistan prior to the Taliban uprising through today...the beauty of what was and into the horror of what is.  The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because it was too painful to read in one sitting.  I had to keep stopping and walk away for awhile.  Excellent book? Yes.  Masterpiece?  Yes.  Something everyone should read?  Yes - if you have the stomach for it.  It is a brutal read.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I wore out the free versions of these, \\"mixtapes.\\" And I can say without a doubt, the mastering on these songs alone is worth the money.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My 6th grader read this for school.  They had to keep a journal that included pointed questions, so she asked me to read it along with her.  We read a chapter per day and I actually found myself wanting to read ahead.  It's full of unique adventures and characters.  Enough to take your imagination along for the ride without feeling like it's just too far fetched (even though it is).  My daughter really enjoyed it as did most of the other kids in her class.  I would definitely recommend it for tweens and also as a good book to read along with your child - book group style.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I was seriously jealous when I saw that Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger were available on iOS. They slowly made their way to Android and now Final Fantasy 3 has made it's way to the Amazon store. I'm playing this on my Kindle Fire HD and it's wonderful. I briefly played this game on the Nintendo DS and it's a great port of that version of the game. I've put about 9 hours into the game so far and I'm loving every bit of it.<br /><br />I can't wait to play other Final Fantasy games on my Kindle Fire. I'd also love to see Chrono Trigger make it's way over.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is something that can eventually be fixed. I think that support for Amazon GameCircle would be great. That way when I eventually upgrade to the next line of Kindle Fire products I can sync my save data and continue where I leave off.
B000XVSU9O|5.0|I recently had my Tarot cards read for fun. The reader told me about this book and said it would change my life. She was right.  If you ever really wondered what happens when we leave our bodies this book will take you on the journey and be so descriptive about the other side that you will be in awe.  I have heard about near death experiences before but this one is so captivating - all your questions will be answered.  Its an old book that will stand the test of time. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Video is nice and clear.  Audio well balanced.  SMASH has a great deal of music so this is very important.  I very much enjoyed the series and the music that goes with it.  Very true to the life of Marilyn Monroe, as well.
B000BDLJBU|5.0|My hat is off to Neutrik for the quality. These are the best connector i've ever used and will not buy another plastic plug ever again. I like them so much that i've changed all my phone plugs to these iron beast. This is it folks, don't look elsewhere.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|A gripping  story line well written, a good buid up for the next couple of Harry Hole books, different and a good read
B009GX7IRA|5.0|this is the best show ever, I love it watch all the marathons, and love that i get it right after it airs on roku.
0345803485|5.0|I completely loved the series. The first book, however, was my favorite! I would recommend it for any and all women.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|i love the show, did not think i would after season one, but hooked now and never miss an episode
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Really cute and deep film.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Thought provoking. Reminds me of my childhood at certain points in the movie
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The Racketeer may not be Grisham's best book, but definitely a good read. If you like Grisham this book will be a good fit for you.
B009LHWEKW|4.0|No one ever said this show was Emmy award winning material.  However, it's a fun and enjoyable ride through some Supernatural crazy!  What sets this show apart from most of the fodder on TV is the fact that they actually TRY to incorporate simple plot devices, and they make a sincere effort at character development.  A viewer may actually feel invested when a character dies or suffers misfortune.  For an hour foray to let your mind wander and be entertained a bit, Supernatural Season 8 is not the worst choice out there!
0525953728|5.0|I wasn't sure if i would like this book but wanted it just bc it is a piece of history.  I bought it and started reading it and couldn't put it down... What a great book! Very interesting!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham books. This one was the very best by far. I so enjoy his writings
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read every book Nelson DeMille has written and loved most all of them. I was waiting for The Panther with great anticipation. There were some great John Cory lines throughout the book, however, the book dragged. 90% of the book was leading up to the meeting with John Corey and The Panther and before you could say Kate Mayfield it was over. I still have faith that his next John Corey book will be excellent like the others, he just whiffed this one,
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love this game. It is always changing and is updated regularly. Rooms are fun and different. thank you for a fun game
B005LAJ1PE|4.0|The show itself is worth all 5 stars. The only reason I didn't rate the product that way is because the case when I received it, was all busted up on the inside. The discs were loose and just rolling around in it. So far, I haven't noticed them to be damaged, but it is inconvenient, because I don't want them to become scratched.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I really like this plus u can change the color of the note like sticky notes I really recommend this

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Sometimes, when you're stuck, just put it down and return later - you'll be surprised how easily the solution will come to you.
B009P5S11G|4.0|This new release by Rihanna is like Neapolitan ice cream. She has three flavors for her fans to taste.  Party, Rnb, and Alternative is for you to try. I must be a fat kid because I enjoyed all three.  On some tracks I didn't know if I was listening to a Rihanna or Pink record. If you like a variety of sounds this project is for you. Rihanna dipping into different genres is going to widen her fan base. If I was Tyler Swift or Pink I would hide my fans. Unapologetic host some hot! guest features. \\"Right Now\\" ft. David and \\"Stay\\" ft. Mikky are the best collaborations on the album. Rihanna is growing and getting better with each album.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks<br />Diamonds<br />Love song<br />Numb<br />Stay<br />What now<br />Nobodys Business<br />Right Now

B006YC74E8|5.0|There are plenty of ways to perform basic photo editing on the Kindle Fire. Just search through the App Store here, find one that fits your needs and you're ready to go. But do read the reviews, as some are better than others.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006YC74E8 Photo Editor]] by Macgyver is one of those that is definitely a better app. It's tight, easy to use, and will download to the Kindle Fire in under 20 seconds. Once you have downloaded this app, take a few minutes to explore its easy to follow interface. As noted in the description, you can make adjustments to the color, rotate and crop your images, resize and frame them, and add a variety of effects. Gamma correction is easy, as is the auto contrast function. You can blur or sharpen your photos, add oil paint effects, do black & white high contrast, sepia toning, then save your edited images as JPG or PNG files.<br /><br />From a personal perspective, I prefer to do image manipulating, color correction and other digital image editing on one of the computers by using one of the Adobe Photoshop tools, Nikon Capture NX 2, Nikon ViewNX 2 (a freebie) or PhotoFiltre (another freebie). On the Mac, iPhoto does a good job with basic digital manipulation. But if you need to do some basic photo editing on the Kindle Fire, this app is surprisingly good, and offers more features than one might expect.<br /><br />This [[ASIN:B006YC74E8 Photo Editor]] app offers excellent results with on-the-fly image edits using the Kindle Fire, and apparently is well behaved with the Kindle Fire HD as well. It has features found in some of the better commercial software packages for the PC and the Mac, and as a freebie, it's very hard to beat.<br /><br />11/20/2012
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app was exactly what I was looking for - simple and straightforward.  I wanted a no fluff app for quick weather updates and this is it.  Very happy.
0547884591|5.0|The 4 Hour Workweek changed my life and helped me changed the life of thousands of people too in France.<br /><br />This book have the power to do the same. The part about meta-learning is simply amazing, and of course, the cooking part is awesome and can transform any really bad cook like me in a guy who can entertain friends and women with delicious and simple to made dishes.<br /><br />If you are skeptic, be skeptic the smart way : by testing it instead of doing nothing. Go for it !
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Loved it,great Halloween movie.<br />Not one for soap box opera TV.So this re-make<br />of Dark Shadow was refreshing and enjoyable.<br />Of course I'm a Johnny Depp,fan.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|An excellent story set in history giving it a strong sense of realism. The characters are each painted so well as they cope with loss, grief, the second world war in the London blitz and prewar life in Australia The story weaves around an eldest daughter trying to make sense of her some secrets surrounding her mother who is near death after a long and apparently happy life. The discoveries of he mother's life unfold in small bites and kept me engaged right to the end. I went back and reread the last few chapters to re-engage with the experience. It was a book I did not want to finish. A most enjoyable read with a story and characters who are still going around in my mind days later.
034580404X|5.0|I usually don't read romance novels, but everyone else at work was reading this, so I decided to see what the big deal was about. After the first few chapters I was hooked. I read all three books in one week. The storyline was rock solid and the details were wonderful. You can see the characters in your head almost perfectly. I would recommend this to all adult readers
B009R9WAZ8|1.0|Ok, first off I like Rihanna, I really do but come on. Her music is getting worse and worse. It seems like she's trying way too hard to be hardcore. The first song... I mean wow. She dropped the F bomb at least 20 times. I don't have an issue with language in the proper place, but wow. What happened to good girl gone bad Rihanna? That was her best cd IMHO. This one has two, maybe three decent songs. Diamonds is ok, love with future is ok and the rest are well... Meh at best. Avoid this trash. I'm unapologetic about this review.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|With the high standard that was set by Follett's Fist Book of his Trilogy, Winter of the World does not disappoint with his excellent style integratiing history with his richly developed original characters and now including their offsprings. Do yourself and your friends a favor, especially during this time of giving, to share these wonderful books. You know you have a great book when you slow down in reading as you do not want it to end.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Last night I finished Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn. It seemed to be THE book of the summer, and contrary as always, I read it in the fall.<br /><br />A friend of mine told me it was a great read, filled with lots of twists. I did indeed find plot turns at unexpected places, and the book itself had that elusive Compelling Factor that made me want to keep reading.<br /><br />To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. For one thing, I couldn't emotionally connect with any of the characters except Boney, the police detective, and she was a background figure who appeared in only a few scenes. (I think I would have enjoyed the book much more if it had been told from her perspective, but perhaps it would have been a stretch.)<br /><br />Maybe I'm too much of a traditionalist : I expected more of a cozier read, and Flynn instead offers a harrowing tale of marriage turned inside out. That's not a bad thing at all, and it betrays my own shortcoming, not Flynn's.<br /><br />When Amy disappears, her husband, Nick, begins a search for her. The disappearance itself is strange, and it grows stranger as the book goes on. It is their wedding anniversary, and Amy always leaves him a scavenger hunt for his gift. In the book, the scavenger hunt is intertwined with the disappearance.<br /><br />Amy herself is a wonderful creation. She was nothing like what I expected - she's no victim having the vapours, that much is for certain. And that is a wonderful, rare thing. What she is - what the reader thinks she is - gets turned on its head as the story progresses.<br /><br />The ending is pure genius, but as I said, I never connected with any of the characters. I never read a chapter saying, \\"Oh no, oh no!\\" the way I would if I really loved the hero or the heroine. That's a biproduct of the twisty, turning plot, and I can understand that and the genius behind it, but the lack of connection was my visceral reaction.<br /><br />As I said, it was compelling. I never wanted to stop reading it, which is a mark of an assured, professional writer. Flynn's prose is deft enough to bring you into several different worlds, from Manhattan to Missouri.<br /><br />So: I appreciate the genius and the writing, since that is a very difficult thing to pull off, but I have enjoyed other mysteries and explorations of the strange planet known as Marriage far more.is a mark of an assured, professional writer.

B009T3AHDE|5.0|There will be spoilers. This was my take on the film and just a little bit of what I took away from it. First of all, I loved this movie.  Another reviewer on here said that no one can describe what its about because its about so many things. I completely agree. Essentially, the main character is Eric Packer a multi-billionaire whos desperate to get across town to his fathers old barber. Along the way he meets with people, either employees, business associates,security personel, and his new bride whom he married for circumstance and not love. Hes a young man of 28 and for his age hes acheived much. But you get the sense that hes lost, he doesnt understand his place in the world and he thinks that somehow if he re lives a part of his life and remembers his innocence he will somehow understand his purpose.Thus, trying to go to the barber. A place of happy memories for him. Now the real meat of the story of which makes this film so interesting ; comes from all the characters he meets on his journey to the barber. They all have thier own point of view on how the world works, how its ever changing and never receding to simpler times. As technology advances, humans become more dull and dependant on the things they want rather than need. to have those things you need money. The world is obsessed with money and it makes us less human because of it. We become greedy and careless of others, we lose touch with humanity and what we should be. Since Eric has so much money he is in all actually a perfect example of what the problems with society are. When he finally meets up with a former employee named Benno Levin, he for the first time hears and at least trys to understand what its like for those of us who struggle while the rich lose touch with humanity. By this point he seems so desperate to feel some kind of emotional response to the activities,turmoil of the day he would do anything to just FEEL. Thus shooting himself in the hand. The film ends with Benno pointing a gun atthe back of Erics head. We dont know if he shot Eric or not. I do know Eric didnt seem to worried about the fact that he could die. Throughout the whole movie you are trying to understand this man, why is he so paranoid that he gets a prostate exam daily? why cant he make a connection with his wife? why does it seem the only thing he does have feeling for is sex? Especially,whenthe animalistic nature of sex is for the reason to pro-create and yet,I find that ironic since he seems so morbidly curious about death; having heard about the death of a famous recording artist he favored and then later killing his body gaurd and feeling nothing.  Like I said theres so much going on in this film that every time you watch it you will come away having learned something new. Each character reveals to us a little nugget of truth about society and what we are becoming. Remember that was just my take on the film having watched it one time and reading the book twice. I do feel like this film is not really for entertainment purposes. I mean its entertaining to watch the actors performances. They are all just amazing and fabulously talented. But you really have to pay attention to dialogue in this film. You have to watch it will an open mind and open ears. Visually I really liked the cinematography. The limo was multifunctional. I was unsure how they could make each scene special when the characters are in one space for so long. But it works. i definitely reccomend it. Its not a blockbuster but if you want a taste of something different then what hollywood is churnning out, then Give Cosmopolis a try.

B0083H6AQA|4.0|I had been waiting for over a year to see this movie.Since im a fan Of Robert Pattinson. i feel like every new film he makes is like opening a christmas present. Each role he stretches and grows and you see him getting better and better. I thought the movie was really good. the beginning started off slow to me but they were establishing characters. id say about 30 minutes in I was hooked. all the actors performances were fantastic. i especially loved christina ricci. her character went through so many ranges of emotion dealing with him. I think Rob did an excellent job. he portrayed a smug, bastard quite well. in the end you hate him. i thought the locations/sets/costumes were all superb!!!
0811879542|5.0|Saw this at BN last year, and got it for my then-7 year old son. He loves it! It's too cute. I remember standing in the store looking through it and getting a huge kick out of it. (smiling and laughing to myself as I was doing it)<br /><br />A MUST for all kids. (I'm smiling now just thinking about it and writing this review!)
B001BKTEZA|4.0|Good black and white DVD viewing, and a salutary lesson in how not to treat your fellow man human beings!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|One of me and my family's fave C'mas movies. We constantly quote from it (all year-round!) and we watch it every year on C'mas Night. Chevy is great in it. Classic 80's C'mas movie.
B00000490M|5.0|is fun and approprate for the whole family. this movie you will be watching over again and again they just dont make them like this anymore.
B009MF56GC|5.0|The Expendables 2, is a great fun action packed movie. I really enjoyed watching it. I am a man that grew up watching the great 80's action movies and more importantly, grew up watching Sylvester Stallone movies. And to see Stallone in 2012 in a movie that looks and feels so 80ish is just amazing. Stallone is truly a multi talented guy. I was watching the behind the scenes video from the first and second movie and i was blown away by his commitment, dedication and passion for what he does. I totally recommend The Expendables II if you are looking for good old school action packed movies.<br />Yo Sly, you did it again and again and again :)<br />Keep up the good work..
630233683X|5.0|had alot of laughs it is a very interesting musical, fun for the whole family sound quaility though wasnt that great, but still worth it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great storyline with interesting characters. Shows how twisted the mind and relationships can be. A great read for anyone interested in psychology or sociology.
B00000GJ2B|1.0|this movie was the worst boxing movie ever made, sorry i wasted five dollars on it. but most all lost over an hour of my valuable time on this. dont make the same mistake i did. i warned you dont be stupid.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Most excellently written. Challenges any presumptions you may have when it comes to life, love, and what is real.<br />A must read for all looking to take a journey down the imperfect and dead end road of life.
6302824729|5.0|it is well worth the five dollars. not quite as good as karate kid 3 but is still a timeless classic. Ive watched it over 5 times and it never gets old.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I really loved it. Such a great book to practice your highlighting skills, as there are many memorable quotes. If you have ever stared at the stars in the desert, you'll love this book.
6303686796|5.0|was fun to see the man get his hand blown clean off, not a movie for young children but for us adults its a very fun timeless classic
B000ZHCQ5U|4.0|I never realized that this cold war classic was a Stanley Kubrick film, and I never knew Peter Sellers played multiple roles in it, but most importantly, I heard that George C. Scott was told by Kubrick to just mess around and be silly in order to prepare for the role and get into the spirit of it while planning all along on using that actual footage for the final takes. I also heard that though they both went on to have very successful careers, George C. Scott never forgave him for this trick, and refused to ever work with him again. Finally, I reckognized an african american in the flight crew under Slim Pickens command, but did not know at first that this was James Earl Jones. It was like watching Apocolypse Now more recently, and finding that Lawrence Fishbourne played a role in it.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I wondered about JK Rowling's ability to pen an adult book after so many years of writing for such a different audience (p.s. I've personally never read HP book so my expectations weren't swayed in any particular direction), but I was not disappointed. She's a brilliant writer and I was hooked into the story from the first page. A real insight into the intricacies of life in a small village, The Casual Vacancy is funny, sometimes sad, and overall an entertaining read. I started the book wondering how she would develop an interesting story based on such a small village and a relatively simple plot, but she did it well. The characters developed as the story evolved, and it wasn't long before I was picturing the people, their houses, their families, hating the horrible ones and loving the lovable ones. Don't overanalyse this book - just enjoy it for what it is - entertaining.<br />BTW, you'll enjoy it more if you're English or have lived in the UK.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It gives you the first hand experience of the seal team 6 in their efforts and success of tracking this criminal down.  I have read 2 books on the Seals and cannot be more proud of their service.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not one of his best, but it's always fun to live vicariously.  $8 million on a carribean island would be pretty nice.
B00005JLKB|4.0|It was okay for the price but some episodes skipped around and became unwatchable and the box was kinda beat up.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|this movie brought together Iron Man,Hulk,Captain America and Thor in a nice way.The plot was very good and put together in a way to keep you interested.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I downloaded this for my 4 year old nephew.  He loves playing Angry Birds, and I love watching him play!
B009329ZF2|4.0|i give battleship four stars because it was believable and funny.everyone should get a kick out of this movie,it has something for everyone.The amputee kicked butt.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I've spent 5 hours trying to get this game to load.<br />It sucks because it keeps on failing and it even erased my kindles memory.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I usually rank shows and movies highly if I like the characters. I find myself liking almost all of the characters in this cast, and consequently I thoroughly enjoy spending time with them. Have heard Season Three may be the last, which is very disappointing.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|This was an amazing deal on a great movie.<br />Includes two discs: One features the theatrical cut, second features a directors version.<br />Also features the original animated shorts of the movie's 4 realms and \\"behind the soundtrack\\"
0451232852|3.0|Fall of Giants had the potential to be a good read.  Then I got to the poorly written porn and was so sorry I wasted that time.  Then the story line became so predictable that I once again regreted wasting my time. I could put up with the predicable story if Mr. Follett just said, they had and affair, she got pregnant, then the lawyer waited in the library.
034580404X|5.0|I absolutely love this series! After having had no time to read in a long time! This series will definetly get you back to reading again!
0399157565|5.0|Great Book well worth the money! a must have for the scarpetta lovers!This book was all the hype and kept the reader on the edge of the seat the whole time. The reader will not be unhappy with this story! the plot the setting is all great.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A great scam to get out of prison and make money... lots of questions but no surprises.  All fiction of course but good reading.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|If you are a Hitchcock and Cary Grant fan, this is the dvd for you. Loved the movie and the biography on Mr. Grant.
B007SSDS24|4.0|This is a great movie. This is for anyone who likes sci-fi action and adventure.  I did like watching it.
B00321MGPG|5.0|If you have never watched these, they should be at the top of your shopping list, they are one of the coolest DVDs I have ever watched.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was way more deeply romantic then I thought it would be.  Loved it. Would recommend it to anyone who enjoy saucy romance.
B009K0P10K|3.0|A little darker than the first season...Emily's cover seems to be wearing thin. Not so much innocence all around. Still a fan, but Season 1 was better.
1591396190|4.0|W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne presented their ideas in their best-seller book Blue Ocean Strategy in 2005 and gave very insightful strategy approaches to current competitive business world: How to create a \\"Blue Ocean\\" and make the competition irrelevant, which means a company should create new demand in an uncontested market rather than compete head-to-head with other competitors in the existing industry.<br /><br />The Concept of Blue Ocean<br />  Red Ocean and Blue Ocean are two opposite concepts. \\"In the Red Ocean, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are known\\". Market share is the first factor that companies considered. They try to outperform their rivals through taking up a greater share of product or service demand. As the market space gets crowded, profits and growth were reduced. The fierce competition turns the ocean bloody-- red oceans. However, Blue Ocean represents the industries or segments that are not recognized by the existing market players- the unknown market space. \\"In the Blue Ocean, demand is created rather than fought over\\". Opportunities in Blue Ocean are ample and competition there is irrelevant. It is a potential market space that is not yet explored by others. Kim and Mauborgne believed that \\"while red ocean strategies-- traditional competition-based strategies were necessary, they were not sufficient to sustain high performance. Companies need to go beyond competing. To seize new profit and growth opportunities they also need to create blue oceans\\".<br /><br />  However, it is not easy for companies who have become accustomed to their practices to contest for market share, to make decisions to change their current strategy and look for a Blue Ocean. Because they think it would \\"only serve to increase costs, cause conflict amongst staff and diverge from the corporation's vision\\".<br /><br />Methods to Create Blue Ocean and Make the Competition Irrelevant<br />  The book talked about difficulties that need to be overcome when executing the \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" and provided the appropriate strategies that would have to be implemented for the successful creation of uncontested market and demands for new products or services. The following six principles given by the authors are necessary for Blue Ocean strategy formulation and execution.1. Reconstructing market boundaries 2. Focusing on the big picture rather than the numbers 3. Reaching beyond existing demand 4. Getting the strategic sequence right 5. Overcome key organizational hurdles 6. Building execution into strategy<br /><br />  Although the book gave the six paths to implement a Blue Ocean strategy, it didn't give an answer to how a company reinvents a business and make the company grow and make profits in a market with a lot of uncertainties.  However, Blue Ocean has emerged as one of the most important business strategy in the new globally competitive markets. It has already benefited numerous companies and has received stellar reviews.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|we played at a movie nite fro friends and both couples enjoyed the adult fairy tale......may be too dramatic for young ones though.....
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Hard to read.  I like to enjoy reading...not analyze each sentence to decipher what is being said.  I know that when you read<br />anything written in a particular historical setting, that can be expected...but this was just not enjoyable for me.
B00338QENI|4.0|I read this book for my book club. It is not a book I would have chosen on my own. It was a little difficult to read because there were a lot of names and some very intricate medical chapters on human cells. It was interesting in that it related to one woman who was the subject of a very specific cell line known as HeLa. Even though I found it laborious reading in parts, it was very educational. I learned something that many people do not even think about or choose to read about. The book alternated chapters about the laboratory tests and how the cells were used to the life of the woman and decendants of her cell line. Also discussed  was the moral issue as to whether or not these cells, or others, should have been a monetary windfall to the heirs of Henretta or other decendants of other cell lines.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie was OK.  Builds up to nothing... some people may really like it while others will hate it.  Not bad, but not as good as I expected.
0547884591|5.0|I've read and loved both of Tim's previous books. Surprisingly, The 4-Hour Chef is starting to become my favorite. I received an advanced copy of The 4-Hour Chef and was a little skeptical because I thought it was literally just a cook book of slow carb recipes. In reality, The 4-Hour Chef is really about how to learn and master anything.<br /><br />Why I like The 4-Hour Chef:<br /><br />1. It's beautiful. It's packed with gorgeous color photos and the layout makes it almost like a coffee table book that anyone can flip through and enjoy purely for the aesthetic value.<br /><br />2. The valuable content density is really high. There are tons of how tos, recipes, tips, charts, lists, and even maps of Tim's recommended restaurants in San Francisco and New York. Each section is really short and to the point. The book is almost like an almanac that you can go back and reference anytime.<br /><br />3. Meta-learning. Tim's books always seem to have one big idea that applies to everything. In the 4-Hour Body it was minimum efficient dose (MED). The 4-Hour Chef explains meta-learning, which is a game changer. One of those ideas where you think to yourself, \\"Why wasn't I taught this earlier?\\"<br /><br />The one other thing you need to know is that the book is HUGE. If you have an iPad, I can imagine The 4-Hour Chef being awesome, because it's so colorful. I don't have an iPad so I've been flipping through the hard cover. Once you've read the section on meta-learning, I'd recommend turning to the table of contents, picking sections that you find intriguing (like bacon infused bourbon). You can hop around this book, learn new skills and recipes, and really start to understand an apply meta-learning, which applies to far more than just cooking.
B005XQ973M|4.0|Like any book of this kind it's not a pleasant read but it is informative. For many of us older Westerners growing up in ignorance of the history which lay behind the iron and bamboo curtains, it is a reminder that no group of humans have a monopoly on attempted genocide: we'll all give it a go if the circumstances stack up.<br /><br />The analysis of the historical and cultural reasons behind both the massacre and the aftermath seems reasonably balanced and does not come across as overtly anti-Japanese, thereby giving it an air of reasoned argument rather than the bigoted rant that it could be.<br /><br />I would give it a 5 star rate but it's difficult to say you &#34;love&#34; a book about mass murder.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I love it. And is amaseing gun i love nerf. It's nerf or not thing love love love love love love
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I was familiar with the writings of Edgar Rice Burroughs having read and liked his Tarzan series, so I decided to go see this movie with my sons.  We enjoyed the movie tremendously.  Yes, the premise has been seen before but this is the source material that was written over a 100 years ago.  There are a couple of contradictions within the movie itself but they are easily overlooked with the fantastic story and beautiful visuals (we did not see it in 3D).  The comedic moments bring additional enjoyment to the movie but don't detract from it.  I would give this movie 4 1/2 stars but as the rating system doesn't allow it, I give it a 5.<br /><br />I purchased the 4 disk 3D Blue-Ray/DVD edition the day it came out and have watched it several more times.  I have now read the books and even though it is in vain, I wish for a sequel.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great Book.  A good read that was suggested by a friend and I am glad I bought it.  You should read this book.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Thought it was great in the very last scene how this prequel finished.  We have watched every one of the movies in the series.
B0086213XW|4.0|This movie is definitely an &#34;indie&#34; - rich on character development, quirky/charming personalities at odds with making their relationships work. Meichele Williams is excellent (as always) and Keith Rogan adds a nice comedic touch.
B009LK6JS2|2.0|I wanted to like this app but the lack of instructions coupled with an altimeter that doesn't seem to register mountains kinda ruined this game before I could really start it.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|I read the previous books and thoroughly enjoyed the storyline.  Not everyone is into vampires and werewolves so I can only share this experience with a few people who like these kinds of characters.  I thought it was great and can't wait to see the latest movie.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|With this book, the epic saga of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin begins. It introduces you to a world that you will never want to leave in ways that you'll never imagine. Stop reading this review and start reading this book!<br /><br />As a side note, this series was LONG overdue to get in to e-book format, and I am ecstatic about it!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app because all the puzzles are simple.They can be challenging if you make it that way by making there be more puzzle pieces.This app is cool because ALL the puzzles are puzzles with pretty pictures.They aren't like pretty their cute and fun.I do recomend you get this app. :-)
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following The Piano Guys on YouTube for a long time. A DVD would be best but the CD is super.<br />Check them out on youtube.
B00005JLCI|5.0|This is the best Hamlet film out!  It matches the play perfectly, and Kenneth Branaugh is an exceptional Hamlet.  It is long but perfect!
B008KE3960|5.0|A game you can play without having to buy extra gears to progress. Very hard to put down. I would recommend.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Totally impressed by this story of a mission gone bad, the moral delemia and remarkable survival of Mr. Luttrell,  excellent read, best book I've read this year.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|They can do no wrong....Not quite as good as Diamond Eyes, but extremely close...It's amazing that a band can keep getting better and better with time
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have read three of her books and would read anything she publishes. Character development is great. I zoom thru each book because the material is engrossing. There is always a neat, twist. The writing is edgy and current and just fun to read.
B003M696QS|5.0|This is an exhaustive study of NDEs.  I had an NDE when I \\"drowned\\" at the age of 5.  I am now nearly 82. Suddenly an unspeakably beautiful spectrum of patterns of light surrounded me (bright with rectangular patterns but easy on the \\"eyes\\"} It was a most peaceful loving presence remaining unchanging  for a \\"long time\\" before I returned to earthly reality with a terrible thud and then heard excited human voices and a banging on my body.  Today the clarity of the experience remains as strong as the day it occurred.  Consciousness  does survive death in all probability.  I am an anesthesiologist.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the flexibility and the functionality!  There are so many plans and versions to choose from and it is great for on-the-go study or reading at home.
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|This was a really good read and suspenseful right up to the ending.<br />Captured the war era,the sixties and right up to the present very convincingly.<br />As an older person who has been thru' all of those decades I could relate very well to the characters throughout the story.<br />Very enjoyable and would highly recommend for a good holiday read.<br /><br />Tks Sue
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Interesting, especially from a scientific point of view.  I think the story line from the family and medical staff's point of view was important.
B009E3EY38|5.0|A few weeks back, in anticipation of the DVD, I watched their press conference to kick off the release of the film. Robert waxed poetically, as only he can, about the physical and mental demands they were under playing in front of an audience. He talked about how important it was to get everything, down to the set list, right. He finished up by saying how proud, relieved and exhausted they were after their performance. They have every reason to feel that way.<br /><br />I've seen plenty of bootleg footage so I wasn't completely blindsided. Watching Youtube clips made with an iPhone is no comparison to Blu Ray and Surround Sound. As usual, it's tough to believe four guys are making all that noise. Robert defiantly delivered. John Paul Jones was steadfast and immaculate. Jason Bonham blended right in, but isn't the force his father was. But who is? Jimmy, ever the virtuoso, stole the show. Every note, impeccable and precise. There isn't anybody cooler than Jimmy Page. Standout tracks for me...In My Time of Dying, Nobody's Fault But Mine, and The Song Remains the Same.<br /><br />If you still think Robert Plant owes you something because he doesn't want to travel the globe signing songs he sang 40 years ago, it's time to let it go. Get the DVD. They wouldn't sound or look better if you were sitting in the front row at Madison Square Garden.<br /><br />*After watching and listening steadily for a week and a half I feel obligated to update Jason Bonham's performance from \\"blended right in\\" to the perfect guy for the job.
B009YU62H2|4.0|New Soundgarden sounds a lot like old Soundgarden and that's a good thing.  This isn't a nostalgia trip to the 90s.  Soundgarden's style always had a timeless appeal.
B009KHCT94|4.0|This is all about light hearted, obvious entertainment...big special effects, gorgeous cheese-cakey leading lady, hopelessly inept Nazi's....this is not great film, people, but it is fun.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good book and series, the books keep you wanting more .. I.would recommend to anyone.. fast and easy read
1936608618|5.0|This book is the best, most informative Endurance book I have found and I have read them all. Brian includes everything you need to know on Running, swimming, biking, nutrition, mobility and the list goes on- everyone should read this book- it is fantastic!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I was waiting for this book to be released with excitement as I too have had NDEs. I was excited because of who he is, his credentials would give him more credence than someone like me who works in an office. No wonder the networks & media, including IANDS, is placing so much importance to it. But...I came away from this disappointed. Eben doesn't go into the experience as much as he should have. It was a long NDE & yet we don't get enough of what happened, what he saw & heard. Does he not remember most of it, or is it that he has decided not to share, for his own reasons of which he has not divulged? Or, worse yet, are we to follow him from video to video or interview to interview trying to gleen more of what he experienced? Is this book a \\"teaser\\" & will he will be writing more later on, at which point he will divulge a bit more? As I said, I am disappointed in the actual amount of the NDE material he wrote about in the book. He can help so many people to understand, to not be afraid of death & to hopefully change some negative characteristics, by having told us more. Why has he held back? He was chosen to have this because of the impact he could have on so many.....Come on Eben....tell us more & don't drag it out. The sooner the better is helpful for everyone that is looking for answers. Don't keep them to yourself but truly share with an open heart. Thank you, for \\"coming out\\", for standing up & saying that you had this experience.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the app is great.  minecraft. is great on kindle fire but better on apple devices.  pocket edition goes from 5.00 to 7.00.  the Pc edition though goes for about 24.99 but its worth it
1449320104|5.0|I have been reading this book series since \\"C# in a nutshell\\" published in 2002. It is a great book to jump start with C# programming as well as upgrading your skill-set every time a new version releases.  This book explained the key differences between 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 on very high-level.  Added benefit of this book is to have specific chapters on advance topics such as parallel programing, threading, tasks, asynchronous patterns, Serialization, I/O and networking. Authors have explained LINQ in a greater depth (three chapters) including significant block diagrams to easily understand the execution fundamentals.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is beginner in C# as well as professionals upgrading their C# programming skills.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|this is an amazing game i love it soooooooooo cool i would get it it is for all genders and mosly all ages
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Loved the themes.  Billionaire with the funding to try and live forever.  A scientist that ponders her spirituality and its relevance when meeting her maker.  A team of mercenaries that live for the dollar and discovers that they have a moral obligation to protect humanity in the end.  Difficult to bring these story lines together under one plot but it was thoughtfully done so while still transitioning to the Alien ground zero story line.<br />The Director put the visual sci-fi secondary to the story telling.  Loved this film.
B000001DYJ|3.0|Because I have a copy of the Kissology 3 Concert that this was taken off of and the DVD sounds weaker in volume on the DVD than on the Compact Disc, is this a foul up with the audio in the arena in Auburn Hills Detroit Michegan or was there something wrong with the microphones on the night they recorded that particular concert? The vocals are toned down on most if not all of the songs because the actual music is louder than the vocals. I was listening to Domino off of this and you can hardly hear Gene's voice, what's the dealeo?
B009VB9VKY|2.0|Real slow in developing the main and supporting actors.  The end seemed to be a rip off of Saturday Night Fever.
0525953728|3.0|The book was about what I expected. Lots of press, but a not very impressive read. I was discussing the accusations of security leaks with this book with some friends. I decided to buy the book to see for myself. There is practically nothing, that warrants prosecution for leaking classified inforamtion in this book, in my estimation. I think I will stick wi Lee Childs books for a better read.
B000BHN7DE|4.0|I really love the chosen songs included in this selection.<br />She's truly one of my fave the fact that she's from Chicago.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Clearly not the most exciting book in the series. In particular, Daenerys' story is pretty lame. The whole book is pretty much just setup for the next one where (we hope) these stories will start to come together and move toward some resolution. If you expect a big payoff in the end, you will be disappointed but if you just enjoy the journey, well it's still not the best in the series but its certainly still a good read.
1419701533|5.0|My son LOVES these books, so I purchased this set for his birthday. He read all of these books within a week!

1936608618|5.0|I AM NOT A RUNNER, I DO NOT ENJOY RUNNING but it is of the utmost importance to run in order to achieve higher levels of fitness.  The thing that B Mac has figured out is how to make guys like me more efficient runners and the end result is I don't hate running as much bc I am better at it DUE TO BMac's teaching and instruction.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Baker

B000SVZIOE|5.0|It was just a great script in general..moving forward in all the right ways. The classic heros journey in a fun animated way with lots of fun witty references throughout. Well cast voice over work..just really loved it.  Watch it.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|The frozen Canadian stories are not as appealing to me as the ones that take place in the United States, um South Carolina, but still great reading.  I'm a huge fan of her books, and the TV show they spawned.  Brennan and Booth are great characters too.!!!
B000TERK3C|5.0|Ever Since KidA Radiohead just hasn't been the same.. still pretty good, but just not the same. This one takes me back to the days when they were great
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This historical novel is a plot-driven page-turner; however, the author could have done much better with character development. The result is many stereotypical characters without the subtlety that would make them come alive.
B0094U0RJQ|2.0|In considering Dylan's 1983 album &#34;Infidels,&#34; a reviewer remarked that Dylan had remade the distinction between what is and what is not singing.  That may have been true thirty years ago but I'm afraid that on &#34;Tempest&#34; Dylan has crossed the line.  That's understandable and I could deal with it, if the songs were up to Dylan's high standards, but for the most they are not.  I took a chance on &#34;Tempest&#34; because I'm a long time Dylan fan.  If &#34;Tempest&#34; is where he's at now, however, Dylan might consider taking a page out of Philip Roth's book.  I'm sorry to say it may be time for Dylan to  stop writing and recording and use his time and  energy for something else.
B009P5S11G|4.0|All I can say is that I love this woman's music.  I know a lot of people are giving her bad reviews on this CD, but I honestly don't agree with any of them.  What it comes down to me is that I like that she's taking her music into a different direction, like she always does.  She blends a bit of dubstep, electro, and hip hop and I find that every time she comes out with something new, it's NEW.  Unlike many other musicians who make the same stuff over and over and over again, Rihanna has a way of continuing to grow her music.<br /><br />With that said, yes there are a couple songs that aren't exactly my favorites, but overall the CD itself as a whole really works well and speaks a lot about her.  I know someone said something about how they missed the \\"Pop\\" feeling and was getting tired of all these slow songs.  To be honest, I'm glad that's what she's doing.  Rihanna could have become one of those pop drones and just made club music, which interestingly enough she has a few songs on here that can definitely fit into that category.  Either way this is my review, take it for what you will.  I do think this album is worth it, especially if you like Rihanna.  Other than that I'd say you should get the deluxe version because \\"Half of Me\\" and the remixes of \\"Diamonds\\" are pretty awesome.  I usually don't like remixes, but in this case I had to give her props.

B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Christina's new hyped album \\"Lotus\\" is truly a rebirth for her. We've been waiting for it since early 2011 when she went through a lot of backlash for the national anthem, weight gain, arrest and hundreds of weird rumours created by media about her life. So, you know very well that she had a lot to say on the new album about the last two years. It's quite obvious in songs like \\"Army of Me\\" (\\"So how does it feel to know that I beat ya, that I can defeat ya, how does it feel, 'cause it sure feels sweeter to me\\") which is characterized as \\"Fighter 2.0\\" by Christina herself and it's true that both songs are similar lyricwise. It's one of my favourite tracks! Another song about empowerment and feeling invincible is \\"Best of Me\\" (\\"Aren't you tired of throwing stones, trying to kick me when I'm down, but you'll never get the best of me\\"). Those two songs are representative of one of the album's main theme and concept of the unbreakable flower (Lotus) which survives under the harshest weather conditions, implying Christina has survived from all the backlash and hatred all these years and she's back, stronger than ever.<br /><br />The album also includes a couple, powerhouse ballads (\\"Sing for Me\\", \\"Blank Page\\") but they aren't as breathtaking as the ballads of her previous albums. I love \\"Blank Page\\", it's a piano ballad without a melody.. it's just Christina's vocals and her emotions. I truly appreciate Sia's talent and her work with Christina has always been amazing. Plus, \\"Light Up the Sky\\" is a beautiful mid-tempo song which is radio-friendly.<br /><br />The other theme of the album is LOVE, positivity and celebration. Standout tracks \\"Let There Be Love\\", \\"Red Hot Kinda Love\\", \\"Around the world\\". There are the fun tracks of the album and it's Christina's approach to mainstream music (\\"Let There Be Love\\" was written by Max Martin\\"). I love them because they make me dance and smile.<br /><br />Special mention to the Blake Shelton duet which is a country, soul, pop rock and adult contemporary song. It's so good, i didn't expect that! Their chemistry works and their voices go well together. Also, it's the next single!<br /><br />Christina recorded a song with Cee Lo Green called \\"Makes the World Move\\" which is fun and soul/jazz (old school music) but it is not a standout track. I wish they could release their unreleased collaboration called \\"Nasty\\" which was meant to be on the soundtrack of \\"Burlesque\\".<br /><br />Last but not least, i want to say that i totally enjoyed the songs for \\"haters\\" and \\"doubters\\"! \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"Circles\\" (explicit) are so freaking amazing and kickass songs! If someone is obsessed with you (in a bad way) and always makes bad comments about yourself, well you found the right songs to dedicate to them!<br /><br />To sum up, there are no fillers in the album, I mean none! Just some songs that are less good than the others so it definitely worth the money. In my humble opinion, this is surprisingly good and it is the best pop album of 2012. It is cohesive, includes awesome vocals and has a wide range of songs. Actually, i feel that \\"Lotus\\" includes songs that are representative of Christina's sound/lyrical style in previous albums: \\"Bionic\\" (Lotus Intro, Cease Fire), Back to Basics\\" (Red Hot Kinda Love, Make The World Move) and especially \\"Stripped\\" (Army of Me, Best of Me, Sing For Me, Circles)<br /><br />Thank you Christina for this album, it helped me a lot and i gotta say that i needed \\"Lotus\\" in my life especially at this moment.

0525958002|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter, a die-hard Duranie....it did not disappoint.  It is thoughtfully and beautifully written, describing the great and not so great parts of being a rock star.  A coming of age of a true musician.  I had to read it, of course, and it is a page-turner.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|We couldn't finish it. Yes. That bad. And it's not that I don't appreciate male eye candy! It's just that things like story, character development, plot, dancing talent and acting actually matter more to me.

B005I6EVUG|4.0|The manufacturer, Verso, advertises this cover as suitable for the Kindle Fire (not the HD version) and the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted a new cover for my Kindle Keyboard and this cover does fit. It also fits the Kindle Fire, but since the two Kindles are different in both thickness and height, the cover fits neither perfectly. It's snug on the Kindle Fire, and is a bit large for the Keyboard. However, on the Keyboard it is also quite snug -- the elastic bands hold either Kindle in place firmly -- I gave them both a good shaking to see if they'd fall out and they held fast. The bands leave all the buttons and connections accessible.<br /><br />The design is very attractive, a deep red with calligraphic writing (world city names) as a motif. There's a pocket on the inside for papers, but in the three years I've been using a Kindle, I have yet to use such a pocket for anything. There's no band or magnet or velcro to close the cover, and it doesn't have any protective padding, so it's not a heavy duty cover that will protect your Kindle from anything other than normal dust and wear.<br /><br />It's a good looking cover that does the job -- it works for me!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have a secret too.....I'm a HUGE Kate Morton fan, so I went into this new novel of hers somewhat bias.  However, that isn't to say I'm an easy critique.  With The Secret Keeper, Ms. Morton does not disappoint.  This book kept me guessing and utterly entertained true to form as her other books have. What I loved the most about this book was how it ended.  I pride myself on usually guessing the ending to a book, or at least having entertained the idea of how I think it will end.  Not this time.  She totally blindsided me, I had no idea, and oh how I love a suprise! Thanks for a wonderful read Kate Morton, and I hope you are busy working on your next novel!!

B004UC4HCG|5.0|Ingredients<br />I7-2700 3.5 GHz Intel<br />Corsair DDR3 16 GB<br />Samsung 120 GB SSD, 240 GB SSD and a 500 GB Barracuda HHD.<br />Installed everything last night with gloves on. Took about 20 minutues. First time for me to build a system. Processor just slips in and locks down. Cables easy to move around. You use the Shuttle cooler instead of the big fan Intel supplies.  16 gigs snapped in and I discovered the SSD can just sit under the bays for hard drives.  So now room for 2 hard drives, Bluray optical and SSD.<br />Boots in 12 seconds.  Windows experience rating of 6.3 (because no video card)<br />Putting all My Docs on 2nd HD and using SSD for programs.  Win 7 used only 12 gigs for my install.<br />Now with Office 2007 and a few other programs still just 15 gigs on the SSD.  Nice<br />I have an old Shuttle XP (10 years old) and just this summer the power supply died.  So Shuttle does make good machines.  I am hopeful this does the same.  Runs quiet enough, some small fan hum but not much.<br />So, totally nice, screams along with the i7.<br />Hum, sweet.<br /><br />2 months later update<br />Great system.  Fan noise is a low hum but not problematic.  What I like the most is the small footprint it has. Such a nice little box on my desk.  Never is hot and the exhaust fan air is always cool.  Boots in about 18 seconds now.  I look at my old 4 core processor as being so slow now.  And it was a good motherboard.  An i7 plus an SSD is so great.  I realize I could easily put another SSD in with 250 gigs and basically cover all my data on that.  There would be space for 2 SSD's and one hard drive easily in this box.  I run Skyrim on high rez and it comes out beautifully and that is with no video card.  I have all the data files of Skyrim on the SSD and so it changes screens very fast.  My other data files are on the HD.  With a lot of mods in Skyrim plus the OS and Office I am still just using only 35 gigs of the 120 SSD.<br /><br />One year later update<br />Still works just wonderfully.  I live in a hot place, temperatures upwards of 35 (100) and just swamp coolers for air conditioning.  So the HDs was getting hot (about 44C sometimes) which is not so hot but I like my machine to be cooler.  So I took the cover off and put a fan on top of the machine.  Now temp is never above 38.  As I am not in a temperate climate and without AC this is a good solution for me.<br /><br />Two years later with modifications<br />Ok, I spent a long time researching what video cards can go into this machine as it is a small case.<br />I finally bought a GTX 970 and I will explain what you have to do.<br />You need: 500 Watt power supply and the video card.<br />First step:<br />BIOS  You must upgrade your bios to after any 2012 version.  When you boot, check the date, if it is 2012 you need to upgrade.  You do that from the Shuttle site.  When downloaded the newer version of BIOS I put it on a bootable USB (bootable to DOS).  Boot up normally and hit F2 several times to enter BIOS.  Check you can boot off of your CD drive, then USB and finally your C drive.  Then save and reboot with the USB drive.  You type &#34;flash&#34; once you get a DOS window prompt.  It updates.  You then have to reset the CMOS.  There is a small hole on the back of the Shuttle that resets the CMOS.  The Shuttle Site has instructions on where to find that or how to do it.<br />Then if you are installing the GTX 970, it fits in easily enough but you have to take out the drive carriage (where all your drives are)  It just lifts out after unplugging the cables.  You need a 500 watt power supply which you had to install before hand.<br />Then snap in the GTX (I snap it in 2 or 3 times to make sure any grease or such is rubbed off the pins).  You put the two power cables into the GTX (you have to thread the power cables in a way to give you the maximum length).  Then bend the cables flat so the drive carriage will fit back in.  I had to do that several times to make sure it would fit.  Then fit all the screws, and boot up normally.<br />I did have a problem with it not booting but I just moved all the cables for the drives so they did not touch the video card and it booted fine after that.  Little fussing around to get everything fitting in right.<br />Now I have run several high video demanding games with the card and the SSD's heat up to 50 C fairly quickly.  I am thinking of putting another fan into it (which I have not figured out just yet) to run more air through the case.  If I am not running anything that demands a lot of video it is always at about 34 C.  Which is fine.<br />Ok, hope this helps people who want a bigger video card.  I do think the GTX750i would work too but not for Witcher 3, which is why I did this upgrade.<br />My machine has been excellent for more than 2 years.  Happy Shuttle buyer.bles for the drives so they did not touch the video card and it booted fine after that.  Little fussing around to get everything fitting in right.

1936608618|5.0|High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has become a well-researched, well-reasoned and more popular approach to fitness and conditioning. Brian MacKenzie, the creator of Crossfit Endurance and co-author of \\"Power, Speed, Endurance,\\" takes HIIT to it's logical extreme, virtually eliminating the use of \\"long, slow distance\\" (LSD) training for long-distance endurance events like marathons and triathlons. Instead, his training program<br />focuses on intense and heavy weight lifting like that found in Crossfit, and skills-focused sports-specific training. In other words, he's asking readers to really learn how to run, swim or bike correctly and efficiently, instead of spending hours in the pool or on the road putting miles under their feet.<br /><br />This is often tough for the distance-obsessed to grasp, but in the book, MacKenzie first clearly lays out his theories, supported by brief personal anecdotes (this is actually one flaw of the book I think he could address by citing more academic research), then begins his, and his co-authors' sections on skills and drills for running, cycling, swimming and mobility/stretching and diet. MacKenzie closes out with his Crossfit Endurance programming, which brings all of these separate pieces together into a single endurance paradigm.<br /><br />MacKenzie has smartly chosen a writer in Glen Cordoza, an experienced MMA author, to lay out his arguments and guides in well-reasoned, efficient and easy-to-digest format. He also worked with some well-known names in the Crossfit community for the various skill guides. And the consistency of effort and layout make it easy to flip through and find sections if a reader or athlete needs to go back to work on a specific skill. (For example, was having some trouble with my foot strike in running, and was able to quickly find some guidance on what the problems and solutions could be).<br /><br />I would highly recommend Power, Speed, Endurance to any endurance athlete looking to increase her overall performance, any gym rat looking to expand beyond the weight room while maintaining strength, and any swimmer, cyclist or runner looking for a way to shave seconds or minutes off his times.<br /><br />I followed CFE programming for about six months prior to a half marathon and PRd by 7 minutes. More importantly, I was able to maintain my (admittedly limited) strength base from two years of Crossfit training. I've started hammering these drills again this fall for a couple local 5K races after taking almost the entire year off from races. I'm psyched to be getting back into it and the timing of the book couldn't be better.<br /><br />Finally, I've followed Brian MacKenzie and Crossfit Endurance for the past couple years as a writer for ESPN and Muscle & Performance magazine, and believe his focus, attention to detail and years of tweaking his endurance formula will work. It will work for nearly everyone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There are more walkers out there, and it makes for much better television.  Last season was slow IMO, but this season has started off with...well, I was going to say the typical \\"bang\\", but there's no dialogue in the first few minutes, just zombie killing and running like hell.  The stay-alives come upon a prison, and, lots of zombie kills later, decide to stay there.  Lori and Rick are barely talking, and she's worried that the baby will be born a zombie.  If this first episode is any indication, season three is going to be AWESOME!  If you haven't watched Seasons 1 and 2, do so!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love playing. problem is putting it away to get things done. it can be challenging but not so much I give up
B00361CAEE|1.0|This \\"movie\\" is nothing more than a random bunch of video. It is an unedited mish-mash with no value whatsoever. It sounds like it would be good-but it really isn't. It is also boring. I bought it to show my fashion class,but I won't bother, I could barely watch this drivel.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille as DeMille is always - super on plot and character, though I'd like to know a little more about Kate.  The envue of Yemen is most interesting and predictive of the future.  Everyone should read this book to better understand what the world is up against.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|For me, this book is only interesting in terms of attempting to get some deeper insight into the characters after having seen the film. I'm not finding it much deeper, disappointed
B008YWY0HK|5.0|There aren't many kids movies today the whole family can sit down and watch without Mom and Dad (or Grandparents etc)wanting to shoot themselves.  For example, I can't watch Barbie movies with my daughter, I hate them.  I also can't watch most cartoons with her.  They just aren't interesting.  BUT, not only did I love this movie, my husband (and even tougher critic) also loved this movie.  My daughter got this movie as a surprise this week, not because she wanted it (though she did, she asked for it every time she saw a picture of Merida anywhere) but because my husband and I wanted it for ourselves LOL!!!  It's seriously a great movie, funny, and touching with a good lesson, and a little action in there too.  Just a really great movie all around.<br /><br />After reading a few other reviews, I thought I should add that if you are offended by animated butts, or bears eating \\"live\\" fish, this movie is not for you.  Also, if you expect a children's movie to be the movie of a century with sub plots and rhetoric fit to engender hour long conversations, this probably isn't for you either.  It's a feel good movie, perfect for a family with members of all ages, and a nice break from the Prince saving the Princess fairy tales we are used to.

B003UPEH8S|5.0|22 years on, and this is still my favorite album of all time.  Generally I get sick of old music and need to find new ground, but Rhythm is still on my Ipod along with music mostly written in this century.  I loved Graceland, but almost never play anything from it.  I think the challenge this album suffered was that there is so much depth and complexity it is hard to get on the first, or even third, listen.  There isn't a pop hook in it, other than maybe Obvious Child, but that is why it stood up to the test of time.  Buy it, play it 5 times without judging, and then tell me it isn't amazing.
1932100660|4.0|This book is a nice read with many information and some interesting facts. Would be great for research or just reading for pleasure if the topic is not too boring for some.
034580404X|1.0|I have never felt the urge to write a reviews on any books I have read before but after reading this book I was so disappointed I just had to find some way to express it.  Firstly I am not sure why this book is a best seller, there is no reason this book should be a trilogy (except for the fact that the author will make three times the money) because this entire story could have been wrapped up in one book easily, its as though she added all the repetitive sex scenes as a filler.  How many times do we really have to hear how fine Christian is or Christian telling Ana how beautiful she is, I mean this happens in every sex scene and its a lot considering they have sex an average of three times a day in the most inappropriate places.  The number of sex scenes were over the top and I soon found myself just skipping those scene to get on to the real story line.  I guess if the scenes were interesting it would not be that bad but there is so much repetition that you read one scene you basically read them all.  I was so excited to read this book because I was curious how she will incorporate BDSM and frankly it was uninteresting after all the hype.<br /><br />The characters lacked depth in my opinion and I really never felt like I completely understood why Christian was so messed up, yes she mentioned that is mother was a crack whore and her pimp beat her up and all that jazz but she could have cut out some of the sex scenes and spend a little more time to develop his character by telling us about his childhood, his time with Elena and how he ended up being self made a billionaire at the ripe old age of 27.  She also tries to make us believe that Ana is a strong woman because she defies Christian a couple of times and it really did not convince me, she just struck me as very childish.<br /><br />The book was also very predictable there was no surprises, I really was hoping to get a dramatic ending with something exciting happening but even that was disappointing, the scenewith Jack was so boring and unimaginative there was so much potential with the story line but the author did not capitalize on it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is one of the best mystery books I have read in a long time.  Well written found it hard to put down.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I chose five stars, because there are new twist and great suspense. Even some creepy moments! Fashion is always a plus. Love it
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This series is a must read keeps you interested all the way through. The people,  the stories for each family keep you wanting to find out more about them and what happens to them. The author has done a wonderful job!
B004XVMCMQ|1.0|I was shocked when I watched this version of Mansfield Park.  The insertion of a subject not addressed in the book or by the author anywhere at all is disgraceful and also pushed the limits in graphic detail.  I wouldn't let my grandchildren watch this version and I have told many of my friends not to watch or buy it. Not worthy of even 1 star.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Best space adventure movie of the year 2012 & future, untill the next movie in series comes along, I think!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I saw the movie for this book was released and I knew nothing of the story so I decided to read the book first since it got great reviews.  I found myself thinking throughout the book about the main character Charlie  &#34;Why is the kid crying all the time!&#34; But then when you get to fully understand his character you come to understand why he is so emotional and it all falls into place.  It's a good story about friendships and the hardships of being in high school, I would definitely recommend this read.  Without giving anything away I found that  I had to read the last few chapters over once more after I finished the book because Iwas a little more than perplexed and wanted to make sure that what I thought was happening really did take place!
B0098VXBIA|3.0|I wasn't impressed but it was an ok movie I guess.  I was hoping for more heart I think.  I am a sucker for movies dealing with pregnancy, babies etc so I guess I thought this would be right up my alley.  Nope, not really.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book with some slight trepidation as there were some strong opinions on here about the main characters Amy and Nick.  Some people really disliked them and thought they got what they deserved.  I am of the opposite opinion, I really liked this book and I loved how the characters got into each others heads and were trying to think three steps ahead of one another.  While I agree that when you get to the true nature of these folks they become very unlikeable I found that that's when the book really started to take off.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Very interesting and logical book about human technical advance and development, a comparison between developed and underdeveloped societies. It mixes history with a sound theory.
B005OP2928|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this show!!  There is not one episode that I think is not excellent.  the writing, wit, and humor in all of the shows is laugh out loud funny.  Love all the characters- Phil is my favorite, though!
B009VB7QQA|1.0|No spoilers:<br /><br />Horrible plot with the Civil War backdrop, special affects were cheezy computer graphics my 6 year old nephew could do.  Save time by throwing the money you were going to pay for this out the window of your fast moving car.  At least then all you are out is the money and not 2 hours of your life. I could go into greater detail about how awful this movie is but I would spoil it for those who truely want to never get 2 hours of thier life back.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Extremely engaging show.  Highly recommend... even my husband is obsessed!<br /><br />Fascinating how they weave the fairy tales in to one major plot.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett continues his story of lives made and broken through the early 20th Century.<br />The characters are believable & based in sound research. Follett does a good job of presenting both heroes & villains in a true light. The cruelty of war on the innocent is well presented & felt by the reader as is the ignorance of many of the upper classes. The European side seems to slightly more authentic than the American but this not deter or harm the story line or themes
B009NQKXYK|2.0|What a waste of a movie, it was lame and very very predictable, a total loser I told my friends not to waste their time and I am a SciFi nut
B002SWVC64|5.0|Love this movie.  Julia Roberts is fantastic.  Love that this is a based on a true story.  And such a great mix of drama and comedy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|great book why do you make this review so dificult to do why not just let us click on the stars
B000LGOPW2|5.0|This is by far not a scary movie but nice drama.  Its your typical dark Tim Burton and Johnny Depp movie.
B009VB998I|4.0|Watched the movie with my 8 year daughter, Absolutely delight to watch this kids movie. I used the streaming option, and the streaming quality was very good
B0064MGU98|5.0|Best TV series since Sopranos. Juliana Marguilies has a complex and interesting character.  Love Diana (the senior partner), especially when she snickers to herself.  Despite her outward appearance (serious), she doesn't take herself too seriously.  The other characters are also colorful, eg Stern.  They have a great assortment of judges.  Chris Noth's character understands contrition but he's no pushover.  Very good character development in Season 1.
B009P5S11G|4.0|This is the first album I bought of hers since Good Girl Gone Bad and I love it. I enjoyed every song. She's an amazing artist.
B003SI84D6|5.0|It is worth revisiting Tombstone, AZ seen through the eyes of Goerge P. Cosmatos. His vision is a revelation no matter what you think you know about what went down at the O.K. Corral. Prepare to not blink. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer throw themselves into the contemporary worldview with supreme confidence. You will be immersed in the conundrum Wyatt and Doc face. The experience is among the best uses of the cinematic crafts that I know.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Blast From the Past was a great film, It reminds me of the times when I was in school and we had these air raid drills and had to hide under our school desks or the whole class standing against the wall.<br />When the Cuban Missile crisis was going down, they were selling brand new Country Homes up in Thousand Oaks California with Bomb shelters in them. I remember going to the Country Cousins Super Market in Thousand Oaks and there was no food on the shelf's people were in a state of panic filling up two-three shopping carts of food, water, toilet paper it was like complete chaos.<br /><br />But the film just smacked of magic and that is because it was addressed directly to the \\"Imagination\\". Films like \\"Blast from the Past,\\" \\"Awakenings\\" or \\"October Sky\\" remind us of a time when life was much more simple and Slower back then, We had more time to realize that Life is a miracle, That just being alive was a miracle, Our mere existence was a miracle, We were dreamers back then, dreaming of a better world a better tomorrow.<br /><br />We don't dream anymore, we just reflect on the past, There is no more patriotism because there is more America, The Corporations have outsourced Jobs to China, Malaysia, Mexico, Japan, Cambodia and that is why there are so many unemployed people here in this country, It's not about being a Republican or a Democrat anymore,  it's about have & Have nots.<br /><br />Blast from the Past reminds us of a time when we pretty much had to live in fear of the Bomb. It also reminds me of Rod Serling's Twilight zone \\"The Shelter\\", There were family's that built bomb shelters for only two-three people enough for their own immediate family.

B001POX73C|4.0|This book is an enjoyable Regeny novel, but not among Georgette Heyer's best.  Some interesting characters and attitudes of the time. I loved the ending, for once I was surprised!
B00913DPW2|2.0|Not an easy game to play. It's rather confusing and the lack of instruction is frustrating. It's boring after a while and there are better games that do the same thing. But at least there's not much inane dialog.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I love every song on this album. Most times an album produces a couple of really good songs, but all the songs are great. Move over Michael Buble and Harry Connick!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I do not want to review this book. I do not know what I did to have this review request come up. I had ordered UNTO THEE I GRANT and still do not have it on my Kindle. Please take this review request off of my Kindle and please put UNTO THEE I GRANT in my Kindle. I paid for it and it does not show up.<br /><br />Thank you for your help.<br /><br />James Butts
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The first book is the best.  The second is still very good.  The last book starts to bog down a bit.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm fourteen. I read these books last year actually. I'm one ofthose girls who was obsessed with Harry Potter. Read all the books, saw all the movies. but the Hunger Games trilogy gave me a whole new perspective on the obsession of books. I'm the daughter of and English teacher so I'm always on the lookout for good books! Whem I first saw the book in my school library last year, my friends and I laughed and never thought we would read it. As it turns out we all loved them so much we've read them again! The story itself had me hooked from the start. As I've through the reviews om these amazing books, I've found myself angry at all of the negative reviews. I just can't believe that people didn't fall as deeply in love with these books as I did. I couldn't them down! Every chace I had I'd pull out the book at read it. This is a must read!!!!!! Disregard all negative reviews and start reading this immediatly!!<br /><br />-Grace
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is an excellent sci-fi/dystopian series.  Perfect beginning, the first novella is like a short story set in a world with one hell of a backstory.  Then the rest of the omnibus proceeds to flesh out the world, as seen by different characters.  Once the author builds up steam, though, watch out.  Very difficult to put down.  This is not just an indie author with a little idea, this story is rich and full and exciting.  I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Extreme bargin for many hours of play.  The self stick design keeps all pieces on the board. Great for any occasion.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|Great album with some really good songs that I loved seeing performed live. The whole album just reminds me of being on the shore line.
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is cute, funny and highly enjoyable. I love the twist on the classic story of Rapunzel. If you have kids, both boys and girls can enjoy this movie and the adults will too. It has all the things that make a movie attractive to all ages, good over evil, independence, happiness and love. And some great wordsmithing in the script and lyrics. Loved it.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|It really makes me sad to think that shows liek Daria are not around anymore and that shows that are for the mindless entertainment of the Britneys and Kevins of the world are all we have anymore. It was great going through the show again and remembering when my high school did millenium themes for everything and when the X-Files made you scared of everyone includiong your history teacher. Such a fun show that sadly reminds me of how the dumb people have taken over everything.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|...but I enjoy the music all the same. Fewer songs than on the OBCR for the Broadway show, but I still enjoy the songs, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
0547884591|5.0|I am an avid follower of Tim Ferriss---his first book, The 4-Hour Workweek, totally changed my life. It made me drop out of college, travel the world, and start a business online.<br /><br />When I first heard about his newest book, the 4-hour Chef, I was surprised---why? Does he want his audience to become cooks? Isn't that out of ordinary for him?<br /><br />But when I actually read the book, I found it to be completely different. it's as much about Learning as it is about Cooking. He discusses his process to break down skills into learnable tasks---and then actually do it.  In the first section of the book, Meta-Learning, Tim teaches the four steps he follows in learning any skill.  This is the DiSS DiSSS method. First, Deconstruction, then Selection, Sequencing, and Stakes.<br /><br />Deconstruction is breaking down any task into the minimal learnable units that I can focus on, Selection, which of those learnable units are the 20% that will give me the biggest results, Sequencing is how to order those units to learn as fast as possible. Stakes are how to set up a system that enforces consequences that will actually make me follow through<br /><br />Using this framework, the book teaches how to learn a language, shoot a 3-pointer, memorize a deck of cards----and much more. It's not just cooking.<br /><br />But even so, the cooking section in the book is fantastic. i've had the opportunity to create several of the dishes from the book, and I will say---small changes really do have a big effect on results. The chapter about herb pairings, for example, shows how small amounts of herbs can radically improve your dishes. 80/20 rule, for sure!<br /><br />Check it out---I promise you'll love this book.<br /><br />-Maneesh
B005UA0FLE|5.0|Michael Buble's smooth voice and big band sound bring a fantastic new push to excellent classics of holiday music. If you enjoy holiday music and a big band sound, buy this album, and buy it now.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|\\"Emma\\" exceeded my expectations! I loved this movie! This is one of the best romantic stories I have in my colletion. Gwyneth Paltro portrayed Emma to perfection! The on sreen sizzle between Emma and Mr. Knightly made the movie believable. I have since bought 2 other versions of the movie but they didn't come close to this version.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|...the movie adaptation was really good in its own right. I enjoyed the movie, though the acting was only ok, the music mash ups were enjoyable and even though the ending was re-written, I did like the ending. A lot.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this app being in the free column and saying free on every button you push; it actually costs money... although I don't know how much I'm not willing to pay fir a demo!!! WHAT WRONG WITH THIS!!!!!!!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book a lot and looked forward to getting back to it every night.  The main character is quirky with flaws (severe OCD),but basically a good person which I found to be refreshing when so many main characters are perfect unbelievable heros.<br /><br />The plot was easy to follow and believable. I will look for this author's books again.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This really helped me out when I was away and there was no alarm clock for me to depend on.  It is loud enough to wake you, but not make you jump out of your skin.  You can choose different alarms too.

B004SH40BQ|5.0|Wow, honestly this thing is great. It connects perfectly to my wireless earphones when i plug into my ipod, and it only takes about 20-30 seconds.
1607066017|3.0|I love Brian K. Vaughn's writing.  When I heard that he had a new series out and that it was getting a lot of good reviews, I was interested.<br /><br />I wasn't surprised to hear a lot of good things about this book and I got this trade as soon as I heard about it.<br /><br />You can just tell from the cover that it's going to be different.  A dude with horns and a chick with wings, nursing a baby.<br /><br />This is their story.<br /><br />The woman's name is Alana and the man's name is Marko.  Their civilizations are fighting a war.  Marko was captured and was being guarded by Alana.  At some point, they fell in love and Marko escaped with Alana.  Alana became pregnant and then they need to find a safe place to have the child.<br /><br />This is where the story begins, with Alana giving birth in an abandoned garage while there is a group of soldiers getting ready to kill them.  They are hunted because their child is considered an abomination.<br /><br />The visuals in this story are interesting.  Fiona Staples' art is decent, but what she draws has to be seen to be believed.  She takes human-robots with 1960's era televisions for heads, a ghost that is completely cut in half, and even throws in some heads with legs and you have some of the more interesting sci-fi creatures that I have seen in some time.<br /><br />The story itself is OK.  But, I am interested in picking up more of this series to see how it progresses.  So, I guess that would mean that I liked it.  Well, liked it at least enough to pick up a few more issues.
B0086213XW|2.0|I purchased this video given the character names involved in the production.  Not my best choice the movie was painfully long and equally boring.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I have watched Idol since its inception and been amazed, disappointed, surprised and mostly a bit of a cynic but Phillip Phillips has proven to be the exception to the rule. Other Idols have gone on to be mega-stars but he is the first Idol who should have been a runner-up with his indie style and laid-back charisma but instead actually won the thing and now has the music to prove why. Mega-star to be? Possibly but there is no doubt that his first album (mostly composed by the artist) shows a virtuosity, simplicity and capability crazy for someone of his age and professional background.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I started  the first book, read about 50 pages and tossed it.  My wife got this 2nd book and seems to like it.  I would hardly call it entertainment.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|My wife and I had lots of fun with this movie. Liked the actors and the characters they portrayed. Fun movie night.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I really cannot recommend this book enough!  There is a place for extroverts in this world, but being from the US where we over-celebrate the extrovert ideal, I have to say that I finished this book feeling validated and proud to be a \\"thinker\\".  This book presents a convincing argument demonstrating the importance of introverts in society, highlighting great accomplishments and great leaders that bear this trait.  It's not just a cheering session though, I was fascinated by the scientific studies done with children and in business and other settings kind of de-bunking generalizations we make as a society. The stories and real-people antidotes added to the book rather than feeling like a side-note as so often happens.  I think that introverts will particularly enjoy this book because it gives them the opportunity for introspection (we love it according to Susan) and extroverts will enjoy it if they have a loved introvert that they struggle to understand or deal with introverts in life and business and want to connect. I sometimes have a hard time getting through non-fiction even if I'm interested in the topic but this book read as quickly as a novel.  Fabulous!
0345525558|5.0|This was a great book. I would recommend it to anyone. I'll never look at a bouquet of flowers the same way I used to.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I bought this book for Kindle after loving \\"Gone Girl\\" by this author.  The stories are completely different, but had the same dark tone and type of female lead characters - very flawed which I like.  I will definitely recommend Ms. Flynn and continue to read the stuff she churns out.  If I hadn't known, I would not have suspected that \\"Sharp Objects\\" was her first novel.<br /><br />This story follows Camille as she is working as a crime reporter in Chicago and is forced to return to her hometown to cover the murders of two little girls in what is suspected to be the work of a serial killer.  I really like how the author slowly peeled back Camille's character and past.  After reading the first couple of chapters, I had a picture in my mind of Camille both physically and mentally and it completely changed as I moved through the story.  There are a lot of small-town exaggerations in this book (alcoholism, teenagers misbehaving, etc.) that happen in real life of course (I'm a small-town girl myself) but I found it a little too extreme to be believable.  That aside, I kind of figured out the killer mid-book and was still intrigued enough to forge on aggressively.  I read the entire thing in one weekend and immediately purchased her next book.
B009X01C64|5.0|Was looking for a nice case for my Kindle Fire 8.9 HD and decided on this one. Reasoning? Function. I'm still not excited about the price tag I paid when it was first available, but as it always is with new tablets and accessories, the prices start high and drop later.<br /><br />I got the case and quickly installed the Kindle into it. Played with it a little in terms of spinning from landscape to portrait, and all seems good. Another person said when its installed the plugs are inside, but thats not true on mine. I guess it depends on how you install it? Mine is, when opened like a book, the camera on the inside by the \\"spine\\". Perhaps I did it wrong? dont know, I'll find out later<br /><br />Nice that it turns the kindle from sleep/active by opening case, and has 3 nice preset locations for the case to dig into to stand  in either method. Wasnt sure before I purchased how secure it would be in the case but it seems good -- you slide into one side, and then it clips in tight on the opposite, so it doesnt have a way to fall out easily. Was pretty snug in there when I decided to install a different way.<br /><br />Seems like a good option so far, and is nice in black.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Not bad if you are into this kind of story.  Impossible to keep the 4,121 characters straight though.  I give him 5 stars for always taking the story in a direction i didn't expect. Only one star for how long and confusing the ride is to get there.
B007T99ENE|1.0|I have found this book to be boring and bland, I am struggling to finish it and have read 3 other novels while trying to get through this one. Very disappointed.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I love this! Original, interesting, great music! No trite pop American Idol drivel. I just hope he doesn't wait too long to record another one.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Because I live in the Pacific Northwest, I enjoyed reading about the places the author mentions. However, I became a little disenchanted with her inability to think of anyone but herself. Glad to know she found herself.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|You definitely need to practice a few times, but that is fun in itself<br />Thanks RORTOS for the fun and free entertainment
B000MV90JY|5.0|Personal and intense songs and the best voice Dylan ever. I bought in Vynil to hear in its original form.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Got this case after losing a headset and buying another. Works great to provide a little protection. Hoping it helps prevent me from losing another headset as well.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I think Dylan is ih his best days yet. I love Duquesne Whistle and Soon after midnight, two very different instances of what Dylan is able to do.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good read. Not his best work but enjoyable.<br />Lots of plot twists but not alot of excitement.Still, can't wait for the next book.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|The 3rd installment was, seemingly, scattered but it all comes together in the end!!! I thou rally enjoyed this series!! It's a great short series that I would recommend to any who love fantasy.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|Such a beautiful movie! No dancing or singing like other Shah Rakh Khan movies but it stole my heart. Shah Rakh Khan reminds me of Tom Hanks.  The one very sad part could have not been so final, perhaps just injury not death.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I love this book and have read it several times.  In fact I read and re-read anything by these two authors.  I love the way it turns angels/devils/heaven/hell/the Book of Revelations all upside down.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one of the best John Grisham books I've read in a long time.  It kept you guessing until the very end.<br />A lot of twists and turns and an unexpected ending.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very interesting plot line.  A lot of twists and somewhat of a surprise ending. But not convincing from a Black man's perspective. [[ASIN:0385535147 The Racketeer]]
038533348X|5.0|Upon reading the opening single-paged chapters, the book seemed to be a plotless synopsis. As I progressed however, the satire became evident. The fun poked at the details of the characters was simplistic, yet genius. I often felt like I misunderstood the novel's overall message with the gibberish terminology & the religious gimmicks, though I understood it well enough. Although I would have loved to see what happened after the end, the conclusion left me in shock. It was however one of the best endings I've ever read in a book. Everything I didn't catch on to at the origin of my experience seemed to connect. Vonnegut's criticism of society & their beliefs is evident. The characterization of some of his characters is somewhat questionable, but suitable for the novel's nature.<br /><br />In terms of plot, the novel narrates a journalist's quest to document what important Americans did the day Hiroshima was bombed, leading to an involvement with the fictional Dr. Hoenikker's controversial children which tangle the narrator into a ridiculous culture that circulates around themes like religious myths, false hope & the possible destruction of the world. The book is an overall fast & simple read definitely worth the time of anyone interested in a society-mocking volume.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this alarm every day. it works perfect for what i need. The fact that it is free makes it even better. I completaly disable snoozing because it is actually bad for you to wake up and go back to bed for a few minutes and get up again. all the features are just absolutly wonderful. Great app!
1444737112|5.0|A heart warming story about a broken man and a wounded cat who meet by chance and work to heal each other. It's how a not-so-ordinary cat saves the life of his human caretaker, making him less invisible and gives his life purpose. Their journey together is one filled with joy and love, and can bring you to tears. James Bowen's honesty about street life,addiction,the struggles of earning a living, and mending family relationships, shows how the most hopeless of situations can be turned around. It's the strength of the human spirit and the bond between man and animal. The story has a happy ending...but leaves you never wanting it to end.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read the first two books of \\"Fifty\\" in 2 and a half days - this final book took me a bit longer because it wasn't totally in step with the first two.  This one is more of a romance novel wrap up of the first two.  I personally love happy endings - this one was a happy ending, but I somehow expected more than just that from Fifty.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|This is the right book for anyone who wants to open their eyes to what is going on across the country and the world with regard to the torture and slaughter of animals for food. This book is based on real research, including the author's time working undercover at a factory farm. I don't know how anyone can go on eating meat, milk or dairy after reading this book. I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to open their eyes and their mind to the truth.
1426209584|5.0|Yous must OWN this book if you are interested in ornitology and nature. The images are well presented and the information and documentation is priceless.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It honestly just helps make my life simpler.. It's very convenient an easy to use anyone could use it. You'll love it
B003THHIEM|4.0|Okay, so being totally honest here: I do not want to like this show. I first stumbled onto it because I like Nathan Fillion (became a fan because of the Firefly series, which by the way, is really great Sci-Fi). This rating should really be 3.5 stars, but why quibble over half a star, right? First, the negative: this series is really formulaic: Filthy-rich, handsome mystery author Richard Castle decides to follow around super-hot (and smart--credit where credit is due), detective Kate Beckett and her NYPD colleagues to get inspiration for his novels. Because he is well-connected, he gets to follow the detectives around, even in very dangerous situations. Not very realistic, right? No. And of course Castle and Beckett didn't get along well at first. And of course, they now have a constant, though very manufactured-seeming, sexual tension throughout. It's like someone took every Buddy-Cop show cliche and wrote it into these scripts.<br /><br />But, you'll notice I gave it 4 stars (well 3.5, but who's counting). That's because I am a total sucker for decent &#34;Whodunit&#34; mystery shows. On some weird level, Castle and Beckett have a kind of Sherlock Holmes/John Watson thing going on--though at a noticeably lesser intellectual level--with the two of them constantly switching between the Holmes or Watson role. The observations and character development is not as good as the British &#34;Sherlock&#34; series (which is excellent, by the way), but it's good enough to be somehow simultaneously smart and mindless entertainment. At the end of a long day--and I've had a lot of them lately--watching an episode of Castle is just what I need. So, if the sitcoms you've been watching are a little TOO mindless, give this a try: it just might be the escape you're looking for.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is better that Fifty Shades of Grey...It is more realistic as far as the \\"loving scenes\\" and Gideon Cross makes Christian Grey look like a boy. I love, read both books in 2 days. Everyone at my job read both series and loves this one better. Both characters have issues, no one plays innocent.. It is AWESOME..cannot wait for the next one.
1936608618|4.0|This is an excellent book which covers all facets of endurance training.  It discusses everything from mechanics and nutrition to mobility and training program design.  While you may be able to find other running, swimming or cycling books, you will not find anything with this much information on ALL facets of training.  If you are not familiar with pose running, this is your book.  Do you know how to take care of your body through mobility work?  That doesn't mean old school static stretching, but legitimate body work for preventative maintenance.  If you do not, then this is your book.  Even if you do, it is hard to remember everything and in this book it is all laid out for you.<br /><br />Bottom line, you cannot beat this book as a quick reference for anything endurance.  A first time runner, or a seasoned vet can understand and benefit from this book.  I guarantee there are things in this book that you have never heard of that will make you a better endurance athlete.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B007EECSFA|3.0|somehow this story misses on suspense and gets tedious. I did manage to plow through it - my only reading material on a long trip. and the ending is stunning.

B0052RDHTM|1.0|The story telling did not live up Follett's renowned expertise. He moves the story along through parlor conversations and it's hard to care for any of his characters. I'm an avid reader, but I had to stop reading this book. it was not compelling.
072325804X|5.0|Love love love this one! Pictures are beautiful!
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|Joe Johnston has done it again, managing to take what SHOULD be great action flick material and managed to make it, well, boring.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the film started out quite well. The change from puny wimp to super hero was well done, as was the intro sequence with red skull. The whole nazi-mysticism mystique was done very well. But it seemed that after Joe Johnston filmed these two or three well thought out portions, the rest of the film was just filler.<br /><br />I caught myself looking at my watch a few times, just sort of wanting the movie to end - and this was at the 1/2 point of the film. The action sequences are fairly average for the most part and I really never got that \\"edge of my seat\\" feeling as the characters faced peril.<br /><br />All in all, an above-average film which could have been great if someone with better directing chops had been chosen.
034580404X|4.0|I bought the trilogy rather than just one as I almost always read all of a series once I start one.  I am so glad I did!  I couldn't stop until I finished the set.  I give it 4 stars rather than 5 only because some of the prose doesn't flow well.  It's a good modern romance and thoroughly enjoyable.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in adult relationships.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this wonderful book to my nine-year old daughter recently, and then bought it for my 13-year old nephew.  They both loved it as much as I did.  It is one of the best children's books I have ever read, but it is thoroughly enjoyable and engaging for adults as well. If you want to start a discussion with your child about what it means to be kind, start here.  You will not be disappointed.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I wanted to read this book since some of my friends have claimed it as their favorite book. I also wanted to read it before the movie came out. I enjoyed it but wanted to warn parents that if your young teens want to read it, you may want to chat with them about some of the topics - drugs, drinking, sex, rape, domestic violence, molestation, depression and mental illness. That said, these are not topics that young adults should be kept from, in my opinion and they are handled decently in this book. I wouldn't say it's a new generations \\"Breakfast Club\\" as some advertisers said, but it's good high school drama.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Was it the best book I ever read? No!  Was it still a good read?  Absolutely! I am completely satisfied with the flow of the story, the details and descriptions, as well as the overall content and theme. The metaphor were a bit loose and the story progressed a little too quickly but the story still captured my attention. It left me with lingering questions, the kind the entice not irritate. I feel satisfied yet hungry all at the same time. Good read.<br />,
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a page turner...I loved it...until the ending. I did not like the ending...unless there is a planned sequel. A sequel would make a whole lot of sense on the way this book ended...ugh!!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|luv this app sooooo much<br />luv how it works too<br />especially the simplicity of the app<br />it is sooooo amazzzzingggg !!!!<br />I definitely recommend it for everyone
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I got this cover after using [[ASIN:B008ULPBJG Verso Trends Darwin Croc Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\\", Red (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\\")]] and [[ASIN:B008ULPERA Verso Trends OMG! Duct Tape Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\\", Neon Pink (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\\")]].  I like the \\"Red Croco\\" style better for work, but, I like this Marware Vibe Standing case a little better.  1.) I like the strap that is on it to keep it closed, 2.) The standing feature helps.  I also noticed that this case is maybe 1/4 to 1/2 inch smaller all the way around.  So, to me, this case is thin/compact.  The one thing I wasn't excited about, and I think you will run in to this on all \\"standing\\" models - is that I put the camera at the \\"top\\" when standing, but that means the USB jack ends up in the binder of the cover.  Typically I like to keep the cover shut and stash my Kindle out of the way when I'm charging it up.  I don't use the camera much, so mounted it with the camera down and the usb plug exposed (in a horizontal position).  I thought this was a nice cover and good quality.

0307346617|5.0|Not sure what those 1-star reviewers were reading, but I thought the detail in this book was amazing. Everything from the psychology to the politics, the high-tech (but useless against Zombies) weapons, the people on the Space Station while all of this was going on down on Earth below... Wow! So much I never thought of or considered before and much more believable than any other zombie story or movie I've ever seen. I initially thought this was going to be a comedy, since it is written by Mel Brook's son, so I was quite shocked and pleasantly surprised to find how serious Max Brooks takes his novel. And Max has picked a unique way to tell a story, showing different cultures, different personalities and Max has clearly done his homework with regards to geography, history and even weaponology. My only regret is not reading this book earlier. I saw Max Brooks on a TV episode of Sons of Guns where they were building the ultimate Zombie gun, but it wasn't until I recently saw the movie trailer for World War Z (with Brad Pitt) on the internet that I decided to order the book and see what all the fuss was about. I don't see anything recognizeable in the movie trailer from what I read in the book, and the zombies in the movie trailer movie much faster than the way they are described in this book. Not sure if this is a complete re-write with a different take on the story or if it follows one particular person interviewed in the book, but I do know that I will definiately be seeing it in the theatre when it comes out this summer 2013.<br /><br />If you like military strategy, psychology or are a gun enthusiast, I think you will enjoy this book, even if you're not a Zombie fan.
B007MDB548|5.0|I love the idea of the box sets digital copy and all my only grief with this movie that it is so short
B006LSZECO|4.0|Love hate relationship with this book.  It was a little dark for me and it was also a little predictable until I got into the second half of the book and then I was hooked.  Loved that every other chapter was a new point of view.  Had a hard time putting this book down and even recommended it to my husband- and we rarely read the same books.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I love this game so much it is super fun and I can play this game to just pass time I love all the cute dragons their super cute I wish they wouldn't grow up!!!!!!!
B0098VYKSA|5.0|This is a enjoyable lark of a film with beautiful scenes, fun acting, and effects, which complement rather than overwhelm the movie.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Been waiting what felt like forever but it was totally worth the wait! It was all epic music a must listen.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|I don't really know what needs to be said about this. It's Batman Legos. 2 of the coolest things ever. The only things that would make this more cool would be if the Batwing played Elvis songs on the radio while flying over women in lingerie.

B009KKLQVS|3.0|For those of you who like me grew up with the Beach Boys, I've been waiting for one of their concerts to show up on Blu-ray for quite a long time.  Read many of the other reviews prior to ordering and thought I had a pretty good idea of what I would be getting.  As an owner of many concert Blu-rays reproduced on a properly configured home theater system, it's pretty easy to discern the difference between one title and the next.<br /><br />Visually I would rank this 5 stars and absolutely one of the very best Blu-ray concerts that would make a great demo for your display.  According to the credits, directed by Joe Thomas, probably of Soundstage fame and overall, the camera moves and cuts are perfect for the pace/beat.  Brightly lit, warm vivid colors, deep blacks with no crush, wonderfully broad contrast ratios and perhaps more detail reproduction than the older members of the band may have wanted on their individual facial close-ups.  As good as I could have ever hoped for.<br /><br />On the other side, the 5.1 Dolby HD Lossless soundtrack is another matter.  Being around the same age as the original group, I too can't do what I used to 50 years ago so I understand the whole mix was compressed around their vocal limits of 2012.  Good surround activity puts you right in the audience as expected from an audio mix from again, Joe Thomas, but there is less \\"energy\\" in the overall sound when you look at the number of performers and instruments in support of the original Beach Boys.  The \\"punch\\" in the total sound just isn't there.  LFE doesn't extend very low and while you see the drummers, the proportion of their efforts just isn't evident in the final mix.  Just compare the available bass over the end credits with what's on the majority of the tracks and you'll immediately understand my point.  Same with the high end...there isn't much almost as if it was all rolled off during the mix which is why most of the concert has almost a muffled tone to it.  Kind of like the difference in sound between AM (the norm where the band first achieved airplay) and later FM radio.  Mostly ends ups sounding all lower mid-range with limited dynamics most likely to prevent overwhelming the available vocals from the band members.<br /><br />Is it still a fun watch?  Is it a good as we remembered? Is it worth owning?  Yes to all, but it could have been so much better with more a aggressive (complete) overall mix which is primarily the cause of my 3 star average overall rating.  Compare this title to a couple of my reference concert Blu-rays (Duran Duran's [[ASIN:B007XNAPNY A Diamond in the Mind: Live 2011 [Blu-ray]]]; Lindsey Buckingham's [[ASIN:B005M26ZAA Songs From the Small Machine - Live in L.A. [Blu-ray]]), and the shortcoming become obvious as to what's missing similar to [[ASIN:B0030BOCKU Neil Diamond: Hot August Night/NYC - Live from Madison Square Garden [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />And almost adding insult to injury, when was the last time you purchased a concert (or even movie) on Blu-ray and found there is \\"NO Pop-up Menu.\\"  That's right, you can't call up a menu listing of the individual songs whether from the Main Menu screen or when the actual concert is playing.  While it lists Mike Love of the Boys as one of the producers of the concert, my guess is that someone else at either David C. Levy Productions or BlastMusic made the decisions for producing the final Blu-rays.  Can't imagine adding direct access to the individual songs would have cost that much more to implement when encoding this title.<br /><br />Beach Boy fans like myslf will still welcome having this remembrance of their 50th Anniversary concert but it could have been as really special as the occasion was with just a little more thought and planning ($$$) spent on the final package.  As another reviewer wrote, rather spend a few dollars more and have the whole concert (50 instead of the 21 songs here) than to save a little for a whole lot less which this effort ended up being.Too bad the rights owners didn't realize a reference quality product like this would have been an evergreen title selling over long periods of time more than recovering their small added initial investment.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This one is more difficult than the other Angry Birds.  You need to plan for several variables within each level as you go.  The effects of light sabers, using the force,  Storm Piggies and their guns etc!!!  Yes, you can pay for an upgrade in the game.  I wasn't super happy about that, but i did it, i really don't think 5 dollars total (game and upgrade) is an outlandish expense for a few hours of fun.  After completing it I always go back and try to get 3 stars on every level.  I rarely buy games, but when I do, I do it to enjoy them, not to race through see how fast I can finish and then be done with it.  This is an enjoyable game, with varying levels of difficulty within the game.  4 stars only because I thought there were going to be more levels.  Although it does not say there is, I was hoping for a level (scenario) for every movie.
B009DT98RK|5.0|A must for all Frampton fans.  Best concert mix that really puts you in the audience for a great stroll down a memory lane of 35 years ago.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Let's be clear. John Grisham is a wonderful writer and his book sales prove it. That said, this book is not his best. It's very entertaining, however.
B00004WQ3A|5.0|With the purchase of my new record player came the purchases of some of my all time favorite albums.  Downward Spiral has always been at the top three of the list.  This review will only cover the item itself and not be a review of the music.<br /><br />To my understanding, this is a reprint of the original record.  I have seen images online that the disc itself had the actual printing of the TDS Russell Mills paintings, but this edition has all black records with just the label being small portions of the paintings.  Another difference, I believe, is that this is spread out over four sides, listed below.<br /><br />The packaging is nice.  There are much less images than you will find in the CD booklet.  The sleeve is a book fold (salt with teeth painting on the inside) with side loading compartments and then a sleeve for each vinyl.  There is one picture on each (feathers/blood and NIN logo) with the lyrics and song information printed on the back.<br /><br />The sound quality is impeccable, and it is evident that a record such as this was designed for vinyl play.  A beautiful item!<br /><br />A1: Mr. Self Destruct<br />A2: Piggy<br />A3: Heresy<br />A4: March of the Pigs<br /><br />B1: Closer<br />B2: Ruiner<br />B3: The Becoming<br /><br />C1: I Do Not Want This<br />C2: Big Man with a Gun<br />C3: A Warm Place<br />C4: Eraser<br /><br />D1: Reptile<br />D2: The Downward Spriral<br />D3: Hurt
B008J34466|5.0|My wife and I have all of Pink's albums.  This one has some great songs that have not been played on the radio.  \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\" is easily my favorite duet of hers.  Nate Reuss and Pink really sing well together.  Next to \\"Funhouse\\" this is our favorite album.  Pink demonstrates excellent range and alters her voice to fit her music about as well as any artist out there.  I highly recommend getting the whole album.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Although I had seen this on best seller lists, it just didn't appeal.  However, it was recommended by an acquaintance and what a great read.  The power of letters is amazing.  We may lose that with the ease of communication through technology. However, I wouldn't give up my Kindle.  BAB
B00A77II0U|5.0|I love the hidden object games. this one is definately one of the best ive played and I play these types of games all the time
1401324649|5.0|I'm hardly ever disappointed reading an international best seller and this was no exception.  It made me smile and made me think of the dear ones I've known who would have done anything to find a window, climb out, and disappear.  I've given this books as a gift.  I'm smiling just thinking about it.  BAB

B007SGM084|3.0|I forced myself to finish book one just hoping it gets better but I've heard from several others that it's the 2nd & 3rd book that make the series so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt for now & give it 3 stars but I'm not dying to read the other 2...
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We couldn't stop watching and are anxiously waiting for season 2 to come out. Considering it being an online streaming purchase, the quality was really good.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|As spectacular as their first album was, this comes pretty darn close to meeting that incredibly high bar they raised!  Any M&S fan will be happy with this purchase.
B005BLYSQK|5.0|More than excellent! The music is sublime and the interpretation of the great pianist Mr. Schiff  is splendid. He is very connected with Schubert's feeling.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Whether you've seen the many other movies leading up to this one or not, you will still LOVE this movie, you can't help it!  But I do recommend watching the others first just so you catch all the &#34;in&#34; jokes :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|There is only one slight complaint I have about Pinterest and that is that occasionally the pins take you to links that are no longer there or sometimes they take you nowhere at all.. But its quick and easy to get over because there are so many other super spectacular pins to find on there!!!

B002Y7HGDQ|5.0|Late starting to watch this series as I don't watch many horror movies, but this one was a fantastic movie to watch around Halloween.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This is a very smooth flight simulator with nice graphics. The simulator is fun and fast. I am glad that I got this app.

1451695195|1.0|I now know more about the brain shutting down than the good doctor's NDE.  He was so vaugue in description of the afterlife.  I would have liked to have read more on what he actually saw.  Seven days in the afterlife and this is all he returns with?  Very disappointing read.
B006VREHRS|5.0|If you like show during early 20th century and to do with prohibition, this is a show you must watch. Well worth the time
B009FZHYKU|2.0|Season 2 was about the worst show I've ever seen. Season 3 is better but its still awful. Amateur hour on amc.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I have a set of Koss DJ-100s that need amplified for the best sound, so after reading the reviews on other sites, I decided to get the Fiio E6.<br /><br />The E6 is small, approximately the 1.5\\"x1.5\\" and it comes with a few plastic belt clips. The equalizer has three settings -- normal, bass enhancement, and low voltage. I found the bass enhancement really helped with the relatively neutral bass response of the DJ-100s.<br /><br />Overall, a good amplifier for a really great price.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|If you loved the previous album you will love this one. I bought the Yearbook edition because it was the only thing in stock. The yearbook edition is a cute book with pictures of the boys - honestly I'm not interested in that, as I only love their music and I would've preferred the Take Me Home album cover than the yearbook edition. However, if you know anyone in your life who is a huge fan or is younger I think they would appreciate the Yearbook edition as it does have a bit of extras like commentary and pictures. A must for a 1D collector!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This was a good story with wonderful acting.  A good movie for all: a little of everything, comedy, drama, and an interesting story.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|People who have biased, unfounded opinions on One Direction (besides the fact it's cool to hate on them) should review this album. Especially if they claim that \\"they'll never buy the album\\". It's a product review, and if you don't have the product then don't review it. Simple as that.<br /><br />I used to actually hate One Direction because I thought it would be like Justin Bieber or the other fabricated pop music out there. Yes, it is pop music and it's \\"fabricated\\". I grew up in the BSB/N'Sync era and I wasn't really into the BSB or N'Sync for some reason. My friends kept pressing me to listen to One Direction and I immediately became hooked. Some songs on this album I don't like so much, but there's my favourites like \\"One Thing\\", \\"Moments\\" and \\"Another World\\".<br /><br />They're not the epitome of music, but if you just want to mindlessly listen to pop music this album is great. At $5 too it's a steal, I bought mine for $10 at HMV - though it's worth every penny. I still listen to this album even if I have their newer album!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As alway John Corey is my hero. Taken from todays headlines, The Panther is a fast paced story and all so true. It may be fiction,but it hits close to home. It's great to have John Corey watching our backs. Nelson DeMille is a wonderful writer, Love all of his books.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As expected, another great read from the master.  We've come to expect lawyer-makes-good, then ends up poor.  But here we have a black lawyer who starts out not only poor, but in prison.  How he becomes a free man is only part of the story, which is full of unexpected twists and turns.  Delightful!
B007V65R54|4.0|Mr. Silver makes a distinction between the two early in the book, but uses them interchangeably most of the time. That makes some of his more subtle analysis a little hard to follow, and it could have been improved by a meticulous copy editor. His track record in the political arena speaks for itself, and a look behind that work is worth the read.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Many scientists, doctors, and lay persons write off Near Death Experiences as hallucinations or wishful thinking.  But here we have a neurosurgeon with more than adequate proof of life after death.  Using his own brain scans to demonstrate that ordinary thought processes did not exist during his own days-long coma, Dr. Alexander gives a remarkable and vivid account of his tour of Heaven.  What amazed me the most is the fact that God must have allowed this NDE to happen to a person uniquely qualified to translate his miracle into a vehicle to convince doubters:  life does not end when we leave this earth.
0547884591|5.0|I received an advance copy of the Four Hour Chef (FHC) and upon opening the shipping box I thought \\"Ok, Tim did a cook book.\\"  Well...it's a bit more complicated than that. What Tim did is use the art/science of cooking as a modality for sharing his learing techniques. This is transferable job skills at their best as the same methodology that helps learn a language rapidly (focusing on the 20% of material that is used 80% of the time) will also help one navigate the the kitchen. In many ways this is the book that should have preceded the Four Hour Work Week. As good as that book was (and is) it does not explain the methodology employed nearly to the extent covered in the FHC. So, if you have any interest in cooking and food, you will love this book. If you are interested in living an optimized life and streamlining the learning process of damn near anything...again, you will love this book.
B006ZZANDI|1.0|In 20 years, when you're in your 30's and think back, \\"What was that crappy band I used to love?\\" The answer is One Direction.<br /><br />Pro:<br />No gingers<br /><br />Cons:<br />They're bent

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I first found out about Alter Bridge thru WWE Superstar Edge, Who was using AB Metalingus that is on the album One Day Remains (Not Blackbird). I bought that album about a year ago and decided to get another one about 2 weeks ago. I did not know if I would like this one or not. But I took a chance and bought AB Blackbird. Lets just say I wished I would have got it sooner. Its great! I love it. My 2 favorite songs are Ties That Bind & Blackbird. I would recommend this to anyone who a fan of Alter Bridge and Creed. But I can only say good things about this album. There is not a single bad thing about this Album. It deserves 5 star rating. I hope this was helpful.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is just one fo those books that holds you from the first page. The lead characters are just a lot of fun to get to know and the plot is witty and sexy. I cannot wait to read the book from the male leads point of view.
B00846REIS|1.0|1.horrendously poor writing (cringeworthy)<br /><br />2.sophomoric characters, every one of them, by the way, who happen to be good looking -a fact which is repeatedly blasted to you by the author on nearly every page : \\"ohhh~~he was so beautiful ~ , ohh he was so tall and dark , ohhh he was so attractive\\" x 100000 WE GET IT FOR LORD'S SAKE!!!<br />take away the 'striking'(can this word be more over-used for the male figures in this sort of book??) good looks, the supposedly 'very important' exeutive position he holds at 27 or something,( although judging from the level of indsutriousness & intellect - or lack it - demonstrated by his persistently predictable and juvenile shennanigans I don't know how in hell he manages to even make a living ), the bank account and the glamorous apartment and nothing is left but a very mediocre couple of people with no special attributes whatsoever<br /><br />3.ridiculous plot full of juvenile crap that just makes you cringe -this is supposed to be romantic?? how depressing...<br /><br />refunded the stupid thing after skimming through 2-3 chapters - would be mortified to be caught with this atrocity on my kindle<br /><br />can't believe the attention this level of writing has actually managed to receive<br />seems to be a result of some sort of collective dumb-down of society<br /><br />but overall, the greatest flaw of this book lies in its utter and unashamed<br />lack of originality. basically, it's nothing more than a cliche-d compression of all the superficial values promoted by modern pop culture based on promiscuity, superficiality,<br />sensationalism and looks, looks, looks and MORE LOOKS

0547884591|5.0|I read an advance copy of this book, and was delighted to discover that while it gives an incredible depth and breadth of knowledge about food and cooking, the real recipe is meta learning.  I am going to use the book to learn Spanish - something I've struggled with for years.  Who would imagine a cookbook could be versatile enough to do this?<br /><br />I am typically a slow reader, but as with Tim's other books, I just could not put this book down!  I bought 25 copies so I could send them out as holiday gifts.

034580404X|4.0|I recommend researching the author and excerpts of this series prior to purchase; if you are unaware of the intent you will miss the point of the books.  I found the series to be easy reading and would recommend it to serious discussion groups.  My rating is based on the few writing errors noticed in the books -- but honestly none of us are perfect.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I still haven't gotten the hang of it yet, so I'm not too excited about the game. I like Angry Birds much better.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|It is hard to believe that Kelly has been around for ten years. Her music moves me. \\"Miss Independent\\" is my favorite song.  This song may be intended for a woman, but the funky groovy tone appeals to a man like me. \\"Breakaway\\" is the most uplifting song of her career.  I think this song is very empowering.  Kelly sings about having a broken heart better than anyone. \\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\\" and \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" would have to be my favorite heart break songs in recent years. \\"A Moment Like This\\" and \\"Stronger\\" are two songs that make me feel better about my life. \\"Because Of You\\" is the most beautiful song about the negative aspects one person can have on another person.  \\"Don't Rush\\" is a new song to me.  This is one of those song that becomes an instant classic.  Vince Gill duets with Kelly on this song.  Their voices sound great together.  \\"People Like Us\\" is another new song to me.  This is an upbeat song that infuses me with energy.  This song reminds me to stay postive every day of my life. \\"Already Gone\\" is a beautiful song about a relationship that did not work out. Kelly soars vocally hitting some high notes here. I enjoy this greatest hits album very much.
1609611543|3.0|The author of Wheat Belly claims that eliminating wheat from your diet will help you to lose excess weight and get rid of a laundry list of health problems. After three years of living wheat and gluten free, I'd like to share my perspective.<br /><br />I was incredibly irritable and cranky for the first 3 weeks living gluten free. It was like PMS +.  I think my strong reaction was an indicator of a significant issue, and my body was protesting while undergoing detox. I lost ten pounds *snaps fingers* like THAT! The weight loss stopped there though, despite the fact that I really wanted to lose another 10 pounds or so. I noticed an improvement in general health after going off gluten, though it is hard to quantify what exactly changed. I believe that my ADD brain felt less \\"foggy\\" and I experienced fewer colds and sinus infections, but I didn't keep records before and after, so my perception may not be totally accurate.<br /><br />My body started reacting harshly when I \\"cheated\\" by having a slice of pizza or homemade bread. After a year, I realized that it wasn't worth it to eat these foods if I was going to be nauseous for 2-3 days afterwards. So I am still pretty strict about being gluten free.<br /><br />I gained back the weight I'd lost after 6-8 months. I guess my body adjusted to the change in eating habits and my metabolism slowed down.<br /><br />End result? I think that wheat is a serious problem for many, a significant problem for some, and maybe a minor issue for others. People are so different- I don't think any one solution is going to make everyone feel better and lose weight. For those who are willing to try a different way of eating, this book may prove helpful. If you are looking for a miracle cure though, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.
B004TTHLBE|1.0|Kept waiting for something to happen or some more interesting characters to be introduced... and it just doesn't happen.  Do not recommend move on..
1416549447|4.0|I am not through the book yet, but so far great changes ahead for me! the background in the beginning is dry to read, but worth the extra time.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|To those of you confused by why some paid $2.99, it is because G5 games are 40% off the first day or two the game is released like a promotional price if you will. I've played every HO point &amp; click adventure game by G5, Alawar, Big Fish, Mumbo Jumbo, Playtinum, some from Anunam(?? I think that's the developer's name), and others who created The Haunt games ,Grisly Manor, Lost Circus, etc. You can say that I'm a sucker for a good adventure game. So I think I'm a great judge of what makes a good adventure game, and this one is one of the best if not the best. This game graphically is incredible. I played the more challenging mode, which I recommend or else the games are too simple. On the more challenging mode, you are not told what areas are important on the map nor do the areas within the room you are in light up. The only thing that twinkles are the hidden object areas. But trust me, it is soo much more fun when every move isn't pointed out for you. The mini games are not very challenging but they are still enjoyable. One cool twist is that instead of finding object in the hidden object area you can play Mahjon or however you spell it. I did not try it as I like finding the object, but I still think that is a neat little twist. I only paid $2.99 as I bought it the day it was released but this game is worth the $4.99 price tag, hell I think it's worth more then that. This game is so amazing and I recommend it to all you adventure game lover's and if you have never played a HO point &amp; click adventure game before then please let this be the first. Don't let the price stop you from playing the full game. Enjoy!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Beetlejuice is a treat for young and old. My family can watch this movie over and over. One of my personal favorites of all time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great app. the numbers are big and its accurate.I would highly recommend this app for everyday use.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Even though I loved the entire trilogy, I pick this one as my favorite. You learn a lot more about the characters and see a side of Christian you never thought you would. And another side of Ana too. It's a love story with twists and turns and the usual kinky stuff Christian has got us all used to!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I am not one to spend $5.00 on an app.  But I must say that after playing the free version (and lets face it I knew that this was a trial) I was completely intrigued by the amazing graphics and story line. Well worth the money. I find this app worth the money. Much better than some of their other games.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just because it's the last one of the trilogy! I started reading it all over as soon as I finished it!<br />Ana and Christian are married and a series of dramatic events starts happening to them. They also have ups and downs in their relationship because of Christian's trust issues and both their inexperience.<br /><br />Really good and a lovely ending! :)
B009E2WX3W|5.0|Absolutely, sonically amazing. PG is a master craftsman. He has always pursued the finest sonic nuances in his work. The unbelievable detail is even more clear now, with the remaster. Some catchy tunes too!
B00A0HQ9GM|4.0|It's hard to describe Del Rey's music. It's a fairy-dusting of harp laid over top a hip-hop cadence. It's lush instrumentals alongside precise vocal transitions from low and jazzy up to high and girlish. Del Rey has called her own music \\"Hawaiian glam metal.\\" Others have called it \\"Hollywood sadcore.\\"<br /><br />Others have described it in less complimentary ways. One reviewer called it a thin bundle of Lolita imprecations and sun-baked poolside sexuality. Another called it the epitome of a faked orgasm.<br /><br />Del Rey's music neither soothes nor satiates, but it captivates. One reviewer nailed it: \\"These are the disturbing movies that you watch because of the intensity behind the storytelling.\\"<br /><br />That's why I think the most accurate description of this music is \\"Lynchian,\\" as in the filmmaker David Lynch. On the second disc she performs a deadened rendition of a song from his movie Blue Velvet. In the hands of Del Rey, it's even more Lynchian: twisted and disturbing, the drugged sexuality of a mannequin come halfway to life.<br /><br />Del Rey, like Lynch, is \\"the perfect mirror of our time\\" and \\"the artist we deserved.\\" She neither soothes nor satiates, but she certainly warrants our attention.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Technical note: This album has such poor reviews not because of the music but because of missing tracks. There are 3 missing tracks on the first disc if you buy the CD version. This is not a problem if you buy the mp3s. For those who already bought the CD, it sounds like Interscope is working to fix things, but not sure how/when they will do it.
B004JY0KP8|4.0|I have been using this watch for some time. I am certainly not a heavy user with the usual suspect that cell phones are replacing the watch market. The watch itself is great, not too heavy and is rugged. with the battery comes in for over a year. I replaced the strap as it starts to wear especially where it is buckled. Otherwise Seiko brand is well respected and I am yet to be disappointed with quality of the watch itself.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|This is not your typical Stephen King Horror... It is simply the most enthralling love story I have read to date.
B00A11AN6O|3.0|I have a kindle(first generation) and i dont upload photos to my tablet because of the shortage of memory for that kind of work.But this app allows you to do that.Its following Amazon's 5 GB of music.I would think this would be ideal for photos savers alike.But not for me.

B008GXHOFW|3.0|I really enjoy playing this game, but it constantly freezes and restarts progress in the missions. Other than that, it's a really good game.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I grew up with Sean Connery as \\"Bond...James Bond...\\" and he will always be Bond to me more than any other actor.  However, Daniel Craig is rapidly growing on me as my second favorite Bond of all time.  I enjoyed the first two Craig movies, but this one was brilliant!  It went deeper into the character than in a long time, and revealed bits of his past that were not only believable, but shed light on many aspects of his internal character.<br /><br />The opening action scene speeds by and is rough and tumble fighting and chasing as good as any previously done.  But it ends with Bond DEAD (or so everyone thinks) and MI6 under an all too personal attack.  Bond returns from his \\"vacation\\" of drinking and womanizing (as if he would be up to anything else!) out of shape, shaken, not too sure of himself, and tying to hide the fact that he is definitely not ready to go back to duty.  From that point...what we see is an exercise in trust and loyalty as we can't help but compare Bond with the bad guy rogue agent.  What makes one man break and one man continue on against all odds?  What makes one man strong and another man go mad?  Silva and Bond are two sides of the same coin--smart, savvy, killers who ended up on very different paths.<br /><br />What really makes Bond tick deep down inside?  Where does his deep sense of loyalty of country and love-hate relationship with M come from?  It will all become clear by the ruthless and heart-wrenching final battle of the movie.<br /><br />I can't wait to see where they take this Bond next...Skyfall has deepened my love and affection for James Bond like no movie in a long time.  Best of all, what they have added to the character rings utterly true.  It's like stumbling across a gem that you never noticed before, like re-discovering what you felt when you first read one of Ian Fleming's books.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  I'll be snapping this up when it comes out!
B007O4XX9K|4.0|we were very pleased with this CD. Joe Walsh has written some very moving lyrics regarding sobriety. I recommend this CD.
B008HK3S9K|3.0|This Timbuk2 envelope sleeve fits the Kindle Fire HD perfectly. Is is very nice, however, to me it seems to not have enough padding to adequately protect your Kindle Fire. I really like the velco flap that makes sure the Fire won't fall out. The inside is somewhat soft, but a little rougher than I'd like. I would recommend a screen protector while using this sleeve. The sleeve does the job, but if your looking for more padding and something a little softer, you might want to try something different.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|The movie itself is great. I got it when it was on sale for only twenty dollars and I feel like I got my money's worth. I would not pay over 25 dollars for this set though. It says 4 disc but in reality it's only more like 2. You get the dvd and blu-ray which is fine. They other two disc are Blu-ray 3D and the digital copy. If feel like they only added them to make it sound like your getting more, they should have just put the digital copy on a code and left out the 3D blu-ray all together (who even has a 3d blu-ray player?). That it's it's a little lacking in special features, you'd think the top of the line set would have hours of features but it's really only a blooper reel, some commentary, and like 30 minutes of interviews normally I'd be fine with that but like I said, for the top of the line box set it's a little weak.<br /><br />That's two negatives so I feel like I should take 2 stars off. If I was rating the movie itself it would be 5 stars but this box set is only 3.
B00112GVFO|3.0|The storyline is completely ridiculous for most of the movie.  But it's still a lot of fun to watch.  Just a regular fun adventure film.  Awesome soundtrack though!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|love this game i can play it for hours and hours love the shake bar the most awesome needs more coins lol
B00992CF6W|3.0|this game is really awesome on PS3 and XBOX and PC but this is so much on kindle even survival craft is better except its only 15 freaking minutes.

B008NW67E0|5.0|After a year of touring non-stop, people were afraid Mumford & Sons wouldn't be able to pull together another amazing album.<br /><br />I am happy to report that this is not the case in any way. Babel's climbing crescendos and twangy banjo show that Mumford & Sons are the same great band. They've lost none of the energy that made them great upon the first hearing. Marcus Mumford belts out the lyrics with the same meaningful force.<br /><br />If you're looking for more of the Mumford & Sons signature style, look no further. This is the album we've all been waiting for.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I'm not a trekky but I liked this movie.  If you're a fan of sci-fi and know a little about star trek I think you'll enjoy this.  If you're a hard core William Schatner trek fan then you should probably skip this.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Love Doris's writing style. I had a difficult time putting the book down! I wish my history teachers & books would have had this much enthusiasm in school....I totally &#34;get&#34; why people are historians! So interesting!
B004JRVQX0|1.0|Software company says:<br />  \\"Hi you're an honest customer, and have just bought our product. We are nieve enough to think that forcing you to shell out another $50 for copyright protection you shouldn't need (because you already paid for the item), is going to stop others from breaking the encryption.\\"<br /><br />This is a scam, I purchased the required Ilok just over one year ago, and already it is on the fritz. What this means, is that I will have to PAY to send it to the ilok company so they can send me back another one. So, basically, I am paying for something I already purchased(the software), plus paying for the ILOK, plus paying to ship it back.<br /><br />Worst of all, anything you have used the ILOK for, is now unusable until you get the new one back.<br /><br />Oh, did I mention, If your Ilok is out of warranty, then you will have to PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE.<br />My advice is don't use products that require an ILOK.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really like this game. Although I think that it's a little easy. luckily it has more packages that you can download.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was not sure about reading the book and a coworker brought it to me and said give it a try! So glad I did! Loved the trilogy. Would love to read more!!  My daughters have all read them now too!!!
B001NLKZZ0|1.0|Much ado about nothing.  Repetitive, self-serving, and generally not helpful.  Golf is trial and error, there are fundamental technical skills that must be developed, and the feel-good approach does little for improvement.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The only weak part of this set is the Fourth Book, A Feast for Crows, which is not nearly as good as the first three.  Having said that, it is still a good book to a otherwise AMAZING WORK OF FANTASY!  I may even prefer it to Lord of the Rings! George RR Martin is a genius!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer was one Grisham's better novels.  I like John Grisham well enough that I buy his books regardless of their marketing introductions.  The character development, storyline and pace kept my attention.  I did not see the ending coming although there were clues, which was a pleasant surprise.  Overall, this was a most entertaining and enjoyable book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Just wonderful. Outstanding writer as always. Can't wait for the next one. Enjoy reading all of his books. Talented Man.
B008220C92|5.0|Scott Derrickson's \\"Sinister\\" is one of the most skilled and seasoned additions to the horror genre I have ever seen.  And this is after about 15 years of seeing the best material available.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, a fairly despicable writer of true crime.  His character is a believable mix of unchecked ambition, careerism, and just a hint of a man who was once principled and wanted to give the victims he so eagerly profits off justice through the written word.  With his wife Tracy (played with a bit too much distance by Juliet Rylance) and his two children, he deliberately moves into the home where a murder he investigated took place.  The town sherrif (played well by Fred Thompson--he found his way to the set!) wants no part of him, understandably, and warns him to move before something even worse takes place.  This all sounds like cliche horror fare, but the way Derrickson films it is entirely new.  He departs from the \\"puppet master\\" style of [[ASIN:B0055D3EFU Insidious]] and only uses the \\"found footage\\" of the previous family's disaster to highlight the real premise of this supernatural thriller: that a certain kind of voyeurism--incidentally, what anyone who watches this must be complicit in--is itself a trait bad enough to warrant the punishment that comes, and boy, does it.  He deceptively puts the viewer at ease halfway through the film--I mistakenly thought the real promise of the film had already passed halfway through the movie--and then delivers what can only be called some masterfully cruel and unusual punishment.  The end, without using any spoilers, makes me think of a grimier [[ASIN:B001QI0FAA Carnival of Souls]].<br /><br />I'm not sure I could watch this again, and is only for those who like the absolute hell creeped out of them.  I think the success of the film is also dependent on it's soundtrack.  To my mind, this is better than [[ASIN:B003204MQS Paranormal Activity]] and the aforementioned film he did with James Wan.  A masterpiece.asterpiece.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Ihave been a Grisham fan for decades but I thought this latest was not up to his standards.  It seemed to be a \\"fill in the blank\\" effort and lacked much of the sharpeness and drama of earlier efforts.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is an excellent show. I didn't get into it during the 1st season. A few months ago I was visiting my daughter and she was watching 2nd season on DVD. I really enjoyed the parts I saw so I bought it when I got home!
B007JRU4N0|4.0|This well acted movie set in beautiful settings in Hawaii is a drama that stays with you long after you have watched it. Must admit that there have been better movies in this genre, but nevertheless it is aboslutely worth watching.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Wow, I didn't see that coming at all.  I have no clue who that guy is but I just can't wait for the second book.<br /><br />I have been reading fantasy novels for years and read all the big series (Sword of Truth, Wheel of time, etc.) and I can honestly say that I haven't enjoyed a book like this for a while.  The pace might be slow at first in the beginning, but the plots, caracters and such just make it all a great novel.  I will and would recommend this book to any fantasy fan without any doubts that they will enjoy it.  Great read and I'll buy the other books from this series.
B006QKJQ12|3.0|Watched this as I thorouhly enjoyed Kung Fu Panda 1. The second movie is not as good and could not keep my attention.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I have been looking for package deals all the time and I did not Hesitate on this great deal, thanks.
B002O2THRO|4.0|I watched this movie due to my recent visit to Newport where I visited the Great Gatsby mansion. The movie has not dated and with the excellent acting and directing well worth watching the two and a half hours.
B001D8W7CW|5.0|All package intact<br />Very well presentation<br />Video quality is good fits screen<br />Audio quality is good<br />Includes trailer<br />Scene selection
B0027BVMSY|3.0|A Bond movie every few years is always a fresh addition to the silver screen. Quantum is gripping, well acted and worth watching even though it is not one of the best Bond movies.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This movie is very good with the awesome Blu-day HD quality it has. You can see every detail and the whole movie is very long and amazing. If you have the money and a Blu-ray player, BUY IT! If not........ then buy it for someone else!
B00493ADJ2|4.0|With superb acting by Annette Bening, Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo this is a very memorable movie. The storyline is not predictable at all and keeps you guessing until the very end. It won various awards and rightly so.
0385535147|4.0|John Grisham's last book - The Litigators - was one of my favourites by this award winning author. (my review) I was pretty excited to read his latest - The Racketeer.<br /><br />Racketeer: \\"A person who commits crimes such as extortion, loansharking, bribery, and obstruction of justice in furtherance of illegal business activities.\\"<br /><br />Malcolm Bannister is a former attorney, currently serving time in the Frostburg, Maryland prison camp for money laundering. Trouble is, he swears he's innocent - he just picked the wrong client. License gone, wife gone, everything he had - gone. Five years into his sentence, he may have found a way out. He knows who killed Federal Judge Raymond Fawcett, found dead in his cabin retreat beside an empty safe. Can he bargain the killer's name for his freedom? And what about what was taken from the safe? There's a lot of people after that knowledge...<br /><br />I love 'heist' and 'sting' type movies such as Ocean's Eleven. Grisham weaves his own take on the heist scenario with The Racketeer. And it's a great piece of storytelling. This is still a 'legal' thriller to a degree, but I think Grisham just had a lot of fun with this one. It's not a serious book, but an entertaining tale.<br /><br />As he says in the author notes at the end: \\" The Racketeer is indeed a work of fiction. Accuracy was not deemed crucial. Long paragraphs of fiction were used to avoid looking up facts.\\"<br /><br />I chose to listen to this book. J.D. Jackson was the reader and his voice was perfectly suited to the main character. Macolm changes his speech patterns at one point and I did find the slower pace a bit annoying. I just wanted the story to move along.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this a four instead of a five is that there was just something about Malcolm I didn't like. He's the one we should be rooting for, but I found him to be pompous and cocky. I never did feel sorry for him. Did he get what he deserved? In his eyes, yes. In mine - not really. I almost felt sorry for the 'bad guy'. I don't know that it was Malcolm's place to mete out judgment. In the end he's no better and his protestations of innocence at the beginning of the book are moot.<br /><br />Still, I quite enjoyed it. Not his best, but entertaining nonetheless.really.

B007MJT1K2|3.0|Tintin is fun to watch and I guess that is what it is all about. Must admit that I expected more from this movie, but cannot pinpoint what went wrong.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Basically everything in one. I can't ask for more when it comes to recording external audio. The 2 XRL inputs are such a bonus.
B004BSFC46|5.0|My baby loved these rattles the moment we showed these to her. She just smiled and smiled at them. I bought two sets of these so we could dangle them from her carseat when traveling, since they are soft. She has now outgrown these and moved on to bigger and better things. However, I have fond memories of how much she enjoyed these rattles. We dangled these from her bouncy chair, and had more of a success with her enjoying these there, then placing them on her wrists. They were never a big hit on her wrists.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|We pre-ordered this and it got to our house the day it was released. I thought the price was pretty good at 29.99 and then amazon sent an email stating they had found it cheaper and I was getting a refund. Packaging was awesome and the movie was everything I had hoped for and more. This one convinced me to buy all my movies from Amazon from now on.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 year old grandson loves this puzzle.He can do it all by himself. I was amazed at how fast he matched the things.  He had a little more trouble with the puzzle, but once he got the idea he was off and running.  He loves that he can do it all by himself.
B000JIHP88|4.0|My son has always gone right to sleep being memorized by this cute mobile! I love the little nightlight and he loves the rotating animals. I really like that I can have the bug noises on because he has another toy that plays music so they go nicely together. The remote doesn't work all that well but I haven't really needed it but a couple of times. I would definitely recommend! :)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a fabulous first book that is evlolving into an epic story of honor, deceit, loyalty that illustrates how intertwined people's lives can be. A very, very good read.
B000JIJPZY|3.0|As a little guy my son really liked being able to kick his feet and here the little rattle and as he got older enjoyed batting at the toys. But, once he could roll over he got irritated by not being able to roll over the hard sides and the toys above him only kept him entertained for a short while. I would definitely recommend getting the bigger version of this mat as I feel I should have. Babies would get more more use out of it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|As I said on my previous review of the Crossfire series, I absolutely loved it. It is believable and takes you away to another world.
B008A1B5Z0|4.0|This app is a truly helpful piece of software.  Any time you open an app, the operating system opens various programs needed to support that app.  When you close that app, the system is supposed to close the support programs, and clear the ram they were using.  Sometimes this does not happen, and you have a lot of \\"clutter\\" in the ram, which considerably slows the tablet's operating speed.  I run the Smart RAM Booster Pro after closing an app, and opening a new one.  It automatically (and quickly) closes out unneeded programs, and gives you a report of how much ram it freed up.<br /><br />Very useful, and I do recommend it.<br /><br />Chuck
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the first 2 books of The Crossfire series by Sylvia Day.  I could not put these books down.  I am looking forward to the third in the series. I actually have it on order already.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Having characters to follow in story makes the reading of history much more pleasurable.  I enjoyed the fact that the background information was well-researched and represented what I knew about that era.  So much better than our \\"prettied-up\\" history books.

B0059XTV4Y|5.0|After Madonna's Sticky & Sweet Tour, this film was her next project.  This film established her as a full-fledged filmmaker which she co-wrote and directed with a firm hand.  Although this film had received some good reviews, mainly on the 2 lead actors, it was generally and unjustly neglected.  The relationship between Wally Simpson and King Edward continues to draw interests to this day.  Primarily what made E. to give up his throne for W.?This probably is the best film to date on the subject.  It is a sad story about a divorced American socialite swept<br />the king off his feet with her glamorous life style that he gave up his throne and duty to his country and ended leading a lonely life for both till the end.  The only weakness of this film is the part not too well written with Abbie Cornish as the young woman who's facsinated by W/E.  A touching film with 2 excellent performances by the actors who played W(Andrea Riseborough's star's rising) & E with impressive production design and finely written script.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|I found the first book very entertaining but this reads like the author knew she had a moneymaker on her hands and just wrote something to get it out there.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Although it would be impossible for a man to endure what Liam Neeson's character goes through in this movie, it's fun to let yourself fall into fantasy land and imagine it really happening. It's full of adventure and unexpected occurrences. I highly recommend this movie for those that are adrenalin junkies.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book lacks a strong story line, too much time is devoted to discussion of the US penal code and the overall prison system. I was disappointed when I failed to connect with the main character. Interesting information but not much excitement.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Really enjoy this tv series and now I can go back and re-view previous shows whenever I want. I was happy with how quickly this came in the mail too.
0385535147|4.0|This is the kind of book you read if you want to sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />While 'The Racketeer' is a fast read make yourself slow down, especially near the end. There are many pieces to this puzzle and you'll miss it if you read at the speed in which John writes.Don't think you can zone out and still appreciate it.<br /><br />This is the best book I've read since Deborah Hersh is a Liar, which is another extremely fun read that also asks for a little bit of thought on the part of the reader.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Lee Child’s physical descriptions of town layouts,  bad guys’ hideouts, routes traveled were drawn out, clumsy, and unnecessary. Caused the story to get bogged down. Seemed like this story wanted to reveal more of the cerebral part of Jack Reacher. If this was my first read of Lee Child I wouldn’t be inclined to read his next.
B001NI5CCY|5.0|Can't believe that this is required reading for the  10th grade but my son loves this movie. So glad we found it at Amazon.com.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Saw the movie last month having seen various You Tube clips, including full length versions of the show.  Even from the clips you could see the power of this performance.  So much tighter and heavier than TSRTS.  It even surpasses the DVD pieces from Knebworth for intensity.  Granted, how can you really show intensity when there were 200, 000+ in attendance.  Amazing how after nearly 30 years these 3 musicians can still bring the thunder and the musical chops.  Jason certainly does his dad proud here, almost as heavy a drummer as his dad.  Jimmy Page has not lost a thing after all these years.  Robert Plant shows much more range and presence than the follow up tour he did with Alison Krauss.  Truly wish they could have taken the show on the road, but that would have diminished the historical significance and poignance of this performance.  There is not a slow spot in the show and the set list covers there entire catalogue except for ITTOD and Coda.  About the only standards left out are Heartbreaker and Over the Hills and Far Away.  But those pieces are on other live recordings.<br /><br />This performance has re-asserted Zeppelin as my all time favorite band.  This is a must have for any Zeppelin fans and really any fan of real music played by all time great musicians.[[ASIN:B009E3EY38 Celebration Day (Deluxe Edition 2CD, 1 Blu-Ray, 1 DVD (CD sized digipak)]]

B009A9EQL6|3.0|The album is average for Aerosmith since Permanent Vacation to date.  However, the 4 songs performed live on the DVD are a real joy to watch and HEAR.  The song Rats In The Cellar surpasses any version of the song ever (in the past).  Get it for Rats In The Cellar.  You won't be sorry.
B008ZTVQLA|5.0|I've been a fan since the early days of Mott and I think this ranks right up there with his first solo alblum and You're never alone. This alblum rocks harder than the last two (Shrunken Heads and Man Overboard- both of which I also highly recomend) but still retains the intelligent lyrics you expect from Ian Hunter. Andy York is great on guitar and as Ians new music partner He picks right up where Mick Ralphs and the late Mick Ronson left off. Another reviewer said Ian rocks harder at 73 than the 20 somethings popular today. I agree. I hope he keeps rocking forever.

0060555661|4.0|After reading the intelligent investor, I can now say that I understand what it takes to truly understand the securities that I purchase for my portfolio. The book does a fantastic job of opening a basic investor's eyes to the fact that the focus of investing is to stay with the market, not to greatly outperform it.<br /><br />The Intelligent Investor is a very in depth and dense book that looks at many different aspects of investing. I would not suggest this book for a relatively new investor who does not have much knowledge on the terminology of investing. However for someone that has had severe losses or struggles with diversifying their portfolio, I feel that this book is a fantastic fit.<br /><br />The book starts off by discussing what exactly an \\"intelligent investor\\" is and the difference between a defensive/conservative investor and one that has sufficient amounts of time to spend towards investing. It continues by laying the groundwork for what an investor should be looking for as well as what they should be looking to avoid. The book also paints a phenomenal picture of the market as a whole with sufficient information on its history and what can be learned from its history. The book continues on by laying out exactly what types of securities different investors should be looking for and how their portfolio should be split amongst these securities. Graham also focuses a fair amount of time on informing the reader of what type of investments they should be avoiding and why. He mentions that the aggressive investor should \\"avoid inferior types of bonds and preferred stocks unless they can be bought at bargain levels\\" and should \\"leave high-grade preferred stocks to corporate buyers\\". Graham also allocates some time to discussing the resources that are available to investors including investment advisers. He does not say that he is completely against the idea of an adviser but that it is crucial to find an adviser that is a good fit for an investor and maintains the same ideals of investing as him. The book then goes into specific examples of security analysis which truly help lay out the ideas that Graham is trying to push. There are many examples including a top down analysis of four different stocks as well as a comparison on different pairs of stocks and which ones would fit the ideas of the intelligent investor. The book then concludes with the fact that time needs to be spent not just on researching the stock, but also as a shareholder of the company. One must be confident in the management team that has control of their money. The last part of the book concludes with the fact that an intelligent investor is not really looking to make it big, but is looking to be comfortable with their portfolio. Hence Graham really pushes the fact that investors can not just follow the masses, but instead must take a step back and look at the market as a whole to understand exactly where it may be going next.<br /><br />The style of the book is very unconventional from many books that I have read. It provides commentary from Jason Zweig who essentially interprets the teaching of Graham into today's world. There are also many footnotes throughout the book which tend to get the reader a little off track simply by the fact that the footnotes tend to be full of information as well. Hence a reader may feel that they are jumping from idea to idea while reading the book. For me, the most helpful way to read the book is summarizing what was just read in a chapter and documenting this knowledge somewhere. Otherwise the reader may get lost in the transitions from chapter to chapter and what exactly is trying to be taught next.  However, in my opinion the structure of the book and the commentary provided does truly help portray the ideals of Benjamin Graham and brings them up to date with current examples.<br /><br />For me, the most useful parts of the book were the first five chapters and the last six chapters. The first part of the bookreally laid out a solid definition of exactly what the book was trying to teach and what type of investing strategy it would be focusing on. If one is looking to have high risk in their portfolio and large amounts of volatility, then this book is definitely not for you. However, being at a young age, the book has given me the confidence to go into the market and become an investor in my future because of the fact that there is much time that lies ahead of me. Graham says that \\"the rate of return sought should be dependent, rather, on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is willing able to bring to bear on his task.\\" The end of the book is where the entire real world examples actually come into play and show exactly what type of analysis needs to be performed on stocks. By having both examples from the time of Graham as well as more current examples from the commentary, one is able to get a full scope of the strategy that Graham is preaching. However it is clear that in order to truly become a master of intelligent investing, one needs to dedicate a lot of time and practice.<br /><br />Overall, the book truly paints a very broad picture with regards to investing. It does not state that one should allocate a specific percentage of their money to stocks, mutual funds, bonds, etc. Rather it teaches the reader how they should go about looking for securities to invest in. The book also shows the benefits of getting a dividend, how to access and read earnings reports, what to look for in these reports, and how to perform a side by side comparison of different investment opportunities. As mentioned throughout this review, the book does not tell you what to do but rather shows you should you should be doing. Do not expect to get a clear cut answer of what to be investing in after reading this book. Instead, one should expect to know how to efficiently utilize their time to analyze different stocks and prepare for what the market may do to their portfolio.<br /><br />As a reader of this book, I feel that the most beneficial next step that can be taken is looking into classes offered by brokerage firms that teach them how to utilize the tools they offer. I would suggest avoiding classes that teach you to invest, and rather focus more on classes that teach you how to utilize the tools provided. Overall, I have truly enjoyed this book and feel that I will definitely read it again because there is still much that this book has to offer.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This show is not for everyone. It is shocking, uncomfortable and moves a mile-a-minute. However, if you are up for the ride, there is nothing like it on TV. For all the camp, there is some phenomenal acting going on here which makes you have an emotional investment in the characters.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Looking at my reading log I see that I read this book at about twice my normal pace, which I guess says about as much as I need to say.  I enjoyed the Wool books very much, found it to be a real \\"screen turner\\" [read the ebook], and definitely intend to continue with the series.  The first book of the Omnibus was surprisingly short, leaving you wanting more.  In book two there is a rather dramatic change of story-line [intentionally vague to avoid spoilers] and I was briefly let down, but as the new plot-line took over I found it to be equally interesting.  The end of book 5 felt a little rushed, but overall it's a winner.<br /><br />I rated the book at 4 stars because I prefer my science fiction to have a bit more philosophical depth, causing one to ponder questions of morality, which Wool had the potential to do, but seems to have left that one for others.<br /><br />------------------------<br /> POTENTIAL SPOILERS<br />------------------------<br />While these things were touched on to some degree, I believe that there was a lot of potential to explore in greater depth the role of religion in the maintenance of the society, the morality of capital punishment, abuse of power, shared responsibilities in a communal environment, etc.  For example, priests are mentioned a few times, offering an alternate history of silo life, but the subject is quickly dropped.  Maybe there's room for another book?  Maybe it's covered more in the prequels?  I guess I'll find out shortly.  A lot of people don't like books that preach or moralize, but this can be done while leaving the final conclusion open ended, which some great authors have done.<br />------------------------<br /><br />I believe that Hugh Howey has the potential to be remembered as one of the SF giants with his world and character building talents.  The sometimes rabid following of his work shows that he's off to a great start!

B005LAIHYU|2.0|If you have read the book, you will be very disappointed.  The only thing in common is the title, which is odd because the author of the book wrote the screenplay.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Since I missed out on the earlier versions of this sonic, I started my collection with this one. I've had it for a couple of months now, and have been very happy with it! It helped me find and fix an annoying A/C leak in my daily driver (Ha! Money well spent right there!). The slider button cover and screw tend to loosen up with use, but a small dab of Blu-Tack adhesive putty applied to the back of the cover has fixed both problems. It's much more sonic now!

B006BXTOFC|5.0|You will not regret this purchase!  This band is great and you should check out their other albums as well!
B009A882D0|4.0|As a band whose albums, singles and live performances were equally exciting, it can be argued that Creedence Clearwater Revival remains the greatest group in American rock `n' roll history. Whether stretching out a psychedelic jam of \\"Suzie Q\\" or \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine,\\" or packing everything they had into the 2:21 of \\"Bad Moon Rising,\\" their synthesis of rock, country, blues, and southern soul was riveting. Their hit singles still leave listeners reaching to turn up the volume, and their albums harbor dozens of lesser-known, but no less terrific covers and Fogerty originals. In a six-album stretch from 1968's eponymous [[ASIN:B001AKTZP0 Creedence Clearwater Revival]] through 1970's [[ASIN:B001AKTZOG Pendulum]], the quartet never faltered - dropping dozens of hit singles and revitalizing well-selected covers with iconic guitar riffs and vocal turns that hook your ear as readily today as they did forty years ago.<br /><br />The CCR catalog has seen its fair share of reissues, with a [[ASIN:B00005OM4K box set]] in 2001, individual album remasters in 2008, and in 2009 a mono [[ASIN:B002W0GN20 singles collection]], vintage [[ASIN:B000000XBX live concert]] and a [[ASIN:B001YXXS8S covers collection]]. And then there are numerous tributes and an endless array of karaoke discs. Fantasy's latest reiteration of the core catalog is a three-disc set that goes beyond the hit singles, but not as far as the box set. It's a better introduction than a single disc, and with the inclusion of album and live tracks, a broader look than the two volume Chronicle set. The set is delivered in a tri-fold cardboard sleeve with extensive liner notes by Bay Area music historian, Alec Palao. Among his insights is the astonishing fact that CCR never scored a chart-topping U.S. single; [[ASIN:B001AKTZPA Green River]] and [[ASIN:B0045FTQJW Cosmo's Factory]] each topped the album chart, but their peak singles, \\"Proud Mary,\\" \\"Green River\\" and \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\" topped out at #2.<br /><br />Perhaps it's fitting that the longevity of the group's legacy is broader than hit singles. The set's first two discs sample from the group's seven original studio albums, including four Fogerty-piloted tracks from the swansong, [[ASIN:B000000XCM Mardi Gras]]. Disc three collects live performances from 1970-71, recorded in the Bay Area and across Europe; all were previously issued on either [[ASIN:B000000XBX The Concert]] or as bonus tracks to the 2008 album reissues. The live mixes are necessarily rawer than the studio recordings, but they're full and punchy, show off the band's tight ensemble playing and demonstrate how well CCR's material translated to the stage. This is a great set for listeners who haven't upgraded their Chronicle LPs to CDs, those not ready for the box or album reissues, or younger listeners that need to have the waxy buildup of contemporary pop removed from their ears.

B0055MI8K2|5.0|Not a hippie hence new to Teva sandles.<br /><br />I bought a pair of these at the local REI store in the spring. Since then have hiked mountain trails & local greenways for hundreds of miles. My feet have rarely been so comfortable on these outings. I feared the 1st pair might wear out & Teva would discontinue this pattern so I bought another pair to keep in reserve. 7 months later and 500 miles down the road the first pair is barely broken in! The reserve pair may have to wait a bit.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|Upon ordering the Fiio E7 I had no idea what to expect. The first thing I did was plug my headphones into my phone and play a song. Then plug in the E7 using a line out dock [[ASIN:B004QVNNI0 FiiO L9 L-Shaped Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone]] (Get This for full experience!!) and the differrrence is huge.<br /><br />The sound was greatly enhanced with more powerful lows and mids and clearer highs. The bass is more controlled with an option to Increase bass called \\"bass boost\\" and it works well without adding any distortion.<br /><br />It is built strong with alluminum plating on the back and metal parts with a professional look to it.<br /><br />I have not used this with high fidelity headphones but Im sure it can power headphones that dont draw tons of power.<br /><br />It is also a DAC for your computer. It is used as an external sound card. It sounds good and you will not hear any static feadback you can hear in directly plugging your headphones in especially with a cheap sound card.<br /><br />At this price it is well worth it if you feel you can get more out of quality headphones. Dont bother using cheap headphones like apple earbuds or cheaply made in ear/on ear headphones.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great bible.  Only problem I find is you need to connect to WII FI so you can't use it everywhere unless you phone or tablet has 4G.  Very easy use.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I am of mixed opinion on this movie, and so were my kids (ages 8 and 6.) I love that it features a girl heroine, and I love the moody, beautiful Scottish setting and corresponding animation (5 stars for that.) But I was disappointed in the story, and felt some of the magic fell flat (3 stars on that, for a 4 overall.) The accents were also a bit difficult for my kids to follow at times, and there wasn't the warmth and humor in this that the best Pixar films have. There were flashes of it, but it wasn't consistent. I also found myself doing  a lot of explaining, partly because of the accent issues, and partly because some of the plot lines were a little over my kids' heads. I have read that this movie changed hands internally at Pixar several times, and it feels that way - a little disjointed and unsure of its identity. It doesn't have that 'vision' quality that their best films do. But it is gorgeous, and Merida is a lovely and fun character.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was great, it kept you thinking and the story went in several directions.  I could have kept reading
B008Y1YJZY|4.0|My kids really loved this movie, but I was not quite as captivated. On paper it sounds great - the two sons of Santa have two very different strengths and ideas about Christmas - Steve is the strategist, and has implemented all sorts of high-tech methods for Santa, while Arthur is all about the magic and spirit. When it's discovered early Xmas morning that one child has been missed, Arthur attempts to make good the old-fashioned way, leading to many (mis)adventures. The two brothers have to come together to sort it out, and both learn heartwarming lessons.<br /><br />Sounds great, right? Well it is, to a point, and as I said,  my kids really loved it. I found parts rather boring, and the action sequences a little too video-game like. Most of the characters didn't have the charm that they do in the best animated films, and the animation itself didn't seem particularly inventive to me (although perhaps in 3D this is more enjoyable.) It's certainly worth a watch and is a good holiday film, but not a new classic in my eyes.
1433503794|5.0|I was impressed with the accuracy (looked up Greek orgins) of this version! Simple to read, but not dumbed down. Study notes are extremely insightful.
B009AMALLM|4.0|Too all idiot fans doesn't have to be scary to be good. Anyways loved the movie and find out a lil more about Kate , I still don't completely know what happend after the third cause after the third what happends to the child. I hope the next one gives me more info on the past to fill in the missing gaps
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I must admit, I only bought this as a Christmas gift for someone.  I myself, after seeing the trailer for this movie, will never watch it!  I was shocked at the way Johnny Depp treated this movie after he professed to have been a fan of the original.  To turn it into a spoof was nothing short of insulting.  I will continue to watch my DVD's of the original and the primetime series and leave this one alone.
B009B4ZEMA|5.0|I love this album I think it's awesome. I listen to it all the time my favs are Army Of Me Make The World Move and Just A Fool but all the songs are really good this really is a great album you should totally bye it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very addictive! So many great ideas to try using everyday items! Makeup and hair tricks. make trying new methods super easy!
0547884591|5.0|The 4-Hour Chef is the latest and greatest from Tim Ferriss. As an avid reader of his previous two books, I have to admit that I approached the new book with a cautious optimism. Having now read it, I can officially remove that \\"cautious\\" label: not only is the book a fascinating take on the intersection of two worlds (learning and cooking), but it is also gorgeously designed cover-to-cover and chalk full of practical lessons for even the most stubbornly-awful chefs-in-the-making.<br /><br />The book opens with a discussion on meta-learning, or learning how to learn. In this, Tim discusses methods from the world's top learners, and outlines his method for absorbing information rapidly. It then flows into \\"The Domestic,\\" which is the idiot's guide to cooking - the items every kitchen needs, the most efficient way to stock your pantry, and early lessons for some easy, but impressive dishes. From there, the book takes a turn for the outdoorsy with \\"Wild,\\" where Tim covers his first hunt, how to make drinkable water, and all sorts of fun Les Stroud-esque material. The following chapter, \\"The Scientist\\" includes the brainier side of cooking - from bacon infusing your bourbon to making \\"crunchy\\" bloody mary's - and the science behind each recipe. The book closes with \\"Pro\\" - an analysis of the world's top restaurants and a few easy favorites to take your cooking skills to the next level.<br /><br />Usually it takes months after reading a book for it to form any practical implementation in my life, no matter how profound the content. The 4-Hour Chef's turnaround time is sitting at just over a day. On a Thanksgiving trip home, it was time to impress the parents by showing off my newfound cooking chops. I gathered up a few ingredients, got my meez (mise-en-place) all ready, and fired up the Dutch oven. A couple hours (and a number of \\"mmm... something smells good\\"! comments) later, I happily served up a nice plate of Osso \\"Buko\\" (Tim's take on the modern classic) and coconutcauliflower curry mash - two of the first recipes in the book. It was fantastic - the best meal I've cooked in years - and made me look like a cooking virtuoso. I was welcomed with choruses of \\"wow, thanks so much for dinner!\\" from the parents. I shrugged my shoulders and received the compliments with open arms. In reality, I have just one person to thank: Tim.
0345803507|5.0|This series is all the rave....I like how they put all 3 books together for sale. I would rather buy books this way so you dont have to go hunt down the next book.
B001F4UHFI|4.0|This movie becomes more relevant with each passing year.  Its one of Cage's best performances and a great movie that didn't get the attention it deserved at the box office.

B005LAIH9K|5.0|I loved the first 3 movies (we'll ignore the straight to DVD crap) for how they captured the lives of these high schoolers and now \\"10 years\\" later they are reunited again.  I thought this was a very funny movie and had some hilarious parts and clever story lines in it.  It's interesting to see where the gang all ended up over the years and see where their lives took them.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Bought 2 of these one for a friend they are a different band and they sing in german I love their music even though I don't speak the language. If you like hard rock music you will like this..
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Although this film loosely follows the book, with a few made up sub plots, it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. Francis O'Connor is completely charming as Fanny Price, even if this character barely resembles that of the Fanny Price Austen created.  Moving past that this is a truly enjoyable movie!
B00351YEVC|5.0|Originally purchased this for my 10 year old and read it myself first.  A touching story well told. Suitable for all ages.  Better than the film

B006TTC5JK|5.0|This one is stunning on blu-ray....like I've never seen it before.... Definitely one of James Stewarts' best roles--if you haven't seen it , you must.... I really can't say anymore than the others have said about this film, so I will just confirm that the blu-ray is fantastic in 1080P....definitely worth the upgrade....it's pretty darn cheap too....
0800141660|5.0|Actors Emma Thompson,Kate Winslet & Hugh Grant play off each other brilliantly doing justice to this classic Jane Austin novel.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I purchased this CD specifically for the first cut, Gabriel's Oboe, from The Mission. However, this entire collection is so well-constructed that I can barely stop listening.  Ma's supreme mastery and Morricone's vibrant compositions are paired so elegantly.  The execution is exquisite, with so much emotion evident in the playing.  Classical music aficionados may balk at the fact that all the tracks here were composed by Morricone for movies; however, if you did not know that, I suspect that the most classical snob would find this music touching, emotional, and well worth spending listening time.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Gwyneth Paltrow shines as Emma in this version of the Austin classic. Beautiful scenery, great casting & fine acting will have you falling in love with this film.
B0055X5CGO|5.0|I remember having this book as a kid and I read it until it fell apart.  The art is imaginative and colorful and not scary to a small child.  It's funny and a delightful story.  I can still remember the illustrations with fondness as an adult.  A great book for any child to explore the fun side of spooky!
B000IKQMFO|5.0|Brilliant writing & acting keep the viewer guessing till the reveal. Maggie Smith has you laughing from the moment she appears onscreen.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|50 shades of ho hum.  Definately a chick book. (Would make a great pay for view movie). Lol yawn, stretch
B008KRJWEK|4.0|game is entertaining and gives me something to do in my free time. also has decent graphics for being a free game
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game.  I highly recommend it as a way to pass time and to give your brain a workout. Have at it!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|One of the best documentaries in years.  This is a must-see, from the fascinating shots of a decadent Detroit to the lush photos of Cape Town, it's a perfect film all around.  This one melds a class analysis, intriguing mystique, and phenomenal music to create an enthralling true story that's touching beyond belief.<br /><br />The stoic and beautiful daughters and the fellow blue-collar workers add some of the more fascinating insights about a man who was a wandering musical street spirit in the Motor City at the start of massive deindustrialization.  His lyrics and rhythm swept through neighborhoods filled with character, troubles, class, wisdom, taste, and addictions.<br /><br />The one depressing thing about this documentary is that it holds up in your face true talent and brilliant music at a time when the contemporary pop scene is so devoid of authenticity and Rodriguez-like subtle emotion, brilliance and genuine skill.<br /><br />The whole story arc and how everything unfolds is impossible to get over.  The daughters are remarkable with their down to earth spot-on analysis of it all.<br /><br />I know it's a cliche but 'Searching for Sugar Man' really should be viewed by everyone as soon as possible.<br /><br />It should be noted that the soundtrack is stunning as well.
B00138KE2C|4.0|...Minus the heavy guitars is still pretty awesome.  I love this acoustic set from my favorite band.  Even with acoustic guitars, Dave Grohl still rocks hard.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|As soon as I had found out that Shadow of the Colossus was done as an HD remake for PS3, I definitely had to get my hand on a copy. Though I've never actually played ICO previously, i am excited to play it now for the first time knowing that Shadow of the Colossus is considered a \\"spiritual sequel\\" to ICO.<br /><br />the graphics of the games go amazingly on a nice LCD HDTV. I've tested the 3D for Shadow of the Colossus and it was aboslutely amazing. The 3D element brings a whole new style to the game when climbing up 50 foot tall idols. For anyone who played it originally for PS2, I would highly recommend getting this update.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show is great, it is a masterpiece of soap opera. I hope it goes on for the next ten years.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Full disclosure....DeMille is one of my favorite authors. I look forward to every one of his novels and only wish he would write more. ( I realize long hand on a legal pad takes longer but it's worth it!) Once I start...not reading on is like taking a break halfway through a good movie. Enjoy the action, tongue in cheek sarcasm and just the right amount of humor!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I have installed and reinstalled this app four times because it will always come to a point somewhere after level 20 (it varied each time) when it will not allow me to buy any items from the store. Turning the Kindle on and off does not help.

B009NQKXYK|2.0|I have come to expect so much more from Ridley Scott. The story is weak, and predictable, the acting is mediocre, the dialogue is tortured. Really wish he hadn't bothered.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I have been reading the whole series and not to get into great depth but its been a good read so far I do fair bit of reading from many authors and chew few about 20-30 fiction novels a year I do get a bit weary with the exceptional depth that martin goes into all his characters actions but continue to keep reading.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book is a little different from other books written by John Grisham.  It is taking me a long time to get into the story.  So far, about 1/4 of the way in, I am not hooked.  I keep waiting as I have enjoyed his other efforts.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|I learned more about the people, events, and effects of the Civil War from Team of Rivals, than I ever did having college degrees in the history of the United States!  It is as easy to read and as beautiful as any prose, and the brilliance and passion of Abraham Lincoln leaps off of the pages.  The movie, Lincoln, is based only on a very small portion of the book, and reading the massive volume is like watching 100 movies!  To understand modern American life, and modern American politics, it is incumbent upon everyone to read Team of Rivals.  The loss of Lincoln in America's future after the Civil War, becomes astoundingly clear.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Just didnt really like the movie the concept was ok but the acting wasn't amazing and thought there would be a better twist of plot but two much of the old snow white incorporated in my opinion.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|Two parts 1st spending the money  2nd satisfaction of the product<br />The second helps to answer both.... Yes and yes<br />The seven seasons in the white house was like watching  good wine age.<br />This box set goes past the TV viewing episodes, and ventures beyond<br />Congressman Santos election win, played by Jimmy Smits.<br />154 episodes and well worth it.<br />The only negative resulting in lost of star rating , no english subtitles in half of seasons.
0547884591|5.0|If you're NOT a Michelin Star chef and are after the top 100 recipes then this book is NOT for you. You're probably better off googling the recipes.

B004TTHLBE|2.0|The story line was all over the place..maybe would come to together at the end...Just didn't have the patience to stick with..
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is amazing! It's one of the best in the series! I can not waste for \\"The House of Hades\\" to come out next year!
B009B0L324|4.0|Pretty much what you would expect for the \\"boys\\" only a little slower, a little less energy and a little less vocal range from Johnson than the last time out.  But what it all boils down to is Angus & Malcolm; and the bros still have the chops. So for me, any AC/DC album is worth the purchase for their guitar playing alone.  Still, \\"River Plate\\" is pretty much for die hard fans who have them all and want to keep them coming.  For newcomers (if there are any of those who still exist)  \\"If You Want Blood\\" & \\"AC/DC Live\\" for the Scott & Johnson era respectively are your best bang for the buck.
B000FBJF6Y|1.0|The book is too \\"wordy\\" Names and items are repeated too often. ie. \\"tiny white van\\".  The characters are not believable.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|I bought this to record my old, hard to find LPs for my iPod. The sound is not the best, but not bad either.  I get a small amount of feedback that is picked up in the recording.  I am not that picky but if you are looking for a perfectly clear sound then spend a little more money. I pretty much got what I expected for the price.<br />As for the software it is very easy to use.  Ignore the bells and whistles though.  Also it will almost always create one large MP3 file rather than a single file for each track.  This is due to the noise picked up between tracks. You will have to edit these in to individual files.<br />Overall I would say I am happy with what I received.

B009B4ZEKM|1.0|The title says it all, Garbage..<br />Christina really needs to establish who she is as an artist, She seems to just jump on any bandwagon that is on its way out, Which may explain why she hasn't had a hit or been relevant in the music industry for years....<br />Not to mention she's extremely Unlikeable.
B001NHN7TU|4.0|I watched this one when it first came out. I have always liked Fred Ward and this movie doesn't disappoint. Not super scary, a few laughs, a couple of moments that sit you up in your chair. Overall a fun movie.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is the best John Grisham book I've read yet.  I loved the ending.  Couldn't believe it!<br />I've read most all of his books
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This movie had a lot of action and amazing visual effects. It reminded me a lot of the 'matrix' in its action and unlikely hero. The way that they wove historicaly accepted facts with extreme action and rich fiction to form an entertaining and cohesive narriative was very enjoyable. I watched it 3x in the 24 hr rental.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Decent. Gives you alot to ponder. Not sure how I felt after I read it. A few slow spots and a little different experience than some of the other books about the same topic.
B0031RS2HC|3.0|A good story line and lot's a surprising twists, although expected the main charactor to be more robust action man,It's a must read before any other Jack Reacher books.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|twenty bucks seems like highway robbery for such classics.  Especially since the first 2 (both the oldest and most important of the 4)are remastered and in impeccable shape for a sound and video perspective.  Gotta love Amazon when deals like this pop up.  Shipped perfectly, packaged safely.
B007XAYKX8|4.0|It's Motogp, what's not to like.  As in the &#34;Faster&#34;, the focus is primarily on Rossi, not a bad thing, I'm a big Rossi fan, and he is arguably the biggest draw in Motogp.  So it make sense that they would focus on him, that and the fact the is will be looked on as one of the all time greats.<br />With that said, I thought Faster was better (I miss watching the riders on the 500 2-strokes and without all the electronic assistance.  Still, if you like motorcycle roadracing, this is a must watch.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|The details of this doctor's journey was very good.  I could imagine it in my mind.<br />I think it's amazing that a brain surgeon would go through this journey knowing how<br />the brain works and be able to describe it in such detail. I am a true believer in<br />Heaven and knowing that God put this vision in his mind and have him to describe it<br />in a story is Wonderful.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|Movie was classic James Bond. Looking forward to seeing the next two movies Solace and Skyfall. Daniel Kreg was great as James Bond.
B009DT98RK|5.0|This is one of the best live concerts on blu ray, both audio and video quality are excellent. The concert alone is 2 hours 46 minutes, with a lot of great guitar playing and jamming. Peter is one of the greatest guitar players-rather than an aging teenage idol. You won't regret it, if you like great guitar playing or rock and roll. At almost 62, Peter still rocks! Marvellous!<br /><br />One side note: For that 2 stars reviewer-what it does to this blu ray or dvds, or Peter Frampton, if you only received 1 disc instead of 2?
B007IXWKUK|4.0|More answers to questions from the first book.  Kept me interested.  Jumped right in to book three after I finished this one.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|While this book was absolutely a page turner , it was also one you need to keep the tissues handy.  A must read for sure!!!!

B007SGLZP8|1.0|First of, I didn't find the writing all that great or lucid . It dragged on often & some parts were murky . it's obvious the author did it for suspense but its got lost on me once I figured it out like the real identify of Vanessa & that poor country whom Malcom totally screwed . I have never hated a character to a point that I would kill them if I have a choice/chance . Malcom is a real hypocrite & a total coward & scumbag. He claims that the federal government is wasting money, time & people's lives & some incarcerated people aren't real criminals . I actually agreed with Malcom on this on many levels . Yet the same system he wishes to destroy, he turns around, steal money, get people incarcerated & spend taxpayers money in a fake witness protection, making federal judges & Fbi travel on his command with no one's money but taxpayers only to have them come up empty handed . Really , that's what he calls justice ? selfish& egotistical bastard is what I call it . if he wants genuine vendetta, I suggest the author makes him watch &#34;Prison Break&#34;. Now that's classy & meaningful justice , not this garbage of a Malcom . oh & the ending sucks big time . Please stay from this one .
B009AMANBA|4.0|I was one of the lucky ones to see a screening of Lincoln prior to it's release. This is one of those movies that is destined to becoming a classic. Daniel Day-Lewis was nothing short of amazing ,he didn't portray Lincoln ,he was Lincoln. The supporting cast turned in some outstanding performances and it was Tommy Lee Jones that led the pack.The only issue I had was, for the first 30 minutes or so of this 2 1/2 hour epic, was slow and due to the language of the day, I had a bit of trouble following what was going on. As things progressed ,I began really getting into it and by the part in the movie  where the votes on slavery began tallying, it was both stellar and stirring . Whether you are a history buff, student in school, general movie goer or new to this country , This ones for you.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Who doesn't love Thor . I love the movie and cartoon love love love action movies. That's all I'm writing

B008673ZAQ|4.0|My favorite dysfunctional couple is back. Gideon and Eva wore me out but I wouldn't expect anything less. Reflected in You starts off the day after Bared to You ended. Yes, the day after. I started reading Reflected thinking some real time had passed and I was shocked when I realized it was the day after. So you know what that means. No growth in Gideon and Eva's relationship whatsoever in the beginning of the book. I prepared myself for the emotional roller-coaster ride they were about to take me on.<br /><br />When I read Bared To You, I couldn't decide if Gideon and Eva should be together. It seemed like they brought out the worst in each other. After reading Reflected In You, I've come to the conclusion that they deserve each other. They are both crazy and to inflict that on innocent people would be cruel. Let the cray cray stay contained within their relationship. They obviously get off on it. It's the only way they know how to function as a couple. Gideon and Eva don't know how to be any other way.<br /><br />Eva was so jealous and insecure in this book but Gideon wasn't helping the issue with his evasiveness and secrets. There were times where I wanted to throttle both of them. They frustrated the poo out of me, especially Eva. She was whiny, clingy and jealous. I was hoping she would put on her big girl panties and put Gideon in his place. When she did, she would still whimper and whine. You'd think two people going to therapy would better know how to handle their issues, at least a little bit. But no. Things get too intense and instead of talking things out, they have sex. And Gideon tells Eva to trust him and she meekly agrees. It is an endless cycle.<br /><br />I don't know if Gideon and Eva's relationship has made any progress (in a positive way). They are both jealous and clingy and insecure. I think Gideon is slightly more crazy than Eva and we find out more about what happened to him as a child. How someone can go through life keeping that pain inside them without becoming a serial killer is beyond me. I think Gideon's big toe is on that line and Eva barely keeps it in check. Just when I was ready to write Gideon off as a possessive, controlling, untrustworthy son of a gun he does something that completely changes my opinion of him. They're both cray cray and need extensive therapy but somehow their craziness works for them and entertains the hell out of me.<br /><br />As much as Gideon and Eva drive me crazy and give me heart palpitations, I can't quit them. I need to see where their crazy, dysfunctional relationship is headed. It's a train wreck that I can't look away from.them without becoming a serial killer is beyond me.

1607066017|5.0|Brian K. Vaughan has begun another amazing epic.  Completely different story and setting from \\"Y: The Last Man\\", but will appeal to the same audience.  I wasn't sure about the art of Fiona Staples when I first opened the book, but after a few pages, it is clear that it fits the story perfectly and is captivating in its own right.<br /><br />I could try to summarize, but it would sound silly.  Saga has it all:  Epic wars between worlds, star-crossed lovers, bounty hunters, robots, wizards, spaceships that grow in forests, and a teen-age, incorporeal baby sitter.  The universe Vaughan is building is huge and multifaceted, and I can't wait to see what comes next.<br /><br />If you like epic adventures for the \\"adventure\\" aspect -- stories like \\"Y: The Last Man\\" and \\"The Walking Dead\\" -- then you will like this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|JOHN GRISHAM AT HIS BEST THE RACKETEER. I HAVE READ ALL OF HIS BOOKS AND THIS ONE WAS EXCEPTIONAL!<br />GREAT READING
030758836X|1.0|[[ASIN:159413605X Gone Girl]]<br />Just finished this book, in 3 days, quick for me, it is a page turner, but anything but satisfying.  The jerky, clever devices and switch ups became not only frustrating, but just aggravating.  One other reviewer said \\"fiendishly clever\\", which is one way to describe it, great detail and effort went into the plot, development of characters, [though some more fully than others, which is normal for novels, but felt inconsistent to me.]  We just discussed two things going on structurally in our book club.  One is back & forth chapters between voices.  That is so overdone and while clever, really annoying.  The second, not necessarily LIKING characters, or caring about them while being able to appreciate the work.  I didn't find anything interesting in a pathological liar that manipulates and blackmails people.  So egos are one thing, but this group was just a mess, as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Wow.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  The writing skill is there, but no reward for this reader.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure if I wanted to read this book. But everyone suggested it and now I'm hooked! I saw the movie when it first came out so I don't really remember how it differs from the book. I could not put this book<br /> down!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have finally started giving reviews so I thought I would come back to one of my all time favs, I love this book so much. I love how real and messy it can be, I know so many people want something so perfect but what makes something so amazing can be the hardships and the tough times, the horrible crap that life can throw at you, the differences you have to overcome.<br /><br />This book reminds me a little of the movie Far and Away (which was first a book) I know weird but trust me there are similarities even with a couple life times in between them.<br /><br />I love Travis and anyone saying he is controlling or abusive (puhhhlease) are just so ignorant it's not even funny. That man would die for you, would let you go and would save you!
B009186E3O|5.0|This complete and thorough box set of the 'Stones' 1965 Ireland Tour is really exciting.  The film (a little under an hour) is meticulously restored (there is an 'Extras' showing the difference by clips) and is tough to believe it is in such good shape.  The content is a real slice of time, as the Stones were playing in smaller venues with little security, traveling by train, running from crazed fans, joking with each other - it's an intimate look at a very young group.  It was shot right after, \\"(I Can t Get No) Satisfaction\\" went to #1.  The vocals, guitar riffs; everything sounds perfect just as if today.  It's amazing to remember that Mick Jagger was only 22-years old at the time.  This is the first film of the Rolling Stones on a tour and it portrays a spark of the genius yet to come.<br /><br />Included is the sturdy box set is are DVD and Blu-ray discs of the new 2012 version, the directors and producers cut, unseen footage, extras such as, interviews with each band member and two audio CD's.  One is the film soundtrack and the other is a compilation of thirteen (13) live songs made from that 1965 tour.  It is an excellent sounding live recording and placed on a period-like piece 10\\" vinyl disc (as well as on CD).  If that isn't enough, there is an original replica poster for the concert on that September 4, 1965 date.<br /><br />Also included is a slick 42 page Collector's Edition hardcover book with 14 never before seen, restored exclusive photographs.  Color photos are included as well from Marc Sharatt, the Stones tour photographer. Great reprints of vintage newspaper and magazine articles from the Irish and UK press give accounts of the dates and attendant mayhem.  Nothing is left untouched.  This is a Rolling Stones Collector's item!<br /><br />Product kindly supplied for review by 'ABKCO Films'.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|I love this album! The songs are awesome! I was not disappointed! Any three days grace lover will enjoy it.
1600597963|5.0|Other reviewers have done a more than comprehensive job of reviewing this book, so I will try to avoid duplication. I swore I wasn't going to gush, but the more I think about it, the more I feel the temptation to rave.  I will try to contain myself.  I am a fairly experienced beader and have been doing bead embroidery for several years with some success, however there were still those things I didn't know how to do, or had never really even thought about.  I do not know Jamie Cloud Eakin save through her other book, Beading With Cabochons, but I owe her a debt of gratitude.  The first 88 pages alone on techniques and stitches were worth far more than the price of the book.  I learned new ways to use uneven components, stones with holes, or donuts. I hadn't considered using a picot stitch, or moss stitch, to fill in areas and it is a wonderful idea, even if I never use it.  It's not rocket science, I'm sure, but I had just never considered the many possibilities that Eakin presents.  There is a lot about this book that pushes you to try new things, be creative, and think about your work differently, or at least it that is the effect it had on me. To be able to actually see how she had incorporated the various stitches/techniques into her work was so useful.  I usually skip the project sections in books, but I found that even here, Eakin had included more helpful suggestions.  Eakin's design sense is lovely and very different from that of a Sheri Serafini or Heidi Kumli, which is interesting in and of itself.  The wide variety of designs and the numerous photographs were excellent and inspirational, as well as practical.  This is like a Master Class for bead embroidery and will work well for beginners as well as experienced bead embroiderers. It is definitely a \\"go to\\" book and will undoubtedly become the textbook for beaders.  It makes you want to pick up your needle and get going.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great reading, loved it ... If you loved 50 shades this is right up there. Can't wait untill the third book is out..
B00009V7T2|2.0|I did like the spacey interludes between songs and the general feel of the album, however the core music did nothing for me at all.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|This is just a review of the item delivered which may be faulty as i cant open it enough to insert the battery after unscrewing the screw. There's no instructions and searched everywhere online for help on how to open it so i can know for sure if its a faulty design i got.<br /><br />So the mic can not be tested to review on that part. please help if possible so i know to return it or not.
B00000I5Y6|4.0|The sound is truly great on this cd, but the choice of songs is very odd.  It is the classics though that remind me why Kansas has a soft spot in my heart.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Nice continuation of the story. Characters cut from broad cloth to provide engaging companions through the woes of Westeross. I hope the story remains strong through the next books.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|This book is a repeat of former books.  I believe if you removed the F word, the book would be half it's size.  My friends assure me that people do talk like this in real life, but I can't imagine it.  There were story lines that were interesting.  The ending was hurried and I had to read part of the book over to place the villain.  If you like the past novels you'll like this one.
B005USZYDU|2.0|There was a beginning a middle, but no end. Nothing like his adult novels, this book was anti-climatic, unless your a child don't waist you time.
B0007PLLQ0|1.0|Amazon has combined the reviews for all three versions of this movie out. So you may not be getting what you think!! I ordered the first one that popped up and was surprised when I did not receive two different versions of the movie with different musical scores, as one reviewer mentioned. It is because that particular review was probably for Legend (Ultimate Edition), but his his review (and everyone elses) is listed under all three versions of the movie for sale. BE AWARE that the director's cut version comes with the Jerry Goldsmith music score, which is not the original score that you heard when you watched this movie as a kid. The Jerry Goldsmith score is so bad, it literally ruins the movie!! What you want is the version of the movie with the Tangerine Dream score.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't own this but I own the PC version and anything half as good as that is worth getting.

0062183591|4.0|It is no surprise that dishonesty exists in abundance.  The early economic work on dishonesty considered it a rational calculation based off cost/benefit analysis which fits nicely into pre-existing models for human behaviour for economists.  Subsequent experimental work has shown this to be inaccurate and failing in many dimensions.  Dan Ariely i a behavioural economist and uses The Honest Truth About Dishonesty as a means to discuss in various contexts how we can be dishonest, how we justify it to ourselves and how the environment impacts out decision making.  Some of it is quite intuitive, but much of the book is enlightening and provocative.  I'll give a quick overview of the contents.<br /><br />The rational crime model, as mentioned above, was the first model of crime being a result of rational computing of the cost benefit of committing the crime.  The author first discusses examples which contradict the pure conclusions of such cost benefit analysis for example using examples of cab driver fairs for the blind versus those with sight (the rational outcome would favor those with sight to get a shorter route, but it turns out the opposite is true).  Other examples like white collar crime and the magnitude of cheating in experiments where one is not observed cheating are discussed (in experiments where the monetary reward increased the magnitude of cheating remained the same in many examples showing that cheating was not based off the risk reward in any pure sense).  The author continues on with many more examples of cheating that we can rationalize and how we exaggerate the cheating of others.  Golf and the readjustment of the ball is discussed (with using a club being much more self justifiable means to move the ball than picking up and moving the ball with ones hand for a bad lie).  How the mulligan is typically used on the first hole as one can easier rationalize that the game has not started on the first hole than a subsequent.  The author goes on to discuss how our personal incentives can often cloud our professional judgement- for example the use of medical equipment post the purchase to justify the purchase rather than objectively judging each case for such medical equipment.  The author discusses how fatigue affects our honesty and how concentration and resisting temptation just sets us up to fall for it shortly thereafter by wearing us down mentally.  The author also looks at the subject of fake goods (ie designer goods).  The show how the wearing of fake goods increases the ability to be dishonest on disassociated tests, indicating breaking small ethical codes can impact aggregate behaviour by shifting ones moral compass.  The author analysis how we can convince ourselves that we are better than we are at testing when the solutions are subtely within sight.  Probably one of the more contentious parts of the book is about how creative people are better at lying.  The study was done on people with more white matter in a certain part of the brain which is the connective tissue among neurons- the argument being those who can use a wider range of reasons can more easily rationalize their behaviour and that ability to aggregate the larger range experience and knowledge is where creativity comes from.  Essentially was shown that creative people have greater ability to rationalize their bad behaviour through creative story telling and self delusion.  Definitely an interesting idea.  The author then discusses how cheating and dishonest behaviour can propogate as a function of the environment and whether the behaviour is legitimate in the eyes of the group thus discussing how much is cheating a function of social norms vs internal moral compass.  Interesting experiments show how much whether cheating is done inside or outside the group impacts its influence on the groups behaviour.  FInally the author discusses how cheating emerges in collaborative groups in which catering to peers is balanced by the individuals in the group.<br /><br />All the experiments included are good food for thought about how people can act in various situations and how they justify their behaviour.  The author is quick to point out that rationally we would all cheat and be dishonest more if it were a rational calculation so our nature is quite collaborative and based on reciprocity.  He also throughout the book shows how certain principles help keep us in line (repeating honor codes, asking ourselves whether we would be acting differently if our peers were watching etc...) and such basic guidelines will be useful in helping us keep ourselves more in line passively.  Much is intuitive in the book, but the way the information i put together makes it very enjoyable to read and informative as well, definitely recommended.oup.<br /><br />All the experiments included are good food for thought about how people can act in various situations and how they justify their behaviour.

B000IVW25M|5.0|Beautifully drawn, the voices superb, this video is definitely one of Disney's finest masterpieces.  The video was in great condition and was delivered quickly.
0345803485|1.0|ok -- maybe i expected too much of this one. but as i said, i don't like this book. And i'm certainly NOT going for book #2 :P.
0385535147|3.0|I've read everything Grisham has written, and though this is my first book review, would probably give all of them 3.5 stars with a few (better) exceptions like The Last Juror (+1 for a great lead character) or A Time to Kill (+1 for its depth of emotion). That's why I always read him, I KNOW I'm going to get 3.5 stars out of the book. I \\"trust\\" him if you know what I mean.<br />In that sense, this was typical Grisham -- so-so character development, a twist or two and a plot that is a lot of fun.<br />I have been traveling a lot lately, so I read this one on Audible (unabridged, no complaints with narrator).<br />I do recommend this one if you enjoy Grisham.<br />I had one big problem with it that knocked it down to three stars -- the way our lead character meets the woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with. Without giving away too much, is completely absurd and removed me entirely from the story. I suppose I get it from his perspective -- I mean, he's in  prison and doesn't get out much -- but her motivation baffles me. And I'm one who can easily suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. That was just a little too much and under no circumstances believable. Surly they could have come together in some other (any other) way.<br />However, what develops from their \\"relationship\\" is fun enough to redeem that weak part of the story.<br />Some reviews complained about the pacing. From an audio book perspective, I thought the pace suited the story just fine<br />I do agree the ending wasn't spectacular, but c'mon, it's Grisham. The ride is always more enjoyable than the ending.<br />All in all, worth the read.<br />Forgive my rambling review.<br />I'm no Grisham.

With their pitchforks they hunted down the monster and his creator and seek to destroy them. I never read this version of the book let alone knew if there was any other version to this novel, sadly to say. When I was recommended to read this book I thought I would know exactly how it will be but I was surprised to see it the way it was. Frankenstein thinking before I read the novel how boring it will be was actually very interesting and kept me intune. I didn't want to put it down and I wanted it never to end. Victor Frankenstein was my favorite character in the beginning of the novel. He is very intelligent and has a love for science that I can not imagine. When he created the monster I thought he wouldn't be afraid of his own creation but actually be proud of what he created. Maybe even show it to the world, but he disowned his creation and for that he went to my least favorite. As the story went on I started to see how the creation by Frankenstein was never born a monster but made into a monster by the events that he had gone through. I feel for the monster, being brought into this world when he didn't want to, having to endure the troubles of the new world by himself. He was misunderstood, like a newborn child without parents having to deal with life by himself. Still he persevered keeping his self alive. As I read I see who is the real monster, I recommend this book for those who know Frankenstein as a mad scientist who created a monster.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Decent book but the movie was better which is more times than not, not usually the case. Quick read though but not my favorite.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A well written book which keeps you guessing as one progresses through the book.  A bit different from previously read Grisham novels. It ranks right up at the top of the many books I have purchased from Amazon.
0735619670|5.0|This book covers a very wide band of the planning and construction phase of software. I'm a self taught programmer going on 5 years now doing it full time, and I have learned a lot of techniques that have filled in some holes in my skills. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their programming skill set and quality of finished code. Very well written.
B0085Z3AMW|3.0|Unfortunately, the anchor bay we knew and loved is no more.  With their apparent lack of interest in release catalog titles, I'm surprised we even saw this movie (and the part 4 blu for that matter) get released from them.  I was thrilled to get them, and believe me, the PQ is great, all things considered, but i hate that they left off extras from their previous divimax releases.<br /><br />Hopefully, one day in the future, we can ultimate editions, so I can retire my old DVDs for good!
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Riviting reading right till the end.Different from his previous well researched novels as it is more inventive. The end is brilliant  but totally unexpected and the cops don't win.<br />John
B002SSUQFG|3.0|The watch is solid and Seiko is a good brand, but the body of the watch is a lot smaller than It looks online. The face is about the size of a USD quarter. Not what I was expecting.

B0034G4P26|4.0|An interesting Pirate story, different then the usual Pirate story, but interesting. Not up to the standard of previous movies from this group.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. My first of this author's, maybe I should read Harry Potter after all. The characters were a fascinating study of people watching. I felt I knew these characters and where the lived. I couldn't put it down and wanted it to go on forever. I hope there's more adult fiction coming our way
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grabbed my interest from page one! Fast paced, a fun read. Couldn't put it down. Good ending . Engaging characters!
B004UFEJXK|1.0|I have no idea how this movie gets the praise it does. After watching the movie for 25 minutes it became unbearable to continue to watch. I normally like some bad movies because they are occasionally fun to make fun of while watching but this movie was such a let down its hard to put into words. No action no talking just a whole lot of boring mundane things taking place. I'm sorry no I don't care about my vacuum cleaner why should I care about Wall E? It is not emotional it is not mesmerizing it is not some sort of paradigm shift that people make it out to be where you get so emotionally tied to the characters. Additional dialog was definitely needed and no most kids that watch this will wonder if the sound is broken and why there is some stupid looking robot moving around on screen so don't expect to pop this movie in and get a two hour break. For those that enjoy this movie great for those would like something a little more ground breaking and entertaining try some anime movies there a few great ones out there like Akira or Princess Mononoke.

0375836675|5.0|Markus Zusak's story of an average joe leaving his mark on the world is incredible. He manages to expose the most raw emotions in a way that leaves you both laughing and crying. When I am having a bad day, be it a loss of motivation or the worst break up imaginable, I can read just a section of this book and know that everything is alright. I am an avid reader, and this may just be the best book I've ever read.

1840221828|5.0|I am one who resonates deeply with the kind of themes that Kafka treats in his works: bureaucracy, meaning, connection, relationships, and how hierarchy impacts the way we experience and sit in the world. This is an unfinished novel--this is true. But if  you have read any Kafka, I you probably understand that this plain simple truth should not deter a venture into the text. In fact, the mid-sentence ends in just the right spot--it leaves the reader with the resounding feeling that in fact the feeling you've been having the entire book--namely that K, the main character, is forever stuck in a maze of absurd bureaucratic run-arounds--is how life for K will be for the indefinite future. There is no major epiphany. No breakthrough that makes the previous 270 pages feel as if they were actually building to some transcendent moment. I gravitate toward texts that attempt to show--and not just tell--about this feature of our existence. The reality, I believe, Kafka is proposing is that we aren't necessarily building to any logical apex of life or existence. We spin our wheels and then once we kick the bucket, the rest of us go on spinning, churning, grasping for some shred of meaning. Kafka had this all figured out. Amen.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one of John Grisham's best works so far.  I couldn't put this book down.  The author has written often about wrongful incarceration, but this book also has a great payback to the feds.  Thinking about the cool plot makes me smile.  Maybe it's just my libertarian side that made it so great.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love the new spin-off of Angry Birds. It will keep you hooked for a long time assured. If you were to download any game, I would suggest this one.

B009JZTOG8|4.0|Season (2) has the characters &#34;fleshed out&#34; now, so the concentration is on stepping up to the next level, for each actor/actress.  Keep going!

B000FC0SIM|5.0|This book by Stephen King is part autobiographical and part instructional for anyone who wants to be a writer. On Writing is very entertaining and educational. I recommend it to anyone who wants to be a writer or to anyone who is a Stephen King fan.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|It may be an erotic book, but it has such a beautiful love story to it. My fave book this year!
B007WFTFG6|3.0|The coloring part works well, but it's easy for toddler fingers to run over a different color on the side and change to one he didn't want.  The pictures choices aren't that great either.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I liked it.  It paints a picture of wartime in Europe and what it was like for the people in that time.
B0053O89YM|5.0|If you liked seasons 1 and 2 you won't be disappointed.  It's hard not to watch them straight through.  Eli Gold develops as a character and perhaps Kalinda is not invincible.

B000BB1MI2|5.0|I love this movie . The movie came faster than I expected I was so happy to open it can't wait to watch it
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great insight to the Navy Seals.  I have no doubt that this account was mostly if not all accurate...if not it was a good read.  I couldn't put it down...author does a good job of giving you some background and yet you bought this book to hear about Bin Laden...I found myself enjoying the stories and wanting some background info...it also gave you a better understanding of what skills it took to pull something like this off.  The intimate details of the killing I did not know, and I enjoyed this account...couldn't put it down in the final chapters and stayed up till one AM finishing it!

1936608618|5.0|So I have been following CFE for at least a year. I WISH this book was around when I started. I haven't been able to read the entire thing yet, but here is a breakdown on what I have read.<br /><br />Running: A bunch of focus on running form, and bunch of drills to improve. Even if you do not feel that the high intensity running plan that CFE champions is the way you like to train, this book is worth it just to help you re- work your form.<br /><br />Bike (partially through): I own a bike but haven't gotten too serious, and i am glad. The book covers the proper fit for all types of bikes and more.<br /><br />Lifts (Skimmed): All laid on in photos. No more youtubing crossfit workouts to figure out what the heck a \\"Thruster\\" is.<br /><br />Mobility (Skimmed): All taken care of by K-Star. If you don't know who he is, then check out mobilitywod.com.<br /><br />If you are a CFE regular, this is a consolidation of a bunch of their data + more. Any one of these chapters would be worth the price of admission. I already own the Pose book, but BMak's explanation and drills are a lot easier to follow. If you have any doubts, head over to endurancewod.com to check out the sample chapters.
0761166173|5.0|My son's favorite bedtime story book.  We order one for each of our new friends' children.  Unfortunately they are made in China.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Lots of details in the beginning but it quickly becomes hard to pit down.  Te ending is amazing.  I could not believe it.  Now I am looking forward to the movie.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|Raised more questions than it answered. The sceens were also inferior to those on the original Alien or most of the sequels, but still pretty cool. It's a good movie for a Saturday evening after a couple of beers and some popcorn.
B0021L9MJG|4.0|It is hard to justify a five star review - I mean, Creepshow wasn't going to win any Academy Awards. . .then again, does that really matter? This is both a classic 80s anthology and a very well put together horror film. Creepshow has everything - good direction, great writing, solid acting, quirky humor, fun special effects and Tom Atkins. Every story in this film has its positive merits and holds the viewer's interest. This Blu-ray is reasonably priced and looks great. This is a very nice restoration and well worth the reasonable price this Blu-ray typically sells for. The soundtrack is nicely encoded and has some decent (though not jaw dropping) speaker separation. Highly recommended.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Exellent movie more new releases would be great especially in 1080p, Home theater buffs which their is a lot of like picture quality, It's what makes their theater great, especially with the $$$ they have invested. People should not have to pay a fee for movies that are years and years and years old. (Just my opinion.)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many, many titles and authors of NDE experiences and was very excited to see this story published by a physician... a \\"hardcore\\" neurosurgeon no less (I have been an R.N. for 40 years so know how \\"surgeons think\\" :)). Dr. Alexander's struggle with expressing his experiences, thoughts, and feelings was uplifting and refreshing. He did a wonderful job attempting to illustrate both the physiologic and metaphysicial aspects of his NDE and his success at reconciling that polarity in his post-NDE life. I highly recommend this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Full screen,  keys &amp; background is easy on the eye. Very large keys,  #'s are easy to see. It is a very basic Cal., but is all most people will every need. One of the best apps. for kindle. love and use all the rimmed.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I watch most TV shows on Hulu but since CBS doesn't use Hulu, I decided to try an episode or two (which turned into an entire season pass) of Elementary. I loved reading Sherlock Holmes and love all things Sherlock Holmes (except for the second Robert Downey, Jr. film?). I love Lucy Liu as Watson. Really refreshing take. Jonny Lee Miller brings a great manic energy to the role. It's an interesting take on a procedural show, which everyone notes was probably taken from Sherlock Holmes stories in the first place.
B007Z5M6F0|5.0|Wonderful movie all around.  The acting was superb, and the story was epic.  I love war movies especially when the soldiers have something worth fighting for besides their country.  To love and to be loved= that's what it's all about.  I love Eddie Redmayne.  Such an awesome actor.

B009JTCBLE|5.0|I love music that will grow on me, Black Country Communion has done this with each of their albums. Each one is a little different and Afterglow continues to get better every time I listen to it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Love the album in total.  I have bought an additional five for Christmas gifts.  This is the best of Susan Boyle's four albums to date. The songs were well chosen and Susan's voice comes through wonderfully on every song on this album.  I have been asked to play the album over again by friends and family.  I have bought each of Susan's four albums and the Japanese edition of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" which includes the additional song \\"Wings To Fly\\".
0345803493|3.0|EL James knows how to write about sex; unfortunately the rest of the book is awful, and unrealistic.  Not well written, and the authors heritage oozes out, so she should have just had the plot take place in Europe somewhere.

B002DKF47O|5.0|Behemoth don't exactly break new ground on their ninth full-length, 2009's \\"Evangelion.\\" Sure, the record might make use of some Egyptian musicianship, orchestration, keyboards, trumpets, horns, trombones, and tubas, but it is far from being an experimental release like 2007's \\"Apostasy\\" was. Instead, for the most part, Behemoth just give the fans more of what they want, delivering truckloads of smoking riffs, pummeling blast beats, intricate leads, technical solos, and furious death metal bellows. As such, no matter how familiar it may sound, this album is hard for any metalhead to dislike. And besides, there is one aspect that is unique to \\"Evangelion,\\" and that is its fluidity -- the songs flow well into each other, thus producing seamless, wall-to-wall sequencing.<br /><br />\\"Daimonos\\" begins with a chilling, commanding, spoken-word intro before slamming into a brick wall of death-thrash with devastating blasts, scalding, Slayer-worthy thrash riffing, and rip-roaring rhythms. And the latter half of this song is highlighted by an excellent, lengthy, technically-impressive guitar solo. \\"Shemhamforash\\" works in similar fashion, beginning with a brief melodic intro before BAM!, you are smacked across the face by a full-on assault of head-spinning, blast beat-propelled black/death metal chaos. A pair of whipping and careening solos pops up, here, too, although the song does end on a restrained and nuanced note, with a splash of mysteriously colorful, epic-sounding Spanish-guitar strumming in the outro. \\"Ov Fire And The Void\\" begins as a mostly mid-tempo venture, with a martial, cascading drum solo, strong, chugging bass line, and ominous wall of feedback. Some chunky guitars and thumping drum beats come smashing in, but the song never really takes off, out of restrained territory and into brutal, full-on thrash territory, until about three-minutes in.<br /><br />\\"Transmigrating Beyond Realms Ov Amenti,\\" however, is a truly breakneck endeavor with blistering buzzsaw riffing, furious drumming, and bottom-of-the-gut growling. Inferno's drumming is really impressive in this song, as he shows off some very dexterous and thrashy fills; but the real highlight, here, is when the guitarists -- Nergal and Seth -- trade-off wild, shredding, screaming solos. \\"He Who Breeds Pestilence\\" begins on a relatively trippy note, with the sound of a few bird noises. Soon thereafter, though, it turns to punishing, hyper-speed picking and drumming. But the track does retain a certain melodic sensibility, as it does feature some seemingly innocent and docile guitar strumming and some nicely melodic -- if easy to overlook -- soloing in the outro. \\"The Seed Ov I\\" is backed by hefty, forceful, muscular rhythms, bottom-heavy chugging, and is also highlighted by a brief but cool, rolling drum solo, and two great, and fairly darn wailing guitar solos.<br /><br />\\"Alas, Lord Is Upon Me\\" is much like \\"The Seed...\\" in that it begins with a few booming opening power chords (and backing guitar harmonies), before gradually gaining momentum, and eventually hitting hyper-speed territory with chunky, steamrolling riffs and breakneck drumming. \\"Defiling Morality Ov Black God\\" is, essentially, a blast-fest from start to finish. It boils over with crushing, mind-boggling, and at-times \\"rat-tat-tat\\" machine-gun blasting. (Inferno's double kick work is truly blistering, here, and his snare-battery is virtuosic.) Lastly, if far from least, the album wraps up with \\"Lucifer,\\" a truly, bone-chillingly dark and ominous piece of straight-up, droning doom metal.<br /><br />In the end, Behemoth's songwriting may have stalled a bit, here, but their musical delivery is still top-notch. Every song explodes with enough convincing vigor and enthusiasm. As such, whether revving up the engines or settling down into a comparatively slow dirge, there is nary a single weak moment to be found anywhere on this album. Therefore, \\"Evangelion\\" might not bring anything really new or innovative to the table, but it nonetheless still makes for a very satisfying listen.o the table, but it nonetheless still makes for a very satisfying listen.

B005LAIHAE|3.0|Henry Cavill (Theseus of Tarsem Singh-directed epic \\"Immortals\\") plays a young American businessman Will, who has just arrived in Spain to meet his family. While out on a yacht with his father Martin (Bruce Willis), mother Laurie (Caroline Goodall), young brother Josh (Rafi Gavron) and Josh's fiancée Dara (Emma Hamilton), Will makes a mistake and one of them gets injured. To buy a medicine, Will goes on shore alone, but when Will comes back, he finds everyone on the boat has disappeared.<br /><br />\\"The Cold Light of Day\\" starts promisingly, and then it slowly loses momentum through a whole heap of cliché. Without revealing too much about the story, the US-Spanish thriller is about an American on foreign soil, who gets involved in a web of intrigue.<br /><br />The film's basic idea (a bit sounds like \\"Frantic\\") is not bad. The problem is its poor execution. In short, the film has no style. Characters, storytelling, acting and action set-pieces - everything in the film is just OK, and nothing more. Some action stunts are impressive, and so are the film's on-location shots (in Madrid), but they are wasted among the banal narrative that no one is really interested.<br /><br />French director Mabrouk El Mechri (known for his unique mocumentary/meta-film \\"JCVD\\" starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as himself) directs \\"The Cold Light of Day,\\" written by Scott Wiper (director of \\"The Condemned\\") and John Petro. In addition to the players mentioned above, the cast of \\"The Cold Light of Day\\" includes Verónica Echegui, Colm Meaney (in a cameo role), Roschdy Zem and Sigourney Weaver with a gun. The film's photography is by Remi Adefarasin (\\"Elizabeth\\").<br /><br />With names and talent attached to it, \\"The Cold Light of Day\\" could have been a more thrilling suspense. As it is, it only feels like watching a drawn-out episode for a TV show.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I've read all of the Jack Reacher novels and this one did not disappoint.  You forget that there is probably no human as wise and street smart as he is, but who cares, he's a great character and I always find myself waiting for the next installment.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|One look at the title tells you all you need to know. Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter. Based on a novel of the same title by Seth Grahame-Smith (author of a bestselling book \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\"), \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" is a vampire-hunting action flick with period costumes, that takes itself very seriously.<br /><br />Benjamin Walker plays Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States by day, and a secret vampire hunter by night. Trained by mysterious Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper), young Abraham Lincoln has become a formidable vampire killer with a silver axe. Lincoln then enters politics, and he meets and falls in love with Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).<br /><br />Produced by Tim Burton and directed by Timur Bekmambetov (\\"Night Watch\\" \\"Wanted\\"), \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" is visually impressive, to be certain, with the movie's over-the-top visual spectacle that is sometimes outlandish, even surreal, but the film lacks the playfulness that Angelina Jolie brought in the same director's \\"Wanted.\\" The story is not very interesting. We don't know what the film's Lincoln wants to do; neither do we know what the enemy vampires are after. After all, why should we care?<br /><br />\\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" doesn't know what it wants to be. As dark fantasy, vampire action or so-called mash-up, the film is weak, with a story that feels rushed, and characters that are not very interesting.

B009VB9VKY|3.0|Ladies will watch this movie to see mostly naked guys.  Guys will watch this movie to make their wife or girlfriend happy.  Otherwise, there isn't much reason to see this one.  No real plot to speak of and the acting was lame as well.<br /><br />The part my wife liked the most was that Channing Tatum actually did all of the dance scenes, no doubles.  Apparently he was a dancer (of sorts) prior to breaking through in the movie business.

0811875555|5.0|This book is superior because it has lots of art, attractively and legibly arraigned on the page, and lots of hand drawn art.  Other books these days feature digital art that looks rather cold and superficial, or drawings that strain for \\"modern\\" effect through distortion or other outre gimmicks, but \\"The Art of Tangled\\" has plenty of solid, thoughtful drawing and paintings with a human feel and best of all, lots of Glen Keane art.  Keane is truly a modern master.  His work always has that personal touch, lots of depth, humor, freshness, spontaneity, character insight and personality, and the other artists really follow his lead and put their hearts into it.  You can learn a lot about how to draw and animate by studying this work.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is my favorite author. He has never let me down with any of his books. His John Corey series is my favorite. However, this book was way too full of sarcasm. The content was interesting, but you tend to get lost in all the wisecracks. I was disappointed. I am hopeful his next encounter will get back to his original greatness.<br />Juanita
