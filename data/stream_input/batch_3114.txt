B00358ESI4|5.0|The acting was strong and believable as well as the action and special effects.  Everything was so realistic!  I found it to be a very powerful movie, partly because it also included scenes of what the families left behind had to go through.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|I played the first and enjoyed it this one is a little more challenging but just as much fun if not more
B00417HV14|5.0|Joe is the man!  This performance, like so many from him that i have been privileged to view, is flawless and highly entertaining.  Not only one (if not THE) of the best electric blues and rock guitarists of all time, but an outstanding vocalist as well.  What gets me about him is his humble nature.  If you like blues, you need to check out Joe at the Royal Albert Hall. As always his backing band is off the charts.

B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|Back in the day, every Saturday at 11:00PM, the coolest radio station in my hometown played entire *albums* over the AIR. The Point!, Nilsson Schmilsson, and Son of Schmilsson were staples of that Midnight Hour.  Those late-night spins reintroduced my generation to Harry Nilsson, the ONLY American the Beatles thought worth listening to... Sigh. I'm one of the lucky few to own the MONO version of Aerial Ballet. Mint Condition. Never been played. A gift from my schizophrenic older brother, who said: \\"You *need* this.\\" I think I was all of seven at the time. I also own a first pressing of The Point! -- complete with its cartoon booklet. And I'm one of the few people who treasure That's The Way It Is... for \\"Moonshine Bandit.\\"  I kinda, sorta, *needed* Nilsson: The RCA Albums collection<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) Has some nice extras that are previously unreleased and/or available on out-of-print soundtracks-- \\"Waiting\\" from *Jenny* and \\"Ain't It Kind of Wonderful\\" from *The World's Greatest Lover* are two of the songs.<br />2) Has radio spots for most of the albums. My favorite is The Travel Brochure Promo for The Point!<br />3) Has the hilarious B-side \\"Buy My Album\\" made to promote The Point! which contains songs NOT on said album.<br />4) Has Stereo and Mono versions of both Pandemonium Shadow Show and Aerial Ballet<br />5) Great gift for all Nilsson fans -- and for those you want to *become* Harry Heads. Grin.<br />6) Has Spanish and Italian versions of a few of Harry's songs.<br />7) Nice, compact size that will fit into your \\"escape box\\" for those nasty fire and flood evacuations.<br />8) One can NEVER have too much Harry Nilsson -- or too many books!<br />9) Harry Nilsson is, quite simply, aural joy!<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) If you own any of the CDs with Bonus Tracks, you'll have some duplicates.  As a collector, those duplicate tracks were worth it to me.<br />2) Doesn't include the *Son of Dracula* soundtrack. Son of Dracula duplicates Nilsson Schmilsson and Son of Schmilsson and was felt to be redundant. RCA releases stereo and mono versions of not one by TWO albums and then goes on about redundancy. Just sayin'. Grin.<br />3) If you have any manual dexterity issues, the wee envelopes may drive you to distraction. (My friend helped me take the CDs out and re-home them.)<br />4) Doesn't come with the cartoon booklet for The Point! I'm sure there were copyright issues in play, but REALLY?!<br /><br />All in all, I love this \\"RCA Albums Collection.\\" It's not complete, but it DOES have his best work, along with all the albums we listened to on those long-ago midnights. There are a few omissions, but it's *still* worth every cent -- especially if you don't already own the CDs with bonus tracks. Buy this set, stay home next Saturday night, turn the lights down low and get reacquainted with Harry Nilsson.  You won't be sorry.<br /><br />PS: It's got to be *good* if it's got 4 CONS *and* a 5 Star Review. Grin.n of Schmilsson and was felt to be redundant.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|It was a heartbreaking beautifully written story. A very realistic story of love and survival from a believable point of view.<br />I will look forward to the movie.<br />Penny from MA
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This Product is great i gave it to my partner for his birthday. We do not use it with a phone we use it to stream from our laptop with the google cast app for computers.
B00CZ7OC46|5.0|Admitted: I have been working remotely for more than 25 years. I just never understood why people were so obsessed with having an office. This book is written by someone running a software company. The type of company that do not need sales, production and physical logistics. The book is very much like a recent book about working for WordPress, another software company.  Remote working in the software industry is obvious, however it can be done in any type of company to some extend.<br /><br />The book is well written and gives a good overall review of the upsides and how to cope with the downsides.<br /><br />Recommendable to anyone interested in getting more done and having a better life.
B00004RF83|4.0|Why is price so high.And no DVD's just blu-ray? A very good movie but you aren't offering DVD. Don't have blu-ray but even if I did $60 seems way high.

1451666179|5.0|Oh my Gosh I absolutely LOVE this book and wish she had made it longer. The stories are hilarious. The pictures hysterical. I love her warped and twisted sense of humor! Can I add all the extra stars here? If you like her blog, you'll love her book! More More More!
B002ZG99QS|4.0|Wonderful movie.  Not as good as the original but it is entertaining and the special effects are worth watching.  I would recommend this movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I couldn't wait to start this season.  I immediately began watching after finishing season 2.  I can't wait until season 4!!!!  Drama with a glorious backdrop and wonderful cast.  The costume department did a wonderful job as always.  kudos to all the production crews!
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Definitely not what I expected.  Interesting, new take on zombies.  It wasn't a great movie but was worth watching once.  I hear the book is much better.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not as good as his earliest books, obviously, but a fantastic light read. Not even remotely believable, but fun nonetheless.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a wonderful game! I watched my 3 yr. old Grandson play this game and after her went home, I went on to &quot;try&quot; the game to see if &quot;I&quot; could gain enough bananas to buy him the &quot;baby minion&quot; costume and since then I couldn't put it down! It's the cutest little GAME with just enough challenge to keep you interested and coming back. I would suggest that everyone try this game!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I needed a new streaming media player for my tv and I decided to try out the Google Chromecast media player.  It works out great with Netflix and Hulu Plus.  It does not stream all the videos from your computer yet but it may in the future.  The great thing about this item is that I do not have to plug it in to my outlets, the usbs withing my tv just keep it charged.  If I need another streaming device, i'll just purchase another one of these.
B008JFUS28|4.0|The plot of &#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34; centers on an ominous cosmic singularity that puts the known realms, including earth, at risk, thanks to some evil elves left over from the darkness at the beginning of time. Remember to pay attention during the introduction, or the movie will be hard to follow.<br /><br />The story picks up where the &#34;Thor&#34; and &#34;Avenger&#34; movies left it, with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in Asgard missing his mortal girl, his mischief-making brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) confined to a dungeon, and Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) on earth and about to stumble into a dark and evil substance called aether. Jane's encounter will raise the dark elves from their long slumber, trigger an horrendous invasion of Asgard, and force tough choices on Thor, including having to defy his father and to trust Loki...<br /><br />The special effects are terrific. Asgard is visually stunning as the abode of the Norse gods. The sinister ship of the dark elves looks realistic in space and in London. The fight scenes with the dark elves are thrilling.  The dialogue is quite good.  Jane’s friends (Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard) provide some welcome comic relief). The plot moves along smartly, with many moments of suspense and misdirection, lightened by some wonderful sight gags.<br /><br />&#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34; is good entertainment, especially for those familiar with the Marvel universe of superheroes, and recommended.  Stay through the credits of a hint on the next movie.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|It was a film I could watch with my 11 year old grandson.  The boy in the film was 11 years old and Aidan could relate.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun,  really makes you concentrate and use your memory.  Some took me longer and I almost got frustrated but I finished!
B004XZR63M|4.0|This book is everything it promise and more; I read it, and read it to my kids and we all love it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Was worried second season would not be as good as first but my worries were put to rest in first episode. This series is professionally done. Loved the first part when they interviewed owner of the house (Highclere?) that they are filming in. Lots of drama to keep your interest, some of which you can't see how they are going to turn around, some they don't manage to. Very well done.
0441020712|5.0|Blue Remembered Earth (2012) is the first SF novel in the Poseidon's Children series.  It is set in Africa, on the Moon, and elsewhere a century and half from now.  Humanity is spreading out from Earth, but their machines are much wider spread.  Various commercial interests are more satisfied with machines than human presence, but other factions insist that real humans should be leading the diaspora.<br /><br />In this novel, Geoffrey Akinya is a thirty-two year old biologist.  He is studying the minds and behaviors of elephants.<br /><br />Sunshine Akinya is an artist.  She is also Geoffrey's sister and two years older than him. She lives on the Moon with Jiendra.<br /><br />Eunice Akinya is the grandmother of Geoffrey and Sunshine.  She has been a pioneer in space for decades before she retired to the Winter Palace, a satellite in orbit around the Moon.<br /><br />Hector and Lucas Akinya are cousins of Geoffrey and Sunshine.  They are closely involved in the family business.<br /><br />Memphis Chibesa is the Akinya estate caretaker in what had been Kenya.  He has been managing Akinya affairs for decades.<br /><br />Jiendra Gupta is a designer of intelligent machines.  He has contracts from Plexus.<br /><br />June Wing is the CEO of Plexus, a manufacturer of intelligent machines.<br /><br />Chama Akbulat is a biologist who collects and genetically modifies flora and fauna.  He is the significant other of Gleb.<br /><br />Gleb Ozerov is slightly older than Chama.  He and Chama are Panspermians.<br /><br />In this story, Geoffrey and Sunshine were children playing in the back of their house.  They found a war machine buried near the river bank.  It tried to capture Sunshine's mind, but Memphis rescued the kids.<br /><br />In 2161, Geoffrey is returning from his observations of an elephant clan when Memphis contacts him.  He notifies Geoffrey of the death of his grandmother.  She was a hundred and thirty-one years old, but still had been mentally vigorous.<br /><br />Memphis went to the Winter Palace to bring back Eunice's ashes.  Many relatives and friends attended the ceremony of scattering her ashes.  Sunday came in the body of a new form of proxy.  Geoffrey notices a proxy shaped like a young girl whom he doesn't know.<br /><br />A few days after the ceremony, Hector and Lucas contact Geoffrey about a safe deposit box on the Moon.  It had shown up as an asset of Eunice's estate.  They suspect that it contains data that would blacken the family name.  So the cousins want Geoffrey to check on the contents of the box.<br /><br />They offer additional funding for Geoffrey's elephant studies.  That offer and the chance to visit his sister convinces Geoffrey to accept the task.  He says his farewells to the elephants and goes up the beanstalk to a ship going to the Moon.<br /><br />On Luna, Geoffrey checks the safe deposit box and only finds a glove from a Moon suit.  He takes it with him and goes to visit Sunday.  She is living in the Descrutinized Zone, where public surveillance is forbidden.  Unlike the Earth and other place, privacy is possible within the Zone.<br /><br />Sunshine and Jiendra meet him at the train station.  They take him home to a stack to shipping containers made into apartments.  Geoffrey tells Sunshine what he had been doing on the Moon.<br /><br />Sunshine shows Geoffrey a construct she has made of Eunice.  The virtual being looks like Eunice and contains all data available on her grandmother.  She knows that there is more information that is not included in the construct, but still uses the virtual being as a consultant on her grandmother's life and wanderings.<br /><br />They remove the contents of the glove -- colored plastic gems -- and brainstorm on the reason that Eunice had left it in the box.  They decide that the glove is a clue to another location.  The number of gems reminds Jiendra of something.  A few hours later, Jiendra recalls the memory.<br /><br />The glove points to the Pythagoras Crater, a place that Eunice had visited long ago.  There are signs of a later visit, including a scuffed spot where she might have buried something.  Unfortunately, the coordinates are within the Chinese region and they don't like trespassers.<br /><br />Jiendra takes Geoffry to the Robot Wars, an area where obsolete robots are used to try new algorithms and fight each other.  There Geoffry meets June and learns that Plexus sponsors Jiendra's team.  Geoffrey gets to take a drug that slows down his metabolism and perception so he can observe a robotic match.<br /><br />Then Sunshine introduces Geoffrey to Chama and Gleb.  He gets to see the menagerie, a number of minihabitats containing plants and animals.  One even has a trio of dwarf elephants.<br /><br />Chama decides to penetrate the Ghost Wall and takes a suborbital to Pythagoras.  Sunshine, Jiendra, Geoffrey and Gleb ching to Chama's shuttle and try to talk him into coming back. The Chinese warns him several time to turn back, but Chama continues on.<br /><br />This tale involves Geoffrey with the Panspermian Initiative.  They make him an offer to fund the elephant studies in exchange for allowing the dwarf elephants to ching into his herd and socialize.  Geoffrey refuses the offer for ethical reasons.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Sunshine and Jiendra take a fast ship to Mars.  Five weeks later, they are on Phobos.  Sunshine finds another clue in a long deserted habitat on that moon.<br /><br />Sunshine and Geoffrey get into more trouble.  The next installment in this sequence is [[ASIN:0575090456 On the Steel Breeze]].<br /><br />Highly recommended for Reynolds fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of interplanetary adventures, mysterious quests, and a bit of romance.  Read and enjoy!<br /><br />-Arthur W. Jordin
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|There is not a song on this CD that I do not like.  Very sensual! I love it. Robert Glasper had done it again.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game,especially for free! Graphics are good, can be a little challenging to get scope right and steady to shoot. But still a lot of fun!
074356619X|5.0|Keep this in my car and listen to it often. I highly recommend it to any practioners who need an &#34;infusion&#34; in the car/office or who have to deal less-than-ideal commutes.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|As an original Trekkie (as in, I was actually there when the original Star Trek came out), I was saddened by the lack of original material in this movie.  It's OK to rehash the past, but for next time hire some new writers that can put in some NEW content!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I thought this was a film drama about a plane crash but really its a drama about an alcoholic who was in a plane crash. Its not surprising that many people do not like seeing Denzel in a role where the character is completely flawed, we like to see Denzel as the nice guy, good guy hero. I think Denzel should be very proud of this performance as it is a difficult role. The flight crash in this film is thrilling but it only takes up a small portion of the film, the rest is a character study of a man who had achieved greatness but sacrifices it all. Its a morality play where someone has the choice of lying and ridding themselves of a steep penalty or telling the truth where the only reward is a clean conscience and a sense of personal integrity. The choice may seem obvious but its not. After watching the film there was a part of me that felt he should have just lied, just one more time, that the stakes were too high and he would sacrifice too much but those stakes are ones that would have saved this characters life.  This is a grown up film so if you simply want to be entertained without having to think too deeply about the moral issues involved then this probably isn't for  you.
B004WE01YA|5.0|I bought this 3D combo set when it was still in stores! I have loved &#34;Beauty and the Beast&#34; since I was a little kid back in the 90s! My favourite character is Lumi&egrave;re! :D I have watched this movie over and over and over again! I never get tired of it and it never gets old! Every time I watch it, I always feel like I can be their guest and put their service to the test! We always enjoy every minute of this timeless classic! Be it on the Blu-ray or going back to my childhood and watching it on VHS! I highly recommend this Disney classic! It's a tale as old as time.. :)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this game. Get a bit confused when changing levels.  Seems you must sit out a few day, and just keep playing until you can move on.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Storylines are varied and intriguing.  Lots of surprises.  Fast paced action.  Return of &#34;friends&#34; from previous seasons.  Loved seeing Nathan Lane turning up this week. Looks like he'll be around for awhile.  Gary Cole's character keeps the blood flowing.  No one can be complacent with his opposite views.  &#34;David Lee&#34; somehow gets worse and &#34;they&#34; are letting him.  What an obnoxious guy!  Love seeing &#34;Alicia&#34;s kids have their own avenues of exploration.  What neat kids they are.  Shock!  The ethics gal is pregnant.  Hmmm!  Who's the guy?  Is she married?  Did I miss something?  The script writers are certainly tantalizing we viewers.
B00F5PS5P2|4.0|Lauren Mayberry's voice combined with the electro-synth-pop sound is great, but don't expect anything deep from the lyrics.  The album has good flow and range in its variety.<br /><br />The extra cost for the special edition was worthwhile.
B0031RAOVY|3.0|oh my god this movie had to be the saddest movie i HAVE  every seen, I cried and just could not bare the loss this dog experienced, if you are a sensitive soul, and are not in the mood for your heart being torn apart I suggest you do not watch this movie, otherwise it is a beautiful story but too sad for me, just thinking about it to write this brings tears to my eyes.
1849904251|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone who is a BBC Sherlock fan. There are articles by the writers and in depth examination of the episodes and the style of the book gives an added dimension to fans of both Sherlock and John.<br /><br />Of course this book is also pretty funny, I laughed a few times while reading. My only complaint and it's not much of a complaint is that the book is a bit smaller than I thought it would be. Anyway, love the glossy jacket and the book arrived in excellent condition! XD
B007SGM084|5.0|I love these books! To have them sold all together is really good. I just had PDF files that my friend gave me, and it's nice to have the real copies on my kindle
0316322407|5.0|I got the book for my teenage daughter so she can learn and appreciate what we have in USA. I really love the story of all the girls in the world that day to day fight for the right to belong to the world through Education. It is definitely an amazing story for our non-appreciated society. Freedom is also part being able to be a woman and have the right to get an Education.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|this is the best album you can and should by this year. play this out loud piss off all the pop wannabes. get the deluxe version you wont regret it. the haters can all suck both these and they're free feast up. death to pop music. keep it up marshal show these whiney punks how we roll..
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|WAs really surprised to find that this app doesn't give you a keyboard when trying to respond to an email.  Also couldn't figure out how to write any new E-mail messages with this new version.  IT divides things into two columns which makes the print too small to read.  Wish I hadn't wasted my dollar on this.<br />Pmerrill
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like a lot of other people, I have also been waiting for this game to come to the Amazon kindle. Addicting and fun.

B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Seeing Douglas Preston in person (twice) and Lincoln Child via Skype (once), I can’t help but be enthralled by the eccentricities of these two individuals, and the odd dynamic that must ensue from this powerful writing duo. So it’s hard not to see how Aloysius Pendergast might have developed from these two brilliant minds fully formed and ready for action. He’s odd and eccentric and intriguing and his dark suits never manage to get wrinkle, even when he’s bounding through snow drifts up to his chin or playing Russian roulette with a loaded revolver.<br /><br />More than just Pendergast, though, WHITE FIRE filled its pages with entertaining characters and a few individuals from the days of yore. With Corrie Swanson leading the charge and immersing herself in skeletal remains and mining caves and mountain passes, this novel piles on roadblocks and adventures in equal measure, and then douses the remains in cans of kerosene. With stoic individuals stepping to the forefront and the interweaving of a story within a story, this novel moves forward as much as it lingers in antiquity. Arthur Conan Doyle and Oscar Wilde and Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson weave through the pages, leaving footprints in white blankets and half-eaten meals behind.<br /><br />The rush of adrenaline helped me maneuver from the first page to the last, the throttle easing just enough to keep me from overexertion, the pages pounding with the precision of a jackhammer. The vibrations echoed through my hands and all the way up my forearms, as I drove my snowmobile through the ensuing avalanche. The tight plot fit about as well as a snug pair of gloves, and I leaned my back from the resultant wind current, my teeth chattering and my feet stamping in protest.<br /><br />If you don’t mind Pendergast avoiding the spotlight as opposed to standing in the limelight, acting more as a mentor than the lead investigator, and you enjoy your plots more tightly woven than a pair of mittens, you’ll probably find yourself enjoying this Colorado tale.<br /><br />I received this book for free through NetGalley.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigatorly find yourself enjoying this Colorado tale.<br /><br />I received this book for free through NetGalley.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator
B00ERIUO02|4.0|There is not a single song on this album where Katy Perry did not help write. It seems like Katy Perry really dug into her life to reveal her true colors,at least some of them.  While yes, some of these songs are pretty cookie-cutter; but they are pretty good. A lot of tracks seem to be similar in nature, melody, but overall it is a good album.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are: Choose Your Battles, Unconditionally, Birthday, This is How We Do, Double Rainbow, Ghost, Dark Horse.  Some of these just speak to me, others are catchy, and make me feel good.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|thought this was a very good book ... enjoyed the way the story came together and loved the epilogue.  Read it for sure.

B00BOUL9DM|5.0|It a lot fun!<br />alot is easy! A lot<br />very hard!<br />just wished I could figure<br />Out the hard ones!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Sure, stock keyboards may work fine for some folks. I just happen to find the responsiveness and advanced settings of SwiftKey meet my exact demands and it is worth supporting this developer by purchasing the app. Perhaps it will be as useful to you as well.

B000FC12YQ|5.0|I think this is one of the last Hercule Poirot mysteries since the detective has supposedly retired to a small town in England.  None the less, his &#34;little grey cells&#34; are as sharp as ever in solving this mystery, actually two murders.<br />The ending was a total surprise, as it should be.  Agatha Christi's writing is superb as always, even though I didn't understand all the vocabulary.  If I were British, I'm sure I would, but it really made little difference.  Enjoy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW!  Watched the entire 3rd season in one late night while my husband was out of town in NY.

B000OCXIDK|1.0|Did not like this book at all.I  kept waiting for something to happen,I thought they were building up to something  and it just kept going on and on then it ended.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  There are few movies I have walked out of wanting to turn around and see again immediately (The Dark Knight, The Avengers, Terminator 2 to name a couple).  There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said.<br />I will say this to the fans that cry \\"Superman doesn't kill.\\"  I am not very versed in the loooooong history of the comics so I can't comment who he has or hasn't killed during that run.  But at the end of Superman 2 The Movie, Superman kills Zod.  Don't believe me, watch this clip and fast forward to 3:50:  [...]<br />As for all the destruction to Metropolis (and Smallville) and all the lives lost (Man of Steel):  How would you fair your first time out fighting a small army of indestructible aliens?  Up to that point, all he had done was save a few lives.  Battling supervillains hadn't even crossed his mind yet.  Hell, he had just learned to fly and shoot lasers from his eyes.  And Zod flat out told him that if he didn't stop him he would kill every human on the fracking planet.<br />Sorry, I'm off my soapbox now.  Great movie, can't wait for Superman Vs Batman or whatever it'll be called.

B00FAT9W0A|4.0|Before reviewing this CD, please note that there are multiple formats of this 'best of'. There is the single CD, there is a double CD (with an extra disk of B sides and other assorted one-offs) and there is the all-out double CD with DVD combo/box set (the DVD consists of a special August 2013 acoustic set with setlist chosen by the fans). This review is of the single CD compilation.<br /><br />\\"Best of Keane\\" (20 tracks; 79 min.) brings a 10th anniversary chronological overview of the British band which shone bright on its two initial albums. 2003's \\"Hope and Fears\\" still stands as one of the more accomplished debut albums of the '00s, and was an immediate critical and commercial success across the board. Hence my slight surprise that there are 'only' 5 tracks from it on here (all 5 UK singles: Everybody's Changing; Somewhere Only We Know; Bend and Break; Bedshaped; This Is The Last Time). I would've added Untitled 1 as a must-have album track from \\"Hopes and Fears\\" on here. In comparison, sophomore album \\"Under the Iran Sea\\" get a whopping 7 tracks on here (all 6 UK singles, plus the album track Atlantic). When you listen to these first 12 tracks on here from those 2 albums, it is amazing how strong Keane sounded at that time. A shame they decided to go into a new musical direction afterwards with \\"Perfect Symmetry\\", arguably the band's weakest album to day (and hence only 2 tracks on here: Spiralling; Perfect Symmetry). The 'experimental' 2010 EP \\"Night Train\\" fared no better, frankly (1 track on here, My Shadow). Finally the band seemed to realize that it might not be a bad idea to go back to the 'classic' Keane sound, which they attempted with their most recent album \\"Strangeland\\" (3 tracks on here: Silenced By The Night; Disconnected; Sovereign Light Caf&eacute;).<br /><br />The collection is rounded out by 2 new tracks (Higher Than The Sun; Won't Be Broken), which both sound nice and very much in the same vein as the \\"Strangeland\\" album. I absolutely LOVED Keane in 2004-2007 and saw them in concert a number of times in that period. Given the recent return to the 'classic' Keane sound, there is yet hope for them, although it remains to be seen whether the US is still interested in Keane. Meanwhile, if you are looking for a nice capsule of the band to date, \\"Best of Keane\\" will serve exactly that purpose. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!2004-2007 and saw them in concert a number of times in that period.

0307477479|4.0|I never believed the music-obsessed mantra of my boomer generation that rock and roll could save the world, so I steered clear of this music-themed novel for a long time. And that was a mistake because it's really, really good. I'll leave to others the debate over whether a collection of stories can really be called a novel apart from this: Goon Squad reads like a novel. The central character is Bennie Salazar, a music-obsessed but not much of a musician San Francisco lad who grows up to run big New York record companies and preside over the Apple-induced decline, so the arc of the story covers the boomer lifetime, but the cast includes characters a generation older and younger. The cast is what makes this book, with many different characters given an opportunity to narrate a section or sections of the novel, each with a distinct and compelling voice. The novel moves back and forth in time, and it includes the notorious PowerPoint presentation, none of which I found unsettling or difficult to comprehend. For me, Egan really captured the essence of about 40 years of American life as seen by this boomer, with not a single instance of me recoiling with the exclamation, \\"That's not right.\\" I only have one reservation about Goon Squad: ending the book in the future. That part didn't work for me because, for the most part, I am a relentlessly reality-based reader and her prediction of the future zeitgeist struck me as very unlikely. However, all the rest of it worked and worked really well, making Goon Squad one of the best books I've read in many years.

B000IZ7YK6|2.0|I love film noir.<br />I like many Polanski films.<br />I hate Chinatowm.<br /><br />So why does everyone and their dog love this boring tripe?<br /><br />Perhaps I've seen too much REAL noir or something. I can't put my finger on it, but every scene in this film feels like fake noir.<br /><br />Even the Coen's can do noir, but this film stinks.
B005VQE2LQ|2.0|As a Green Lantern fanatic since I was 8 years old (I gave my wife a power ring on our anniversary), I have been waiting a long time for a movie that realizes this amazing superhero.  I'm still waiting.  Your joking, right?  The villain is an evil rain cloud?  And a geek who wants Green Lantern's girl friend so he turns himself into a hideous monster in order to kill her or get GL's power ring or destroy the earth?  I'm still not sure and I've seen this movie three times in the same hotel.  (Even the porn had a better plot, especially Genital Hospital!)  And that flying exhibition to establish Hal Jordan as an irresponsible but gifted pilot who has bad memories of his father's death is so ripped off from Top Gun.  The producers of that film deserve a really big check along with an apology.  The best scenes are on the planet Oa and the best character is Sinestro -- two great reasons for a sequel that will never be.  Ryan Reynolds is to Green Lantern as a duck is to a Volvo.  They just don't belong on the same bowling team.  This Green Lantern is so far from the comic book superhero I grew up with.  It fills a much needed void.  Bottom line, this movie is a camel cigarette designed by a committee of horses with lung cancer.

B00E25KVLW|5.0|As of today, I have all the books on Rails 4. From the awful 'Jumpstart Rails 4' to the not so bad 'Agile Web Dev with Rails 4'. This one, Ruby on Rails 4.0 Guide, is the best of them. Although you can really see that the author is not a native English speaker, if you are not offended by quirky grammar, his deep knowledge of the framework will make you a great Rails coder. For example, in the chapter on ActiveRecords alone, I learned more about Rails than in any of the other books combined. Strongly recommended read right after you finish the 'getting started' guide on the official Rails site.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|Cute movie, my 6 year old daughter like it. It was nice to have a continuing story to her favorite show.<br />It takes up right where the show ends.<br />We bought it for her birthday and it came out on netflix a week later, oh well she like owning the movie.

B00932AA5G|4.0|Very good, tight movie (even if the there are enough \\"stretch moments\\" in believability), no need for Hollywood here. Intricate plot, good cast and enough well made twists and turns to keep you guessing what would happen next. Strongly shot with enough cynicism to make it fun to watch in spite of the violent moments. Highly recommend it.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|The game is fun, but you have to wait too long between upgrades and for your energy to recharge. I think they are trying to get you to buy upgrades to speed up that game play. Instead, I just deleted the game because I got tired of always waiting.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|Greatly disappointing action movie considering the star power involved.  I patiently waited for a better storyline that never came and better action scenes that were lacking to say the least.  Considering the potential following the first movie the sequel was a huge flop.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Great graffics for a Free App. It's Challenging for a 1st time Tablet Racer. The game gets faster and better cars as u earn cash and prizes. DODGE CHALLENGER is my favorite since I own one.
B0083GQKQG|2.0|Where to begin? This film tries so hard to be interesting, so hard to be moving.  But it just isn't. It is however, at turns confusing and incredibly annoying. I should have gone with my original instinct 20 minutes in to scrap it. But I kept waiting for it to improve. It didn't. The never-ending stream of flashback is so badly done that if the lead actress didn't slightly alter her hairdo, one wouldn't know what was going on.  The film is disjointed, the pacing off-kilter, the lead actress's performance painfully flat, and the story overwrought. It's hard to sympathize with the female protagonist. She is either terribly stupid or mentally ill herself.  The only thing worth seeing is the performance of the male lead - that kid is great. The write-up suggests Kevin is evil? No, just emotionally neglected and abused by a self-centered, cold, not-very-intelligent excuse of a mother. Oh.. and you'll have to mute through the incredibly annoying soundtrack. I'm giving two stars for effort - I've certainly seen worse. But this was a serious waste of time.

B004XDYJRU|1.0|Have a 1st gen Kindle Fire and have used TIRP for almost 2 years with only minor problems. Basically I was more than satisfied. Since the last update, I can't<br />set it down for more than about 5 minutes. If I do, it starts breaking up and then stops playing. I would have given this app a solid 4 stars (5 if there weren't some other problems, but minor) before, but now if you have a KF, I can't recommend it.

1602704562|2.0|This comic portrays the novel Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley, in a simple and graphic way. The short comic summarizes the original novel effectively while conveying the message through computer graphic illustrations. Although this short story lacks originality, it is a suitable read for a brief review of the storyline. The major flaw of the comic is that it fails to point out the main structure of the novel--the story within a story. In Shelley's novel, Captain Walton's journey is the frame of the whole novel. However, the comic misses this whole idea of the parallel link between Walton and Frankenstein's journeys. The comic seems to lack the literary significance of the novel.<br />  Due to the short length of the story it is difficult to follow Victor Frankenstein's extensive journey around the world. In the original novel, Frankenstein travels around Europe going from place to place. The graphics fail to clearly illustrate the various settings and make it difficult to comprehend the different events. As well as the vague settings, the presentation of the Creature in the comic does not correspond with the image of the monster that is depicted on the cover of the comic.<br />  Overall, this short comic would be a very good read for young teens as a foundation to grasp the general idea of the world-known story. The simple, yet grotesque illustrations may be the perfect bedtime story for children on Halloween.

B002GAR3AM|3.0|i love the show so I wouldn't say season six was terrible b/c it still has all the great characters in it. However - the season lacked depth and the story for each character/plot was silly. Yes, Jenny is a crazy character but I think this was a bit extreme.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|really interesting play on various cultural pieces.  Important to know your enemy.  It either avoids conflict leading to a peace or is valuable if conflict remains necessary.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great sequel to the first movie and I like the spin on the characters and the story line. also like seeing spok with a little more emotion. great movie we watched it 3 times in a row in 48 hrs. lol we never do that with any movies except maybe Peter Jackson movies. :)

B000JCSBU0|3.0|I used to love movies like this. Raw, gritty, powerful and honest. The film was creatively put together and well acted, but felt lacking in the script. I would not recommend the film to anyone who's looking for a \\"family film\\" or a feel good movie. The sex scenes will be inappropriate for most anyone so if you are sensitive, get ready to fast forward. Some of the movie also felt drawn out like more should have been happening. Overall I felt it was a great \\"prophetic vision\\" for who we are as \\"potential addicts\\" and a reflection of some of our societal and moral dilemmas. The most unfortunate thing about this film is there is no Savior, rather it is a simple vision of addicts walking down a slippery slope toward a cliff...
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It broke my heart. It's always tough to say good bye to a character, but it felt open ended and I genuinely felt sad at the end.

B00EW9GQR6|4.0|I really thought that Lady Gaga was going to lose her edge after \\"Born This Way.\\" It felt as though she had packed so much into one album that she didn't have anything more to say. When she began hyping up this album, I read things like \\"reverse Warholian expedition,\\" and I still have no idea what that means. I don't think Lady Gaga does either, but I became interested in what she had to offer. This idea of ART & POP was an interesting approach, and when I saw her team up with Abramovic and Koons, I thought she might actually pull it off. Sadly, that's not the case. There's a lot of POP here, but no ART. One sculpture by Koons doesn't cover the whole ART side of this album, nor does anything else she's done so far (in terms of the ART part of this album).    Anyways, I pre ordered the album, and waited anxiously after hearing her three singles. I always thought Applause wasn't the best single, and I still don't understand why it was chosen as the lead single or even included on the album. I say this because of the other songs on the album. The themes here are much more focused, and the album is much more cohesive than BTW. The themes that she covers here are about sex, fashion, and fame.    Cohesive. That's the keyword in my review - it's much tighter album that BTW, and it flows perfectly. Each song is chosen expertly to keep the perfect pace of the album. \\"Aura\\" is the first song, and right away we begin our pop odyssey with a bizarre-sounding song. The second song is \\"Venus\\" which is incredibly bizarre, delicious, and danceable - it has such an infection chorus and heavy dance beats. Those are just the first two songs...    The reason for my 4-star review is simple. Lady Gaga is constantly changing up her style, while keeping her music as POP as possible. It's very different than other pop albums from 2013, and that's quite alright. ARTPOP stands out in a saturated market of factory-produced pop music.    If you enjoy bubblegum pop music, then this is not the right album for you. If you enjoy listening to pop music that breaks out of the norms and formulas of the genre, then pick this album up and listen to it from beginning to end.    Album breakdown (As a POP album - not as some lyrical/music masterpiece)    1. Aura-------------3.5/5  2. Venus-------------4/5  3. G.U.Y.-------------5/5  4. Sexx Dreams-------4/5  5.

However, I say \\"American\\", but reaches the international, global spirit to all outdoor, adventurous souls who have ever taken a first step into nature's abyss and found the ability of nature to surround you with all your fears, happiness, sadness, anger, emptiness, uncertainties, and genuine beauty which can only be seen through nature's mirror. Wonderful story Cheryl Strayed!

B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I love this story, have owned the DVD version for years.  When I read that it was transferred/ remastered to Blu-Ray I took a chance and bought this.  Verdict:  It has been lovingly and carefully restored.  There's visible grain from the original negative (to be expected)but the picture is way clearer and sharper, good dynamic range, DTS 5.1 audio or,if need be, Dolby 2.0 stereo.  This remaster is NOT one of those &#34;slapdash&#34; jobs where the transfer is &#34;merely a Blu-Ray&#34; so they can say that and fleece your wallet.  Also, they have gone back and * carefully * cleared up some of the older effects scenes just enough to keep them &#34;organic&#34; yet not looking cheesy with the modern High Definition TV screens.  What I like about this show is there is enough character development that you can care/be emotionally invested in the characters.  P.S. My favorite scene is the comedic setup for Lhug's tantrum. It's like vaudeville almost in that little scene.  Val Kilmer in coquettish faux-girl voice:  &#34;Uhh...Tempting but...no-o!&#34; (blink blink).    And Lhug of course 2 minutes later:  &#34;Not a Wom-an???  NOT a woman???!!!&#34;  Eeeeyaagyaaaahhh!  : )
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Intriguing story and characters. Written about people in another country but it could be anywhere because the dynamics were universal. I try to let stories unfold, I do not try to jump ahead and figure everything out and when this unfolded I was stunned, I did not see it coming. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys being surprised.

B008Y79IUE|3.0|What a crazy movie, this was...it felt like a bad acid trip or something...all the crazy visual imagery, the drug use, deteriorating infected  arm, lady popping diet pills and going crazy, sexually, demoralizing, deviant behavior... what a mess. But I guess that was the whole point of the story; lives gone horribly wrong because of  decisions made by misguided individuals.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the best book I've read in a long time. Initially I wasn't expecting too much but quickly realized how exceptional this story would be. Page turner, worth the time.  Ready for the next book.
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|The second of the &#34;Robot novels&#34; by the Good Doctor, this is another excellent story, and one of the &#34;foundation pieces&#34; of classic SF (sorry, I just could not resist it!).  Asimov's Foundation trilogy has been awarded as the &#34;best&#34;, but his Robot novels (The Naked Sun along with The Caves of Steel and The Robots of Dawn) are a very close second.
B00000ILBK|3.0|Not one of the great star trek films. I actually bought it because it's one of the forgotten ones (the ones that never get shown on tv). I remember seeing this film in theaters back when it debuted, and remember it being better than it actually is. That being said, it does have good effects, the acting is good, and it has good production values. The real problem here is the story, this movie is fairly short and all of it feels like what would have been a pretty good episode for the series during it's run. It's just too thin to make a movie out of.<br /><br />If you're buying this expecting first contact level of movie, you're going to be disappointed. But if you're buying because you've never seen it -and most likely won't on tv then it's decent. Most likely you're  a star trek nerd, who just has to own it -because trek.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel was well written with gripping story of love, betrayal and psycho behavior. I wavered between love and hate of the character Amy ending with pity and disgust with her and her finally twisted mate. The ending was a unexpected but likely the only way to close it.
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is pretty darn epic! It's pretty simple and a little bit stupid, but I still love it. It's especially good when you get the update! Not cheesy, just awesome. Get it today! It's freeeeeeeee!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As usual, Grisham's plot and characters kept me flipping the pages like a mad woman.  Always a twist and turn to keep the reader interested and wondering how it will end.
B008BM9L72|4.0|This was a very graphic but tasteful book.  It was enjoyable.  It was very refreshing and looking forward to reading more books by this author.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Compared to the last two Angry Bird games/programs I have enjoyed and completed, this one is far more frustrating and confusing.  I play these games/programs to relax not be aggravated.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game is okay. Often it is extremely difficult to complete a room. Takes way too much time and way too many credits. Frustrating is a better title for my review.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|i think this app is very useful especially if u want a camera timer most kindle fires dont have a timer on the camera so this is very useful!!
B009AMANH4|4.0|Enjoyed this DVD...quality was there.  Only complaint....CD's and DVD's...packaged in padded envelopes for shipping have cracked cases...MOST of the time.<br /><br />Movie itself...GREAT
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I had been searching for a new writer and new stories to follow and then I saw that George Martin had recommended this book so of course I bought it without any further research and it was a great decision. Scott Lynch is a very, very good storyteller and so funny. Locke Lamora and his world grabbed me immediately and within very few pages I was hooked.<br />Locke Lamora is a (maybe) six year old little thief whose assigned larcenies have too often got horribly and extremely out of control.  To avoid some seriously fatal consequences that the wrong kind of attention might bring, the gang leader sells Locke to a priest who is leading and grooming his own gang of young thieves. As the gang members leave childhood, so their nefarious activities intensify. While Locke and his accomplices wangle and finagle their way through life, a bigger story is growing in the background.<br />I loved every part of this book and I recommend it and the other two books available so far in the series.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|This release is a welcome addition to the Beatles catalog.  It has great songs and excellent sound quality. Most importantly, it is a fun listen.<br />The Beatles were talented in so many ways, not the least of which was their humor.  This aspect of their personalities shines through on this release.<br />Get this now.  And pick up extra copies as stocking stuffers.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|For some reason this app developer decided to add some kind of points thing.  You earn points for doing dumb things like checking the weather and clicking on other things in the app.  And the app bugs you forever to click on stuff and register so you can use your points on stuff.  Nothing in the app is intuitive anymore.  They have made a complete mess of this application for which all you want to do is check the weather.  It is a colossal waste of space now.  I gave two stars because it seems to give the weather but it's in bad form.  All they want you to do now is click on stuff, register, and get points.  Giving you the weather is like the least of their interest while at the same time the weather is what the customer wants.
B009VYF5E2|4.0|Have enjoyed Merlin on TV.  I have odd work hours...and most of the time I forget to record.  This set has me on the way to catching up.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the novel HATED THE ENDING. I was hoping Amy paid for all of the lives she ruined. Really disappointed with the ending.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This is a truly good album. I can only imagine the pressure successful artists must be under to top their last huge selling album. Their record label obviously wants something that is going to sell. Their fans want something familiar from their favorite artists. The artists themselves want to grow artistically, yet retain sales and relevance. Katy Perry is an artist that comes to mind and she just released her new album \\"Prism\\", which is fantastic. This new album, \\"Artpop\\" from Lady Gaga is also fantastic. It has a different, yet also familiar sound to it. I like that she incorporates new sounds into her dance music and plays with the structure of her songs. There are songs on here that sound completely new and different, and mostly in a good way. If you like dance music you will like this album. The only song I don't care for is \\"Venus\\". Other than that this record rocks!!<br /><br />I wanted to add some thoughts now that I have had a few weeks worth of listening for things to settle in. This album is absolutely brilliant! The first song called \\"Aura\\" is a very in your face electronic dance track. It fits in very well for people who like techno/industrial/electronic. It pushes the boundaries of what a pop star can do with a dance track. Originally I did not like Venus but the song has grown on me quite a bit. The song \\"G.U.Y.\\" will be huge in the gay clubs, it reminds me of a song by the group Book of Love called Boy...not the sound of the song but the lyrics and subject matter. The title track Artpop is a laidback dance track. I personally think it should have been the lead single because it is different sounding, yet very catchy too. Alot of reviews have trashed the song Swine, but I LOVE IT!! It is a very aggressive in your face dance track again. Sounds great at a club. Gypsy is just a nice catchy pop masterpiece which I have a feeling will be the next single. I think there was alot of behind the scenes bickering about what songs to release as singles. My choices for singles would be: 1. Artpop 2. Aura 3. Do what u want 4. Gypsy 5. Dope. The choices so far seem to show the label wanting to go the safe route. As experimental as this record is, I would have been ballsy about the singles but it kind of seems like the label was putting alot of feelers out there as to what would stick as a single. What I enjoy about this record is that it is familiar enough to please gaga fans but is also pretty in your face and aggressive enough to also appeal to electronic/techno/alternative fans. Time will tell how this ends up being accepted. For me it is a solid piece of work.....and let me say that I am not a gaga super fan or anything. I have enjoyed many of her previous singles though, especially Bad Romance.
B00F2HW1YY|5.0|On this album I hear snippets from pieces on their previous album \\"Banks Of Eden\\". Is this because the tracks from these two albums were recorded during the same sessions? I would love to find out. It is not a divergence from the cohesion of this album. You are still listening to a fine work molded into a unique whole. I've listened through this album twice already with no breaks and will do so again a few more times. What I think is missing is the engaging opus that immediately grabs you like 'Numbers' from Banks Of Eden, 'I Am The Sun' from Space Revolver, or 'Garden Of Dreams' from Flower Power. Maybe after a few more listens a song will emerge for me -- one that I'll listen to years from now as I do to the ones I mentioned and others. The longer songs are more of a pastoral, moody and sometimes ominous and unnerving. I found out that the band used some vintage keyboards and amps which definitely helps makes it sound classic and not overproduced or slick.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this is a great game it keeps me busy and not bored  so buy it. its also like a mind game good game if you like a challenge
B004X2M9VY|5.0|My husband and I have watched Dr. Who series for years!  Love the characters and British flicks in general.  The show is so addicting.....try it you might like it!!
B00275EHJG|5.0|good ending to a series of movies that started when i was ten. i loved all three, my kids love all three and have the dolls one set for each child. I understand apparently there may be a fourth movie but i really hope they don't because this was the perfect ending.
B000FC0O7M|5.0|I've read a fair number of books on Apollo specifically.  But I never realized how much problem solving was done on a routine basis by mission control.  This book gives an insight on how much mission control made success or survival possible on every space flight.  The level of training and the personality type required also become evident.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|It is amazing to read a story about how the people from other countries live and they think they have it so good. We are so spoiled in America, we have access to everything we could possibly want and yet, there are people that are not satisfied. In our family, we worked for everything we have and we appreciate it so much more than if it was handed to us. I think this book should be required reading for all students 7th thru 12th grade. Education is so much more than getting a good grade, it is a life lesson.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This app is similar to mystery manor, only better. The hidden object scenes get pretty difficult.  I like how they included other types of puzzle games. The quests are challenging but  not impossible .  I really enjoy this game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A lot of work-up to get to a very mediocre, unsatisfying end.  Eight more words - I do not have any.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|I did enjoy this book however it did not live up to the hype of Jo Nesbo that I have read or heard. I am giving it only 3 stars because I am simply disappointed. It is no better than other mass market crime novels. As for there being suspense well that was ho hum.<br /><br />At some point I will read the next one in the series and I hope it is better than this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book!! This book and the others are hard to put down. I'm not big on reading but this book had me hooked.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I enjoy the dimming feature. Its a cool shade of blue and you can wake to your own music. Recommend this to anyone looking for an alarm
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Eh, its ok though not nearly as good as the Divinci Code or Angels and Demons. Its as if he's trying to hard. What I did find facinating are the other books mentioned in this book as referece material.
B008EKOIN8|4.0|This is a book that can appeal to the cooker and the eate rand the  sci-foodie (did I make up that word).  Pollan looks at the four basic elements of ancient science,  Fire, Water, Air, and Earth.  By looking at cooking methods using each of these elements in order, He describes how each has been used in a variety of ways to enrich our experience in cooking and eating daily &#34; bread:&#34;.  Read and develop a new view of how our food and drink is created.<br /><br />'b
B00D2JDNQ4|1.0|The book had a fascinating buildup with each of the twelve men holding some of the clues.  The end sections of the book were a bit of an anticlimax as everything had already been resolved and it was just about tracing how it happened.  I didn't follow all the astrological bits as I'm not across all that and it seems you didn't really need it although it might have helped understanding the characters just a little but better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. So glad that it was finally made available for Kindle. Guess I'm addicted! Thank You, Thank You!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I suppose as a movie, its fine (if you havent read the book). Though my one star is for the fact that it doesn't go with the book much at all. Its as if the director made a purposeful attempt to insist that the viewer had to read the book to know whats going on, yet at the same time spit in their face for having done so. Characters that didn't exist in the book giving lines that characters that were in the book gave, whats worse the character in the book on screen at the time. For example that random werewolf guy, speaking as Fenrir while Fenrir was standing there. Plus the whole Dumbledore/Grindlewold back story was absolutely critical to the story, yet was left out? Look I get its a movie, and they can't do everything in the book. What I'm upset about is they said they had to make TWO movies to be faithful to the book then went out of their way to not do so.
B00ADQPB50|4.0|I am in a quandary about season two. Season one was an addictively awesome trainwreck. In fact, season one is HAPPY compared to this season. Season Two will mess up your head for a while after you have finished watching it. This might be different if you watched one episode per week but I watched this in two days -- the last episode before I went to bed. Today I am depressed, my stomach hurts and exhausted from poor sleep. Maybe this is what the day after a drug binge would feel like because watching the entire season back to back is definitely an AHS binge which I now know should be watched in good measure. My concern also lies with the writers who are so out there that as a mother, I am worried for them. BUT they are so creatively out there, how can I criticize? This is supposed to be horror, after all.<br /><br />The acting is superb and sucks you in, although I have to say I kept referring to Kit as \\"Tate\\" (from season one). And even though I had to keep saying out loud, \\"THEY ARE ONLY ACTORS. THEY ARE ONLY ACTORS\\" my mind would not wrap around that fact. Ug. I am a basket-case about this. I still don't think I liked it but it certainly grabbed me somehow. Maybe that was the plan all along? (Oh, if you think you will watch something happy to fix the damage in your head...ug, not gonna work. We put on \\"50 First Dates\\" afterwards and nope. Didn't help. Just FYI. Watch this early in the day. You will know what I mean after you see a few episodes.)
B001GZ6QDS|3.0|Don't get me wrong it's still entertaining. Good acting, good story, special effects but i think it could have been done better. The one thing I liked about the original Michael Keaton version is how dark it was. Not like all the violence or killings in this one but the atmosphere the original had. Like the two muggers counting out cash on the roof and the one is nervous about the Bat and didn't feel safe being up there. The new batman just comes off like some guy dressed in a costume when the original the bad guys didn't know what he was and were afraid. None of these bad guys seem nervous about The Bat in this one other than the fact they just don't want to go to jail or lose money. Not to mention this new joker doesn't really even joke or hardly laugh. He has no joke gadgets like flowers that spray acid or giant handguns. He just seemed like your average lunatic but not really even trying to be funny. This one seems to try too hard to be realistic about a guy dressed as bat fighting crime. Don't get me wrong it's still a decent movie and I would recommend adding to your collection but I just think it could have been done a little better.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Love Grisham and love this book.  He is my favorite author and I'm glad I finally went back to read his first novel.
B002CIY8EM|4.0|Good read. A bit confusing at times but so is the subject matter. Overall not bad at all, and for the most part plausible.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala is an inspiration and her story of courage, hope and determination should be read by everyone.  Read it now.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Because I love this movie. I never get tired of watching it. He inspires me that as simple as he is he enjoys life!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love John Grisham and after Sycamore Row I only love him more.  Great book but read A Time to Kill first.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|The movie is perfectly entertaining, however I didn't really appreciate the ending. Now for the not so good, and this has nothing to do with the movie. I can't stand Ultra Violet, just wish it would go away. If I purchase &#34;the rights&#34; to watch a movie, I feel that I should be able to watch it on whatever media I want. More specificaly I want to place it in my itunes, and watch it on my apple products. So with that, I'm not purchasing the combo pack so long as UV insists on being a part of it.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Great acting especially Claire Danes. Suspenseful and colorful with insight into lifestyles in Washington, D.C.'s government workers, wivies and families. Morena is eye candy.
B00AEBB89W|4.0|Overall a very interesting story about this murderer. Who was he and will we ever know? Truth is, if we ever do find out, most of the people that were around at that time will be gone anyway. So who's left to find out. I can say if I were put in the position of cracking the case, I would get extremely fascinated by the changes that have been put in place for forensic evidence. When I really think about what they had to go off of back then I get weirded out that some of the common sense things didn't occur to investigators back then. Like not touching a piece of evidence sent in the mail, or what about taking DNA at the time that the crime scene was fresh. So strange. But I love how this movie chronicles all of that. And I love how when you watch this, you are brought back to that time by the scenery surrounding the characters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is really fun and kind of addicting. If you like Bejeweled Blitz, you'll love this timer free version..
B000000XB9|5.0|This one has all their best hits. Brings back a lot of memories. Some real classics on here. This is definitely the one to buy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've felt as if I were the only person left who hadn't played this.  Now I see why everyone is addicted to it.  It's the perfect combination of fun and mindlessness. You can pick it up easily and set it aside just as easily. Glad I got it.
B0058DRUV6|2.0|I didn't like that the book was trying to create concepts that I've read in so many books by renaming the concepts with his own terminology. I'm sure the book has great findings but poorly set up for application to the real world, with few examples that can apply to small organizations which most ppl are part of. The big fortune 500 executives might like this book.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Wow!  Forgot how much fun this movie was, and watching it in 3D added to the excitement.  Absolutely well done.
B005XLN97M|5.0|my nice can't get enough of this toy!!. I am glad i got it for her birthday and the price was perfect.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|If you had asked me 12 years ago about feminism and the role of women in the workplace, I would have shaken my head and laughed. Having relentlessly pursued an education in the Sciences and pushed myself to exceed expectations in my IT career, I haven't given much thought to feminism.<br /><br />Alas 14 years in corporate America while raising 3 kids has forced me to acknowledge the harsh reality of Sheryl Sandberg's arguments! We women need to consciously pursue leadership opportunities and if none exist create them for ourselves and our fellow women.<br /><br />What follows is my Lean In book review:<br /><br />I picked up the book because I was intrigued by her TED talk and what I have read in the media about her accomplishments at Facebook. Having read this book, I admire her even more, especially her audacity and her tenacity!<br /><br />If you ask any engineer who is dissatisfied with their job (especially anyone who might have chosen a path parallel to mine in IT) they would point to Google as their ideal employer. And they would be right because Sheryl Sandberg started her career at Google and her life has turned out for the better because of it.<br /><br />I am not saying that Sheryl has had an unfair advantage over other brilliant women, just that from the outset she has carved a place for herself in the world of Technology. Her academic background and the choices she has made over the years have allowed her to consciously forged a path towards her current position at Facebook.<br /><br />She has taken risks and chances where others would have played it safe. She has actively sought mentors, used her network at Google to form a Women's leadership forum. She has sought opportunities to lead by example at Google and at Facebook. She has formed partnerships with other women in leadership, and by doing so has set herself up as the quintessential woman leader in corporate America. In this age of social media, she has created a brand that will not be forgotten.<br /><br />No has had to tell me to sit at the table or to not be afraid to speak up. There is no way that someone like me would even be able to pursue my goals without taking those principles to heart at a young age.<br /><br />Indira Gandhi once said:<br /><br />Education is a liberating force, and in our age it is also a democratizing force, cutting across the barriers of caste and class, smoothing out inequalities imposed by birth and other circumstances.<br /><br />To gain access to higher education, it is crucial to sit at the table at a young age.<br /><br />But, what no one told me and I had to learn the hard way is that when you are in the right environment, you will be eager to take risks. You will receive opportunities to sit at the head of the table. Sheryl is proof positive that women need to be picky about the company they keep, they need to seek out a mentor and a manager who can recognize their strengths.<br /><br />I have found women's leadership at the institutions where I was employed lacking. Their messages have not resonated with me. I have found many of these so called leaders to be selfish and arrogant, unwilling to share credit and unrelenting in furthering their own career.<br /><br />From what I have read about Google, Sheryl's message rings true. I believe that she speaks the truth. She allows herself to be vulnerable enough to acknowledge the battles she has faced including those that many of us would rather not divulge - dealing with pregnancy issues while excelling at our jobs and holding our partner accountable for their end of the bargain.<br /><br />I can only imagine what a difference it would have made if I had been fortunate enough to have worked with a leader such as her early in my career! Many of her essential principles resonate with me and they form the foundation of my own mission statement.<br /><br />Of all the chapters in Cheryl's book the one that agitated me the most was \\"to not leave before you leave\\". I don't agree with Sheryl's view on this subject. There are many forces at play during life transitions, they are a time for the reawakening of our inner spirit, our inner artist. I find Sheryl's view highly logical.<br /><br />Instead I advocate that women reach into their creative mind at such times to make the right decision. Sometimes one has to leave before one is ready so that one can start taking baby steps (pun intended) towards greater success and happiness.<br /><br />No doubt she makes a strong case for leaning in. I do not dispute any of her essential mantras for gaining respect and visibility in the corporate environment. But, in all her openness, Sheryl does not address the challenge faced by many women (including myself), which is finding a career that is intellectually, financially and emotionally fulfilling.<br /><br />If problems are indeed prevalent in corporate america, why are we encouraging more women to pursue this path? Why are pushing women through the \\"difficult doors\\" where they are destined to suppress the very strengths that make them a unique segment of our society?<br /><br />As Tina Fey says, the best thing is find other avenues to take charge:<br /><br />So, my unsolicited advice to women in the workplace is this. When faced with sexism, or ageism, or lookism, or even really aggressive Buddhism, ask yourself the following question: \\"Is this person in between me and what I want to do?\\" If the answer is no, ignore it and move on. Your energy is better used doing your work and outpacing people that way. Then, when you're in charge, don't hire the people who were jerky to you.<br /><br />Most of Sheryl's advice is sound which is why I gave this book 4 stars on Amazon. I also appreciate the fact that she engaged a researcher to provide a wealth of information in this book.<br /><br />By all means take Sheryl's advice, but also use this book as a barometer to gauge how close you are to your ideal career. Use this book as a guide Lean In to your talents and dreams.<br /><br />Even if you were to do everything that she suggests would you be any closer to achieving your dreams? Or would they still evade your grasp? Would you still be plagued by ageism or sexism that women face in the workplace? How can you build a career where these \\"isms\\" do not matter?<br /><br />Here are a few pointers her book omits:<br /><br />1) She offers no clue on how to connect the dots in your career. I urge you to gain clarity on your path. Figure out the best way for you to forge your own path.<br />2) If there are many challenges to be surmounted in the corporate world, why not pursue entrepreneurship? Why Lean In to something that doesn't support your way of life? Sheryl leaves a gaping hole on this subject.<br />3) How do you find joy in your work? Seek the company of those who find joy in their own work. Find mentors and peers challenge you to face your fear.<br />4) We should not only lead in the workplace, but also in our communities and our schools. I know that not everyone is able to volunteer. I would have liked to have heard more from her on the subject. If you can't lead in your workplace, lead in your community and lead in your schools. We need to be thinking about planting the seeds for the future generations!<br />5) She doesn't really discuss how to prepare for a career that lasts a lifetime in the current economic and technological climate. My advice is that you view your learning, growth, struggles and triumphs as a part of your perennial act.<br />6) She does talk about assuming power. But remember that interminable power lies in your own hands! Invest in your career by pursuing the right knowledge, skills that hone your talent.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Well written, from different perspectives.  Well worth reading. An inside look at how a facial deformity affects not only the person (in this case a 5th grader boy), but all those around him.  An excellent book for youth readers too!

B00F8KIJ2I|4.0|I don't know how helpful these reviews can be since we all have our own unique musical tastes...you're just going to have to buy the album and listen to it in it's entirety to really know if you like it.  That being said, I know I would buy anything Avril Lavigne puts out. On this offering she tries many different and new things, there really is something for everyone, and I think she succeeds for the most part. It may not be up to the standards she set with \\"Let Go\\" or \\"Under My Skin\\", but I like it a lot.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Great structure to the show. Every episode introduces a new drama. Always has you wondering what's next. Great cast and not too over dramatic. Can't wait to see more.

I watch them on a regular basis when I'm in need of some happy-go-lucky background noise. However, and as a strong lover of Glee it pains me to admit it, but they should have ended this show at season 3. The ending of Season 3 was climatic, breathtaking, and hit you like a ton of bricks. Season 4 seemed awkward and forced. I have always been in awe of the writing on this show and the chemistry between all of the characters. The issues that they dealt with were, though oftentimes controversial, very real and raw. Season 4 felt like I was watching a completely different show. Perhaps my biggest \\"issue\\", if you will, was the advent of all of the new characters. Unique is a strange addition (she made her appearance in Season 3 and I was shocked to find out that she would be a regular in Season 4). Kitty is (to agree with another reviewer) a more unlikeable version of Sue and Santana. Her pithy banter is strange, not borderline dark/funny like in previous seasons. Arty and Tina seem lost. To me, none of the new cast (post season 3) have the type of chemistry and well, acting ability, that the original cast did. It seemed, to me, that the show outgrew itself. I've always pondered the longevity of shows that center themselves around characters in high school. The core is there for 4 years, at the most, and then you're forced with having a barrage of story lines, all the while still trying to make them seem cohesive. While I will always love this show, I, like many others, have had a hard time adjusting to the original group being separated. There were good \\"moments\\" in this season, but nothing like that of seasons 1-3. In all fairness, there were a few episodes that I really enjoyed. Some scenes are hard to watch, knowing the ultimate outcome of Finn's character. With the death of Cory Monteith (Finn), it feels as though the show is on life support with very little chance of surviving (Season 5 is the worst yet). I can't even imagine how they are going to make it through the rest of this season AND still continue into a 6th and final season. You should always finish the race strong, and I fear that Glee missed its opportunity and instead is going to go out dragging itself across the finish line.

0385512058|3.0|I like the key points that the author gives in this book, since it gives us ideas on making connections and standing up as who we are and not who people think we should be. I feel like the author talked too much about his personal life, but the positive side of it was that it sometimes gave a good illustration of the points that he was trying to make in each section and chapter. I'm happy enough that this author has given us ideas on connecting well with people and forming relationships that could change our lives forever. My prayer is not that this book would be everybody's guide to leading a ministry or making disciples, but rather give us ideas and inspiration on making disciples and leading people to Christ through relationships

0316204366|2.0|A series of fascinating vignettes, and some DEEPLY DISTURBING DESCRIPTIONS OF HEINOUS VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN and other helpless people (that made me stop listening to this audiobook for a full chapter), but which in no way come together for any semblance of cohesive thesis. The stories are unrelated if instructive. And thanks to this book, my daughter won't leave the house alone until she is 25. Sickening to include such things without warning. I got the Audible version and it turned out to be less helpful to hear him read it (instead of a voice actor), when I would have thought it would have been better.

B008D19WBQ|5.0|The quality on these blu rays is amazing, details you didn't notice before are there, and because its widescreen, things on the sides are much more noticeable, especially easter eggs.<br /><br />i think we all know they made the blu ray version for tv, they make a lot of money on making friends in hd widescreen, you wouldn't see any of those extra parts on tv anyway. However, yes, all of us are disappointed when comparing it to the dvds, rightfully so, since they didnt put a disclaimer on the blu rays that it was just the tv edits. But to them \\"Friends\\" is the tv version, and the dvd extra lines were just that, extras.<br /><br />I dont think this is something they will fix for a blu ray only re-release.<br /><br />BUT ... they do have to make yet another trip back to the original film to make the 4k versions of friends.<br /><br />Now i know today, 11-12-2013 netflix is barely testing 4k video streaming, and tv providers only have a very minimal selection of 4k channels/videos, but 3-4 years down the road its going to be common enough for companies to start porting over their old shows for playing on netflix, tv stations and selling them on 4k disks (bluray can do this as of today, but only on large capacity disks, $$$).<br /><br />So while we're all disappointed today, and will be for at least 2-3 more years, The technology for this process is just going to get faster and higher quality every year.<br /><br />So a little patience... and possibly some reminder emails to the staff in charge of this stuff, or the nice people that made friends who might have a say in it. And possibly some emails headed towards Netflix, im sure being the only place to get 4k friends for awhile would be a handy ticket for them, if the episodes had all the dialogue, ... i wouldnt hate them if they added in a few extra scenes in this pass either =).<br /><br />FYI nothing would stop them from making a 2nd blu ray set at that point (from the 4k video), and i'd be ok with buying a 2nd blu ray set, but only because i understand what happened. they didnt go back to get us a blu ray set, they went back to get a tv set, and just gave us the option to buy that tv set.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|I bought the book because I'm fascinated by accident chains and complex systems. It's a pretty nerdy pursuit. But Schlosser has done an INCREDIBLE job of weaving personal stories and a gripping, tense tale in and among a larger study of the forces and history that created the potential for that story in the first place. Either half of that equation - the drama of the disaster at the Titan-II launch complex or the more academic review of weapons design, geopolitical calculations, bureaucratic maneuvering, and command-and-control systems - would have been a worthy effort on its own. But the way the author synthesized the two, made each chunk relevant to the other, is just top-notch.<br /><br />Even though I knew the outcome of the events at Damascus, I still found myself rooting for the best possible resolution. I devoured the book in two days, driven by the suspense of Schlosser's retelling and my attachment to the very human characters presented in these pages.
0316056871|3.0|dear (( Tina Fey )) it's so admirable that you wrote this book at all. I certainly respect your writing skills.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|I admit to being a bit of an addict when it comes to user reviews on Amazon. While movie critics often rehash the same old cliches and viewpoints filtered through the pseudo-sophisticated lens of reminding everyone that this is a \\"comic book movie\\", user reviews can get deeper and more interested in the guts of these films and generally treat them with far greater reverence. Why the need to mention this? Simply, \\"Man Of Steel\\" has to be the most dissected film since \\"Watchmen\\" (interesting that both are Zack Snyder films). I cannot remember many other films that have such polarizing responses to them.<br /><br />When it comes to the comic book versions of Superman, I am still scratching the surface. When I visit either the comic shop or Barnes & Noble, it's generally Batman that dominates the shelves. Couple this with Superman being the type of character he has been over the years, the shade of each story arc can vary greatly. While something like \\"Earth One\\" gets to the true essence of the character, there also exists a version where Superman is wearing an apron and doing housework. Overall, the Superman that everyone knows and loves can be quite different.<br /><br />As for the film itself, this is handily my favorite of any live action version of Superman. To me, this is an adult take on the Man Of Steel while still being available for viewing to the kids who are now growing to admire Superman. This reboot is about a stranger in a strange land who is trying to understand how and why he has powers that his peers do not. The entre crux of the story felt like Clark Kent's journey inward to make sense of the person he is on the outside. And like any comic book film worth its weight, it has more than one iconic moment that, if you felt as I did, will leave you with chills.<br /><br />Much has been made of the spectacle that takes place in Act 3 and while I believe some of it to be valid and interesting in it's way, a good amount of it can be thought of us a reimagining of the downtown fight scene of Superman 2 fully realized. When you consider two men who can lift a car over their head with one hand, the idea of them crashing through a building makes more sense. For my money, it felt massive and enjoyable.<br /><br />I have been anxiously awaiting the chance to view \\"Man Of Steel\\" again. Second viewings can sometimes shatter the pedestal of fresh eyes, but it can also cement the esteem you felt the first time. I am betting on the latter.g of the downtown fight scene of Superman 2 fully realized.

0380789035|5.0|After having read the five star reviews from some others and the negative reviews from many, I'm preparing for a library discussion group on the novel this week with interest. I predict that members of the group (most of them senior citizens) will have strong opinions one way or the other, and I'm looking forward to their comments and reactions. As other folks have written, some portions of the text are clich&eacute;d, but that didn't stop me. I chose this text last spring for our discussion group after noting that the ten year anniversary edition had been printed (I had never heard of the text before). The library had access to enough copies for the group members to read, and so I began the journey with Shadow, learning about various cultures and gods along the way. I'll confess that I taught English for over thirty years and had a narrow view of mythology, mostly with those tales from Rome and Greece with an occasional nod to a few of the gods from Norse mythology. My initial reading of the text was slowed, and I found myself wanting at times to put it down and forget it, reading instead less challenging things. There was a time (like one of the reviewers) that I put down Melville's Moby Dick and Twain's Huckleberry Finn for the same reasons, wandering tales with large diversions. However, I rejoined both of those texts more than once over the years finding much to interest me along the way. By the time I had returned to American Gods, and especially through my second reading I found the text more comprehensible and enjoyable. This text led me to look forward to others of Neil Gaiman's work, including Stardust, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, Anansi Boys, the first of the Sandman series graphic novels, and even videos of Amanda Palmer with Neil performing with a sense of humor about life that I find appealing (watch them if you can). Mr. Gaiman's attitude toward his protagonists while letting them be fallible and dim, leads me to hope that he has other novels waiting to be written.to be written.

You buy them with the coins you have but to finish building them you have to ask people for donations of parts. You can choose to buy the parts but you have to have dollars and those are not free just to have enough for what I need to do it would cost me 99 dollars that's crazy. So now I'm just waiting for somebody to give me what I need and I don't know many people on the game. They need to figure out a better idea for this then I would give it a 5 star. I was having fun with it at first until I realized this problem. If you get the game your best bet would be playing through Facebook to get more friends.

1897299214|5.0|Ever since coming across Art Spiegelman's \\"Maus\\" books, I've gained a new respect for the graphic novel.  Many people assume that \\"graphic novel\\" simply means \\"superhero comic book\\" or, more recently, \\"Japanese manga,\\" but more and more writers and artists are showing the world that the graphic novel can be used for more thought-provoking and even literary stories.  Whether it's an unflinching look at a historical event (the aforementioned \\"Maus\\"), a social and cultural commentary (Gene Luen Yang's \\"American Born Chinese\\"), or even an autobiography (David Small's \\"Stitches\\"), graphic novels can do more than entertain and show pretty pictures -- they can be used to great effect to make a point and educate the reader.<br /><br />\\"Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea,\\" is just such a book.  It provides a rare glimpse behind the walls that seclude North Korea from much of the rest of the world, and gives the Western world some insight into this bleak world without dehumanizing its inhabitants.<br /><br />Author Guy Delisle, a Canadian cartoonist, is one of the few Westerners allowed in Korea on a work visa, where he's been assigned to oversee the production of a French cartoon in a North Korean animation studio.  He describes and shows the nearly-empty hotel he lives in for two months, the perpetually half-completed tower across from his own hotel, and the grand monuments to Korea's dictator and his father that seem to dominate every aspect of the country.  His guide and translator (whom he jokingly calls \\"Comrade Guide\\" and \\"Comrade Translator\\") micromanage his every move, limiting his interactions with the locals and even going as far as to remove pictures of street trash from his camera.  Along the way Guy sees North Korea's grand vision of itself and the stark contrast with its lean reality, its hostility toward other nations (including South Korea and the United States), and the way its leaders seem to hold Kim Jong-Un and his father as nearly gods, strong and benevolent leaders quite in contrast with their iron-fisted dictatorship.  Despite the bleak, cold nature of his trip, however, Guy maintains a sense of humor throughout, pointing out social differences and making jokes with his hosts that fly right over their heads.  And he comes away from his journey with a new understanding of this mysterious country... and hopefully, so does the reader.<br /><br />The drawings in this book are simple, highlighting the seeming emptiness of North Korea's streets and the cold nature of the world Guy has found himself in.  They have a scratchy cartoony quality that nonetheless is quite effective in helping to tell the story, and don't make the mistake of falling into the uncanny valley as more realistic comics sometimes do.  Even when the illustrations do fall into the uncanny valley (a state where a picture is just realistic enough to be creepy), it actually helps the book -- the pasted-on smiles of the Koreans, especially in a scene where children are playing songs in honor of their country and leader on accordions, just seem to hammer home how the country strives to be proud of itself despite crumbling inside.<br /><br />Guy's story is fascinating, but it could easily have veered into depressing and even frightening.  And at points it truly is, as he relates how many of the better-educated citizens of Korea know their country is far from the Utopia its leaders claim it to be but pretend otherwise for their own safety... and how North Korea not only considers South Korea and the US its enemies, but plans to act on it eventually.  But he does maintain a sense of humor throughout, even to the point of joking with his guide and translator despite neither of them getting most of said jokes.  He and a fellow Westerner sing the Captain Planet theme song to their oblivious guide, he loans a Korean gentleman a copy of George Orwell's \\"1984\\" (there are a few references to the classic dystopian novel throughout the comic), and when visiting a museum dedicated to the former dictator of Korea it takes all his willpower not to crack up laughing at how over-the-top the display is.  Said humor doesn't detract from the story or its message, but they do help give the reader a break from the chilling world they've found themselves in.<br /><br />\\"Pyongyang\\" is an eye-opening look at a world many of us will never have the chance to see, and while it can be disturbing at times Guy makes the journey interesting and even funny at times.  Don't expect a laugh a minute reading this book, but I do encourage people to give it a look, as it's one of the few first-person accounts of life behind the new Iron Curtain.seum dedicated to the former dictator of Korea it takes all his willpower not to crack up laughing at how over-the-top the display is.

B000OYYSIC|5.0|What a line-up of musicians on this historic recording!<br /><br />Besides John Mayall at the forefront, you get legendary artists like Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, Harvey Mandel, and the great jazz violinist Don \\"Sugarcane\\" Harris. With 18 outstanding songs by Mayall, the album is mostly electric blues/boogie with a tasty helping of jazz and rock mixed in.<br /><br />The original LP like I have has a very nice souvenir booklet with lyrics, artist profiles, and a ton of pictures.  Another reason why albums were a superior music delivery system from the standpoint of added graphics features.<br /><br />But even if you only get the music, you don't need much else.  This sounds like classic material, but with the updated spin that Mayall contributes.  This is an outstanding collection of music for blues lovers.  If you don't especially like the blues then this album might make you rethink that position.  Be surprised and give this one a listen.

They are not from this planet. Anyone else have this feeling!?!?

B00A6I87UQ|1.0|The Kindle version just sucks. They just took low resolution jpegs from the originals and made a Kindle book. The problem being that when you try to enlarge on a tablet instead of nice clean view you get a out of focus or smuggy view. Also being on a tablet it will kill your night vision as it is black stars on a white back ground. You will be better off with the printed version and a red LED light. I asked for a refund and just bought the printed version. The spiral printed version is excellent, buy it instead of the Kindle App. You will be happy that you did.

B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I want to say 3.5 stars.  The pluses in this film as opposed to the 1974 film would be Dicaprio's Gatsby is much better than Redford's.  Decaprio was darker and I think that added an element that Redford's &#34;nicer&#34; Gatsby failed to.  The downside; Mia Farrow will always be Daisy.  (If only there was a way to cast young Mia Farrow opposite of Leonardo...*sigh*)  Toby was a much better Nick than whoever played Nick in the 1974 film.  Tobey just showed the right amount of innocent awe at all that was happening around him than the guy from Law and Order.  The other characters though just seemed very throw-away in this new version though.<br /><br />The party scene was way over the top for what would have been possible at the time but given that this is for a 2011 audience I can let that slide.  But on the other hand it did really bring out the grotesque opulence of gluttony of the time.  Actually I maybe more on the fence on that.<br /><br />It's a good movie but not great and doesn't really live up to all the hype generated at the time of release but it came pretty close.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This unit is a solid performer, worked as advertised. Looking forward to further software updates and increased functionality. Set up was fairly easy but not simple.
B008PEHOJS|2.0|The 1978 version of SUPERMAN  was  by far the best of all the Superman films.It had a superb cast and  there  was  great chemistry between Superman and Lois Lane. In this new version there is almost  none.The  over use of  special effects  left me cold. A more  human story  was needed.Was it really necessary to go back and forward in time with the story  on numerous occasions? Strictly  for action fans only.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|The Croods complete with mini toy what more do you ask for! My little brother who has autism LOVES Belt so this was the best gift package ever.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've heard a lot about Candy Crush from friends and how I should try it. Well I did and now I'm hooked! Super fun game and very challenging. It makes you think before you move and keeps getting harder each level. Got to go now...want to play more Candy Crush!
0811877485|4.0|Cute stickers.  They do come folded & the caterpillar & butterfly are actually folded in half.  I put them between books which seemed to flatten them out well.  They have been on the wall for a year now & are still sticking well.
B003274QH6|5.0|This show got me hooked , a great series and love watching it on Blu-ray with no advertisements. Get it now!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It works well for watching videos, I never get ads or the can't be played message, and when I paid for the downloader $1.99, it worked for getting two videos but then it stopped. They go into the download playlist but they never actually download. The videos just sit there with the progress bar empty. I have the medium sized kindle fire HD and since this is the best YouTube app I can find its alright but I wish it were better, especially since I paid for it.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|New one should come out a lot sooner than 2014. Overall good read, and good author. I'd recommend it as a good read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Classy storytelling. The characters are well developed and true to form, the story progresses logically and there is no violence or sex. This is how media should be.<br />Can't wait for Season 4
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book because it made me laugh and made me sad. he did a great job of portraying such a beautiful story about a touchy subject. it is a love story of no other and you will love this book too.
B008J05EL8|3.0|I cant really see that it does anything on my Kindle Fire...but I could be missing something!<br />It may be my misunderstanding!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game very fast pace. I can't wait to see how well it play. Great graphics and designs . Recommend it highly.
B00FLNRN06|4.0|This was a fun movie and it does exactly what's its suppose to and that's entertain. You get what you pay for with \\"We're The Millers.\\" The overall plot is clich&eacute;, as most comedies are now becoming. (First act, everyone hates each other. Second act, everyone bonds. Third act is the dramatic climax, where everyone's trust is tested. And the last act wraps things up with a happy ending.) However, it's Sudeikis, Aniston, Poulter, and Roberts' chemistry that really makes the movie funny and enjoyable. They're a fake family that bonds and acts like a crass real family and they curse and swear enough to make them believable and funny, at the same time. Yes, the plot is clich&eacute; and predictable, but the overall movie is entertaining, the stars have excellent chemistry together, and it deserves the good rating. I wouldn't even mind see them again in a spiritual sequel. Its just 90 minutes of pure simple American comedy.
B00B04KVMC|5.0|Excellent music throughout the whole album, this is a must get after watching the documentary of the same name.  The songs are all done by great artists.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Game is excellent but I could do without the advertisements each time I start a new game.I Like it and it keeps me busy!
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Of all of the rock acts of late promising new albums that \\"live up to their legacy\\" or 'would fit right in behind _______\\"(fill in the blank with classic rock or metal album of choice)very few actually live up to the hype.This one i am very happy to report actually does!All of the elements of classic Stryper are here.Soaring lead vocals from Michael,pounding drums from Robert the great Stryper harmonies and imo the mvp's of this album are Timothy Gaines for the great bass work and Oz Fox for some great leads that are well thought out and fit each song without a lot of aimless wanking.But none of this would matter if the songs didn't hold up,but they do.All are stand outs!This album,like Van Halen's \\"ADKOT\\" will undoubtedly get plenty of spins in my cd player.Take note KISS,Aerosmith,etc....this is how it's actually done.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE:GREAT WORK!!A CLASSIC! An album for the band and it's fans to be proud of.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This is probably my favorite book of the series because the format of storytelling changes, not perfectly but it was a well enough attempt. Each chapter flips between Tris and Tobias's (Four) perspective. Also the story takes a twist, like a Joss Whedon movie when it goes outside the city. With this twist the story could have gone on with a few more books perhaps but maybe the author was tired of the characters and story so wrapped it up here. Other things I liked about the last book is that the characters are maturing, however, in the end, the thing that makes half the readers unhappy with this book is the concept of change, ultimate love, and sacrifice. None of which Tris or Tobias has yet to experience but yet go through the motions of living. Maybe if they had a younger brother or sister, or maybe after they have their own kids would this concept be more acceptable. Though I didn't find this as bothersome, I think there was ample opportunity to extend the story, but what I felt a little cheated because the ending wraps up too neatly and cleanly, all of a sudden all is well in the world and only sadness and moving on remains and everyone is depressed and sad, the fight is gone. It happened way too fast without much exposition.<br /><br />Some points I agree with from other readers...<br />There is no difference in between Tris and Tobias between chapters, it's difficult to tell them apart, it is all one voice.<br />The ending wraps up too neatly and cleanly.<br />The bigger world was given to us but it could have been bigger and the story longer<br /><br />Overall, a good book but I can think of a few ideas that would have kept the series going in and outside the factions. The characters could have developed further rather than putting them all in a situation that they accept willingly after fighting so hard for their own concept of individuality. And what happened to the Divergent? Why are they not involved as much in the books when in the bigger picture, it's all about them? Where is the crowds and crowds of Divergent that have been hiding? Anyhow... perhaps there's more to come perhaps not but this saga ends here.
0544104404|1.0|So very misleading.  I read it thinking it would offer me ways to help my child succeed, and all it did was give worthless stats and big words for common sense on how to not raise your child.  Fortunately, I borrowed it from my local library so I did not waste any money on it, but I did waste my time on reading it.  Would have enjoyed my time much better if I had read a Danielle Steel novel.  Found out at the very end of the book that the author dropped out of college in his freshman year.  Not someone I am going to get advice from.
006202406X|1.0|This book was disappointing.  I loved the first two.  This one seemed to trade substance for a lot of kissing.  The genetic story made no sense.  The author should have done a little research on genetics so she could weave a more accurate picture, or at least make one up that sounded scientifically informed ala Michael Crichton.  Tris shouldn't have died but I would have accepted it if the rest of the story made any sense.  I thought the series was going to wrap up nicely, after some mortal peril, in a triumph over adversity ending--looking forward to new beginnings.  Nope. What appeared to be a kind of dual heroes' journey ended up in a train wreck.  This can't be what she imagined when she wrote the first book.  I would recommend more careful planning of both plot and tone before she starts a new series.  I am not sure what happened with this book but it wasn't good.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|It kept my interest from start to finish in the book.  It was a story that was hard to put down once I started reading it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a wonderful and fun game.  I enjoy playing when on breaks and anytime I am bored.  Builds concentration
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a fun game good graphics very fun yet addictive I LOVE the scenes and mini games is puzzles
B006LSZECO|2.0|Like many readers who took the time to write a review, I too am feeling reader's remorse. After spending precious time reading what promised to be a good read, I finished the book feeling unsatisfied and to put it simply, annoyed! I wanted to punch someone in the face, thinking about the injustice the ending brings. I won't lie, the writing was impressive, it was witty, easy-to-follow, and I much enjoyed the dual perspective style. However, after experiencing 400+ pages worth of insanity, I was eagerly anticipating an amazing ending (no pun intended). Instead, we get an anticlimactic, WTF, kind of ending.<br /><br />I read somewhere that the author got stuck along the way and the editor helped finished it. And I see what the editor was trying to do... &#34;let's end it this way and get yourself ready to write a sequel, you better not get stuck this time,&#34; the editor probably said. So now, a Gone Girl movie will be released, in the end an actress playing the sociopathic Amy will be cradling her newborn baby in her ams and looking deviously into the camera as the credits start rolling. Then, a second Gone Girl book followed by a movie sequel will be announced thereafter. Hopefully then we'll get the much needed justice & closure to this over-the-top, batshit-crazy, story.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!  However, maybe you should read this to save yourself the money, time, frustration and depression that this book leaves you with.<br /><br />I am not a teen. I am a 40 something-year-old mom who loves to read and get involved and fall in love with the characters in a story.  I loved the first two books in this series.  I thought they were amazing.  I couldn't wait for the third book so I didn't even think about reading the reviews prior to reading it. I WISH I HAD. This series had everything going for it and the third book just should not have ever been written. This book did not have the same intensity or excitement as the previous two.  I found myself over half way through it and was asking myself when the action was going to start. How do you make Tobias a wimp in the last book when he has always shown what a strong character he is. How do you end up killing off Tris and letting all the bad guys stay alive. How do you write 2 books that are so intense and exciting that you just can't put them down and then end up with this last book and have it all fall apart. No suspense. No excitement.  Just depression at the end. Perhaps, if you were tired and just did not have the material to complete the series, you could have just waited.  I know that I would have been more than happy to wait for a better book with a better ending. Because of the way this book ended, I wish I had never started the series.  I have no desire to see the movie.  I will not read anything else by this author. Real life is depressing enough without investing time, money and energy into a book series and then have it shoved in your face. Worse yet, is my 13-year-old daughter, who is not an avid reader but is devouring these books, is determined to see this series through to the end. I hope she doesn't feel like I did when I finished it. From now on, I will never start a series until it is complete and then I will wait and read the reviews.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|When I found the first ten books of wheel of time series at the Salvation Army I was pleased, but didn't know how much I would enjoy them. After I completed the tenth book I was dismayed to discover there were more books!  Lol.  But, I remembered my kindle who saved the day.  Interestingly, the main characters were not as interesting as their surrounding characters.  I was surprised that I loved Matt most of all, and I was rooting for Andol and his red sea sedai. I was also glad Moraine survived. I will boom for any other books related. Thanks for the best continuous reading pleasure I have had in awhile.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|You can't go wrong with a good Disney movie! Item came as described and is in great condition. Great buy!

B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I bought this book because I read an excerpt of it on the New York Times book review. It was one of the worst books I read the whole book reminded me of a brat who allows their whole life to be broadcasted on the web and then complains about the repercussion
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|Fun scifi action flick that is one of the best sequels made in the past decade. This is a great movie
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was alright. Need more rooms though. Can't wait until they put more on. Really makes you think. Hope the next rooms are the same or better.
B000PDYVVG|3.0|Okay read , book drags a bit , Gilbert is a good writer just very self indulgent, not sure I am interested in her other books.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Fun to play, but I wouldn't spend money on the app.  Sometimes the games fail and you lose your game and tokens!
B008LD09LS|4.0|Fun and camera is excellent. Just be careful around buildings because other Wi Fi can interfere. Lots of fun for dad and kids.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|This movie was excellent. It was a perfect origin story for the new generation of super fans. People have written mixed reviews about this. and everyone is entitled to their own opinion but Man of Steel truly does a wonderful job of sticking to the idea that its an origin. The new take on Superman is incredible. this movie is a definite buy for people. I highly recommend it.
0307593312|5.0|I found it quite interesting and I think it has to be my 2nd favorite book that he's ever written, Kafka on the Shore being te first. I think the length of the book got to people. It's over 900 pages but it's good.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I've seen many iffy reviews from critics regarding Lady Gaga's most recent record, ARTPOP. I think they've missed the point of the album. What has become an all too prevalent trend in pop music is creating an album loaded with potential hits and not much else. There's not much to pop albums anymore. Britney's \\"Femme Fatale\\" was a list of songs that had nothing in common but their safe, radio-friendly hooks. Katy Perry enlisted her favorite producers again to produce a boring sequel to her fantastic \\"Teenage Dream\\" with no other purpose than to get in a few more number ones. The list goes on, and while this is not necessarily a bad thing, it gets tiring when you feel as though you're getting nothing from the album.<br /><br />\\"ARTPOP\\" stands out in that it's a cohesive album with an idea, a goal. It sets out to expand GaGa's vision and scope. Not every song sounds as though it was made for top 40 radio (which is also not necessarily a bad thing). More so, they explore the limits of the pop genre. GaGa is undoubtedly pop, but here she infringes on EDM, Rock, and Hip-Hop. And in her notable way, many songs are loaded with double meanings that are often as subtle as her style is unsubtle. \\"G.U.Y.\\" explores notions of gender identity, \\"Sexxx Dreams\\" toys with the idea of a fluid sexuality rather than the rigid binary system, and \\"Fashion!\\" plays on the disconcerting gap between appearances and inner expression.<br /><br />But beyond that, the music itself is far beyond the fare of recent releases as well. There's more to the instrumentation in each song than a four-on-the-floor beat and repetitious chords. There are actual instrumental melodies behind the vocal ones! There are harmonies! Guitar solos! The songs are more than just first-listen catchy. They build with each listen and stick with you long after the final chorus.<br /><br />Some may say that I'm adding meaning where there is none, but I think that's up for interpretation. Like many great novels, the materialis there. It just depends on whether you're willing to consider it or not. It's not a perfect album by any means, and there are some parts that don't quite hit their mark (\\"Swine\\" is not one of my favorites), but as a whole the album is cohesive, beautiful, intricate, and worth the innumerable repeat listens I'm sure it will garner from my shuffle.<br /><br />Download this: \\"Sexxx Dreams\\" \\"Dope\\" \\"G.U.Y.\\"
B007SGM084|5.0|Brilliantly scripted.  Lulls you in slowly and takes you on a wild, delicious and complicated ride.  Introduction to a world not easily known.  5 Stars.
B00DQQSD3Q|5.0|I was 11 when Empire came out.  I read the novel, bought the toys and (like many of my generation) immersed myself in the worlds.  I felt like a kid again revisiting the making of the movie.  The book chronologically covers every step.  From an abandoned screen-play to changes made a month after the premiere.  Great pictures of every stage.  The e-book version even has some extra audio and video clips.

B00F8KIJ2I|4.0|I'm still tepid when it comes to Avril's mid-career shift that found her going from a dark-edge to blonde princess, but as far as albums go, this is the best one since 2004's \\"Under My Skin.\\" While her attitude and reputation as a \\"wannabe brat\\" have caused her popularity to flounder, I've been glad to see Avril reluctant to embrace the synths and house beats of her pop peers. Sure, this eponymous album strays farther away from her former rock image than ever, but it does so with a tongue-in-cheek flare that makes it okay for the most part.<br /><br />And Lavigne is no stranger to a monstrously catchy chorus. \\"Avril Lavigne\\" is strung with tunes that many other contemporary pop artists would love to have (a talent that has always suited the Canadian songwriter), and would probably find more success with because they don't have a tainted name. The album is fun, memorable, and sticks in your head even after the first listen. \\"17\\" and \\"Sippin' On Sunshine\\" beg for sing-a-long status, and \\"Give You What You Like\\" is possibly Lavigne's saddest, most lyrically mature song to date. And she even reveals her affinity for the slightly weird (whether intentionally or not, \\"Hello Kitty\\" made me laugh the first time I listened to it, and \\"Bad Girl\\" is a strange BDSM-rock number more sexually charged than a Britney video).<br /><br />The drawbacks to \\"Avril\\" are significant, however. Lavigne should not be stranger to the fact that her primary audience is young teenagers, which is disconcerting given her copious cigarette references. They're practically in every song. Tying in with theme is the party/alcohol strand so prevalent to the album that it would land any person in a rehab clinic faster than they can say \\"I was champagne, you were Jameson\\" (a sample lyric). Still, if you can get past all that (as I'm sure many can since their popularity is the main reason Avril seems to reference them) and can get over the guilt you feel admitting to anyone that you listen to Avril Lavigne, then the album is definitely worth a purchase and definitely a listen.<br /><br />Download this: \\"17\\" \\"Give You What You Like\\" \\"Sippin' On Sunshine\\"

B000QRIGLC|4.0|Americans \\"should\\" read this book, and I confess making a moral judgement of my fellow citizens --  just as the author does in his autobiographical account from inside the minds of America's warrior elite.  Marcus Lutrell's perspective is that our warriors are fighting for America, but not for America's \\"liberal media,\\" which Lutrell feels too quickly judge warriors for necessary acts of war.  Our warriors are given rules of engagement that often prevent their self defense from an enemy not bound by those same rules.  Here we go again, sending our best to fight and die for us and then not supporting them.  The book helps us see how our warriors can feel that way, again, just as they did when returning home from Vietnam.  We Americans said we would not let it happen again, but apparently we have.  Afghanistan is just as much a quagmire of moral judgement as was Vietnam.<br /><br />But what if we only judge the book for its merits as writing, rather than its probe into morality?  I thought it bogged down in the miserable sands of SEAL training.  But Lutrell's tedious review of Hell Week misery turns out to set the stage for the misery of intense combat where four of our best warriors fight and fall their way down 4,000 feet of a steep rocky mountainside. We see that Hell Week on a Pacific beach gives our guys the required mental toughness, but does not provide the surefooted agility of a Taliban enemy grown up herding goats between cliffs and couliors.  SEALs are more at home under the water than on a mountain.  Our heroes load themselves down like pack mules, but then encounter a light stealthy enemy who uses fellow Taliban for their own pack mules so they aren't as encumbered by arms and munitions.  Luttrell's slog in the cold wet sands of California reveals more than is first apparent to readers stuck in Luttrell's blow-by-blow account of SEAL training.<br /><br />Lutrell's detailed account of family and friends painful waiting for news back on his family's Texas ranch also seems to bog down the story at times.  But stay there for a few minutes and try to remember that kind of support for the family of those missing in action in Vietnam.  Maybe we did learn something from Vietnam.<br /><br />There's a high cost for America's determination to hold the moral high ground in times of war.  War is not moral, so perhaps our expectations are too high.  In Lone Survivor we see the pain of those we put in harm's way and ask them to kill for us while we attempt to hold the moral high ground of public opinion that is fed by the liberal media.  We ask them to do the impossible and they come close.<br /><br />We Americans impose this expectation of holding the moral high ground, so we must love our warriors and forgive occasional imperfections when they are in our service.  And if we want the moral high ground we are also forced to embrace our liberal media, and also forgive their occasional errors.  It is only in this state of dynamic tension between the warrior and the media that it's even possible for us to aspire to some kind of moral high ground.<br /><br />Read our warrior's book.  Know his heart and mind.  Look through his eyes into the eyes of Taliban and understand their hate for us.  We are hiking a long treacherous mountain trail.  Those of us feeling safe in America are part of the problem and part of the solution.  Marcus Lutrell tells us there are few safe places to rest on this journey through combat to moral high ground.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I absolutely loved this story. It kept me in suspense at very turn of the page. I absolutely hated the ending. It was awful...I feel like I read this whole book for a big let down. How disappointing! Now I will never read another Gillian Flynn book for fear that I will have wasted my time for another disappointing ending.

B008JFUPK8|1.0|I don't understand how someone can call this thing \\"plot heavy.\\" This is the movie: It opens with a 20 minute action scene that ends with a planet exploding. It then goes to a burning oil rig action scene which.... culminates in an explosion. Then superman thinks about an action scene of a crashing bus from his youth. Then he's shown as a young adult during an action scene with a tornado blowing up cars. Then the bad guys from the first action scene show up, and they punch each other for two more action scenes that destroy a small town and explode an entire city and then it's over. That's not a plot, that's watching an 8 year old boy playing with toys and calling it a deep story.<br /><br />-Michael Bay
1451626096|2.0|Not up to the usual standard of Philippa Gregory.  I believe that Henry and Elizabeth had a very happy marriage, but this was not evident from this story - it just appears that Henry was insecure on his thrown and ruthless to keep it.  I did not feel that I understood either of them.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I was surprised by how little the Chromecast does. Suddenly, I understand why it's so much less expensive than a Roku box. It can currently only stream from Netflix, Youtube, and Chrome. To be honest the Chrome stream doesn't seem to work well; I've only tried using it a few times, but every time I do, the image on my TV locks up, and stops following my laptop. The Netflix operation works fairly well, but there can be some issues transitioning between episodes, or getting back to controls, if you have to exit the app, and then return to it on your portable device. Youtube works fairly well, though now my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 2) tries to send to the Chromecast, when I turn my phone for full screen mode, even when I'm not trying to send to the Chromecast. Google is promising that Chromecast will support a bunch media apps in the future, but I wonder how long it's going to take.

1455525839|5.0|It's always a thrill when there is a new novel out by Preston and Child.<br />White Fire by Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child is their thirteenth novel featuring FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast. This time the young woman he is mentoring and helping through college, Corrie Swanson, has headed out from John Jay College of Criminal Justice to the Colorado Rockies and the resort town of Roaring Fork. She is hoping to examine the remains of several miners who were reportedly killed  by a man eating bear 150 years ago. The remains from the old cemetery have recently been exhumed in preparation to be moved to a new burial site, so If she can manage to get permission to examine the remains of the miners who were killed by the bear, she can submit her thesis project and paper (a large-scale study of perimortem trauma on human bones inflicted by a large carnivore) to the college for a scholarship.<br /><br />Corrie's plans run amok when permission to examine the remains is denied. She takes matters into her own hands and ends up in jail, which results in Pendergast heading out west to help her. But, before Corrie was arrested, she noticed some suspicious marks on the bones that have her doubting the legendary bear story.  She needs help from Pendergast to have any chance to thoroughly examine some of the remains.  In the meantime an arsonist has hit the resort community and terror is building in the community. Someone is hiding a secret and perhaps they are planning to go to any length to protect it. Or is there something else amiss in this now exclusive ski resort town?<br /><br />Fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes should enjoy this latest novel from Preston and Child. The novel features strong story tie-ins to Oscar Wilde to Arthur Conan Doyle. Corrie bases the idea of her research project on a story Wilde tells Doyle that leads her to Roaring Fork. As usual Pendergast always seems to have a plethora of background knowledge or suspicions that he is not sharing. Corrie is mouthy and impulsive which contrasts nicely with Pendergast's reticent, careful approach. Both are intelligent and insightful.<br /><br />Preston and Child are accomplished writers who know how to tell a story - slowly revealing more information while presenting plenty of plot twists and turns.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book is set in the same town where it all began for John Grisham. Another \\"can't put it down\\" book. You will not be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book kept my attention from start to finish. The author is a great story teller.  There is enough action and suspense throughout. You'll enjoy it!
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Kevin Spacey is awesome!  Enjoyed the story and can't wait until next season.  The suspense and story line made it so you could not stop watching.  I watched the whole season in three days.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much and mainly because it gave you such a great perspective of that era.  What common people went through to earn a living was an eye opener.
0425252868|5.0|This book has to be one of the best that I have ever read about air combat during World War II. But much more than that, it tells the very real and touching story of two men caught up in the terrible war, how their paths quite literally crossed one another in the skies over Europe and then finally met decades later. Both powerful and beautifully written.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Game is very addictive. Don't like how it forces you to spend money to get through levels. Should be some way of earning coins to purchase helpers.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Worst game ever. Not worth the money. I wished I never bought this app. Game sucks crap! Don't buy this game.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies.  Incredible locations (in 24 countries) & photography. Superb use of color.  We rented this first but on seeing it had to own it.
B000S1L7IU|3.0|Usually Cussler\\"s books do not carry such unlikely science fiction premises as this one. The reader must really suspend his/her common sense to enjoy the premises presented in the book.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I thought it was pretty good.  Interesting story line.  Outcome wasn't too predictable.  Good acting and graphics.  I liked the $.99 rental.
B00FJU1HLC|1.0|Don't bother. So. Predicable. Teenagers are much smarter than Dad, a tough guy but portrayed as a fearful idiot until more evolved teens, destined to fall in love, force him to change. Humor is partly about Dad hoping Grandma gets knocked off. Ugh. Yawn. Unimpressive waste of time. We rented because a little friend liked it but should have read reviews first. I imagine this isn't the only review of its kind.
B00AEFZ2DG|1.0|Even if I wasn't a fan of the book, I'd still think this was a bad movie. Unbelievably cheesy action scenes, haphazard and poorly developed plot, lame acting and several obvious continuity screw ups(I counted 4 in the train scene alone. And don't even get me started on the car chase scene). Just very amateurish overall, which is sad because they had a very good base to work off of from the book. Instead they jettisoned 95% of the plot from the book and inserted outlandish plot lines and action scenes.
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|Started with free version...didn't take long to step up to the pro version.<br />Fun and relaxing at the same time. You won't be able to put it down.<br />Love that the number of puzzles is so large. I will be able to play for a very long time.
0316044695|5.0|Totally enjoyed the book; it was a good price; and when I finished it , I passed it on to an ' almost ' Navy Seal!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just awesome, works perfectly in Chile
B0063M22QO|4.0|The game has some unique challenges, matching tiles and seeing if you can increase the speed of solving the puzzles. Worth the investment.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|A fine edition to my DVD collection...Columbo is excellent entertainment for the whole family. The disks are well packaged to last a lifetime with care. My only beef is the limited extras included. It would've been nice to see Peter Falk discussing his work and the many fine actors he starred with in this series. Also, the Spanish language subtitles aren't included for the later episodes.<br /><br />However, the production quality is amazing for 1970's and 1980's...The picture is crisp and clear. And the acting is superb for the era.<br /><br />It's also quite a kick to see the fashion and antiquated technology of the period. It certainly brings back fond memories of when good script writing, drama and suspense--not special effects and car chases--made a show worth watching.<br /><br />In my area, Columbo reruns air only once a week--on Sundays. And some of the later episodes never seem to air at all--which is when they had even bigger budgets and better directing. But now I get to play the same episode--or better--on DVD at the same time and watch it totally commercial free. And as far as I'm concerned that's the only way to see Columbo at work and not skip a beat of his masterful sleuthing. Trust me, you don't want to miss a single flicked cigar ash if you can help it...Especially in today's stiflingly politically correct culture...Also, I notice the network reruns do seem to edit out some scenes and credits to make room for more commercials--which is artistic blasphemy in my book.<br /><br />For the fifty bucks I paid, this is some of the finest television that ever aired. It includes 3 bonus episodes of Mrs. Columbo; which are best avoided if you don't want to see a fine actress like Kate Mulgrew--Captain Janeway of the Star Trek Voyager series--wasting her talents in a role she was little suited for and for which she was laughably young and poorly cast. The idea of a married woman using her feminine charms and know-it-all intellect as an investigative reporterto collar murderers might've worked under any other name...But not in this case...However, it will make you appreciate the real Columbo all the more.<br /><br />This Columbo series now occupies a place of honor alongside my Rumpole of the Bailey collection--which is another fine piece of period TV...I'd recommend it based on price, quality and free shipping as one of the best deals on Amazon....It's just a little short of extra features but that seems a fairly petty complaint hardly worth mentioning.<br /><br />Just a viewer tip: If you watch these in chronological order you get to see Columbo's shoes go from brand spanking new to a God awful mess...He apparently never polished them once during the whole time he was shooting the show--and his raincoat gets ever more rumpled as well.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I can't get over this book!! it's so great I read it in two days! I was so attached.  its 12:29 right now and I just finished it because I had to see the ending  The end is definitely the greatest part  it's funny, very sad, sweet, and I totally find it relating to kids at my school in terms of bullying and jokes, dating and just the ways they talk. It shows the story from all the characters different views without repeating itself super interesting and I literally found myself wanting to be in this book standing up for Auggie and sitting with him, Summer, and Jack at lunch😜  so many of my teachers recommend this book u should definitely buy it soooooo worth it
B004A2V3K0|5.0|This album is so Great with all the wonderful songs that Bon Jovi has ever written and performed.  This is a must own album for people who love Bon Jovi
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|It was ok but i dont see a lot of action ir suspense.  Want to see other characters and other activities occuring.
B008CX2A2I|5.0|The Bluetooth works great in my Onkyo TX-NR717. I have enjoy many hours of Bluetoothing from iPhone 4 and 5. Transmits approximately 30 feet ok. There is a button on the side of unit that was not mentioned in the instruction that enables the unit to be detected the first time. Once I figured that out was off and running. I'am glad I purchased this item and have enjoyed selecting music from the arm chair to listen to. I do recommend this item.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Works as described. Download while doing other things. View when it is convenient. Great for personal videos that are on Youtube.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved the book...it was riveting and kept me interested the whole way through. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good book to read
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This device does not work with Cisco wireless routers.  It took me 11 days, 3 phone calls, and 11 emails with Google support for them to figure out that the product does not work at all with the wireless router I own.  I am returning the product and have chastised Google about their marketing material's false advertising.  Amazon's returns are great though.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|If you're a fan of pop music with a heavy dance and electronic influence, I find it hard to imagine you wouldn't enjoy this album. I love Lady Gaga's past music, but I think ARTPOP is my favorite album of hers as a whole. The songs sound great alone, but together is where they really shine and make for a really fun listening experience. The energy, from start to finish, is like a fantastic rave celebration, with the exception of the song Dope, which is more reminiscent of Speechless from The Fame Monster. I also have to mention Gaga's vocals on ARTPOP are just SICK, she sounds better than ever in many songs here. I've listened to it multiple times at this point and I haven't tired of it yet. Definitely one of the best pop albums of the year. If you love Gaga, you'll love this album.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love this movie !!  Minions have become some of my favorite things !!  I enjoy this movie more every time I see it !
B002ZG99G8|5.0|I liked the Losers because it wasn't all killing and all blood, lots of action with humor thrown in.  Good movie!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Lots of great twists and turns in true Grisham fashion. Couldn't put it down and was sad when it was finished. Will Jake represent again?
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I must buy this movie I love it some comedy was there but the joy of knowing he Loved his wife so much,<br />Was beautiful Wow it touched my spirit.<br />Not for children too much violent.<br />Other than that it made up a good love story.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|Good movie, gives you some unpredictable results, surprises are everywhere and good action. Nice for an evening viewing with not a lot of killing and bad language.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|Like this card. Waited a couple of months before putting up this review, just in case for any manufacturing defect. But it performs as expected. Quiet and cool running. Zero issue. Performance wise, it is more than capable in handling my game inventory(I already known this from my research before the purchase).<br /><br />I usually don't buy into marketing hype,  but this time round Asus's DirectCu cooling solution does works as advertised. Graphics card is one of the major source of noise in a system. I can't stand noise, even while gaming, hence it is an important criterion while buying a card.<br /><br />Got it at $189, with Metro Last Light. Not into  apocalyptic games, sold it off for $20, so the actual outlay is $169. At this price-performance ratio, what more can you ask for?
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Love the movie it about a boy trying to earn respect from his father, and even if he has fears,( Don't we all )  his inner<br />angry pent up emotion of losing his sister because he was afraid .Somehow gave him courage on top of a tree waterfall to tell his Father off And perform his duty.<br />Good 4 you Jaden<br />I really love everything the writers was Excellent. .
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I just started playing it and its mostly just search and find with a few puzzles. Very easy to use.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love the game its super cute and all but sometimes it would freeze up my kindle or just shut it off :/ if you could fix that it would be a great app :)
068987474X|1.0|I didn't order this book.  Once again this is a book I didn't order - perhaps my granddaughter ordered it a long time ago.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Amazing! My favorite album so far. Eminem uses a slight rock and roll twist in some songs, and exemplifies rap in songs like &#34;rap god&#34;, which is one of my favorites. I would highly recommend this album to all eminem fans!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very fun game I play it as much as I do farmville and I play that game alot. It has some awesome graphics to it and it keeps my attention which is very hard to do
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|What a darling, refreshing look at romance!  The Rosie Project is funny, with the socially challenged professor and the seasoned student battling throughout the pages in such an engaging manner.
B00760BPOC|5.0|Enthralling and interesting like all other books of this series!! can not wait to finish this and start Part 2!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Many times a day, I find myself needing a calculator for personal bills or business. This little app is right on target for my needs... and the price is right! How nice not to have to look for a separate device when I need to do a quick calculation and want to be sure that my guesstimates are correct! Love it!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book seemed slow but the last few paragraphs wrapped it up nicely I suppose.  I finished it out of curiosity.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|So glad I waited to binge watch this show. I find myself having a hard time walking away from &#34;just one more&#34; episode!
B003G4W49C|5.0|When I heard that the movie was being made, I had to refresh my memory of this great story. Mandatory high school reading, especially written from this perspective was a quick fun story and beautifully planned. Definitely a must have for my children when they are in their teens.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally addictive &amp; engrossing game. You're not satisfied until you've completed the level you're on which gets harder as you proceed. Just wish friends could gift you free lollipops &amp; such to help you clear levels w/o having to purchase from store all the time<br />.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I loved every second of this thrill ride!!! I want to be Robert Langdon when I grow up! I truly hope Mr. Brown brings him back in more novels.
006224454X|4.0|This is quite a debut novel. There are veteran mystery writers whose first books are garbage compared to this one. However, that being said, this novel is not perfect by any means. The storyline itself is fascinating and moved along quickly, sucking me deeply into the story. I had to know what in the world happened to this woman, Christine! But there are little things that annoyed me, like the author's repetitive descriptions of genitalia. I'm not sure what the point was and I found it a bit....creepy. Also, knowing nothing about the author, about 1/4 of the way into the book, I thought \\"This writer is a man\\". Even though the main character is a woman, there are subtle things that I don't think most women would really do or say. It's a bit hard to explain, but I'm sure there are other women who felt that disconnect with the character of Christine. The ending of the book is slightly predictable, yet still very enjoyable. I don't think it's actually the author's fault that I guessed the ending, since as the old saying goes \\"There is nothing new under the sun\\". Still, I recommend this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is a fun, entertaining, addictive, multi level game.  Each level has a different challenge.  Either you are required to accomplish your goal in so many moves or in a given length of time.

B008X9Z37A|2.0|The corners do not hold up over time and get very loose.  This causes the Kindle to slide out completely out of the case.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Awesome !! One of the scariest movies I've seen in a long time!! 5 stars I would deff recommend it!! Even my adult children thought it was good and they aren't affaid of movies !! Lol
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved the book. It was a great ending to a great series that is definitely one of my favorites. I don't understand why people are getting mad at the way Roth ended the book;I thought the ending was great.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I needed a new gaming mouse and didn't want to spend a lot of money. Saw this deal, but didn't know the brand. Decided to just go for it and try it out. At first when I got the mouse I was worried because it looked cheaply made, but I have been using it for a few weeks now and it's working great. So I'm pretty happy with this mouse. Worth the money I paid for it.
0345803485|5.0|Was so much more then I thought it would be. Had me turned on and absolutely pulsating from start to finish. Am now waiting to read darker and then freed. Should be delivered within the next day or so....can't believe I waited so long to read! Cannot wait for the movie to come out!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Probably one of the finest series to have come out of Great Britain in the last three decades. The acting and  photography are brilliant, and more than compensate for any lulls in the narrative.  Close attention to clothing and props contributes  to the greatness of this series.  If it ends with  the next season, we will have been well-served.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Pants<br />Needs more content<br /><br />And needs more depth to the game a simpler truck routing system as well<br />Would help but overall a ok game
B003QTUQGU|5.0|Okay, let us get this out of the way:  This isn't the story created by Lewis Carroll, and it isn't like the cartoon that Disney put out originally.  I know it is put out by Disney, but it isn't the Alice in Wonderland we are all familiar with.  When you saw the name Tim Burton, this should have been a big clue.<br /><br />The story does use many of the beloved characters from Lewis Carroll's story:  Caterpillar, Cheshire Cat, The Red Queen, Mad Hatter, White Rabbit, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, etc.  However, Tim Burton has created an entirely new story line that is a sequel to the original Alice story.<br /><br />Alice is now grown up, and she has dismissed her memories of Wonderland as a fantastic dream.  While running away from a marriage proposal, she falls down the rabbit hole again.  Convinced she isn't the Alice everyone is looking for, she keeps waiting to wake up.  Meanwhile, she is being hunted by the Red Queen because it is only Alice who can save everyone from the Jabberwocky, which the Red Queen  used to steal the throne from her sister and to maintain control over her subjects.<br /><br />The movie has a bit of a slow start at first, and it may not be embraced by the purists who want the original story.  However, I can appreciate this retelling and new story line.  I am a big Tim Burton fan, at least of his later works.  Though people often criticize him for putting his girlfriend and Johnny Depp in all his movies, I generally enjoy their acting.  I have to admit, this wasn't one of my favorite roles of Depp as the Mad Hatter.  I liked the portrayal of the character, which is shown as being more sensitive...but I don't know if I exactly liked Depp in the role.  He seemed a bit &#34;washed out&#34;.  It was like seeing Jack Sparrow if he had been turned into an artistic nerd.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter, though, was my absolute favorite as the Red Queen.  Though the Red Queen is still awful, there is a bit of a sympathy with her as well.  Personally,I was rooting for her.<br /><br />I also really liked Alan Rickman as the Caterpillar, and I loved the Cheshire cat too!<br /><br />This is kind of a &#34;coming into yourself&#34; type of story.  It was really delightful to see so many talented actors in one movie.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Wonderful book - can hardly wait to start book 3 in this trilogy. Ken Follett is a master of historical fiction!
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|I got say this album a Hodge podge of good and bad lady gaga music. Overall the album is a decent record compared to her last effort yet I miss the lady gaga debut songs they seemed to showcase the best side of her music. Nowadays it seems gaga going for more shock value than quality finished product in her music.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Absolutely one of my favorite movies! Full of dancing and singing. Might not be suitable for younger kids because of the dancing but its a MUST SEE.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Del Toro manages to pull off a tried (and failed) before concept and made a real decent movie. Some years ago, they made a movie similar to this one; Giant Robots Fighting off some Godzilla type monsters...It was really bad. It was so bad I can't even remember the name. But Del Toro took a cast of new faces and pulled off a solid movie with a real interesting plot. In this movie, invasion doesn't come from outer space, but from the deeps of our very own oceans. The computer generated graphics were balanced so well with the acting and on going action that for a minute you almost forget that these awesomely huge machines are not real! It was not just a blur of fake imagery grinding on and on. This was a surprisingly complex movie. Only Guillermo Del Toro could have pulled this one off so well.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I recommend against the Chromecast device.  It is a brilliant idea but a poor application.  The supposed purpose is to view on your TV what you view on your computer.  It is NOT compatible with many internet streams - for example, with Chromecast you cannot stream your own Amazon Instant Video streams on your TV.  Also, it \\"eats up\\" your random access memory and random operating memory (RAM & ROM) such that any projection to your TV is scratchy and jerkish.  It is a wasted $35.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|The way the critics trashed this movie is a real shame. I enjoyed this action packed movie very much. Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds would not at first thought be what you would consider the ideal team up to do a movie, but the circumstances of the film put them together perfectly. This movie cannot be solely put into A Comedy type bracket. There was some serious action going on as two purgatory type cops face off against some really gruesome villains. In this movie, if you die evil, your escorted to your final doom. If your a person that has managed to live without any real evil done in life, your escorted to your final reward. But what if your a basically good person, but have made some bad mistakes? Sound familiar? Well, if THats the case, maybe you can earn a change of direction by being on the R.I.P.D. Team.
B00DSO9RMC|5.0|Vintage Pratchett, with Moist (slightly damp) Von Lipwig at his best.<br />Can't wait for the next one, TP is the best writer of fantasy on earth.<br />And I am a morpokian in my soul
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This app provides many features that the website does not provide, for one, it has better quality than just going onto the Internet. The only downside is that it may take long to sign in and to load a video but other that this app is amazing!
B00FN811SY|5.0|Very useful tool for personal study and research.  I use it on my Windows 8 computer at home, and on my Motorola Droid smartphone while at meetings and in the ministry.  Thank you!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Not entirely unpredictable, it does have a few good twists and turns. If you like John Grisham, you'll probably enjoy this one.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not much of a plot. If you like the sexed out portion of the first one you'll probably like this. I prefer an actual storyline based on more than just sex so wouldn't recommend this to anyone that feels the same way.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|trying to reach levels,you get a couple retry's then you're timed out...sometimes for 20-25 mins....<br />other than that it's fun...

B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Scary, but couldn't stop watching. Just has one of those story lines where you needed to know what happened next. Streamed mine on amazon prime, everytime I told myself, ok this is the last one, I watched another, and another, until I spent my day watching all 12 episodes.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|very clumsy to use and produces really poor washed-out images with hardly any color.  certainly not a good product if you intend to do lots of images.
B00GHJ1S2M|5.0|If you like Gaga, you will like the new album as well. Some songs are crazy, in a good way.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|&#34;Cold Body, Warm Heart&#34; seems a perfectly appropriate description for this movie.  I realize this was probably intended for the teen, zombie-loving market, but I think people of all ages can appreciate and enjoy it.  I'll admit that I decided to watch this movie because the teens that I teach recommended it.  I thought it would probably be silly and all teeny-bopper-y, much below my dignity, but I thought, well, it will give me something to talk to them about.  I was very pleasantly surprised at what a good movie it actually is.<br /><br />It's set in the near future after some strange virus left a good portion of the world's population &#34;undead.&#34;  Naturally, those who have not been infected have sealed themselves away from the others for their own protection.  In this movie, a normal girl has a chance encounter with dangerous zombies, one of whom eats her boyfriend's brain and develops the feelings for the girl that were housed there.  They're drawn together and love prevails over all, of course.<br /><br />Obviously, this would be a great date movie for teens, but it seems a bit more than that, too.  It has a depth of symbolism that is intellectually satisfying as much as it is emotionally satisfying.  It's definitely worth watching if you want to believe in the power of love.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great movie. Marvel is doing a great job putting drawings and story boards on the big screen. Thor is awesome!
B0095R6OBS|5.0|This offbeat spoof of the Frankenstein story has become a classic in my family.  It's something we watch almost every Halloween as a fun way to celebrate, and it never fails to leave us dissolved in laughter and quoting the funniest bits.  The whole concept is fun with a juvenile, modern-day Victor Frankenstein rebuilding and reanimating his beloved dog Sparky.  Every actor is supremely well-suited for his or her role to perfect comic effect.  The artful use of black and white filming, along with all the &#34;scary&#34; imagery makes the mood of this movie delightfully Halloween-y and fun.  We just love this film!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show will get you hooked whether you are planning on it or not. It has a great combination of drama and comedy.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|As a teacher of literature, I'm very familiar with the Great Gatsby as a book and from its earlier film incarnation starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow.  Overall, I was unimpressed with this film version, and in certain moments, I was actually angry with it.  It seemed to me that the screenwriter felt superior to F. Scott Fitzgerald to the point that he felt he had to not only present the story but also explain it.  It felt very &#34;dumbed down&#34; to me.  Since I've read the book a good number of times, I could immediately recognize when a line of narration came directly from the book and when it was added material whose purpose was to manipulate the audience to see the story only in one particular way -- the way the screenwriter sees it.  I felt that the movie took us places that Fitzgerald never intended us to go, especially in its depiction of Nick Caraway as having been severely damaged from his acquaintance with Gatsby.  According to the movie, Nick is now a horrible, bitter alcoholic, in need of constant psychiatric therapy.  Seriously, if this were the case, how could Nick look back at his friend as the &#34;great&#34; Gatsby?<br /><br />Allow me to say one good thing about this movie.  It did have a beautiful look to it.  Visually, it depicted the world of Gatsby to be an airbrushed version of life.  I feel the &#34;look&#34; was consistent with the imagery of the book.<br /><br />Now, having said that, I didn't like the &#34;sound&#34; of the movie.  The Great Gatsby is the defining novel of &#34;The Jazz Age&#34;.  Why, then, was it necessary to supply the movie with music by the Black-Eyed-Peas?  Their music isn't bad, and I can see how it might have been &#34;inspired&#34; by jazz, but it just seemed out of sync with the story.  It was a distraction to me.<br /><br />I don't fault the actors at all.  Each was well-chosen for his or her respective role and skilled at the craft of acting.  I just despised the way the book's wording had been tamperedwith and that the director had a skewed interpretation of the original story.<br /><br />F. Scott Fitzgerald was a great writer.  The Great Gatsby is a great story.  This film did not live up to the same level of greatness.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was sooooo good. I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this book! I really enjoyed it
B00190OHD6|4.0|This was a beautiful story about finding, losing, and finding love again.  All the characters are lovable, and it's easy to settle into the world of their story.  It's well worth watching.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best Soap Opera on TV!  It's so dramatic, characters are unique and well played and it's wonderfully addictive.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this movie.  I wouldn't consider it a classic, but it was well-done and entertaining.
B009GESJH2|3.0|Huge Kid Rock fan but just really not that taken with the album.  I love some of the songs don't really care that much for others.  I would have purchased it no matter what I'm just that kind of fan.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Great show with more focus on the human aspect rather than a zombie horror.  There's enough zombies to make it interesting for the &#34;I'm here for the gore and zombie&#34; people and a focus on the bigger picture of humankind and their interactions.  Great balance.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Interesting concept.  Lots of good diet ideas. Good information on the benefits of fasting. The facts were referenced. I tried it and lost about a pound a week.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant. Grittier and dirtier than Dr. Who (from which it was spun), and somewhat predictable at times, but well played and I love the characters!
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I won't give this a 1 star like multiple other people have. I've been considering buying this series after watching the first two seasons of the show and wtf are they doing??<br /><br />$80 for the kindle set but $28 for the mass paperback set? O.o mind boggles... the pricing is massively messed up
B00ENYCQX8|3.0|Considering that's it's a free app, it's not bad. The brightness control sometimes has a mind of its own. The screen will randomly brighten without input from me. It doesn't get ultra bright; Just one tick above the lowest setting. It's a good (free) app.
B00ES27W7K|3.0|Wow, Ms. Rowling has come a long way from Harry Potter.  Her new \\"adult\\" book has all the dirty talk of policemen and others, some sex, and a most interesting story, to salvage my review.  You can enjoy the book, but be prepared for a totally different kind of characters, plot, and esp. dialog. I don't remember all the details of the book, but my impression is of a very adult, strong language, type of book.  If language does not bother you, then go ahead and enjoy it.
B00457WZEI|4.0|I was surprised to learn that this is a children's  book.  Hearing about the play peaked my interest in reading the book. I thought this was a wonderful book for teen or adult readers.
B00005OLY5|4.0|I love this movie, it is timeless! I originally bought on VHS, then when that became old technology, I bought a DVD copy.  I still watch it from time to time and it never gets old.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|this book not only explains the energy fields and the possibilities of using them, but gives you experiments to do to prove each theory. Amazing!
0770437400|5.0|I read the book before seeing the movie and was glad I did.  In all honesty, the book is much better.  It seems that my imagination offers a substantially more terrifying Zombie Apocalypse than a movie.  Not to put the movie down, but the book offers insights that are only suggested in the film.  It's a good read.
B003B02O3C|5.0|One of Grisham's best books since the beginning of it all. I would highly recommend it if you like his earlier books.
B00112C4EG|5.0|Gave as a gift, the child loved it!  Kind of small, but nicely made.  Product very detailed.  Bought two of them.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of my recent favorites. Great powerful read. Bummed its over, couldn't put it down. Exciting heartfelt and different. Power of example.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so fun. This game is so addictive. This game is very challenging. I absolutely am hooked and really enjoy playing.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Really enjoyed the book. It was an easy read with many moral questions answered about vanity and sin. It certainly make you think about art in a different way.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It can be very addictive. It can also be frustrating, but a whole lot of fun. Have fun with it
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Engaging fun!  Simple 2d effects mean it moves smoothly and plays like an old arcade game.  Not horribly deep, but good for a quick distraction.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Visually spectacular!  I invite you to get lost in the splendor.  Less than 5 minutes into the film, you forget that you are not looking at living breathing things............
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I just can't help but just love lady Gaga!and the new album is just amazing to me!<br />thanks for making my whole family have fun with your music.Each Gaga album is better then the last to me but I love each one.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Very atmospheric....takes you to India and into the live depths of your imagination.  There is life after retirement and a sense of adventure is not age specific!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I love the Jack Ryan series. Tom Clancy was a great writer and is sadly missed now that he has passed on.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Reminds me of my own high school misadventures....way back in the day!  Great show, well written, and hilarious!  Great for teens and adults.
B00D8CSVLW|3.0|Great story but way too long. Fine description of racial issues. Strong charachters, but too many. I missed Grishams elegant way with words and humour.
B00FSBW2L6|4.0|World War II left Germany a country divided, literally and figuratively. Both the people and the country suffered what could fairly be called post traumatic stress. Author Christoph Fischer explores that trauma in \\"The Black Eagle Inn,\\" as he shares the story of one extended Bavarian family.<br /><br />In this saga that covers from 1940 to the 1970s, the family is a metaphor for the nation. The Stockmann-Hinterberger family, which owns a prosperous farm and the Black Eagle Inn, struggles to hold on to the religious, political, and social beliefs of their past even as they are forced by external events and the consequences of their own actions to change. As the members of the family are challenged to consider what holds them together and what tears them apart, readers will see parallel challenges facing the country as a whole.<br /><br />Fischer has woven a wealth of historical detail into this family drama. I lived in Germany during the time this novel is coming to a close, but as a visitor, I did not appreciate the depth of social and political challenges the people were facing. Reading about it now was fascinating.<br /><br />The style of writing, which holds readers at arm's length, often has a documentary feel. While the characters and their stories intrigued me, I can't say I liked these conniving and often vindictive individuals. More often, I felt sad for them. This may be another parallel to the way people felt about Germany after the war. Though I knew the characters by their actions, I also would have enjoyed being able to see the people and locations more clearly. Even so, I look forward to reading the first two books of the trilogy.<br /><br />The Black Eagle Inn is the third novel in Fischer's Three Nations Trilogy, but it's the first one I've read and it stands well on its own.<br /><br />I received a copy of the novel from the author in exchange for an honest review.
B008JFUNHI|5.0|I liked this film and I am glad that I watched it, although it is definitely significantly INFERIOR to the book. Below, more of my impressions, with very limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />As probably everybody already knows, this sci-fi war film is situated in the future, years after a failed alien invasion of the Earth. Fearing that another, even deadlier invasion can take place, humanity created a powerful space fleet and trained hundreds and hundreds of thousands of soldiers and officers. But in order to lead this huge armed forces, it was decided that a new kind of generals and admirals was needed, one able to learn and adapt faster when faced by complex and always varying alien tactics of space fighting. This film tells the story of a very promising recruit, young Andrew Ender Wiggin, who may just be the future war leader of the whole humanity - if only he manages to survive the excruciatingly difficult, increasingly painful and sadistically cruel training in which complex war games play a great role...<br /><br />We learn those things in the first minute of the film and about the rest I will say no more. Young Asa Butterfield who plays Ender is simply AMAZING, as good as he was in \\"Hugo\\". Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley give a great show as his teachers, with Viola Davis and Nonso Anozie supporting them valiantly as respectively war academy main psycholgist and the hulking drill sergeant. Young actresses Hailee Steinfeld and Abigail Breislin play also important roles, those of Petra, Ender's friend in academy and Valentine, Ender's older sister.<br /><br />Now, this film is an adaptation of an archi-classic of Sci-Fi letters, written in 1985 by Orson Scott Card. The book \\"Ender's game\\" made quite a splash when first published and got all the yearly awards a SF book can get and it didn't age at all - in fact it is still a DARN GOOD READ. But I understand that it was not possible to make a big budget Hollywood adaptation without significant changes - and also it was proably not possible to ask the young actors to do on screen some of the things that are done in the book... For that reason, Ender from the film is a quite different character than the one from the book - he is softer, gentler, weaker, more vulnerable and lacks most of the ruthlessness described in the novel. Also, at the very end of the film, his actions are not motivated by pity and mercy as in the book but by guilt and remorse - and THAT is, I believe, the one change that was not necessary and it REALLY hurt this film.<br /><br />For the needs of the film many of topics were also completely abandoned and the whole training was shortened, with especially the number of fascinating war games significantly reduced.<br /><br />Still, I can not find it in my heart to take away one star from the rating, because notwithstanding all the changes the director and the actors made a hell of a job and this film is a very pleasant watch! Excellent actors, great CGI, good action scenes, a tense and dramatic narration, very honest dialogs, all this makes \\"Ender's game\\" a good, solid Sci-Fi film - and there is not so much of them around. I warmly recommend to see it in the cinemas as long as it still play. I certainly will buy the DVD when it is available. Enjoy!sk the young actors to do on screen some of the things that are done in the book...

B0094K1K8I|3.0|I liked it. But there was definitely some very dull moments waiting on things to happen. I watch it for free but wouldn't pay for it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is such a GREAT story teller. Kept me guessing til the end, which is very hard to do.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|It's a classic! Need i say more? So I need more words to fill this in, so hopefully this is enough!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This author never ceases to amaze me with her stories! Ms Picoult weaves a rich full story. Each book is different and keeps you thinking for some time afterward.
B00E6X4GAW|4.0|Good narrative. Transports you to her world in Swat. Provides means to overcome stereotypes. A great story to read about.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|Oh Mother Monster.  How I have loved all of your work since you found mainstream success with Just Dance.  It seemed as though you couldn't make a bad album, but along came ARTPOP.  After hearing \\"Applause\\" for the first time I made a promise to myself that I would buy this album the day it came out.  That is a promise I have since had to break because before I plopped down my hard-earned cash I actually listened to it, and it's not good.  The GaGa-esque tunes of yore are no where to be found on this album, and instead we get tunes that sound either very Madonna-like or like something you would find on the B-side of an album released 12 years ago.  While the lead single, \\"Applause\\" is a much better single than \\"Born This Way,\\" this album can't touch it's predecessor.  Perhaps if Amazon was selling the MP3 album for only 99-cents I would purchase it, otherwise it's a hard sell.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Being a fan of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Band of Brothers\\", I was COMPLETELY enthralled with this miniseries! I've read many books on the Pacific Theatre of War, (including Eugene Sledge's and Robert Leckie's masterpieces). This miniseries was a must-see event fo me!<br />  To me, everything about the series was top-notch! Acting, cinematogaphy, musical score, and historical progression / accuracy was spot on! Battle scenes were graphically brutal, as expected.<br />  I also felt the end of the progam was emotionally powerful. The actor playing Eugene \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge was outstanding. Suffering from acute PTSD, he finally breaks down during the dove hunt with his father. All in all, this is a great miniseries I'm proud to have on BluRay!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book.  From the beginning it tugged at your heartstrings.  The story encompasses  the lives of dear sweet children who meet by chance on a train not knowing where they are headed.  Following the paths  the children are forced to take,  it becomes quite a page turner, hard to put down.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|great free alarm clock. It works very well.<br />I would recommend this for anybody who needs a second alarm clock.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|Thought Channing and Jamie were holding hands on the cover, was expecting something a little more sensual. NOT what I expected. I wish this movie was more of a lover and less of a fighter.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Its the best show ever. Very addicting always leaves me wanting more can't wait to see the next episode.SAMCRO ROCKS!!!!
B009O2XY12|5.0|I used the app to use for downloading free songs on a different app and it works great and I loved it
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is the MASTER not only of horror but he can tell a story like no one else....Great read!
B00FHATBGW|4.0|Another great big fish game. I search for big fish games as most of them are great.<br />I enjoyed storyline and most puzzles. The hints were helpful when I got stuck.<br />I just wish it was a bit longer.<br />A little hard to see some things or would have rated 5 stars.
B005PK553C|5.0|Awesome show! I was a little weary to watch at first, but I was hooked after the first episode! I watched it non stop until I finished it.
B0089LOG02|4.0|An interesting story about orphans in America ... well written and heart warming. Blended between two different generations of orphans who find they have so much in common.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Completely entertaining!! Reminds me of Grease with very good vocals. The cast is wonderful with a lot of energy! The dialogue is contemporary and ver funny! Only wish the language and situations had less references to sex and sexual innuendo.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app. truthfully I am addicted. I wish you had more lives and could earn more helps without paying for them.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The story is interesting but not a fast read.  It doesn't make you want to keep reading. It's one of those books you can come back to at any time instead of a can't wait to see what happens.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Enjoy the beat, each song is different from Pop, techno, to more mellow.  All unique in her Gaga way.  Another hit album for sure. Applause is also a great song, and video. Can't wait till more come on vevo!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Great series overall! I read all of the books within a month! Hooked the whole time! This just sealed the deal!
B00DVZ414C|1.0|It's hardly any wonder that the Coen Brothers lined the Town Hall concert \\"celebrating\\" their forthcoming opus \\"Inside Llewyn Davis\\" - VERY loosely based on Dave Van Ronk's \\"The Mayor of Bleeker Street\\" - with celebrities: the actual soundtrack for the movie is a joke. \\"Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song)\\" done by faux folk artist Marcus Mumford is a saccharin performance of absolutely no consequence. The original version as performed by Van Ronk, Bob Dylan Pete Seeger and so many others, was an emotional, edgy tune. Mumford turned it into a syrupy sleeper. Likewise the rolling yet heartbreaking Tom Paxton tune \\"Last Thing On My Mind\\" is turned into just another piece of pop pablum by Stark Sands and the Punch Brothers. Oscar Issac's \\"Green Green Rocky Road\\" at least vaguely approaches Van Ronk's version, but it too is delivered in a halting, less than convincing performance. The rest of the soundtrack follows suit, but the answer is simple: listen to the movie's covers against the originals and you'll understand why there really ISN'T a new folk music revival. These people just don't get it!
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|This is a real easy to listen to album.  It has a few memorable songs, just not as many as I hoped for.  It has a country sort of pop sound.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Love this album!  Every song is so unique.  Love them all.  It's been on repeat since I purchased it this summer.
B00C7JAAH0|4.0|I liked this album, though not as much as previous ones.  I love the harmony's, I just didn't hear as many, also as on previous albums.  The good thing is Lady A is pretty consistent, and I'll continue to be a fan.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|Lookout is a much better alternative. Truly free and the premium services you never have to pay for to be totally protected
B000M02M2M|2.0|The crayons write very smoothly, and my 3 year old is very happily coloring with them. But we've had them 15 minutes, and 3 are already broken. Two were broken upon arrival and a third broke the first time it was colored with. They are all breaking at the same place on the crayon, where the paper begins at the writing end of the crayon.<br /><br />I would expect more life from $25 crayons.
B00D29CBIU|5.0|The book helps you identify emotional blocks to wealth that you may not even know exist.  I'm finding it very helpful.
B001EBWING|5.0|It's a classic! Maybe the best movie ever made. I never get tired of watching it. One of Bogart's best roles.
B00AW57L96|3.0|I think this book was quite well written and the story moved along okay, but for me the treatment of some catastrophic events was shallow.  I enjoyed that it was set in Sydney and it is nice to read Australian authors.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT Easy to use - runs smooth - use it constantly (great local and comedy channels etc) You wont' be sorry
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I Love this album, i can truly respect an artist that spends genuine time and thought into what they want their sound to be and what the message to be. ARTPOP is a true work of art and i am proud of Gaga for hitting it out of the park yet again.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Great show that is entertaining and different than most of the shows currently on tv.  The acting is good and the main characters are engaging and funny.  The show doesn't flow from episode to episode so you won't be lost if you don't see the previous episode (except for the first).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game. It is very fun and not very hard until it gets really fast and then it gets harder and harder. Everyone over like 5 should get this game.
B000MR1V22|5.0|Very funny, witty. Every character is brilliant. Each episode has meaning and depth. Not for prudish types with limited sense of humor.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it,have had no problems. I give it a 5 STAR.  I ENCOURAGE EVERY ONE TO DOWNLOAD ONE AND ITS FREE.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|Great tunes.  Seriously good voices. The music is great and I cant get enough of this music.  You should get this.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|just wish that it can have the first and second game cause now i have three and four but i cannot wqit until they make more
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is very addicting and fun to play but I wish it either gave you more lives or less time in between to give you more lives.  Hate the bombs.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Bought this used and have been quite happy with the results.  I've completed my first half-distance triathlon - 1.2 mile swim, 57 mile bike and 13.1 mile run - and loved the ability to see how each mile went.  The hear rate monitor I didn't think I'd need, but it has been very handy to know just how hard my heart is working in the bike and run.  It did &#34;fill&#34; the week before the big race - a couple hundred workouts - but I downloaded everything and removed them from the watch and have had no problems since.  My only wish is that the battery would last a bit longer.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Frustrating at times. Not always able to find what I am looking for.  Too many adds for products to buy
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|A Must See true story the highlights a dark part of Australia's history - have the tissues ready it will make you cry
B000RLH2VM|5.0|Unrelenting tension, masterful action scenes, and a terrific ensemble cast make this movie a thriller classic.Don't miss it, or enjoy it all over again even if you have seen it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely adore the movies so I got quite excited when I saw this game. It's like most other building game  but so far  has a lot to do and is really fun too!! Really cute concept of saving all the animals and building families makes it unique
B005HS00NW|5.0|M83 is my favorite artist but aside from that I recognize that he has made some amazing albums before. This double album has 22 tracks of all lengths and electronic sub-genres. Anthony likes to manipulate his music aesthetically. He makes that sound that is just right so that you listen to it and it makes you drift away into space. Then, there is that other side of his music that makes you want to dance. Overall, this is a beautiful piece of work.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|got as the free app of the day, but i would be willing to pay for it. solid performance, reliable connection. sorry about lower case... appstore doesnt play well with my slide out keyboard.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|My new MacBook Pro Retina 15&#34; didn't have a ethernet adapter, and at my work I needed to be able to plug directly into the network and this worked great.<br /><br />I got gigabit ( 1000mbit ) speeds, and never had any issues.<br /><br />It gets a little hot after long periods of usage, but nothing to cause alarm.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|If you are in the market for an alarm clock app and you really don't want to spend and money this is the best that you will get.  The alarms are pleasant and and the graphics are just like a traditional digital clock.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Not much you can say about this thing, it does its just perfectly every time. No moving parts so it should last forever.<br /><br />Only suggestion is possibly getting a dongle to connect it to the old charger so you don't loose it.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|This Mah Jong is fun to play with lots of choices. It is nicely presented, with easy buttons. Thankfully it hasn't frozen or hung up on me yet. However I'm having serious eye strain and I have the benefit of reading glasses - the tiles are so small it is hard to see them so I'll probably try another Mah Jong app.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love the Chromecast!<br /><br />I have several Apple TV's and I can say that this is just as good. Especially for watching Netflix and Youtube. You get the easy UI that you are used to on your phone, and then you just tell it to play on the TV, it makes perfect sense.<br /><br />The only thing Apple TV is better at is Airplay obviously, or presenting something to someone. Other than that, Chromecast takes the cake. Also its way cheaper!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great little product from google! I was'nt expecting much because of the price but I thought why not. It may not be up to everyones standards but if you dont have any other means of streaming media and you happen to have a smartphone and are tired of watching it on a small screen then this will work. Works for android and apple devices although im not a big fan of casting the browser it still needs a bit of work<br />onand your mac or pc. One thing that i dont like but does not effect me giving it 5 stars is that you do need an outlet for the chromecast unless you have an usb input on your tv
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is a wicked game very fun to play great to pass the time good story line very well worth it
B00DWZHTRW|2.0|And I got suckered into buying this blu-ray!  How did I miss it?  A slight of hand?  A misread?  All the good actors.  Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo.  Now you see me.  Out of some dollars for a b.s. movie.  Shucks!
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I am an artist at heart and enjoy all these fascinating pictures everyone uploads so anyone  can witness the figures that enchant them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It was great to be able to download Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle!!!  So happy it was now available. Thank you.
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|i got this from best buy and i'm really excited too have the new boxset i have all the ones on bluray of the dark knight
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Like all of Grisham's stories this is a very good insight of lawyers and their world.  The movie is well done and the actors fit the roles very well.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|It was an okay app and all. Very well set up and it was cool that you could customize, but what it all comes down to is waking you up. On that part it did not deliver. I had it set up and tested it out to make sure it worked, but when i tried it out with my volume on high i could barely here it. I mean, how is it supposed to wake you up if you cant here it? Anyways thats what it all comes down to so it does not work well.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|If you are a fan of REAL Star Trek or REAL Science fiction...<br />you will hate this movie and it's predecessor as much as I did...  =(<br />it's just too fake and \\"cute\\" for me to stomach...  =P<br />but, if you like mindless summer popcorn movies, go for it!  ;-)<br />JJ Abandoning his \\"vision\\" is a GOOD thing!<br />now if we could get a whole new writing / production team,<br />Star Trek could become respectable again..!  =)
B003G4W49C|3.0|A strong sci- fi story about a destined, but reluctant young war hero. A coming of age novel and hero's journey story in one. Well worth a read.
B003M6WERG|5.0|This is a truly funny show with a crazy array of characters.  The interaction between the family members is hilarious.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Meh. Not my favorite of the three. Certainly worth watching, but Tony Stark had gone a bit soft so don't expect the standard arrogant charm from the first two and The Avengers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much and I think you would love it too!!! It's like subway surfers  but better.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Nice layout.  Looks good on the Kindle.  Good way to teach my grand kids the basics.  They have a lot of fun.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|Fun for the whole family! This movie has quickly become a favorite of my two boys as well. They are 12 and 15.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|Total waste of money..... this is what she thinks is art?<br />Sorry  but deleted from my Mp3 and computer....<br />Somebody said it well ART-FLOP<br />Wish I did not have to give it any stars
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a great game no even better but sometimes when I swipe it won't go anywhere  but other than that it is one of the greatest games I've played.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This is the fourth time I have read this book and it just becomes more and more compelling to me!  I am desperate to share this journey with my children-but when my fourth grader figured out the meaning of &#34;release&#34; she was done!
B007WPM7SO|5.0|The acting was amazing … it was a heartbreaking story.  I would watch it over and over.  That is just how wonderfully written and acted the story is.  Superb in all areas - Linda H. Lotti
B00BATKPBE|3.0|It's not up to Dawkins previous books.  Make this the last one on your list.  What's this word requirement?  George.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I Super Duper like this kind of game. Not 5-star because it seems to have a performance issue on my 1GHz phone. For a &#34;that&#34; simple game? Graphics-harder games runs a lot more smooth than this one.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting and well written account of life after death.  I would recommend it highly.  You may not read it for<br />entertainment, but do read it for knowledge.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Are you ready to play a game? Ernest Cline you have a new fan. Job well done and hats off to you.
0307394549|5.0|I had had this edition before and really liked it, but gave it away, so was very glad  to have finally been able to replace it...it's a great book with  good recipes and good other info
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I cant describe how much I love this game.  it keeps me on the edge of my seat and entertained.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that there really were no instructions to advise you that the main goal is to run over the other minions or slap them off the path as you run by them.
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|Pretty much like The Killing except a young boy is killed instead of a girl. Acting good but not as good as the US version. Everyone one is a suspect so you definitely want to watch it to its conclusion. Highly recommend.
B00846REIS|5.0|Like the Crossfire Novels .  I didn't want to put down my kindle .  I read book one in one day
B00B2064IY|2.0|I was really looking forward to something new from Jimi.  Now I know why they didn't publish it while he was alive.  I can't say it was a waste of money, but I don't play it very often.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I hate the new Facebook app for kindle fire it does nit I've been trying to open this app since I updated
B005T87QCI|5.0|I love the game but it's getting boring it needs new upgrades and new robots with crazy features also new arenas
B009YU62H2|4.0|this is one of their 4 best records imo<br />its pretty diverse, its got interesting<br />drumming, nice melodies,<br />some songs are very melodic<br />and others are more riff-based,<br />but all of it is very solid and smart.<br /><br />most rock and or music fans<br />should love it :)
B008Y7J91M|4.0|entertaining but not too heavy - great scenery and acting - pleasant without being too heavy - great to veg out to
B0046179EO|4.0|love it..lots of good harmonies,<br />the type of psych rock isms i love,<br />early power pop leanings,<br />a good assortment of sounds<br />and genres appropriated.<br /><br />great production, great musicality.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great device that has the potential of getting an extra star. The thing that is lacking right now is that the platform needs to be opened up to third party applications.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Great insight and interesting read<br />Love learning new theories<br />Thank you I will continue to read<br />Nice way to view things

B001EC2ISA|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.It keeps getting funnier every time I see it. Go ahead, make my millenium!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Continues to be an intelligent series, even if you consider the plot to be far-fetched.  Case-study of how &#34;normal&#34; people respond to desperate circumstances.  Quite creative, and after 3 seasons doesn't seem to be losing its edge!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is the second time I read this book.  It is so good that I enjoyed it  even better then the first time I read it.  I kept me interested all the way.  I love it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Typing for nineteen words to be done to move on with this very long sentence so I can move forward
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle for android and iPad is great.  We have several tablets in our house from iPad's to androids.  I love the cross platform ability to share books between different devices.  It's very easy.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I can relate to the author. Her honesty is refreshing and the cartoon drawings add laughter to what would otherwise just be depressing!
B00FHATBGW|3.0|Just like Partha on November 10th, the game was fine until I unlocked it. I would be in the middle of a hidden object scene and...boom...game closed! I would have to restart the game and re-do the scene. Also, I was bored with the game play so used hint...a lot. I have played the new Treasure Seekers 3 times already but couldn't wait to finish this game. Also, there is no zoom on the mini games and a few times my fingers were too big to complete the mini game without making a mistake which causes you to have to reset &amp; start it over. Not that big of a deal though. Don't completely pass over this game, however. You might like it so at least try the free part. Maybe you will have better luck with keeping it running too. The unlock is $2.99 &amp; I play on a kindle fire hd 7&quot;.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad this is available for my Kindle Fire now!  I've played a lot of levels on my iPod, but have been stuck for a long time, so now I can start over on my kindle.  This is probably my favorite time-wasting game.  I like that I can just play a quick game if that's all I have time for.  I have never spent any money on this game.  You can get pretty far just by playing the quests between levels, you just have to be patient since you have to wait 24 hours between quests.  I don't mind having only 5 lives also, that keeps me from spending all day trying to pass a hard level.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|hunting game with cool guns, a good assortment of environments and animals to explore. Very cool game. Allows the player to experience hunting land game and birds. really neat.
0385738781|5.0|This is the type of book my son loves.  He really enjoyed it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|So,so sorry for this book to end. I have read many books about this time period in history but this perspective to be is so touching and thought provoking; I almost don't want  to see the movie for fear it will break the spell it has cast over me.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved it.  I can't wait to see Matthew play the role again.  Way to go Mr. Grisham!  Looking forward to the next one.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|If I had to describe this album in one word, it would be \\"cacophonous.\\" The music is actually unpleasant to listen to. It is muddy, jarring, loud, noisy. I must conclude that Lady Gaga has poor taste and a tin ear. Her musical talent is vastly overpraised. And why was this album given the pretentious title of \\"ARTPOP\\"? There is nothing avant-garde, experimental, or \\"arty\\" about it. There is a huge disconnect between Lady Gaga's pseudo-artistic ambitions and the actual work she produces. It doesn't surprise me that she chose Jeff Koons, that tasteless and talentless fraud, to collaborate with on the album packaging.<br />My primary issue with Lady Gaga is that, despite the claims that she is a unique and original figure in pop music, virtually everything she produces has been done before.  Musically, there is hardly anything on this entire album that I haven't heard before. She takes the tired, post-modernist tactic of taking earlier, superior work and making a garbled, incoherent, and (dare I say) reductive mishmash of sound.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Very well acted.  We are enjoying this so much and NO COMMERCIALS!  We cannot figure out why we waited so long to watch it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie.  Graphic- not for little kids.  Little language and enuendo.  Excited about the new movie coming out.  Now is a good time to see this one.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Every thing I expected it to be. Installed and available for immediate use. The more I use it, the better I like it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game it's awesome if anyone plays this game they will like it and keep playing more and more.
B004EI924E|4.0|Good condition love this movie funny entertaining fun to watch alone or with a group with pop corn. I would recommend this to you
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Some reviewers don't understand genre- they give movies like this a low rating because it doesn't have a human element in the plot on par with say, &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;. On the other hand, movies like &#34;Transformers&#34; are all eye candy but have little plot at all and can be unbearable.<br /><br />Pacific Rim has all the eye candy (monsters and robots beating the living #$%^$%# out of each other) while having enough plot to glue it all together nicely, unlike Transformers.<br /><br />I think it is a good balance- I hope they make a sequel.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|It always takes me 3-5 listens to really get an Arcade Fire album. I've been listening to this one every day since I bought it and I think I'd have to say this is now my favorite of their albums. Disc 2 is especially great as each track leads perfectly into the next one and I love how Arcade has done something different with every album while still retaining their original awesomeness
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I got hooked on this game. I loved the mystery ,and every puzzle big fish threw at me. I was very pleased with this game.  I can not wait for part two of this game, I will get it right away.
B000FC130E|5.0|Neil gaiman has a unique talent to take his readers to another universe where our rules l as and logic no longer apply. This book is breathtaking for those who like extraordinary fictions. Great reading! Thank you Neil, i can't wait to start your next book!

B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Awesome bubble game. Easy, fun, no stress, a great game for relaxing entertainment. I would recommend this game for players of all ages.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|For a free game it's very fun and replable. I could spend an hour or two on this game worthy of the download.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app,I was going to purchase a new alarm clock,but now I don't have to..this is the best $. 99 I have spent .it has an alarm shows the time and the weather, beautiful.

B004SD5GZ4|4.0|works almost as well as it does on my PC.  Main difficulty is controlled highlighting of parts of article, but i wouldn't discount operator error.
B00902AKK4|3.0|Started OK, then I became stuck on a level. Cute graphics, catchy music, though. It was fun for awhile. May delete it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett has always been one of my favorite authors when it comes to the historical novel.  His characters have depth; his stories always draw me in; and his historical and political perspective is thought provoking, and is certainly believable.  I am looking forward to reading the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's the game I love to hate. I uninstalled it at Facebook, as it was driving me crazy, but put it on my Kindle Fire. So far, it's keeping me entertained.

B008JFUPK8|1.0|Note: I am rating ONLY the Digital Copy.<br /><br />When I order a combo pack, I expect to receive a Blu Ray, a DVD, and a digital copy that is usable. For 99% of us, that means an iTunes code, so the digital copy of the movie that we purchase is stored with the other movies we've paid for.<br /><br />Here, the consumer is provided only with some bizarre UltraViolet / Flixter code, which not only requires you to sign up for two separate accounts, but also requires precludes the consumer from using the digital copy of the movie in any reasonable manner.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO CONVENIENTLY USE THE DIGITAL COPY ON YOUR iPAD or iPHONE; IT IS COMPLETELY INCOMPATIBLE WITH iTUNES.<br /><br />UltraViolet/Flixter is a scam. Shame on you, Warner Brothers.<br /><br />EDIT (11/13/2013 at 10:03am EST): I want to clarify the whole \\"not being available on iTunes doesn't make something worthless\\" series of comments.<br /><br />To be clear, this isn't my primary concern or complaint. For personal reasons, I want access to this movie on iTines because I've built a legitimate iTunes movie library and have invested in AppleTVs and other Apple stuff on which to enjoy my library. Because of the artificial limitation in digital content imposed by Warner Brothers, I can't watch this movie that way. This movie isn't part of my organized library, and as this fragmentation continues, instead of going to one place (iTunes) to enjoy the movies I've *purchased*, I'll have to remember which proprietary service has which movie. I don't want to have to remember that. When I buy a movie, I don't want to be told how/when/where to watch it. I don't care about whether or not UV is easier, better, or whether I'm a total Apple fan-boy or not (I totally am). The flaws and defects in iTunes are a discussion for a different time.<br /><br />I'm just so incredibly sick of bring manipulated and disrespected by companies like Warner Brothers. I bought this movie, with real money. Why shouldn't I be able to watch it wherever and however I want? I spent years and many dollars dealing with format wars (Beta v. VHS; HD-DVD v. BluRay; BluRay v. 3D), buying new editions, buying extended editions, buying platinum editions, and the like, and after all of that, I'm then told I'm a criminal if I rip a digital copies of a DVD's that I purchased for my own use. Now, even when I spend good money to purchase a movie legitimately, I am artificially limited to a \\"new, special service(!)\\" like UV. It's aggravating to spend good money on a movie that I can't watch the way I want to watch. They don't offer an iTunes digital code... Even if I paid extra. Why? Who knows, but the answer likely has NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with bettering my experience as a consumer.<br /><br />I don't want to be steered to creating a second, separate digital movie library, and then a third, and a fourth, and a fifth, etc... when *they* decide that UV is no longer profitable enough. I don't need a different service because I'm happy with my iTunes library. But it doesn't matter that I like iTunes. What matters is that I have purchased a movie and I shouldn't be limited in the manner in which I enjoy the movie that I've just purchased.<br /><br />What I'm mostly trying to say here is that as consumers, we need to be shown a little more respect when we spend our money.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This works seamlessly with my android tablet, smart phone and laptop to stream Netflix to my TV.<br /><br />Any of these devices works as a remote to choose the video, start, pause and stop. There are no controls on the Chromecast itself, so your phone, tablet or laptop is needed. All you need to do is plug the Chromecast into an hdmi outlet in your tv and the included usb from the Chromecast into the usb outlet on your tv to power it. Then, you download the app, enter the password for your wifi/modem and you're good to go. The Chromecast gets the signal directly from your wifi/modem, so if your tablet or phone is slow, that doesn't affect the tv signal.<br /><br />With Netflix, from the laptop, you can sign in as any one of five users with programming/homescreen unique to that user. On android, Netflix only allows you to watch videos as the primary user. For example, my daughter is the primary user on our Netflix account. Her 4 year old daughter watches a lot of children's content on her Mom's android. When I use my android phone or tablet to watch Netflix, I need to search or sort through all the children's shows displayed on the main screen that are there because Netflix has determined that the user likes those best. If I go in as &#34;myself&#34; on the laptop, the shows displayed there are shows that I'd most likely be interested in, based on my previously watched shows.<br /><br />When used with your laptop, you can show anything on your tv screen that you can pull up through Google Chrome browser (anything on the internet). I haven't played with that so much. I use it for streaming Netflix. I've also seen that I can stream YouTube videos. There are one or two more services listed that Chromecast streams. Using Chrome browser, there are more movie channels you can stream as well. I've never used Roku, etc., so can't compare.<br /><br />For $35, it works seamlessly. You can't go wrong.

B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book did not disappoint!<br />I've been transitioning into a minimalist lifestyle for well over a year now and it is books such as these that I seek out for encouragement, opinions, suggestions and just a plain kick in the pants to get me back in the groove. This will be a frequent read for me most definitely. I can read this and see my own progress in her story and its exciting to almost foresee where I will be if I just keep heading in the right direction-free!
B00FXEL00W|5.0|From butterflies in my stomach to heart flutters in my chest.  This story captivated me from the very start.  The author brought the two main characters right off the page and into 3D.  Each scene lived and breathed as the movie reel played in my mind.  I was never more entranced by the story and the characters as I was with this book.<br /><br />It is a heart-warming tale of yearning love and the urgency of two women in love.
B000UAE7RW|5.0|\\"CHINATOWN\\" has been lauded as a 'classic' since it was first released in movie theatres. The telling of the rather dark story holds up very well and I agree with all the favorable comments made here.  As a side note: It always amuses me when I see Jack Nicholson, the leading character, appearing in a great portion of the film with a bandage on his nose!  Only Jack could get away with that.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This was a great story line using the venue of science, botanical. the sacrifice for the love of science. And the quest of the character questioning science and human nature.

B00EW9GQR6|4.0|My first review of Gaga's latest album was a bit dismissive, but since I've come to really enjoy it, I felt that a re-write was in order. It seems that many critics have been quick to dismiss ARTPOP as well. What gives? Well, let's focus on its music, and then on its image. Both are a bit more polarizing than what we got on The Fame.<br /><br />1) art-*POP*:<br /><br /> Is this a pop album? Well, it depends on what you mean. If to be pop is to be accessible and effortlessly enjoyable, then perhaps not. ARTPOP takes some effort to appreciate. My first reaction was exhaustion, due to the overwhelming cacophony of sounds and styles here. But a little patience reveals some really infectious tunes, and surprisingly varied production. Of course, as weird as people make Gaga out to be, she's never really been that strange, and her trademark style is firmly rooted in the sounds of various conventional pop sounds of the past: Madonna, Ace of Base, Kylie Minogue, etc.<br /><br />What makes this album a bit kookier than the rest is its blenderized, \\"everything-as-well-as-the-kitchen-sink\\" approach to those various pop sounds. On \\"Venus,\\" you get ABBA, Cher, Michael Jackson, and the B-52's--all in one gonzo track. You get a bonafide trap banger complete with guest spots by T.I and Twista (Jewels N Drugs) sandwiched between a sexy club track (Sexxx Dreams) and Joan Jett-style pop rock (MANiCURE). You get sleek disco new wave a la the Human League (Artpop) right before a hard driving stomper with outrageous vocals (Swine). You get a catchy Madonna piano line with icy Bowie vocals (Fashion) and a piano ballad that sounds like Regina Spektor covering Meatloaf (Dope). And of course you get some friendlier Radio Gaga tunes like Applause and Do What You Want.<br /><br />As I mentioned, all of this can be a bit much to take at first, and my original assessment was that Gaga had lost it. Well...maybe it's true; maybe she has finally lost it, but I now think it's a great thing. It's true that she seems a bit too obsessed with her drugs, and she's as solipsistic as ever, but damn if she isn't having a lot of fun on this album! This is the campiest Gaga has ever been, and that's a good thing. While I still wouldn't quite call her lyrics or song titles \\"clever,\\" they're usually at least playful.  Her vocals have a lot of personality, ranging from Nina Hagen-like contortions to sweet and slinky coos to belted out anthem choruses that would make Cher proud. This is probably the weirdest that we'll ever see Gaga get (which, to be honest, is still nothing compared to Bjork or The Knife), so it's a shame that this is the moment that people seem to be sick of her.<br /><br />Part of this is the lack of a huge radio moment like Bad Romance or even Born This Way. But I think most of it is due to its \\"packaging.\\"<br /><br />2) *ART*-pop:<br /><br />Is this \\"ART?\\" A reverse Warholian experiment? There's an old chestnut that postmodernist pioneers like Andy Warhol effectively killed the notion of high art, rendering anything and everything as worthy of aesthetic exultation. That's an exaggeration, but at least it helps me answer this second question. Yes, ARTPOP is art, in the same way that all self-referential pop music is art. Warhol's ideas were radical in the 60's, edgy to reference in the 70's, amusing in the 80's, tired in the 90's, and now just completely pointless because it's Everywhere! Making your music primarily focused on sex, identity, and celebrity is now de rigeur; everyone does it, including Miley Cyrus! So Gaga continuing to beat this dead horse here is doing her reputation no favors. It's this constant sell of herself as a \\"serious artiste\\" that's killing Gaga's good faith with critics and casual listeners. I welcome cultural commentaries, and I hope she gets even more provocative, but just...lose the Warhol meta-celebrity stuff. It's beyond old news.<br /><br />Still, if you ignore this conceptual packaging and just enjoy the songs on here, you'll come around to ARTPOP. There's a lot here to like. I'd trim a song or two just to make for a less demanding listening experience, but that's true for most albums these days. I tried my best to hate this one, but Gaga's charms broke down my defenses. And for that, I will definitely give her applause.ou'll come around to ARTPOP. There's a lot here to like.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|I would give this 5 stars if it weren't for all of the information about their apparent cooperation with the NSA. If there was an alternative that was as clutter free as Facebook (used to be) I would switch. Apparently there isn't a viable alternative yet. I do enjoy the ability to keep up with friends and all that goes along with it, but at the same time the shift in demographics means that there is a lot of ignorance and hate being publicly broadcast that used to be relegated to the foxnews user's comments section.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great read.  I did not finish all of the experiements, but the ones that I did do, I got responses for them.  My cousin and I have shared our experiences on the responses that we both had and they are enlightening.  The very first experiment I got a response back in an hour and a half!  The volkswagon experiment took approx 30 minutes before I saw the color I manifested, but when I did i saw two at the same time, and then afterwards all I did see was the color green!  Check the book out, if you really want to see spirituality in action in your life get this book!
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|Quality is good, feels firm. Love the fact I can show off the gold colour on the back. Love the free screen protector in the package. The designs for the back is useless to me. The colour of the sides is a bit darker than in the pics. Doesn't really bother me tho.

Nicely done movie on an interesting theme.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|What I like about this book is, not only does it tell the story of Shin Dong-Hyuk's childhood and the circumstances of his escape, but also the social issues related to having grown up in a North Korean labor camp and now, post-escape, having to live the way the rest if the world does, which I feel is an important issue that needs to be brought up. Overall, a fantastic read for those interested in learning more about North Korea!

B00F031XPS|3.0|This show was a fine production , on a par with anything so far done, but still misses the major untold story that explained why Hendrix was so central to the American Experience. It was his aboriginal (Cherokee) ancestry that accounted for his naturalism, which , far more than drugs or psychadelia, explained his sonic innovations and the extraordinarily fresh perspective he brought to all of contemporary music. That is why the most perfect synthesis of American popular music up to that point was probably Jimi Hendrix.  Had someone like Charles Schaar Murray been hired as a consultant, this point might not have been missed.<br /><br />[...]

B00EW9GQR6|1.0|Wow, just wow.  What happened here??  Most of these songs are straight up about sex.  Which wouldn't be bad if they had decent melodies or were memorable.  And every picture in the CD is Lady Gaga nude.  Why?  With her talent this isn't really necessary.  Applause is the best song here, and nothing else even comes close.  I have loved all her previous CD's and songs.......without exception.  I was expecting so much more.  She had such a talent for cranking out superb pop songs with killer hooks, one after the other, and now......this??  It's like she's gone off the deep end.  Instead of showcasing her skills it's like she's obsessed with this one topic and the result sounds cheap and boring.  I want to add, while listening to this, i'm struck by the blatant vulgarity of these songs.  One after the other.  I know she's out there and controversial, but can we see some class?  Not every fan is a horny teenager.  Time to grow up!  Such a disappointment.  She has too much talent to go down this road but here she is.  Sad.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I turned to this book after it was recommended by a motivational speaker.  I was interested particularly in how social and other environmental factors impact our children.  So far I am not disappointed.  Although I am not done, I think this is a great read for everyone, not just parents.  This looks at a whole host of factors has helped me understand more how what I do impacts my child.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|**This review covers both the movie and the actual Man of Steel Collector's Edition Bluray Combo Pack. If you are only interested in my review of the actual Man of Steel Collector's Edition Combo Pack and not the movie itself, you can skip to the bottom.**<br /><br />Personally, I can't stand critics. Screw 'em! If you are a fan of movies, you owe it to yourself to see Man of Steel!<br /><br />Granted I am a huge fan of Superman, but Man of Steel may very well be the best movie I have ever seen! Considering movies like Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight\\", Peter Jackson's third installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, \\"Return of the King\\" and Whedon's \\"The Avengers\\" top that list, that's saying a ton! As you can likely tell, I'm an enormous fan of the action/sci-fi/fantasy genre, so your mileage may vary (meaning if those movies don't strike your fancy, you may want to look elsewhere).<br /><br />What Zack Snyder has done with this film is \\"genius\\"! This is such a grand movie, yet nothing feels forced or exaggerated. Everything is given to you in exactly the right dosage. You aren't force-fed action like in other summer blockbusters. In Man of Steel, the action feels natural as if it is part of a story being told. Imagine that!<br /><br />The origin story is there, but it isn't too much that it bores you to tears and Snyder goes about it all in precisely the right manner - through flashbacks. This way, you get the gist of how Clark came to be the man he is, without the movie needing to be longer than it has to.<br /><br />All the actors/actresses do a fantastic job in their particular roles and help the movie to do what it is supposed to do: tell a story. While I'm still adjusting to a fair-haired Amy Adams in the role of Lois Lane, I can say that I left the theater content with her performance. She really grew on me by the time it was all said and done. However, both Michael Shannon as Zod and Russell Crowe as Jor-El were very much spot on for me. I was extremely happy with both performances in their respective roles.<br /><br />Growing up as a huge Smallville fan, I was convinced that nobody could do the role of Clark justice after Tom Welling. While Brandon Routh fit the role physically in Superman Returns, he was just too stiff and too much of a Christopher Reeves knockoff to leave me satisfied. I'm not saying Reeves was bad in the role (quite the contrary), I just would have preferred it if Routh had brought something he could call his own to the role.<br /><br />That's where Henry Cavill comes in! The best way I can put his performance is this - he owned the role!<br /><br />You know how it goes. Often times you've seen an actor or actress cast in an iconic role, only to be dissatisfied with the choice after seeing the movie (or perhaps before and after). With Henry Cavill, I can say this, \\"Henry Cavill is Superman!\\"<br /><br />The whole time while watching the Man of Steel, I felt as if Cavill was truly an outsider from another planet. And, I mean that in the highest regard! Movies are often about the suspension of disbelief and we as moviegoers sometimes need a little push in the right direction. Cavill's performance did that for me. The fact that the guy looks like he trained day and night nonstop, tells you all you need to know about his dedication to the role. Kudos Henry!<br /><br />The special effects didn't hurt either. As far as cutting-edge special effects go, this movie has it in spades! By far the best special effects I've seen in any movie to date...hands down! Better than Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Matrix, Avatar or any of the Marvel movies, including The Avengers! Words cannot describe them, particularly the Metropolis battle scene! Truly epic!<br /><br />Speaking of battles, the fight between Supes and two notorious Kryptonians (formerly seen in another of the Big Blue Boyscout's movies) was in essence, borderline orgasmic!<br /><br />That battle seen alone was worth the price of the movie's admission!...And Man of Steel still had plenty left in reserve.<br /><br />Let's face it; we don't go to movies about comic book heroes to be bored to death by dialogue. We want action and suspense to go along with a good, relatively fast-paced story. In Man of Steel you get that!<br /><br />It currently is and will be by summer's end, the biggest and best movie you will see this summer. Mark my words!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't walk, run faster than a speeding bullet to see this movie! I promise you, you will not leave disappointed! If you do, then you're either dead or worse, a critic! \\"Gasp!\\"<br /><br />---<br /><br />As for the actual product itself, the Man of Steel Collector's Edition Combo Pack: I'm going to keep this short and sweet! Unless you are a diehard Superman fan and look to collect all things Superman, do yourself a favor and save your money. This product though somewhat (albeit barely) cool, isn't nearly as wonderful as I had hoped. :(<br /><br />Yes, it has all the film related media including both 3D and 2D versions of the film; however, the metal \\"S\\" glyph is actually a tin container identical to those that used to carry your lunch around as a kid and nothing more. I was expecting something a bit more \\"solid\\" and not a \\"lunch box\\" made to hold the movie discs, etc.<br /><br />Had this not been The Man of Steel or had I not been a huge Superman fan, and had I not purchased this product at its cheapest price point offered here on Amazon (which just so happened to be less than $10 over the cost of the regular combo pack), I would be promptly sending this item back for a refund. There's a snowball's chance in Hell that I'd pay anything above $40 for this and certainly not the $50 plus asking price Amazon originally had this listed for.<br /><br />So in summary, keep in mind when purchasing this product that it's nothing more than a \\"S\\"-shaped lunch box containing the Bluray materials inside that sit atop a plastic stand. It is NOT as nice as one might expect by looking at the picture alone, that's advertised here.<br /><br />However, once again, the movie itself is fantastic and highly recommended, but you are probably better off saving your money and simply purchasing the regular Man of Steel Combo Pack.e movie's admission!...And Man of Steel still had plenty left in reserve.<br /><br />Let's face it; we don't go to movies about comic book heroes to be bored to death by dialogue.

B008J2GAKU|3.0|I liked more aspects of this tale than I disliked but it's only a pretty good story. I like the expanded mythology of Gotham and it's history with the Wayne family but the battle with Talon was far too long.
B006TVQTHW|4.0|Overall solid quality especially for the price. Some sub-optimal design decisions though and the paint easily scratches but the cleanable screens have kept the internals dust free.
B00902AKK4|5.0|Great game you can get lost in. Great way to pass the time.It is a very entertaining game for adults and older teens.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|As an action movie, this will keep you on the edge of your seat. It has some great tense moments and enough action to make you forget what kind of bad decisions the characters are making. The hook to the movie, that makes it different from other Z movies, is a good one. My only complaint would be that there were some very large, illogical mistakes that are not very believable. Then again, it is a Z movie, so I can't complain about the realistic aspects, right?<br /><br />Conclusion: watch it, but don't expect too much.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wow I spent alot of time working on these challenges,but I made it! I got out! More levels please. Good game.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Works fantastic on my Lenovo Z400.  Integrated NIC is on 100MB, this solves the issue.  Combine with Anker powered USB 3.0 Hub and it's now a performance machine.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I just love the way SK develops his character, in this case, building on an earlier novel.  Well worth it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The Secret Society Hidden Mystery is a fun game. The variety of search choices keeps the game interesting and subsequent trips are more challenging because the objects do not remain in fixed locations. I have learned that G5 means 'Excellence'.
B008602KQI|4.0|Hunger Games is an interesting story with an excellent opportunity to teach empathy to children and well-paced action to maintain interest.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! It never gets boring and keeps challenging me!<br />Love it, love it,  love. it!!!<br />I recommend this game to all. And I thank them for making it available on my kindle.
B00457WZEI|5.0|The book, of course was better than the movie in my opinion.  However, I loved the movie as well.  It's a great story pertaining to how many horses who were in the war and the tribulations they endeared for us.  Horses helped build our country and this story describes how one incredible horse touched so many of the infantry who were lucky enough to serve with him.  Fantastic book!
B00D6C5Y28|5.0|With each post-911 year, as our rights and freedoms are gradually eroded by an increasingly invasive government, &#34;Brazil&#34; becomes less like satire and more like fact. OK so Terry went a little overboard at the end, but so did Beethoven in the 9th, and that is considered a masterpiece, right?
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|HORRIBLE QUALITY.<br />The Brightness, Contrast, Color and Sharpness are out of place and UNBELIEVABLE BAD. I tried the BluRay in THREE DIFFERENT PLAYERS and even at Best Buy. Where we tried ( When we shouldn't ) to re calibrate the LED and just made it look worst. If you are over 30, it just look like a bad copy of a VHS - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN THE BLURAY.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|A beautifully crafted Victorian version of Coronation Street, with all the formula BBC soap-drama techniques we know and love, including very short scenes, and rich production values.

B0089LOG02|5.0|Great read. Have had a hard time picking up new read since finishing this one. May just have to read it again.
B000Z1LOBI|4.0|Although it would eventually lead to the exit of one of the best guitarists in the business, Alex Skolnick (who was not on board with the new sound), Testament did make a wise move by exploring a more extreme sound in the mid-to-late Nineties. Starting with 1994's \\"Low\\" and concluding with \\"The Gathering\\" in 1999, the band ventured into a death metal-inflected thrash sound. So while 1997 `s \\"Demonic\\" might be first and foremost rooted in their patented brand of thrash/speed metal, it does have some irrefutable death influences, and even some debatable grindcore tinges.<br /><br />\\"Demonic\\" sounds positively...uh...demonic! Chuck Billy's vocals sound positively killer, and are backed up by ample musical propulsion which comes in the form of inexorable riffing, Gene Hoglan's blistering trapkit annihilation, and decent, steady bass lines. Therefore, while the album might lack some of the same kind of eargasmic guitar solos that you are used to hearing from Testament, there is more than enough of the good stuff to take up that slack.<br /><br />Opener \\"Demonic Refusal\\" kicks off with a creepy little intro that soon gives way to a thrashing groove complete with brutal, booming groove metal riffs, chug and churn rhythms, and solid bass lines. Some double bass drumming peppers the arrangements, here, as does a bout of grindcore-influenced vocals. This is then followed-up by \\"The Burnign Times,\\" which settles into a crunchy thrash groove early on, and a brief but nice and colorful acoustic breakdown not withstanding, remains there for the duration of the song. Said breakdown aside, the first real, fleshed-out spot of melody comes in the next track, \\"Together As One,\\" which sandwiched a nicely melodic guitar solo in between its round of chunky chainsaw riffing.<br /><br />Another standout, \\"Jun Jun,\\" is the next tune, and a very appropriately entitled one at that, as it is filled with tons of \\"jun jun\\"-sounding guitar hooks. It also comes with pounding drums, anthemic vocals, a catchy main groove, and wah-wah-inflected leads. Then, following two ferociously riffed and air-guitar-able numbers in \\"John Doe\\" and the walloping blast beat-esque-backed \\"Murky Waters,\\" we are treated to some of the album's best and lengthiest guitar soloing in \\"Hatreds Rise.\\" But it's right back to the grind when \\"Distorted Lives\\" rolls around, as it is a beast of a song that adheres to blistering death-thrash riffage.<br /><br />\\"New Eyes Of Old\\" is a keeper on account of it having anthemic, melodically sing-songy vocals in its choruses, but its ripping guitar solo makes sure that it is much more than just merely decent. \\"Nostrovia\\" is a darkly pounding, lurching closing blast, but it is almost overshadowed by what comes immediately before it: \\"Ten Thousand Thrones,\\" which is driven by furious, precise, and uber-tight double bass slamming/thrashing.<br /><br />If you are new to Testament, do not start this album. But everybody else should line-up even if they have the slightest chance to purchase \\"Demonic.\\" After all, it is one record that will leave you limp, oddly satisfied, and yet simultaneously somehow wanting more. It is Testament's \\"Reign In Blood.\\", a catchy main groove, and wah-wah-inflected leads. Then, following two ferociously riffed and air-guitar-able numbers in \\"John Doe\\" and the walloping blast beat-esque-backed \\"Murky Waters,\\" we are treated to some of the album's best and lengthiest guitar soloing in \\"Hatreds Rise.\\" But it's right back to the grind when \\"Distorted Lives\\" rolls around, as it is a beast of a song that adheres to blistering death-thrash riffage.<br /><br />\\"New Eyes Of Old\\" is a keeper on account of it having anthemic, melodically sing-songy vocals in its choruses, but its ripping guitar solo makes sure that it is much more than just merely decent. \\"Nostrovia\\" is a darkly pounding, lurching closing blast, but it is almost overshadowed by what comes immediately before it: \\"Ten Thousand Thrones,\\" which is driven by furious, precise, and uber-tight double bass slamming/thrashing.<br /><br />If you are new to Testament, do not start this album.

B0001MLMKY|5.0|This replaced a watch I bought 31 years ago while on a cruise to Charlotte Amalie.  Except for replacing a battery every two years it never let me down once.  I wore it m-f for 11 years then set it aside after receiving a new watch for Christmas.  After a year of looking I had to replace an &#34;old friend&#34;.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|I have enjoyed all the Iron Man movies. This one was probably as good as Iron Man 2. It is a great explosion laden comic book flick... Do you really need to go much deeper than that when deciding whether to watch Iron Man or not?
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I thought it set up the next or oldest series very well.  As a prequil it hit all the marks and explaind some of the history well.  Acting by Scott Bakula was great.  Jolene Blalock was good, a little flat in delivery but then she did play a Vulcan.  The supporting cast was ok, whoever played the Doctor wore his makeup very well.  Interesting stories at first, the 2nd and 3rd seasons were a little rough.  But it had a one of the best endings of a series.
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|Salvant has amazing range, wit, and passion. Original and exciting take on &#34;What a Little Moonlight Can Do&#34;. Can't wait to see her in concert.
B0065IZEE8|4.0|Terminally ill with cancer, 29-year-old James (Benedict Cumberbatch) knows there is not much time left for him. So James sets out for a journey to Barafundle Bay in Pembrokeshire, Wales, together with three of his best friends Davy (Tom Burke), Miles (J. J. Field) and Bill (Adam Robertson). And there is one thing that James has to do at this beautiful place.<br /><br />Directed by Hattie Dalton (her debut) and written by Vaughan Sivell (his first work as a screenwriter), \\"Third Star\\" - reference to \\"Peter Pan\\" - benefits from the beautiful locations and the strong performances from the cast, especially Benedict Cumberbatch, (better known as \\"Sherlock\\") who here literally becomes the ailing character.<br /><br />The story itself is rather predictable. The main four characters are all credible, but some episodes involving eccentric characters the travelers encounter on the road seem prolonged. Still, the film successfully builds up the emotion towards the end that is full of impact.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Find this album a lot different from her previous ones , but she is Gaga she did not get her name to be nothing this album is not boring it has dancing music maby one or 2 songs r slow but we need some of those too mix it in with the dancing ones ...lady Gaga always has good touch of songs that she wants on her album , I think her #1 album just dance was a lot better then the 2nd one nd this one , I like her nd I like how she twists it up with different beats of music I'm always going to b fan keep it up Gaga :)
B00A2H9WW8|3.0|The 2013 remake of \\"Carrie\\" is not really a bad film. You know, with Chloë Grace Moretz as the titular heroine Carrie White, it just cannot be. The problem is, I see no point in remaking or \\"re-imagining\\" the 1970s cult classic.<br /><br />Those who have seen the 1976 original directed by Brian De Palma know the story. It is about a 17-year-old girl Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz), bullied and abused, who suddenly discover that she has a special power. In the meanwhile, a girl banned from the prom concocts a plan with her boyfriend, to humiliate Carrie in front of the students.<br /><br />The director is Kimberly Peirce of \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" fame, and she clearly thinks, rightly, that \\"Carrie\\" is more than just a scary tale. It is also a sad coming-of-age story about a lonely soul, and Chloë Grace Moretz becomes one in a very convincing way - when the film does not overuse the special effects.<br /><br />For visual effects are a little disappointing during and after the famous prom scene. Also, Chloë Grace Moretz, talented as she is, may be a little miscast as Carrie White, who looks less creepy and menacing than the one played by Sissy Spacek.<br /><br />As you expect, Julianne Moore steals scenes as Carrie's abusive mother, but the rest of the supporting players are not very memorable. After all it is Carrie who takes the center stage, but what she does there is no longer astonishing or shocking.
B0095P31L6|5.0|I've watched this over and over. On my Kindle anywhere I go. It is so funny and lots of silly action. Adorable and very entertaining.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Great movie! My daughter just loves it and finally we can get it on Blu-ray.  The Diamond edition has the usual Disney extras.  You already know if you want this movie so go ahead and get it! They don't get cheaper with age!
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|My son and I saw this move on Imax and I bought it also. I do love the colors, the gorgeous land of oz, which was why I bought it, but I just didn't care for that the way the 'witch' scenes took up most of the movie. It was just too much of it. They didn't give us time to enjoy the travel to oz like Dorothy did. It was chaos as soon as he landed, just about. The actors for the witches didn't fit the characters except for the good witch. The first one thought she was too beautiful. You could see it in her face and she over-did the 'innocent me' act. The second witch should have stayed in her 'Mummy' movie and the good witch actress was perfect for her character.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|This book managed to be both well-written and boring at the same time.  It may be a matter of personal taste, but I expected something more than I got and to be frank, I did not quite finish it.  I doubt I will.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I just simply love it. The time setting, acting and plot are fantastic. If you like  drama, this is for you.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|This is, quite simply, Gladwell's weakest work to date.  The book lacked a true central theme and the information, while interesting for the most part, lack cohesion.  It was a relatively easy read but failed to fully satisfy.

B00ENXBUR2|4.0|Everyone knows the Superman story - it's one that's seemingly burned into the subconscious from birth. So clearly and definitively rendered was this comic tale in Christopher Reeve's 1978 blockbuster that the last filmmaker to tackle the character (X-Men's Bryan Singer) lifted its iconography wholesale for 2006 misfire Superman Returns.<br /><br />That film was hamstrung by nostalgia and left audiences nonplussed, so the latest big-screen version is understandably a clean break from the past with Dark Knight duo Christopher Nolan and David S Goyer hatching a story to re-invent DC Comics' flagship hero.<br /><br />Man of Steel begins on Krypton as Lara (Ayelet Zurer) and Jor-El (Russell Crowe) welcome the planet's first natural birth in centuries. Their people, once ambitious intergalactic explorers, genetically engineer newborns to serve in pre-determined roles. With the planet's natural resources exhausted and Krypton in its final days, Jor-El rockets his son to safety as military leader General Zod (Michael Shannon) stages a last-minute coup with designs on purifying the race and starting over. He's banished to the Phantom Zone, but only after vowing to find Kal-El.<br /><br />Director Zack Snyder then makes a daring cut from Kal's plummeting rocket to a fishing trawler carrying a bearded Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), wandering the globe looking to help those in need. In a neat structural trick similar to the one employed in Batman Begins, we flash back to see a younger Clark struggling through adolescence due to his nascent superpowers. In the present day, a spaceship buried deep in the Arctic Circle points Clark in the direction of his destiny, while also putting him on a collision course with a Zod hellbent on resurrecting his obliterated home world.<br /><br />Whereas previous films have used Lois Lane (here gamely played by Amy Adams) as a key emotional crutch for Superman, here the emphasis is on fathers and sons, the push-pull between Kryptonian and human heritage and Clark's desire for belonging and acceptance.<br /><br />Screenwriter Goyer cleverly plays out this thematic thread between Clark, the Kents and Jor-El ('alive' as an echo of his preserved consciousness), while also keeping it a key component to Zod's masterplan (and thus a way to conjure up jaw-dropping spectacle).<br /><br />Snyder's instincts as an action director quickly come to the fore as he marshals skirmishes on Krypton, a huge-scale battle in Smallville and a Metropolis smack-about that sends Superman and Zod careening through skyscrapers. With the latest digital tools at its disposal, Man of Steel is easily the most exhilarating and arresting interpretation of Superman yet. When Cavill's predecessors took flight it all seemed so leisurely. Here, his lift-offs are positively supersonic.<br /><br />The Brit actor cuts an impressive figure both in and out of the red and blue. He tackles the role without a trace of irony, meaning he's in keeping with the straight-arrow seriousness of the film but perhaps lacking the immediate charm of Reeve's Superman. When it comes to sheer physicality, though, he's far more dynamic and intimidating than any of his predecessors. Snyder and co have gone to great lengths to ditch the boy scout label.<br /><br />Man of Steel's supporting players, a veritable who's who of A-list talent, are all excellent in their limited screen time. Daily Planet chief Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) acts as a nice counterweight to Lois's early eagerness to expose Clark's anonymous do-goodery, while Shannon is chilling in his dogged commitment to duty.<br /><br />Costner and Crowe both crucially find emotional poignancy as the guiding lights who help Clark on his way to greatness. They're helped in part by a great score by Hans Zimmer, who hits upon a motif that can be tinkled quietly on the piano or blasted out by an orchestra.<br /><br />Impressive as all this is, Man of Steel is not quite the perfect movie. Snyder's deployment of handheld camerawork works to create an intimacy between viewer and action, but this aesthetic jars horrendously with the 3D conversion (see in 2D if you can). Character loses focus in favor of action in the final third and there are also shades of Clark's character that go unexplored (for instance his split identity and deeper relationship with Lois). These threads are left tantalisingly open for a sequel, though. The foundations are firmly in place for what could be exciting further adventures of Superman.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Surprisingly good. I did not think much of this movie when it came out but I was really happy with how compelling it was for zombie movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is so Stephen King! His imagination is scary. Can't wait to finish reading it and start another one of his books
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Very well written. Written so the average person can understand. This book has really motivated me. Eating plan is easy to follow.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series is amazing. It's more than sex..it's a love store..just with a little extra.;)  it's heart stoppingly good. LOVE!
006202406X|1.0|So if the author wanted a way to make me hate the series, never re-read it and don't go to see the movies, she succeeded. I hated it, for multiple reasons. Plus, did anyone else hate when Tris's mother showed up at the end? Seemed like a complete rip off of what happened in books 4 and 7 of Harry Potter. And the more that I think about it, the more I wish I had never read these books to begin with. Such a sloppy, stupid ending.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever I've played this for a whole hour and six minutes you should try this game really
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Top notch horror flick! Love this movie, which contains but one case of the Warrens many. This story can be watched year round and still... one will feel the chilling effects... The absolute horror which awaits those whom delve too deeply into the other side!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoyed this game very MUCH; definetly worth playing.  Brings back memories of the carnivals when I was young.  Check it out for yourself.
B00BMKH5NW|2.0|The writing style of this author was of good quality and the reason I gave it two stars instead of one but the story itself was boring in my opinion. Nothing much ever happened. I also found the story within the story irritating. It was very choppy and towards the end of the book I started skipping those parts just to get through the book faster.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|it really made you think about your tasks. and the extra chapter was just awesome I really like the artwork and sound effects. I will recommend this to my friends and family and hardly wait for the next one
B000OCXIDK|5.0|I enjoyed this story because there was a story line to which one can relate.  I have been to Delft and have seen the places described in the book.  It delights me to recall things I have seen when they are mentioned in books or shown in movies.  Also the existence of a full spectrum of life emotions was there, not just &#34;skits of sexplay&#34; whith a main character who is beautiful, unbelieveable lucky and always ends up materially rich, which I find so unreal.  Life seems so much more interesting when problems are worked through instead of &#34;zapped&#34; to perfection.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is just the right combination of fun, drama and cute men!  The storyline has moral value - good vs. bad.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Excellent 2D spacecraft building game. Would highly recommend to someone who loves Kerbal Space Program and wants a similar experience on their phone!
B005JE7XW0|5.0|It's hard to find a good spoof.  I haven't had that much fun watching a horror movie spoof since Army of Darkness.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|really like the new sound of this album!! These guys still got it going on, for sure.  Nice and heavy with great vocals and tight instruments.  Glad they are back
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Not a a bad movie but certainly not as good as the first 2 Iron Man installments. The movie is substantially more campy than its 2 predecessors, particularly in the 2nd act. Too many moments that leave you scratching your head as to why Iron Man behaved in the manner he did.  I had a difficult time with the unbelievable villains and shifty plot lines. All in all a fun pop corn movie that does not live up to its predecessors.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the calculator a-lot!  It comes very handy 8)  Get it,  you'll love it. :p. It comes very useful when I'm doing school! :p
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|I follow HONY on Facebook which lead me to purchase that book and I loved it!!! It was quite interesting to say the least.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a great game. I suggest that a lot of people download this game and get to playing it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was initially difficult to get into as there was a lot of time and place switching (noted under each chapter title and easy to miss.) What kept me going was the fun and funny voices of the protagonists, Nick and Amy. And once I got going, I found myself carrying the book around wherever I went in the hopes I could read another few pages. The story unfolded like the Scott Petersen murder, and then took a twist, getting stranger and stranger with each quickly-turned page. Unfortunately, the ending left me a bit cold. Like a cold cloth on an otherwise hot, exciting ride.
B002RXHW6S|5.0|Perfect for my 1yr olds 1st bday I would have paid 300 cash and still been happy this is a great buy the people who didn't like it are ignorant if it ripped think alittle this is for babys duhhhh lol
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Sci-fi bought this for the 3D version. Grandkids love this movie with all the action and the one liners by the hulk.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Really look app, It holds My attention and I'm sure it will hold anyone else's. I like its shake feature and the giant coins. I like it, I like it, I like it.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|I have become a person who likes the 3D movies, The sci-fi seems to provide the best special effects where you move your head so as not to be hit by flying debris from explosions,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best app ever! And its kind of like temple run.... but its funnier! Plus great graphics and its easy to control plus it loads and downloads very easily!! I will never delet this app.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really do love jigsaw puzzles, so I was quite pleased to find this  app. I would have given 5 stars, but it's a bit unstable at times.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|It was a very good movie Iike the fast action I like action movies that have pleanty of action in it.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|A very interesting introduction to the DevOps concepts.  Similar to the type of presentation in The Deadline: A Novel About Project Management, by Tom DeMarco: a fictional account of the particular information technology subject.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|It works, but not great.  It doesn't always charge and you have to work with it to get the charging light to come on.  I got frustrated and ended up buying the REAL one that actually is made for the kindle so I wished I had saved my money on this.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Very entertaining and clean reading. I was Very disappointed in the end though. After reading  the first two  I couldn't wait until the third book came out. I would definitely recommend the trilogy.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great app and you don't have to deal with the Game Center on the Kindle.  Have the same app on my iphone and that one is definately glitchy, but this one is great.
B0027CNFR4|3.0|First let me say, I loved the first Bridget Jones' Diary. All the characters in the original movie were just too funny and charming in so many ways. They each held their own. I can't help watching it over and over again laughing at the same things each time. It was very well done.<br /><br />The problem I have with this second movie is Bridget herself. One of the things I was counting on was for Bridget to be a bit more mature and not finding herself in situations that totally embarrassed her and Mark. You would think she would have developed a bit more sophistication, if for no other reason but to understand that she is now finding herself in Mark's inner circle. I found it very hard to watch most of this movie due to her total idiocy! Not only that, she looks like she is another twenty pounds heavier on top of the weight she had in the first movie. In other words, she looked and acted worse in this movie than the first. I understand some of the situations she found herself in, but seriously I think the producers painted her in such a bad light that it bordered on the rediculous.<br /><br />The supporting cast did a great job continuing their rolls in this movie, but for the most part it was just one mishap after another one. I was so hoping that this second movie would also develop Bridget and Mark's relationship (courtship) a bit more, for after all, that is what we all want to see. The first movie ended in such a great uplifting way that I would have like to see that carried on to this one, but it seemed to go down hill instead, and not for any particular reason except for misunderstandings by Bridget herself. I'm sure that was, to some extent, the whole purpose of the movie was to have things go so wrong that their love was to be tested. But, really, it was just too much. This movie was sorely lacking in their having a romantic relationship that you would have thought they would have built on after the end of the first movie.<br /><br />The end was somewhat predicable, but at least it worked. Obviously, there probably won't be a third movie, and that's too bad. There were some laughs in this movie, but for most of it, you had to feel totally embarrassed for Mark. Like I said earlier, I was sadden that  Bridget, herself, looked so bad in this one, that it makes you wonder what on earth Mark sees in her now.dicable, but at least it worked. Obviously, there probably won't be a third movie, and that's too bad. There were some laughs in this movie, but for most of it, you had to feel totally embarrassed for Mark.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|Love Gillian Flynn !! Her stories are great even if you sometimes hate the characters , you can start to understand why they are so effing crazy !
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel Washington is awesome in this movie!!! This is another one of his  movies I enjoyed.  Great movie!! Don't hesitate to watch it because you will enjoy, He is such a great actor, very versatile because he can play any part, and do it well.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Another great action movie.  However, it falls slightly short in terms of developing characters and dealing with complex issues.  A different take on an infamous Star Trek lore character.  Technical film work is excellent, sometimes the science stretches a bit.  Good for a movie night at home.
B002M7A79S|5.0|Everything you would expect and more. Lots of questions answered. A fitting end to a great series. More would be better, but it doesn't disappoint.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie keeps you guessing throughout.  As much as I thought I was up on where the movie was going, it still caught me be surprise with the ending.  Well-paced, the movie is a classic in the magician's art of misdirection.  I would definitely watch this one again.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I've played online with a lot of freezing, which made the game less enjoyable. So far, I haven't had any problems until today. Overall, it's a good way to kill time &amp; I will recommend this game to others.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Possibly one of the best science fiction novels ever written.  Hooked me twenty years ago and I just finished it for the fifth time.
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|Reminds me of skull monkeys!  I have this game on my phone and beat it. I wish this one was free too but 99 cents isn't bad
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Better than some others of its kind.  It was kind of hard to completely follow until the almost the end.
B00E9A656K|4.0|the problem is the fact that you cant sell cars. otherwise itd be a top notch game. make that an option please.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Very Action oriented movie - Just like the rest.  It's worth it but I would not put it at the top of my list.
B00G4I0DNG|5.0|I watched this in theaters when it was released, and it shocked me. It is a very powerful documentary that everyone should see. I loved it!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I dont want to say a whole lot but this app probably fixed ally problems of taking great pics! I totally recommend this app
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Reminds us if our days in Hawaii.  The songs are so beautiful and Israel had such a beautiful voice. We have lost a wonderful singer
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep was an awesome sequel to the Shining! I love getting to know Danny as an adult and be involved with his struggles. It's very exciting to find out that he is not alone in this world as he thought for his entire adult life.<br /><br />This is a must read!
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|Funny and chemistry was great. A good movie for most, as the story line is light and the humor is light hearted and funny.
B003G4W49C|4.0|2013-11-12
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I'm so glad this finally came out for kindle, I've been waiting so long, I got the pc version of terraria and now the pe version! I can't wait for an update,  the controls are a bit difficult to get used to but otherwise it's great!!! I give this app a 4 1/2 out of 5
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I bought this for my husband's kindle fire. The case is very strong and sturdy. We both love how it converts to a stand; easy for reading or watching Netflix in bed. I bought a similar one for my kindle as well!
B00BEIN9VO|4.0|I just placed an order for the 20/20 experience vinyl record and it comes with a mp3 of the album but when i downloaded the mp3 album it was part 2 (the 20/20 experience- 2 of 2) and I really wanted the one that goes with the Record i purchased .. other then that mix up I love this album!!!!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|The BEST movie ever made!! This is the superman I have been waiting to see since I was a kid.
B001974DG0|5.0|First read this book when it came out and just rediscovered it on my kindle and d I'd a reread. Still a great story and even more plausible with the way technology is today.
0307346617|5.0|This is one of the best and most interesting books I have ever read. The stories are brilliantly realistic and I almost forget that it's complete fiction. Warning, this book is not the movie. If you think the movie was a BMW then you will think this book is the Space Shuttle!!! Max Brooks is a genius who has taken the zombie genre to a new unexpected level.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think this book is a great book as well as series, it is more than just another erotic novel the love story portrayed is a magnificent one.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|LOVED this game. Played through in just a couple hours--couldn't put it down! It's short, but still worth the price, for sure. Can't WAIT for the next chapter!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Good read. Will read other books by this author. Recommend for others to read as well. Good book.<br />Really done.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is just as fun as the Facebook version i love it. It is addictive i want to play all the time.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love playing this game when I'm looking to kill some time. Relaxing music to listen to while you play as well.
B000CNESU8|5.0|This movie was so far ahead of its time that few people grasped what it was saying at the time. Myself included.<br /><br />At first I didn't like it because the message bothered me. What I didn't understand was that it was a warning.<br /><br />The film foreshadows Fox, toxic radio and the rest of today's junk news biz.<br /><br />And now, unfortunately, CBS..
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is an awesome app! Especially for writing ideas. When you get this app, you should put a password on it to keep your stuff safe! But don't forget the password, or you'll have to replace it. :(
B00A2H9OZS|5.0|They just don't make them like this anymore.  With the ever growing trend of churning out PG-13 flicks, it's awesome that Riddick went back to rated R.  This movie only made it to the big screen because of Vin Diesel's passion for the character of Riddick.  He put up his own home to fund much of the budget.  He said he felt like he made a promise to the fans to bring it back.<br /><br />Vin wants to follow this movie up with at least another sequel with hopefully a much bigger budget and on a much bigger scale (think Chronicles).  Vin wants to take Riddick through the Underverse to Furya or something like that.  I hope it happens.  I absolutely love the Riddick universe and want to see the mythos expanded.  The problem is Vin isn't getting any younger.  I wish his priorities were the Riddick movies and not the Fast and Furious movies, but those Fast movies make all the money, unfortunately.  Vin says he can't put out sequels to Riddick like Fast and Furious because \\"they're too dark\\".  Come on, that's not the reason.  But whatever, I'm glad we got to see a real Riddick movie again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book! Finished it in 2 days! You won't be able to stop reading! It's worth every penny!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|great mix of drama, action, chaos, conflict and real-life lessons and fine acting!<br />Let's have more movies like this in the Amazon lineup
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Same (well, maybe a bit better...) as the one I originally purchased with the Kindle Fire two years ago.  Good quality. Well put together.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Outstanding read! War and people were very different back then. People would say it was the good old days. Great book
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love  playing bingo and the different rooms and challenges. Just wish there was a way to win more bingo play chips
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great app! Fun to play. Great graphics. So real. Recommend for hunters who don't have time to get out during the seasons.
1589795474|5.0|This book was an amazing read! I learned so much that I have applied to my life. Changed my life! Great resource to refer to on a regular basis and even amazing to reread in order to ensure you are utilizing all the information that was supplied in the book.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Touching story about how easily we can misunderstand someone.  Everyone of us has a purpose and is a valuable creation of God.  The purpose is not always obvious, and is often hidden from us until the time is right.  The most amazing things can happen when we least expect them.
030758836X|4.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" Review<br />  As Nick returns home from another normal day at work , he expects nothing but to open the door and greet his wife. Well, Nick indeed returns back home... but not to anywhere near what he expected. He comes home to a crime scene that depicts his \\"worst\\" nightmare. His wife, Amy, has gone missing. But what nobody seems to realize is that for the past while, their marriage has been going terribly, terribly wrong.<br />  I thought I had become overly involved with this book when I began reading it. The way the story was being told from both Amy and Nick's perspectives had me rereading a few sections and sometimes began to aggravate me. It made it difficult to know what was really going on because the time frame and the narrators kept switching. But this change in point of views made me skeptical on whose side I should truly be on as Nick stated, \\"That was my tenth lie to the police.\\" But that seemed to make reading all the better.  I could tell that it was going to be the type of book that always kept you on yours toes and making you always eager to read more. As the book carries on, I became more and more surprised and even caught off guard at some points but this made reading ahead so much easier.<br />  As I got about three quarters of the way through the book, the back and forth of it all stopped being realistic and slowly began to lose my interest. Some of the characters flipped from good to incredibly evil in ways I legitimately could not believe. Not to mention, after becoming less intrigued with the book, the ending was horrible. Overall, it frustrated me. I wasn't disappointed. I was simply upset that I read the whole book only to get to that as the ending. I can't begin to explain how much I despised the ending of the book. I started with not being able to ever put the book down, to wanting to throw it against a wall.<br />  Besides the ending of the book, I do not have many complaints at all. The biggest criticism I have is that there is quite the large amount of foul language and a few vulgar descriptions within the book. I understand that sometimes language such as this is used to build their character but it began to become a disappointment. It did not drastically affect my readings but considering how many other words could have been chosen just made me less interested in the book and began to dissatisfy me as the profane language was overused.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|This book is flat out scary and after finishing it I closed out my twitter membership. I have also used this book several times as a real conversation starter.  It takes the a silicon Valley culture and social media to its absurdist but frighteningly believable extremes by telling the story of a normal, impressionable young woman who just wants to please. She is gradually shaped into evilness with no sense of accountability for her actions because, well at least partly because her brain is kept so darned busy with all her zings and surveys and responding to her followers that she loses any ability to analyze her life or gain any perspective whatsoever. This book tells a story that creepily could actually happen.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Grabs you in the middle, but what a cheesy ending. I don't get the hype over this book...how many weeks on the best seller list?
B008JFUOVI|5.0|Brand new, in package, worked perfectly, very satisfied with purchase.  The movie was excellent and I fully recommend this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun for ages from 1-60. I am have a litte troblem with levea 15. Could you give hit.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|We are Star Trek fans.  We have watched the all the programs in the original series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and all of the movies.  We weren't sure we would like Voyager, but decided to try it on Amazon Prime Instant Video.  We have become fans of Voyager as well.  Although at first glance it looks like a PC version with the various genders and ethnicities, we find that the characters fit well in their roles and interact well together.  We have finished season 1 and are almost finished with season 2.  Some of the episodes leave us wondering what they were trying to do, overall we like the series and are looking forward to finishing the remaining seasons.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Awesome fun until you hit a level you can't beat then you become frustrated and put it away.  Wish there was a way to get through those levels in less time. Just a personal wish...
B0034G4P80|5.0|We have liked the Avengers and Iron Man movies, so we thought we would try Thor.  We enjoyed it as well.  If you like this type of movie, we expect that you will Thor, as well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read it on vacation and couldn't put it down. Quick read and then had to buy the rest of the series
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|This is a Good family movie. Just as cute as the first one. Will defiantly be purchasing this one in the future
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is a must read!  My son began reading these books in his elementary school class.  I had to review his daily reading logs to ensure he understood what he was reading. While reading his entries, it made me want to begin reading the book! Then the movie came out and I was hooked!  These are easy reads and so much better than the movie (aren't they always). Please, buy this set, you will not regret it!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|awesome read good story and steamy but not too overboard great story to them as well...highly reccomend. Love the whole series
B000002A46|4.0|I love Christmas albums and this is one I enjoy listening to.  It get's old after a while and this is not one I would play over and over like I do other albums.
B001J710Y8|5.0|Great classic &#34;occult&#34; type horror or thriller (more thriller than horror, I would say) from the early 70's - you just can't get that type of vibe from anything modern.  The film quality is very good (not all grainy and &#34;primitive&#34;), and the story is gripping.  It may seem slow the first time you watch it, especially compared to modern films that feel compelled to fill every minute with explosions or gore or some sort of effect or action.  This one unfolds at its own pace, and the situation is set up brilliantly and sustained to the end.  But go back and watch it a second time, and let it be for what it is, and I think you'll really appreciate it as something worth watching and savoring over and over.  Christopher Lee is great, of course, and the island itself is a great cast member.  The island and the strange inhabitants work together to create an atmosphere where everything is seemingly normal on the surface and at first glance, but strangely foreign and macabre just under the surface.  As the conservative Christian detective from mainstream society slowly discovers, the pagan society, isolated on the island, has sinister plans.  A great cult classic and slightly obscure addition to your horror collection!
0316227706|5.0|The photos in this book are simply amazing!  The photographer captured these dogs just perfectly and these are 10 times better to view in person rather than over the web.  I am impressed with the quality of this book and am highly satisfied with my purchase.  Made a great Christmas gift for the dog lover in my family!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I liked the insight into the mind set of the people during the life and times of Jesus Christ.  This book really helped me to get definition of why certain statements were made.  It helped to know where Jesus and the disciples and Apostle Paul were coming from.  However I do believe that the writer did not put into consideration what God's bigger plan is.  If you look at just the human or natural side of the incidents that happened, you would May think that Jesus lost his fight.  But he did not.  God's plan was accomplished and it is still marching forward to that great day!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|5 Star's all the way.  Can't get enough of this movie, it leaves me almost crying from laughter throughout the entire thing. Betty White is hilarious and my favorite part is dancing to the Eastside boys in the woods!
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|I can't believe that I waited this long to see it.  Especially since, I discovered that Orson Welles was in our family tree!!  The movie<br />is definitely one of the best movies, if not the best, that I have ever seen.  I also enjoyed the documentary that came with it.
B00A2H9P98|1.0|This video has it all... a hugely slanted political agenda, offensively simplistic plot elements that would need work to approach the sophistication and believability of a typical \\"Gilligan's Island\\" or \\"The Suite Life on Deck\\" episode, unrealistic combat sequences, OK special effects and mediocre-to-poor performances by all the actors. Not a bad film if you are semi-conscious, I suppose. Would have been much better with the dialogue muted. Overall, I think it would have been more enjoyable to spend that time trying to sign up for insurance through the affordable health care Website.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|this is awesome I play it all day my only problem is I think buying the credits are expensive,  but all in all, its great!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|You have to purchase levels if you can't get past them. I would rather have paid up front without the nonsense.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a nice multifaceted game that will keep you busy. Refresh rates are good. It works well with kindle fire.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is an action-packed movie.  It has some tender moments but the brutality between children (even teens) takes some emotion toll.  As long as my teens understand it is just fiction and we did discuss it, it is pretty good movie as action flicks go.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|That is truly the word to describe the last book of the Wheel of Time series; exquisite. As the culmination of decades of work this last installment of this fantasy epic is truly and deeply satisfying. Rarely have I been so happy to read the end of a book I truly enjoyed. Though this great mind did not live to finish his saga, my thanks and praise go out to him and his wife an all of those that worked to make this story come to such wondrous life.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|She sounds familiar yet so freshen up.. she is definitely one of a kind and either you hate her or love her SHE HAS TALENT and that is an undeniable fact!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I got this app thinking that this insomnia be great. Played 5 minutes and it froze my whole kindle!!!! Had to restart in 3 times before it work at all<br /> Don't get it not worth your time
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Fantabulous rendition of the Original Shakespeare in a very conversational style (No bombastic monologues to the sky), with an updated flair. Filming in Black and White was genius and adds a great touch to the overall feel.  The music as a character all on its own. . . . just a great film. Definitely worth seeing and all the familiar faces just puts it right over the top.
B00FFHG6KQ|2.0|Terrible graphics!! They force you to use one finger playing even when you choose classic. Takes way to long for them to shoot and or start running
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Another book that &#34;couldn't put down&#34; .We are almost living this story in this here and now. Am sure it is our future.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Best app on Amazon and by far the most useful. Everything else is sub par at best, most apps in the Amazon app store are 3 party knockoff apps that don't quite work how they should. Be grateful that the official Wikipedia app is available to Amazon users.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|The walking dead  tv series is a great  show to watch and its good to know that i can buy  the dvd  and always watch  the deleted scenes
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Usually people hate their alarm clocks, but this one is so easy to use!  And has many many different alarms, my favorite is safari and world.
B008B9JSKU|5.0|hello how are you .can you tell me this movie subtitles?i like this movie thank you very much  good good
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A lot of the things i read in this book served to reinforce the ways you can use the law of attraction. With its creative, relatively short and informative style, it helped me see the reality that the law of attraction plays in our lives. Deffinelty a good read for anyone seeking to implement the law of attraction more effectively. Heck there are experiments that are so easy to do, you mite be shocked at your results. Much love !
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Friends is the best TV show ever made. This pack is a must have for anyone who loves the show.
B00F0349LS|5.0|This is a must listen for any Placebo fan. My boyfriens and I listen to it and he is younger he want to hear everything Placebo now.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is easily my favorite author, so I of course loved this book!  If you like dark twisty novels that explore the dysfunctional side of the human relationship and conscience, you will love it too!
B00EVW04PE|3.0|Very good cast. Humor was a little odd at times. Plot was ho hum. My wife enjoyed it and she usually detests these kind of movies.
B009G41CG2|5.0|Great game, you really have to work at the puzzles to win, many different layouts and it is very addictive.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Great director laboring with a bad script (His own).  I watched this on a 17 hour train ride. Good way to break the tedium.
B00EK0UBPU|4.0|This book is a difficult read, not one you can easily dip into in bed at the end of a day without struggling to pick up its entanglements and recall who is who.<br />The intricacies of the narrative and interplay between a big cast mean it is not meant to be a modern-day leisure read, but something to be regarded as a piece of literature, thus demanding almost as much from the reader as it did from the writer.<br />Nonetheless, it became for me a terrific comfort at the end of the day, knowing this was not a story that would burn brightly then disappear, never to be remembered. It would be there at the bedside for some considerable time, and it would reward by its very denseness.<br />This book endured for weeks, and now I have finished it there is a sense of loss, that the saga of reading it is finished, and what could there possibly be to follow it and provide an equal sense of adsorption.<br />Such writing is all too rare.
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|With each album release, it seems as though Lady Gaga wants to make a bigger spectacle with each one.  It was appropriate, as each album was bigger in scope than the last, and arguably she has succeeded in outdoing prior efforts with new offerings.  The Fame was a care-free club romp, The Fame Monster was a dark journey into Gaga's psyche, and Born This Way was an all-out rock-flavored pop opera about self-acceptance.  ARTPOP is Gaga's much-hyped return, and while it's got plenty of great moments, it manages to fall short of complete greatness.<br /><br />The biggest issue plaguing ARTPOP is that Gaga seemed to have stopped working on each song a bit prematurely.  Some songs sound lyrically unfinished, some songs sound like they needed more cleanup, and some are just way too excessive.  In the end though, ARTPOP is a good listen, just not on the same level as Born This Way or The Fame Monster.<br /><br />What the album does get right is its EDM-fueled production.  There's no mistaking you're listening to a new Gaga album when you listen to ARTPOP.  \\"Aura\\" is a masterpiece...which should be no surprise given that Infected Mushroom was [reluctantly] involved.  \\"Do What U Want\\" is a fantastic, bouncy pop song with a perfectly-placed guest spot by R. Kelly.  The title track, \\"ARTPOP\\", is a slinky, sexy electrotrip.  \\"Donatella\\" is simply a joy to listen to with some clever commentary, and it's followed by \\"Fashion!\\", which is easily one of the best tracks here.  It sounds like a mix of Madonna's \\"Holiday\\" with David Bowie's \\"Fame\\" and \\"Let's Dance\\", and Gaga pulls it off fantastically.  I would love to see this song as a single!  Finally, there's \\"Gypsy\\".  This is the glitzy, showy Gaga we all know and love.  Combined with Madeon's production, the song will make you want to jump up and down as she shouts \\"Toniiiiiiiiight!!!\\"  This is the album's most exciting moment for me.  It is the perfect track to lead into the closing track, the incredibly catchy and irresistible \\"Applause\\".<br /><br />But then there are songs like \\"Swine\\", which has a riveting pre-chorus before it falls apart in excessive noise breaks.  \\"Mary Jane Holland\\" is a huge mess...with a slow bassline and a chanting of the title that pushes it into grating territory.  \\"Dope\\" is the piano ballad that's analogous to past performances like \\"Speechless\\" or \\"You and I\\", but here it sounds rushed and uninspired.  Finally, there's \\"Jewels N' Drugs\\".  This is not only the absolute worst moment on this album, it's easily the worst moment in Lady Gaga's entire repertoire.  The song is terrible.  It doesn't go with anything else on here, and it's far removed from anything that anyone would consider \\"art pop\\".  It sounds like it belongs on a rap album in which Gaga makes a cameo, as her part in the song is so small compared to that of T.I., Too $hort and Twista.  It's so bad that you can't even enjoy \\"MANiCURE\\" (the next track) because the awfulness of \\"Jewels N' Drugs\\" still hasn't worn off.<br /><br />So what we're left with is a good album that's held back by a few tracks.  Fans of Lady Gaga (myself included) will either love the album immediately or grow to love what she's offered here.  But I get the feeling that anyone who's already annoyed at Gaga's style of performing won't change their mind by listening to ARTPOP.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read this book twice before but it never fails to dredge up the same powerful emotions. Definitely one of my favorites. Also a word of caution to any fan of the book contemplating watching the movie: just don't. It's a disgrace.

The information is woven into her personal story which is interesting and creates some suspense as it goes. the book holds the interest and is an easy read, but is not shallow.  both helpful and entertaining, glad i read it.
B00942G4UA|5.0|An amazingly researched, beautifully told, and frightening investigation into the transformation of American food production into big business, with alarming consequences for both farmers and consumers. It covers so many aspects of this story, from the roots of mass production with the rise of fast food hamburger in the 50s, to the ubiquitous use of corn in feed and products, to overuse of antibiotics, to genetically modified seeds and corporate lawsuits that prosecute farmers harvesting their own non GMO seeds.  Not to mention that the fox is literally guarding the chicken house through a revolving door of lobbyists turned government administrators/regulators.  Cannot wait to see what this extraordinary filmmaker comes up with next.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Interesting turn of pen. I highlighted many phrases of description as they were poetically graphic and seemingly original.  I look forward to the movie.
0395389496|5.0|THIS IS WORTHY OF EVERY CALDECOTT MEDAL, THERE IS. EVEN IF A CHILD CAN'T READ, WITHOUT THE STORY, JUST PICTURES, THEY WOULD BE ENGROSSED. THE STORY IS ALSO A MASTERFUL TALE. THUMBS UP, VAN ALLSBURG!
B00457WZEI|5.0|This is a powerful short story originally written in 1982 for young readers. It was recently recc'd to me by a close relative, who like myself and maybe 90% of all female children, grew up with a fascination for horses. Black Beauty, Chincoteague and National Velvet and all the various genres and spin offs were and are some of our fondest reading and movie/TV joint recollections. Though published 20 years ago and though I was an Elementary school classroom teacher at the time, I did not come across the story until this very recent conversation, spurred by the upcoming local premiere of the stage touring troupe production with its innovative life-size puppetry. We then researched it. Apparently, it was developed through live interviews of some of the REAL people from WWI mentioned by name, Albert, himself, a villager and Captain Bludgett of the cavalry. The picture of Joey by the soldier is really in a museum. Still I had not read the book nor seen the Spielberg movie (even tho' THAT alone should have peaked my interest in 2011). Anyway, I immediately booked tickets to the stage production here in Rochester, NY for Nov. 2013. Then I ordered the kindle book version so I would be a somewhat enlightened theater goer. I was totally enamored with the book and found it captivating.<br />  The narrative style of the book, told primarily from the perspective and 'voice'  of the horse, Joey, was a wonderful vehicle to interest a child as well as an adult reader. As a children's book, some caution is necessary for a responsible educator or parent. Some 'scenes', even on the farms, are graphic and war is not a comfortable topic in any event. This book offers a unique opportunity to bring the gruesome reality and history of war and specifically, WW1 to the child audience to open understanding and time for conversation. The message is softened by the bond of loyalty, endurance and total unconditional love between the boy and horse that many kids can identify with, say that between them and their house pets. It also depicts the sadness of loss and death, something many kids are forced to learn to handle.  Friendship, kindness and sacrifice are part of the fabric of all our lives.<br />  The use of the animal as narrator was a major plus for me, to tell a heart-wrenching/ warming story with a strong anti-war message, in a style suited and familiar to children (think Charlotte's Web). Most of us, at any age, have never had a great understanding of WHY We Go To War at all and this is portrayed in the book, &#34;Ours is not to reason why, ours is but to do or die&#34;. To Joey, the farm and what 'his boy', Albert asked of him is answered by Joey's struggles to do what IS asked of him. This ethic carries on to his time in service to England's cavalry, Joey's 'communications' in a teacher/student role concerning how to cope with humans, war and relationships with the other war horses is symbolic of all our life's lessons. The war scenes are graphic, the fighting is frightening and chaotic -- a fluent statement about the insanity of the violence. Horse lovers may find it gruesome abuse, but it was reality.<br />  Obviously I cannot say enough good things about this book. As an English major, however, though padding an essay is often worth more grade points, eloquence is often about brevity, being terse and to the point. Think haiku and famous quotes. If this review were so... I would say in ONLY a brief and to the point comment, that; &#34;this book IS brief and to the point&#34;.
B00FKAA3MA|1.0|Eminem's early work is by far his best.  I will always listen to the first three major albums.

B00DJ80VLS|4.0|( I am revisiting my review as after initially being obsessed with the poor drum sound, I have found this album still appearing regularly on my playlist. The songs and compositions are strong and the final epic is now my favourite out of all their albums. The start of \\"Illumination theory\\" has echoes of Tchaikovsky's Piano concerto 1 with the opening notes which is woven through this magnificent over-the-top epic. It has everything including a moving orchestral interlude leading into Petrucci's most classically lyrical solo possibly ever. Stirring stuff. The more I listen the more my initial criticism is tempered. I have now altered this from a 3 to 4 star review.  I still agree though with my initial thinking which continues below.)<br /><br />This review focuses on the drum sound of the new Dream Theater album and compares the 5.1 audio mix with a previous DT 5.1 mix.  I do like the album but as there are hundreds of reviews that cover in detail each of the songs and general impressions, I have not included that here.<br /><br />I eagerly purchased the new Dream Theater deluxe version as once again they'd produced a 5.1 audio mix version. I still regularly listen to their \\"Systematic Chaos\\" 5.1 recording and marvel at the clarity and power. Paul Northfield had done a superb production job on capturing the brutal force of the rhythm section without losing the subtle nuances. So finally we had another to enjoy!  My initial excitement melted quickly as I listened to \\"False awakening\\". I flicked through my Marantz amp settings to ensure I hadn't made an error.  This is probably the worst drum sound I have heard on a DT album.  I was so looking forward to hearing Mangini louder and crisper in the mix. Yet the sound of the drums are completely muffled.<br /><br /> The more I listened, the more I noticed other things. No surprise but the definition to the bass was almost completely absent. Forget a 5.1 audio mix, I have CDs from the 90s that sound better.<br /><br />Then the pain sunk in, the bitter disappointment. You see I really like this album and believe it could have been one of their top 3 albums...but the cardboard, drum machine sound of the wonderful drumming of Mangini is so very disappointing in the recording. Now I am unsure if this is because of the mixing, mastering or initial recording. Whatever the reason, it's unacceptable for a 5.1 mix.<br /><br />When I listen to the album with my Grado headphones, the drum sound is perhaps acceptable. So are they mixing for the headphone generation? On my sound system ( Marantz player, Mission speakers and Velodyne sub) the power and definition of the recording is missing. If I compare \\"Systematic Chaos\\" 5.1 with this then you realise how different the recording of the drumming is. This is sterile and compressed. On \\"Systematic Chaos\\" 5.1 (which is my least fav DT album) the drumming physically knocks you with my Velodyne sub. The drum sound is varied, the snare and toms clearly distinguishable. On this new DT, I have to have the sound blaring on my headphones. And then they sound acceptable... I think Kevin Shirley got the warmest and punchiest drum sound on the LTE albums. (Listen to Simon Phillips' s drum recordings - these are nearly always impressive. Try Sherinian's \\"Oceana\\" opening track. That's a drum recording done right!)<br /><br />Hey, have any of you listeners got \\"Systematic Chaos\\" on 5.1? Do a simple comparison and you'll soon realise what a STUNNING recording it is. Listen to \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\" part 1. Go to about 4 .45 and listen to the build up of drumming. Listen to the attack of the snare, hear the tight kick drum and distinct different tom sounds. Even when the power wall of guitar comes in you can easily hear the snare and bass pedal. You can hear hi hat cymbals! Try \\"Repentance\\" and you hear every little drum nuance. Rim shots, ghosting, cymbal. This is what I anticipated for the new DT 5.1. I am now depressed. What a waste of opportunity! In comparison I now think the DT drum mix is poor. No offense, Mr Petrucci, you are one of rock's greats and your guitar sound on this IS wonderful, but I thought you wanted people to embrace Mike Mangini. How can we if we can't hear him properly! (Maybe someone stole his signature Pearl snare drum and replaced it with a cardboard replica?)<br /><br />Finally, all the other elements are in place. I love the packaging, the art work and even the lyrics. All of the compositions have grown on me and Petrucci's guitaring is more melodic and soaring than I can remember in a decade. After all I have written this is a strong album and I will live with the flawed drum sound.parison I now think the DT drum mix is poor.

0399159347|5.0|The book begins with a seemingly benign reference to Pandora's jar, (not box, as commonly believed). The idea is dropped almost immediately and is not resurrected again until the last sentence. Yet, the idea pervades the novel. Three families are impacted by secrets, clandestine relationships, and tragedies or traumatic events of one kind or another. Their stories are gracefully knitted together.<br /><br />Cecelia Fitzpatrick, comes upon a letter while searching in the attic for a piece of the Berlin Wall for her daughter Polly, the youngest of her three daughters. It is addressed to her by her husband, Will, in the event of his death. When she tells him about it, he pleads with her not to open it. He returns to Australia from America three days early, piquing her curiosity. When she awakens and hears him searching the attic, she knows she must read that letter. She believes he might have been confessing something, perhaps an affair.<br /><br />Tess O\\"Leary is married to Will. They have one child, Liam, and they are a very tight knit family which includes her cousin Felicity who is a very integral part of that whole. She shares their lives entirely. Tess, Felicity and Will are involved in a start-up marketing business. Tess and Felicity are like sisters. Felicity, however, once obese, is now quite thin and beautiful. One day, Tess's husband and her cousin approach her and ask her to hear their confession.<br /><br />Rachel is Janie's mother. Janie was murdered and the case was never solved. Her grief has crowded everything else out of her life. Although Rachel believes she knows who the murderer is, and has been harboring her hate toward him for thirty years, the police do not agree. She wants a confession from Connor, the man she believes had killed her child.<br /><br />In the end, each character, major and minor has his/her own secret and confession, of sorts, to acknowledge. Each one's secrets will have repercussions on their lives that will require some kind of response or reaction that they will be forced to bear. Still, many of the secrets surrounding them would remain in Pandora's jar until the end of time. The most confounding secrets of all will never be exposed, and yet, the consequences of Janie's death were far reaching. It is impossible to ever know what might have been if Janie had not died, how might all of their lives have differed.<br /><br />The story is about false assumptions and misconceptions which lead to equally false conclusions that we often act upon, impetuously, with dreadful consequences. Our superficial perception of people, i.e., men who are bald vs men who are losing their hair or blessed with a gorgeous mane of hair, impacts the way we see and judge them. People see what they want and believe that they are seeing things that might not actually be there. Eyes are a theme throughout the story; eyes and what they represent, reappear in the narrative. The eyes of these characters saw things through jaded eyes, confused eyes. They were used to describe their character. Janie said Jean Paul had beautiful eyes. Felicity, even when fat, had beautiful green, almond eyes. The sheriff and other moms and Rachel, think that Connor had evil eyes, gray serious eyes, that had hidden secrets behind them. Jean Paul cries, therefore, his eyes leak.<br /><br />The story is about the need for ultimate justice. It is about pride that forces us to do what we think is right even when we might be wrong. It is about the danger of keeping secrets and the reasons that secrets are kept in the first place. They are usually, after all, kept to hide reprehensible behavior or behavior we are ashamed of and want to keep private. It is about man's ultimate cruelty towards those we don't find measuring up to our own particular standards, and how we use them to make our own lives seem more palatable. It is about the moments we have all experienced, when anger rules our common sense, and if unchecked, can simply go too far. It isabout the need for vengeance to close up the wounds that never heal and the bitterness and emotional disaster that follows. All of the characters will have to come to terms with their grief and guilt, one way or another. All of their actions have impacted someone else because of their thoughtlessness, even when they thought they were being solicitous. Can they be forgiven for these sins, intentional or otherwise?<br /><br />Even though the book deals with some pretty heavy subjects, it is also written with a touch of humor, not laugh out loud humor, but it is certainly the chuckling kind, and these moments of tongue in cheek expressions make it easier to read.about the need for vengeance to close up the wounds that never heal and the bitterness and emotional disaster that follows.

B00BI489P0|1.0|I\\"m not sure what happened to the Kindle version, but it is not what was advertized. My first complaint is a lack of any table of contents. I didn't expect to be able to navigate to Act 2 Scene 3 of Henry V but I expected to be able to navigate to the play itself.<br /><br />The next major complaint is that It looks like this was just scraped from Project Gutenberg. I mean literally, there's formatting text after each section. This is actually unkind, After checking the Epub provided by Project Gutenberg I found no formatting text.<br /><br />The Lack of line numbers is annoying but understandable as a abandoning a modern convention. Except that in this case it wasn't an editing choice, it was laziness.<br /><br />As a further note that should be obvious by what I've already said there are no play introductions or notes.

B00IRMTTPU|5.0|Solomon Northrup ( Chiwetel Ejiofor) a free black man living in Saratoga, NY is conned into coming to Washington DC where he is taken captive and forced into slavery as part of a slave ring. The film, based on the book, shows the humiliating life Solomon had to endure as &#34;nothing but prized life stock.&#34; In spite of his skills and education he could not secure himself a position away from hard labor.<br /><br />The film depicts graphic beatings, plantation owners infidelity with the slaves, and or course white racist slave owners in a bad light. In a minor role, Paul Giamatti plays a slave trader and Brad Pitt a Canadian abolitionist living in the south.<br /><br />There is some singing in the film, the roots of spiritual gospel and the blues. It is clear that singing was done to maintain sanity and purpose in a hopeless situation.<br /><br />The acting was superb. The film is emotional. The only fault is that the title gives away the whole plot and ending which unfortunately was slightly anti-climatic ...funny how real life sometimes does that.<br /><br />Well worth seeing.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No F-bombs. Sex and nudity.

It's an absolutely amazing read and brings me to tears numerous times throughout the book.  I have numerous friends that serve and I don't believe there's a more selfless more admirable profession.  Each night I say a prayer thanking Marcus, Danny Dietz, Michael Murphy, and Matt Axelson and the countless others that keep us safe from these evil bastards hellbent on destroying everything that we hold dear.  I'm a high school teacher, and when Christmas break rolls around I'm going to suggest that they all go see this movie.  I get upset when some students refuse to do the Pledge of Allegiance or only do it half heartedly.  Those that take the time to go an see it, I'm just hoping that it stays true to the book, and knowing that Marcus was on the scene, I have a feeling that he made sure that it did.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Its great! I really like it! Spock is by far my favorite character! Uhura is a great character as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed reading this trilogy. The story goes beyond the sex and is a true love story. Those people who criticize by saying the story is unrealistic or idealistic are forgetting that the idea of fiction is to give the reader an escape from reality. Come off your high horse and just get involved and enjoy.
B003ZMF26W|4.0|so far so good got the software installed and its up and running, the feel is good and the wheel is so nice tons of buttons and options lights up in the front larger sized mouse for bigger hands and the cable uses a nice braided nylon casing over it i am liking it so far but this is day 1
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the entire trilogy and did not expect the story line to end the way it did. It was great though!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Every song on ARTPOP is amazing and deserves applause.<br /><br />If you listen to The Fame, The Fame Monster and Born This Way, it seems like three different persons are singing in those records, that quality is present in ARTPOP, where you could think each song is sung by a different person (the critics first noticed this on Applause when they said Gaga's vocals on the verses sound odd).<br /><br />ARTPOP could mean anything, in a simple way it means 'we could belong together', if you want the concept, ARTPOP is about putting art in the pop culture. In order to complete the ARTPOP experience you should try the app, where ARTPOP becomes more than just an album and the music turns into a comunication media with visuals.<br /><br />Track by Track:<br /><br />1. Aura. This song is so heavy and agressive at the verses and sweet and heavenly at the choruses. The hahahahahaha at the beginning is perhaps one of the most fascinating things about the song. ARTPOP is the result of the exchange between Auras, it makes sense to start the album with this in mind.<br /><br />2. Venus. The hooks in this song are so catchy and makes you wanna dance while screaming Venus. Gaga is been a musical producer since the beginning of her career and this is her first time doing it solo, the fact that this song is the catchiest on the album proves Gaga's music talent.<br /><br />3. G.U.Y. As this album is a music journey you can see the conection between Venus and G.U.Y. This galactic song is a feminist anthem for love, where Gaga tells woman can be strong enough to be in charge even if she's not on top. This song is so addictive that makes you wanna be that G.U.Y.<br /><br />4. Sexxx Dreams. The bass and the beat on this song is the sexiest thing on the album. And the way she uses her voice makes it even sexier. The verses are beyond and the chorus hooks you like a hooker. Fun fact: 'We're both convicted criminals of thought' was inspired by the sex dream of a Joanne Tratoria's chef with Gaga.<br /><br />5. Jewels n' Drugs. Three legends of rap and a queen, need i say more?<br /><br />6. MANiCURE. One of the most happy moments of the album. This song fills you with joy while Gaga sings about being addicted to a love and the only cure is the man she loves. The guitar solo at the end is one of the most special moments in the album.<br /><br />7. Do What U Want. The R&B track is one of the several highlights of the album, the beat is sick with Gaga's vocals blending perfectly together with R Kelly's. This song is the sword and shield of ARTPOP, if you harass the artist, all you are getting is an ass, you dont deserve the art anymore but do what you want with that ass. Great choice as second single.<br /><br />8. ARTPOP. This song is my favorite and is because of everything that compounds it. Vocally, The way Gaga decided to sing this song is unique and soon to be iconic, plus the HEEE HEE's are the perfect way to complete the melody. The three vocal lines at the song are what i call the perfect hybrid. And the music production of this track is really out of this world, galaxy, space and time. This song has a beat that relaxes and inspires you. This song is like gold (brilliant and beautiful) and really describes ARTPOP perfectly.<br /><br />9. Swine. The squealing synths of this song are hypnotic and mad and really great for dancing. And the way Gaga's vocals are mixed makes me thing this is the new thing (you know, when Cher released Believe, she refreshed and inovated pop music, making the Cher effect the new thing). The whole vocal mixing on ARTPOP is amazing and inovates, its between a robot and a human, so unofficially i call it The Hybrid to this new way to mix vocals that is present in the album.<br /><br />10. Donatella. The beat of this song is something magical and addictive. The agressive and the upper-class-princess tone is the signature voice of this song. The song represents a beautiful, strong and brilliant woman that society just look atlike a skinny blonde rich bitch. Donatella the person is beautiful and so is Donatella the song.<br /><br />11. Fashion! This Dance song feels fine and slays. The piano in this song is one of my favorite moments in the album. The voice Gaga uses for this song fits perfectly the theme of fashion. Being the fashion more than just what she wears, but something that saves and inspires her, this track is about the way you feel in your 'fashion' rather than how you look.<br /><br />12. Mary Jane Holland. The heavy production fights with the fragility of Gaga in this track making it one of the most addictives (the irony about the title). The special effects on this track and the agressive synths transport you to somewhere between a circus in the space and a bar at Amsterdam. Gaga's vocals are strong and fragile in this song as the music is kinda sad and utterly happy at the same time.<br /><br />13. Dope. The deepest song Gaga ever wrote and perhaps the saddest one too. Her vocals are raw, you can feel her sorrow and listen to her almost crying. The song sounds like it was made for a broadway musical or a movie. Even though the song is a piano ballad she pushed the boundaries of pop and added heavy synths to the strings, piano and organ arrangement. The song is after Mary Jane Holland, you can see why. This song is one of the best of ARTPOP.<br /><br />14. Gypsy. This song is the perfect connection between Dope and Applause. The song has a fast beat and a perfect transition from a piano arrangement to a hardcore dance production. And the acoustic guitars were the perfect choice for this song arrangement. This song is hardcore DancePop and a signature Gaga song (she's a gypsy).<br /><br />15. Applause. I love this song, and this song has become one of Gaga's greatest hits ever. This song is like nothing else in the album, the chopped synths and the bridge and transitions are amazing. This song shows Gaga's amazing vocal range in the choruses, in the backup vocals of the prechoruses and the WHooo whooO at the piano Bridge [hitting A above high C]. The structure of the chords each 4 bars is brilliant and the ultra fast beat is something that pushes pop music to new ways of thinking about how a song can be. This song is pure POP singing about ART. The fight between the two synths at the choruses [a breathy choral synth and a square electronic one] is like two Gaga's auras exchanging to create art (one is really sad and the other is so happy) and the chorus vocals are arranged in a perfect way to fit the auras of the synths. This song is utterly happy because its about the thing that makes Gaga and her fans happy the most, but you can feel a bit of sadness in that breathy synth maybe cause she wrote this song when she was unable to perform. I could go on forever with this track, lets keep it simple: Applause is amazing.<br /><br />My advice: This album was meant to be a journey so the best way to experience ARTPOP is listening to the whole album and trying the app for full experience.<br /><br />If you want me to chose my Top 5 (I still listen to the whole album cause i think is perfect and i love every song):<br />1 ARTPOP<br />2 Dope<br />3 Mary Jane Holland<br />4 Swine<br />5 Donatella
B00BUL0IHI|5.0|The songs did not Download all the way the album is good tho. The one star is because I did not get full tracks
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is really cool. I am always losing my clock so it seemed a natural choice to find an app to help me out. You can awake to different pre-recorded music or a buzzer. The numbers are large and easy to see in the dark. The numbers do go off after a set amount of time, which is a good thing because they really light up the room in the dark. The sound of the alarm can be adjusted. Worth the money.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|BRANDON SANDERSON has made magic with the the mind of Robert Jordan. I could not put this book down. I, like  lot of Wheel Of Time readers, have been reading and rereading this series since the 90`s.  Beautiful work.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Superb. I hope there is a second season. I really enjoy the lead actress and I want to know what happens to that character. It would interesting to watch the aftermath of the shocking ending.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Endless hours of fun.  Rated up to three stars per layout, so if you go too slow, you can go back and shoot for more stars.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|I expected more based on the cast.  What a fantastic cast!  Sadly, if you've seen the trailers, you've seen all the good scenes and it isn't difficult to guess how it ends.  It was eye candy, but lacking otherwise.
B00F0N30BS|2.0|This is a book about using graphic illustrations to communicate. It has scores of illustrations, most of them simple, many of them cute, all of them hand-drawn. The author wants to teach us how to use graphics and his copious use of graphics helps make the point. Unfortunately, however, the illustrations are printed in a book format that is too small. The physical size of the printed pages is 6 1/2 x 7 with wide margins whereas a more typical page size (a book grabbed at random from a stack on my desk) is 6 x 9. Everything about this book is too small, including the type font. The difficulty in reading the illustrations, many of which have short words and/or numbers packed into a small area around the graphic elements, distracts greatly from the flow of information. It actually had the effect on me of undermining the core idea of the book, that I should be communicating more through graphics. I propose rule #1 for graphic communications; graphics have to be easy to see and read if they are to have impact. The publisher (Penguin Group) and the author should be ashamed of themselves. The physical format they chose is oxymoronic relative to the subject matter and greatly diminishes the value of this book as a learning tool.

B00EUM5LJE|4.0|It is, of course, very well written, and I enjoy trying to scoop Sherlock Holmes on finding the clues. Of course, I am a complete failure; but that makes it more entertaining. There is always a surprise, and I like that at the end of an entertaining book.
B00ENZUUPI|5.0|I've waited a while for this and my expectations were high.  After hearing from Nicke Borg, I wondered where the \\"soul\\" was. I am a huge BB fan and was definitely jonesing for that kick.  This is it (sorry, Nicke).  Dregen delivers in a big way here.  Worth the wait? Definitely!  Although he's grooving with Michael Monroe, I've been missing his distinctive guitar sound.  It's here and more.<br />This is what a rock and roll record is supposed to sound like.  It's cohesive, fun and catchy.  Punk? Heavy Metal? Don't label or dismiss this one.<br />For all of the grunge/angst generation, this is so simple it's over your head.
1592537251|5.0|I actually bought this book at my local bookstore. I did so after downloading it and this is the only time I have ever done so. The book has various artists represented from around the world and they give hints and tips on how they do their craft.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Piece of junk. Another piece of privacy and freedom of choice disrespecting crap from the new evil on the block called Google. Forces you to install google chrome. Does not support internet explorer although it supports safari. Collects an unknown amount of information including usage, etc. That is if you are able to use it, say, to connect and play Netflix movies. I am not able to do that more than a couple of times for very short periods of time, and ended up dropping connections, unable to play movies. Nothing but youtube works reliably. Not only waste of your $35 but the time that you spend trying to set it up, etc. There are better options to do much more than this garbage with similar costs.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I had been telling everyone to read this series, and how AWESOME and addicting it was. I pre-ordered this book. I even paced myself so I could enjoy the end of this trilogy. STUPID!!!!!!!! There were so many ways to end this book. I don't know if Veronica Roth is some dark twisted and depressed person who wants us all to suffer with her, but if so she succeeded. I have been telling people not to read them because once your hooked your hooked but then...I read this book today and the ending was so terrible and depressing it was such a waste of a great story. You would be better off not to waste your time falling in love with this tale because it will all be shattered in the end. I don't say this often but I was truly disappointed and feel depressed after reading the last book as ridiculous as that sounds. It wrecked my day!!!! Screw you Veronica!!!!!

B0091THRCU|5.0|After three months use, I'm still happy with this case.<br /><br />It's incredibly lightweight and allows me to keep my iPhone 5 &#34;naked&#34; when not in the case. I initially expected the materials to break down over time, but they've held up nicely. To be fair, I don't subject the case to rough conditions; it primarily stays in my pocket.<br /><br />The magnet holding the pull-tab to the back of the case is a really nice touch for a product offered at such a low price.

B00DSO9RMC|3.0|As any new Terry Pratchett book, Raising Steam was one of my most anticipated books of 2013. And indeed the book started well, reminiscent of his previous book, The Truth, where a new technology is discovered in Ankh Morporck. We are introduced to the principal characters, old and new, and the stage is set for a rollicking ride through Discworld.<br /><br />Sadly though the ride was monotonous and dull as a, wait for it, railway journey through a kilometer long tunnel. Halfway through the book, I was beset with the fear that the momentum of the story would lead it nowhere in particular. Because I felt that the book reads more as a diary of accomplishments of the expansion of the Railway rather than a novel. Towards the end, my fears were, sadly, founded. it must be said, though that there are certain high points, and the tongue in cheek humour does indeed shine through in many instances.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is that there is no clear established antagonist in this book, which are a hallmark of Mr. Pratchett's books. For example, Mr de Worde in the Truth, Reacher Gilt in Going Postal, and Cosmo Lavish from Making Money etc. Also Vetinari's scenes in any Prachett book are a delight to read, full of subtlety and guile. But in Raising Steam he comes off as a total tyrant (and jackass). His dialogue so completely lacks the hallmarks of his character throughout the Discworld series that it makes me wonder if Cosmo Lavish did indeed replace him in Making Money.<br /><br />I am aware that producing novels of Mr. Prachett's quality is exceedingly difficult and an admirable one at that. His books have brought hours of entertainment and joy to me, which is why I can't help but feel a tad disappointed in Raising Steam.<br /><br />It's not to say this is a bad book, because god knows there are enough and more lesser talented writers out there on the best seller lists today. But for me it's not the same high standard of literary quality I expect from Mr. Pratchett. But having written 39 amazing, entertaining and vividly imaginative books I can readily forgive him for this one..

B00FQPHOPI|5.0|This movie takes you into a realm of Superman that is new, exciting, and not predictable. Well except for the fact that Superman always kicks arse. Not to the liking of comic book fans who want guide lines for the story to unfold the way they would have 50 years ago. However times change and a super story must be written to keep up. This movie does not fall short of inspiring us or keep us from cheering on the great super hero as he once again saves the world.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Damian Stevenson has captured all the elements of mystery, suspense, thrill and horror in Solstice. From the start, this author pulls you into to a read you begin to question if the main character, Dana, is crazy? delusional? Does she imagine those around her? Every page turned keeps you on the edge of your seat. Solstice is filled with twists and turns that make your heart pound.<br />I was impressed with this author's creation of an intriguing plot, believable characters and descriptive scenes.<br />Well done Damian!

0307271609|2.0|Some good news is that the author has dredged up some new material about Cixi not seen before in English, particularly as to the personal goings-on at the Ching Court.  The bad news is that her basic contention re. Cixi's accomplishments is,  if not inaccurate, a great distortion.  The author somehow assumes that the imperial court ruled China in a strongly centralized fashion just like their Communist successors--wrong.  Rather, the country was much more of a decentralized collaboration of local elites and centrally despatched administrators--a rather delicate balance which [as in other periods of dynastic collapse] would be disturbed in the nineteenth century.  The new factor in the mix  was Western imperialism which created and supplied new elites [militarist/Westernized officers; comprador/merchants] to compete.  None of this comes clear here, no doubt due to the same compilations on which the author has largely relied for Court backchat, the Ching-shih-lu.  The inevitable bias in this compilation is the traditional Chinese historical viewpoint [dating back to Han Dynasty historians]  that all history is motivated by the good and evil actions done by powerful people, usually at Court.  Not really different for this biography.
B00F1W1S1M|5.0|It's hard to add to what has been written already but I do want to point out my favorite feature.  I love playing with the camera angles on \\"Outcry\\" on the Bluray.  I can isolate on any of the band members or change to one of them when they are performing a segment that I particularly enjoy.  I haven't looked at the documentary yet so I can't comment on it.  I read one rating where someone said that the crowd seemed a small part of the show.  I agree and to some extent I like that.  While I do miss the 'electric' or pumped feeling, it does add tremendously to the quality of the sound of the show.  It looks to me like part of the cause of that is assigned seating?  Maybe that's by design.<br />EDIT:  I just noticed the comment about the drums sounding flat.  I have the show on Bluray and played through a lower to mid range 5.1 home theater and it sounds awesome to me.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Very simple story line. I think developing the backstory would have been much more entertaining than watching a &#34;coming of age&#34; in the future adventure flick. Did not hold my attention for the most part, looks like it was designed as a video game.
0316219266|5.0|\\"The Everything Store\\" was such an engaging and fascinating read, I inhaled it in less than 36 hours. (For the sake of my sleep and work schedule, I'm glad books like this don't come along too often.)<br /><br />As I write this review, Amazon just announced a partnership with the US Postal Service to start delivering on Sundays for Prime members in key cities. This backs up the best description I have heard of Amazon and its founder -- which, amusingly, comes from the blog of ex-Amazon employee Eugene Wei, someone who was not interviewed in this book.<br /><br />\\"Amazon has boundless ambition,\\" Wei writes. \\"It wants to eat global retail... there are very few people in technology and business who are what I'd call apex predators. Jeff [Bezos] is one of them, the most patient and intelligent one I've met in my life. An apex predator doesn't wake up one day and decide it is done hunting.\\"<br /><br />Stock valuation aside -- you either believe or you don't, and as of this writing Bezos is clearly having a messianic moment -- \\"The Everything Store\\" is an excellent chronicle of Amazon's rise.<br /><br />In the book -- and I don't mean this as a criticism -- Bezos comes off as the lead character in an Ayn Rand novel. A real world John Galt or Hank Rearden, with an e-commerce twist. The immigrant step-father who taught him the value of hard work... the maternal grandfather who instilled a deep do-it-yourself attitude... the flashes of extraordinary competitiveness from an early age... the burning desire to conquer space... it all coalesces into a sense of destiny (though, of course, a good portion of this could be narrative hindsight).<br /><br />Steve Jobs was the last great business figure, the hero entrepreneur of our time. I think that, reputationally, Bezos will ultimately surpass Jobs -- leave him in the dust, really -- because while, what Bezos is doing is unsexy, the fundamental nature of \\"hard problems\\" that Amazon approaches and solves (on its way to eating global retail) is adding to the free market knowledge base at a tremendous evolutionary rate.<br /><br />One of the most intriguing and powerful things about Amazon, in my opinion, is the sheer logistical prowess of what they do behind the scenes. The coordination of supply chains, manpower, algorithmic decision making, and countless other unseen problems they have had to solve on the way to delivering \\"everything\\" in a two-day shipping window is off-the-charts impressive.<br /><br />To a certain degree Apple accomplished a similar behind-the-scenes feat, in that Apple's masterful ability to implement and coordinate global supply chains made it the most profitable company in the world for a time. But Apple's breathtaking profit margins always had a slightly ephemeral feel to them. You knew that someone (like Samsung or Google's Android) would eventually come along and take a bite of the Apple so to speak... whereas with Bezos' strategy, staking out the hard, grinding, low-nutrient territory of thin margins, the next competitor is going to have to get bloody in the toughest octagon of all (logistics and scale). As Bezos likes to say, \\"Your margin is my opportunity,\\" which should scare the hell out of any large retailer, perhaps save Wal-Mart (and maybe even Wal-Mart too).<br /><br />Those who doubt Amazon's business model (myself among them in the past) have been prone to use the \\"switch flip\\" criticism, e.g. bullish investors assume Amazon will one day be able to \\"flip a switch\\" and become profitable. But I agree with Eugene Wei that this is an overly simplistic characterization of a more subtle process. In reality, Amazon is less like a company with one switch to flip and more like one with tens of thousands of individual switches, each of which can be incrementally adjusted to swing from loss to profit when the time is right. This seems far less fantastical when you picture thousands upon thousands of instances where, say, a 2% margin mark-up creates profit where previously there was break-even, and/or a simple slowdown in the prodigious rate of ongoing capital expenditure spending lets more cash flow spill over into the profit column.<br /><br />As for the prodigious capital expenditures, Amazon's most recent quarterly revenue figure, as of this writing, was roughly $17 billion. Bezos no doubt foresees the day when that quarterly number will hit $100 billion. On the way there, it only makes sense for him to exploit every inch of leeway he can get from Wall Street -- in terms of taking all the money and opportunity he can for long-term investment -- with the goal of scaling up the infrastructure to serve and support an order-of-magnitude larger sales base. If investors get loopy with their valuation assessments in the meantime, so be it. The vision is the thing for Bezos... just as it has always been.<br /><br />But getting back to \\"The Everything Store,\\" my favorite thing about this book was the brutally honest nature of the flaws and the messiness of Amazon's evolution (and the evolution of Bezos himself) in the first 5-10 years or so of the company's existence.<br /><br />Through an excellent weave of facts, narrative anecdotes and storytelling, you get a clear picture of how Amazon surged out of the gate in the late 1990s, and then almost choked to death on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bad acquisitions it made with \\"bubble money.\\" Many dumb mistakes were made, some deservedly fatal... but Amazon survived them all, and managed to learn from them too.<br /><br />The evolution of Bezos as a CEO is fully apparent as well. While those who ponder Bezos today are likely to assume he stepped on the world's stage as a wise genius fully formed, in actuality he picked up many of his strong core beliefs along the course of Amazon's existence, learning through intense study of rivals and mentors from afar, like D.E. Shaw (early on) and Sam Walton and Jim Sinegal of Costco.<br /><br />The book is really a gift for entrepeneurs and business builders of the new generation -- like myself, ahem cough cough -- in the manner it lays bare the luck, the guts, and the serious mistakes that are inevitably made on the way to forming a world-class enterprise.<br /><br />The other thing that really came through is the sheer ruthlessness of Bezos. (No doubt this is what got Mackenzie Bezos riled up -- what spouse wants to see their husband portrayed as a tyrant?) But as the book points out, there is a reason why so many of the great builders in tech -- Gates, Ellison, Jobs and so on -- all had that same ruthless character to them. Building and scaling a world-dominating business is hard. As in really, really hard. When you are trying do something on that kind of scale, with that level of competitiveness, you are not just fighting against cut-throat competitors. You are also fighting against entropy and mediocrity, that pull of ordinary results, ordinary outcome (as opposed to extraordinary) that holds back every ambitious endeavor in the same manner the NASA shuttle is held back by gravity. It takes something special to get off the launching pad, let alone into orbit.<br /><br />The fact that Bezos can be extremely ruthless, even cold-blooded, in pursuit of his vision, will not gain extra points with much of his audience. (No doubt a reason Amazon itself wants to tone that side down.) But investors should be glad for this trait, and it's a trait that benefits capitalism on the whole too. When a strong player legitimately uses skill and efficiency to best a weaker player in the marketplace, costs are lowered as such that customers benefit, and other businesses can learn from the strong player's pioneering example.<br /><br />The final chapters of the book showed Amazon at its most ruthless by far. I had no idea the level of wargame strategy that had occurred in the purchase of Zappos. The Quidsi (diapers.com) acquisition was simultaneously even more brilliant and brutal. You do not, not, not want to be in head-to-head competition with Amazon. It is here where I stop and whisper a small prayer of thanks to the free market gods that my own career path does not involve selling commodity-type retail products.<br /><br />I had reason to examine my own motives as to why I enjoyed this book so much. I am a trader, not a retailer. While I have plans to lead and scale a business to large (perhaps even very large) size, it has nothing to do with traditional retail really. So why was this book so fascinating? Perhaps for the sheer cultural value of what Bezos represents and what he has accomplished. Here is a guy who started out smart, talented and exceptionally bold, and had the chutzpah to act on a wildly ambitious vision and see it through every step of the way. Learning and stumbling as he went, sometimes screwing up royally, but always pulling in the errors and coming back from the brink... having laid the architecture more than a dozen years ago to sustain a vision ten times bigger (or maybe even 100 times).<br /><br />The broader inspirational lesson from the Amazon story, I think, is the reaffirmation of what's possible when motivated dreamers decide to work harder, work smarter, and break traditional molds all at the same time. You really can execute on a compelling vision. You really can get a team together and, with the help of that team, accomplish a hundred or a thousand times more than you ever could running solo. You really can practice patience and boldness -- no coincidence \\"bold\\" is one of Bezos' favorite words -- and in so doing apply an Art-of-War like strategic nous to flanking and beating your rivals. Big and exciting things can be done in this world.nd business builders of the new generation -- like myself, ahem cough cough -- in the manner it lays bare the luck, the guts, and the serious mistakes that are inevitably made on the way to forming a world-class enterprise.<br /><br />The other thing that really came through is the sheer ruthlessness of Bezos. (No doubt this is what got Mackenzie Bezos riled up -- what spouse wants to see their husband portrayed as a tyrant?) But as the book points out, there is a reason why so many of the great builders in tech -- Gates, Ellison, Jobs and so on -- all had that same ruthless character to them. Building and scaling a world-dominating business is hard. As in really, really hard. When you are trying do something on that kind of scale, with that level of competitiveness, you are not just fighting against cut-throat competitors. You are also fighting against entropy and mediocrity, that pull of ordinary results, ordinary outcome (as opposed to extraordinary) that holds back every ambitious endeavor in the same manner the NASA shuttle is held back by gravity. It takes something special to get off the launching pad, let alone into orbit.<br /><br />The fact that Bezos can be extremely ruthless, even cold-blooded, in pursuit of his vision, will not gain extra points with much of his audience. (No doubt a reason Amazon itself wants to tone that side down.) But investors should be glad for this trait, and it's a trait that benefits capitalism on the whole too. When a strong player legitimately uses skill and efficiency to best a weaker player in the marketplace, costs are lowered as such that customers benefit, and other businesses can learn from the strong player's pioneering example.<br /><br />The final chapters of the book showed Amazon at its most ruthless by far. I had no idea the level of wargame strategy that had occurred in the purchase of Zappos. The Quidsi (diapers.com) acquisition was simultaneously even more brilliant and brutal. You do not, not, not want to be in head-to-head competition with Amazon. It is here where I stop and whisper a small prayer of thanks to the free market gods that my own career path does not involve selling commodity-type retail products.<br /><br />I had reason to examine my own motives as to why I enjoyed this book so much. I am a trader, not a retailer. While I have plans to lead and scale a business to large (perhaps even very large) size, it has nothing to do with traditional retail really. So why was this book so fascinating? Perhaps for the sheer cultural value of what Bezos represents and what he has accomplished. Here is a guy who started out smart, talented and exceptionally bold, and had the chutzpah to act on a wildly ambitious vision and see it through every step of the way.

B0055B7K7A|4.0|A sweet story and engaging for adults as well as kids. I've seen it twice now and it is still entertaining.
1742204120|2.0|NOTE: Unlike the other reviewers for this book, who are from \\"Amazon Vine Program\\" where they get free sample of the product, I am a genuine person of interest in a good travel guide book for my visit to India.<br /><br />As far as i can tell, this book is not all that great like other free sampler reviews here seem to indicate. Go to a brick and mortar store to check it out and compare with other travel guides to india. Or better yet talk to a person that actually went to India with this Nov 2013 edition to decide if this book deserves a 5 star or 1 star. In general avoid considering reviews from the Amazon Vine program. Google \\"Amazon Vine\\" to learn for yourself how those reviews are rarely neutral.<br /><br />Happy traveling.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This was a gift for my 6 year old nephew who loves trains.  I purchased it along with the Polar Express train set.  The gift was a huge success.  I watched the movie on Amazon streaming so I could talk to my nephew about the story.  The story and animation are top notch.
B001BANK32|5.0|I didn't read the book when Stephen King published it, I just went to the movie. But If you read his sequel, Doctor Sleep, then you are going to need to read the Shining. I read it and was in awe with the story. The movie was great, the book is better. The two are different.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|My Klipsche iGroove SXT ([[ASIN:B002O3W3Y2 Klipsch iGroove SXT 30 Pin Speaker]] would not charge my iPod.  This handy device solves that problem.  Sound is not impaired in any way when using this.  This converter/pass through was more expensive than some other selections, but worth it to me.  It would make no sense to have a nice dock and then compromise the sound with a cheap adapter.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Great Fun and Free. (The exact same app on my Windows 8 computer or Windows 8 phone would have cost $1.99, each). Which do you think is the better deal? Well, I think this is the better deal, and wish Micro Soft good luck.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I really enjoy reading Ken Follett and have read nearly every book he's ever written.  I was rather disappointed by this book however and was surprised in particular by the character interaction which is just too contrived -- their stories weave in completely impossible ways.  Its a difficult task to intertwine the depth and breadth of WWI with a cohesive and engaging story line but this felt too thin.  At times I thought the writing was not quite up to par in comparison to other novels he's written.  I will continue on with the next book in the trilogy and hope it's better than the first.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Got this as a present for my fiance, and she absolutely loves it!  This thing is pretty basic, but it does all of the stuff you want it to.  You can hold the call button to bring up Siri on your iPhone (And the Android equivalent I assume, I don't have an Android phone so I can't test this), it makes pretty clear calls for a device with a price this low, and it has an impressive range.  If left on this thing will easily pop up as an option to route audio, even if the phone is at the opposite end of the house from the driveway.<br /><br />Having owned several much more expensive bluetooth speakerphones, I think the next time I am in need of one, I am just going to pick up one of these, or whatever the model that replaces this one will be.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|The watch works, but I have real problems with it.  First of all, the bezel is a problem.  I thought I would believe the reviews saying the bezel was fine, but I disagree.  How can you have a watch that goes crazy and doesn't work when it starts to get sweat on it?  I know you can lock the bezel, but you had better not try to unlock it.  In the middle of the summer, I can try to wipe my hands dry, unlock the bezel, and use it, and it will still take off into strange settings.  If I set the sensitivity to the low setting, it will take a very long time to respond to my touch.  I used my watch as a pacer in a half marathon the other day, and I forgot to lock the bezel.  It was fine for the first 6 miles.  After that, something activated the bezel, and I couldn't get my watch back to normal until I was back in my car and a mile down the road.  From now on, I cannot depend on this watch unlocked.  That is frustrating, because the light is activated by touching the bezel.  I get up early and run in the dark.  I can't see the watch at all.  I tried setting the light to come on for status changes, so I'd at least be able to see the time periodically.  If I set the lap timer, I was able to get light whenever the laps changed.  However, the lap message stays on the face of the watch so long that I can't read the time on the watch until the light goes off.  So if you always run during the day, no problem.  Don't buy the watch expecting to use the light.  And don't run without the bezel locked.  You'll just have to figure out what settings you want on the watch and don't expect to change them during a run.  For the most part, I just use the watch to record my runs, and I review the data later.  I do use the interval training, but you have to learn the beeps.  The other morning, traffic noise kept me from hearing a beep telling me the interval had finished.  I got completely off on my run and rest intervals, because I couldn't read the watch to know which one I should be on.  Soin general, I use the watch for the interval beeps and to record my runs for later review.  I've asked Garmin support for their thoughts, and they have not given me any advice to help me with these problems.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I didn't know what I would think about this game, it looked like a game that I would hate but I ended up really enjoying it!<br /><br />The story is charming and intriguing, the characters are hilarious and likable, and even though I have no idea what is being said, the music is great too.<br /><br />The plot is fun and interesting, and all of the interactions and side quests when you aren't in the dungeon are all fun as heck.  The actual dungeon crawling aspect was probably my least favorite part, but at least the layout and theme changes which keeps it interesting.<br /><br />Even if you aren't a fan of jRPG's, you should give this game a try.  It might be the best game on the Vita at the moment!
B00BV0FK58|5.0|Practical steps  that can be done for positive results.easy to read.can easily relate to the case studies that were used.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen, things changed and I waited to see where the story was taking me.
0307352153|4.0|I was drawn to this book because I am an introvert myself, and I wanted to see what type of \\"powers\\" I posses. This book far exceeded my expectations. Such a fabulous read! Normally I don't go for \\"self-help\\" reads (which this book wasn't, not really) but I made an exception for this because it intrigued me so much!<br /><br />It was very easy to read and had lots of clever anecdotes, it gave lots of tips for how to work well with extroverts and vice versa. In fact, this book is also a great read for extroverts because it lets you into the mind of your introverted friends and co-workers! A very insightful and informative book. Well deserving of the Goodread's Choice Award for best non-fiction book last year!<br /><br />I received this book for free from Waterbrook Press in return for my honest, unbiased opinion.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|It is a wonderfully told story, with brilliant actors/actresses, in an interesting setting in India.  Loved everything about it.  Great film.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I suggest people take the time to analyze this story. You'll be entertained for sure. I've read it twice and am still finding things to digest.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the Calculator Plus Free App. I use it for balancing my checkbook frequently, and the kiddos grab the Kindle Fire and put it to use as a homework helper. I like how the memory allows you to leave and come back later, which is also great for busy moms. Universal for the entire family, with large buttons that even our 7 year old daughter can navigate. I'd recommend this handy free app to anyone and everyone.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Really interesting historical read. Well-drawn  characters and plot. Puts you right in medieval England and gives a you a god understanding of life in this time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's great.  But how do you access it and play once you download.  I had no problems downloading but only played once and unable to find or play.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Despite awful reviews, I enjoyed the ending. It wasn't &#34;the perfect ending&#34;, which I found more believable. Not my favorite of the trilogy, but it worked.
B0089K7DGW|3.0|This is an amazing show, but I was very disappointed in the condition it came in. The top part of the box set had a piece of the plastic broken, and the outer disposable plastic wrapping was also already opened for some reason. I'm not sure if this was the carelessness of the USPS, for they are the ones to deliver it, or if it was shipped this way by Upton and Sons. Though, I must say that when I had a question about the shipping estimate Upton and Sons was very prompt in responding to my e-mail. Overall I'd say get better shipping because it seems USPS is not very careful with their packages.
B000MZHW40|1.0|It was the wrong zone for New Zealand. In the past you have always sent the correct zone for us
B007IXWL2C|5.0|WHAT A GREAT WAY TO END THIS SERIES. I WANTED TO READ THE BOOKS BEFORE THE MOVIE CAME OUT AND NOW I'M ALL CAUGHT UP. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK JAMES!
B000LE16VW|5.0|I am a Patriack Swayze fan and this movie just put the icing on the cake.  It is one of the best love stories I have seen.  I wanted it in my archives, so when i'm older I can watch. it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Super fantastic, the best things since sliced bread. That means a lot coming from someone that REALLY LIKES toast. I do wish more apps would come out (HBO GO and so on). Otherwise a perfect complement to the traditional chord cutters life.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I had a hard time remembering who each character was - with the exception of the teen-aged boy, they all blended together as little people with big egos!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I'm still trying to figure out all of the options but it does seem to help speed things up by clearing out memory that isn't being used.
B007IK44CK|4.0|This is the best yet of the Mission Impossible movies. I read criticism that Cruise made his Ethan Hunt character Too Serious in this one; not so! There's plenty of humor in this movie, which was a risk, being an action movie, but it totally works ( this was our third viewing of it ). All the characters are well cast here, with Simon Pegg being a standout for the humor.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Awesome. So much better than the movie. Made me cry at points but... don't know what else to say. A great read
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I have really enjoyed this series .I really hate for it to end.  BUT with every ending is a new beginning. I certainly hope there will be more for the rest of the of them. Thank you Jennifer for the wonderful world you created .Until we meet again Adien and Alex.
B008Y212PI|3.0|This is really a five star game but I can't give it five stars because regardless of the fact that you pay for it they make you write a review in order to unlock the bonus. So that's why I am here writing this.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is a masterpiece of film work and acting.  The story is phenomenal, and one of the best translations of a Stephen King work!  This is one of those special films you can watch over and over and never get tired or bored and always leave wanting more.  It is put together and directed so well, I can't fault it for anything.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|An enjoyable little mental game. Look forward to more levels. Not too challenging that you get frustrated but just difficult enough that you want to figure each room out.
B001AQT0ZO|5.0|K, so the price is awesome for blue-ray. Great movie, one of my favorites. love it love it love it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a game that really keeps on entertaining. I hope to see more games of this caliber in the future.
B0040I09RM|5.0|A change of pace series for me.  I can't stop watching this series.  Managed 2 seasons in one day.  If I didn't have to sleep, I'd of stayed up to see how many more seasons I can watch in one day.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I gave this trilogy 5 stars because there have been very few books I couldn't put down.  I was drawn deeply into the plot and characters from the moment I started reading the first page.  The characters and their world come to vibrant life on the pages.  I look forward to more wonderful reads in the future.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Taken with all the rest, an amazing series. It is a bit dark but the author does very good world building. I would highly recomend not starting with this book as the author does not coddle with past stuff and jumps right back with each book.
B008MLNDEO|5.0|This is definitely one of my top 5 favorite sound tracks.  If you are trying to decide between this and the remake of the sound track choose this one.  I
0385535147|2.0|I found this book to be rather dull. I'm a big fan of most John Grisham books but this one just didn't work for me. I kept waiting for it to get better. I finally quit reading it about half way through, and I don't usually quit reading books.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Exterior: The real dimensions of this battery pack are 5.22\\" tall x 2.75\\" wide x .475\\" thick with nicely chamfered edges. This makes the pack really pleasant to handle and the surface, while slightly plasticy, has enough texture to keep it from slipping or showing too many scratches. Overall, this is a very solid piece of electronics.<br /><br />Function: I have used this to charge the following devices: iphone (5S, 5, and 4S), HTC One, Nexus 7 (new and old), Jambox, and Logitech Mobile Boombox. On every one of these devices except for the Nexus 7, they charged at full AC speeds. The Nexus 7 is capable of drawing 2.1A from an appropriate source, but with this it is only supposed to receive 1A. This battery pack was sufficient to charge my Nexus 7 (which has a very large battery) from completely flat to full while using the tablet. On a positive note, if you have the Blurex Case for the Nexus 7 ([[ASIN:B00ECDL5AK B00ECDL5AK]] this battery pack will fit in the handstrap and you can use them together easily.<br /><br />The connected micro-usb cord is indispensable. It keeps you from having to carry any extra cords with you. This is great because this battery pack fits great in the opposite pants pocket from your phone (in men's jeans).<br /><br />It has the capacity to refill my iphone 4 several times and is a great battery pack to have.
B0073RQMBY|5.0|These dinosaurs are so neat and heavy duty. My daughter loves them. Totally recommend, I will be getting more soon.
B0058SNI58|4.0|These are really comfy to wear all day long.  They're so lightweight, you pretty much forget you're wearing shoes.  They also go with everything.
B007B8H97Q|5.0|I admire the forgotten language of etiquette, chivalry, and unconditional love. Every episode also has an essential mix of scandal. Here on the West coast of the U.S., Downton Abbey is a refreshing program from the trite shows of American television.
B00GIZO674|5.0|I played this when it first came out on computer. It's fast paced as the levels get harder, but I finished it, so it's not impossible. You pick your upgrades to help you along and try to keep your customers happy..all in all, if you like cooking games you should like this, now all we need is Burger Shop 2 which was even better .
B00FCAK12A|5.0|I love it when bands go back and remaster an earlier album, especially when something so perfect is held back by sub-par production.<br /><br />To be clear, I should first declare that I am a pretty big audiophile, so clarity and good production are big issues for me. However, When I first heard the original version of this album, I listened to it over and over, even though it sounded muffled and somewhat muddy. Now, hearing it in its full potential is beyond amazing.<br /><br />The best analogy I can think of is this: Remember when HDTV first came out, and you watched football in full HD, and couldn't believe how much you were missing before? That is what the jump from the old mix to this one feels like.<br /><br />Overall, the clarity is sharper, but not by too much. The largest improvement is the bass guitar/drum mix is much more powerful. For example in the song Ruin, the drum solo and the riff that follows hit a lot harder. In vigil, there are notes that I swear I hadn't heard before that add to the eerie effect the song has.<br /><br />I have been waiting for a remaster of this album for a long time, and now that it is here, I can tell you it has been well worth the wait.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Really like this game especially the gopher shots!!  Just the right amount of .  difficulty to keep it interesting.  Kindle version did not allow me to enter my player name like the Apple iPad version does.
0553801473|5.0|i love this series of books and i hope there are  more coming besides being able to see how it has been transformed into an excellent program on HBO.  Martin's book are outstanding and i can bearly put them down.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This a well written book about this kid who is the last hope of the human race, in a society where kids are now trained for military leadership. The kids are put under pressure to perform.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|outstanding british program that you will absolutely get hooked on.  always on the leading edge of programs, this is another excellent britsh program with substance, drama, great story line and some of my favorite brit actors and actresses.  money well spent all the way around.

B004K4AVAG|5.0|who doesn't love lady gaga?  all the songs are great and has a flow that sucks you into the music.  i keep listening to it over and over to get all the lines down!  love it.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I started watching this series a long time ago, but stopped, thinking it lacked. In a moment of boredom, I revisited it and quickly got sucked in. The chemistry of the actors works well, the writing and stories are great. I couldn't believe that I let this pass me by the first time around.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Where's the new update??? Every month there is supposed to be an update. WHAT??? The new Orleans edition is terrible!!<br /> Would give 5 stars, but that really bugged me.
B00FQPHA0M|5.0|It was really nice to see a reboot of this movie with modern movie special effects.  I hope the series continues.  If you have the opportunity see it in 3D I highly recommend that, but it is a good movie nonetheless.  They definitely got the right actors for both hero and villain.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun. This game can frustrate you to no end but addictive & you just have to get to the next level!
B00AQA0OJG|5.0|amazing figure she looks really beautiful with my other figures!!! I am really happy with how she looks vary nice size to!! her hair face every thing is awesome looks just like asuna 5/5
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is by far the best book I've ever read. It's beautifully written and is just a beautiful story all together. It's beautifully heartbreaking and makes you want more and more. The heartbreak is perfectly balanced by the love in the story, and I would highly recommend this story to anyone looking for a good, tearful read.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|Gilbert's writing style richly paints a world we've never before visited, and the scope of the main character's life is wide reaching. The last third of the book loses steam, though, and by the end, we're left with a shrug and a yawn.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|These young men, with their exceptional voices, are so outstanding.  I could listen to them all day in whatever language they sing in.  Their English is improving and this Christmas album is a joy.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|Slow to start but that doesn't last long. The art is good and whimsical. Awesome. I cannot put it down.
158234082X|3.0|Hard to believe, but amid all his braggadocio (pirate crew; phone sex; drugs ad nauseum), he never mentions the AIDs epidemic.  Makes me wonder how honest all of this bombast is.  It's spectacle all right, so where's the reality?
B0086700CM|2.0|More for kids / teens than adults.  It's a 'chase game' with all the action confined to taps or swipes to get your character to run, jump, slide, or whatever.  Visuals are good, but the 'action' gets boring really quick.  Basically, it's a 'quick reaction/decision' game.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|A quick, fast way of searching the internet. Nothing beats Google.  It has so many sites covered. I  LOVE it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game. Keeps you busy and had lots of levels. Never a dull moment. Would recommend to my friends
B00006JIA4|5.0|Has every thing you ever wanted from Queen. All their hits that you know and love. If it's not here it isn't worth having.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Characters are so cute. Downloaded on my kindle for grandson. Not to happy about prices for the coins. He<br />loves the game though.
1439156816|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend (it was on her wish list), she really enjoyed it and I enjoyed hearing about it from her.  She is a beginning writer and they shared the same philosophy on writing.  We watched a biography on Stephen King on tv shortly after she read it.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|This wasn't quite as good as Monsters Inc but it was close. I liked it a lot and feel that people at any age might enjoy it too.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I got what I expected from \\"S. King\\". With tesion and curiosity to the next, this book was clapping me all the time. The material for this novel and developing the story was excellent. Words and idioms were also interesting to me. I enjoyed it!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie had everything... action, explosions, aliens, gods, humor. Hulk Smash!! I loved what Hulk did to Loki. Was the highlight of an already awesome film.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I enjoy that you have the ability to choose a harder way of dismissing your alarm before I used to sleep in much more than I do now and I also love how it tells you how much longer until it goes off that makes me be sure it will go off and I can track how much sleep I will get.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Loved the Transformers, Especially Shockwave, who was always my favorite growing up.. just glad they didn't make him a giant purple space gun lol. Shia Lebouf wasn't very good in this though... think that the script writers were really running out of things for him to do with this one.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its a great game u have to get this!! its really fun to play and great for the little kids
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|The book was interesting but I wasn't blown away by it. Nothing new to me and I guess I expected something different.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A brilliant novel.  Terrifying but moving.  When we laugh at the North Koreans crying hysterically when the &#34;Dear Leader&#34; dies we had no idea of the horrors of the ordinary North Korean's life.  If they don't cry in front of the cameras, God help them.
0804137501|2.0|The 37signals \\"books\\" are not really that, more of a glorified series of half-baked thoughts. This one in particular reads like a sales pitch. Avoid.
B004H83IM8|5.0|Love it! A super affordable must for all Austin Powers fans!! This series is fun and quirky! If you love irreverent humor then you need this DVD!
0893860468|5.0|Great book if you are into spirituality. If you have been meditating, this book makes a lot more sense. Otherwise find a practice that suits you and get started on the inner journey.
B00005N6KG|1.0|EDIT: When I first bought these headphones about a year and a half ago, they cost me about $8, which was the reason for my gleaming review. For the price, they were excellent. One side broke recently and I was disappointed to see the ridiculous price hike. They are great running headphones, but NOT for the price of $50+. They are relatively flimsy and not meant to handle anything past low-impact use; I never even touched the jack aside for plugging it into my ipod and took very good care of them and one side still died after less than two years. Now, for the original price, all of these faults are not a problem, but seeing as some of these are selling for $65, there are much higher quality options than these, as they will not last. Disappointed in Sony.<br /><br />As an avid runner I absolutely love these. Ear buds just haven't cut it despite the various types I've run through, but these are easily adjustable and stay in relatively well. I've had no major issues with them in the past year that I've had them; my only gripe is that the cord is indeed too short as others have said but while running it's only a mild nuisance for myself. I've read some reviews of people complaining that they run through multiple pairs because one or both sides stop working; for what you're paying you should assume that these are not high quality headphones; if you're stuffing them in an out of backpacks/bags on a constant basis they'll probably go bad. I personally use them only for running and use regular ear buds for listening to music at school, work, etc to avoid jamming them up and they've worked perfectly for the past year. All in all, for the price and comfort while running, I can't recommend a better pair of headphones.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|The boys are back in business. This is a great product to have in your Supernatural collection. It was a great season.

B00E9ZATJO|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Monsters University is where creatures go when they want to be instructed on the fine art of scaring the bejesus out of unsuspecting tykes lying all snug in their beds at night. Yet, while many aspire to such a career, few are called. And no one wants to learn to be a first-class scarer more than little Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a short, green, one-eyed, retainer-wearing, utterly nondescript blob-with-limbs who frankly couldn't scare a bed sheet on Halloween. And it doesn't help that his greatest competition in the school's annual scare-off is a hulking furry brute by the name of  Sulley (John Goodman) who comes from a long line of scarers. But in the great opposites-attract tradition, Mike and Sulley soon learn that they can achieve more by working together than working apart. This is particularly the case after they join a fraternity made up of other wanna-be scarers who are determined to win the contest against a half-a-dozen other teams of more reliably frightening monsters.<br /><br />\\"Monsters University\\" may not be as emotionally resonant or cerebral as some previous PIXAR productions, but this prequel to the 2001 mega-hit \\"Monsters, Inc.,\\" is one of the most purely enjoyable films ever to come out of that studio - and that is saying a great deal indeed. It has terrific fun parodying the rituals of college life - fraternities, cliques, the high-pressured stress of exams - yet still manages to relate to the younger set's concerns with the need to be accepted by the \\"in\\" crowd while at the same time finding the inner strength to remain an individual and to stand up for oneself and all the other misfits in society (think of this as a monster-sized riff on \\"Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer\\").<br /><br />As this is a PIXAR release, it's practically superfluous to praise the wit and ingenuity of the script (by Daniel Gerson, Robert L. Baird and director Dan Scanlon), the beauty of the animation with its gorgeous collegiate-gothic backgrounds, and the spot-on voiceover work that have long been the hallmarks of that studio's output. The all-star cast includes, in addition to Crystal and Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Sean Hayes, Helen Mirren, Aubrey Plaza, John Kraskinski, Bonnie Hunt, Bill Hader, and a whole lot more.<br /><br />So sit back, relax and enjoy the delicious treat that is \\"Monsters University.\\" But don't forget to pull the covers up at night.and the spot-on voiceover work that have long been the hallmarks of that studio's output.

B009LOJK1Q|4.0|I was apprehensive, a sequel to one of the greatest horror novels of all time? I think not- a bit like Mike Tyson making a comeback. However I was not only pleasantly surprised but captivated by the book, The True Knot were villains of the highest order and Rose truly frightening...nice one Mr King!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it. Very challenging.I recommend it to anybody.Super super fun and time consuming. Can't stop playing.It is very addictive!
B00CPLGGXM|4.0|Very good graphics. Windows 8.1 the graphics are amazing in games . Better then windows 8. More detail<br /><br /> It runs hot as heck, cant use it in mini itx case it runs so hot, uses over 260w at full load also peaks at 260w spontaneously just serfing the web  and the lowest average 35w but peaks at 255w a lot for a few seconds just scolling the mouse over things. I beleave it has to do with the graphics. where a intel chip the power seems more controlled but its hard to tell since the intel chip is so much lower wattage even if it peaks to full load its allmost unnoticeable  and does it much faster so what takes seconds with the AMD takes nano seconds with the intel<br /><br />I just built 4 new computers mini itx. 3 intel and one AMD. First before i say anything yes the graphics are amazing. The issue i have is with a mini itx motherboard and case. This processor runs way to hot. I upgraded the heatsink to artic cooler, it helped a little. But this processor throws of so much heat using in a mini itx case does not work . AMD specs say working temp up to 70 well it went up to 98 for me and froze up 2 times had to manually turn of . That's when i purchased the artic cooler heat sink. And it goes over 200w at full load. HD video decoding in windows media center not as sharp as intel i3-4130T in windows 8.1, though the AMD is much better for games. If your not gaming there is no piont to use this AMD procesor unless you need a heater or like throwing away money on eletric bill. For simple buisness computer and or a mom and pop computer for going online and doing simple tasks AMD and intel makes lower power procesors for that<br /><br />compared to a Intel Core i3-4130T a 35w top power usage. Peaks at 45w with 3 hard drives installed and 7 USB devices conected and playing a game.  But on average surfing the web just 18w. I use this in 3 builds in a mini itx case with 80w power supply. No heat i mean no heat. Its lots faster then this AMD processor, its so quiet i find myself looking at the case lights to see if the computer is on it on and am able to play command and conquer generals at only 25% to 35% cpu usage at around 15w. I tried with bf3 but the intel graphics not good enough playable frame rate at 1080p HD the intel will play bf3  at lower resulutions like 1440 with all graphics turned down no problem. remember This is for the lowest 4 thread \\" 2 cores with hyper threading\\" total 4 cores show up in windows desktop processor available a Core i3-4130T. normal 55w and up intel chips play better for there graphics are clocked faster. Also if your intrested in low power. i also built a 17w intel celoron. its motherboard cpu combo by gigabyte and to be honest with single thread apps / programs like internet explorer its fast faster then this AMD though not for power hungry programs but as for its graphics dont even try to play a bf3 or any modern game, as for mediacenter it worked fine with 6 Full HD tuner no problem and even plays amazon HD videos no problem HD though at high cpu usage around 70%+ still only 12w to do that gigabyte  GA-C1007UN-D its also 1600mhz memory capable<br /><br />If you looking for a mini itx build in a super small case i wouldn't / cant  use this processor it gets to hot will over heat. Unless you not using its onboard graphics. It does run coller if used with a graphics card. But them why use this chip there are better AMD processors for less money for that<br /><br />If for some reason you want a cpu gpu in one with good graphics then this AMD is ok but i think there is better with a 35w intel and a small graphics card would blow this chip away.<br /><br />I will say one thing the graphics in the game never looked so good and i do have 2 gtx 6800 in my large computer. But i haven't tried them in 8 pr 8.1 yet just this AMD.<br /><br />Save the planet AMD lower your wattage . the only good thing i could think of at the time of texting this processor was it helped heat the room up.<br /><br />Ok I was going to use it for my media center with HD tuners because of the good graphics with a power supply on side of case to power it. Until i can find something better. but it just runs to hot and uses to much power and the HD video worse then Intel so i Think i just going to use the intel with a gtx680 since its winter and the gtx680 puts out heat like the AMD . Lol. No i trying for low power as low as possible Save the planet and all that stuff. so going to use the Intel. I was hopping the fm2+ but looks like from what info i can find on the web the same power :( so probably the same heat :(<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE<br />The Core i3GA-C1007UN-D ( a 35w max processor ) and a geforce gtx 680 uses a little more power but is much more capable then AMD processor setup.<br /><br />Any one tell you i a intel fanboy.  no way i started 35 years ago integrating AMD  graphics  onto IBM motherboards and have always used AMD graphics cards till just recently and still would if i wasn't on saving the planet bandwagon. With low power computers.<br /><br />i know simple physics cant be change. The more power the chip uses the more heat it throws off.  This AMD chip is very good for what it is, IF NOT THE BEST ! is a very good low cost alternative<br /><br />Just don't plan on using a mini itx case with a 80 or 150w power supply and or no ventilation . Intel best for that and i still say the intel faster a specially if you using a SSD. All the new intel boards are about 20% faster with the sata controllers even the 17w low power Celeron gigabyte i3GA-C1007UN-D works descent for a low powered windows media center setup. though playing full HD is about 70% but remember it only pulling 17w max cpu

B00C5R7B0I|5.0|This book is Patricia Cornwell at her finest in pulling in her readers attention.<br /><br />From the beginning when Scarpetta has just returned from a horrific shooting in Connecticut, which continues to haunt her, to a phone call from Marino concerning a shooting and the mysterious person in her back yard.  Who is he and what does he want?<br />All of the main characters are in this book: from Benton with his extraordinary profiling skill at getting in touch with the minds of a murderer to Marino who has returned back to his usual gruff talking machismo strutting cop ways then on to Lucy with her defiant attitude towards authority and rules to Scarpetta with her unquestionable ability to help solve murders through forensics and add in Bryce, Scarpetta's admin, who provides just the right touch of humor and you have the makings for a powerful must read book.<br /><br />I could not put this book down until I finished it.  Now, I will reread it for some of the finer points that I may have missed the first time.
B00BSBR9N6|3.0|An enjoyable book, with like able characters and a good insight into Asperger's syndrome. Easy to read, humorous and and light.
0307476073|1.0|Yes, I have read \\"Wild\\" and yes, it is good writing, as writing goes. But it is a serious danger to any who would ever attempt to emulate what Ms. Strayed attempted. In fact, I strongly suggest that her book has opened a Pandora's Box of foolish and dangerous regard for wilderness backpacking. And yes, I have hiked the Pacific Crest Trail, twice. I have also been backpacking into most the major mountains within the United States and since \\"Wild\\" has been published and found an enormous audience of wanabes with as minimal or less experience as Ms. Strayed, the trails are awash with irresponsible behaviors, hikers with little to no wilderness etiquette, people who believe because they just spent $1000.00 on camping equipment at their local REI are now experts on being in the mountains. Of course I am delighted that more people are experiencing and enjoying the out-of-doors. However, Ms. Strayed's own lack of experience and foolish disregard for basic camping knowledge nearly got herself killed; and had it not been for a series of Trail Angels and pure dumb luck, she would not have survived to even write her book. So, I am among that small group of folks who do not celebrate her best selling book. I think it is a dangerous book that gives a sense of permission to people who have no business being on the Pacific Crest Trail no matter how expensive their equipment or determined their attitudes. In the fifty plus years I have been backpacking, in the past two summers that I have been on the PCT, I have never encountered such a large number of individuals who were a hair's breath away from disaster. I blame that on \\"Wild\\".
0740748475|5.0|Beautiful collection in beautiful binding. This will stay in my family for years, hopefully for generations. It's a wonderful way to memorialize something that was so important to my childhood.<br /><br />From comments I have read, the paperback version of this collection has some quality issues. Get this version instead. Its sturdy and gorgeous. Like me.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Enjoyed how it bounced back and forth between Tris and Tobias.  Didn't see how it could end but it did and well. It's always hard when a good story stops, but I can see how these characters will continue on to live their lives.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I'm a late jumper onto the Angry Birds bandwagon, having just downloaded my first game (Star Wars II) last week.  That opened the door to what's become a bit of an addiction.  Simply put, this game (and I suspect the entire series) is an easy one to pick up and play for a few minutes, but don't be surprised when those few minutes turn into hours!  The gameplay is simple to learn (I got 3 stars in almost every level of the first section and still surprise myself on some new levels) but challenging to master (some levels have proven difficult to get past 1 star).<br /><br />There's not much else to say, so I'll do a quick break-down:<br /><br />Gameplay: 5 stars--easy to pick up, hard to master, at its core it's repetitive yet every level presents a new twist to keep you trying.  At its heart this is a physics-based game, and the levels include a variety of regular gravity (characters and objects fall to the ground), weightlessness (characters and objects travel in a straight path only as far as inertia carries them), and gravity fields (characters and items are pulled towards the core/planet at increasing speeds).<br /><br />Graphics: 5 stars--simple, and what may be expected for a modern smartphone/tablet based game--not overly pixelated, and suitable for the game.  Some of the crossovers between bird/pig and Star Wars characters are amusing.<br /><br />Sounds: 4 stars--the Star Wars music and effects are great-sounding!  That said the repeated sounds will get annoying after the 15th try at completing a level or earning more than 1 star.<br /><br />Controls: 4.5 stars--it can get frustrating on occasion when an attempt to scroll the screen results in a bird toss into oblivion.  It is also hard to discern the exact effect physics will have on your bird (for example, I'm still trying to figure out how to master Leia's ability).  The simple graphical instructions complement the easy-to-learn style, but offer little insight into how to best utilize each protagonist's abilities.  Trial and error, or blind luck, is the only way to overcome such a simplified control scheme.ilities.  Trial and error, or blind luck, is the only way to overcome such a simplified control scheme.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved reading Divergent and Insurgent! So when I heard Allegiant came out I was very excited! Now after reading it part of new wishes that I hadn't. I was very disappointed with the story and feel like  it could have been done better.<br /><br />WARNING SPOILERS BELOW!<br /><br />I don't like series where  in the later books they start to write pov's for other characters. You've grown used to Tris point of view so sometimes during this story I've had to stop and ask myself  \\"Is this Tris or is this Tobias?\\" It may have been easier to understand if they had done it in all  of the<br /> books.<br /><br />The main reason I loathed this book was because of the ending. Though I did see it coming it still angered me.  When Tris died there was no moment where  I thought \\"Yeah her death made sense\\" because really it didn't.  I didn't feel content with the ending or in any way satisfied. If anything it made me feel unsettled about the whole thing. One person wrote that Tris could have been weakened by the bullets and death serum causing her to be vulnerable to the memory serum causing her to forget everything. Then two years later it could talk about how similar  or different she was after losing her memories. That I could understand but in my opinion was the wrong way to go.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I started to watch this movie and sat through a five minute nude scene. What a way to start a movie. Denzel Washington is a superb actor but because of the first scene, I felt someone was trying to sell me something not entertain me-I shut it off.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Should be able to play as long as you want. Maybe has gliches wrong wit it. Wish it worked better.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Really bad zombie story. Not you usual zombie. They are fast but only when the story needs it then they turn slow. Oh yes and disease is the winner. Disease the people and vaccinate them and they are invisable to zombie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The tension in this drama pops.  I can not wait to get to Season 2.  If you are looking for a show that is about the law, lawyering, law firms then this is not for you.  If you are looking for twists and turns and people-stuff Suits Season 1 has it.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I chose this rating because of the previews on tv and then when I received the DVD and played it for the first time I knew that this was a winner that I would enjoy to replay especially the twist ending.  I can't go into the movie to much without revealing to much of the plot.
B00DYEN5QU|4.0|To start off i grew up on superman and loved his comics even more. The movie was fantastic maybe some of the fight scenes went a little to long but they were still very good. It keeps true to the superman orgins and gives it a little bit more darkness to the story. cavil plays a great superman(i'm still more into Reeves but cavil rocked too.) michael Shanon was a very good and very dark Zod and thought he played the role to a tee. I felt every one did a great job except maybe amy adams as lois. i have nothing agianst adams and most of the time enjoy her acting but she just didnt sell me on the lois lane role. but i'm sure others might disagree.<br /><br />Now about the 3D. I have written a lot of 3d reviews and i do love that style. man of steel however is what most would call a mixed bag. now to all those who saw man of steel in the theater like myself probably came out thinking this was a lackluster 3d movie and i 100% agree with them. However the 3d blu ray release has gone pardon the pun \\"leaps and bounds\\" better than the theater 3d experirence. It is still kind of lack luster comopared to how it could have been. The depth is way better on 3d blu ray and there are about 5-8 pop outs i can remeber and most happen pretty quickly. The only thing that makes me sad on the 3d area is that with the story,lay out and with all the cgi they used they could have made a big time 3d experince that would have made avatar look like amauter hour.But the kept the 3d in the reserve area. so in other words, did they use 3d in the movie and have it shown..Yes is it as good as it could have been...far from.<br /><br />The movie is a 4.5/5<br /><br />the audio is a 5/5<br /><br />the 3d is a 3.75/5 to a 4/5<br /><br />Overall a great movie. fans of the dark knight series/superman or comics in general will probably like the movie. I gave it 4 stars cause everything was there for me to like except i wish they would have pushed the 3d a bit more cuase they could have the 3d in this movie go from average to one of the best 3d experinces you could bring home. either way it is a great movie and i highly recommend it.

B00FF03K0M|5.0|There are lots of diff versions of this album depending on how and where you get it. Mine has six extra tracks on a separate CD although the text on the back cover doesn't indicate this. No matter really, except that it does make you wonder which one is the 'real' album, the standard version I suppose.<br /><br />There's a lot of debate about The Big Picture these days, with Bernie Taupin saying it's EJ's worst album. Whatever the ultimate verdict on that, there's little debate that Elton's been on a peerless hot streak since Songs From The West Coast, even if the sales haven't always been what they should.<br /><br />The Diving Board, even though it doesn't include any of his older band members, is one of Elton's best ever LPs.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|My kids laughed a lot during the show.  Six year olds loved this show.  This is a very enjoyable family movie.
0525953728|5.0|I loved this book. I give this book 5 stars because it was full of rich detail. The book had me sucked in so much that I could not put it down. Another reason why I enjoyed this book so much was because it was about our military and what they did to kill the terrorist who took away so many innocent life's of our American Heroes. I recommend you read this book because it gives you a glimpse of what actually happens out side of our country and also how our Militaries heroes help keep us free everyday.

B00FIUO8MI|5.0|Any book that makes you feel, that elicits emotion, in my opinion, is a book worth reading.  Was it my ideal conclusion,no. But that's ok. It doesn't have to be. For me it didn't discount the series.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The puzzles are pretty, fun and interesting. It is good that they allow you to increase the amount of pieces you can play, allowing everyone in the family to play. However, I have had to delete and reload the app on my Kindle H D X three times so far, just to be able to continue playing it at all.  After playing it for 5 or 6 games it gets slower and slower u until it just stops altogether.  Very frustrating.  If you don't mind reloading every 6 games, it's fun.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Dexter was once a great television show. It peaked around season 4 and has been downhill since then. Honestly, don't even waste your time with this season. It's laughable how far this show has fallen. One word describes how terrible the ending is - Lumberjack.
B0079LJZG8|2.0|It had an AMAZING cast. But was painfully slow, I usually enjoy a slow spy movie. But it was dry. And honestly as a mom of little ones. I am still having a problem getting the image of the mom getting shot in the head while nursing her baby. That being the main violence in the show....wish I could get my money back.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady Gaga is BACK with vengeance! This album is made of raw blood, heart and hard work. ARTPOP takes you on an exhilarating journey of sex, love, drugs, self-confidence/pride, and fun. Some tracks are executed perfectly and vocally, besides Dope, is her best yet.<br /><br />Aura is the perfect opener for the album. It immensely captivates you and it tells you a story about a side of Gaga's that no one has yet to know or discover. The chorus is catchy. Aura also shares that Gaga has \\"killed her former friend\\" which obviously means the BTW (or any other era) Gaga.<br /><br />Venus is self-produced by Gaga and is very unique. It has a good hook and chorus and after a few listens, it will get stuck in your head. Some may say its quirkiness or weirdness makes it the next Bad Romance but I disagree. While it is fun to sing and/or dance along to, it is not a single material.<br /><br />G.U.Y. is just flat-out AMAZING. It has the perfect intro and throughout the song, you just craves to be that \\"girl under you\\" (or guy whether your gender is). Definitely single material.<br /><br />Sexxx Dreams is clever and groovy with that 80's feel. It's super sensual. I'm not sure how this would work as a single if released.<br /><br />Jewels N' Drugs is a different sound for Gaga. It's Hip Hop with Trap/EDM. It's good but unfortunately, the live version from the iTunes festival is better. The studio version should've kept that DJWS breakdown.<br /><br />MANiCURE has a rock with EDM/dub-step feel to it. It is extremely catchy and contains the usual repetition/stuttering with \\"ma\\", like the ones we heard in Poker Face, Marry The Night, etc. This is a definite single.<br /><br />Do What U Want is the perfect second single for ARTPOP. It features R. Kelly and this is very R&B.  It has double meanings, sex and self-empowerement, not caring what anybody else thinks of you when you do certain things. Hopefully, this will be MASSIVE.<br /><br />ARTPOP is perfectly placed in the middle of the album. It creates a harmony between the halves of the album. The beat and structure is a little reminiscent of Selena Gomez's \\"Love You Like A Love Song\\" but it is definitely different and the lyrics are strongly written. My ARTPOP could mean anything...<br /><br />Swine. Abysmal. I have nothing to say about it. The beat might make people go crazy but yuck. It's the only track that I skip from this album. Tea, Temple, or Brooklyn Nights should've been in this song's place on the album instead.<br /><br />Dontaella is quirky and funny. It's cute and reminds us of Fame Gaga.<br /><br />Fashion! is a throwback to the past with feels of David Bowie and Madonna. While most do not think this is strong, I think this can stand strong by itself. will.i.am and David Guetta impressed me with this one. I can see this getting played in clothing retailers for YEARS to come.<br /><br />Mary Jane Hollard is the perfect stoners' anthem. I've listened to this when I was stoned and I was just completely in my own world. It also sounds like a rehash of the Heavy Metal Lover but even better!<br /><br />Dope is the standoffish track due to the fact that it is the technically the only ballad on the album. It takes time to grow on you and when it grows on you, you'll realize that it's beautiful and heartfelt. Although, I really do not like the line, \\"I need you more than dope\\". It can't relate to it as I am not a former addict/druggie. but I do still understand the context of the meaning,<br /><br />Gypsy is a STAND OUT track. It starts off as a ballad but then escalates to a BIG ballad with dance beats. This should be the third single. I absolutely LOVE this and I am confident that the GP (general public) will too.<br /><br />Applause is the perfect closer and as the first single because truthfully, this album is experimental and does not have much singles or radio potential.<br /><br />MY PICKS FOR THE NEXT SINGLES:<br />1. Applause<br />2. Do What U Want<br />3. Gypsy<br />4. G.U.Y.<br />5. MANiCURE<br /><br />6. Venus? (We all know Gaga wants to release this song so bad so why not close the era with this one? Or maybe 5 singles will be enough since Gaga has mentioned that there is possibly a second volume to ARTPOP).

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a awesome game you can do anything you want build. And the multiplayer is great to including realms
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Even though this game allows you to buy stuff, you dont have to. This is one of the few games where you dont have to use money to keep playing. It is one of a kind and super fun!
B007EC27QM|4.0|Nice little calculator. Has split screen capabilities. Decent user interface. I didn't notice anything great that puts it above the built in calculator though.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|In a good book you don't make the main character die in the end. That is the absolute worst way to end a book. But other than that the series was awesome.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I liked the inside thinking of the women characters, especially how they handle all the guilt women tend the feel. The need to do the right thing and make others happy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is not only a great writer and storyteller but he reminded me of the legacy all southerns inherited.  I am from the South by way of Ireland and Louisana and Texas and have no doubt that this is a story that happened many times.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Have always though Patrick Swazey was a hunk.  He died way too soon.  He is very sexie in this movie.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|Gaps in the steady sounds (i.e., white noise, brown noise), and discernible loops in the others, like rain, waves, crickets, etc.  I've found that &#34;Simply Noise&#34; is the best, no-nonsense white-noise app out there, but I don't seem to be able to get it on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My dragons are so beautiful. I feel so proud when they learn to fly. It's so exciting. I am so happy so far with this game.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|The plot is something a 7 year-old would dream up playing with his Transformers. The acting is absolutely putrid. The robots were the stars of the show, but this makes the first Transformers movie look like a Oscar winner for Best Picture. I have no idea why people liked this movie.
B00E9A656K|5.0|This game is awesome. So you start off with cars to choose from that later on you can upgrade and customize. Once you get enough money you can buy these awesome cars that loom amazing. One thing that needs change is that tyre should be more customizations like a rim job, headlight, plate covers, window color, and custom designs for your car's to make your own logo. Just allowing you to just change the color, decoy, and license plate is great but if these features are added that I listed the game will be great
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|While mildly entertaining as a rental, this is not a movie that bears repeat watching. None of the charm from the first two movies is present, and the entire plot seems forced.
B003B96AOW|5.0|cool piece to add to my collection hard to find in stores and cost more if i had found it else were thanks
B00BAXFECK|2.0|This 800 page book is one of the most cumbersome, tedious, boring books that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. For someone who has nothing to say, why take 800 pages to say it. Ms. Tartt says at the end of her book that the message of her story is that life is short and we better enjoy it while we can. How funny to say that in an 800 page book that goes no where and says nothing.<br />I really wanted to like this book. It did not start badly. The story of Theo is interesting...for a while. And then it goes off the rails. Theo is (along with his buddies) an egocentric, drug addicted, alcoholic, dishonest human being. He has absolutely no good quality about him and yet we are asked to care about his story. Why? Because he stole a painting that is valuable? Really?<br />I do not want to spoil any of the story for anyone. The reviews of others go into the story and frankly, I am so bored by the story that I do not want to write about it. But I will say this...The Goldfinch has received rave reviews. I don't get it.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|A completely guilty pleasure of a movie.  Preposterous story, marginal acting, however some nice explosions...and what other movie has a power-sliding battleship in it?!?
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|Stanley Kubrick's interpretation of Nabokov's novel \\"Lolita\\" strayed so far from the original that Nabokov immediately disowned it.  Over four decades later, \\"Lolita\\" was re-made, starring Jeremy Irons and faithful to the novel -- and it was almost impossible to watch.  Movies too loyal to the original novels are hard to watch in general, but the truth of the matter is that neither \\"Lolita\\" and \\"The Great Gatsy\\" were very good novels to begin with.<br /><br />\\"The Great Gatsy\\" is a novel that everyone had to endure in high school, as high school teachers love it for its bloated metaphors, vast imagery, and empty symbolism.  The main character is Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire who dreamed himself a fantastical life to pursue the woman of his dreams, but the real protagonist is Nick Carraway who straddles West Egg and East Egg, old money and new money, and finds himself disgusted and disillusioned by both, but strangely drawn to Gatsby.<br /><br />This new film adaptation of the novel is both carelessly unfaithful and zealously loyal to the novel.  On one hand, the movie is too extravagant, so great is the exaggeration of America's Jazz Age that the movie feels campy.  On the other hand, the movie follows the main plot of the novel, which is neither interesting nor clever.<br /><br />That said, both Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan offer excellent performances, and are each in their own distinctive way charismatic on the screen.  Unfortunately, the real disappointment is Leonardo DiCaprio, who has recently played a string of larger than life characters -- Howard Hughes and Jay Edgar Hoover, for example -- but in being asked to play the greatest larger than life character of them all he offers a meek and understated performance.<br /><br />The film's main failing is that there's no chemistry at all between DiCaprio and Mulligan, and we're left wondering why the two are attracted to each other in the first place.  Mulligan is listless and lazy, stupid and careless-- and we just don't understand how someone so devoid of charm and personality can enter into DiCaprio's heart until it consumes his being.  It's endearing that a man who is constantly re-inventing himself and living in a castle in the sky could be so utterly devoted to a mundane woman so that he's left sweaty and speechless in front of her -- but it's just not believable.<br /><br />The movie is like Gatsby himself -- unsure of himself, sweating and grasping for that ephemeral green light that may or may not exist across the harbor.
1594489505|5.0|i chose this book after reading his previous book, the kite runner.  i am knee deep into reading it and it is great! the book was in wonderful condition! thank you!
B008JFUR10|2.0|There are a few good battle scenes in \\"Pacific Rim\\":  Honestly, who doesn't like to see giant lizards wrestle against giant robots?  But other than these battle scenes there's nothing more to the movie:  It is an idiotic firm, horribly directed and horribly acted, and completely forgettable.
B003UBTX6S|1.0|I loved Beautiful Creatures and couldn't even put it down. This book is a total snore fest!!!  I have tried and tried to continue reading it in hopes that it will get better.  Have made it half way through the book now and have to stop. It's terrible and boring.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|My first Neil Young CD and after listening to it, my favorite Neil Young CD. Songs that very relaxing to listen to.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A fun game that can be challenging and irritating all at the same time.  Some easier levels after particularly tougher levels keep you from going insane. A keeper of a game.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|its a great app and I hope to see soundcloud go above and beyond the standards they have set out for them now
B009X2CUYA|5.0|Wonderful reading. Quirky, honest, entertaining and intriguing. A pleasure to read. I am now a Kate Morton fan for sure.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|This is a good story and you are never quite sure where the story is heading.  Evocative imagery and fast paced.  Gets hard to put down in the second half so be warned...
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|I enjoy spending time with this game.  It is challenging and the colors make it fun and light. Sometimes it is easy and sometimes not , and I like that about  a game. Thanks.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It was difficult to understand why this book had to be so sexually explicit and sadistic.  Not being intimidated by the scenarios, but certainly put off by them, I continued to read to see if there was a redeeming factor involved and also because the story is very well-written.  When the text wasn't clobbering my sense of propriety it was enjoyable because it did such a good job of describing the characters and developing the vicissitudes of the relationship.  Being a psychologist myself, I was captured by the dynamics behind Grey's sadism and inability to carry on a relationship on a deeper level.  When this didn't happen in Book I, I decided to read Book 2 (and then, eventually, Book 3).  I'm glad I did.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It was no secret that I would review Allegiant after having read the first two novels in this series. Divergent and Insurgent were both five star reads and I eagerly jumped into Allegiant upon their completion. Allegiant takes a different style and faces different challenges but kept with the same captivating style that keeps you racing for more. All in all, however, this novel is rated as FOUR STAR read.<br /> Again, Allegiant picks up right where the last book, Insurgent, left off. Tris is outside of the city heading to a destination unknown. They eventually meet up with the bureau of genetics and that is where things start to heat up. Instantly there is conflict and you find yourself not only in Tris' mind but also Tobias'. At first I was weary of this back and forth perspective because the authors style of writing is the same for both minds and it was occasionally confusing as to who I was reading from. However, by the end of the novel it becomes quite obvious why this method of writing suited the author. I won't tell you why, you'll have to read it yourself and find out ;)<br />There are a few new villains now that Janine has been defeated. Conflict rises in the city and outside as well. Tris is left with monstrous decisions and Tobias tries his hardest as well to keep up and find his own ways of supporting their efforts. I found that within this novel there was too much conflict between Tris and Tobias, my two newest favourite characters within the novel. I found myself frusturated that they just couldn't smile and make up quicker than they do.<br />I won't spoil anything within this novel but I will say that it is an emotional roller coaster as the author has no issues introducing new characters throughout the series only to have them die off eventually. You come to love some of the lost characters and mourn for them through your tears (or at least I did ;)<br />So my two obvious favourite characters are Tris and Tobias, the stories main characters. But other than that, I found that I related a lot to Cara.<br />It's strange to see people you don't know well in the morning, with sleepy eyes and pillow creases in their cheeks; to know that Christina is cheerful in the morning, and Peter wakes up with his hair perfectly flat, but Cara communicates only through a series of grunts, inching her way, limb by limb, toward coffee.<br />The main reason this novel lost a star is due to the fact that: (1) The back and forth between Tris' perspective and Tobias' was hard to follow at times because the writing style never differed, and (2) I didn't like the ending all that much. I could come up with a few different endings that would have satisfied me more. That being said, all in all, it was still an amazing read. Slower than the first two books, but just as interesting.<br />My Faction<br />At the end of this book was a faction quiz. So like every other Divergent fan out there I took that quiz. I figured I should share my results with the readers of my blog. The quiz is a short seven question multiple choice quiz and at the end of the quiz my results show that I would be a Erudite. That should have been obvious since I am a book nerd ;)<br /><br />You can find the quiz through an online search also :)<br /><br />~The Schwartz Reviewsthan that, I found that I related a lot to Cara.<br />It's strange to see people you don't know well in the morning, with sleepy eyes and pillow creases in their cheeks; to know that Christina is cheerful in the morning, and Peter wakes up with his hair perfectly flat, but Cara communicates only through a series of grunts, inching her way, limb by limb, toward coffee.<br />The main reason this novel lost a star is due to the fact that: (1) The back and forth between Tris' perspective and Tobias' was hard to follow at times because the writing style never differed, and (2) I didn't like the ending all that much.
