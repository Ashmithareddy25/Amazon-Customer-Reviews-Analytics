B005LAIGSC|5.0|Denzel dekivers again!Ryan Rnolds finally gives a serious performance and does a good job at it, I was al ittle surprised at the end though.
0385534639|4.0|While I was hoping for more development between 2 of the major characters (without giving too much away) details of the circus and plot were very well done and keep you wanting to learn more.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Enjoyed the game, but it froze my tab. Music played, but screen was black and none of the buttons would function.  Removed it and reinstalled it, but the issue returned. As such, I<br /> had no choice but to remove it for good, which is a shame as i would have liked to finish the game.
B007MJSSCY|3.0|This is a good family movie. The plot is intriguing and keeps one reasonably attached, and would be great for family viewing and stimulating discussion afterwards. It is not a great movie, but could have been. The greatest weaknesses? I didn't find either the portrayal of WWII England or 18th century England to be wholly realistic. From the start, there are clues that test one's temporal and historical placing disbelief. Suspense is mostly lacking where it could have played a decisive role in carrying the movie. Some characters are too matter of fact about the paranormal goings on. The script could have been adjusted greatly to make this more believable. Having voiced these criticisms, I don't think the director or producers intended this to be an edge of the seat movie. There is a strong element of MasterPiece theatre in this though the production standards are mostly higher than MP. I do recommend the movie if time travel interests you, and again state this is an excellent movie for a family with children to watch. Adults might be somewhat less satisfied.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is the perfect, and most acurate weather app j have ever used. i especialy like the feature where on kjndle it will alert u if there is a warning, ir just the weather. if u like weather, or just wanna c if u need a coat or umbrella, buh this FRES app. u wont regret it.

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addicting! I never get tired of this game! this game should not be free. it is worth like $100,000! but those monkeys scare the crap out of me:( scary!
B006OCM0G0|1.0|this game has no point u also have to download gems tovdo anything at $4.99 for gems is horrible!!! don't buy this app
0345803485|5.0|This book is an easy read and fun. Find a day when you have time on your hands and need to releive the bordom.  Get into a comfortable chair, get a cool glass of somthing good, send the kids to grandmas, and read this interesting book.  When I was young this was the book you wrapped in a paper bag.  Don't let your mother or the nuns at school know what you are reading.  Its that kind of book and it is fun.  You find yourself talking to the book.  Its up to you just what you say.  By the end of the day you want book two.  I am waiting for my copy. Have a great day and enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|so when I play it I feel so wart but in a way no also it was ok. the game make me mad sometimes so I think I will try to be nice to it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. I like this game because it keeps you playing for hours. I got this game when it was free and it would have been worth it if I would have payed for it. This game is great and I hope that other levels get added.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a pretty fun game.I think you should try it out. most people would like it. it passes the time
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Bag it is a fun and addicting game the whole family will love!!There are many different levels where it keeps the game fresh.Everyone should try it!!
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|There are no instructions for minigames. Some items are labeled incorrectly. Some are invisible (not transparent). Nav buttons rarely work. It is mildly entertaining, but not great.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app; especially the audio function. I can put down my Kindle and just listen. Very comforting. Also having the many versions makes it so versatile. Love this app!
B007MU85D0|3.0|I have worked my way through this record a couple times.  While not all that terrible, I am having a hard time finding anything incredibly distinct about it.  I keep muttering comparisons to other bands, such as: \\"Oh, this sounds just like Arcade Fire.\\"  \\"That is just like that part from that Mumford & Sons song.\\"  \\"This hook sounds like Fleet Foxes.\\"<br /><br />I like all of these bands (exception: Mumford & Sons), but this record seems like a bland mix of all of them, and not terribly original.<br /><br />That being said, it is pretty tuneful, and I like having it on in the background.
B0086700CM|5.0|When I first got this game I could not stop playing it. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants the rummest game ever!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is great for the Kindle.  I love it!  It very simple and reminds me more of Pioneer Trail on Facebook not Oregon Trail but it a great game.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|When you first download it you like it for a while, then it gets boring.I mean like what kind game is that, first you like it then you don't. Anyways this game is old, so if you don't like it why did you download it in the first place?<br /><br />WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game I've ever played.its maybe the best game in right now.almost every one I know have it
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is the best version and best acting performances of all of the \\"Jane Eyre\\" movies that I've seen.  Lead actress is fantastic in this role, but she's not plain at all, she's beautiful.
0307887448|5.0|This is an excellent novel. I think you should read it.  It was great.  Really great. I told some friends to read it
B005K2YRVG|4.0|Good case to store your Kindle in!  It is lightweight but protects the Kindle when you are not using it.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|If you like historical novels, you enjoy this series. Both seasons 1 and 2 are fantastic. Hummor, drama mixed in with the historical events. This was well worth the purchase price and the time.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This item came in several days ahead of schedule.  Of course I immediately opened and began looking it over.  We have another video to record in the upcoming week and now that the mic is here ahead of schedule we can record sooner.  Looking forward to seeing how it sounds and performs.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|very useful on my kindle fire. looks clear with large buttons so it's very easy to use. great for simple everyday calculations.
B0073XORCY|5.0|I was as skeptical about this album as anyone for all of the obvious reasons (how do you follow-up a classic, no Martin, it is 40 years later for God's sake, etc).  And after the first few listens, I was less than impressed.  But like other Tull classics, this album requires multiple plays.  I have listened to the CD most days for the last several weeks in my car, and today, I watched the DVD that shows the lyrics and offers the unbelievable 5.1 sound.  Wow!  The musicianship, the poetic genius, and the thrill is back!  Here is my advice - buy the special edition version, listen many times, watch the DVD, crank the 5.1 sound loud, and you will be ecstatic.  This is arguably in the same class as Aqualung, TAAB1, A Passion Play, Benefit, and Minstrel....
B005LAIGRS|1.0|When I saw the Waterboading .. I said REALLY..<br /><br />Come on Hollywood.. everything is ANTI US..<br /><br />Hum instead of the CIA.. Why not make a movie about HOlder .. Fast and Furious?.. ya right<br /><br />Hollywood should get an extra Obamacare Tax.. for this one!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|In this new series Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are now in the 21st Century, yet the characters have maintained all of the traits that made them so popular.  In the Sherlock:  Season Two you will find a new and fascinating spin on Holmes relationship with the mysterious Irene Adler and a totally new take on the Hound of the Baskerville.  In the Reichenbach Fall you will see the mastery of the character Moriarty and discover the full evolution of the character of Sherlock Holmes.  It is a wonderful series...fast paced, with wonderful writing and sublime acting.  Buy it...it's elementary.
B0086700CM|5.0|I.LOVE.THIS.GAME.  PERIOD. I cant stop playing it on my kindle fire. my nephews love it too.  definitely download it. you wont want to stop!!
B005KELW26|3.0|Love the color and style but wish the whole thing were a little sturdier. A plus would be an extra strap handle for those times when the games get a little intense or the music is rocking...not a bad deal for the price though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well written story that will stay with you long after you finish.<br />It makes you think about things in our world and wonder if they really are as they are presented.<br /><br />Just like Enders game asked the big question what are the limits of morality when your very existence is threatened?<br />This book ask similar questions on a slight smaller, yet more believable scale.<br />In the end the obvious hero's and villains are neither, everything is black and white and gray all at the same time.<br /><br />3/4 of the way through the books the story got a bit dark and tragic for my present personal space and<br />I had to put it down for a day or so.  I thought it was going to end like a Shakespearean tragedy where everyone dies,<br />alas it did not and I look forward to future stories in the wool universe.
B000H5U832|5.0|my two year old is obsessed with this movie, and when the other disc for scratched of course I came to Amazon for a replacement! Can't beat the price and my munchkin is happily enjoying his favorite movie again!
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Making Mirrors is album of the year. It has so many other amazing songs besides the obvious hit. At 0.99 cents today you'd be mad not to buy it!!
0399245030|4.0|With so many reviews, it's hard to add anything.<br /><br />This is a good children's book containing a nice message about friendship and decent illustration. My children have enjoyed it a few times though it isn't one of the favourites yet.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I couldn't even read this all the way through. I actually returned it, it was that awful. There was so much hype surrounding it I thought surely it must be good but upon starting this book I quickly realized it was written by a very immature and childish mind, the plot line it completely unbelievable, it's beyond being call fantasy fiction it's just silly. It truly seemed like it was more of a BDSM for teens, a ramped up version of Twilight. As a grown woman I couldn't read the sex scenes without thinking they were entirely ridiculous. I had high hopes for this book based on the following it's received but really could not get into the ridiculousness of the plot.
0345803485|1.0|This book is terrible! Degrading and disturbing! I'm so sad that all my friends think it's wonderful! I stopped reading after the \\"spanking\\" and I will not be reading any further. I didn't even want to give it 1 star but Amazon doesn't offer 0 stars. It's definatly a 0 star book.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|I have to be honest. I bought this because of its low price and fact it was in 3D.  When my tube type HD TV went out I replaced it with a model with wi fi and happened to have 3D as well.  So I have been buying some less expensive 3D DVD's to watch.  Some have been terrific and this is one shows off 3D very well.  Was not sure what to expect but found that this held my attention from beginning to end.  Have to put near top of the list of my best 3D.  Grand Canyon still my favorite in 3D and Safari next.  But this is up there with best of them.
B004S2W7F2|5.0|I never received this order from Amazon.  If you order this book, order it somewhere else.  I have read a later edition of this book and found it to be excellent and intriguing.  Excellent research on the part of the author.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not the best book Ive ever read, and not the worst. It's a unique love story. The love scenes can be...graphic at times, but they are also necessary to understanding the craziness of the relationship. All in all, it's a good read, not a literary masterpiece, but definetly entertaining.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|Although this is a UK import, it is region free and will work on all Blu-Ray players in the US. The quality is phenomenal, especially considering how old these movies are. I mean we're talking the 1970's here for Alien and it looks Amazing! The audio is crystal clear and the extras will take you forever to go through. Overall it's a great set to add to your collection!
1559408855|4.0|I watched as much as I could of this flim, and while I agree facism is evil. The flim would have been somewhat of enjoyable if it didn't tout Pasolini's proto Marxist views. I could also do without the sh*t eating scenes and close ups of unshaved gentials. The torture scenes look close to being real, and the flim I find to be bueatifully well done, and actors I thought where surperb. I'll take The Gospel Of Saint Matthew over this.
031606792X|5.0|This is a very good book, had me not wanting to put it down, to long to read in one go wish it was
B005J32Y6Q|5.0|Never got to see this when it was touring and enjoyed the video very much.  3D was ok but did not, in my view, add much to the production.  Not the fault of the production but some things are better in 3d than others.  If you think you would enjoy this then I am sure you will.  Easy to recommend especially at Amazon price.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and I have been waiting for it to come outing hope everyone likes it a lot
031261246X|2.0|I'm only halfway through the book and it's getting harder to finish.<br /><br />The opening scene is sex scene in an office by the glow of computer backup lights, odd given the topic of the book.  Every few pages..literally.. is a comment on a woman's body. Odd.  Either the author thinks he needs to throw this stuff into the plot to keep the reader's attention..or he's a bit off.<br /><br />Chapters are broken into a few pages in length with contemporaneous settings as the characters deal with the crisis along a common timeline.  It's not a bad methodology but there are many different settings and it's easy to lose track of the logic of the transitions.  The character of the protagonist is developed well enough, but others are not.<br /><br />So far, the first half of the book is why the government doesn't take seriously the threat of cyber-terrorism; the lonely lives of computer security personnel; and commentary on women's bodies from the omniscient point of view.  I'd probably not buy it had I known..and certainly not full price.
B008CRC506|5.0|If you're here, you probably know that Smash is one of the best shows to appear on television in the last 20 years. Thank you, Theresa Rebeck, for creating it!<br /><br />Great music, great characters (Derek is my favorite), everybody who loves New York and especially Broadway will have a BLAST watching every single episode. What could you expect, it also has Steven Spielberg as one of its executive producers!<br /><br />I'm sure that thousands and thousands of americans and foreigners who love NYC will feel the same way. Am I right?<br /><br />My god... and the original music of this show !?<br /><br />I don't have words to describe how incredible and perfect they are, really, REALLY creative, songs AND lyrics, you have to watch Smash and listen to them yourself, if you still didn't do that!<br />(Don't waste any time, btw, you're gonna fall in love with the original music!)<br /><br />The original songs were written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, these guys deserve no less than a standing ovation! (They are also executive producers). Where do I sign up to work with them?<br /><br />My favorite ones are: \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" (episode 3), \\"On Lexington & 52nd Street\\" (episode 7), \\"A Thousand and One Nights\\" (an AWESOME indian song on episode 12) and \\"Second Hand White Baby Grand\\" (also episode 12). Some of them you can have here [[ASIN:B007X04N7G The Music Of Smash [+digital booklet]]]<br /><br />I, myself, a brazilian born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, have Times Square/Broadway as my favorite place in the city, so you can imagine what it was for me the release of this show.<br /><br />But seriously, on this day and age, no announcement of a Blu-ray release with perfect image/sound and tons of extras? Come on! I'm desperate for a Blu-ray of Smash to watch on my projector! LOL<br /><br />While we wait, here are the names of each episode (and the US air dates) of Smash, season 1:<br /><br />1) Pilot - 2/6/12<br /><br />2) The Callback - 2/13/12<br /><br />3) Enter Mr. DiMaggio - 2/20/12<br /><br />4) The Cost of Art - 2/27/12<br /><br />5) Let's Be Bad - 3/5/12<br /><br />6) Chemistry - 3/12/12<br /><br />7) The Workshop - 3/19/12<br /><br />8) The Coup - 3/26/12<br /><br />9) Hell on Earth - 4/2/12<br /><br />10) Understudy - 4/9/12<br /><br />11) The Movie Star - 4/16/12<br /><br />12) Publicity - 4/23/12<br /><br />13) Tech - 4/30/12<br /><br />14) Previews - 5/7/12<br /><br />15) Bombshell - 5/14/12<br /><br />I'm sure you also probably know that Smash was renewed for season 2. Thank god ! The new season starts only next year, 1/7/13. We're gonna die waiting. ;)3) Enter Mr. DiMaggio - 2/20/12<br /><br />4) The Cost of Art - 2/27/12<br /><br />5) Let´s Be Bad - 3/5/12<br /><br />6) Chemistry - 3/12/12<br /><br />7) The Workshop - 3/19/12<br /><br />8) The Coup - 3/26/12<br /><br />9) Hell on Earth - 4/2/12<br /><br />10) Understudy - 4/9/12<br /><br />11) The Movie Star - 4/16/12<br /><br />12) Publicity - 4/23/12<br /><br />13) Tech - 4/30/12<br /><br />14) Previews - 5/7/12<br /><br />15) Bombshell - 5/14/12<br /><br />I´m sure you also probably know that Smash was renewed for season 2.

B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|Poor story - confusing and boring.  I almost stopped watching mid-way which is something I hardly ever do.  I expected more from this director and cast.
030758836X|1.0|THIS is what passes for a good book these days?  Seriously?  Who did this author's publishing company have to pay to get this kind of hype?  It started off great and then became absolutely, utterly ridiculous.  I'm still annoyed that I bought into the hype and read it.  It was a waste of time.
B00457WZEI|4.0|Well, for sure I enjoyed the book. I saw the movie before reading the book and was pleased that the story-lines were so similar. I understand the book was written as children's literature, however, that meant, for me at least, that it was a quick read and an enjoyable read. Go for it...buy the book and have a great read.
B005FRF6PC|5.0|The book is beautifully written. You do not want to put it down!<br />After reading it, you end up feeling you know Rafa :)<br />I loved it!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I'm a jigsaw puzzle nut- so this was a clever way to have fun without having pieces fall on the floor or get lost by cllinging to the cat's tail. I like the fact you can take it with you! Hard to believe you could get satisfaction out of working it in such a small area!
B000VSYDRM|4.0|This movie pulls you in. Very weird you want to find out what is going on and what will happen. A lot of interesting camera angels and perspectives as well.
B007YYY7HW|5.0|It's  frustrating to miss these episodes when they originally air at a late hour for us.  Having the chance to watch them through Amazon is a GIFT!  We love it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The app has great up to date info with a nice background.  Better than any other weather app that I have used.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is not something I would typically read, but after reading it, I will challenge everyone to read it. I can not put into words how I felt while reading and even after I finished reading this book. I will say it makes me want to be a better person in every way. I normally don't read a book more than once, but I see myself reading this one over and over for inspiration. R.I.P. Adam Brown and God love and take care if your family!
B005QUQP76|5.0|The price on the mouse is a little steep but its a good mouse.<br /><br />It has a sniper button that I never use because it's a little hard to reach.<br /><br />The software needs some more options, and the mouse should store the settings because its a pain switching the settings every time i use another computer.<br /><br />but overall the mouse is really good and made my aim like 100x better than before.<br /><br />I would recommend this mouse to everyone.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a fun addictive game. I keep trying to beat my score. The game contorls are easy you just slide your finger. You just have to be fast enough!
B0086700CM|5.0|At first I wasn't. going to get this game.  I thought how boring.  Boy, was I ever wrong!!!!  Loads of fun. You feel like you&quot;re in your own Indiana Jones move.-
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a heartfelt book of two young people struggling with something much larger than they could ever imagine. This book will make you laugh and cry. Very well written. I could not put it down.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I mainly purchased this to protect the screen when I carry the Kindle in my purse and after placing the order, I even briefly wondered if I was wasting money because I \\"never\\" drop my devices. Ha! After about a week of use of this cover, I accidentally dropped my Kindle about 10 feet from upstairs in my house onto the stair landing! My Kindle survived without a scratch and still works perfectly. If I had not had this cover on it I feel sure it would have been damaged. Cover is also cute and has an easy to use design.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Unless you are a really bored stay at home mom and need a fantasy and escape (like the harlequin romance novels) from kids don't bother reading this book. It is horrible and I couldn't even finish it. The writing is very juvenile due to the story being told through the eyes of a 21/22 year old virgin. Therefore, for an older woman it is really hard to relate to her character. The other main character is not much better. He is just not a likable guy. He is the type of guy that you would make fun of and not take seriously. It was very hard to get through the book so eventually I just gave up.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|It would be unfair not to divulge that I have been a fan of this power trio for many years.  That being said, I am engaged by this album.  The first half of the album is driving and powerful with the chromatic and tempo changes that I have come to expect from Rush. Then they complete the story with the final half of the album,  these songs hold moments of discovery for our hero and resolution of his beliefs with the conclusion of The Garden being among the best songs I have ever heard.<br /><br />Maybe not for the uninitiated to the idea of a concepts album.  If you're looking for mindless rock and roll this is not for you.  If, however you seek a great story set to music, then this will entertain and engage you.
B0083GR6Y6|3.0|There are a lot of scenes that bore you to death as their literally nothing interesting happening. The only parts I enjoyed were the battle scenes between the victims and the abnormally aggressive wolves. This too gets me wondering if there is more to the plot than just 7 lost men and wolves trying to take them out one by one.
B007SGM084|5.0|A Cinderella story. A bad boy redeemed. Hot sex....a lot of hot sex. What's not to love. A little editing to eliminate repetitious phrasing and character thinking and dialogue would have been nice, but I didn't find it much of a detraction.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|Very fancy box, contains all the studio albuns, the book that accompanies is amazing!<br />Great idea, great collection!For those fans, I recommend!
630463949X|5.0|I have watched this at least a thousand times and never get tired of it. My dad really liked it also. So, I bought him this copy for fathers day and he plays it all the time. If youre a Fleetwood Mac fan this is a must, you will wear this one out.
B000002ADT|5.0|What more is there to say about one of the all-time great albums, especially since I'm not an expert? But, a friend urged me to add this one to my (extremely varied) collection and I'm glad I did.  Not a penny wasted.
B008578PRK|4.0|And the story's not that bad. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys that feeling you get when watching horror movies especially suspenseful horrors. To avoid ruining the ending for you all, I will just say I could have called the ending almost as if I were one of the writers for the piece itself.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|LOVE this cd- she has every type of emotion- feeling- slow- fast funky...whatever.  GET IT! Even just her name. Great purchase.  Always in the mood for this.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I went and saw the movie with no hype or anyone else telling me, \\"you gotta see this!\\"  I am a big fan of 80's 'hair' metal and classic rock.  The movie was awesome and the songs have all been playing in my head.  The actors do a great job covering the songs.  I rarely buy full CDs but this one was well worth it and got me through what was supposed to be 5 hour bus ride tha turned into 10 hours!  I can only think of a few other CDs that I can listen all the way through without wanting to skip a track and this is one of them!  (another one is Bon Jovi's 'New Jersey')
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|my wife was very pleased with the price. i was pleased with how quick i recieved them. thanx again for your service
B006RUJST6|3.0|It was a good book, with a few twists. But five stars? I feel the need to balance the reviews with a lower rating.
B008B3F38C|5.0|I love this album.  I love Delain's previous albums too, but this is probably their best to date, and certainly Charlotte's best vocals so far.  The guitars are stronger this time too.  Definitely worth a listen if you like heavy melodic music with beautiful vocals and interesting lyrics.  I hope Delain catches on in the U.S.  They should!
B0083F5ITW|1.0|A lot of critical things have been said about this album (see sampling below), but I think the most accurate and important one is this: \\"On much of the album, Maroon 5 barely sound like a band at all.\\"<br /><br />That's because Maroon 5 no longer really exists. They are no longer creating their own music. They recognized that all of the current hit music falls under categories like \\"disco-flavored dance-floor filler\\" or \\"dance-pop glitz,\\" and they knew to sell songs they'd need to hire outside help. Who'd they hire? Look up names like Max Martin, Ryan Tedder, Shellback, and Benny Blanco--these people are the new \\"Maroon 5,\\" and they are also Pink and Katy Perry and Kelly Clarkson and Usher and Britney Spears and Taio Cruz and Adele and OneRepublic and Gym Class Heroes and Sean Paul and Avril Lavigne and Justin Bieber and Ke$ha and Flo Rida and Pitbull.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I'm going to give out a warning for anyone wanting to buy this record. This is not a full return to Linkin Park's roots. This isn't a revival of their old Nu-Metal sound from 2000 with power chord riffing. This is a mixture of the sounds from previous efforts, while adding some newer elements. A record in which any fan of Linkin Park will be content with, and have certain tracks in which they like. I have to say this once again, like I did in my reviews for A Thousand Suns and Minutes to Midnight: if you are one of those narrow-minded reviewers reading this review, who have given Living Things a bad review saying, \\"This sucks because it's not Hybrid Theory\\", or are planning to give it a bad review based upon that theory, then develop some kind of open mind for band development, in which you will frequently find in this record.<br /><br />OK, that introduction is pretty much culminated, now onto my review.<br /><br />Their first album, \\"Hybrid Theory\\", was strictly a nu-metal effort that did things differently than other bands at the time such as Limp Bizkit. Honestly, HT is my least favorite Linkin Park album to date, not by any means of it being a bad album, but it's solid for what it is to the rock music world. I liked \\"Meteora\\" better than HT, because they matured more on that record than on HT. But, their pinnacle wasn't reached for me until, \\"Minutes to Midnight\\", which was a more developed album than their previous two, despite being detested by the Linkin Park fan-base. It had great songs such as, \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\", \\"What I've Done\\", and, \\"In Pieces\\". Then, there came, \\"A Thousand Suns\\", in which was a concept record similar to Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\", while also incorporating more electronic elements, and doing it a lot better than artists whom of which are strictly for electronic music. This album was criticized by the fans more than MTM, because it was an album that, to them, did not have any traces of HT and Meteora, leading to them wanting another album similar to those two. Which brings us into, \\"Living Things\\".<br /><br />Before the album's release, the band members said that the record would be a slight comeback to their old sound, while incorporating an element from each of their previous records. In this case, the band members have spoken the truth. \\"Living Things\\" is one of the better albums of 2012, and is one of my favorite Linkin Park albums to date, more along the lines of \\"Minutes to Midnight\\".<br /><br />The track listing to this album is very similar to Hybrid Theory, in which there is an instrumental before the final track on the album, \\"Powerless\\". I would say this is the biggest throwback to the HT days. As for the sound on the record, there are traces of it in the first few tracks on the record. \\"Lost In The Echo\\" and \\"In My Remains\\" will instantly be loved by the older fans of Linkin Park, especially the previous. Another notable track that is like this is \\"Lies Greed Misery\\", in which is more of a throwback to Meteora than HT. \\"Burn It Down\\" is the catchiest song on this record, and it's also one of the biggest highlights of the album, though it took a little time to fully grow on me. \\"Victimized\\" is similar to \\"Given Up\\" from MTM, only shorter and more electronic, and \\"I'll Be Gone\\" is also similar to \\"What I've Done\\" and \\"Valentines Day\\" from that same album. \\"Castle of Glass\\" incorporates a more folk style to it, mostly in its beat, and is an exception as to being different than what LP has done before. \\"Roads Untraveled\\" is another exception.<br /><br />However, there are tracks that sound mostly like \\"A Thousand Suns\\" in two of the songs on the album. \\"Skin to Bone\\" has more electronic synthesizers and is similar to \\"The Catalyst\\". \\"Until it Breaks\\" is even more reminiscent of ATS, and is also tied with \\"Burn It Down\\" for best song on the album. This song is very similar to \\"Wretches and Kings\\" and \\"When They Come For Me\\" mixed with \\"Waiting for the End\\". Finally, the instrumental entitled \\"Tinfoil\\" leads into the final track called, \\"Powerless\\", which is destine to be released as a single, and ends the album similarly to \\"Meteora\\".<br /><br />The only problem that this record has is that it is too short, and needs to be extended. But other than that, it definitely shows here that Linkin Park has matured and is not afraid to take risk when it comes to evolving. \\"Living Things\\" will be another memorable album from Linkin Park similar to \\"Hybrid Theory\\", unless the nay-sayers say otherwise. So, prepare to have this record become the next big thing.<br /><br />TRACKS:<br />Lost In The Echo (5/5)<br />In My Remains (5/5)<br />Burn It Down (5/5)<br />Lies Greed Misery (5/5)<br />I'll Be Gone (4/5)<br />Castle Of Glass (4/5)<br />Victimized (4/5)<br />Roads Untraveled (4/5)<br />Skin To Bone (5/5)<br />Until It Breaks (5/5)<br />Tinfoil (4/5)<br />Powerless (5/5)<br />ALBUM SCORE: (55/60)<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 starsd \\"Tinfoil\\" leads into the final track called, \\"Powerless\\", which is destine to be released as a single, and ends the album similarly to \\"Meteora\\".<br /><br />The only problem that this record has is that it is too short, and needs to be extended.

B007P6VLRS|5.0|This album is a perfect return to the Pumpkins true sound. Corgan's voice is amazing and this should have been the album he released right after Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Once you listen to it once, you need to let it play all the way thru again as the songs get better with each listen. #8 Oceania is ridiculously good with so many levels to the song. Nice job Corgan...keep 'em comin with the Pumpkins!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got the black and white version as the FAOTD and really enjoy doing these puzzles so I purchased this one. The larger puzzles are a little difficult on a phone since you either have to scroll a lot or the squares are too small to select but that isn't a flaw in the app, just the downside of using a phone. Looking forward to eventually trying this on a tablet. Hopefully they continue to add new puzzles.<br /><br />The only issue I've come across is a bug on 4.13. One row has no colored cells and that exposes a bug that prevents the numbers from being crossed out on all the completed routes below it. I completed the puzzle but it doesn't recognize it as completed. All columns properly show the numbers crossed out but the rows below the empty row do not. (I did confirm the puzzle is completed correctly so it isn't a matter of having an error in the solution.)<br /><br />UPDATE: The bug mentioned above was fixed in a subsequent release.  New puzzles are also added every few weeks.  Still very pleased with it and it was well worth the $5 I paid for it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game :) I used to play the original. just wished u could earn more energy faster. my kids love it too
B0083F5JE6|1.0|A lot of critical things have been said about this album (see sampling below), but I think the most accurate and important one is this: \\"On much of the album, Maroon 5 barely sound like a band at all.\\"<br /><br />That's because Maroon 5 no longer really exists. They are no longer creating their own music. They recognized that all of the current hit music falls under categories like \\"disco-flavored dance-floor filler\\" or \\"dance-pop glitz,\\" and they knew to sell songs they'd need to hire outside help. Who'd they hire? Look up names like Max Martin, Ryan Tedder, Shellback, and Benny Blanco--these people are the new \\"Maroon 5,\\" and they are also Pink and Katy Perry and Kelly Clarkson and Usher and Britney Spears and Taio Cruz and Adele and OneRepublic and Gym Class Heroes and Sean Paul and Avril Lavigne and Justin Bieber and Ke$ha and Flo Rida and Pitbull. I'm not making this up--it is a fact that almost all of the music we hear on the radio is created by the same few guys whose names you probably haven't heard.<br /><br />I think it would be fair to say that the Billboard 100 has never been in such a sad, homogenous state, and I think it would also be fair to say that the release of this album confirms that modern hit music is vapid and soulless--it is little more than brand names selling catchy hooks created by anonymous dance-pop gurus.<br /><br />Adam Levine himself admits that Overexposed \\"is definitely our poppiest album yet,\\" and he admits that he has a \\"love/hate relationship with it.\\" Maybe he'll get back to doing what he loves if we stop buying dance-pop glitz.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Other things that have been said about this album:<br /><br />* \\"Every song sounds as if it was custom made to play behind the montage of someone's 'journey' in a TV talent show.\\" (The Independent)<br />* \\"It seems more like a collaboration between Swedish hitmakers and AutoTune than between Levine and members of his band.\\" (The Washington Post)<br />* \\"Even with various superstar producers on board, including Max Martin and Ryan Tedder, the album is stridently homogenous.\\" (Boston Globe)<br />* \\"Overexposed is a hit-seeking missile that doesn't just slaughter Maroon 5's reputation for sincerity, it festoons its corpse with glitter.\\" (The Washington Post)tar producers on board, including Max Martin and Ryan Tedder, the album is stridently homogenous.\\" (Boston Globe)<br />* \\"Overexposed is a hit-seeking missile that doesn't just slaughter Maroon 5's reputation for sincerity, it festoons its corpse with glitter.\\" (The Washington Post)
B006L4MX0Y|4.0|Long before \\"The Hunger Games\\" but after \\"Lord of the Flies\\" there was \\"Battle Royale,\\" a Japanese survivalist horror show in which middle school teenagers are forced to murder each other. That's the first hint that \\"Battle Royale\\" is different from \\"The Hunger Games\\" - \\"Battle Royale\\" begins like a nightmare, with children waking up from a field trip terrorized by their sadistic teacher Kitano (Takeshi Kitano). The little exposition provided at the beginning of the film explains that the Battle Royale (BR) Act was instituted after 800,000 students walked out of school.<br /><br />The precise details of the BR Act (along with the society that generates it) is a little fuzzy, but the end result is that middle school classes are randomly chosen to wear explosive collars and murder each other until only one remains.  \\"Battle Royale\\" definitely has some cultural peculiarities that don't translate well to an American audience.  I would think 800,000 students would have to do more than \\"walk out of school\\" to merit a battle to death.<br /><br />But enough details! \\"Battle Royale\\" is most interested in the battle royale and the action starts almost immediately as the students shift from confused whiners to vicious killers.  The class of 40 students rapidly narrows as they commit suicide and murder, all against the backdrop of Japanese middle school drama.  Imagine American high school cliques armed with machineguns and you get the idea.<br /><br />In addition to the 40 students, there are two ringers: one is a murderous psychopath who volunteered for the game; the other is a survivor from a previous game with a dark past. From the zones that threaten to detonate the bomb collars just by straying into the wrong territory (this never actually comes into play in the movie for some reason) to the fact that each student's survival pack is randomly assigned - some without weapons - there is little hope for any of them.  And so each pocket of children plays out a different morality play where, bereft of adult authority and a moral compass, they regress to the laws of Japanese middle school.  There's the star-crossed lovers, the pleasantly facile cheerleading squad, the hacker brotherhood, the bloodthirsty nerd outcast, the bullying jocks, and the sociopathic loner. Not all of these survival strategies are as successful in the social circles of school as they are on the battleground, and director Kinji Fukasaku has fun playing the grim drama out for our amusement as the kill counter clicks down with each death.<br /><br />The acting isn't very good, but something may be lost in the translation between Japanese middle school and American English. The students, unlike the starving paupers of \\"The Hunger Games,\\" seem oddly pampered and bewildered by the fact \\"Battle Royale\\" even exists. In that regard they are less a product of a dystopian society and more akin to the victims in \\"Saw\\".<br /><br />But that distinction makes it all the more terrible as 15-year-old kids reveal the worst and best of human nature. Some characters are unsympathetic ciphers, while others are monstrous because of the societal constraints placed upon them.  Although \\"The Hunger Games\\" certainly provides a more logical place for the ritual murder of children, \\"Battle Royale\\" is its darker shadow, picking up where \\"Lord of the Flies\\" left off.<br /><br />\\"'Maybe there is a beast....maybe it's only us.'\\"<br />- William Golding, Lord of the Flies, Ch. 5ty play where, bereft of adult authority and a moral compass, they regress to the laws of Japanese middle school.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|First of all, Wool is a great story and I highly recommend it. It's not a nail biting, stay up all night page turner, but once you start reading you are quickly hooked. And it's actually well written. I've read several other books lately where the plot was OK, but the writing was so poor I felt embarrassed for the author. Not so here. Mr. Howey knows how to string words together, and even knows what they mean. And as icing on the cake, he is also a gifted storyteller. When I finished the last page I felt the same sense of loss I've always felt after reading a good story, knowing there are no more pages to turn. Bravo, Mr. Howey, I look forward to reading more of you work...

B000P7V45S|3.0|bought this for one reason only: the live performance of supper's ready.  the song is a part of the 'visuals' section of the dvd.  what is included is fine, but my all-time favorite song was cut leaving only the second half.  where's the full song????  oddly, liner notes make no mention of this.<br /><br />aside from this, dts audio is pretty cool.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I don't know why people are complaining about how long this book is. I was disappointed to reach the end. Haruki Murakami puts in so much rich detail, and draws the characters out in such a way that you grow very fond of them, even the creepy ones. I felt like I was there. That is a good writer. I can't wait to read my next book by Haruki Murakami.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I have 5,000 slides to scan and have done about 20% so far.  This is a decent scanner, even though the quality, of course, isn't as good as looking at a projected slide.  As mentioned by everyone else, have a needle nose pliers ready.  Most slides require one in order to easily remove them.  Plastic slide mounts can usually be removed by hand.  Depending on the lighting in the slide, you may need to change the scanner's exposure settings for each slide.  If the slides are of the same scene, then just setting the exposure once should be sufficient.  This is a good scanner for archiving old slides and being able to email them and use them on a photo frame.  It's been a lot of fun to see slides that we haven't seen in 30 years!!!

B001DM1VXE|5.0|I was hooked from the start.  I'm not sure this is a movie for everyone.  It was totally my thing, but I could see if someone were to say it was bizarre to an extreme.  The storyline throttles in pace from slow to breakneck in an instant.  This one will require your full attention, there is a lot going on.  Free movies this cool are why I'm so glad I have a Prime membership.

I can't say the same for some of the other ones...
B001N1DPDE|5.0|EDIT: (July-2015) Regarding this &#34;the hard sheath dulls the blade!&#34; business. I DOESN'T. The earliest versions (ones made prior to my review, years ago) of this hard fiberglass reinforced sheath had material at the mouth of the sheath that made contact with the blade edge on inserting & withdrawing. This issue has long since been taken care of YEARS ago and the sheath has had a redesigned rectangular cutout in that are ever since. So, the hard sheath I have is fantastic. If you like the nylon, get the BK22, if you like the sleeker hard sheath, go with the std BK2 here wituout fear of any concerns about it dulling your blade. That issue is ancient history.  So ends the July 2015 edit.      By now you've probably heard the obvious details so I'll try to comment on a few things that gave me concerns before I bought it. Some major things people have claimed are that it's too hard to remove from the sheath and worst of all, that the blade edge contacts the inside of the sheath dulling the knife. I won't say their claims weren't valid, but I'm happy to say there's no sign of either issue here. Grab the handle, push off with your thumb and out it comes. Perfect resistance, no more, no less. Perhaps Kabar addressed the issue, perhaps complainants forgot to eat their Wheaties. My knife was purchased through Amazon, new June 2012.    The other claim of edge/sheath contact hasn't been the case here. While the sheath allows minimal play, they managed to keep it just right to avoid friction. Perhaps Kabar addressed that too. I even shined a light into the drain hole and looked for &#34;saw&#34; marks. None, whew, what a relief. That issue would have been a near deal breaker.    The nylon webbing belt loop has too much excess allowing a lot of &#34;slop&#34; once on. Stitch it up the SIDES to the proper point to fit your belt and you've got yourself a nice small accessory pocket turning a potential lemon into lemonade.    Regarding the knife itself, I'll echo every positive thing said of it. A slightly wrinkled finish or some stippling on the grip would have been an improvement but I still like the semi-smooth finish. The shape of the grip literally guarantees it won't go flying out of your hand. In a worse case scenario, say gutting an animal and up to your elbows in a greasy mess, could potentially see your hand slip forward onto the blade when contacting bone while doing a forward thrust. Possible, but unlikely.    When it comes to indestructible fixed blades, I own a few Ontario blades since they're the guys who supply the US military. I like that endorsement. They also don't charge stupid prices. This is my first Kabar and I like what I see. I challenged myself to find even a minor blemish or imperfection. I can't, and that is unusual. This BK2 is flawless right down to its sabre grind. If I had to face the unknown and I could take one tool with me- it would be this or an Ontario RD6, or their SP8. For what it is, $64 is worth it. You can spend a little more and perhaps find its equal (Ontario RD6), but for no amount of money are you going to do better. No, I don't own every blade in the world, but I just can't see doing much better if at all. Oh, and if you want to find its match for less, forget it. Money matters, I know, but it's a matter of &#34;buy once, cry once&#34;. Don't worry, you'll feel better once you feel this thing in your hand. It made me want to chop down a tree for no reason at all! But I didn't ;-).  UPDATE: I hope you found the info useful in making your decision, except ofcourse for the dimwit who I've noticed has clicked &#34;not helpful&#34; on every single review. Maybe it's not malicious, after all, no review can be found helpful to an illiterate.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|You know you are reading a great book when half way through, you are searching online to see if there is more of this series because it's so good, you want to find out all you can about it. Then you find yourself in the conundrum--you want to read the book as fast as you can because you must find out what will happen, but at the same time, you want to take it slow because you just don't want it to end yet. And when you finish you are sad because it's almost like you've lost a friend.<br /><br />Needless to say, I loved this book. I have been reading a lot of dystopian books and I was so thrilled to find one from the point of view of adults, instead of 16 year old girls. There is so much that makes this book special. The likability of the characters (and not so much that they are nice, but because they are real), the science fiction, the mystery, the suspense. I am usually a disciplined reader, but in the last installment, I kept finding myself taking peeks chapters ahead because I couldn't wait to see what happened!

1452101248|3.0|The title of my review sums it up, but Amazon needs at least 20 words so here goes.  I love cookbooks that have great photos - and this cookbook grabbed my attention when I saw a small picture of it in People magazine.  I bought it for a gift for a newly married couple, but ended up returning it because, although it is colorful, it is complicated.  (I never made any of the recipes, and my potential gift recipients are very 'no-fuss' vegetarians, so while I could tell it would make a great gift for some folks, personally gift-wise - not a good fit in my situation).  But, for an experienced, capable cook (chef?), this appears to be a very interesting book.  I did page through this book before deciding to return it.  The ingredients can be numerous and in my (comparably)limited world of cooking - perhaps hard to find. Had I kept it for myself, at some point perhaps I'd have attempted to try a recipe or 2, but likely this cool cookbook would have remained largely undisturbed on my kitchen shelf, an indication that I Like Cool Cookbooks.  Can't say anything bad about the book at all, just not what I had in mind.
0345803485|5.0|well what can I say, I Totally LOVED the 3 books, very rare that I enjoy a book after reading Twilight saga, but WOW, these books made me laugh, cry, smile and well feel naughty. I read all 3 books in 3 days, and am starting all over again, good story, VERY VERY naughty and all round Love story, have told my friends about these books and they are all reading them and cant put them down either, Hmmmm time 2 go Mr. Grey is calling hehe! Enjoy!
0060935464|5.0|I've read the book before in high school, need it again for college courses. Book came in excellent condition, looks like new, and was received in a very good amount of time. Would buy from again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy just one touch play without having to click and drag.  Makes for very fast playing. However, I wish there was an automatic reset button on the bottom of the screen.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|Like many movies that have come before it, this movie is centered around ancient civilizations, battlegrounds, and myths. It doesn't have much particularly new to offer, unfortunately, which is probably the main reason why it seems to be slipping through the cracks into obscurity. Probably the best thing about this movie is Mickey Rourke in the role of the lead villain. He makes a great villain, to be sure! As I was sitting there watching this movie, I couldn't help but think I had seen this movie before. There are so many similarities between this movie and movies like [[ASIN:B000V39KDO 300]], [[ASIN:B003RV43X4 Clash of the Titans (2010)]], [[ASIN:B001N4OX82 Troy]], and even [[ASIN:B0019IGNSK The Scorpion King]], that I just didn't find it all that interesting. It's not a terrible movie, but without much to distinguish itself, it isn't a great movie, either...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I succumbed to the hype and read this book, but won't be reading the next two. Moving on to great books--with a sigh of relief.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|In my opinion, The Forgotten Garden is one of the best books I've read this year. The characters are compelling and the answer to the mystery at the heart of the tale is revealed at just the right pace. I loved it!
B007K3JCAE|5.0|While the first movie featuring Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes was a blast, it was more of an introduction to the world as Guy Ritchie sees it.  The biggest thing missing from the first film was Moriarty.  Although he is hinted at in the first film, his major involvement as this film's villain is a definite improvement.<br />I knew I would want to have this movie accessible to me, so I ordered it from Amazon.ca, and paid the extra shipping so I could avoid the Ultraviolet scam and get a true digital copy.  Hopefully Warner Bros. will wake up soon and realize that people want a more dependable way to access their \\"digital copies\\", which doesn't mean having to connect to a website!<br />The movie itself is a five star film.

0345803485|1.0|Unlike many of those who have reacted unfavorably to this piece of garbage, I have no concerns regarding feminism or equality. I simply found the writing to be painful. I felt like I was proof reading a creative writing piece for an eighth grader. So much unnecessary vocabulary, you can tell she had a a thesaurus on her lap and was referencing it for every other word. Doesn't work in disguising bad writing. The characters were depressing and in no way relatable. The names \\"Anastasia\\" and \\"Christian\\" are so contrived right off the bat. The fact that she doesn't have a father figure or any close family was so obviously added for the convenience of anyone who would feel sad that \\"Anastasia\\" would willingly become a \\"submissive.\\" The fact that she is a virgin and has \\"never been drunk before\\" for the convenience of the story. iIt's all just lazy/uncreative writing. I just used the book to kill a bug. I'm going to do everyone who asked to borrow it a favor and just throw it out now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have had the realization that until I acquired this book, I had allowed myself to become a victim of some tasteless promoter feeding me drivel from a trough so that I never went looking for something better to feed my mind.  It's like what is wrong with the music industry as well; you have to dig through the crap piled on by the major labels [publishers] or go to some dive bar [independent book store] for a live show to find anything of value. Don't get me wrong, occasionally I will get a hold of an author that is on a best sellers list and still able to get good work out there.  Inevitably though, contracts and deadlines seem to kill the inspiration, or the greed of knowing celebrity can sell gibberish takes over.<br /><br />Even if you aren't into apocalyptic, alternate reality, science fiction, etc., you will enjoy this read.  It is good fiction and stimulating on so many levels.  We need better access to works like this.  I humbly recommend that you buy this, read it, and review it. Then take the time to compare it to the other fiction on the other \\"top\\" lists. Share your reviews and thoughts.  Buy other self published works.  Then go see the movie (yes there is going to be a movie).  This, 50 shades, and others that are making it self published can springboard into inspiration for other young writers that have so much to offer but keep getting the door slammed in their faces because they \\"haven't put in the time\\".<br /><br />The scene is set in such precise inference that your mind fills in the gaps with what you expect to see, smell, and feel if you were there. There is no filler of nonsensical detail that is so common from weaker writers looking to fill pages.  The characters are elegantly human, simple, and fit into common personalities you can associate with, love or hate.  They have the faces of people you know and your attachment to them is relative to your own acquaintances.  The story allows them to fall victim to or conquer their various circumstances and the outcomes at times surprising, are believable and satisfying.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is awesome and I have had no promblem playing but it is stupid that your character has energy and it takes to long to get more
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book is so amazing. I love romance/drama books, but this one is not \\"too sexy\\" or \\"too cheezy\\" or \\"too predictable\\" like nearly every other one is. This book just grabs you in to the well written story and keeps you there even after reading. It was great, thats all I can say! I've read this & the sequel, I hope the author writes more soon!
0824835921|4.0|Great book, great method.<br />I've studied it for less than 10 hours so far (anytime I'm on the bus) and I know about 80 Kanji now.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I want my $12.50 back from when i saw it in the theatre.  There's no way I'm giving them any more money for this garbage.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome and it is an easy way to blow of time if you are bored and I have no promblem playing
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book and the entire series is amazing! I have a heard time finding a book that is memorable and this one does that and more. It hits a nerve in everyone that makes you feel like you could do something amazing. It gives you a sense of hope while also keeping it realistic so it isn't cheesy. I will recommend this book to everyone!
B007SGM084|1.0|I was hoping the main characters were lost at sea so the saga would end.  I am midway through the second in a series of three books.  If you enjoy poorly written romance novels with graphic sex, this is for you.  The female main character is drawn to a controlling man who tells her what to eat, stalks her, dislikes her friends...sound familiar?  This is the kind of man that intelligent women divorce within a few years.  This trilogy is on my Kindle, and I wish I could get a refund.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I'm quite pleased with this purchase.  As others have said it's a good hex, turn-based wargame.  I downloaded it this evening and played the first 6 \\"intro\\" missions.  The graphics are pretty good.  I'm playing a Fire and I wouldn't touch this on a phone.<br /><br />The weak link (as with all wargames of this nature) is the AI.  I'm concerned that this will become another get the most resources and auto win game.  I won't stop playing it.  The multiplayer option is pretty exciting, though I'll have limited use of that.  I have the kindle to entertain me when I'm not on the internet.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|I lived in England during the Thatcher years (as a child) and have some memories of the poll tax riots and such so I was looking forward to a story about the Iron Lady.  instead the movie focuses on the shell of the Iron lady.  Very little substance to this movie.  I would not recommend this movie unless you want to see some good acting about dementia/delirium.<br /><br />The analogy to this would be a movie about Reagan that spent 3/4 of it showing him unable to take care of himself.  Many of us may lose our mental faculties one day and I would hope that our children would not focus on that.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app.  additional puzzles are decently prices.  99 cent for an 8 pack.  my friend plays this and loves it as well.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game I is fun I play it all the time now it is so awesome it is so cool
1610454812|5.0|Hillebrand's \\"Unbroken\\" made me angry...at everything and everyone Japanese (yes, I got over that).  I was equally astounded at Semperini's survival and that this story had stayed underground for so long.  While i marveled at Hillebrand's storytelling, it seemed that perhaps she took some liberties...and it felt like she morphed easily into  \\"historical fiction/docu-drama\\".<br /><br />Not so with Blehm's \\"Fearless\\".  This is non-fiction but written so well that you sometimes don't even realize it.  Awe, inspiration, sadness/tears, envy, bewilderment, empathy, sympathy, pride....unusual to get all that in a non-fiction wrapper !<br /><br />For those who might think this is just glorifying the Navy SEALS....don't sell yourselves short.  It's much bigger than that.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is better than the original and takes me back to the old school. it is definitely a good way to kill time at work!
B0000CDNYM|5.0|My 2 year old loves this movie. She has watched it maybe 100 times. The colors are bright and the animation is incredible.  Nice addition to our DVD collection.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Have not yet finished the book but find myself going back to it in the hope that there will be some redeeming value to come. In my opinion, to date, it is just thinly disguised porn for the masses.  I have advised a number of my friends not to bother reading it, there are far more edifying books to be read.
B007JRUCGO|4.0|I don't understand what all the fuss and bad reviews are about. I thought the film was adorable, my 58 y.o. mother enjoyed herself and my 6 y.o. had a blast watching it at the movies in 3D. Characters were cute, premise of working together was nice and the music fun! From a baby penguin singing and dancing to \\"walk-it-out\\" to my personal fave, \\"Under Pressure\\"...what more should one expect from the Happy Feet franchise??
B003O86FMW|5.0|----WARNING:SPOILERS----<br /><br />WHY:<br />I have to admit, when i first heard of this trlogy i thought it would be about some contest in a school to co.pete for food and i would imagine two fat kids running towards some chicken legs. Than, after i heard my friend, my lnguage arts teacher and the language arts coach kept saying how good of a book it was and they would talk about it with eachother and i heard my friend tell my teacher whats going on at the end and spoiling the book for him. She was talking about the bombings in district twelve. Finally, the trailers for the hunger games movie comes out and i said &#34;Well, the movie look like it going to be good so i'll read the first book and see if i like it.&#34; When i read it i was stunned at how great this book was so i decided to read the rest of the trilogy. Today i finished the cathcing fire book.<br /><br />The Hunger Games:<br />16 year old Katniss Everdeen lives in district twelve. Every year there is what we call the hunger games. Since nobody usually volunteers they have this raffle wher on boy and one girl from each district is chosen to fight to the death for wealthiness. Once Katniss' sister prim is called in the reaping to be in the hunger games , Katniss volunteers to take Prim's place. The boy who is called  for the hunger games is Peeta. Before they leave for the games Madge (mayors daughter) gives Katniss a pin witha mockingjay on it. (This is very important later). Before the games is an interview wih every tribute (competetor in the games), so Peeta and Haymitch (Peeta and Katniss' mentor) decide to act like Peeta and Katniss are in love for more sponsors. I can't tell you any more i hav spoile too much but you can read the boook if you buy it which i reommend. Its great!!<br /><br />Catching Fire:<br />In the second book Peeta and Katniss have survived their first hunger games.Katniss figures out that someone has said that Gale (her friend) is her cousin during THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS INTERVIEW. Before their  victors tour, Katniss learns that the stunt she did to keep both Peeta and heersel alive is affecting her. She think during most the tour and gets terrible nitemares that she starts to scream in her sleep. Thats when her and Peeta have a nightly routine to sleep in the same room so Peeta can confort her. When they get back home Katniss and Madge have become closer frineds. One day Katniss is looking at th television and there has been an uprising in district eight. Katniss goes out to the woods alone one day and runs into two survivors of the uprising from district eight. Sh figures out that people use the pin that madge gave katniss as a sign of rebellion. The two girls Katniss run into tell her they are headed to district thirteen that was bombed years ago. They say that they believe that under district thirteen is some type of place people can live free of the games. When Katniss goes back home the gate that seperates district twelve and the woods has some kind of electric current going through it. Katniss finds a way back in district twelve but in the process to get there she hurts her ankle and now she limps a bit but she can still hide it. She buys some candie and medical things for her mom and prim to use on the sick and goes home to find two people from the capitol waiting for her. Want to know what happens next? Well read the book to find out.<br /><br />Now onto reading the last book in the trilogy, THE MOCKINGJAY!!! :D Gonna love it!!!!!!RVIEW.

B0086700CM|5.0|awesome game nice when your bored something to keep your mind occupied.  I could play this game all the time.
B0063IH60K|2.0|now you have to watch a commercial between each game and you cannot get away from it. Glad I didn't pay for this. I will be deleting.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This is easily one of the best AC/DC albums ever made.  Every track is great and has that classic crunching hard rock sound that everyone loves about their music.  There is not a weak track on this album but my favorites are:<br /><br />Highway to Hell<br />Girls Got Rhythm<br />Touch Too Much<br />Beating Around the Bush<br />Shot Down in Flames<br />If You Want Blood (You've Got It)<br />Night Prowler<br /><br />I know that is most of the tracks on the whole album but that should give you some idea of the level of greatness of this album.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|if you play this game you have to check up on it because your food could spoil other wise this game is great plus check out bakery story nightclub story and fashion story they are a great
B008CP92ZO|4.0|Watched this as a last resort b/c there was not much to choose from on the day we were looking for a movie.  It was entertaining and exceeded our expectations.  Laughed out loud many times and was an overall fun watch.
B0083GOPSG|3.0|It was a good movie. Leaves you wondering what that thing was that gave them the powers. Hope there is a part two.
1407130293|5.0|This Trilogy was ordered for a Senior in High School.  It is a required reading over the Summer for her English Honors 4 Class.  Although she was only required to read \\"The Hunger Games,\\" I bought the set because I'm sure that she will want to continue reading them after reading the first book.  We saw the movie and it was really intense and we wished we had the book to read before we saw the movie, to fill in some holes. This set was shipped really fast and it was in excellent condition!  We already have friends that want to borrow the books once we finish reading them!  This movie has received GREAT reviews in our area and we look forward to reading and viewing them all!
B0002XEDQM|5.0|Even though I have always liked Ray Charles for his music, there is no beating this offer. If you like Bonnie Rait, Norah Jones, Michael MaCdonald(I don't), Willie Nelson, and others, this is a winner by design. Wouldn't matter though if the sound quality wasn't there. In this case, there are only two tracks that I would skip. It's not that I don't enjoy Van Morrison's singing, it's just that this duo doesn't do it for me. Ray is right on, but Morrison has a little edginess to his voice. Might be the mike chosen, dunno. You already guessed who I might skip so I don't have hear someone sing through their nose. That being said, the rest of these recordings are just great. I am a fan of SACD for this reason, it appears that an extra effort is made for this medium. It should be, just look at the sky high prices! This album was a gift from my son for Fathers day. Now I know what I mean to him.
B00846REIS|2.0|WOW...I'm pretty shocked how she pretty much took all the threads (save the heavy s&m) of 50 Shades, moved them around and wrote this book. Sure the sex scenes were good but the story line, the same really insecure female and billionaire high powered exec under 30 it was just such a obvious capitalization off of 50 Shades it was a bummer.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was a great book that moved quickly, kept my interest and I enjoyed every minute of it.  I can't believe she kept going, but I was rooting for her every chapter!
1585427683|4.0|I ordered this book after listening to a motivational speaker. The speaker suggests that it is one of the best books on mind dynamics that was ever written. I have read the book through once and am reading it again. I find it to be very helpful and have found that the suggestions in it really work. Would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic.
B007HJ84ZK|2.0|Every episode costs $3. It's overpriced. The scenery is lovely, and the series has one or two good actors. However, this story lacks irony and true character development (they're all \\"ordinary joes\\", which is supposed to make them identifiable-meaning they don't have true swings of temperment, ambitions, anything...) I don't care that that one is a king and this one is a little boy who is crippled for life because of an attempt on his life, or another is a car salesman from Toledo. There is never any doubt what any one of them is going to do. I can honestly say that after 2 episodes, that I know for certain that the aforementioned boy will somehow wreak violent revenge on the guy who pushed him off the tower-but only after much time (and viewer patience) has passed, and only for the death of his dad, which I foresee... I know the sister sold as a bride will wreak violent revenge on everybody for the death of her husband with the eyeliner. Yeah, I haven't seen the episode where he dies, but I'm quite certain he will. The car salesman from Toledo will have sex with somebody that is considered sexy because it's somehow violent itself (it's a rape, or it's incest, or something else gross). Then the salesman will plot dire revenge (which will only be death) against somebody for doing the very same thing he did. I envision more tournament battles amongst two characters to the death. I envision the discovery of many creatures that never play a significant part in the development of the plot, but will somehow be the deciding factor in some epic finale. (Maybe the white walker thingie? Or will the white walker thingies be a persecuted minority?) Anyway, after I post this, I'm gonna Wikipedia the series to see how many of these predictions were true. I might have missed one or two, but on the whole, I think I rather have the thing figured out. As one commenter put it, (who gave it 5 stars, by the way-wish I'd read her post before buying it) \\"it's renaissance porn with gore\\".
B003VANOFY|4.0|I replace a set of Sennheiser RS 130 with the G930's.  Over all I am very pleased and the big reason for the move, a mic, works great.  The sound is crisp and I have had not issues with the headset cutting out, also the annoying moments of static from the RS130 are gone.<br /><br />The software offers some nice options, like it is really funny to swap to Squirrel mode for voice chat and the batter life estimate.  I also like the G-Keys and the fact you can change their function based on what program had focus in Windows.  The switch from 7.1 to Stereo works great to swap from music to games & movies.  Also the base response is pretty good for a pair of wireless headphones.  Finlay it is nice you can charge while using them, and I must metion that these do not use your PC's sound card.<br /><br />Now for the bad.<br />I really miss my charging cradle; I wish there was a better option than plugging them in.  Also unlike the RS130's I can't swap the batteries out when I am on marathon computer session.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|this is a great game if you like to be bored to death.  I got thinking it would be like temple run or aleast fun but it wasn't it was just plain stupid you cant do anything sooooooooooo boring.  yawn.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is my favorite John Mayer album,I can put it on and just let it play itself out. I personally recommend it especially if you're just getting into John Mayer, or if your not liking his new material this is something a little old school to remind you how awesome of a musician he is.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Really love this movie since i was a kid had to buy it cuz no longer in store and found this for cheap
B001NE80P4|4.0|While a little cheesy, this movie is a great conclusion to the High School Musical Series. I loved it, and I'm looking forward to see it again soon :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a very fun game download now no in game expenses nothing except fun.  download now it is not a waste of time
030758836X|4.0|I was very happy to discover this author.  This book is one that you want to keep reading.  It does not drag on.  BUT I was disappointed with the ending.  It leaves it up to reader to imagine the ending.
0752847856|3.0|There may be some spoilers so beware if you read this. This book was very well written , but the plot and characters left me very angry and confused. The hero of the book could very well have been the terrorist , he outsmarted the supposed hero every step through out the entire book even at the end. The terrorist was also fighting for a cause were has Gabriel and shamron were basically doing it for themselves and Shamron was a lying coniving bastard the whole time. And last but not least the love interest of the hero was a whore how where you supposed to develope a liking for her while she was banging a terrorist the whole time it was just weird I wanted her to die. The only thing that saved this book was it was well written and the hope the next one is better.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it beast best game. ever. cut the rope is ok Angy birds is cool but Temple run is. the beast best game ever
030770663X|5.0|I purchased this cd because I enjoyed the first two books. I found it very good. I would recommend this book to everyone.
1594744769|5.0|Speechless! Loved it. Suffice to say that I read it within twelve hours. Dont want to say too much as I don't want to be a \\"spoiler\\". This book is a written representation of a series of \\"peculiar\\" photos from the past. Novel incorporates a \\"portal\\" premise that is so believable that you are there before you know it. Really reluctant to say anymore - don't want to spoil it. Best book I have read in at least 12 months - it is so different. You have to read it!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app was simple to set up and works great to remotely access my desktop. It has made it easy to grab files off of my desktop when I'm on the go.
B0086DBE62|1.0|bad story<br />fake looking set<br />bad acting<br /><br />not worth your money, I expected much more from a movie with Julia Roberts and Sean Bean!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yes, there were some very adult portions to this book but it was basically a beautiful love story. I have read it twice and each time I see the beauty of the love these two shared that went beyond any other issues in the book. Each of these characters evolved into half of a couple as is necessary in a really deep love. Their family characters were demonstrated as people who are real. Who doesn't like a beautiful love story?  Anastasia became a woman through the love of a good man and Christian became a better man through the love of a good woman.  We all \\"read past\\" something in a book that isn't our taste but the more adult passages of this trilogy did not take one tiny bit from the deepness of loyalty between boss and employees or between man and woman.  I LOVED IT. I hope E.L James writes another trilogy about characters with the depth of these characters. I got lost in their beauty and devotion.
0375836675|4.0|Really liked this quirky story. Like his writing style although he perhaps overuses the short, sharp sentence. Totally different from The Bookthief - worth reading. Easy to read and refreshing. Appeals to all ages.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|It looked like a fun game, but wouldn't load on my Casio Commando G'ZONE. Oh well, at least it was the FAOTD.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have calculators all around me so when I downloaded this I wasn't seriously in need of a calculator. However when I downloaded this I was amazed literally amazed. It is so incredibly easy to use. I highly highly highly recommend this app. don't be an idiot and don't have second thoughts about dowlanding this app. DOWNLOAD IMMEDIATELY. You won't regret it. I promise.
B005CAATXG|5.0|I am in my mid-thirties and find myself more and more becoming like my parents.  On many occasion I find myself thinking that all new music is garbage, songs and singers were better in my day yadda yadda you get the idea.  Then along comes Icon For Hire!  I find this band and their music very refreshing.  The music actually tells a story and is not a bunch of four word lyrics strung together and sung over and over again.  This music has heart and soul.  I hope they keep it up, if they do they have a fan for life.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There are better 2.99 books on Amazon, even .99. There's better erotica out there. Theres nothing i can say that hasnt been said already. Its reptetive, the same sex scene with a slight variation on the setting or the tool used. The thing is I'm a sucker for these problem solver hero types: Jean Marc from the French Detectives Woman, Richard from Anita Blake, James from Decadent Tales, and Christian Grey is one of them. Although Christian Grey comes across as flamboyant sometimes  so at times it was a turn off. Save yourself the 9.99 and borrow it from a friend who fell for the hype like I did.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really really cool, and fun.I love this game and if you think you should get this game you should it's a fun game and this game works great on my kindle Fier.
B005ANZN3Q|2.0|It is a pop concert format. Visually stunning but there is very little to show how the music is produced.<br />Camera work is very distracting, changing scenes every second.<br />About 5 minutes in total of the program shows how the pianist produces this magic.<br />If you are a fan of Lang Lang's playing then I recommend you buy a CD of the concert rather than the DVD.<br />Surely the reason for a film of a pianist is to see how he/she makes the music.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So many uses as well editions of the Bible.  Easy to make notes.  Easy to set up your own Bible. Studies or you can follow the suggested plan.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game it's = to super Mario bros!! it's. fun because the you get acorns to shoot like Luigi.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Remember the 80's? Pretty in Pink, Commodore 64, Dungeons and Dragons? Like video games, pop culture, excitement? This book appeals to everyone in some way. I felt like a kid again reading a Choose Your Own Adventure book. I dragged it out as long as I could, I did not want it to end! I immediately began the quest to make everyone I know read this book. This book was AWESOME. Read it.
0307592731|1.0|So, after having multiple affairs while married to her supposedly wonderful husband and becoming a heroine junky with a guy so hideous that when she becomes pregnant with his baby there is no doubt she will abort- and indeed she does (did she even call the guy?) she goes right back in the sack and does heroine again with this person so horrible that the baby must die.  Hey Cheryl- maybe instead of honoring your mom by ruining your marriage, becoming a junky, sleeping around, and behaving in the most irresponsible, horrible ways possible you could have finished college, got a degree, got a job, honored your marriage vows, paid off the student loans that you took out (instead of whining about having to pay for the loans which you, an adult, took out), and became a contributing member of society.  This book is so awful as to be unbelievable.  If this book is true, the author needs to seek mental health treatment.  I want my money back.  Only buy this book if you want to read the story of a woman so self-indulgent, so egotistical, so lacking morals, and so whiny that you will need to take a shower just to wash off the stench of the authors behavior and go out amongst normal people.  I wonder who told this woman it would be a good idea to write a book which reveals her as an absolute jerk.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|\\"The idler wheel is...\\" is by far one of the best releases from Fiona Apple. If you're looking for a record to listen to where a singer is singing like if she was a fish in the ocean, THIS is the record you should go for.<br /><br />Fiona's voice is bright and sharp in here and in every song you identify the passion and love she places on every tune she works with. I personally love songs like \\"Daredevil\\", \\"jonathan\\", and \\"The peryphery\\"... the stretches on Apple's voice in these songs are great... very \\"Blues\\". On the other hand I believe that \\"hot knife\\" is my favorite song on the record. It's very catchy and it flows in such a natural way that you end up singing it all day long.<br /><br />People have said that this record is closer to what Fiona Apple did on her first release \\"Tidal\\" (1997). But, in my opinion this is far from the truth. \\"Tidal\\" was an awesome record by its own means but the production of it was structured. \\"The idler wheel is...\\" on the other hand it flows on a more natural way without being over produced.<br /><br />Go for this record and you won't regret it.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I'm a very big Game of Thrones fan and just had to buy this the second I had enough money. I love all the characters and the actors playing them are just superb. It loods amazing on my tv and with the added bonuses you get whisked away into the world of Westeros and all its glory. I've rewatched it a few times now and it just doesn't disappoint, it's dramatic, funny, suspenseful, and just awesome watching all the characters get fleshed out and seeing where their story takes them. I already pre-ordered the second season and can not wait to get my hands on it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The \\"Silo Series\\" as I've heard it called, is an amazing series of stories. It's a truly interesting universe with a good storyline and awesome characters. It's one of those stories that pulls you in immediately and keeps a hold of you the entire time. I can already tell that this is going to be one of those series that I go back to and read again and again.
B00486070K|1.0|Can't speak for all of them, but a warning is in order.  The particular one that I ordered (from a third party vendor via Amazon) did not work.  I took it to an Apple store for assistance and after a thorough inspection, they explained that it was a very good imitation, but not a genuine Apple product.  I subsequently purchased a genuine one from the Apple store that worked perfectly and instantly.  Amazon customer service, as always, came through for me and gave me a full refund.  Amazon rocks.<br /><br />I have received criticism for rating this product one star when the product I received was admittedly a counterfeit.  My reasoning is simple, if I had rated it five stars, people might assume as I did that when ordering this product from Amazon, they were getting the genuine Apple product, which was not my experience.<br /><br />As I indicated, the genuine Apple product purchased from an Apple retail store worked flawlessly and would rate five stars.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Like Sean of the Dead but strangley more realistic. Hands down a funny movie. Finds the humor in slasher/horror films and runs with it.
0345803485|2.0|The story line was good.  The book was nowhere near as kinky as I had expected it to be.  Overall it was a disappointment, the people saying this is porn for women, have never read any type of erotica books before, and have no idea what BDSM is.
B000QRIGJY|3.0|I love a mystery that keeps the pages turning. This was good, but I didn't mind putting it down to do other things in between reading it.

B0053O89Z6|3.0|How I Met Your Mother is my favorite show on television right now, period. So it pains me to be a harsh critic, but this season is deserving of three stars. Whether I look at it as its own entity or in comparison to previous seasons, Season 7 just did not live up to standards. There were some high moments, and there were some episodes that momentarily renewed my faith that the writers were onto something, but ultimately I found myself disappointed in the end result.<br /><br />The irony is that in most cases the writers will start running out of ideas in latter seasons. In this case, I think the writers have too many fresh ideas and filmed an abundance of stories in Season 7 that either weren't necessary or felt completely rushed. My biggest problem with How I Met Your Mother's seventh season is that the show tried to fit about three seasons of stories into a 24 episode arc.<br /><br />**Will Contain Spoilers**<br /><br />The first thing I look at in a season of expedited stories is the relationship aspect of the show. Robin, for example, started dating Kevin in the fifth episode of the season, 'Field Trip.' By the sixteenth episode, 'The Drunk Train', Kevin proposed to Robin. If I am to follow a timeline that runs parallel to the air dates of the episodes, Robin and Kevin dated for just over four months.  Is it impossible? No, not really. Improbable, not impossible.<br />Barney's story with Quinn, though, just might be too far beyond believable. Noteworthy is the fact that we're talking about the quintessential womanizer for a good portion of the show. I liked the direction Barney's character was headed in. I thought his reconciliation with his father in Season 6 was a good turning point for him and a plausible explanation for his sudden change of lifestyle. However, this Quinn story is simply an overload of absolute silliness and absurdity. Barney met Quinn in 'The Drunk Train', episode 16. She didn't agree to go out with him until the eighteenth episode, 'Karma.' By the season finale, they'd been dating an astoundingly brief 2 ½ months, yet Barney proposes to her and she accepts without so much as a hesitation.  I can't fathom in what walk of life this is realistic, especially given the fact that Barney is just a few months removed from leaving Nora because of his feelings for Robin. Over a season or two, this works. Over half a season this may even be justifiable, but the pace at which this story develops is plainly inconceivable.<br /><br />The second thing I look at in this season of accelerated story lines is the fact that over the course of an 8 month period, Lily and Marshall called three different places home. Moving is certainly an arduous task for any couple to take on, but we're dealing with two moves in a matter of months by a couple expecting their first child. 'The Slutty Pumpkin Returns' first introduced the house in the suburbs, but it wasn't until Thanksgiving, 'The Rebound Girl' episode, that Marshall and Lily agree to move into her grandparents' old home. While my feelings on the move were lukewarm to begin with, the brevity of their stint on Long Island combined with the lack of funny stories associated with the house pushed me over the edge. I thought it was a fantastic idea for Ted to give Lily and Marshall their old apartment back, but the mess leading up to that moment cast a dark cloud over what should have been a joyous full-circle moment.<br />*And on the subject, why is Ted subletting someone's apartment when he just as easily could've moved into the house he purchased two years earlier? My only explanation is his desire to stay in the city, but it shocks me what little mention of his house has been made since 'Home Wreckers' aired in Season 5.<br /><br />All that being said, a formidable season finale could have negated a lot of the wrong turns the show made in Season 7. While I was generally content with most of what went on, I needed time to digest the last 15 minutes or so of the season. TheBarney/Quinn/Robin side of the story was utterly predictable and I was ultimately both pleased and slightly relieved with the wedding couple. It should be interesting to see how the writers get from where they are now to where they need to be.<br />The Ted and Victoria side of the story, however, I'm still feeling some animosity towards. Let me state for the record that Victoria is my favorite recurring character on the show. I thought she was dynamite in Season 1, and her appearance in 'Ducky Tie' not only helped tie up some loose ends but it served as a reminder that some old flames just never burn out. If you had told me at the beginning of the season that Ted and Victoria would wind up back together, I would have been ecstatic. But the way it was done felt over-the-top, rushed, and above all, unrealistic. It didn't have to be Victoria's wedding day, first of all. That served no purpose but to make Ted look like a villain for doing to another what nearly killed him. Second of all, Victoria's dialogue in the bar was very strange and outlandish considering the circumstances. She'd spent one evening with Ted in six years. She had zero contact with him otherwise, and it just felt way too easy for this woman to bail on everything her life had in store to \\"ride off into the sunset\\" with another man. There needed to be rising action here. The story needed a few episodes to develop, and if Victoria felt this strongly about Ted, she should've been the one to initiate contact with him. It all felt very wrong, and again (to beat a dead horse), implausible. I thought the one saving grace from their resurrected romance was Ted's flashbacks right before he decided to drive past the church. Obviously this is a girl he'd watched walk out on him twice through no fault of his own, and I can understand why Ted could not bear the thought of watching her go again. After all, as Robin put it, this was the one that got away. But as badly as I want to buy into this story, it's just too much of a reach. I hope they clean it up in Season 8.<br /><br />With all that being said, I thought the show did some good things in Season 7:<br />- 'Ducky Tie' (7.03) was a great episode, in my opinion. Victoria helped drive the story, but I was more drawn in by the group's interaction at the Japanese restaurant. Very clever, vintage HIMYM<br />- 'The Slutty Pumpkin Returns' (7.08) was supposed to be an episode seven seasons in the making. I thought Katie Holmes played the character very awkwardly and her story with Ted was weak [not to mention there wasn't much slutty about the pumpkin]. However, everything else about the episode was hilarious, from Barney's revelation to Lily's pregnancy brain, this episode had me laughing the whole way through<br />- 'Disaster Averted' (7.09) was one of the best episodes of the series, if you ask me. Great usage of Hurricane Irene to build Lily and Marshall's pregnancy story, Marshall's health insurance story was gold and any episode utilizing the slap bet is a winner in my book<br />- 'Symphony Of Illumination' (7.12) was a dramatic, heartfelt Christmas episode and really displayed a lot of depth for a sitcom. I was very impressed with Cobie Smulders' performance.<br />- The usage of Lily's doppelganger and the two alternate title sequences were very funny in '46 Minutes' (7.14)<br />- 'No Pressure' (7.17) was an all around great episode. The last couple minutes of the episode used the song \\"Shake It Out\\" by Florence + The Machine, and it worked perfectly with the mood the show was trying to convey.<br />- 'Trilogy Time' (7.20) jumped around in the lives of Ted, Marshall and Barney. I loved the pop cultural references from the various times. Ultimately, this was an episode that could have fit right in to the show at its highest point.<br />- 'Now We're Even' (7.21) in a way was similar to the show if you look at it collectively. You knew how it was going to end, but you weren't sure how it would get there. That's why I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Setting aside my problems with the big picture, there were times in Season 7 when the show had a very fundamental problem: it just wasn't all that funny.<br />- 'Tick Tick Tick...' (7.10) was painfully unfunny, even if Neil Patrick Harris' remarkable acting somewhat saved the episode.<br />- Though I moderately enjoyed the short-lived \\"Puzzles\\", Marshall's visit to his father's grave in 'Tailgate' (7.13) was just plain bizarre and anti-climactic.<br />- While the room-by-room storytelling of 'The Burning Beekeeper' (7.15) was original, the stories themselves were underwhelming. I like Mickey Aldrin's biggest character quirk, which is to invent the next great American board game. I don't like much else about him, and with much of this episode's success riding on his beekeeping story, it crashed and burned.<br />- 'Field Trip' (7.05), 'The Rebound Girl' (7.11) and 'Karma' (7.18) just felt like lazy episodes, not in terms of the writing or the acting, but just in the overall execution. To me they were the kind of episodes that you wouldn't turn off if they were on TV, but after awhile they'd just be background noise while you did something else. They just didn't draw me in, & as a huge fan of the show I hate admitting to that.<br /><br />** ** **<br /><br />I think the show has become victimized by its own success. The premise, the way we knew the ending before the story even began, backed the writers into a corner. Once the show started drawing praise and the network kept renewing it, the writers had to find ways to stall. It worked beautifully for awhile, but now the lack of preparation is beginning to show. It's really no one's fault, either, but this is the kind of story that probably needed to wrap up in five or six seasons before it became absurd. I'm hoping Season 7 as a whole is just an isolated miss. I will continue watching the show, but How I Met Your Mother's best days are almost certainly a thing of the past now.<br /><br />Grade: C+much of a reach.

0142410705|4.0|A child prodigy does not necessarily grow up to be a genius adult. Imagine being studied, challenged, and revered as a child only to slowly grow up as a smart, but not genius level, quirky adult. In John Green's An Abundance of Katherines, Colin Singleton is all too painfully aware that his best years might be long behind him.<br /><br />Colin was a child prodigy. Now he is just a quirky young adult who remembers inane facts and has a thing for girls named Katherine. In fact, he has had 19 girlfriends named Katherine, all with their own stories and all with their own reasons for dumping Colin. When K19 dumps Colin, he can't bring himself to just go on with life as usual. His wise-cracking Lebanese friend Hassan has a wonderful solution: a road trip!<br /><br />The two boys climb into the car and head off into the sunset with no real destination in mind as long as it is not home. When they end up in Gutshot, Tennessee, they realize the small town has more to offer than just the body of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. With a motley crew of people centered around a tampon string factory and the impetus for WWI, Hassan and Colin find jobs, first kisses, another Colin, and a theorem that can predict the longevity of relationships and reveals Colin's life as a Dumpee.<br /><br />Have you ever watched a movie where not much happened, but the witty dialogue kept you giggling and hanging on until the end? That is the gist of An Abundance of Katherines. The quirky relationship between Colin and Hassan will have you laughing from start to finish. I can honestly say there isn't much action to this story, but that won't stop you from enjoying the story. Colin's obsession with Katherines and intrigue with Lindsay leads him to develop a mathematical equation that explains the life of a relationship. For a washed up prodigy, his success with the equation is reliant upon his need to feel useful and intelligent again. Both boys are such unique characters, you will wish you knew them in person!<br /><br />This book has some mild intimate content and a decent amount of choice language, but that isn't the reason I would save this book for an older student. The dialogue is so quirky and fast it would most likely be lost on a younger student. It requires a unique sense of humor and appreciation for sarcasm and wit to enjoy this book. If you enjoy those things, you will undoubtedly love this book. If you are looking for a linear story with a beginning, a middle, and a conclusion, this book might not be your cup of tea. The other cool feature of this book is the footnotes. They add to the story in unique ways, giving snarky remarks regarding the story, confirming or denying tidbits of information, and developing the characters further. So don't overlook the footnotes, and if you need a witty book to make you laugh, Katherines is waiting for you!son!<br /><br />This book has some mild intimate content and a decent amount of choice language, but that isn't the reason I would save this book for an older student.

I was drugged up on painkillers, so I thought I would tackle it, as it was a short novel, written very simply.<br /><br />Despite my foggy consciousness, [[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]] held me until I had read it cover to cover. It's a book that can stand beside Hesse's [[ASIN:0486406539 Siddhartha (Dover Thrift Editions)]] for its clarity, simplicity and generous sharing of wisdom. Books like these are rare diamonds scattered among the millions of books that have ever been written.

0345803485|1.0|I can't even express how badly I hated this book. I read literally hundreds of books every year and can usually find something redeemable in all of them even if I don't really connect with the characters or plot. I can appreciate a turn of phrase or plot twist. In 50 SoG I can't find one thing I liked about it. I held out reading this book for a long time but have to admit was intrigued since it was being discussed everywhere I looked. People were RAVING about it. That Christian Grey is so mysterious. That it's a great love story. That the sex is hot and steamy. I feel like I didn't even read the same book! Seriously, I thought maybe I bought some parody of the real book by mistake. Yes, I read the whole thing even though I hated every moment of it because I kept waiting for it to get better to see what all the fuss was about. I agree with all the negative reviews here. I did keep thinking it sounded like it was written by a thirteen-year-old girl. The language is mind-numbingly repetitive. I actually started to feel nauseous every time I read the phrase \\"Oh my.\\" Who says that?? After every thought they have??!! And if this counts for hot and steamy sex, I guess I have a totally over-the-top awesome sex life because I was not remotely aroused or intrigued by any of the sex scenes. I actually found myself skimming over them just to move the book along so I could finish it. They were that stale. Or \\"vanilla\\" as it were. I hated all the characters. Complex?? I think not. There is no plot. And the ending is supposed to be a cliff-hanger setting us up for book 2?? You have got to be kidding me!! I am utterly disappointed and mad at myself for spending money on this book. I'm mad that I contributed to such a lousy writer's bank account. I can't even re-sell it because I got the kindle version. Anyway, PLEASE don't waste your time or money on this book, thinking it's some kind of story that will rock your world or change the way you think about sex/relationships. It's noteven mildly entertaining. I wish Amazon could refund my $9.99 and the 6 hours it took me to read this.

Bottom line, you can save yourself one dollar and just spend $3.99 for the same movie in standard picture quality and sound.  If you decide you like the movie, purchase it on blu-ray so you can get the better picture and sound.  Come on Amazon, get it together, or you'll continue to lose market share to Netflix and Apple....
B004ZN9UZO|3.0|First of all \\"Animals\\" is a great album. I only gave it three stars as a \\"remaster\\". Back in the day, 1977, when this album was released, there used to be these things called \\"8 Track Tapes\\". The LP and all remasters have \\"Pigs On The Wing\\" split in half, Part 1 at the beginning of the album and Part 2 at the end. It was done this way due to time resrictions of LP's. The 8 Track Tape didn't have the same restrictions,each track approximately 12 minutes long. It didn't care if it changed tracks in the middle of a song. The 8 Track Tape I bought of Pink Floyd Animals had the song \\"Pigs On The Wing\\" as one song with a guitar solo in the middle. I refuse to buy any of these so called \\"remasters\\" until they release the original remaster. The song is great and the solo is awesome. Somebody out there needs to get this copy out.

Flynn's characters are shockingly vivid almost to a fault; the characters are so real and believable, they stay alive in your mind long after reading the last page. The real magic of the novel is the vicarious blending of main characters Nick and Amy's twisted psyches. Reading Gone Girl is like waking up from a nightmare in a cold sweat, not being able to shake what you just saw, and reliving the horror every time you close your eyes again.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|entertaining!! keeps my kids entertained for hours. great on long car rides home. no fights or arguements. even the grandmother enjoys this game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun game. Really makes you think to try and get a gold score on every level. There are enough hints to help you, probably a little too many honestly.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|With an asking price this low, I really don't see what there is to complain about in this game. (Generation X was stuck with paying upwards of $30 to $60 on a single game!)<br />For 3 bucks, this game delivers all you could want in a classic RPG. The  music is reminiscent of FF2, but the world map has it's own feel. The battle system is quicker than most typical RPGs, and the UI is clean and extremely easy to understand.<br />I had my tab docked onto the official Samsung  Keyboard and thought to try and use the keys to control the game. Amazingly, the key mapping layout is  not too different from an MMO. A, S, D, and F serve as directional keys for both the UI and walking around the map, and the Enter key serves as the &quot;Confirm&quot; button. The Backspace key also functions with the &quot;Back&quot; action where applicable.<br />I've only played the game for 20 to 30 minutes and am already loving it.<br /><br />This is a classic RPG worth the $3.<br />Thanks, Kotobuki!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like this app because I can easily access the weather. I don't do thunderstorms so when I start to hear thunder I check the weather channel to see how long it will last or if it is even supposed to come through my area

0345803485|1.0|To use the words of the hack, E.L. James, who wrote this book, well, it \\"freaking sucked.\\" Jammed from front to back cover with hackneyed expressions, limp similes, an overabundance of listomania-inspired referencses, and limpid, predictable, generic dialogue copped from whatever daytime drama or inane, soft-core pornography she subscribes to (let the plagiarism suits reign!!!), one could only hope that she'd opted to leave the pages...every shade of unblemished white. Unimaginative plot. Dialogue (these are adults speaking, after all, Ms. James!) that brings new meaning to \\"sophomoric.\\" Hell, moronic is more apt. So, don't be fooled, kids: \\"E. L.\\" is NOT a \\"writer\\" in any sense of the word. This is not literature, but toilet paper diguised as a book. Perhaps, this is a case where a monkey was put in a room with a laptop and this was the result. Of course, the monkey would have an excuse, he was only tapping a keyboard not knowing what the hell he was up to. In Ms. James case, she saw a void in the \\"adult books\\" market wherein no one was writing tripe fraught with every conceivable popular culture reference, inclusive of TRANSCRIBED EMAILS?! A complete waste of paper, and one's time. That it has sold how ever many copies it has sold, well, that only goes to show several things...some people will buy anything that's \\"trendy,\\" there are seemingly countless day-dreaming, misguided, and forlorn single females out there with money to burn on trilogies, and the planet is over-run with simpletons whose idea of a good read is any book that doesn't require them to consult a dictionary.
B006JCC1GO|1.0|this game is so freaking stupid I advise you not to get this game and when you get to level 5 you have to by the full version
B002VWNIAY|4.0|When I received this DVD I could hear it rattling around in the case, but I thought it had simply become dislodged from the holder.  As it turns out, the part of the case that holds the disc was broken,  While it is often cost prohibitive to return items,I will certainly give this a lot of consideration the next time I get damaged packing.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I am so glad that I bought this Album for my listening enjoyment. One of the things that always brings me back to this and other S.P. Albums is the guitar parts as well of course as the overall sounds that they use and get from their instruments. They can sound so heavy, or some parts are more light, and \\"dreamy\\". Just like the way Billy's voice can sing you to sleep, or really scream... that kind of variance exists with the way their instruments sound as well as their guitar sounds.
B007HOIMI4|3.0|It was ok. But i look close at it an it was a little damage. i dont know if its a fake or real blue ray. but it played in my blueray.  So it was ok. SOmeone need to tell me how to tell the diffrent real or fake blue ray disk
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|its the greatest app ever and the best part is its free and works just as great as the paid one!!!!! : p
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the plot, the  cameral work and suspense and  liked the ending.  It wasn't as scary as described  but it did hold my attention trying to figure out where the plot was leading.  I hope Denial Radcliffe  does more movies.
B000FP2OPY|3.0|Product was as described, no complaints there. Love this show and was happy to receive it. I know I chose the cheapest shipping so I wont go on a long rant, Ill just say a few things. I would strongly recommend to up the game in the shipping dep. It seemed like all the time available was taken to get these. I didnt receive them till 2 WEEKS after I ordered them. There really isn't any reason why dvds should take that long, I ship items out to customers all the time, they receive them in less than a week, 1 week tops and thats pretty basic shipping, I usually never spend more than $5 on shipping.<br /><br />Very pleased with the item, great condition, pretty disappointing with shipping time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game.since I got this game I can not get off of it.People thar say you don't like it well y'all have lost y'alls mind people.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great graphics, very challenging, very addictive. Make sure you get temple run cheats for tips, tricks, and cheats on this game.
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|Straight, honest, professional opinion without bringing any love of past albums from this group into perspective...<br /><br />WHO ARE THE MUSIC PRODUCERS THESE DAYS?!?!  (Carly Rae Jepson has the #1 download on iTunes right now???)  Who is actually thinking that this music is damn good enough to put out there to successfully represent a group that is capable and has created much more?  And, who is willing to produce it?<br /><br />Simply put, this album falls short of a group that use to have some talent.  Mediocre at best.  Track lengths are so short, it makes me think they pulled sound bytes together to make an album.<br /><br />Producers and artists should be embarrassed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I was looking for something similar to Dream Zoo to put on my Fire and came across this. It is really cute and easy to follow. I love how the characters help you along. So far, so good! :-)
B003X5UFWW|3.0|I enjoyed the movie at first, but after a while you realize that Ip Man is near invincible. He breezes through every fight and only gets riled up once in the entire film. This inevitably leads to boring fight scenes and a boring protagonist. By the end of the film, even the action had become dull.
B0050QV0RQ|1.0|Don't believe this is a Final Fantasy game. There is no tutorial and the inputs are less than intuitive. The game becomes almost impossible when facing bosses who can kill in one hit. Unless you want to spend unneccessary hours levelling ( aka \\"grinding\\") avoid this app.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|I have to admit, when I first purchased this album and starting listening to each song, I thought to myself, \\"Man, this album really sucks!\\"  I then started listening more and more, and low and behold, I've come to the conclusion that this really is a GOOD album.  Obviously, DLR cannot sing like he used to, and Michael Anthony's awesome background vocals are missing, however, all-in-all, the music is fantastic!  For a measly $5.99, this album is definitely worth it!<br /><br />Order of my favorite songs on the album:<br /><br />1.  Beats Workin' - This song is a jam!  Now, I do have to admit, DLR's vocals are not the greatest on this song (sounds like he's struggling at times), however, I cannot help but think what this song would've been like if VH did this one back in '80-'84, with a much younger DLR and, of course, with Michael Anthony.  If you're not too sure about this song, do yourself a favor and jump directly to the 3:10 minute mark and turn it up.  Just after the small bass part, Eddie comes in with an absolutely classic VH guitar solo that sounds great!  Then go back and listen to the whole song a few times.  The song really is very good!<br /><br />2.  Big River - Another jam!  The beginning kinda reminds me of the crashing and bashing symbols and drums at the beginning Poundcake (obviously, 2 very different songs, but nonetheless, some good classic VH jamming!).<br /><br />3.  Blood & Fire - Good song.  Not as heavy as number 1 and 2 above, but still a pretty good song!<br /><br />4.  Stay Frosty - Goofy lyrics, but man do they really start jamming at 1:10 minute mark.  I also like the fact that the song has 2 great solos.<br /><br />5.  She's the Woman - A remake of VH's 1976 demo song \\"She's the Woman.\\"  DLR's voice obviously sounds very different in 2012 compared to 1976, however, come on, that's 36 friggin' years!<br /><br />6.  Tattoo - Similar to \\"Stay Frosty,\\" the lyrics are goofy, but nonetheless, it's a pretty good song.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are pretty good, too, however, the 6 above are the ones I listen to most.<br /><br />Thanks!
B007Y1ARLA|4.0|After you get past the unfamiliarity that comes with new albums, you'll find that this one is as enjoyable and makes you feel as happy as when you heard \\"Hopes and Fears\\".
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and the two to follow...After reading this series I was lost without Mr. Grey.  This was so well written and the way it was put in order was so amazing.  Cant wait to read more from this author.

B005LAIGQ4|4.0|A film based on a true story which is not one sided, but shows that in everyone one of us there is good.  Drew Barrymore does an excellent job, as usual ... the rest of the cast is also great. A great family movie.
B005LAIH54|4.0|I saw this film in a theatre in March 2012.  I just bought the dvd.  I found it to be very entertaining action film.  Not sure why it was ripped apart by the critics.  I felt the same way about John Carter.  Another good film that was bashed by film critics.  Leave your brain at the door and enjoy the ride.  Defintely for sci-fi fans.
B005LAIGIM|3.0|Like the \\"Portrait of Dorian Grey\\", there is more to the story than one might think.  Eddie Murphy does not age, nor does his ability to make us laugh.  Good job also, Mr. Chabat.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|This is a well made, well acted and enjoyable film. . .but it certainly isn't the greatest thing ever to hit the screen, nor (in my opinion) even the best superhero film.  The Dark Knight, the first Iron Man, the 1978 Superman and perhaps even the 1989 Batman are all arguably superior films. . .but with that said, this is still a highly entertaining film.<br /><br />Predictably, Robert Downey Jr. steals virtually every scene he is in.  The guy has blossomed into an amazing actor and, while the cast as a whole is very capable, he tends to dwarf their performances. . .with one exception. . .Mark Ruffalo.  I am a fan of Edward Norton's work and was disappointed when his contract to play Marvel's green behemoth (probably my favorite superhero when I was growing up), fell apart.  However, it worked out for the best, I think, in terms of fans of this genre.  Ruffalo is simply a superb Bruce Banner - in one film arguably becoming as definitive as Bill Bixby was for the hokey 1970s TV series.  This film is worth seeing for his perfomrance alone. . .throw in the rest of the cast and you have quite an engaging mix!<br /><br />The film is loaded with CGI, but we've reached the technological point in filmmaking where that really doesn't matter anymore.  It all looks very good, even during the very challenging and difficult to execute scenes during the climax.  I'm not, I'm afraid, much of a fan of the Thor storyline nor its cast of characters, so when I realized Loki was going to be the principle villain, I was disappointed, but again - it is incorporated well. . .and that's not really the focus of the film anyway.  The central focus is the interactions of the Avengers themselves, and the great cast makes those interactions an entertaining pleasure to watch.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Incidentally, I do not feel that viewing this movie in the 3D format is necessary.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was a bit surprised when I started reading this novel, thinking it was going into a very dark place. However, it moved along very quickly and evolved into an interesting read.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This true story is so amazing that it reads like a fictional horror story. Unless this man's story had been validated by the author and others, this story would be treated as fiction. It is almost impossible to believe an entire nation's people could be treated so badly their behavior becomes like a wild animal without any sense of normal human emotions. That a single person could become like a wild animal is horrible, but that an entire nation could do so is almost impossible to understand. However this man's story validates the extremes of human desperation that now exist in North Korea. The saddest part is many who have escaped from North Korea are so severely damaged humans they find it impossible to recover, even with the medical, financial, and training assistance provided by the South Korean government. Shin Dong-hyuk's recovery is much better than most, however he clearly still has a long way to go to survive in the modern world.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not too bad of a game. My son and I enjoy playing it. So far no complaints. Worth checking out.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is good for anyntime. love playing it. eventually you will have to have patience but it is good!
160309007X|4.0|Here we have the third and final chapter of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Century.  It takes place 99 years after [[ASIN:1603090002 Chapter 1]] and 40 years after [[ASIN:1603090061 Chapter 2]].  Do NOT read this graphic novel without reading the first two chapters; it is somewhat confusing even if you HAVE read them.  I don't want to divulge too much of the plot, but it isn't giving too much away to say that Orlando attempts to find Mina Murray and Allan Quatermain to battle the antichrist.  Characters from Harry Potter and other works show up here, but they are unnamed due to copyright reasons.  This is a good comic book, albeit less accessible than the volumes that took place in the 19th Century.  The book ends with the third chapter of \\"Minions of the Moon\\", which is a text story that has been serialized in the previous chapters of Century.  It is written in the style of \\"New Wave\\" Science Fiction, which makes it VERY inaccessible and hard to follow.  Many readers will probably just not bother to read it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very addictive. If you don't have the time, don't start the game; you won't put it down! Excellent!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. I would recomend this book only if you have READ the other two. I thought the ending was suprising, but it came together. I hope you read this amazing book.
0345803485|3.0|Erotic literature has been around for a long time.  BDSM - that is bondage, domination, sadomasochism, et. al - has existed as a subset that has endured mostly in the shadows.  The popularity of Fifty Shades of Grey (in this case Book 1 of the trilogy) has cast a much brighter light on this predilection. This bright light took the form of a Kleig as Saturday Night Live did a recent Mother's Day parody on the book as a phenomenon.<br /><br />It's interesting as one explores this literary gendre that certain similarities express themselves.  Consider that among the better known stories, perhaps because it became an art house film, is the 1954 'The Story of O' by Anne Desclos. She penned the tale of love, dominance and submission as Pauline Reage. Similarly, the well known author Anne Rice redefined the well written erotic novel as Ann (A.N.) Rocquelaure in yet another trilogy 'Sleeping Beauty'. This is decidedly not the Disney version. In a more tame vein 'Delta of Venus' and 'Spy in the House of Love' by Anais Nin provided a sensual and carnal perspective for which the author was paid a dollar a page by a patron. As once chooses to write in the shadows perhaps it's better to have a pseudonym. I cannot help but think that 'Fifty Shades' author Erika Leonard (E.L. James) provides a tip of the hat to her predecessors.<br /><br />The similarities, up to a point, end with this courtesy. The prose is trite, stylistically (not content) reminiscent of a teen 'crush' novel. Candidly, having read the much better written aforementioned books, I wondered what all the buzz was about. However, as the novel struggled to gain a foothold I found myself being drawn in to the conflicting emotions of the protagonist main character Anastasia Steele. Young, naive and virginal she stumbles - literally - into the world of her antagonist Christian Grey.  I would characterize the presentation as a simplistic screenplay; sort of like a Sidney Sheldon novel on erotic steroids.  Should this book and trilogy ever make it to the big screen (I'm sure it will) it's likely that  this will be a very adult box office version of 'Twilight' or 'The Hunger Games'.and trilogy ever make it to the big screen (I'm sure it will) it's likely that  this will be a very adult box office version of 'Twilight' or 'The Hunger Games'.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Personally, I'm a terrible writer.  I'm more a math/science person - I tried to like this book - I really really really worked hard at reading it.  So, imagine my relief when a friend of mine, who happens to teach high school English, said to me 'I believe it's the most poorly written book ever published.'<br />Thank God - it's like someone gave me permission to stop reading it.  I must say, that was 3 months ago, and I haven't touched my Kindle since.  I think it's contaminated or something.

Not cornball at all.  My whole family enjoyed it, but my husband thinks he got the most out of it. He said he can't see how any man could walk away from this movie without being a better man.

0062082353|5.0|Forget the literary critiques. A good story is a good story even if told by a stutterer. I am grateful that Kyle was able to become such an effective warrior. He would no doubt quickly stand between me and those who would do me harm. But I cannot help but compare him to another American hero, Sgt. Alvin York. If you do not know who that is, you should. Go learn about him.<br />York only consented to have his story told after being convinced that there was a patriotic good to be done. He refused repeated entreaties from Hollywood over a span of about 20 years, deferring instead to his Christian convictions, i.e.. \\"Things like that are not for buying and selling.\\" Those words, actually spoken by Gary Cooper in the movie about York's life, are a true reflection of York's mind and may be a direct quote.<br />After years of waffling over whether or not we should have invaded Iraq, Kyle's book would, I had hoped, bring it into focus for me. Instead I am filled with a trembling darkness and a sense of foreboding. Something has gone wrong with us. I am a veteran but I hesitate to say it because I do not belong in the ranks of those who were in combat. Most people in uniform never get into actual combat.<br />It will take a better writer, a more sensitive person to decipher how we fell into the trap of repaying the Muslim world back a thousand times over for 911, but that's what we did. America has changed in a myriad of ways and not just because of the wars. I don't think we even know who and what we are anymore. We did not deserve to be attacked on 911. I pray we are never attacked again. The Muslims know there are more Chris Kyles where this one came from. If we are attacked again, now tragically, it will feel right to me.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|There is great detail and suspense with this book. The author describes with such accuracy and detail, that it was like being in the time and place where the characters were. Some parts are a little rough, such as when the characters fight, but as a whole, a very good story about corruption and the ones who are most affected by it.
0812550706|5.0|If you're a fan of great science fiction this book must be read.  For me, this is a novel that has not lost its impact and emotional pull decades after first reading it.  Now it's a classic taught in school.  I wish it had been on the reading list when I was there.  Usually I don't reread books because there are so many books on my reading list but I've reread this one countless times.  Gripping, vivid characters.  A memorable premise.  Moral consequences.  Real life details (going to school, classes, friends and bullies) skillfully blended with futuristic science fiction that is becoming less fictional as time goes on.  One of my favorite books of all time.
B004UG7RQ0|3.0|I don't quite know what rating to give the device.  On one hand, it didn't work for my intended purpose which was to use a non-Apple device in my 2006 Acura TL which has a dealer installed iPod connector.  On the other, I don't think the device is defective because it worked with a Phillips Soundbar.  Unfortunately, the Phillips Soundbar already has an MP3 input, so the CableJive DockBoss is another failed experiment that will go in my electronics graveyard.<br /><br />I strongly advise that you not buy this device if you have an Acura with dealer installed iPod connector; however, it is probably fine for compatible devices.
B00881VLCE|5.0|2thumbs up :). great way to kill some time, and the music is very soothing. There are a ton of free puzzle packs to choose from. Overall a fun app.
B007V508CC|1.0|This is my review from the MP3 version.  Not sure why they can't put these all together but here it is:<br />Really?<br />This is M5?<br />This album does not even come close to quality that M5 has favored us from their last albums. It is as if someone cloned them, locked the originals away, and had these falsifications try to do something between Rap and 80's Disco.<br />Please!<br />The album is ruined completely by the first two songs outright. Payphone had potential and it was going good until they inserted the rappist in the middle and completely wrecked whatever promise it ever had. Why the RAP? Why the foul language is needed I don't know. It's like they need to cuss to express themselves and it dampens the strength of their music. Even the Album Artwork sucks, an indicator of what to expect inside.<br />Two things they need to do for their next album.<br />1. NO RAP/THUMP-A-CUSS. Guys you can sing and well but the rap has got to be omitted.<br />2. Change your theme. I applaud the songs and musical prowess, but the bad relation, girlfriend cheating me/me cheating her, sorrowful drone is getting old. When you cover other peoples songs you shine. Take that with some fresh lyrics of your own and you will soar.<br />Don't get me wrong, folks, There are some good songs on the album, but not enough to merit the name Maroon 5 has earned from past endeavours.<br />Not recommended for all of the hype I read and saw, please guys go back and re-think yourselves before venturing out into the music world again...<br />Sad

B000OIZUW6|3.0|First, let me say I liked the read of Jackdaws by Ken Follett. I have read a lot of his works though, and I would not say it is his best work.  Compared to most writers though, even a weak effort by Follett goes a long way towards greatness.  Generlly, I get a much better feel for the era or the history of a piece from him.  This was just not rife with the history as usual for him.<br /><br />I will say that bhe did dress the story up with drama though.  He is an excellent portryer of characters and the good and bad guys where the right color hats throughout the book.  But, I will say that the contrasting conscience builds slowly towards lrge pictures of desperation as well in this book.  I wish there had been more.<br /><br />In fact, I wish Follett had given more throughout this story.  I felt as though Tarentino had taken short cuts to rewrite history for the sake of character and thrills a little.  Agood beginner for Follett, but maybe a little less so for avid fans.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria was a character I found so easy to identify with in high school. I was so excited when I found the complete series and bought it. I was especially happy that the DVD included not only all of the episodes, but also the two movies and even some behind-the-scenes content that was pretty cool to see. I think this has been one of my best Amazon purchases so far.
1401937519|5.0|I found the book to be credible and honestly written. It was believable and not written with any agenda. It is well worth reading if you would like insight into what is ahead of all of us and confirmation of why we are all here.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|This is a fun and catchy pop song. Perfect for when you want to hear something upbeat, especially in the car. I also got a great price on it (.25) so it was more than worth the download.
B004NSUXHU|4.0|Quite excellent Christmas fayre. Very well done especially as characters kept to character and story line did not wander off key. Look forward to part 3.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Classic style! Some things never change, Thank Goodness. They've still got it!!! Smooth as butter and great songs, as usual. Really enjoyed this new CD.

B0060AY85C|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B008EOLHH4 Folsom on Fire]] and an avid reader of African-American history, I love that Ms. Morrison has enlightened us once again.  Even in the year 2012 we are still learning what really happened in the lives of African-Americans of the past.  The past does indeed shape our future.  Understanding and learning from the past can make us all . . . black and white, better people.  Frank Money's inward journey  on the road of self-respect and self-esteem is one that many African-American men and women have walked on.  Some of us have lost our way, but with Ms. Morrison's ever guiding light, we shall all make it one day.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This video which celebrates the 25th anniversary of Les Miserables is absolutely amazing. The talent and production is spectacular, I think it was better than the actual stage production. The finale brings together stars of past performances which is a delight to see. I wish this was available on CD.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Imagine it is 1982 all over again.  The soaring sonic torrent that closes \\"Sole Survivor\\" is blasting out of the FM airwaves.  Guitarist extraordinaire Steve Howe is playing like a man possessed against a backdrop that includes the Carl Palmer's peerless percussion, Geoff Downes' ethereal keyboards, and John Wetton's thumping bass.  This is music that sears memories.<br /><br />Fast forward your I-pod to thirty years later.  Asia has a new record out, \\"XXX,\\" and the group sounds like they've been preserved in a time capsule.  I mean that as a compliment, though.  \\"Tomorrow the World,\\" the track that kicks things off, is a scorching musical adventure that is as lean, energetic, and fiery as anything off their first album.  The ballads, such a \\"Bury Me in Willow,\\" \\"Faithful,\\" \\"Ghost of a Chance,\\" represent some of the best material Asia has ever done too.<br /><br />I consider Asia's recent efforts - \\"Phoenix\\" and \\"Omega\\" to be pretty strong -- but the new album takes things up a notch and the band really manages to conjure up the blistering energy and cohesiveness that made the first album so memorable.  To my mind, only \\"Judas\\" and \\"Reno\\" fail to capture the heat of yesteryear, but the acoustic version of \\"I Know How You Feel\\" (bonus edition only) exceeds my wildest dreams.  With \\"XXX,\\" Asia has come back . . . with a vengeance.<br /><br /> Scott O'Reilly is the author of:<br />\\"Yes and Philosophy\\"
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Suzanne Collins does a remarkable job maintaining the perspective of a 16 year old girl throughout, slowly exposing her, mostly by way of soul-bursting shocks of reality, to a world of fascist cruelty whose politics she cannot fathom, but has no trouble accepting.  While these reality bursts frighten her to the core, sometimes bringing her to the edge of catatonic withdrawal, they strengthen her as well, though not to the point where she ever makes intelligent decisions.  On the contrary, she makes unlikely friends, her courage in the face of desolation and hopelessness inspiring them to help her in spite of her questionable choices.  She never quite grows up, but her story will grab and hold you nonetheless.

B005LAIHSG|4.0|\\"Evil\\" Queen Ravenna (played by actress Charlize Theron) seems to get more air time than Snow White, and this movie should rightfully named after the Queen! Snow White gets to don about 3 costumes throughout the movie, while I couldn't keep up with Queen Ravenna's dazzling wardrobe collection.<br /><br />I've noted that until the time Snow White is about to be summoned to be killed, the Queen must have had provided excellent dental care and a cosmetic consultant to attend to Snow White even though the latter was locked up in a tower. Snow White had all the time in the world to wax and shape her pristine eyebrows! She has nice curled eyelashes too. Wow! You didn't think I'll miss that, did you? Snow White has polished finger-nails, all cut, prim and proper, no long nails despite her years in jail. Good hygiene there! Oh, at least, the movie makeup artists did try to fill in some dirt on the sides of her finger-nails! Ha ha!<br /><br />What I like about about this movie:<br /><br />(1) Everything about actress Charlize Theron! She's hot!<br /><br />(2) Kristen Stewart's hot too and plays Snow White well!<br />  Kristen Stewart's acting has improved tremendously since that boring<br />  \\"Twilight\\" series! Then again, Kristen is naturally sexy, all the cameras<br />  needed to do was zoom in on her pretty face. Nothing more needs to be said!<br /><br />(3) Luxurious costumes, especially the Queen's!<br /><br />(4) Captivating background scenes.<br /><br />(5) Good graphics.<br /><br />What I don't like about this movie:<br /><br />(1) That comical kissing scene between the Huntsman (played by actor Chris<br />  Hemsworth) and the dead Snow White (played by Kristen Stewart). In this<br />  scene, the Huntsman said something like \\"you remind me of my wife\\".... I<br />  almost burst out laughing in the cinema! He could very well be saying:<br />  \\"Little Snow White, you look like my little sister! Let's just hope you don't<br />  transmit any cold sores or viruses from remnants of that poison apple when I<br />  kiss you on your lips!\\"<br /><br />(2) lack of sufficient battle scenes.<br /><br />(3) cheesy and unrealistic battle scenes: eg.

B0068RHGJM|5.0|My 13 year old son loved this CD. Quite a different European flair to rock and very interesting to listen to. My son plays electric guitar and was able to pick out and practice some different chords from listening to Nightwish.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|I have purchased from Amazon.Com many Pink Floyd CD'S and 1 DVD  -- Only 1 time there happened to be a defect on the DVD -- but your entire return and exchange process was seamless and painless  --- Pink Floyd and Amazon.com are the BEST-- what a team  -- fyi, I have also purchased Division Bell which I had mailed to my fiancee whom is located in another state.. if you want me to comment on Animals  --- PIGS, DOGS and SHEEP  -- us Pink Floyd addicts know whom they truly are.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|My favorite album of the summer so far.  Simply stunning.  I am a fan of Hansard with The Frames and with Swell Season, so I had to give this album a try.  Such an honest and beautiful album.  I have already gifted it to 4 people- who fell in love with it as well. Give it a try!
B003Y5H5C4|5.0|I have to say this was a really funny movie. What a ride from start to finish. You are always laughing at one of the many talented actors. The movie is really just a fun idea and they did a great job with it. I mean just think about if you got a bomb strapped on you and you had to rob a bank, so you didn't blow up. If the cops were to get you, you'd have a pretty good excuse on why you robed the bank. (The bank Robbery scene might be my favorite scene) I highly recommended to watch this for any audience who likes to laugh. Kind of along the lines of pineapple express type of humor id say.
B0084RSYEK|4.0|Okay, so I enjoyed Eddie Murphy's Raw, but I enjoyed this too.  Eddie Murphy has come a long way, and I feel that his movies provide reliable entertainment value, especially now when the bathroom humor has left me with my youth.<br />This movie has a good story, and it wrapped up nicely in a laughter invoking package through to the end.<br />I watched while laughing with my girlfriend, and enjoyed a good neutral movie (chick-flick v. man-show).<br />I recommend it for a friday night when there's no plans for going out.
0345803507|5.0|Love the entire series, and the storyline, the way the entire story unfolded.  Loved the steaminess, romance, and fantasy all leading up to a wonderful story of a tough childhood and what the love of the appropriate woman can do and play in that role of healing and loving.

B007FLHW3K|2.0|I'm afraid that I must modify my review from below.  I loved this product, but out of 3 of them that were purchased in the family only one remain working.  I bike a lot and mine stopped working in a about a month.  The other one on another bike that gets less miles on it last 2-3 months.  The thing that breaks is the wire connection between the battery pack and the light.  It is a shame b/c I loved this product and nothing really compares to it for a wheel light.<br /><br />Older review: It looks cool and is very noticeable-I think everyone looks at my bike when I pass.  I have a monkeyelectric on the front and a nite ize spokelight one the back.  When the bike is parked at an intersection the monkey electric is noticeably brighter than the nite ize, but when the tires are spinning at 20 mph the gap is much narrower.  If monkeyelectric was only $25 than I would have one on each wheel instead of the nite ize so that I could use rechargeable batteries rather than the cr2016 of the nite ize.  Besides the price, my chief complaint with it is the battery pack the mounts around the wheel hub with zip ties does not stay firmly in place (it is supposed to be opposed to the light)-it by no means comes loose to fall off it just is not exactly opposed to the light.  I did not feel an unbalanced wheel while riding but I could feel it simply by rotating the wheel by hand.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|I've been sitting here for 10 minutes wondering where to begin.  I'm not very good at reviewing books and my grammar isn't the best but if I can dissuade one sane person from picking up this book my attempt will be worth it.  I downloaded this book because of all the hype that surrounds it and because it made the New York Times Best Sellers list.  I usually avoid books that have been 'over hyped' as I am normally disappointed but I figured it had to have some substance if it could top the New York Times Best Sellers List.  Well, how wrong I was.  This book is the most undeserving of the hype and praise that has been bestowed upon any book ever.  I only finished it as I'm not a quitter and I thought something had to happen eventually - wrong again.<br /><br />After reading the first few chapters I had to check to see if I had accidentally downloaded an 'unedited' version.  The writing really comes across as if a teenager wrote it to spice up the lacking love lives of her friends.  It is very immature and so repetitive with all the 'Holy Crap', blushing, lip biting, eye rolling and chin lifting that smothers every page.  Most of all (despite the lack of a concrete storyline) it is unbelievable.<br /><br />The author expects us to believe that Ana, the naive 21 year old virgin (who has never masturbated incidentally), is about to graduate from college without ever being hindered by having her own email account.  Seriously?  In 2011 she's never set up a generic email address?  And our virginal heroine loses her virginity to Christian without any awkwardness or self consciousness and manages to achieve an orgasm on the very first encounter - timed perfectly with Mr Suave himself.  In fact, Ana manages to go on to orgasm at any opportunity, on demand, in her sleep and always perfectly in sync with Christian and she's always ready for him.  Again, seriously?  The characters lack depth and aren't all that likeable as a result.  I didn't really care what happened to her - I just wanted her to stop talking from the perspective of her 'inner goddess' and 'subconscious'.<br /><br />For all the soccer mum cougars out there I hate to rain on your parade but this isn't erotica.  This is a Mills & Boone romance novel where the main characters engage in sex that is described in more detail rather than 'flying to the stars' together.  I have heard that there may be a movie and I have no doubt that for once the movie will be better than the book.  It certainly can't be any worse.  I read another review who described the trilogy as 'literary crack' and I must agree as although this book failed to tick so many boxes I will probably read the other two just to see what happens next and to see if Ms James finally managed to find an editor.<br /><br />One final bright spot - I did quite enjoy the email banter but on the whole I would only recommend this book to someone who . . . . well, no - I just don't recommend this book!just wanted her to stop talking from the perspective of her 'inner goddess' and 'subconscious'.<br /><br />For all the soccer mum cougars out there I hate to rain on your parade but this isn't erotica.

B008EDGBW6|1.0|I'm not hating on Chris but this CD is just crap. Overly produced junk. He needs to take more time between Cd's and actually make something more interesting and stop trying to look and sound all \\"street\\". Its time to focus on making better music Mr. Brown. And this is not it
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I could speed read through the first 50 pages or so because it was a story so predictable and told so many times before that I thought I had read this already, but I knew I hadn't.  No surprises here, sex is okay, but I've had better.  I hope the readers both men and women take it for what it is..fantasy!  There are very few Sebastian's out there and most of the audience will never meet them.
B000641Z90|1.0|Well it's hard to say how the video is. I was quite looking forward to watching it. Only a slight problem. I didn't receive the order  Apart from that minor detail, it was very good.

B000ZLFALS|5.0|Very good movie. Lots of great beatles songs! Nice story line and a moving picture. Quite enjoyable, sure to bring back good memories!
B004QL7K6G|3.0|This film is a letdown because I hold Paul Rudd to a higher standard.  Rudd's movie star good looks and affable manner leavens some of the outrageousness of the films he's in namely \\"Role Models\\" and \\"Dinner for Schmucks\\".  This isn't a bad film just decidedly average.  There are some laughs to be sure but not enough for me to recommend it.  The plot and setting of \\"Wanderlust\\" leave you with a sense of been-there-done-that.  This is kind of surprising because the director is David Wain who Rudd collaborated successfully in the past and produced by Judd Apatow.  All I can say is I'm looking forward to the spin-off of \\"Knocked Up\\" which Rudd co-stars with Leslie Mann and directed by Apatow this holiday season.

1609611543|5.0|I have Celiac disease, and have been gluten-free for 18 months. I thought that I had a good understanding of gluten-related issues, but I learned a lot in this book -- both in terms of the history of the wheat-modifications that have occurred over the past 50 years, and in practical terms for eating healthily. I was especially impressed with the information on obesity and on diabetes. This one (relatively) simple change to a person's diet can mean a dramatic change in health and in quality of life. I heartily recommend this book, whether or not you think you have a gluten problem. The case is very strongly made that this would be an incredibly healthier nation if our food were not so full of techno-engineered wheat products. Unless you have no health issues whatsoever, I highly recommend this book.
B000005RRP|5.0|The booklet included in this 25th anniversary edition is the key to the album. Page 6 mentions Roger  Glovers taping of a Jam that came up with some key material. The only reason this tape was not included is lack of space: so why not another disc??<br />  Possibly the most criticised song on this album is \\"Anyone's Daughter\\" .The booklet indicates that this song with its brilliant guitar work and witty lyrics is anything but filler( I'd love to see many other guitarists copoy this style).This is another album that shows the Mach 2 brilliance.<br />  \\"Fireball\\" is of course the stand out track, but what is evident is how Glovers' mixes give an insight into the creative life.I had always thought the start was a lift well recording changed, but the booklet explains what i is, but I guess some already knew.The Revox he had used, shows how much the solo \\"reversal\\" sound gives an interesting twist on Ritchies creativity.And track 13, the so called \\"Noise Abatement society tapes\\" shows a musical skill that few can muster.And overall, the remixes work brilliantly, great sound and superb feel.Rogers notes in page 19 to 21 are vital for an overview. Brilliant work from a great band.Much could be said and written, just listen.

B0081L37Z0|5.0|Watched this on 4th of July since it was so hot out.  It is CLEARLY not rated to be a younger teen movie, and we did not and will not let our 14 yr old watch it.  However, she wasn't here and it was hilarious for us!<br /><br />I'm not going to do a cinematic breakdown, it's highly entertaining, and you don't have to have a clue or even like the old 21 Jump Street show to appreciate it.  There are many one liners, and we were both in tears laughing when the duo got stopped and asked for a hall pass by the gym coach - TOO FUNNY!<br /><br />Also, keep your eyes open for some great cameo appearances!  I think we'll be buying this one on DVD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I spend a lot of time playing and dont have to wait for more games to load if I get bored. I can just switch over to the next game..it is great to have games that give you point to meet and it brings out that wanting to get a higher score the next time.

1594203059|4.0|I just purchased Ferguson's \\"Civilisation.\\"  This not a review of the book.  I enjoy the author.  I was a little surprised at his somewhat snide reference to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the Preface (p. xxiv).  I don't think much about the medical science or FDR's doctors in 1945. I don't think that 63 was a ripe old age.  As far as his serving \\"nearly four full terms before his death\\"--he was barely three months into his fourth term.  I guess his editors missed that one.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is not worth the read.  Lots of sex, but very little to the story line.  Likeable female character, at least she showed some backbone and stood up for herself finally.

1594203334|1.0|I heard about this book during an interview on NPR. I am a teacher and am expecting my first baby this month. I have  read all kinds of parenting books. This book was annoying. Pamela Druckerman goes on and on about how French parents are perfect. For example, at the end of the second to last paragraph of page 93, \\" French parents listen to their kids all the time.\\" top of page 84 \\" French mothers aren't trying to help their kids' cognitive development or make them advance in school. Rather, they believe that awakening will help their kids forge \\"inner psychological qualities such as self assurance and tolerance of difference\\"... Way to generalize.<br /><br />She praises the French as model parents and generalizes to the point where it is disgustingly obnoxious. There are amazing parents in every country as there are terrible parents. The ideas behind this book are found in most authoritative parenting books. She could have condensed this material to 3 chapters.<br /><br />And her decision to have a three some for her husbands birthday puts the cherry on top as far as her model parenting goes.
B000002AP1|5.0|I mean really, this will never go out of style! This album has more of an old school blues rock feel.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very interesting idea, with both big and small mysteries to keep the reader engaged. I enjoyed how the story unfolded and grew in scope over the course of the five books. I also enjoyed how the protagonist changed periodically, seeming to evolve along with the story. The antagonist(s) were not one-dimensional, with the reasoning behind their \\"bad\\" intentions becoming clearer as the story expanded.<br /><br />As other have mentioned, the main detriment was that as the series continued the writing style became over descriptive and the plot slowed considerably as the series progressed.<br /><br />Definitely worth purchasing - enjoyed it the first time through and currently enjoying the second read! It also left a lot of questions unanswered , so I will be eager to read the follow up novels!
1433502410|5.0|Excellent clean translation without yielding to so-called non-sexist language.<br />Introduction to individual books very helpful while notes on individual passages<br />insightful.<br />The ESV is an excellent tool for any serious young(or old) Bible student.It's the best study Bible I've seen. The online access is a bonus.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|when i first read the discription of this book i was tricked into beliving this was going to be a good book as im sure many other people were tricked into beliving but im almost half way through and let me tell you this book is literly one of the worst books i have ever read and there's really hardley any books that i read that are this crappy and badley written.<br />â¢characters:they have such rediculosly stupid and ugly names i dont know if the author just didn't spend that much time on  choosing names for charactrs or she has really bad taste in names.now about the actual characters travis seems like a cocky douch who needs major anger managment clases thh girl seems like a really nieve bitch because she's leading him on instead of giving him a straight up answer and naive because she puts up with such a violent idiot. also what kind of stupid nickname is pigeon (or pidge) if my boy friend ever called me such an ugly & unfeminine name i would slap him<br /><br />â¢setting:same three places over & over again gets really anoying after a while<br />â¢plot:really cute and romantic in the first chapter but now being so far into it its just too many Älecheys and literly the whole dam book is back and forth back and forth back of should i be with her/him yes i should no i shouldnt its like really make up your dam mind.<br /><br />over all the book sucked and it was extremly unrealistic.booooooo to this book and the author who wrote it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I did a search for when the next book in this series would be out and was really surprised this one didn't have at least 4 stars, if not 5. This is my first review, but I really feel compelled to recommend this book. I like both romance and supernatural genres -- I would put these books in the same category as the Sookie Stackhouse books. There's a great romance, but I think it's secondary to the bigger plot of the fate of all the creatures. In most romance novels, the hero and heroine don't get together until the end, and --though I love them and find them a guilty pleasure-- typical romance novels are predictable. In this book, the romantic tension is settled pretty early and is secondary to the larger action. It is a long book, but I found it riveting and could barely put it down. I thought it was a very smart book, too. The conversations about Darwin and Newton and magic and alchemy are definitely not typical of the genre. I wasn't surprised to read the author's bio and discover she's a college professor who has written textbooks. I've been waiting anxiously for the sequel, though I expect there will be a huge cliffhanger since we know there will be three total books.
B00486070K|3.0|What can you say about this product that it's a apple. A bit costly for what it does, but I rather buy that would work for my Mac-Air.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book and cannot wait to read the second novel in the series. This book is well written and had me rooting for the characters. It is written so much better than 50 shades of Grey series. Must read for me and already pre-ordered the second novel.

B007JNR518|5.0|I got this yesterday and watched it last night with my wife, one of her favorite Robert Redford movies. First off let me say that the DTS-MA audio was great, the surround sound when implemented was enveloping and the Thomas Newman score was presented nicely. About the first 40 minutes was presented in a box style (1:85:1), borders all around to convey (I guess) life in the city. Once the movie begins the move out to Montana the picture opens up to the more satisfying 2:39:1 aspect ratio and the vistas are just marvelous to look at. Generally the film looks good and is a huge upgrade from the ugly non-anamorphic DVD released in the early days of DVD. However I would have to nitpit with the element used in the mastering of the Blu-ray even though the back cover claims an all-new digital restoration. While some scenes look quite sharp, others look out of focus or soft. Nonetheless we are happy to finally own it on Blu-ray. I hate the cover art but understand why they felt it necessary to photoshop Redford's bust into the artwork. The extras are very brief (each lasting a few minutes) and are in SD. Finally, I did not see this film in the theater so I do not know if the inclusion of a new scene in the Blu-ray version was in the original or not. If you are a fan you'll know it when you see it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Love it! Works great, has some amazing features.  I'm going to be able to uninstall some other photo apps, this does it all!
B003ES61EE|5.0|I have used both lens pens from Nikon[[ASIN:B00006JN3G Nikon 7072 Lens Pen Cleaning System]] and Amazon. In short, I prefer the one from Amazon.<br /><br />I own few SLR cameras, and several compact cameras. So, my review is based on having to clean a variety of lens types.<br /><br />The Amazon Lens Pen is better because this one has two heads - one big (round) and the other smaller (triangular). The smaller one is very useful for compact cameras especially those all weather, tough cameras with small lens window. It is also triangular in shape and good for reaching those corners and hard to reach surfaces.<br /><br />The Amazon version is also slight cheaper than Nikon's which makes it easier choice.
B006ON41FC|3.0|its really fun. I love gathering nuts and doing the challenge thingies. now I'm kind of bored of it. I wish it could have different levels or something.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|i really love this game.  it is very addicting.  the only thing that gets annoying is that sometimes it will get stuck when you are cutting the fruit and you have to shut it down and turn it back on.  but i still love it...you should get it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This collection is rather entertaining...is a great solo game to have when low on memory...gives kids a nice selection to choose from and encourages the player to play competively so as to open new game. What I like the most is its not in your face like some games that make the next level all hard and all. Plus just for checking in daily they give you an incentive to return...money or points as coins..
0394873742|5.0|My son has become addicted to Richard Scarry's Busy Town and Cars Trucks and THings that Go so naturally when I saw a \\"big word book\\" it was a must have.  When the box arrived I thought, wow they used a big box to ship a book.... then we opened the box and found a HUGE 3ft tall book!  It's awesome!!! My son sprawls out over the floor and looks at all the pictures and talks to them, we even prop the book open in the corner of his crib so he can look at it while he falls asleep.  The whole Richard Scarry collection is so great for learning, we have to read them and talk about them every day.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Dying to be Me is the best book that I have ever read.  Only those who are anxious to see beyond their religious beliefs that are not always correct and really want to know truth will enjoy this book. In other words you must have an open mind.  Everyone that I have told about this book has all agreed with me that it is the BEST!
B006H8BIIM|5.0|This is a good game.  It is very similar to an older flash game called \\"The Space Game.\\"<br /><br />It does cost an extra 99 cents if you want to instantly unlock the extra features.<br /><br />But if you play through the game you can unlock the features with the points you earn.  Other people reviewing say you can't get past third level without paying or grinding for those points.  I just say those people are not good at playing this game.  I'm already half way through the campaign without grinding, and been unlocking features as I progress through the campaign. Though since I played an earlier flash game similar to this I already knew what strategies work for this style of game.<br /><br />If your looking for a slightly different style of strategy game, this may fit the bill.  But if you have access to a computer, look up \\"The Space Game\\" on the internet to see if you would enjoy playing this style of game before buying.  Granted the flash game has nothing when it comes to graphics when compared to this game.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I have this game on my kindle fire and it works great! I don't have any problems with. It never freezes and it always loads quickly! I give it two thumbs up. ;)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app has everything a person could need to study and enjoy the holy word of God. There are numerous versions of scripture you can choose from. Very easy to navigate and has a free audio feature allowing you to listen to scripture while you do housework or whatever.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|I luv this album. I listen to every track without skipping a single one. My favorite tracks are: Bassline, Till I Die, Mirage, 2012, Biggest Fan, and Sweet Love. Even though to me some of the track sound a little like house music, I still think this is must for Chris Brown fans.
B007L96VCY|5.0|Ram is one of those hidden classic gems. Very under rated at the time it was released and actually panned by many critics. Although lyrically vacuous in some places, musically it is superior with many great songs. The song, \\"Another Day\\" was released as a single but not included in the LP. A mistake as that song came from the RAM sessions and when included adds even more gravitas to the production. The remastering is excellent!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is absolutely one of the most &quot;addicting&quot; game out! I love it, my kids love it! Most def a keeper! Wished I could get on my LG Optimus but its great on tablet!

0316023744|3.0|One wonders: Why do we need yet another two-inch-thick recounting of familiar events with a London bias?<br /><br />Antony Beevor has shown himself to be a fine writer in the past, but falls flat here. He offers the typical British disregard of the Pacific, with inadequate, incomplete and sometimes inaccurate coverage of major events. Generally the narrative lacks spark and flair. As a writer he seems to be stuck in a middle ground between intimate portraiture and sweeping majesty. It's not clear what his contribution is, following in the wake of Hastings, Andrews, Gilbert, Keegan, Murray/Millett, Commager via Miller, and others. And at the end, where he reaches for significance, he can summon only banality and sloppy logic.<br /><br />It's only fair to ask a reader to review a book on the merit of the author's own words. The book's concluding notes are where it needs to come together and resonate. Mr. Beevor's conclusion is a major disappointment, a wholly inadequate close to a work of such length.<br /><br />* \\"Having been given the mantle of the `good war,' the Second World War has loomed over succeeding generations far more than any other conflict in history.\\" Really? How might we ever measure that? Loomed where, over whom and how? The U.S. Civil War didn't loom, did it? But I suppose a Brit can only speak for Brits. A pointless bit of sophistry, this.<br /><br />* This one's even worse: \\"Although it may have ended in overwhelming defeat for the Nazis and Japanese, the victory conspicuously failed to achieve world peace.\\" Was that really any nation or leader's aim in the war? The author's proposition is utterly novel and startling: The magical conjuration of a benign international order is the metric by which we measure wars. Many thoughtful people are satisfied that the Allies' destruction of not one but two evil empires, and their eventual transformation by the victors into peaceful democratic nations, was and continues to be a conspicuous success and a net gain for humanity. Maybe he's trying to make a name for himself as a critic. Unfortunately, his argument is inane and beside the point.<br /><br />The author tries to support the WW2-as-failure line with: \\"First there were the latent civil wars across Europe and Asia.... Then there was the Cold War.\\" Yes, all that, it seems, was the fault of FDR, General Marshall, Hap Arnold, and Chester Nimitz. Or was it? The author, sadly, can't help himself from finally revealing his scapegoat: \\"And we can never forget that the sequence of struggle in the Middle East began with mass Jewish immigration into Palestine, following the liberation of the camps.\\"<br /><br />That's right, Mr. Beevor appears to believe that the \\"conspicuous failure\\" of WW2 was substantially in part the fault of the Jews.<br /><br />* \\"Some people complain that the Second World War still exerts a dominating influence nearly seven decades after its end.\\" They do? Who are the complainers? What what dire \\"dominating influence\\" is the author even talking about?<br /><br />* \\"No other period in history offers so rich a source for the study of dilemmas, individual and mass tragedy, the corruption of power politics, ideological hypocrisy, the egomania of commanders, betrayal, perversity, self-sacrifice, unbelievable sadism and unpredictable compassion.\\" Yes indeed. All those things are ripe for study. One wishes the author had studied them rather than simply trod rather flatly through much-discussed and well-understood events. (And don't we all prefer our power politics to be uncorrupted?)<br /><br />* \\"There is, nevertheless, a real danger of the Second World War becoming an instant reference point.\\" Maybe this bit of mysterious inscrutability means that people might talk about it too much. Or that Brits might load up our bookshelves with too many overly long books. It was unclear to me how a \\"reference point\\" might be dangerous, but then the author elaborated: The danger, he says, is that \\"leaders of democraciescan become prisoners of their own rhetoric, just like dictators.\\" One looks in vain for any inkling of what this might mean, or support for the idea that it's an issue of relevant concern. I guess he's suggesting that Allied nations have become so proud of their victory in WW2 that they've enslaved millions by boasting about it? The Greatest Generation as opiate of the masses? Can someone help me here?<br /><br />* \\"When we dwell on the enormity of the Second World War and its victims, we try to absorb all those statistics of national and ethnic tragedy. This makes us overlook the way the Second World War changed everyone's lives in ways impossible to predict.\\" What exactly are we overlooking as we try to absorb the numbers, the tragedy? I always thought the acting of \\"dwelling,\\" and the study of statistics, tended to push in the direction opposite of \\"overlooking\\" things. The author seems to suggest that the act of studying war is to become ignorant of it. Is he actually suggesting we would have learned more about WW2 if he hadn't written this book?<br /><br />* As the truisms, nonsequiturs, sentimentalities and banalities pile up, the entire book begins to creak and crumble for lack of coherence. The book is brought to a merciful end on page 782-783, but it's here that the nonsense reaches its crescendo. The author closes with a perfectly asinine anecdote plucked from a 1945 French intelligence report. The story concerns a German soldier's wife who fell in love with a French POW assigned to work at their farm in Germany. The significance of this romance across enemy lines is rather opaque, to be polite, but the author seems to think it raises Large and Momentous Questions important enough to close his 783-page narrative. After three readings, I still can't tell what they are, or what it has to say about decisions by Hitler and Stalin. Maybe you can puzzle it out: \\"Would her difficult journey [smuggling herself out of Germany to Paris] have been in vain, even if she had not been picked up by the police? Had her lover given her the wrong address because he was already married? And had he returned home, as quite a few did, to find that his wife had had a baby in his absence by a German soldier? It is, of course, a very minor tragedy in comparison to everything else which had happened further east. But it remains a poignant reminder that the consequences of decisions by leaders such as Hitler and Stalin ripped apart any certainty in the traditional fabric of existence.\\" Where I come from, we call this kind of speculative bloviation a \\"reach.\\" And yet here they are, a bland truism masquerading as profound, and constituting the last words of the book.<br /><br />The research the author marshaled is as voluminous as any of his many competitors, but one has the distinct feeling that, having marshaled it, he was left with no idea what it added up to, how to deploy it via narrative or analysis, or had insufficient time to develop a cogent point of view to leave the reader with. Facing all the competition from several superior books, well established and recent alike, who can blame a writer for flinching a little and losing his nerve?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Leaves you breathless -  I had to keep going back to refresh myself on what was happening.  This story is really about a young man being abused and finding his way back. Christian is probably like many young men - except he found the love of his life to lead him to the light.  I loved all of it. I will reread this after a while and I'm sure I will pick up on somethings that I missed while rushing thru  the book.
0345803507|3.0|Heard all the raves and publisity about this book, I felt the book was over rated. Just another love story with a little twisted sex.
B008CWD17M|2.0|I was really hoping for something more than the mediocre last couple of albums. The reviews here and in the paper tout this as a good comeback but, alas, I don't see that.<br /><br />The tunes are all forgettable and add nothing to the band's repertoire.<br /><br />Asia is one of my favorite bands of all time but this is a waste of an album and my time. Not even one track is hit material; definitely nothing I'd want to listen to more than once.<br /><br />What a shame.

B001D0DQUC|4.0|This is a classic film available at a discount price.  Excellent value.  Definitely, worth owning a copy to share with your kids.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|First, I must say, I'm a little perturbed by all the \\"snobbery\\" I see in some of these reviews. Who give a flying sh*t-bird how many times the author used certain words or phrases? It all smacks of pretentious author snobbery, when in reality the only opinion that matters is the individual reader at the time of reading.<br /><br />Besides, a book can be eloquently written, but boring as hell. And the opposite can, and most certainly, is true. I read a good deal, and I wasn't off-put by the authors word choice or euphemisms. Why? Because this series sucked me into the lives of the characters.<br /><br />*Grammar alone could never do that.*<br /><br />Okay, rant over. Here's what I posted on my site about this 1st book:<br /><br />Steamy, romantic, explores the depths of trust in intimate relationships.<br /><br />Of the three books in the series, I found this one to be the most risque', mainly because the author had the cajones to put a few things in print that I've never seen before. I applaud her courage, and think that the taboos covered in this book were well done (that is, with honesty and without bias)and made the book feel more like a literary journey into the private lives of real people-- and less like the \\"chic porn\\" that some critics claim.
0679805273|4.0|I buy these books every year for the graduating seniors in my life as a tradition. I usually go to a physical bookstore to pick them up, but I was short on time this year and Amazon's always good for helping me out with that. They came quickly and on time, but I was bummed that the edges were crushed because the box they were packaged in was too large, allowing them to move around a bit.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After I finished this last in the series, my thoughts turned sad. I wasn't ready to give up Christian or his kinky f**kery!<br /><br />I haven't this emotionally invested in a series in a very long time. I saw a ecard on Pinterest that perfectly summed up the way I felt at the end-- It said \\"Struggling to find something that I want to read after finishing 50 Shades\\"<br /><br />Don't despair though! I did indeed pick up another book (and then another, and another) but at first I didn't want to. I needed time to mourn the loss of the people, err, characters that I'd spent the last few days of my life with. Completely engrossed, I might add.
B008CP93S0|4.0|I loved this movie.  I wasn't prepared to, I  adore Wainy Days and anything whereDavid Wain is having fun and being silly.  Unfortunately, many of his recent movies feel like they are taking them self too seriously, like the laughter has been stifled.  But THIS!  This had the same fun, weird, sweet vibe that Wet Hot American Summer had.  Wanderlust turned out to be a refreshing,  goofy, fun time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just as hot as the first, with more drama and emotional depth. And a little more in terms of romance and plotting.<br /><br />This second book has slightly (only slightly, don't fret!) less sex, but what it lacks in the bedroom it more than makes up for in the emotional/ romantic arenas.<br /><br />Also, I'm a little ashamed to admit this, but this darn series is the first one that made me CRY in a good long while. And I don't mean just once. I'm talking multiple tissue-fests. I wasn't expecting that-- when I need a cry I usually read Jodi Picoult or some other reliable heart-string-plucker. And I don't read a lot of genre romance books... maybe that's why this series caught me off guard that way!

B0034JKZ86|5.0|If you don't have blue ray and the coolest-of-the-cool LED 1080 TV to make it work right, this movie is STILL stunningly pretty. I saw it on an ANALOG TV set, definitely NOT the right format for blu-ray. I was STILL extremely impressed with how gorgeous this movie is. I LOVED this movie, I really did. The character is independent, not dependent on some non-existent prince to come and save her, which is beyond stupid, and next to never happens anyhow. She thinks for herself. she knows what she wants. This movie is SO pretty, if you don't have the LED 1080 type TV, I'd say this movie alone would make it worth it. A Samsung 5000 series is very nice, and doesn't really need an expensive sound bar for most applications or most people, with a 32 inch size, and right around 400.00 isn't at all \\"undoable.\\" With my new TV, I have more than enough sound, decent sound quality, and a really impressive picture. I only wish I'd bought a 55 inch screen, but not really practical for a movies-while-cooking kitchen TV set. It's so pretty, I want to just crawl inside it like that old Twlight Zone episode, \\"the 16 millimeter shrine\\" first season, where she wants to crawl into her old movies. If it were that pretty in 1959 it wouldn't have taken her a whole episode to do it.<br /><br />Only a few films are this nice. Cars. nemo. Toy Story. Oh, the Pixar shorts are also gorgeous. LED and the new Blu-ray stuff REALLY makes you want a GINORMOUS TV set and just marvel over great movies like this one. Big enough to need a crane. Bigger than a video screen for Journey in 1980. The HEMI of TV sets. Then sit four inches away and because we're grown, no one will tell us no.

My favorite Pixars are Cars, Nemo and Toy Story. I got a new DVD copy for cheap, and was surprised to like it a lot. I didn't get blu-ray or digital copy for my version. All I'm concerned about is the movie itself. I can imagine blu-ray would be stunning. I'd re-buy it in the BR format but I heard a lot of problems with them so I won't.

0553386794|2.0|Good fantasy story wrapped in a vile presentation filled with frequent rapes and crimes against women, and glorifying violence for the violence-porn addicts out there. Not a book series for anyone who cannot stand rape, and cannot stand buckets-of-blood types of books.  I was given the book as a gift a few years ago for Christmas. The giver didn't know my intense dislike for books that include rape scenes, and crimes against women. I was a good ways into the book before I realized what kind of book it was. By that point, the very interesting story had me hooked enough to try to skip over and ignore the rapes and intense violence. By the end of the book, I had endured casual murder, incest, bestiality (the dragon stuff at the end), women treated like chattel, detailed violence scenes, and torture scenes.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, the story really is interesting, and you will want to know what happens next. George R.R. Martin has tapped into that primal well of human emotions where revenge lives, and has you turning pages to find out what happens next, hoping that soon you will see someone get some justice.  The story of John Snow being an unacknowledged (and hated) bastard in his own household, and how he deals with that, the power struggles, the political intrigue, the family loyalty, the betrayals, all of that is page turner stuff.<br /><br />However, I cannot get over the ultra-violence including the rapes.  I do not find such content entertaining in the least -- I find it horrifying. I now have a strict policy to stop reading any book that has any kind of rape scene. If rape is alluded to \\"off camera\\" and not described, and most certainly NOT glorified, then I will continue reading as long as the author doesn't make a habit of it (especially if the rapists are brought to justice).  I cannot skip over such things any more. It isn't entertainment, it is glorifying one of the worst things a human can do to another human, aside from murder, and I will not support any author doing it.<br /><br />If you are able to look past such things (and I do not fault you for it) and are able to enjoy the fiction as fiction without reading more into it. Then the book will probably be a 4 or 5 star book for you.  For myself, however, it was a 2 star book at best. I am only giving it the extra star, because of the strength of the rest of the story, discounting the rapes and ultra-violence.<br /><br />2 stars.upport any author doing it.<br /><br />If you are able to look past such things (and I do not fault you for it) and are able to enjoy the fiction as fiction without reading more into it.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I play it pretty much on a daily basis and have had no issues. the ads are in betwen card games so not a bother. every now and again one is a video, but if you have wireless turned of, they cant load and cancel out anyways. I also like that it can switch landscape/portrait just with a turn of the tablet.
B004QL7K70|4.0|This like other movies like this have two things in common, nudity and hilarity, put those two together at the right spices, and you will have a recipe for awesomeness. This movie was built to be nothing but action funny lines and vulgarity, and it lived up to its expectations. If you like these types of movies i recommend you get this one, me and my cousin can't stop saying \\"I can't fix any of this\\", hilarious.
B005LAIH54|5.0|When you have three amazing actors - Liam Nesson (Zeus), Ralph Fiennes (Hades) , and new comer Sam Worthington (Perseus) , well it's hard to beat this gem. Yes, the lines might be a bit corny but who cares really, with all the kick but actions scenes! It was not disappointing in the least and worth to add to your movie collection.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|its ok but I don't think its worth a dollar. and it would be better if you could create your own animals.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Playing on the kindle fire. The controls are very intuitive and the games are really easy to master without being stupidly easy. The thing that makes this a 5 star game is the story. I've been playing for hours and it just goes on. Well worth paying for because you get your money's worth. I can't wait to see how the story ends.

B0080OJBQW|5.0|Some artist, such as Nelly Furtado, get producers to sell records, but on the way, these artists lose their own identity as performers. This hasn't happened to Adam, he is being himself a 100% of the time, while collaborating with different producers, I couldn't be more proud of him. He is sooo talented! Congrats for being the 1st gay American artist to hit the # 1 on billboard. Well deserved!!! The future of pop music is here.

B007H9B8FS|4.0|It is good to hear that Garbage is still Garbage. The style and, I think, passion, is still there. Garbage is a band with a very distinctive sound, and not just because of Shirley Manson's vocals. The music, arrangement and production are also hallmarks of their unique sound. I have enjoyed all of their albums and this one does not disappoint.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, another incredible performance by Yanni and his amazing musicians. Most pieces of music are different from other concerts. A joy to watch. Includes a 27 minute backstage documental, showing the preparation and rehearsals for the concert. Working with Yanni means perfection in every way, so he has the best musicians in the worlds. This is shown on each performance. Video is from 2006, so the visual quality and sound is top notch and very clear. Great ambient and mood, and an excellent selection of songs for the DVD. Enjoy
B000005KQT|4.0|Some very nice tracks on this album. I am not a skilled music reviewer but I know what I like, and this is it. The man knows how to blow a harmonica and I love this kind of music. If you know what this is you know you'll love it. If you don't know I suggest you find out. I think you'll be happy you did.
B0050PYNP8|2.0|The preview that I saw of the DVR was extremely misleading as to comedy content. I found the movie to be very boring.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game and ive had it fir a while but I still love it. Which is weird because I usually get tired of games after a while but with all the new goals that this game challenges you with you never get bored with it.
0345803485|1.0|I didn't like the book at all.  The plot was juvenille and the sex was unrealistic.  I like sex and fantasize about everything.  Nothing about their escapades turned me on because she had no control whatsoever.  I don't know.  I think a woman who is that orgasmic would need to take some control early on.  None of it made any sense to me except how much he was enjoying it.  It seemed more like a male fantasy.  Also, the fact that she kept saying he smelled like body wash was a little off too.  I like my guy to smell natural, not like soap.  Everything just seemed too fake for her to be letting go like that.  I think it would have been sexier if the book had her elaborate on the details of what was turning her on - micro details.  It just seemed like cheap porn.
B003ZDNWOA|5.0|Highly entertaining to read and thoughtfully written, even if you don't entirely agree with their opinions.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|Nice game, essentially identical to the Space Game. Easy to play, simple to learn. No, you do not need to spend real money or grind for hours to beat the game.<br /><br />To get those useful upgrades, just play survival on the hardest mode at full speed. Around the 5 minutes mark is when it gets tough, at full speed that's 3 minutes of realize gameplay, and 150 credits. So even if you continuously die at the 5 minutes mark, that's 3000 credits earned in an hour of survival mode play. That'll pretty much get you everything. What you earn playing the campaign will get you anything you have left.<br /><br />Great game, nice option to spend money to buy every upgrade, but again totally not necessary.
0399534601|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter, Sarah. She wrote in it and underlined words and left it a rag tag mess. After she passed away in a car accident when she was 16, I loved flipping through the pages seeing her thoughts and observations.
B005KR6OBM|1.0|Grabbed this from ebay, brand new, for $45 shipping included. I absolutely love this show, my rating is 5/5 for the show. The one star is just to show my irritation at such robbery.
B00000IQW5|5.0|This movie has always been a movie that I keep going back to.  It tugs at your heart strings and keeps you watching every bit of the movie.  The actors are very well know and play their charactors very well.  I would recommend this to any one that wants to watch a romatic movie that includes some drama scenes.
0061808121|5.0|I was very pleased with the condition of this product.  I have always wanted to read this book and was unable to find a version of it without a lot of extra commentary used by teachers.  By having this on CDs, I am reaping the benefits of \\"reading\\" the book.  Sissy Spacek has a wonderful voice that adds to the enjoyment of listening to the book.  I recommend this product for anybody that loves a great story.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It shows how the San Francisco A's got on the winning side of baseball.  I like movies that are actually true events.
B007XF4J70|5.0|Arrived on time with no issues. The movie has so many cool lines that are timeless. The DVD is on my shelf next to other classics.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|This movie continues as a classic... and a cautionary tale. In our current world where we are using medical, genetic and computer technology to race to curing all the world's ills, the question remains; what do you want to die from? If we fix all the disease and death, will we then be asked if we want to renew at age 30? Will we have a perfect disease free life, and then our crystal turns red? This movie was made when sets were cheesy and low budget, however that meant the story had to drive the picture, not the flash. All the CGI in the world can't change the underlying message of logan's run, be careful what you wish for.
0393340244|4.0|I found this book interesting as a further reading in my series on the eternal conundrum of man/woman relationship. This book emphasizes the environmental influence on the development of man and woman, whereas other books looked at the psychological dimension (like \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\") or at the biological evolutionary aspect (like \\"Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps\\") of the differences between genders.<br /><br />Put it another way, what these books purport to be hardware differences, Fine argues are only software differences, the result of education, upbringing, societal influences. Without these external conditioning there is no scientifically measurable difference in the brains of man and woman.<br /><br />In my view the theory developed in this book does not necessarily contradict those of the other, hardware oriented, books. I came away persuaded both are at work and relevant. I also came away persuaded that it does not make a whole lot of difference, for practical purposes: I believe in equal rights between the genders, and so obviously we must strive for equal opportunity. That will probably not result in equal attitudes, equal predispositions, or equal approaches to problem solving. Or maybe, in time, it will. We'll see. For the time being it is clear that the most important thing is to be aware of existing differences, whether hardware or software. Pretending they don't exist can only be harmful to man/woman relationships and counterproductive to our effort to overcome discrimination.
B000GCFO0S|5.0|This move came new and on time the move in all is great and worth watching i understand many silent hill fans dislike it but i though it had a good story, it looked a little grainy at times which i thought odd since it is on blu-ray but nothing to serious. great buy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A great all around weather app.  I especially like the weather radar map, comes in handy to give you that visual reference.
B000069AUI|5.0|Bought this CD a while ago Coldplay has always been one of my favorites so i decided to tell you that the CD came on time and in great condition i was happy .
B005LAIH5O|5.0|i was waiting for this movie to come out on blue ray. i seen it in theaters and loved it. and when i pre ordered it i knew it would be a little bit to recieve it. i want to thank the shipper for shipping it asap.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|game is fun and I like it would recommend for anyone to play.  really enjoy and the movie feature is funny.
B004IK30S2|5.0|thank u for an excellent product. i received this movie earlier than planned. i would definitly order again from this dealer.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|it has done it again! on kindle fire drawsome isn't awesome!  I have had to uninstall and reinstall twice.  don't think I will try again.  it's not worth the effort.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great app,  you really never have to get another game again. The games a challenging but simple and very fun!!:)
1469984202|5.0|It's been a while since I read a good scifi book.  This is not your typical shoot-em scifi it is more along the lines of Dune.  I would highly recommend this series.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|very nice watch, really cheap and do all that promises. the box is really nice and well built, the watch is a little bit heavy but thats ok, for that price is a great option.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|A novel is not necessarily a good story.  This is surely not an \\"and then...and then...\\"work.  It would not make it as a soap opera or another \\"Shade of Gray\\" book.  This purports to be literature, which is to say, a commentary on life.  It is an old man looking back on events of a few weeks as a 15 year old.  Mr Ford would not make a welcome guest on Doctor Phil or Oprah (is that still on?)<br /><br />Here are a few lines as examples of the writing: \\"...might have forgotten even that I was there--like a hammer left in a photograph, present only to provide scale, a point of reference, and that exhausts its value once the picture's taken.\\"<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"'I don't see what this has to do with us.' I say back, 'Does everything have to be about you? Can you not project yourself outside yourself?  Can you not take on another's life for your own benefit?'\\"<br /><br />Mr Ford requires the reader to look back and to look inward and to reflect.<br /><br />Lastly, there are no \\"juicy\\" parts of the book.
0545128285|3.0|Cute, good cause, but not nearly as entertaining as her other books. Worth the read for the other crazy Harry Potter fans out there, but if you're not SUPER into Harry you should probably pass on this one.
B000N2HCM4|3.0|A literary \\"Tour de Force\\"  in the genre. Standing shoulder to shoulder with such masterpieces as Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Harry Potter and the works of the Grimm Brothers.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is so addicting I plow thru the updates.  when is the next one coming please?! really need my om num fix.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Okay, I know this has a variety of reviews stars for a lot of reasons. I've bought this movie too many times to count now. I have several copies on VHS, and DVD in both the new version and the orginal release. It's crazy, but I still bought myself a copy of the Blue Ray version and it was worth it.<br /><br />Why? Because the improved video and audio is worth it.<br /><br />This is a timeless class and children and adults of all ages enjoy it from every generation. So I love sharing it with my family and this is the version I share. :)<br /><br />I am a woman, and I'm not an over the top fan. I don't attend the comic conventions or dress up in costume, but I love this series and it will always have a treasured spot on my video collection shelf.
1883398088|4.0|If you are an Alien fan, this book should be in your collection!  It has awesome pictures from the movies and from behind the scenes (which is SUCH a bonus!).  Giger was an artist even before his \\"Alien\\" creation caught on, so he is a stickler for details.  This is the definitive \\"Alien\\" book!  I could barely wait until my son's birthday to give it to him so that we could BOTH read it and look at the pictures!  It was WORTH waiting for!
0061119776|5.0|A classic book for kids. I had a program at work where we read this book to the children before their bedtime. I needed multiple copies.
0425238091|5.0|the book is a good read, very funny ,and a book i didnt want to put down,a small amount of the medical world knowledge would be helfull but not a nesessatie,its a book i could read again and still find funny .
0345803485|4.0|I wanted to know what the deal was with this sensational book.  So far....to be honest...eh...but thank you for offering the book at a great price and it shipped quickly.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is so fun I even got it on my computer I even find myself playing it in he middle of the night
B004GF244K|4.0|Great collectors piece, wonderful cross section of artists playing a tribute to George Harrison. Very good concert, well worth taking in the nostalgia and listening to some music that is no longer played commercially
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is by far one of the best documentary movies ever made!  My son first purchased it for me as a gift for $70 and since them I've purchased 3 copies for family and friends for $20. It is by far one of the best and if you have a flat-screen tv it is a must.  Even my 6 month old grandson loves to watch it with me as the colors and visual aspects are outstanding.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|After reading a few of the most recent best sellers i was aprehensive to read this book.  The first few chapters almost made me put down the book but after a while i fell in love with the characters and their flaws. Unlike some other books out there no one is a billionare and they dont fall in love in chapter 3. It almost takes 1/2 the book for them to physically get together and when they finally do they are  crazy disfunctional but they never give upon each other.I read it quickly because i became consumed with this story and i just wanted them to figure out how to make it work.

B005UG542S|4.0|Well, it finally ends.  Harry finally meets his shadow self, I mean Voldemort, having cleaned out his major chakra blockages, I mean soul fragments, I mean horcruxes, and a host of negative thoughts, I mean deatheaters, is dispelled.  This movie is pretty well made.  It doesn't have all the detail of the books unfortunately.  It is state of the art for what it is.  [[ASIN:B00003CXCQ Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Disney Special Platinum Edition)]] was state of the art for its day, and it was also metaphysical, with a villain who self-destructed.  Both reflect the time they were made in.  I liked the movie.  I have heard people complain that it is \\"occult\\", and too dark.  Well, sometimes life is dark.  The Narnia books also have magic, and darkness.  I liked this movie, given the limitations of going from book to film, this was done very well.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game.  I can sit and relax and try to build up my village. Keep the great games coming!
0470474874|4.0|Straightforward, to the point, it covers many topics.  The only real way to learn Excel is to use it, and then ask the right questions, with a book like this handy.
0451196716|5.0|If you love Stephen King you will enjoy this book.  It was very similar to the \\"Hunger Games\\" in as much as the world in it's current altered state has towns sponsor a walk of young boys in which if participants  slow down, faint, get sick, or any number of other issues that interferes with their walking before they get to the finish line they are shot dead.  I am always ambivilent about King's books but have come to love them.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I read the comic books when I was a kid, so of course I had to see the movie.  It was great!  Other reviewers say more than I can.  This is absolutely perfect, for the teenager still inside me, who comes out to play occasionally.  This is as good as the [[ASIN:B0043KURU6 Peter Brook's The Mahabharata]] for me.
B007OXWWX4|4.0|It's a great time to be a Slash fan.<br /><br />The iconic guitarist has been working non-stop ever since he re-emerged as a solo artist, and his new album is his most satisfying effort in years. With APOCALYPTIC LOVE, Slash has delivered an album that his fans will truly enjoy.<br /><br />Two years ago, he released his first solo record - SLASH - featuring an all-star roster of guest vocalists; He embarked on a mammoth world tour with a great band featuring frontman and SLASH contributor Myles Kennedy; Last year's MADE IN STOKE 24/7/11 live album and DVD, captured the show that got rave reviews from fans on every corner of the globe.<br /><br />Now the band - \\"Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators\\" - have released their first studio album together, and what a band!<br /><br />With Myles Kennedy, Slash has finally found his muse again. Drummer Brent Fitz propels the songs over-the-top, into head-banging, fist-thumping territory.<br /><br />This new Slash album should give his loyal fans reason to celebrate. A bunch of great new rock songs full of killer riffs and classic solos!<br /><br />Slash plans to do another solo record following this one. He says he wrote APOCALYPTIC LOVE entirely on the last tour, and that's how he's going to write the next album!
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|This is a Hollywood version of Vietnam.  There is plenty of violence, not recommended for children.  It is also not realistic; training units do not have ready access to weapons, as this implies, as one example.  Also, snipers are not neutralized so easily as the final scenes imply, either.  The Drill Instructor- DI- is well played.  It is depressing, really.  Corporal punishment no longer happens, in fact basic training/boot camp is a lot softer than it used to be.  In a way, this is Kubrick's version of All Quiet on the Western Front, about the futility of war.  I don't disagree with that point, but Kubrick is usually a lot more careful with detail.  This movie is like Kubrick's other movies; a set art piece, worth seeing.  I found it somewhat depressing, myself, but then again, war is depressing.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love the game and to the person who's child bought a bunch of stuff:  go into Parental Controls on your Kindle and there is an option to turn off in-game purchases.  And to end the game, click on the blue options wheel in the lower left corner and then click on &quot;stuff&quot; and you'll see a little exit door and that will get you back home. Enjoy!
B0012QVJXS|5.0|Superman is as much a symbol of America as Uncle Sam.  He's also a Sun God- gets his power from the Sun, has a Hebrew Angel's name- ending in -el, as with Gabriel, or Raphael.  The movie is set up well, and may have been state of the art for its day.  This is a great movie, well worth watching, kids would enjoy it.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|High Voltage is AC/DC's first international album and the songs on it are a compilation of their best songs from their first two albums: the Australian version of High Voltage and TNT. I'm a huge fan of the Bon Scott years, which I prefer over the Brian Johnson years, and in my opinion, this is AC/DC's best album. Can I Sit Next To You Girl, Little Lover, and The Jack alone make the album a must-have for any AC/DC fan. I love this album a lot and I listen to it all the time whether I'm working out, going out for a walk, or just relaxing. I borrowed this album from a friend so I could put the songs onto my iPod and I loved the album so much that I bought my own copy of the CD and got it in the mail in just 3 days. If you're just getting into AC/DC or you're an old fan, buy this album because you will definitely not regret it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was not sure that I was going to like this book or that it would hold my interest.After hearing from my nieces and seeing that they could not put it down I decided to download it on to my kindle and I am so glad I did it is a great book. On to book two.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I agree with those who say Flynn threw everything but the kitchen sink into this first novel. It is hard to imagine a dysfunction she did not cover here, but I have ordered her next two books.
B007IX383I|5.0|I never got into the whole \\"doom-death\\" thing. My few \\"extreme metal\\" bands had to go well above the norm for me to totally get into them (opeth, in the woods, agalloch, as points of reference). What Anathema have evolved into has as much root in extreme metal as the wu tang clan does with mozart. But what they've become is the purest sentiment of what doom-death strived to be. Powerful yet restrained. Despondent yet hopeful. Emotianaly stirring. Its darn near impossible to top WHBWH, with Energy being one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard, but I can honestly say that SOMEHOW Anathema keep perfecting a formula that we can't possibly think can get any better. If you like the music of Alcest, the potential of new Katatonia, the lyrics of Tool, soaring harmonies, impeccable production, and perfectly done vocals, do yourself a favor and check this out.

It's a shame that this has turned into a best seller, the writing is at the level of a 4th grader and the characters are as shallow as they can be. Not even at the level of providing mindless entertainment. Will think twice before I pick up another bestseller.

B000002TYX|5.0|The Beatles from their beginnings to around the \\"Hard Day's Night\\" period.  It is great to hear some of their early, rare recordings.  Their musical skills are evident from the start and this collection demonstrates their growth as song writers.  That \\"skiffle\\" beat is nearly always present, if you listen closely, and what makes the music so infectious.  \\"Free As A Bird\\" is the first song in the Anthology set and a powerful way of opening the series.

George had many excellent songs during the Beatle years that didn't get recorded and/or released with the group. His first solo album was a collection of many of those songs.  I would rank this album as one of the top 20 recordings of all time.

B005LCECU6|5.0|RUSH ABC 1974 took me back to my roots.  This is the band I grew up loving and this recording brought back the original sound from those very early days when RUSH first became a professional group and was developing their sound and identity.  I remember fondly listening to RUSH before every hockey game in the locker room getting ready to rock our opponent the way RUSH rocked me.

B007Y57OD0|3.0|The music on Banks of Eden (2012) consists of the same approach presented on their 1995 debut, which in turn, was merely a re-tread of the late 1970s-early 1980s stadium rock acts, along with American progressive groups like Starcastle.  The overall sound blends the harder edged sound of riff-heavy stadium rock with neo-progressive rock and perhaps a smidge of the soft adult contemporary rock style.<br /><br />Overall, the highlight of the album for me was the keyboard playing (Tomas Bodin) - he is just fantastic and I love his use of tone color (some of the synthesizer tones were generated with software). The players are all solid though and the new drummer (Felix Lehrman) sounds just like previous drummers; particularly Zoltan Csorz (an excellent percussionist by the way).  At times though, the new drummer reminds me of a very young Ian Paice (Deep Purple) circa 1970-1972.  The vocals and lyrics suffer from the same problems as on earlier albums - my wish is that they would either go instrumental or hire a singer/lyricist.<br /><br />Pop melodies abound and it is clear they spent a lot of time putting each track together. As featured on any number of their albums, Banks of Eden opens with a long track that consists of several unrelated bits and pieces tacked together.  The remaining tracks are not bad and are somewhat short (5-8 minutes).  My favorite of the \\"shorter\\" tracks is For the Love of Gold - this is a waltzy tune that was co-authored by Tomas Bodin and the guitarist (Roine Stolt).  The closing track Rising the Imperial, which was written by the bassist (Jonas Reingold), is an overly calculated and maudlin ballad that boasts Roine doing his best interpretation of the guitar solo on Comfortably Numb (Pink Floyd, The Wall, 1979).  This was my least favorite track.  Come to think of it, the main theme from this track is presented during a few points during the track Numbers.  Typically, restating central themes serves to draw connecting threads between different pieces.  I am not quite sure what the objective here was though - there is no relationship between any of the individual pieces.<br /><br />I was able to get the deluxe, 2-CD edition of the album fairly cheaply.  Total running time is somewhere around 53 minutes - I am still used to the running length of vinyl records so this was a perfect length.  The overall package is very nice and features some cool cover art and a booklet that has the lyrics and color photos of the group in the studio.  The sound quality is outstanding - very little compression was applied and the music sounds natural.  The bonus tracks on disc 2 (running time around 20 minutes) are OK -they sound like studio outtakes.  There is also a roughly 20-minute long video of the group being interviewed in the studio.<br /><br />All in all, this album will likely appeal to fans of the group.  It just did not push all of my buttons because I find their emphasis on stale stadium rock cliches and a reluctance to embrace musical ideas outside of mainstream rock frustrating - this seems to go against the very spirit of progressive music.  What is most frustrating, however, is that these guys seem content to just play it safe.  Progressive was never safe - it challenged the listener, it shattered the norm, and above all else, it was exciting.ent pieces.

0618001905|5.0|Adventure tales by intrepid explorers, the maniacal greed and cruelty of a despotic monarch, and the tireless work of a small group of people to uncover the truth: this book describes the cast of characters and the story of Belgium's colony in the Congo.<br /><br />What started as a quest for resources (specifically ivory and rubber) and an expansion beyond the borders of a small European country turned into a holocaust of epic proportions. There are harrowing and graphic scenes of cruelty and torture described (I had to set the book aside more than once - very disturbing), but also some of hope, seeing the birth of some of the human rights advocacy groups that we see today.<br /><br />The last chapter was the crowning achievement - I really liked how Hochschild wrapped the book up by talking about memory and records. Leopold went to such great lengths to destroy all of the official records - literally burning the State Archives - but he could not take away the memories and oral histories. These stories live on - most notably in Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness* that features characters based on real people and events witnessed in the Congo, and in meticulous research like Hochschild's.<br /><br />It is a book that was hard to read, but I am so glad I did. Highly recommended.

1609611543|4.0|I have long suspected that wheat did not like me as much as I liked it - so, I decided to kick it to the curb for an experiment. This book was the first one I found in my search to back up my assertions, and I learned a lot from it.<br /><br />Davis is a cardiologist, and the book is filled with stories of patients who gave up wheat under his guidance and have seen complete 180s in their health: people who couldn't walk because of severe arthritis, others who were extremely obese and depressed, and those who had unexplained aches, allergies, and ailments. The book is not just for celiacs or gluten intolerant individuals - he states clearly that everyone can benefit from getting rid of this grain, which is not what it used to be even a hundred years ago.<br /><br />In several pointed chapters, Davis lays it out about wheat's effect on the brain, the body's pH balance, the skin and aging, and links to obesity and a number of other chronic ailments, chief among them diabetes and arthritis. Some of the most convincing and telling arguments he makes for getting rid of wheat are the blood sugar tests: how two slices of whole grain bread can spike blood sugars more than regular old sugar.<br /><br />My one criticism of the book is how Davis shows harmful correlations (most notably that of meat consumption in the body in terms of pH balance) yet, advocates meat and dairy as \\"EAT IN ALL QUANTITIES\\" in his food plan. Why spend a whole chapter talking about pH balance in the body, and *THEN* advocate meat consumption? You just said that meat was acidic, and our bodies want neutral/slightly alkaline - just eating MORE leafy greens isn't enough to cancel out the acid of meat consumption. I found that information inconsistent with everything else he was trying to prove. I eat a strict plant-based diet so I have strong ethical feelings about this, but that aside, he doesn't make a case WHY meat should even be included in this plan at all.<br /><br />In many ways this book seems to be a \\"repackaging\\" of the popular and ubiquitous PALEO food plan - just in a lighter and more palpable format. He doesn't say to get rid of rice and beans, for instance, but says to limit their consumption. Agriculture is not painted as the \\"fall of civilization\\" here.<br /><br />The book isn't perfect, but it has some good tidbits, and I'm a sucker for testimonials.be a \\"repackaging\\" of the popular and ubiquitous PALEO food plan - just in a lighter and more palpable format.

B0079HLDCQ|5.0|A fast action packed book with an intriguing story line that makes this book exciting from the get go. With more twists than a good bike road,you won't want to put it down, even when you get to this last page. Books this good should last a lot longer.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The Hunger Games is, at its core, an engaging and interesting story about a dystopic society set years after a catastrophe changed the government and people of our world. In this society, children are killed off annually in a televised gameshow meant to intimidate the general populace and keep them in line. This is a compelling tale that is difficult to put down. That said, I hated the main character, Katniss, more than I have ever before hated a main character. Despite having a few good qualities, such as her independence and intelligence, the first person point of view allows the reader to truly get to know her other characteristics. Katniss exemplifies all of the qualities I hate most about some girls. She is completely self-centered, ignorant of how others feel around her, impulsive, almost always angry, manipulative, and something of a bully. There were times when I was reading that I had to put down the book, grit my teeth, and let my annoyance and anger at her thoughts and actions pass. Though I hated her, that the writing was capable of affecting me in this manner shows that her character was well-developed and realistic of a certain kind of girl. Why anyone would want to write about such a person, though, is beyond me. Even her love interests eventually figured out what kind of a person she was and confronted her, but she never knew what to say. This did show that the author came to see her character in a similar way, which I was glad to see. Out of the three books, I enjoyed the third one the most, perhaps because more focus was placed on the political situation than Katniss' problems figuring out which boy she likes best. There were some issues with editing that could have been better. Many sentences were fragments, causing the books to read rather choppily. I could understand doing this for emphasis in certain situations, but the continuous use of fragments as a style of writing caused me annoyance from time to time. In the more fast paced sections, thiscan be overlooked more easily. Overall, I enjoyed the story and concept behind it, but I could not stand Katniss.

0553801473|4.0|Dear George R. R. Martin<br /><br />I've recently finished \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" and, like the previous books in the series, I loved it - gritty, devious, heroic, fantastical, compelling, page-turning, crude, sexy... you get the gist. No one does fantasy quite like you, that's for sure. It was also nice to have Tyrion back in the story, as well as Jon, Daenerys and the little updates on Bran (who I'm most curious about), as well as a host of other great characters. A sign of a truly great fantasy is missing the characters after you finish the book and I miss them dearly. This is why I wanted to write to you.<br /><br />WHEN is the next book coming out?<br /><br />When you finished \\"A Feast for Crows\\" in 2005, you promised we'd get our fix of the rest of the characters next year - which I took to be 2006. Well here we are in 2012 and I've just read it. Now I appreciate it was published in 2011, but I actually waited until the soft copy came out, because I'd waited so long already, why rush out to purchase the hard cover version, which is physically painful to read? When I read hard cover books, it hurts my wrists holding the big tomes open, as well as my body as the sharp corners poke into my skin if reading in bed. Now you are an author of a calibre that I always buy in hard cover - pain and all - but not for this one... maybe for the next? Depends on when you publish it I suppose.<br /><br />Understand I am not being critical, because I appreciate you have been a very busy man creating HBO's \\"Game of Thrones\\" and well done on that. Not only have you given me an interpretation of the story different to my own imagination - and luckily I like your interpretation - but you have made fantasy appealing to a much broader demographic than before. This is a wonderful thing for readers of fantasy, and I'm hoping it will create new fantasy writing talent for all of us to enjoy.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of your work and you are definitely one of my favourite fantasy writers. But please, all I ask is don't take too long to publish the next book? I don't want to forget the story by the time it comes out - as I did with the last one. I actually re-read \\"A Feast for Crows\\" to remind myself of the story, but I forgot the story before that too... One day I'll have to read them all again.<br /><br />In closing off, I felt compelled to ask you, on behalf of your adoring fans who have been with you since the beginning, please get that next bloody book out ASAP OK? Have we got a deal?<br /><br />Keep up the amazing work.<br /><br />PS: I get why some of the reviews have been less than satisfied. However I think we're at a critical point in the story, where all of the characters stories need to come together, and that is what makes me excited about the next book. I can't wait!s.

B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|Linkin Park's last couple of albums have been somewhat `scattered.'  Sure 2007's [[ASIN:B000OCXMAE Minutes to Midnight]] had solid cuts in \\"Given Up\\"  and \\"Shadow of the Day\\"  while 2010's [[ASIN:B003V9J6QQ A Thousand Suns]] similarly had \\"The Catalyst.\\"  Despite the bright spots and the aid of Rick Rubin, the albums both had plenty of flaws.  Apparently, `third time'  may really be `charm' on 2012's [[ASIN:B007UQ5Z1G LIVING THINGS]], which is easily the best of this recent trio of Linkin Park albums.  Rick Rubin returns as producer, and for whatever reason, Living Things feels more cohesive than previous releases.  It's not perfect, but at just under thirty-seven minutes, there truly is little to complain about given the tightness and brevity.<br /><br />\\"Lost in the Echo\\" opens the effort capably with synth and pummeling drum programming; the sound is epic here.  Shinoda takes the reigns by rapping verses with Bennington anchoring the refrain: \\"And these promises broken/deep, feeble/each word gets lost in the echo/so one last lie I can see through/this time I finally let you/Go, go, go...\\" The sound is appealing, Shinoda's rhymes strong, making \\"Lost in the Echo\\" a superb opener.  \\"In My Remains\\" cedes no momentum, opening with typical Linkin Park synths and dusty, pounding drums.  The driving sound is superb once guitars enter in at full fruition.  This go-round Chester Bennington takes the lead, as capably as he did years ago.  The bridge is a selling point here, particularly the lyrics \\"Like an army, falling, one by one.\\" At just over three minutes in duration, this is a well packaged cut.<br /><br />\\"Burn It Down,\\" the strong first single, finds Linkin Park honing in on their signature sound. Bennington's lead vocals are clear, with superb vocal production.  The refrain is catchy and filled with angst, even if Bennington `tames the beast': \\"We're building it up/to break it back down/we're building it up/to burn it down, we can't wait to burn it to the ground...\\" Shinoda raps following the second refrain/verse while Bennington incorporates a short bridge proceeding Shinoda. \\"Burn it Down\\" marks three solid cuts for Linkin Park, something that may not be necessarily pertinent to its previous two albums.<br /><br />\\"Lies Greed Misery\\" is less successful than the `big three,' but certainly ambitious if less accessible.  The production work is intense, accompanying Shinoda's rapping.  More manic than the openers, this cut is a bit harder to decipher.  Where listeners have been waiting for Bennington's angst-driven vocals, they come full-fledged here.  Wouldn't be a Linkin Park album if Bennington didn't scream right? \\"I'll Be Gone\\" finds Bennington singing more tamely and patterns itself similar to the album's initial cuts.  It doesn't possess the same flare per say, but most will find it more `traditional' than \\"Lies Greed Misery.\\"<br /><br />\\"Castle of Grass\\" takes :36 to build up, but the results are enjoyable during the `percolation' period. The verse is nothing too crazy with some sense of the static, though not in a boring sense.  The initial refrain begins restrained before the dynamics increase.  Because there is a sense of restraint, it actually makes the listener tune in more and proves ultimately rewarding. Yeah, it lacks the `overt' sound fans have come to know the band for, but \\"Castles of Grass\\" is something special if you give it a chance.  \\"Victimized,\\" one of those ever popular interludes, opens with mysterious synthetic effects.  Predictably (knowing Linkin Park's formula respectfully), hard drums and wailing guitars enter in.  Once the vocal enter, they are drenched in effects before Bennington screams histrionically \\"Victimized! Victimized!\\" Shinoda begins to rap against the angular production, leaving the listener to describe this cut as puzzling, interesting, and well manic.<br /><br />\\"Roads Untravelled\\" finds the band exercise time to setup and establish the cut.  The harmonic progression is a highlight here, as is the use of organ.  Overall, the sound is alluring and \\"Roads Untravelled\\" yields some sound musical moments.  \\"Roads\\" may not top \\"Burn It Down\\" necessarily, but it is one of the standouts.<br /><br />The remainder of the album sort of descends into that `murky' hole that sometimes affects the entirety of Linkin Parks albums (this was a problem with their previous two albums).  Here, the cuts aren't so bad and there have been more than enough highlights to anchor this release.  \\"Skin to Bone\\" features captivating production work, notably a looping synth, but feels a bit underdeveloped perhaps.  \\"Until It Breaks\\" falls into the boat of \\"Lies Greed Misery\\" in the sense that it is a bit `all of the place.' Shinoda's raps are masked in vocal effects with incredibly busy and loud supporting production.  Bennington, predictably, comes in an contrasts the heaviness surrounding Shinoda. Overall, the cut is ambitious, though a bit `heady' and could stand for more songwriting `shaping' and `cues' to make it more polished.<br /><br />\\"Tinfoil,\\" clocking in at just over 1:00 segues from \\"Until It Breaks\\" and gives the listeners an instrumental interlude.  The soundscape is very nice.  \\"Powerless,\\" the solid  closer, segues from \\"Tinfoil.\\" It's not as good as the openers, but is in the league of \\"Roads Untravelled.\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007UQ5Z1G LIVING THINGS]] is the first Linkin Park album in recent times as a reviewer where there are more positives than negatives.  The balance is better established here between experimentation, angst, and solid songwriting.  The production remains top-notch only becoming overwrought occasionally.

B007V508CC|3.0|Dear Maroon 5,<br />First of all, I want to say that I love you more than I have ever loved any band.  Your songs have been the soundtrack in my head for the last 10 years, and I must say that I find your music brilliant.  I would describe it as rock with funk infused jazz.  Each song has so many levels and evokes and indescribable feeling of joy, energy and most of all sexiness.  In my darkest moments I could put on any one of your CD's and my life returns to normal as I swirl and dance around the room, or just belt it out in my car.  When I first heard Payphone, I was like \\"yes, lets count the minutes and seconds till Overexposed comes out\\"  I was at Target when it opened and couldn't get the wrapping off quick enough to play on the ride home in the car.  Maroon 5, my disappointment CANNOT  be described as I listenend to this CD.  Yes, there are some catchy tunes, and yes it certainly is listenable, but where are the catchy lyrics, the amazing sounds of jazz and sophistication.  Where oh where did you guys go????  Are you breaking up with me?  Is it not working out for us????  Different does not mean that something cannot be terrific, but this CD is just OK.  Will I listen to it??? Yes... will I love it?  No.... will I feel the same joy as the other CD's?  No.  Please come back to me, please make things like they used to be, when everything was so good for us.  Here is hoping that your foray into techno pop was just temporary insanity, and what made you Maroon 5 comes back real soon, so that we can be together again.  Love, Your Biggest Fan.

I've read every Reacher novel and they are all great...some better than others, but none are \\"bad.\\"  This one is no exception ... the story is cleverly constructed, there are enough twists and turns to make the outcome unpredictable, and Child's writing is always well-paced and excellent.  And you have to love Jack Reacher!

0062060562|1.0|Sorry, this book didn't work for me.  the story line is clever, but the writing is very simplistic and tiring.  It takes too long for anything to happen and it generally is boring.  I put it down half way through the book, which is something I never do.

0345803485|1.0|This has got to have been written by a 7th grader with a LOT of imagination!  I was embarassed to be reading this NOT because of the explicit sexual content but because of the horrible writing. Please don't waste your money on this.  I unfortunately ordered all three before I started the first one and have since been angry that I even dared contribute to the sales of this junk.  The dialogue was so juvenile and banal it was astonishing to me that it was accepted for publishing.  I will probably trash all three rather than donate and subject anyone else to such garbage.  Like I said, please don't get me wrong, it's not the explicit sexual content that bothered me, it is the worse than poor writing.

030758836X|2.0|I was told I HAD to read this book. It's hype is overwhelming.<br />It started out interestingly.  Then downhill big time.<br />The writing is surprisingly pedestrian. The plot , as said, starts out strong. The last 2/3 of the book were increasingly preposterous. I found it  contrived, slick and disappointing.<br />I guess most readers like this. It's been hugely successful. I guess I like well written and believable books, which this was not.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|i had to give it a three the name says plus i see nothing plus about it.  besides thlarg #'s.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this game..  kinda mindless time-killing fun.  great while waiting on something to cook or waiting in a station or terminal...  or on a ride or flight.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just finished this marvellous series and I can only say I am completely blown away by just how well Hugh Howey writes. Great concept, detailed characters, twists and turns in the plot that really surprise but never seem outlandish...all adds up to a book that I just couldn't stop reading. Loved it. Highly recommended
B007MG360G|2.0|I really wanted to like this game.  I thought Doodle God was excellent, but the app had bugs that frequently caused it to crash.  Doodle Farm does not contain any bugs, but the intuitiveness of Doodle God is gone.  Most of the combinations seem totally arbitrary, making Doodle Farm more of a game of trial and error than logic.  Furthermore, the game will not last very long, and gives you little reason to go back.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. it is very fun and every game is different and changes it up! must have app
B007IXWKUK|1.0|After the sort of surprise ending of the first book, I was glad that Anastasia finally grew some cojones and stood up to Christian. And what could have made for excellent tension between the two, on whether or not they would get back together and their journey to get there, was pretty much immediately solved. After spending an eternity apart, oh wait, did I say eternity? I meant a week, they just can't stand it anymore and they are back together. Oh, and this happens within the first fifty pages or so.<br /><br />So what's the rest of this book about you ask?<br /><br />Not a whole lot. There is surprisingly some semblance of a plot, but when you find out what it is, it's just plain stupid, and really an afterthought.<br /><br />It got pretty redundant. It's much of the same thing as the first one, sex, petty drama, more boning, Christian is even more beautiful than before, more sex, he's even more controlling, more boning,  his stalker tendencies that only got creepier, Anastasia rolls over even more, Christian's eyes are greyer than ever, more terrible email format writing, and we find out he's better/ can do even more things perfectly. Oh, and also, more boning. The constant boning got pretty stale and was pretty much the same every time, ALL the time. Jealousy seemed to be the only drama that came up, again, and again, and again. Even I got tired of hearing about Elena, aka Mrs. Robinson. Although, I am glad that her inner goddess decided to spruce the place up by getting a chaise lounge.<br /><br />While I was struggling through this god awful excuse for a book, I realized what got so many women hot and bothered: This book is as much word porn as it is actual sex. Throw in a boatload of money and you have every woman's dream apparently. Christian says some nice things, what every woman likes to hear, though it's hard to believe he has issues when he's this free with his feelings. The fact that these two have only known each other for, what, two months maybe, and already they are confessing their undying love for one another is gag-worthy more than swoon-worthy. There is a marriage proposal, but mainly for the reason that Christian wants to make her his and so she can't leave him again. How dreamy. Ugh...<br /><br />Boring, this book was sooooo boring! If it wasn't for my friend's prodding, I would not even touch the third book. I can pretty much tell the end to this series already, and will have to slog through even more terribleness to get there...
B00881VLCE|4.0|There is a nice selection of puzzels. Just wish they offered a better free selection or more. Like the fact that I can advance with the number of pieces so I can play or my children can play.
0345803507|5.0|At the beginning when I heard about the book and the hype that it had, I did not consider buying it.  I had never read books that go this deep into sex. I finally gave in and went ahead and bought the first book and read it in two days. I had to buy the next two right away to continue the story. Could not put these books down!<br /><br />Some people put so much emphasis on how the book is written, that is not proper English, that they repeat too much, and so on and so on and become so critical of books like these.  Myself, I prefer easy reading that does not put me to sleep and that sparks my curiosity to keep on reading even if I have to skip sleeping. I just enjoy the book and not care about all the imperfections that some people have to point out and ruin it for others. To me the trilogy DOES have a story to it with a very happy ending. If you don't like repetition of phrases, then don't bother to buy them. This didn't bother me at all. The sex might be repetitious too, but if it had been deeper then it would have been just xrated porn. If you are into that, then these books will probably bore you also, so don't buy them.<br /><br />Everyone I know that has read these books have loved them. If you are like me and just enjoy reading and curious about the hype, you will like the trilogy. So go for it!
0345803485|2.0|I am not claiming to be a grammatical whiz but I am shocked that this book's editor let it get published with all of these writing errors. The incomplete thoughts drove me crazy!!! I am a quick reader and it took me 10 days to get through the first 100 pages.  That's how long it usually takes me to read 3 full books. I had to keep putting it down because it was so frustrating to read.  The storyline improves a little and you can get through the book easier as time goes on.  I'm just not impressed at all.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|We bought this when our son was around 4 months old and we were STILL trying to find a paci he liked.  He was losing his paci in the middle of the night and would wake up because of this.  We found the wubbanub and it was an easy fix.  Definitely worth the money.  Around 6 months he stopped using it as he didn't use a paci at night any longer but now at 10 months he likes to sleep on his side and uses his wubbanub again to hold on to and use the paci on it.
6304602944|5.0|Tango and Cash is a cool movie. Some of their lines are funny. So it's not just an action movie. I've never seen this movie till tonight when hubby and I watched it during dinner.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|I can live without Captain America and Thor -- even in the comics they were never my favorite superheroes, which is why I never followed The Avengers -- but I'm a sucker for Iron Man, particularly as inhabited by Robert Downey Jr., an absolute cinematic treasure. The movie is worth watching just for Downey's snarky performance. Some of the other actors seem like tree trunks compared to the effortless vibrancy that Downey brings to his role.<br /><br />The action scenes are plentiful and well-constructed, the special effects are special, but what I really like about The Avengers is the script. The decision to have superheroes sniping at each other until they had a reason to come together was inspired. Joss Whedon's dialog is snappy, smart, funny, and occasionally inspiring. Okay, what I also like is the chance to look at Scarlett Johansson and Gwyneth Paltrow, but their sensuality is sadly downplayed in favor of high-tech gear and explosions. Still, watching the Hulk pummel Loki almost makes up for the waste of two wonderful actresses.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Did this deliver my summer afternoon&#34;dorito&#34; fix? Yes. Is it plausible? No. Was the author trying to make some statement about dysfunctional relationships? Who knows. But the ending felt rushed & out of sync with the overall story.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I gave up on this movie one hour in, when all I could discern was that<br />there was a \\"mole\\" in the British spy service. I don't think that's<br />really a spoiler since the subject of the film and novel is well known.<br />However, when that is the only clear plot detail to emerge in an hour's<br />time, you know the movie is a complete disaster.<br /><br />Regardless of the who's who of British acting talent in the film, none<br />of them under the misguided director's influence can save the<br />experience from being dull, boring, confusing, and in the end,<br />annoying.<br /><br />Who are these characters; after an hour you still don't really know.<br />Why are they all so depressing? You don't care because you really don't<br />know them.<br /><br />This may be one of the SLOWEST paced movies in cinema history. The<br />actors mumble lines in a host of British accents; the musical score is<br />slow; there is a lot of space between speeches; lots of deadpan<br />staring; the director's art house cutting takes us all over the place<br />without helping us to know where we are; flashbacks come and go but<br />your not sure they are flashbacks. This is only part of the frustration<br />of suffering through the first hour of the film. You keep on waiting<br />and hoping for something INTERESTING to happen. You get nowhere!<br /><br />No one seems to have bothered, and I am talking specifically about the<br />director and screenwriter, to tell the story in this movie to keep the<br />viewer interested; a damning and hideous flaw.<br /><br />I decided to see the movie based on many of the positive reviews in the<br />press. Well, I admit, to all, I gave up after 1 hour. I have no desire<br />to return and see if things improved after that; doubtful, since the<br />film is so consistently lifeless. Life is really too short to waste a<br />minute of your time on this tedious exercise in obtuse anti-narrative.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is a great read for anyone interest in World War II and our Marines in the Pacific.  It told of the gritty everyday fear and the deprevation of such war fighting.  It tells of the fear and the hate for the enemy on both sides of the conflict.  It is a terrible way to solve a one nations problem with another. It is very well written and is extremely interesting.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book to see what all the hype was about and only ended up disappointed for wasting my time and money on simple smut.
B004QL7K6G|4.0|I can't imagine any newborn baby feeling grateful or appreciative for having parts of themselves (placenta, umbilical cord, etc) removed from them moments after being born - especially when the \\"pulsating\\" cord was still delivering nutrients and oxygen to them.  Does this produce a level of stress leading to a release of an excess amount of adrenaline?  Could delayed cord severing or waiting for the cord to fall off on its on time (2 - 5 days) help the child to feel more connected/grounded in life?  Navel-gazing on the navel.  I think this movie deserves credit for giving viewers a rare look at how natural child birthing is done where the cord is allowed to drop off on its own accord (\\"A Lotus Birth\\").  I found the \\"truth circle\\" scene where one of the newcomers was being given constant advice on how to speak from one's heart hilarious.  But I can see why many reviewers didn't like this movie.  It was a bit rushed and it portrayed many of the indulgent aspects of boomers/hippies living in communes (intentional communities) where at one point the owner of the facility admitted that he had missed out on a lot of life by remaining in his cocoon.  The poorly done trailer probably added to its unpopularity. I think this movie is basically good natured while offering an educational peek into an alternative way of living.
030758836X|1.0|I wish I had read more of the one star reviews before I wasted my money on this book.  The first part of it sounds like a teenage diary, except the female character is in her 30's. The middle started to pick up, and then started to be beyond belief.  The ending made me feel like I needed to take a shower for some reason.  It was awful, and makes me wonder about this author in several ways, none of them very good.
030758836X|3.0|This is such a well written page-turning or Kindle-clicking story. It is so good with  twists and turns and then in the last third it starts getting convoluted. And then, unfortunately, the ending is  a letdown and makes no sense to me.
B006LSZECO|3.0|While I loved the first part of the book, it really made me feel like I needed to keep going to see what happened. The author wrote such a detailed and engrossing tale but then lost it. I felt the ending was not from the same book. I just couldn't see it happening. I wonder WHY she chose to go there. I do think it was entertaining even if I felt betrayed with the whole ending... Decide for yourself,
B008EQIEWS|2.0|Not sure why Disney released this movie so quickly after the first one.  I really enjoyed the first installment a couple of years ago...great storyline and special effects.  This movie, though, is terribly uncohesive and confuses one quite easily with about 87 different subplots.  Yes, the special effects still rock, but the plot is as thin as paper.  It's terrible!  Rent this one only if you love computer graphics and care nothing about storyline.  I actually felt a bit sorry for the actors here as they definitely deserved something better.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Best game ever! I cant put it down! Just wish the full version was free!  :-)<br />O_o Still a very addicting game!!!!!

B007Q0OUKS|4.0|I was very excited when I recieved this set, and with good reason. this is a really nifty set, and LOTR did not fail to deliver the fun that I have previously had with their other merchandise, video games, etc. however, not everyone is able to be pleased. I personally think this set is a little over priced for beng what is reffered to as an \\"army builder\\" set. if it were cheaper, say $18, I would definetly have bought more than one of them in order to connect them and expand my LOTR world. unfortunatly, I could only get one because of the price. overall, I give this 4 stars because while it is amazing, its a little pricey. Thank LOTR!

B0085A9J18|5.0|Again. Simply the Best. The only reason for writing this review, one, is compelled to write, having and still practicing martial arts, loving cinema, motion, understanding the value of movies like ShawShank, the recent(s), 'Detachment' and `The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel', and European cinema, `The Chorus' and thousands of others, and without even reading the comments of the 2 critics with two stars and one star, found here, these people simply shouldn't be allowed or even bother with criticizing. As an American president, his name escapes me, said, the critics, or was it a British Prime Minister, the critics are the failed writers. OBJECTIVELY, the best action movie made SO FAR! Full stop! On all counts. Scenes. Continuous fight flow. Realism. NO need to explain oneself. Again, THE BEST ACTION MOVIE SO FAR!!!!!!
B008CWD17M|5.0|30 Years later these 4 men continue to defy the odds and prove that great musicians can produce great melodic songs.

Don't miss this wonderfully crafted album of great songs and superior production and playing! Asia....Simply the BEST!!
B00846REIS|3.0|I purchased this book because it was compared to \\"Fifty Shades\\" by many reviewers. Even if Fifty lacks in literary skill, (and I can't really judge that because english is not my native language) the plot  and the characters develop in a way that kept me attached to the story beyond the sex. That's what really kept my interest all the way through the three books. In a way, EL James managed to justify the actions of her characters and the changes that transform them from beginning to end.<br />\\"Bared to you\\" on the other hand, is a bit more literary, the language richer, and therefore less repetitive than Fifty. But I wasn't at all impressed by the story or the characters. Eva Tramell seemed to be lacking something to make me relate to her at any level. Her feelings and reactions seem to be all over the place most of the time, not to mention Gideon's. There is no rhyme nor reason to substantiate the way they relate with eachother. In my opinion, Gideon is just a bored, needy boy that finds a getaway very arbitrarily through Eva, but I never understood why.<br />If he'd held on to his unattached, uncommitted, cold persona at least for a while, the rest would be a little more beleivable to me. Instead, they run into eachother one day, and the next he can't live without her anymore. Is it just the great sex? Or because she's so \\"broken\\"? Perhaps he's just looking for a submissive and he finally found someone damaged enough?<br />I was expecting a much stronger female character, with a horrible past but solid spirit. A dominant (like Christian) that wouldn't take crap from anyone, especially from herself. All the unreasonable drama Eva inflicts on us truly disturbed me and the way Gideon deals with it even more. There never seems to be a substantial reason for Eva's tantrums, making me think several times \\"Oh no... here she goes again...\\" Which is probably what Gideon should be thinking, but instead he puts up with it and just appeases her insanity by giving her multipleorgasms. Like giving a candy to a child to keep him from nagging you.<br />In \\"Fifty shades of Grey\\", Christian knows what he wants from the beginning and holds on to it. He puts up a great fight before admiting he's in love with Ana, and we don't expect it to be any other way. It's a gradual and stressful transformation because he's damaged, and our heroine is strong enough to take the painful journey with him despite her insecurities and inexperience. They're both strong and weak in their own way, creating a credible balance, and I was able to relate to that. The end of the first book truly breaks your heart, making you want to sink your teeth immediately into the second one.<br />It was not the case at all with \\"Bared to you\\". Nothing makes you hold on to it, no cliffhanger, nothing. It seems to me that the story line is only a means to provide a lot of unnecessary drama and justify the very, VERY graphic sex scenes which ultimately, become very, VERY boring.<br />Honestly, I'll read the second book only to see if the story develops somehow and proves me wrong.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|I wanted to wait a few days before submitting a review to see if you really do have to spend extra cash to beat it or spend countless hours grinding it out in endless mode. Turns ou t you don't. I got stuck on one mission so I redid a past mission a couple of times for some $$$, upgraded my station (recommend upgrading structure health so your precious guns don't die in two hits) and continued on. No big deal and not really too challenging. It's a good game.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Great movie for those who are realist.  While the movie focuses on Special Ops, in the end it is dedicated to all those warriors who serve.

B006O6EOII|5.0|I adore every monster high doll there is. This Ghoulia doll have very cute skates that actually roll which i thought was unique. Being my 1st Ghoulia doll i am very pleased with it. I think thats the helmet is cute and matches Ghoulia very well. The only thing is that when u try to roll her without holding her sturdy, she may lean down or lean back. Overall i would recommend this doll to any monster high lover! :)

1466401885|2.0|In spite of the many glowing reviews, I feel this could have been so much better. During the first half of the book I truly cared about Abby and hoped that Travis would somehow redeem himself and change his violent, possessive ways. Unfortunately, the second half of the story fell flat for me simply because there were so many things which seemed implausible and I kept wondering where the adults were. By the end of the book I simply felt let down by a story that had the potential to be a great deal more.
B005LAIGYQ|1.0|This is a great movie, but I have only seen it on my laptop computer.  It will not play on either of the DVD players that I bought from Best Buy in the USA, and it won't play in my portable region-free DVD player.  I haven't had any problems with any of the other movies I've rented or bought in America, but this one just won't play.  This is very frustrating.  And no, I'm not stupid--this is the standard version, not the Blue Ray, and it won't play in my DVD player that is Blue Ray.  I recommend you don't buy this movie on Amazon.  Get it in a real store.
B006YZOXHQ|4.0|Before there was \\"Star Wars,\\" there was \\"Barbarella,\\" based on a French comic story by Jean-Claude Forest.  Sci-fi in theme, but quite erotic in nature, Barbarella (Jane Fonda) is an interplanetary traveller from Earth who is sent by the President to find and bring home Dr. Duran Duran, a scientist whose shipped crashed on a planet.  Along the way to finding him, she encounters a number of odd humans, including an angel (John Phillip Law).  Quite true to the comic, the movie carried over many of the adult sequences (with an exception of a risque encounter with a robot).<br /><br />This is a delightful film, never to be taken seriously, and never to be considered high cinema, LOL.  It's pure (well, not so pure) adult fun.  And never has there been a title sequence in which they float all over the screen but it's pretty much guaranteed you will never even see any of them.  You will have to see the film to understand what I mean.<br /><br />Largely psychedelic in nature, the story owes a lot to the adventures of Flash Gordon.  The movie is filled with bright colors, good costumes, amazing sets, fair special effects, and an excellent cast, naming among the, the famous mime, Marcel Marceau, in a speaking role, mostly unrecognizable as Professor Ping.<br /><br />The video is excellent, very clean, and where there may be some softness, this was obviously in the original film.  It is doubtful we will ever see a better print of it.<br /><br />Audio is good, with most of it front speakers.<br /><br />The only extra is a trailer.  It's a shame because this is a film that was a unique product of its time (1968) and should have at least had a commentary.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended.
B002QGSW8I|4.0|THE LOWDOWN: The SIGMA Force faces off against their arch-enemies at the Guild to get to the bottom of an ancient mystery involving the Domesday Book that may yield bio-weapons potential for their shadowy cabal. Always a treat, but this book is a standard entry in the series.<br /><br />THE PLOT: A series of assassinations across the globe draws SIGMA into the Guild's latest nefarious scheme, which involves an age-old curse that makes people hungry. In an effort to understand the \\"curse,\\" SIGMA attempts to dig into its origins, which have to do with the person who history now knows as Merlin, while the Guild follows hot on their heels to exploit the curse/plague's origins for their own mysterious purposes.<br /><br />THE PROS: This book focuses more on the historical mystery rather than the science, and I think the book fared better because of it. The Indiana Jones-esque \\"ancient trap\\" scenes were exciting, and I was intrigued by the theory set forth about where the Fomorians, and \\"Merlin\\" came from. I liked the Ivar Karlsen character, since he was neither a hero nor a villain, but rather, a man trying to do what he viewed as the right thing. I also enjoyed the insights into Seichan's character in this story. Other highlights include a wild chase through Rome's Colosseum, and a vivid, nightmarish, fiery deathtrap in a peat bog.<br /><br />THE CONS: As much as I hate to admit it, I really don't buy the romance between Italian cop Rachel and SIGMA agent Grayson. The attraction between Gray and Seichan is more believable. The plot was good, but just seemed like a replay of the \\"Guild tries to snatch a bio-weapon\\" plot that the Judas Strain centered on. There was also a particular scene involving polar bears that I found to be quite silly.

0061785652|5.0|THE LOWDOWN: As SIGMA pits its wills against the Guild once again for control of an ancient, deadly substance, some information os brought to light concerning precisely who their mysterious enemies are, and exactly how long they've been around. I enjoyed this book immensely, and I would go as far as to say it's the best SIGMA story since Black Order.<br /><br />THE PLOT: When SIGMA director Painter Crowe's niece is accused of terrorism, he investigates and discovers that the real threats are mysterious stores of ancient nanotechnological compounds (brought to the States by one of the Lost Tribes of Israel), which are incredibly deadly. Of course, this means the Guild wants to get its slimy hands on them. As the SIGMA agents attempt to stop their enemies from doing so, they discover that Meriwether Lewis embarked on this same quest ages ago, also being pursued by the Guild, which have been present in the United States since its very founding.<br /><br />THE PROS: This book could be my new favorite in the series. The central nanocompound threat is very frightening, and the Guild agents trying to grab it are some of the nastiest villains yet. Painter's extended family turn out to be some very interesting characters who I thoroughly enjoyed reading about, and I was pleased to see Grayson and Seichan working side by side again. The insight into the origins of the Guild are exciting, and make me feel like the story is building to something, rather than just continuing more of the same. Other highlights include a helicopter vs. horse chase, a shootout in a college lab, an escape from an erupting volcano, and our heroes being chased by a wall of boiling mud. Rollins knows how to throw genuine thrills and originality into his action.<br /><br />THE CONS: Rollins never fully explains how the nanotech compound came to be, and by now the readers seem to need to accept that the Egyptians and Israelites were capable of magic feats. I assume that Rollins is going somewhere with this plot point, however, so I forgive.is plot point, however, so I forgive.
B00064VRHU|5.0|Great movie. Lots of fun. Never get tired of it. Great movie. Lots of fun. Never get tired of it.
0062017926|4.0|THE LOWDOWN: The newest installment in my favorite book series, the SIGMA Force novels, pits the titular organization against a mysterious bio-terrorist group that has been shadowing them for the past two novels, in an attempt to stop the outbreak of an ancient plague. Along the way, both sides discover the true nature of angels and demons here on Earth.<br /><br />THE PLOT: A mysterious plague breaks out in the waters of Indonesia, infecting a cruise ship, which is taken over by the bio-terror faction known as the Guild, while Grayson Peirce's family is taken hostage by an agent of the same group. Both groups of Guild operatives are tugging at different ends of the same conspiracy to harness the power of an ancient plague and turn it into a bio-weapon.<br /><br />THE PROS: As with the past two installments, this book has a cast of varied and interesting characters, a historical and science fiction mystery to solve, and a lot of gunfights and chases along the way. The cynobacteria plague threatening the Indonesian cruise ship is a truly horrifying one, and it was well explained thanks to Rollins' research. The love interest here was handled much better, because I feel that Grayson and his sexy frenemy Seichan have a natural chemistry.<br /><br />THE CONS: The ultimate function of the disease was kind of garbled, but in the context of angels vs. demons, I think I understood it. These stories usually build up to a slam bang science-meets-supernatural climax, but in this story, the supernatural part was kinda absent in the final confrontation and wasn't revealed until the very end, which left me a little disappointed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read literally thousands of books in my life and this story ranks among the best in my experience.  It is listed in the Sci-Fi genre but the storyline covers a broader spectrum of readers.  It is not deep Sci-FI but a story based on an apocalyptic event that leaves only a few human survivors living in a silo under the earth.  It is massive with 144 levels and they have been living there for generations and over 200 years.  It is a dystopian society with castes of people who each have their own tasks to do for the benefit of all.<br /><br />The storyline goes deep into character development and the main protagonist is Juliette.  You will feel her pain, her love and her bravery as her part in the story is so brilliantly written that is it simply a masterpiece.  Once you start this book you will not be able to stop until you have finished.  I immediately purchased the new book titled \\"First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series)\\" because I loved the style of the writing in this book.<br /><br />I will not ruin the book for you by giving away any of the storyline but I can assure you that this story is masterfully written and Hugh Howey is one of the best new authors of the last 10 years.  I understand the movie rights have been purchased and if they can make the movie as good as the book it will be the next Hunger Games style of smash hit movie.<br /><br />Mr. Howey, thank you for the hours of reading enjoyment that I got from buying your book.  I have already purchased the next one.  Congratulations on your great story!

0385333846|5.0|I wanted to read this book simply because it was one of the classics I'd always heard about but somehow missed reading in school. (Catch-22 and To Kill a Mockingbird are on that list too.)  Once I started reading it, I had a hard time putting it down.  It's an easy read, and a difficult one all at once: well-written but confusing. The time-traveling that Billy Pilgrim does is however not at all confusing, and I can't express how impressive that is; his story is all over the place but always makes sense. And knowing that the author really experienced parts of this story makes it even more powerful. It gets confusing though when some characters seem both real and caricatured at the same time, or when Pilgrim's belief in alien abduction and time travel start melding with sci-fi books he's read, or events that have happened to him, and it's never clear if he's truly experiencing time travel or if it's all some kind of post-traumatic stress after his experiences in World War II. I have a feeling that, for the point Vonnegut was trying to make, it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />I have to agree with those who say this isn't just an anti-war novel. It is anti-war, but it doesn't brow-beat, and it seems to me to be more about the absurdity and cruelty of people in general, not just during wartime.  To take the Tralfamadorians as an extension of humanity, they refuse to observe anything that upsets them; they only pay attention to times that are beautiful and happy. And in doing so, they refuse to stop the destruction of the universe, which is caused by one of their own. They know it will happen, and how; but they don't want to think about it. This idea can certainly be applied to war, and especially to World War II in more ways than one; but it can also be easily applied to anyone in everyday life.<br /><br />I wish I'd read this book in high school, but I'm glad I read it now. There are some cases of swearing and sexuality, so I wouldn't recommend it to a younger audience. But otherwise, I recommend it.

1568363931|5.0|I'll admit I haven't made any recipes yet, though they all look fairly simple. I've been around the bento guides and this is the most concise and useful book I've seen. And the recipes for sides (pickles and whatnot) are measured for individual portions, which is great. Unless you really like a particular item or are making many bentos, it's a pain to make a whole batch of something to pack a few tablespoons of it.<br /><br />That said, I HAVE used the \\"How to Properly Cook Rice\\" page a couple times and I'm impressed! I didn't realize that using a towel to absorb some of the steam after the cooking made a difference, but it does! My white rice is soft and fresh-tasting, and I can actually chew the brown rice (unlike the brown rice that comes out of my rice cooker on the 'brown rice' setting...) so I can safely assume the recipes will be just as solid.

0425263908|4.0|I hate the idea of a trendy book.  When everyone starts gushing about the same thing, I want to head in the opposite direction.  And it's not fair. Popular doesn't necessarily mean \\"bad.\\"  The thing is, that doesn't always mean it's good either.  I've heard this book touted as an alternative to 50 Shades of Gray.  That did not make me want to read it. If anything, it kept me away, because from what I've heard about 50, it's not my kind of book. But I can tell you with 100% certainty, this book lives up to the hype. Not the 50 Shades part, because I have no frame of reference there.  But it's definitely the angsty, erotic, tortured story I was promised.<br /><br />The book follows two extremely damaged people as they try to navigate a relationship. Gideon Cross is an ubersexy billionaire who doesn't believe in mixing sex and emotions.  Eva is a young ad agency assistant who works in the same building and is trying to live a normal life after a childhood filled with sexual abuse.  When they cross paths, there is an electric connection. Gideon wants to negotiate sex like a business deal.  Eva needs more and she turns him down, making his interest burn even brighter.<br /><br />He makes it his mission to have her, but finds the tables turned when he falls completely in love with her.  There is sooo much baggage.  Eva is up front about her abusive past, but Gideon tries to shove his down. He tries and he fails.  What we end up with is two people who want each other desperately, tied together by mindblowing sex and a need to be loved.  The question becomes whether individuals as dysfunctional as they are, can really make it work as a couple.<br /><br />Will this be everyone's cup of tea?  No. I was very slow to warm up to the story and even considered putting it down at first. I found Gideon to be very arrogant and off-putting at the beginning of the book. And it was hard to find much respect for Eva when she was wetting her pants over him while simultaneously being offended by his boorish behavior.  Also, the sexual abuse issue is an integral element of the story. The relationship is, in part, a struggle for sexual dominance between two partners who have a history of being forced into submission by other people.  I am not a fan of d/s relationships in books, most often because I'm turned off by what feels like demeaning of the sub.  But I didn't feel that way here.<br /><br />That's not to say that there aren't colossally bad decisions made by both of these characters.  They are terribly emotionally stunted, and cling to one another like lifelines.  Their past hurts make them to try shield themselves and it often has unfortunate consequences.  For Gideon, this manifests in possessive and stalkerish behavior and for Eva, it's running away when she gets hurt.  But that same damage within them is also what makes them so sympathetic. It makes their frantic need for each other feel real and it makes me want them to have their happy ending, if only to ease the hurt.<br /><br />Plus, the sex is really hot, even if one questions the believability of that kind of stamina.<br /><br />Rating: B+ded by his boorish behavior.

B005H29GSI|5.0|Okay, so the game is rated for kids 5 and up, and I read a few people's reviews on this game saying that their kids couldn't do this game by themselves and they were 5+ years old... I think it depends on the kid!!!  My child JUST turned 3 and he loves playing Angry Birds on his Kindle Fire, he especially loves the Space version but plays Rio, Seasons, and the original version as well.  That being said, I bought the Knock on Wood game thinking he wouldn't use the cards because of his age, and just play his own way.  WRONG.  My child loves this series of games, he builds the structures BY HIMSELF using the cards!!!  It is a lot of fun, he will build one structure (Even level 300!) and then I will launch the birds and knock it down.  Then I will build a structure and he will knock it down launching the birds.  TONS of fun.  Granted, if you buy only ONE of these games, buy the Knock on Wood game, as the birds you get (black, yellow, red) and the wood colored pieces is a better set.  Otherwise, when you buy more than one set it makes the freestyle building more fun.  In fact, we just purchased the Mega Smash set from Amazon and hope to have even more fun building structures.  The Mega Smash set comes with blue bird, black bird, yellow bird, and white bird plus 4 pigs (it should be here tomorrow).  I also added the large Angry Birds Indoor/Outdoor game to my cart to purchase later to play outdoors.  I think taking the video game and making these fun board games is great, because the child takes a break from the video game and plays an interactive board game with family members or friends.  Plus, it is great for learning sharing for the younger kids, and also hand eye coordination and connection by using the cards to build the structures.  Children have to think to match the pieces they are using to the cards.  5 stars for the whole series from this family!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00867PS8S Angry Birds Indoor and Outdoor 3D Action Game]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004U52VPS Angry Birds: Knock On Wood Game]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PSMZ9O Mattel Angry Birds Exclusive Board Game Mega Smash]]

B0060AY6FO|3.0|I bought this in hardcover (nearly $25!) because I was on vacation, picked it up, and was hooked.  The first few pages were very entertaining as James summarized the happy ending of P&P.  But it quickly became rather solemn and dull.  We got very little of Elizabeth at all, and not a bit of romance between her and Darcy -- for which my appetite was whetted after remembering all the pride and prejudice involved when they fell in love.<br /><br />Most puzzling was the circuitous route to solving the \\"mystery.\\"  It was neither very fascinating nor well told.  A whole lot of folks we didn't care much about were involved.<br /><br />The language seemed appropriate, and the tone accurate -- something many would-be Austen imitators can't manage at all.  But nowhere in evidence was the sense of humor or playfulness of the original.<br /><br />I did enjoy the ending, where events were wrapped up, characters explained, and loose ends from the first book tied up.<br /><br />I am, however, sorry to say that I would not recommend this book very highly.  And I so wanted to love it!

B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I was turned off completely by the language used and the life style of the \\"heroine\\".  It is trash.  I have liked a lot of Ophra's book suggestions and was disapponted with this one.  I only had to suffer through a few pages to wish I hadn't wasted money on this book.
0439023513|2.0|This book was extremely disappointing. There was a lack of action. Instead of Katniss being engaged in the war, she spends most of her time filming videos for District 13 to air, or sleeping due to being drugged. Since the book is told from Katniss's point of view, the reader misses out on all of the action happening while she's asleep, and the author decides to give the reader a two paragraph summary of what Katniss missed out on, some of which were major plot points in the book - the rescue of Peeta and the assassination of President Snow. These summaries caused the pacing of the book to become rushed, especially in the final chapters and epilogue, and it felt like Collins was simply trying to get writing the book over with.

Couple that with an almost unintellgible plot, a tepic villain, and bad directing, and this movie isnt even worth a redbox special.<br /><br />Do yourself and eat some paint chips instead of watching this, at least the lead will dull your mind less.

006197806X|5.0|What a wonderful follow up novel to Lauren Oliver's dystopian, Delirium.  Where many sequels flounder or just fall flat, Pandemonium delivers and grows on its predecessor. The novel is split into alternating chapters of \\"then\\" and \\"now\\".  The \\"then\\" chapters complete the tale of what happens to Lena after Delirium finishes and she is fighting to escape and survive in the Wilds without Alex.  The \\"now\\" chapters show Lena back in society as a Resistance agent.<br /><br />Delirium left you on such a cliffhanger, I needed to know what happened next.  Oliver managed to deliver a sequel where she strung you out the entire book before giving that information.  Normally this is something that would have left me twitchy and irritated, however the book is just that good I never once felt exasperated at all.  What you get is a book that isn't shy of being harsh and painful.  It makes you think twice about about how we behave as individuals and shows the strength and resiliance of humanity regardless of what is thrown at them. Where Delirium explores Lena's growth and love, Pandemonium is about the darker emotions like hate and revenge all of which are still considered part of \\"the\\" disease, amor deliria nervosa.<br /><br />\\"If he were less well trained, and less careful, he would say hate. But he can't say it; it is too close to passion, and passion is too close to love, and love is amor deliria nervosa, the deadliest of all deadly things: It is the reason for the games of pretend, for the secret selves, for the spasms in the throat.\\"<br /><br />There were many scenes in this novel that deeply impacted me, often by what Oliver leaves unsaid, once scene in particular with Raven, Blue and Lena left me in tears it was so harsh and beautiful. The writing is just superb, I can't fault it.  Where Crossed so desperately tries to be poetic, deep and meaningful and falls short at the mark, Pandemonium delivers in spades.  The story and writing is fluid, soulful you really empathise with the characters and can feel the hopelessness and uphill battle of trying to change their society.<br /><br />Lena really grows in this novel, she states that the old Lena is dead and in some ways this definitely feels true.  The new Lena is much tougher after surviving the wilds and joining the resistance. She at times seems numb and dead due to the shock of losing Alex and her entire way of life.  There are a few new secondary characters introduced who are well done and really enhance Lena's journey through the Wilds and I can't not mention Julian, her new love interest.  I wanted to dislike him, I really did but I just couldn't.  Julian, like Lena is all about discovery, growth and acceptance that they are different to the rest of their society.  He is sweet, he is genuine and I really felt for him and could see the love blossoming between them even if Lena resisted and battled it.<br /><br />I can't sing this series enough praises.  If you haven't read Delirium yet, please go pick it up and get as hooked on it as I am.  Pandemonium is a wonderful sequel and I am on tenterhooks just waiting to see how everything comes together in the final book!h the characters and can feel the hopelessness and uphill battle of trying to change their society.<br /><br />Lena really grows in this novel, she states that the old Lena is dead and in some ways this definitely feels true.

B0080R7Q70|4.0|After a multi-year hiatus, preceded by a couple of disappointing albums, the Flower Kings are back (with yet another new drummer). Did their break help? Overall, I'd have to say yes.<br /><br />The album starts with the ~24 minute epic \\"Numbers\\". There are several references to some of their older songs at the beginning, presumably a signal that they want to get back to their roots. I don't know if I'd class this among their classics, but it is a solid piece, and unlike may other epics doesn't feel like either a series of short songs strung together or a needlessly drawn out song. This is followed by 4 shorter songs, and some versions have an additional disc with bonus songs.<br /><br />The style of the music is very typical Flower Kings - they aren't really breaking any new ground here. Apparently it was basically recorded \\"live\\" in the studio to get a more real sound, instead of the over-processed to perfection sound often used these days. The album maybe doesn't have the energy or anthemic choruses present on their first few albums, but overall the songwriting is strong and all members of the band are at the top of their form. It's also a lot more consistent than some of their earlier work - maybe none of these songs will be considered among the band's true classics, but there aren't really any weak pieces either.<br /><br />Overall I think this is probably the band's best album since Unfold the Future. If you like the Flower Kings or classic progressive rock, this album is a good bet.
0553386794|5.0|I came to George R.R. Martin quite recently, after having bought &#34;season 1&#34; which roughly correspond to Game of Thrones (there is a little bit concerning Arya at the end in the TV series which in fact is from book 2). This volume has already attracted hundreds of reviews, most of which are extremely positive, and I can understand why and definitely share the feeling. Rather than paraphrasing what others have already mentioned perhaps a couple of years ago, I would like to insist on what a huge and superb job George R.R. Martin has done in creating a whole fantasy world. This is what has prompted some reviewers to compare him to Tolkien. I am not even sure that the term &#34;fantasy world&#34; is entirely appropriate, however. This is because, at times, you get almost the impression that this is just as much &#34;alternative history&#34; as fantasy: there is only a little magic - no wizards - at least in the first volume, although there are dragons, walking dead, extraordinary wolves and mention of other non-human creatures living beyond the Wall. The world that he has created is loosely based on bits and pieces aggregated from the Ancient history and the Middle Ages in Europe, and in the United Kingdom, in particular, and, to a lesser extent, Asia. Here are a few examples:<br />- The maps of Westeros, the land of the Seven Kingdoms, make you think of a somewhat modified version of Britain. You can recognize the general shape, although it has been modified quite a bit and distances have been multiplied by a factor of eight or ten because Westeros is a whole continent, as opposed to a big island<br /><br />- The analogies go further. The Wall seem to have been loosely inspired by either Hadrian's Wall or Antonin's Wall, which was further to the north . The Night Watch seems to be loosely inspired by the Military Orders of the Middle Ages, at least with regards the vows that the applicants have to pronounce in order to join, renouncing whatever property (land in particular) and family and with pronouncing vows of celibacy. The recruitment mode is a little different, although Military Orders did also in some cases accept criminals who were ready to join them to do penance and atone for their crimes. Regarding knights, however, those who joined the historical Orders generally did so of their own free will, as opposed to being send or somewhat forced to join the Night Watch<br /><br />- The society of the Seven Kingdoms resembles the 15th century, given the castles and the equipment of the knights (plate armour, helmets, jousting and so on...), and the civil wars that take place once the King has died reminded me of the War of the Roses. The conflict seems to be just as bloody and treason is just as common. The only difference is perhaps that, up to now, noble families do not seem to change sides as frequently as they did during the War of the Roses, although this is only the first book, and there is plenty of time for this to happen in subsequent volumes<br /><br />- There are also other historical references. The name and description of the Dothraki suggests a parallel with the Thracians of Antiquity and perhaps also with the Skythians, although their eyes could suggest a reference to Asian steppe nomads (pick your choice: they were dozens of them between the Huns around AD 350 and the Mongols almost a thousand years latter. Both the Thracians and the Scythians sacrificed their warlord's horse during his funeral so that he could ride it in the underworld, although only the latter used horse archers. The reference to &#34;arakhs&#34;, the swords, or perhaps more accurately the kind of sabres used by the Dothraki, also points to the Rhompaia of the Thracians, although there are differences. The historical rhompaia (which was also used by the Dacians) was a two-handed sword made of straightened scythe held and a long handle that could make up to half the length of the weapon. The blade was particularly sharp and the weapon was dreaded by Roman legionaries because it could loop of limbs. For those wanting to read more on the Thracians, and check some of the staements above, try &#34;The Gods of Battle&#34; by Chris Webber<br /><br />- Other, but somewhat less precise, allusions to historical references include the Forest people (not Elfes, as in Tokien's Lord of the Ring, but more probably inspired by pre-Celtic populations of the British Isles), The First Men, mostly in the North, who seem to have been inspired by the Celts and the Andals. I initially thought that the latter may allude to the Angles, Jutes and Saxons, because the word was close to &#34;Vandals&#34;, who were also Germanic, although the Andals and the the mention of Stormkings who ruled before the Targaryens, could also allude to the Danes and the Targaryen conquerors, who invaded Westeros almost three centuries before the beginning of this story, would then allude to the Normand Kings of England. The Free Cities, on another continent, which, combined with the character of Illyrio, made me think of independent Greek Cities in something like 500 BCE.<br /><br />In addition to being a very entertaining romp and adventure story where, for the time being at least, three stories happen in parallel, I found the characters rather well drawn and well through, contrary to what some reviewers seem to have experienced. There are, of course, &#34;goodies&#34; and &#34;baddies&#34;, but they are not caricatures. As another reviewer mentioned, the characters are various shades of grey, which makes them somewhat more realistic, rather than being painted in black or white. Even Robb replacing his father as the Warden of the North at the age of fourteen is not as far-fetched as it may first seem when you take a look at the 15th century in the English Kingdom. A historical character such as the Duke Richard of York (the future Richard the Third) fought his first battle alongside his brother Edward, the Yorkist King, at age fourteen. Shortly after the victory, his brother actually put him in charge of the North of England. At the time, of course, you were old by the time you were 40. You were married at 15 and you had had your first children by the time you were 20. All this is also perfectly well rendered in this book.<br /><br />So, in addition to all of the other praise and qualities that others have found in this book, I particularly appreciated the attention to details and how the author recreated a society based on the Late Middle Ages and made it as realistic as he could.<br /><br />Highly recommended and I can only hope that the next volume, which I am jujst about to begin, is as good as this one.s dreaded by Roman legionaries because it could loop of limbs.

B002436WFI|3.0|The film tried to combine \\"Color of Magic\\" and \\"Light Fantastic\\" into three hours, so a lot of great stuff was left out. I have a feeling anyone who hadn't read the books would spend most of movie saying, \\"Huh? What just happened?\\" Still, if you love the Discworld, you have to see this one. Sean Astin wouldn't have been my first choice for the role of Twoflower, but to my surprise he was perfect.

B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I bought this album after hearing \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" and finding that it was priced at 99 cents for a one-day special. So, I gave it a listen and I found that I would have bought it even if it had cost the normal price of 7.99. All of the tracks are unique, fun and they melt seamlessly into one another. The tracks are great by themselves as well, as Pandora Internet Radio has shown me after numerous listens to \\"Save Me,\\" \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" and others before I bought the album. My favorite songs from the album are \\"Save Me,\\" \\"In Your Light,\\" \\"Easy Way Out\\" and \\"Somebody That I Used To Know.\\"

B006LSZECO|1.0|I bought Gone girl cos it was shown in Time magazine as one of the good reads of the summer, also the reviews I read were unfortunately the 4 and 5 stars. Then I started reading.. it had an interesting start and the suspense was good .. I loved the way she unfolded the different sub plots. However by the last 1/3 of the book it all starting going down hill, I was making excuses to keep myself reading hoping to atleast have a great ending. To me a great ending can be either happy, sad or even just an unexpected but believable angle. This booked lacked any of that criteria. I dropped the book with a sigh.<br /><br />I had planned to buy her other books before reading this and wanted to use this to gauge her writing style, i must say as an ambassador for her story telling skills, this book does a bad job.I will most likely still buy her book, i do think she knows how to spin a story and maybe deserves the benefit of doubt.
B007ZZKWHY|4.0|Film is awesome.  Downfall spoof was funny.<br />Blu-Ray has a problem with the 'Promo' sub-menu.  All the links in the sub-menu do not work.  I'm guessing that these are the web trailers.  The movie, trailer and making of menus all work.  Disappointed with the making of portion: a little over 16 minutes of the film being shot.  No commentary or dialogue, even subtitled non-English commentary would have been appreciated (movie also).  Given the price, the BD was a little skimpy on extras.
1455523003|5.0|Christopher Hitchens is a fantastic writer, but this book is not up to his usual standards.  It is very short and was probably done quickly.  It is at bottom a polemic against Mother Teresa.  It is not a well documented investigative report.  It leaves out an enormous amount of detail that would support his case.  The take down of MT should be done in a much larger work.  Apparently MT spent much of her latter life jetting around the world and staying in luxury hotels and getting treatment at fine clinics which which makes her a hypocrite in of the highest degree.  But Hitchens doesn't detail these things, he just mentions them.  In that regard it was disappointing.<br /><br />It needs to be pointed out that Hitchens does not make up what he says about her for the most part.  He sources it with her own words and with others who worked in her organizations.  I'm not so sure she would deny most of what he said, he seems to imply she doesn't.<br /><br />I hate hero worship.  I especially hate hero worship of people who don't deserve it.  You don't have to agree with Hitchens but at least read the damn book before you comment on it.  I give this book five stars because it is a rare person that takes on the great mother like Hitchens does in this book.  Some others have but most have been ignored by the popular press.  She needs to be taken down a notch and we need to remove from her the fawning worship she so often received in life and continues to receive after death.

1469984202|5.0|Hugh Howey is on the way to becoming one of my favorite writers.  From the reviews of his other books it looks like he is consistently great.  I can't say from personal experience, because Wool is the first of his books that I've read.  So, I plan on reading more of his writing.  If it is as good as Wool Howey will be near the top.  Wool is one of my favorite Sci-Fi books, along with Ender's Game and Dune.  The writing flows very well and doesn't get bogged down.  I found every page enjoyable.<br /><br />Wool has a very unique story and is about the human dynamic as much as it is about Sci-Fi.  His character development is great.  The story procedes at a nice pace and near the end I was burning through the pages to see how it would end.  And, I found myself thinking about the book between readings, because I read it over about a week as I had time.  The plot wasn't predictable to me.  Often I have a pretty good idea of how a book will end, can see a plot twist coming, etc.  No so with Wool.<br /><br />Also, I don't like it when a Sci-Fi writer gets on their soapbox about politics, religion, or evolution.  To me, some writers come across as having an agenda to push evolution.  I appreciate it when a writer doesn't do that.  I don't read some authors because of that.  Howey isn't like that in Wool, so that allowed me to enjoy the story even more.<br /><br />It doesn't matter very much, but... I liked the larger print.  Not huge, not tiny, just right.  Some books have a bit smaller print and I have to use my reading glasses.

B002LC2DQ4|5.0|This was the only place where this particular memory card that I needed was still being sold. So naturally it was what I needed, wanted, expected, and ordered. Bought my digital camera in 2007 and was surprised to learn it's already obsolete since newer memory cards are all high definition and this one isn't. Anyway, I was glad to get it except when I went to print the pictures, taken the night before at a wedding, and discovered a problem ---- it claimed there were no pictures on it. When the card was back in the camera it was telling me power off and format. After calling Olympus I went to a camera store where luckily they were able to recover the pictures for a $30 fee and then when they tried to format the card it wouldn't. In other words it was kaput, defective.

B007ZBWJXI|4.0|After two average/good-in-places reunion albums (Phoenix and Omega), Asia has finally captured the balance of strong strongwriting with dynamic performances that marked their 1982 debut. Although 1983's \\"Alpha\\" carried stellar songs, the muddied thick mix and the downplaying of Steve Howe's guitar playing marred the release and the band imploded shortly afterwards.<br /><br />30 years year and XXX is the album that best carries forward the promise of the first album.The playing and performances are dynamic and energetic, with each member showing again why he is a master of his craft.In particular, Steve Howe and Geoff Downes shine throughout. Howe's guitar playing has been reignited (as evidenced on Yes' 2011 release, \\"Fly From Here\\") and Downes contributes some excellent keyboard runs and lines throughout the songs. For a man in his 60s, John Wetton sounds like he did in his 30s with a strong clear resonance. And Carl Palmer's drumming drives everything as he always has. From a production point-of-view, I miss the big drum sound that Palmer had on the debut. The recent reunion releases (Phoenix and Omega) have both left me lacking in the drum sound.<br /><br />Standout tracks: \\"Bury Me In Willow\\", \\"Al Gatto Nero\\", \\"Face On The Bridge\\",\\"Tomorrow The World\\", \\"No Religion\\"<br /><br />In short: ADD this to your Asia catalog! Easily the strongest playing since \\"Asia\\" and the best collection of songs since \\"Alpha\\". Who would have thought that 30 years later Wetton,Downes,Howe & Palmer would give us the album we've been waiting for since then! Buy it now!

B007OYFDCA|5.0|EMI seems to be standing by the highly original Norwegian violinist Vilde Frang, now 25; this is her third solo album for them. A pairing of the Tchaikovsky and Nielsen concertos is unusual, but it follows a familiar commercial ploy: sweeten an out-of-the-way work with one that has proven sales appeal with general listeners. I've heard three new versions of the Tchaikovsky in the past few months, and this is a work where one recording (Heifetz or Oistrakh) has for me been enough. But new voices are always tempting, and Frang draws you in immediately.  She is confident and personal, phrasing with alert attention and no cliches, making us hear what she has to say because it's not factory stamped.  It also helps that she manages to be inward in passages usually played for effect to the gallery.<br /><br />the most personal violinists who have captured my interest in the same way are Sergey Khachatryan and Lisa Batiashvili. What they share is charisma and attention-grabbing musical instincts. None strikes me as a powerhouse player in the Oistrakh mold. they all set aside technical flash in favor of musical insight. Another asset on this disc is the well-considered accompaniment from rising Norwegian conductor Eivind Gullberg Jensen, who gets the Danish Radio SO to deliver committed playing that feels interested and sympathetic to his soloist. In the interest of balance, I will add that Frang's rubato and phrasing may strike some as too self-involved or indulgent. Perhaps she bends over backwards to keep the Tchaikovsky from sounding like a warhorse.<br /><br />The Nielsen is an unusual concerto, launching almost immediately into a free-form soliloquy from the violin in a rhapsodic Praeludium, which then transitions to a dreamy Largo rather than the expected Allegro. Apparently the work had a difficult birth before it premiered in 1912 on the same program as the rousing, optimistic Sym. #3 \\"Espansiva.\\" the general feeling seems more than a little to gypsy fiddling - the concerto was written for a Hungarian violinist who was also Nielsen's son-in-law. It might also be significant to Frang that the score was begun in Bergen, Norway (it was finished later back in Denmark).<br /><br />For a long time I've thought that no one could better the phenomenal reading given by Maxim Vengerov (on Teldec, 1996, with Barenboim), with a powerful challenge from Cho-Liang Lin (on Sony, 1989, with Salonen). The excellent Nikolaj Znaider offered a beautiful reading (on EMI, 2001, with Lawrence Foster).  For such a discursive, unusual work that speaks its own language, that is an embarrassment of riches. Frang's contribution has a special flavor, as if two free spirits, she and Nielsen, are vying to sound the most spontaneous. I won't say that oddity meets oddity, but she doesn't attempt to make the work sound more palatable or conventional to please the audience, nor does she overwhelm us with powerful technique as Vengerov does. Hers is the most intimate Nielsen Concerto I've heard, which is reason enough to hear it.<br /><br />Clearly this is an artist who will never be conventional, a very appealing trait as the wold's music conservatories keep turning out dazzling technicians who usually wind up not staying in the mind for musical reasons - Frang does.concerto was written for a Hungarian violinist who was also Nielsen's son-in-law.

B00633W614|4.0|I loved Only Time Will Tell and the way in which Archer told the story from different characters points of views in different chunks of time. This managed to tell multiple sides of the story that not all characters were privy to. Sins of the Father does the same picking up as Harry arrives in New York and it arrested for the crimes of the dead man whose name he claimed in order to protect Emma. The story mainly follows Harry and Giles and their experiences during the war and Emma's attempts to find Harry whom she refuses to believe died crossing the Atlantic. Some a few other characters also pick up the story weaving a engrossing story with enough questions and intrigue to keep the reader interested and will to pick up the next few novels in the series. The ending will also be a help in readers eagerly awaiting the next installment.

0425263908|5.0|Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: An intense and riveting erotic read that will play with your heart and emotions.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: \\"We should head to a bar and celebrate.\\"<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Bared to You is about love in a purely raw state. Eva Trammel is a 24-year old woman who has recently graduated and is ready to make her mark on the world. Eva has chose to take the simple path, found an entry-level position in a marketing firm, all without utilizing her wealthy stepfather's ties in the business world. Eva has moved to New York City on her own and is ready to begin her adult life on her own terms. In a meeting destined by fate, Eva runs into Gideon Cross. A young late twenty-something, Gideon is a successful and highly motivated industry giant.<br /><br />Sparks fly, and boy are they hot. Eva and Gideon are drawn to each other with a force like two magnets. Together, they are passionate enough that there is an unforgiving need. Individually, they have secrets and insecurities that destroy one another.<br /><br />Eva is very strong-willed, and rightfully so. With an overbearing and overprotective mother, Eva's life is constantly monitored, against her will. Eva craves independence and self-sufficiency, not only to be an adult, but also to overcome family scrutiny. Eva's journey to secure the foundations of her heart allows her to take a leap of faith. She allows her insecurities to get the better of her, and for a strong woman in the office, she's completely docile everywhere else.<br /><br />Gideon is definitely your dark, tall, and handsome male lead. Gideon is a force to be reckoned with, and he definitely commands your presence in every sense of the word. Gideon's career is controlled and fast-paced, but once he meets Eva, the dynamic and balance of that life is thrown off. There was a point where you instantly fall in love with who Gideon is as a person versus the image or persona of him. The intimate moments shared between Gideon and Eva show the reader this deep understanding of who he really is. Like an onion, there are so many layers to him, and lucky for Eva, she's the woman he's willing to open up to.<br /><br />Bared to You shows deep emotions and subjects that complements the romance and sexual relationship of the book. I couldn't put the book down. There are heavy erotic details in this book, and not for the faint of heart. Explicit images and passionate positions cover the pages, and boy did I enjoy them. But erotica isn't the only thing about Bared to You that made this an enjoyable read. Day wrote about sensitive topics and addresses them with sensitivity and finesse.<br /><br />I can't stop thinking about this book, the characters, and the story. Day wrote everything perfectly, definitely making Bared to You one of my favorite reads for this year. There was everything in this story, and everything that I didn't think to ask for. By the way, just in case you didn't understand from my vague erotica descriptions, Bared to You contains explicit scenes and is full of hot, graphic sex. But I'm sure you'll enjoy it. I did.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: Berkley/Penguin provided me with a copy of Bared to You.  No goody bags, sponsorships, \\"material connections,\\" or bribes were exchanged for my review.moments shared between Gideon and Eva show the reader this deep understanding of who he really is.

B006RUJST6|5.0|Love this book! It is so full of emotions, and pulls you right in. The story flows well with great connection to the characters. It is a great romance story, that is not like any other book that I have come across, and will leave you feeling slammed with emotion!
B002H3T3TM|3.0|I bought this disc expecting a concert but instead got a blu ray of the events leading up to the concert with a few concert tracks thrown in. This is a good watch as long as you know what you're expecting. This is not a concert. It does have several songs from the Madison Square Garden concert but it's mostly about the build-up to the concert. If that's what you're expecting, then it's great.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I like this DVD and feel that I can use within a regular practice...eventually. I have not taken a belly-dance class in my life so I do not know how to do the basics. I don't know how to properly shimmy, rib slide, hip drop, etc... This DVD is for people who know how to do all those things. Perhaps, it's me. Perhaps, I was a bit over-zealous to think that I could learn tribal fusion belly-dance without any knowledge of the belly-dance basics. I have no prior dance experience and I'm not a trained dancer in other forms at all. Maybe that plays a part in why I cannot catch on to the lessons as quickly. In my opinion, a person should have good body control and overall awareness before attempting to use this DVD. Buy it as the end goal in mind. Buy it so you have something to work towards. That's my suggestion because that is how I intend to use it.
B003N9ASEI|5.0|I'll keep this short. This is one of the greatest movies of all time in a format that makes the movie seems to come alive even more when you're watching it. There is no reason to buy this movie in dvd format if you have a blu ray player. Stop hesitating and just hit add to cart. You'll find it worth it.
B004LROMWU|4.0|Enjoyed the First Season, great story line and plot twists. I cannot wait until Season Two arrives, to follow the exploits of these characters.
0345803485|5.0|I really liked this book not because it was know for it adult erotic content but because it is a great love story.  The male person really changes his life around because he truly loves this woman.  She also learns about herself and matures.  I overlooked the erotic content and really admired the love story part of this novel. I have read the second and third books and it just gets better.  Would love to see this saga made into a movie with the stars that played in the twlight saga as the main charaters.  A must read for the adult person.
B0076I624W|5.0|This is a great movie, as always Anthony Hopkins is awesome!  I recommend this movie to everyone and am glad that I purchased it.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|The reviewers said this movie was a waist of time.<br />They were wronge very wrong...<br />Don't listen to the opinion of someone you don't even know to decide to see something. Form your own opinions...<br /><br />Bottom line, I almost didn't see this movie but I had some free time so decided to give it a try.<br />I am glad I did.<br />If you live the music of the eighties like Journey you probably will like this Movie!<br /><br />I loved this movie! I loved the music and I left happy.<br />It's one of those movies that entertains, it's an escape, it's fun.<br />I can see a bit of Glee in it, a bit of Across the Universe, A bit of of The Beatles Love CD<br /><br />It is a musical like a<br />Across the universe was, not ac creative visual wise as Across the Universe, but music wise, more creative, they blended quite a few songs combining two different songs together in a beautiful new combined creation.<br /><br />I was amazed that all the Actors sang, Alec Baldwin singing? He did in this movie and he interestingly pulled it off as the other actors did to, even some of the minor actors sing, such as unrecognized actors playing a body guard roles.<br /><br />The previews for this movie are combined in ways that are not reflective of the movie...<br />You will know what I mean when you see the move.<br /><br />Look for a didactic lesson in what is Stacy Jacks lesson on the meaning of the World as he knows it!<br /><br />Anyway 5/5 stars for me for uniqueness and entertaining me.<br /><br />Also plan on getting the sound track for this movie, you will want it after seeing the movie.<br /><br />Amazon has the Mp3 download for the whole movie 20 songs for $3.00 a bargain, the CD is $17 at Target!
B004XIZN5M|5.0|The book gives a logical progression through the \\"big six\\" bodyweight exercises. There are ten exercises in each progression, designed to take you from the lowest level of each (for example pushing off a wall) to the highest level (a one armed pushup).<br /><br />Packed with tips, tricks, and other useful information. Well worth the investment.
B005HS00XW|2.0|I was somewhat disappointed...<br /><br />Somewhat old fashioned, I was much more impressed with Mr.Gabriel's<br />album \\"Secret World Live\\" [2003].<br /><br />Both were good, but still preferred the former.<br /><br />TFS
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Umm...I don't wanna be \\"that guy\\", you know, the guy who insists that a movie exactly follow the book, or fairy tale, from wich it was drawn, but still: isn't Snow White supposed to be PRETTIER than the evil witch?

0895772779|5.0|I have been a longtime fan of Doyle's works, as I love the era they take place in and his style of writing. I actually picked up the Reader's Digest edition of \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes.\\" I liked the design of it a lot; it looks like a book Holmes himself would keep on his shelf. I then decided to order the Adventures and the Memoirs off of Amazon. They are great, and they look nice on my shelf next to my beat up paperback copies.<br />I also liked the pamphlet included behind the endpaper, giving some of the history of the author. I am afraid that I have started using it as a bookmark, however.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun when u start playing it you get addicted to it and cant stop playing it.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|It seems people go rabid at the mention of in app purchases.  The app description is very clear and states in the first line extra money can be spent.  that said, I haven't had to spend a penny.  The game is a pretty straight forward tower defense with some resourse gathering thrown in for good measure.  If you get stuck grinding it out for upgrades, try survival mode.  You can earn money much quicker there.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game couldn't stop playing since I started it must run fast before the monkeys chases you and eats you up great game
B0024FA9IM|5.0|I am person alone most of the time but this is a film that I can watch over and over.  It has great special effects, some good action and a wonderful family story.  It certainly has some plot weaknesses but all the good guys survive and even a bad one.  The family life is refreshingly normal.  It is fun and the whole PG family can watch it.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|Beautiful disaster is very reminiscent of the 50 shades series but played down a lot.  The intesnse relationship between a good girl and a very bad boy that noone else has been able to reign in until now.  Oh but she has a secret past that she is desperately trying to escape from that is frankly a little unbelievable , undeveloped and underwritten and falls short of what could be interesting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book as I read the first two in the series. I would like to see the series continued. It would like to read more about the love story between the Christian and Anastasia. More of an adult book. Same amount of \\"adult content\\" as the first two.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I think this book is better written than book one. Some of our mysteries are not solved right away whereas book one you get answers really quickly. The new characters added make it more interesting and keep my attention. I like that it switches between Ky's POV and Cassia's POV. It's nice to see from both views. The main part of the story is a long journey across a desert and deserted village, low on food and water, finding graves and secret tunnels, a map to the Rising, and a HUGE secret that Xander has been keeping from Cassia comes out.<br />The struggle Ky and Cassia go through to find each other is amazing. Not a single boring part to the story.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app downloads YouTube videos to your device. It is nice because my mom can download instructional videos for DYI projects. You can download them and take them with you when wifi is unavailable. Really convenient.

B00847TKSE|5.0|I really liked this movie, especially because it was a true story!  I also liked that there was a lot of news and how many people cared.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|This book did have a great beginning and ending but the middle was like a stalkers dream.  Throughout the whole book the 2 main characters either faught or stalked each other.  This is also not a book for teens.
B007Y2W44W|5.0|First: The sound. This disc is state of the art. Absent is the over-compressed, heavily distorted, and lifeless sound of nearly all modern pop/rock/metal CDs. There is a transparent quality to the sound that demands some top-notch headphones to fully appreciate. This disc shows that digital releases can sound better than analog (LPs). Hopefully other artists/engineers will follow suit with discs that sound this great.<br />Second: The music. Nile is still at the height of their powers here. Varied, crushing, exciting death metal throughout this album. The vocal variation has never been greater and I love it. The riffs are as great as ever. Thank you Nile!
B003G4W49C|5.0|My mind is so blown right now I can't even write this review.  I don't even know how to start.  I can only think of one word to descride this book, wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow! This book was absoulutely amazing.  I can not put it in words.  This book is everything I could have asked for, action, adventure, and much more.  Throughout the whole book, I felt as if I could relate to Ender, what he thought,  what he felt, and just everything he went through.  I felt sorry for him and some points also.  Sometimes I was happy for him, but at other times I was sad.  I don't know what else to say about this book. Again, just wow.  When I finished, I just sat there in awe for a few minutes. That's how great this book was.  I am definetely going to read the rest of the series.  Now they are making a movie that is going to be released on November 1, 2013, and I can't even think how epic the movie is going to be.  I hope Ender's Game will always be a classic for years to come.  And I think the ending will surprise you, it definetely surprised me!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|So far I play this game just so I can beat my previous time. So far I'm at two minutes.
0525478817|5.0|This novel is just flawless. I couldn't put it down. The author's use of ideas and phrases so relevant to the average person just blew me away. I wanted to write down so many brilliant quotes. You become attached to the characters. I cried so many times during this book, just because the characters meant so much to me, even though I read the book in three days. It's worth your time. It is a positively brilliant novel.
0060558121|5.0|American Gods was an excellent read in every way.<br />Often I felt myself bothered by certain aspects of the novel only to find that the problems I had with it were essential plot points written in such a way for powerful impacts.<br />The characters - humans, gods, demigods, and folk-heroes alike - interact in such simultaneously connected and disparate ways that a reader is able to lose themselves completely in one plot line, but effortlessly switch to another perspective after yet another heart-stopping plot twist.<br />This is just my opinion, but if I were to choose one word for this novel, it would be \\"uncomfortable.\\" Gaiman here has written something with such an air of familiarity for all characters and subjects that a reader cannot even begin to cast a negative judgement on the contents of the novel because he/she picks up on Gaiman's connection to the work so deeply.<br />Every part of this novel has a flip side or twist, and if you choose to read it, prepare to be unsettled the entire way through.
0307474275|5.0|The book is in excellent condition, and the seller delivered the item in a timely fashion.  I actually had read the story once, and this is my 2nd time to read the story.  If you haven't read \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" then don't miss out this great work of Dan Brown's.

B0040JHXTI|5.0|After setting the rock world on fire with 1975's \\"Born to Run,\\" Bruce Springsteen spent the next three years involved a professionally, financially and emotionally taxing legal battle with his former manager, Mike Appell. The lawsuit prevented him from releasing any new recordings during this time, threatening his relevance and staying power as performer with the general public. It also motivated him into the most prolific songwriting period of his career; Springsteen wrote over 70 songs during this time, raging from lighweight 1960s' inspired pop songs to soul crushing ballads about loss and defeat. By May of 1978, Springsteen finally had a record ready to cement that he wasn't just a flash in the pan: \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\\"<br /><br />\\"Darkness\\" continues many of the themes of present in \\"Born to Run,\\" but takes that previous record's youthful abandon and optimism and twists a blade in it. Whereas the open road in tracks like \\"Thunder Road\\" and \\"Night\\" were never ending pathways to freedom and excitement, here on songs like the aching \\"Something in the Night,\\" the gorgeously melancholy \\"Racing in the Street\\" (a beloved epic in the same vein as \\"Backstreets\\" and \\"Jungleland\\" with Roy Bittan at the top of his game) and the raging \\"Streets of Fire,\\" it's a journey to nowhere littered with broken dreams, betrayal and ultimately defeat. The youthful, naive romantic view of love begging Mary to climb in has given way to the raw, raging lust of \\"Candy's Room\\" and the last chance promise of \\"Prove It All Night.\\" Optimism and defiance still hold a place in this world, as present on \\"Badlands\\" (probably Springsteen's best live anthem) and \\"The Promised Land.\\" Springsteen also gets in touch with his daddy issues on the fiery \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\" and the pensive \\"Factory.\\" The record's closing title track sums up all of these themes: the narrator stands defeated, but still willing to live with his mistakes and take a stand.<br /><br />\\"Darkness\\" is one of Springsteen's most beloved records and is held in extremely high regards by his fanbase. After the anniversary boxed set for \\"Born to Run\\" was released in 1975, fans were hoping it would get a similar treatment. After several delays, our hopes and prayers were finally answered in November 2010.<br /><br />\\"The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story\\" boasts 3 cds and 3 dvds filled with rare outtakes, a gorgeous booklet, and never before seen footage spanning over 30 years. The original 1978 record has been remastered, which is still a big deal despite all the other goodies thrown in: the original release was probably Springsteen's worst sounding record - flat sounding, lacking any punch or dynamic to the instruments or vocals. The new remaster isn't perfect but is a vast improvement: the record now explodes out of the speakers with much more clarity.<br /><br />Augmenting the original record is the two cd set, \\"The Promise.\\" This set compiles several outtakes from this period that reveal the depth and diversity of Springsteen as a songwriter. Some of these tracks, namely \\"Fire\\" and \\"Because the Night,\\" were huge hits for other artists and remain live staples in Bruce's shows over the years (unfortunately neither of the studio takes here match the intensity of their various live performances). Bruce the pop songwriter is largely present here as opposed to the deep thinking working man's rocker: \\"Gotta Get that Feeling,\\" \\"Wrong Side of the Street,\\" \\"Rendezvous,\\" \\"Save My Love,\\" \\"Ain't Good Enough for You,\\" and \\"Talk to Me\\" are all masterclasses in three minute op songwriting: great hooks, catchy arrangements, and a lot of fun. We get some early sketches of other songs as well, including a tougher, less pensive \\"Racing in the Street\\" with alternate lyrics, the mellow \\"Candy's Boy,\\" and the bland early \\"Factory\\" draft \\"Come On (Let's Go Tonight).\\" There are some misfires that should've been left in the can (\\"It's a Shame,\\" \\"Spanish Eyes,\\" \\"Breakaway,\\"), but then you have to marvel at how a song as great as \\"The Promise\\" was somehow left in the vaults when it truly is among the very best songs he has ever wrote.<br /><br />The dvds are truly special. The first is from late 2010, when Bruce gathered the E Street Band members who recorded on the original record (plus the dearly departed Danny Federici's replacement, Charlie Giordano) into the empty Boardwalk Hall for a brand new recording of the album. It is a simply stunning performance, and in some ways it's an even stronger set of songs than the original records, taking on much of the added energy of a traditional live performance without an audience present. The higlight is the 1-2 punch of \\"Streets of Fire\\" and \\"Prove It All Night\\" (the best versions of either song in recent years), which has Bruce attacking his guitar solos with a reckless abandon that has not been seen much in recent years.<br /><br />The documentary, \\"The Promise,\\" is a more dramatic tale than \\"Born to Run's\\" \\"Wings for Wheels,\\" and features excellent interviews from all major contributors, including deeply missed blood brothers Danny and Clarence. We also get a rare look inside the studio, with various rough cuts and goofing around caught on tape (seeing Bruce and Steve laughing their way to an early draft of \\"Sherry Darling\\" is sublime).<br /><br />The live dvd from December 8th, 1978, in Houston is probably the most anticipated and exciting inclusion in this set. For years, fans have been hoping for an official live release from the Darkness tour, largely considered to be Springsteen's best tour ever and the one that cemented his reputation for marathon shows with never ending energy. The show is three pure hours pure rock and roll. Some people have bemoaned the sound and picture quality as it is taken directly from the house camera, but it does little if anything to deter the excitement of the show itself. The band powers their way through every song as if their lives depend on it, be it a rocker or a slow burner. The energy never lets up. Amazingly, they're still near this level today.<br /><br />This boxed set is a must for all Springsteen fans, and should be purchased immediately.o marvel at how a song as great as \\"The Promise\\" was somehow left in the vaults when it truly is among the very best songs he has ever wrote.<br /><br />The dvds are truly special.

B007XH6BPG|5.0|i think this is a super group, excellent record. They should write another album and make tours,congrats Steve and Chris, i give my vote to it
B005KR6OBM|4.0|It's a pretty good series, and I'd missed a lot of the episodes... but I wish the distributor or whoever had found a way to remove the laugh track. It's very annoying to watch 4 or 5 episodes in one sitting, because of the inane laughter in the background. In fact, I don't know WHY there are still laugh tracks around. In a way, it's an insult to the viewer's intelligence.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I found myself struggling to read Gone Girl in the first half of the book. It was hard work for me, for three reasons:<br /><br />1. Written in first person. For some reason, I usually find novels written in first person to require more effort.<br /><br />2. Two narrators. Flynn alternates narrators every chapter. Different personalities, different voices. Multiply the first person issue times two.<br /><br />3. Unreliable narrator. The narrators seem to be telling opposite sides of the same story, but they can't be--something's not quite right. Somebody might be trying to pull the wool over our eyes. But which one?<br /><br />This makes the first half of the book unsettling. What's going on here?<br /><br />But hang on. Around the halfway point, things become a bit more clear, and then it's a race to the finish.<br /><br />Flynn's writing gives her characters fresh, outspoken personalities and dialog that sparkles. The dynamics of the relationships are very intense.<br /><br />So if you're thinking about reading this book, I encourage you to dive in. Don't give up during the first half. It takes some work, but it's worth it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I loved Part One of this book. The last two parts are terrible. I recommended this to my friend until I finished it then told her she should not waste her money.

1442419814|4.0|Fantastic dystopian story that had me from the first chapter. I can't imagine living in a world such as Tally's where you get a pretty operation at 16 and and you get to go live with the pretties. I mean I would really hate living in that kind of world because what one perceives as pretty is not always anothers opinion and Tally soon comes to the conclusion that the dream she has had for so long of becoming a pretty may just be a nightmare instead. I rooted for her 100% when she rebels and takes off to find her friend Shay and to discover what is beyond.... Well actually she wasn't given much choice in the matter at first as she was given the choice of giving up her friends location or never being able to become pretty which at the time was what Tally thought she wanted...it was only later she came to see that things were not all as they appeared.

B0008ENIAC|4.0|Apparently the urge to overindulge one's children is not solely a recurring phenomenon of the \\"baby-boomer\\" generations. And just as apparently the object of those 1940s indulgences were, as in the film under review Mildred Pierce, just as ungrateful as the children of today's baby-boomers. At least in fiction just in case one of those current objects stumbles on to this review.<br /><br />Now the name of high- end steamy pot-boiler novelist  James M. Cain is well-known to this writer. His classic Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice (and their film adaptations) have been fulsomely reviewed in this space. But here is the twist in Mildred Pierce. While saucy housewife waiting to break out from stifling suburban existence (1940s California suburban, there is a difference), that self-same Mildred Pierce (played by Joan Crawford) of the title, has her own qualifications for femme fatale-dom in a demure way the real femme here is strictly junior varsity, her daughter, Veda (played kittenishly by Ann Blyth). So it was a little disconcerting, after having seen the likes of Miss Cora (played by Lana Turner) in Postman and Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity twist their men around so badly that they could not see straight and came back for more, and gladly, to see this junior varsity edition at work. But not for long.<br /><br />I better lay out the drift of story and you will see what I mean. California suburban housewife and devoted mother Mildred, up from poverty, or close to it, wanted to give her two daughters (although only Veda counts) what she didn't have. Fair enough. But apparently something got messed up in the Pierce gene pool or in any social or moral sensibilities as they passed to Veda. Veda, no matter what, wanted more and everything. Well Papa Pierce fell on hard times (and was doing a little two-timing as well) and the Pierces decided to divorce. Mildred decided, very unconventionally for the times, to open a restaurant to keep the wolves from the door (and keep Veda in things, many things, ungratefully accepted). Part of that process was to get backing, and a few breaks. The backing comes from Wally (a money mad real estate deal maker) and the breaks from Monte, scion to a descending family fortune but still capable of putting on the high society faux charm for Mildred (and Veda).<br /><br />The whole mix, the whole class mix, was wrong though, and because this is a crime film noir something bad had to happen. And the callous and very class-conscious Monte was the fall guy, a very dead fall guy with about six slugs in him. As the film unwinds backwards to find out who did the dastardly deed  about five different candidates emerge, including Mildred, ready to fall on their swords to protect someone. That someone of course being Veda who when Monte threw her over got, uh, a little high strung and wasted the poor guy. As always though in crime noir truth and justice will win out and Veda had to take her fall and will have many a lonely night to think over her errors in some dank California women's prison far from the bright lights of Los Angeles night clubs. Hey, nobody said every femme fatale, junior edition, was going made it to the \\"bigs.\\"<br /><br />P.S. I don't  know about you but after watching some of these Cain film adaptations and a few other crime noir gems like Jane Greer in Out Of The Past and Rita Hayworth  in The Lady From Shang-hai somebody should take these femmes aside and give them a little instruction in shooting with guns. They all seem, and maybe it is because they are a little nervous or agitated, to feel the need to pump about six slugs in every guy that has wronged them. Terrible waste of ammo, terrible, although like I said maybe they were just the slightest bit angry at the time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am in love with the Fifty Shades Trilogy!! It took me in and I didn't want to let go. Christian is so hot to me! I wish he was a real man! These are the best books and I definitly recommend them to anyone!!!!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|fantastic app. great options and easy to use. worth the small price. use it on lot of pictures old and new
B00846REIS|4.0|I finshed reading Fifty Shades serious twice and wanted something similar. After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. It took a while for me to really get into the story, I would say around chapter 2 or so. Once the story progressed I really enjoyed it, and before I knew it the story was over and I have to wait until October to get hooked again. This isn't really a \\"copy cat\\" per say of Fify Shades there are simularities, but if you LOVED Fify like I so did you will enjoy this book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I alike the game it puts a good twist to the Oregon Trail when I was a kid. the game play is a little hard to get into in the beginning but it gets easier.
B001NYPTO4|2.0|Potential buyers should note that this is \\"Music from...\\", not a soundtrack per se. This is an important distinction, because if you loved the 2001 movie and want to relive the excitement you will find this an unworthy addition to your collection. Some of the orchestral numbers are here, yes, but some of the earlier songs switch performers from the movie cast. David Bowie is nice, but I want to hear John Leguizamo (Toulouse) perform \\"Nature Boy.\\" The omission of the \\"Like a Virgin\\" cover in particular is almost criminal. What we get in return are remixed style covers and cuts that were not in the original film.<br /><br />Be certain that this is what you want before you buy. If you want the movie experience, you may be better looking elsewhere.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|Its a good movie to watch, very entertaining. If your into sci fi this is a good one for you because its not so futuristic but it does have robots.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Can't believe I wasted my money on this book.  Ms. Steele is probably one of the most annoying characters I have every read.  First book was okay but her constant complaining in this one has worn me out.  My advice is to not get suckered into buying this cheesy book.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is fun and challenging.  Great way to keep your brain working over the summer.  There are many levels so it keeps the game challenging.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is truly  an addictive game that can't be put down!!!! Temple Run is a game that does not get old!!
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a great game and I only wish their was more surprises because it has lots of repartition.<br />still good.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|This app does its job, especially on my Transformer Tab.  It has some refresh issues on the Kindle Fire, and I am not 100% happy with the synch feature between Google Tasks and the widget.  You definitely have to make sure you refresh to get the current due date of your tasks and make sure you have the most up-to-date list.  That being said, it was a decent app.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This is the first time I have reviewed a book. I have too much time on my hands and tend to go through a lot of books. Lately I have decided to only buy kindle books that are under $5. Obviously, I have gone through a lot of dogs and some I couldn't even trudge through and just gave up. I sometimes want to write reviews about these terrible books but I feel bad for the author and feel that since they are cheep let buyers fend for themselves. I have read many Grisham novels and have enjoyed them all. I purchased this book hurriedly before a trip and broke my $5 rule because I knew I could count on Mr. Grisham to deliver a good read. I am giving this book four stars because it was exactly what I wanted to read after so many poorly written books. It might not be the best Grisham book or even the best book I have read in this year, but it was thoroughly enjoyable to the finish. Great character developemnet is what this author does best and the flow is smooth and seemless. I look forward to finding some good deals on Grisham books I have not yet read.

B004I11VZ0|5.0|Hey you all. I must Start out on saying that this movie is great no question asked. I enjoy it every single time i get the chance to watch it.<br /><br />Regards.
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|Meryl Streep is a badass, will always be one.  This is given but seeing her in this role the way she did it was like seeing \\"The Doors\\", or \\"Ray\\" or \\"J. Edgar\\" or \\"Elizabeth\\".  Yo felt like you were seeing history and learning more the you knew or at least getting more interested in the history behind the story.  I noticed that some people did not like this movie as much as I did but I found Meryl Streep blinding in her performance.
1932100660|5.0|This is by far the best book on nutrition that I have seen.  Dr. Campbell breaks down how food affects overall health.  I would recommend this book to everyone.  A truly remarkable study.
B005LAII1C|1.0|For a movie that has no story and is just about a guy getting trashed with his teddy bear, it should have been 30 min. This should have just been a made for TV Family Guy special so people would not have to waste $12 for this film.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|great movie. great packaging from seller, and i dont know what else to say really other than its a fantastic family movie and you will be watching it over and over!
1401937519|5.0|Dying to Be Me; by Anita Moonjani has been a confirmation for me and my husband of what we have always thought and also hoped to be true about energy, life, our spiritual essence; whether alive or after we leave our bodies. Her recounting her life before, during and after her illness and death are documented and authentic.  Great gift to us all.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of variety. some games are boring but most of them are a fun way to pass time. includes easy games for children and some challenging ones for adults too
B007PTJOV0|1.0|this game some shizz who wants a tucking lepracaun this is a copy of Mario this is the whizzed that is green with blood spots on it that make ur butt hurt this got me mad as shizz
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Everybody's pretty much covered it all about 11/22/63, but I was riveted from beginning to end and cannot wait for the casting of the movie to be released.  I only hope that Demme can do the book justice.  This is, for me, the best Stephen King book I've ever read.  It has everything going for it and your mind can absolutely go to another place for a while and have a bit of trouble readjusting when you put it down, which you won't be able to do very often, until it ends.  It might take two read-throughs to get all the nuances, tho, so I'm going to rest a bit and then go back and read it again.  I can't remember the last time I did that with a book.  Great job, Mr. King!
0525478817|5.0|This book has to be read. Incredible, powerful, astonishing, fantastic. All of the right adjectives describe it. You must read it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this organized and yet so customizable way of reading the Bible. I wish there were more translations, though :)
1568363850|5.0|I have used the Japaense For Busy People series for a long time and each revision gets better. I highly reccommend this book for a quick study of the Japanese language.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't like the story. There is too much hype on this book. I'm sure there are better written sex books out there. I felt like I was reading Twilight.
0312330537|1.0|this book is in poor shape. it's a gift for someone and it's not presentable. i cannot recommend this company
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game.it always is my go to when I am bored.I have every game and the harder ones to get are the best
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The book had the usual suspense and thrill of a David Balducci book.  It was an intriguing plot with plenty of twists with the characters.  I was motivated to read the book each day until I finished.  The only disappointment was the ending.  It was more predictable than most other Balducci books.  Regardless, I would recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is a perfect time waster and works great  on my kindle fire. but some of the games are a little bit difficult
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A fun game to play when waiting for other stuff in life.  I like the building of stuff an<br />d the multiple items needed to make bigger items.
B0067R0APK|5.0|The best.  Works well keeps multi  cities has alerted me about multi issues.  Down load this app.  Love it love it love
3836528347|3.0|Taschen usually publishes books of a very high standard of production. The images in this book often lack clear resolution. Also, the selection of images used at times seems questionable, for example leaving out ads the Nash Rambler, a iconic car, and certain other iconic products and innovations of the era.<br /><br />The title alone hints at the hype factor. These ads could stand on their own without piggybacking on the success of a TV show. All in all, at Amazon;s excellent price, it's an OK book, but I couldn;t go further than that. The ads of this era were artful, and are a very appealing subject for study. This book doesn;t come close to doing them justice.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Liam Neeson is awesome but the movie is dark and depressing.  Not a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  Fairly predictable. won't watch it again or recommend it.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I really love the new twist on Angry Birds! Kindle Fire users...hold your horses and quit your whining. Really? You're going to give an app a one star review because they don't have a free version ready on the marketplace for you yet? WOW! Grow up and review an app for what it is, not because you feel left out! Sheesh!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|why do you have to log in? it upsets me a lot .it's just not for me. I hate to log in!
B000N2HCM4|1.0|I admit I tend to be conservative.  I have not cared for Obama's first four years.  I am not a Mitt fan.  I have read so many Facebook pages about Obama being a racist, etc, but did not want to form an opinion until I had read his book.  Well, I am dumbfounded that we, as Americans (you can be white, yellow, orange, black or brown, but once you can vote, you are a US citizen!)voted this bigot into office.  I was dumbfounded about how racist his views are.  Further, given that his grandparents who raised him are Caucasian, I would expect him to be more open minded.<br />As a \\"read\\", this book has nothing to say.......  I believe this writer is so intent on using \\"big words\\" that he fails to convey a useful message of any kind.  I am intelligent, and benefitted from attending some of the best and most prestigious schools in the USA, but I could not follow many of this man's thoughts/statements until I read them several times over.  Once I had expended that effort, I realized (repeatedly) that the writer was only trying to impress by using uncommonly used words.  What a crock.<br />I can appreciate that Mr. Obama missed hisAfrican roots and wanted to explore them....it is his heritage.  I even applaud his determination.  However, I can't respect a man who has such a closed mind concerning race relations, and who has not worked a day outside of \\"government\\" work.  Work in the private sector.  Work for the good of ALL people.... Then come talk to me.  Until then, almost sadly, I have no choice but to support the ultra annoying Mitt.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|So happy to have seen this.  I write for a living but, for me, the experience of seeing Pink Floyd create is beyond words.  Those of you who have similar experiences will know that I mean I listened and looked in awe.
B004WR125O|5.0|Worked immediately with my Onkyo nr-609. Came brand new in the original box. Small in size and looks stylish with the receiver. I'm happy with the product.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love this thing it lets you pretty much do anything as an editor. Touch up a photo, make it silly, whatever you can imagine!! 5 Stars
B005KMX866|5.0|The is a great CD of Sun covers by Chris Isaak. I first saw this live on a public television special. This is great stuff. Highly recommend. If you enjoy the Sun records catalog, you will like thi.
0545265355|5.0|the boxed set was in perfect shape after shipping and looked great.My Brother was very happy when he recieved it and it looked like it cost alot of money but was resonable priced.
B006OFN0SE|4.0|I don't know the first thing about directing, but I wasn't surprised when the credits rolled and it said directed by Clint Eastwood. Most of the great American movies I've seen l lately that leave me with a satisfied desire to know more have been his work. I am not much of a groupie, but I think I'm turning into a fan and will start looking for his work.<br /><br />Di Caprio has proven that he can still act, and what a joy it is to see that again. He guy's got talent. I am not sure if he just tends to pick the wrong vehicles or like anyone he has good days and bad days, but he is marvelously \\"on\\" in this film. The make-up is incredible! His transformation into an old, beastly, gay man is remarkable. When I see people playing other famous people, it's sometimes difficult not to see the actor instead of the character. I believed the entire time that I was looking at J. Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />I felt the story was complete. It gave a lot of historical background to make things make sense. The family scenes, dating scenes, cases and social scenes fleshed out J. Edgar and gave insight into his motivation, his personality and what it might have been like to be him or work closely with him. He was one disturbed guy, but what a fascinating peek into that world!<br /><br />I loved the film and would recommend it to anyone interested in history or biographies. If you are into action, car crashes, explosions, and T&A, this probably isn't for you. There's no sex, nudity, foul language or anything like that. There's just life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. You are able to visualize the characters well and the steaminess of the sexual encounters made for some great dialogue with my Husband. I will say that sometimes the descriptions of the scenes becomes repetitive. And I found it odd that each time a character was African American the book would specifically point out their race. Fifty Shades is definitely a page turner that I finished in 2 days and I bought the next book in the trilogy soon after.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|Touching, sometimes funny, sometimes sad. I really enjoyed seeing the real newscasts from the event. Brokaw, Jennings, Rather. And, what a hoot, the future governor of Alaska. And wonderful to see so many different people coming together for these incredible creatures. Too bad we can't all do that for everything.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book answers a lot of questions from book one and also shows Anastasia going deeper down the rabbit hole. You also see Christian get a heart and Anastasia get a spine. I enjoyed Book Two, not as much as book 1 but I enjoyed it none the less.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|My husband read the book and we have been watching the movie as a family.  Our 11 year old is actually excited about watching it and even bought the soundtrack.  The film is approachable for children, though the language occasionally requires interpretation and there are some gory scenes, i.e. people with the pox and surgery.  I think it does a good job of bringing history alive for kids and adults.  It has motivated us to try other historical movies to encourage an interest in history.
B004P8ITGU|5.0|As you settle into the first pages you loose yourself in the life and happenings of the Boone family. Like the joy of returning to a comfortable chair after a hectic day you join Theodore as his latest experience unfolds
B004LWZW9C|3.0|This movie is cute following in the footsteps of Valentine's Day and Love Actually in an all star case with intertwined stories.  However, do not buy this if you want to watch it through itunes and your Apple device.  The ultraviolet copy will not load into this software and you have paid for something you must use another app for.
B007Y2W44W|1.0|people im a huge nile fan , and has been for years !!! But are you all smoking CRACK this shit is awful and terriable there is nothing good about this cd HAVE YOU EVER HEARD NILE PREVIOUS TO THIS !!!!THEY USE TO KICKASS
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love it and all but I hate it when it doesn't let me play the free version at all it keeps going to buy full version or buy update PLEASE FIX IT.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game because its almost like the one on fb but it takes three mins. for one slice of energy!!!
0061478784|4.0|This was a book for all ages that enjoy a good fantasy. It was never dragging and had lots of fun tongue and cheek and you could really relate to Sophie [both young and old Sophie] It is a book that I will pass on to my Grandkids.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  it reminds me of another very popular game of my youth.  its fun and easy to navigate. even my four year old can play it.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Thrilling guitar! (albeit electric, still great guitar, and he's clearly a Gibson guy). Great blues, and I like Joe's voice. And Rick Melick is wonderful on piano. John Hyatt is superb guest guitarist, especially on a number called \\"Down Around My Place.\\" Tal Bergman is fabulous on drums . Beth Hart is a guest blues singer on two songs and really belts 'em out. This concert ran as a fundraiser for public TV in Philadelphia. I donated to station AND bought the DVD set. Joe, Joe . . . you touch my soul!
B00006RCNW|5.0|Bought as a gift for a fan of the show. They loved it! So if you are a fan I recommend it!
B0001932ZA|5.0|What a great movie, Arnold didn't disappoint. Picture quality was great for a remastered movie from the 80s. I highly recommend.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Bought as a gift for a fan of David Cook. They loved it! So if you are a fan I recommend it!
B002962RKE|1.0|Though I have not really seen very many full episodes of this program before, the ones that I have seen have bored me out of my mind. The plots are awfully dull, even though I do enjoy the music a lot of times. The performers are fantastic at singing and I enjoy many of the songs that they have covered, but the plots of the episodes are awfully bland to me. Other people might think differently, but that is just my opinion. I like the singing; just not the series itself.
0060254920|5.0|I bought for my grandson because it was on of my daughters favorite books.  Highly recommend this book to everyone!
0525425578|5.0|Another great Grisham book. I love his adult books amd these books for kids are awesome too!  I read them all.<br /><br />Mjr
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It is very well written and leaves you wanting more. I would and did recommend this book to a friend. I personally can not wait for Ms. James to write more books. She is a wonderful author and really knows how to draw you in to her story.
B000VIWGTE|5.0|Finally got with the program and started listen to Pandora.  I created a channel adding bands like Nightwish, Xandria, Edenbridge, Stream of Passion, etc....<br />Heard this band and gave thumbs up and saved the song title.  Finally bought the mp3 cd and wow!  I really love this band.  The singer's voice is incredible and the dude playing guitar really knows what he's doing.  I play myself so I can appreciate guitar players that play with purpose.  The guitar sounds are superb and fits so nicely with each song.  This is what you call a truly mature band that understands music and how its suppose to be.<br />Great, great band and I'll be buying a lot more of The Gathering.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I LOVED this book and did not want it to end. I can't wait for Ms. James to write more books. I will be one of the first in line to buy any book by Ms. James. I would recommend to read the whole book from cover to cover, you don't want to miss anything. Ms. James keeps you on the edge of your seat with all of the events involving Jack Hyde and Christian's never ending \\"fifty shades\\". I will read all the books again and again. Thank goodness I have a Kindle because I could only imagaine what a paperback copy would look after being read so much.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I love Sherlock Holmes!  And the fact I can have all the series for such a low price makes it that much better.  Thanks!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I would and did recommend this book to any friend that I thought would enjoy it. I felt like I could not get enough, I did not want to put it down.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is one game that I don't want to put down. Game has great graphic. Easy to follow instructions. A must have game.
B007PS0X0W|4.0|It was good, I suggest watching this movie at least once. Even if your not a fan of the others.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|this book sounds like it's for people who need a book to get off. to each his own, but i feel lucky that i don't.
B007Z9R69M|1.0|Men's Fitness magazine lauded this movie and I was excited to see it. Almost from the start, it was slow, herky-jerky, and boring.  It is very rare for me to fall asleep during a movie, but I cannot remember the ending to this one as I dipped in and out of snoozeville.
0425263908|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I've ever read. It's akin to Fifty Shades of Grey, but so much better written-you can really enjoy the story without groaning at the constant repeating of words or phrases as found in Fifty. The sex is very steamy, and the characters and their antics are just wonderful to read. This is the first book I ever re-read in my life. I just enjoyed it so much, I was so sorry to see it end, I finished it, and immediately started all over again. Needless to say, I am very anxiously awaiting the next installment to be released in October.
0446572993|5.0|After I finished this book I began to think about some of the inconsistencies of the story.  However, when I was reading it I did not pay attention to them.  I just wanted to continue the pages.  Also thrillers are based on characters as well as stories.  Julie and Robie were just a great team.  I think Julie was one of the best characters in a book of this sort I have met in years.  I do not know how he will do it but I hope Baldacci finds a way to write a follow up.
0307913090|5.0|It's dark, suspenseful, powerful, haunting (yeah, i said it), and pure genius.  GRRM deserves to be thanked by everyone for creating such a fine piece of work that will be cherished for a very long time, right up there with Tolkien.  I can agree with some peoples' dislikes for it, but I honestly believe their dislikes are what make GRRM such a great author.  His writing brings out emotions in you that you never thought you would feel when reading a book.  The first time I tossed a book across the room in anger because something messed up happened to the main character was in Clan of the Cave Bear.  I threw it across the room at the wall, only to get up a minute later (after I had cooled off), pick it back up, and continue reading. The second time was with this story.  But I realized that is what makes great writing: the ability to bring out intense emotions in the reader.<br />This isn't no children's story.  Lots of war, violence, cruelty, rape, etc.  So if you don't like these kinds of things, don't read this story!  Seriously, some of the stories have haunted me.  I get the images stuck in my head and....whooo!  Great writing!<br />I really do wish I had learned of this when it first came out.  Here it is 2012 and I am just now discovering this gem.  Better late than never.<br />And as goes for ROY DOTRICE, he is brilliant.  Some of his voices crack me up and he knows how to pull you into the story.<br />5 STARS!!!
0811821846|4.0|I bought this book for my son to give to my husband, a huge Star Wars fan, as a birthday gift. Both my son and my husband got a kick out of the pictures in the cookbook as well as the titles of the recipes. We haven't had a chance to try any of the recipes yet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Star Wars theme<br />-MANY pictures depicting representing characters with finished product<br />-Recipe titles, such as \\"Wookie Cookies\\" are sure to amuse and bring giggles to the reader<br />-Recipes are simple enough for children to make (with supervision of course)<br />-Ingrediants are mostly inexpensive, easy to find and/or things most people would already have<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Recipes are nothing new, just renamed versions of simple, basic foods<br />-The Star Wars appeal and association to the finished product will be lost with many of the recipes if you don't have similar toys to use as decorations to serve with it.
B007MDB71O|1.0|This is a TERRIBLE movie!  I couldn't even finish it.  There is no plot, the characters are stupid and weakly developed, and it is difficult to follow.  Don't waste your time or money!
B0086700CM|5.0|Just got the game today and almost beat it all. I love the game a lot. It is really awesome.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|blab blab blab blab I don't care I do not want to right a review I'm doing this for points if you want to know about the game download it and play it your self
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey, this book was an okay read.! At times it was very predictable. A lot of review are comparing the book to twilight..... I can't make that connection at all. The end of the book does leave you wanting to get the next installment.... Fifty Shades darker..! The only reason i bought this book was because its the bestseller at the moment but I am glad i got it..!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Happened upon this series while browsing inexpensive Kindle books. From the very first chapter I was stuck like chuck. Completely and utterly obsessed!  I couldn't pull myself away and read it in two days. When I finished Omnibus I went online searching for more and was relieved to find book 6 (I'll review my thoughts on that one separately). Read that straight through in only a few hours. Can't believe I rushed such a good thing! Searched Hugh's webpage looking for book 7 and ugh....only in the beginning stages! I'm squirming in my seat with anticipation. It's been forever since I was so immersed in a series!
6305718954|3.0|In a genre that has been done to death, this movie is a rare prize. The framing premise is a bit trite, but you're past that in the first 5 minutes of the movie, and from there it just keeps building. Solid acting performances by Byrne and Arquette and truly outstanding cinematography make this film one of my favorites. Head-and-shoulders better than much more widely seen movies (The Seventh Sign, for instance) I would rate it four stars but for the somewhat threadbare intro and banal Vatican politics. If you enjoy this genre at all, see this movie. You'll be glad you did.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book was a wonderful find and not at all as I was expecting. I am partial to post  apocalyptic literature, and I am always searching for the next great one. This one goes in the short list of books to recommend. Engaging characters, believable scenarios, and a great tale of how it would be if we were starting all over again with technology but only hidden knowledge. Read it.
0345803485|5.0|Excellent!!!  I am not a reader and I had this 500+ page book read in 5 days.  Immediately ordered book 2 and 3.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I ordered a new copy of Peter Pan.  It had parts that skipped and stuck.  I contacted customer service and they responded immediately.  The product must have been defective.  They issued a full refund right away.  Thanks for handling this so nicely and for a speedy refund.  Highly recommend this seller.
B0041LG08U|5.0|Got this after looking around at a lot of other seikos.  Like the reputation as a durable automatic watch, and the styling of this one is a bit more dressy than some.  Very happy with it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Wonderful book. It is well written and an overall GREAT book! If there were more stars to give I would give more. I can't wait for the Travis' brothers books to come out.

1609611543|5.0|Read this book at the recommendation of my Cardiologist!  After three days of following this diet, I started feeling great!  The author of this book is very convincing discussing the health problems of hybridized wheat and sugar.  It is worth reading if you are fatigued, gaining weight, have diabetes, have problems with mental fogginess after eating, or bloating with stomach issues, even if you do not believe you are gluten sensitive.  The research is great motivation, but following the diet helps the reader eliminate wheat and sugar and many health problems improve!
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|Just done listening to the CD and I was really hopeful that this would not be a repeat of the boring sound of A Thousand Suns, but this one sucks even more. They are not even a rock group anymore. They sound more like Moby and Coldplay. This is not the same group when they first came out. Ever since Minutes to Midnight, it have been steps backwards.

0312641893|5.0|My brother-in-law went to see Snow White and the Huntsmen a couple of weeks ago, and when he told us about it, he said it was \\"predictable\\". My response was, \\"It's Snow White you goof! What about that story don't  you know already?!\\" But then I went to see the movie and was blown away by how innovative and unique it was despite being a fairy tale we can all recite by memory. In fact, it was that experience that made me get over my preconceived notions about Marissa Meyer's Cinder: Book One of the Lunar Chronicles and just read it already. I mean, Cinderella and cyborgs? How much more creative can you get?!<br /><br />Cinder is a cyborg: a person with machine parts. She has more machine than most cyborgs, but she suffers the same second-class citizen status as every cyborg. In fact, the cyborg draft solidifies their status as \\"non-humans\\" to the non-cyborg folk. It allows the government to draft cyborgs against their will to be used as guinea pigs in the race against the plague to find a cure. And no one seems to mind that the cyborgs never return from these tests. But the plague is threatening the very existence of the country... almost as much the Lunars are. Luna is the country that conquered life on the moon, but over generations, the Lunars have developed \\"powers\\" or the ability to control electro-magnetic pulses that can alter emotions, feelings, and perceptions. Now their crazy Queen wants to make an alliance with the kingdoms on earth and she isn't afraid to bully or blackmail her way in.<br /><br />But Cinder's life is a lot less complicated. Not a lovely life by any means, but less complicated. She goes to work, the money she earns goes to support her stepmother and stepsisters (only one of which is awful), and she tries to hide her cyborg parts as carefully as possible. But when the crowned Prince Kai comes to her booth for help with an android, she is more worried than ever about someone learning of her cyborg parts. When the plague hits too close to home, Cinder is sent to the labs for experiments, but the results are nothing she could ever have dreamed of. Now, she is more than just a cyborg outcast, but her lot in life is no easier. Especially when all she wants is Prince Kai, a desire she won't even allow herself to dream about because there is no way a man in line for the throne who could have any girl he wanted would ever want to love a cyborg... or is there?<br /><br />OK. Let's get this out in the open. Marissa Meyer is a bloody genius! Who would have ever thought to make Cinderella into a cyborg? And if you think you are going to go into this book to find something predictable, you are totally mistaken! This is an old, well-known story that has been taken, stripped to its bare elements, and transformed into something FANTASTIC! It is Cinderella like you have never seen before, and you will love what Meyer has done to the story. Take the fairy tale element away and this is still a phenomenal story. First, I love the twists on the old story Meyer has created. Cinder's character is every bit as lovely as Cinderella, complete with the same issues and troubles, but her situation is even more dire than before. With the plague and the division of the cyborgs, she couldn't be more of an outcast. Then you have the strong science-fiction element with the androids and Cinder's family's droid Iko who has a personality chip that makes her more person than machine but completely unwanted for it. And the prince? Oh Kai is fantastic. He would even submit himself to the most awful of situations to save and protect his people. It is no wonder everyone loves Kai! I know I did!<br /><br />This is a great story for any strong middle reader through adult reader. It has a brilliant Science Fiction twist on your tried and true fairy tale, and you will be thrilled to have it on your shelves. Don't let yourself be discouraged by \\"Cyborg Cinderella\\" like I was. This story is so much more than that. This is a book that would appeal toa wide range of readers from your SF junkies to your dystopian fans to the average modern lit readers. Trust me. This isn't one to ignore! And with the way the story ended, you will be dying to get ahold of the next three books in the Lunar Chronicles!a wide range of readers from your SF junkies to your dystopian fans to the average modern lit readers.

B007LB1O3I|4.0|I was a little worried that this album was going to be pretty bland from the single \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" but Madonna surprised me. Of her most recent works, Confessions on a Dance Floor was a pretty solid album but Hard Candy seemed like she was putting her twist on techno, which turned out dismal. I thought she might be continuing in the direction of Hard Candy \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" came out. But when I saw it for $5 and I took a risk on buying it. Other than Hard Candy, I like what Madonna come out with for the most part. I am overly satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />Madonna KILLS it in the first track \\"Girl Gone Wild\\". If this song isn't heard in every dance club I enter for the next year I'll be surprised. I also think anyone who tries to mess with a remix to this song is reducing musical gold to bronze. The beat is dynamite, and the words fit perfectly. The following 2 tracks \\"Gang Bang\\" & \\"Addicted\\" are 2 dance songs but unlike GGW she seems to leave more room for other DJs to put their spin on a remix. But if you like just listening to a polished yet dirty beat, you'll like these two tracks, too. \\"Some Girls\\" and \\"I Don't Give A\\" are also a couple other highlights.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about the album is her voice. Her voice sounds thin and stretched in most of the songs. SING MADONNA! Remember Evita when you proved you could? She did a great job with the music behind the lyrics. Melodic when it need to be and upbeat & thrilling on her dance songs. I also think that she hits pretty close to home with some decent lyrics and writes about a variety of feelings. Who cares that she has 50+ years on her!? Who said she isn't still allowed to feel sexy, want the things that young people want, feel the same way everyone else might after a divorce? Maybe she does sound a little kiddish, EXPRESS YOURSELF MADONNA!<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty good album. There are some mediocre songs, but when Madonna hits, she hits it out of the park, if you ask me.k, if you ask me.

B007SGM084|5.0|This Trilogy kept me awake at nights............and mornings......and days, well, you get the idea.  These weren't the best written, but the subject & side stories (which turned out to be part of the main story line) more than made up for it.  I like that the erotic sections were written with women readers in mind.  It wasn't 'in-your-face' porn (so to speak), but it was just dirty enough to make even a Passion Party consultant pay attention!  What will EL James write next?

0307887448|4.0|(This review contains no spoilers)<br /><br />Ernest Cline's first novel, READY PLAYER ONE, is exactly as it's advertised by USA Today: the Matrix meets Willy Wonka.  The only thing I would add to that is that it also has a dash of the SCOTT PILGRIM book series as well.  The premise of the book is that the dystopian world has been consumed with an online simulation (not so different from Second Life).  The creator of this online simulation dies, and his final will includes a contest; the winner of this contest will be gifted the creator's entire fortune (that consists of multiple billions of dollars).  All of this, however, is drenched in nostalgia and retro/vintage references.<br /><br />READY PLAYER ONE is a real page turner.  It moves along at breakneck speeds; weeks and months can pass between paragraphs at times, but the narrative never feels disjointed or confusing.  The universe that Cline invents is very rich, and he is able to convey it wonderfully.  Admittedly, it will probably be easier for gamers/geeks to grasp the universe than someone outside of the audience -- many of the ideas here (online simulations, leveling up, NPC's, \\"drops\\", easter eggs) will be intimately familiar with gaming veterans, thus easier to understand.  Additionally, many of the references require some sort of preexisting knowledge of the 1980's pop culture atmosphere.  While some allusions are explained, there are plenty of encyclopedic references to pick up on.<br /><br />This novel does many things really well.  I really didn't want this book to end; I wanted to spend more time with the characters and the universe.  A lot of the enjoyment that comes from this book is in discovering this dystopian world and how the online simulation has influenced it.  There's a love story that takes place here, and unlike THE HUNGER GAMES, it felt true -- not just like another plot device.  By the end, what happens to the two lovers involved feels realistic and earnest, not pandering or manipulative.  The book also feels unique.  Even though there are Matrix/Willy Wonka comparisons, the result of this chemistry creates something entirely new and bold.  It's unabashedly geeky, but it doesn't feel amateurish or like fan-fiction.  Instead, it's a well written novel that is steeped in a subculture that has not been well represented in mass-produced literature.<br /><br />There are two issues I have with the book.  The first is that I don't exactly know if this book knows what it wants to be.  What I mean by this is that the first 2/3's or so (the book is broken into 3 \\"levels\\") have a very clear theme and tone, but the last third of the book seems to ditch these themes.  READY PLAYER ONE's first half feels very much like a satire, showing the pain and desperation of a world (and its people) that has lost itself in reality.  The statements made here are really effective, with Cline showing these characters getting lost deeper and deeper into an online simulation, it causes the reader to reflect upon our own society.  It feels like this book has something important to say.  Unfortunately, this trend gets ditched by the last third of the book.  By the ending, there was no clear message for the book; it's not that the themes were ambiguous, it's that it feels like they were forgotten in deference to more epic action.<br /><br />The second issue that I have with the book runs along the same lines as the first.  The first two levels of the book are funny, witty, and engaging.  READY PLAYER ONE is a fun, propulsive book that champions brains over brawn.  By the ending, it feels like the id of the book began to take over.  There was less witticism and more full-throttle testosterone.  That's not too say that it wasn't good: the finale is pretty thrilling.  The entertainment here just felt a little cheaper.  It feels like the online simulation is no longer a simulation, but a straight-up video game.<br /><br />I would recommend READY PLAYER ONE to anyone that has playedan MMO, or anyone that loved [[ASIN:B00448SE4S Scott Pilgrim vs. The World]].  It's a well written book and a great debut.  The book is entertaining on many levels, but there are a few times when it struggles to find its voice.an MMO, or anyone that loved [[ASIN:B00448SE4S Scott Pilgrim vs. The World]].

B007R41E8O|2.0|I had no problem with the download, but the game froze on me, forcing me to restart my Kindle Fire, and now (a) I can't see/use all of my inventory items and (b) the net doesn't work on the snake, nor can I try the bag as that is among my lost inventory items.  Very frustrating as I like these kinds of games and Alawar is such a reputable developer.  I've played a couple other similar ones to completion (e.g. Empress of the Deep) so I can't imagine what the problem is.  But with that forced restart I'm not going to fiddle around with it.  Game is about to be deleted and I'm super disappointed and frustrated.  Glad I only paid 99 cents.

B0013O123Q|5.0|I learned about Irreversible several years ago after reading some folks, I beleive it was in London, walked out on the movie because of a particular violent scene. I love foreign films and was curious as to what the fuss was all about. So I purchased the DVD and I found out what all the fuss was about. There is violence througout the movie and I can engage in watching a certain amount of violence and still be mentally ok afterwards. Well I wasn't after seeing this movie. I have only watched it once and I haven't watched it again. The actors in the movie were good, the photography was great but the brutality of the rape scene left me battered and for once I've come across a movie I can't watch again.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Read this after a recommendation from a friend, and am so glad I did.  Definitely the best book I have read in a long while.  Written with humour and tenderness and larger-than-life characters that still ring true.  Do yourself a favour and pick it up.

B000H6SXMY|1.0|Do NOT buy this. I repeat do NOT by this. i was sooooo excited the day i got it in the mail. i immediately ordered a pizza and sat down watching my favorite show. when i got to the 3rd episode, it started skipping. didn't mind at all. then it started skipping again later on. i was trying to figure out what the problem was. i looked at all the discs and i could see little tiny scratches on the discs.  (when you pull the disc out of the case, it scratches the dvd). i decided to jump to a random season and i put a random disc in. no joke. i got to the 4 episode and it started to skip again. don't by this and waste your money. your better off buying the actual dvd seasons separately. those cases are much better and no scratching involved. oh and I did all of this within the first hour of me receiving the collection
B0067EKY7M|5.0|I watched this movie at the cinema. It was brilliant. Ewan McGregor plays his part superbly as the supposedly boring fish expert caught up in the absurdity of the project. Emily Blunt makes a tearful companion, and marvellous Kristin Scott Thomas could be any one of Britain's annoying politicians. I found tears rolling down my face, as unexpected little jewels of humanity, humour and passion caught me and the audience unaware.<br />While the ending was not quite how I remember from the book (the Prime Minister does not make an appearance), the scriptwriter (Simon Beaufoy) ensures the dupe is as plausible as Paul Torday's tale.<br /><br />It is a shame authentic Yemeni landscapes could not be used. This imbalance can be redressed by checking out the pictorial [[ASIN:B00846YRMY Samak Fishing in Yemen]], a dunderhead's guidebook of photos explaining why fish cannot be caught in Yemen. Also check out my Listomania: Yemen Favourites Top Ten.

FWIW, she is going into third grade, and an avid reader (for perspective on content and difficulty).

B006RUJST6|3.0|Yeah, honestly, I don't give away stars. But hey, I thought this book was great. Will Cooper is the ideal man any girl can ever dream of. The reason why I rated this three stars is because some events that happen are WAY too-I don't know-unreal...? In my self-obsessed daydreaming teen life, I had such hopes...This book fills me with such longing that everything which happened to Lake might happen to me. I mean, I had dreams almost identical to this story and I know this sounds scary, but when I am sucked back to my own real world, I just go bullcrap with my romantic self. Like how Will is there for her every time she needed him...That really doesn't happen in real life. I hope you get my point. I love your book. I love your poems. I love your characters (most of them anyway). I love this treasured story. I will devour the sequel soon!

B003YBUSMW|3.0|The ad on Amazon is incorrect.  It does not come with the included AC adapter.  I contacted MadCatz and had a nice chat with the support people.  The two quotes from the MadCatz rep that are most interesting are below:<br /><br />10:33Mad Catz: Hello Alain, we actually haven't made the adapter, though, you can purchase one from a local computer hardware store such as Radio Shack. Does that help?<br /><br />10:40Mad Catz: When it was in development, the port was built on and we were planning to include one, but that was changed and it was intended to be used on battery power though the port was left on the build. It would seem unlikely that we will make one in the future.<br /><br />The problem is this sucker eats batteries.  It will kill three in about 90 minutes of Forza playing.  I will be heading to Radio Shack as suggested to see if I can find an adapter that will work (if any of you find one/have one, please let me know.<br /><br />Overall the device seems to be working well, the responsiveness is what I expected, not much of a dead zone and it certainly helps with the game immersion.  I have played Forza 4, Dirt 3 and Nazcar 2011 and not had any problems.  Just not sure if I can afford to keep using it without the AC adapter (even with rechargeable batteries).<br /><br />Note: The MadCatz representative was excellent, very responsive, answered the questions (even if I did not like the answer) and was clearly knowledeable.

0143117564|4.0|It must be frustrating for Pynchon to know that every reviewer will begin his or her view of all of his other works with a comparison to \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", and say that it doesn't measure up.<br /><br />But it doesn't need to.  It's a darn good book, even if might not be something that grad students are writing dissertations about thirty years from now.  It's funny, intelligent, and well-written enough to give the reader sudden, unexpected pangs of nostalgia for the LA of yesteryear.  It could be the masterpiece of many other writers, but people are always going to think of it as one of the lesser achievements of Pynchon.  Never mind that; go ahead and enjoy it for what it is instead of focusing on what it isn't.<br /><br />Stylistically, the nearest neighbors in the Pynchon universe are \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\", parts of \\"V.\\" and \\"Vineland\\", but it is disconnected from any.  If you prefer these to the longer, denser \\"Mason & Dixon\\" or \\"Against the Day\\", then you will enjoy this book.

B006HGXGWU|5.0|Before watching this film I read a review from a critic who said he was hard-pressed to recommend the movie even though he was giving it five stars.  It's dark, philosophical, and superbly acted - which is not necessarily everyone's cup of tea.  The film revolves around its male lead who experiences terrifying dreams and hallucinations.  At times he feels they are prophetic, at other times he thinks he's developing schizophrenia (which his mother had).  Each carefully crafted scene presents enough evidence to both support and negate either possibility.  Visually, the film is timeless, yet it taps into contemporary fears regarding the economy and global warming.  The ending is a stroke of genius - although it took me a few moments to process.  And then I couldn't stop thinking about it.<br /><br />This is filmmaking at its finest.  It's so perfectly crafted and nuanced that the real fun is the discussion you'll have afterwards.  If you're looking for glossy, mindless entertainment (and no, there is nothing wrong with escapism) then this is not a movie you will enjoy.

B005JSM5YW|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I was expecting much better, considering the all-star cast, as well as the generally positive reviews.  Was I surprised!  It is beyond contrived and has a VERY large \\"Ick\\" factor, regarding a barely-teenaged boy and his older teenaged babysitter.  Ugh.<br /><br />Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling appear to be acting in 2 different movies.  Carell reprises his Michael Scott role from \\"The Office\\" (as always) and Gosling is channeling a 1950's Frank Sinatra. We never know why Gosling's character would have even addressed Carell's in the bar--other than to tell him to shut up.  Why would he invest his time trying to make this douche into a \\"player\\"? Julianne Moore's character is whiny and immature.  But she's right at home with the rest of this crew.  The most mature person in the movie is the 13-year-old puppet who is spouting words of wisdom that would require more perspective than any teenager has. (\\"You have to fight for her, Dad!\\") He is completely unconcerned--and addresses the issue--when the babysitter walks in on him at an inopportune moment.  The final scene between these two is completely unbelievable--right out of the fantasy of someone incarcerated for a sex crime.<br /><br />I watched this alone, and kept wishing I had someone there, so I could turn to them and raise my eyebrows in disbelief.  What were these guys thinking??
B005DC68NI|4.0|I liked reading the history of publishing and book promotion.  The how-tos of self-publishing and promotion were presented in a clear and easy to follow way.  What made this book stand out was the addition of testimony from authors who have found success using the methods promoted in the book.  I did not give this a five star rating because I thought the number of author testimonials was a little overdone.  I did not read them all, but the ones I did read were inspirational.
B000001F5F|5.0|Under A Blood Red Sky is a great snapshot in time for U2. The handful to tracks show the band in their raw energy during the 1983 tour for War. It sort of closes the chapter on that part of the Band's life being release after War and before The Unforgettable Fire where the Band took the first of many left turns.<br /><br />If you like this, get the DVD U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky. It will give you the complete concert that some of the songs on the CD were taken from. Get the 2008 version, it contains more songs and video than the original DVD release.

1468161660|5.0|I sincerely bought this book after looking for something interesting to read after the 50 Shades Trilogy and Bared To You. I saw this book had excellent feedback and thought it would be something good to read. WHAT A BOOK! I read it within two days. Reading this book is equivalent to an emotional rollercoaster but SOOOOO worth the read. I cried, I smiled and I learned. Slammed poetry is so beatifully used in this book. I highly recommend this book for people of all ages. It is enjoyable and well written. The author is a fantastis writer and definitely look forward to reading more of her books.
B004LWZW7O|3.0|This movie was tough to watch...mainly because the entire time, I was thinking what a great movie this COULD have been. It almost feels like one of those great cheesy sci-fi flicks from the 1980s. I wanted to love it.<br /><br />What really killed this film for me was Amanda Seyfried. I don't know how this girl keeps getting parts. She isn't qualified to act in a local high school stage production, much less a major motion picture. The already terrible \\"romantic\\" dialogue between her and Timberlake is made infinitely worse by her patent inability to deliver any line without coming off as some sort of parody of the intended material. She should be relegated to b-list chick flicks where all the characters dance around the table blabbering about divorce and empowerment.<br /><br />A shame. The idea of the movie is interesting, and Timberlake is a solid enough actor. I can't help but think it would have been significantly better with an actress with even a modicum of talent.

B000BKVQTS|5.0|If you expect fairy tales, a linear plot, and Disney, this movie will disappoint.<br /><br />But I had no expectations, and I loved it.<br /><br />In many ways, it's classic Terry Gilliam: great acting, abrupt plot-jolts, creepy menacing sets, an interesting though zany story.<br /><br />The leads, Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, are wonderful.  Both are terrific: Damon and the bossy and cynical William, and Ledger as the introverted, bookish dreamer Jacob.  Even better, the plot allows them to switch places, and they manage the switch seamlessly--which all works out to teach both important lessons.<br /><br />The other actors are fine, too: the underrated Lena Headey, the characteristically crazed Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormare, the beautiful and menacing Monica Bellucci, and all the mostly Czech extras.<br /><br />The sets are just astonishing: from the gothic and morbid German towns to the moving and terrifying forest.<br /><br />And the plot is both clever and intriguing: featuring the brothers getting entangled in their own stories.<br /><br />One question: what happens to the magic beans?
B00003CXA6|5.0|An excellent movie and historically accurate. Keeps focus on the battle and those who fought it from the viewpoint of both sides. It does all this without drifting into off topic subplots or love interests.<br />Although the movie is rather long, it successfully keeps your intense interest.<br />A five star event!

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in our Stars was my first John Green Experience. It was life altering. I'm not kidding. I will never be the same after reading this. John Green has written a novel so far beyond the ordinary. It's poignant and highly addictive, with a unique cast of characters, meaningful dialogue, and beautiful pacing. On the real, I was a mess while reading this; a snotty, bleary-eyes, tear-streaked, red-nosed, heartbroken, wailing mess while reading this. There are exactly three books I can recall getting this emotional with while reading and those would be Delirium by Lauren Oliver, Beautiful Chaos by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, and We'll Always Have Summer by Jenny Han. If you check out previous posts on my blog, you'll no doubt discover how much I adored those books. The Fault in Our Stars has officially been added to my Crazy Emotional Adored Books list. Seriously, I had to get the roll of toilet paper and leave it next to me so I could blow my nose. And afterwards, I was so emotionally drained I could barely keep my eyes open. I now understand why everyone worships John Green.<br /><br />I now worship John Green.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus are unlike any characters you've ever read, I promise you. Somehow Green manages to make their dialogue a perfect combination of intelligence, sarcastic humor, and depth. I don't know how he did it. I was alternating between laughing and crying. Hazel is quite the scrapper. She was diagnosed with cancer three years ago, but she never gives up. Sometimes she wishes she could die, but I don't think she really means it deep down. She's not typically one to give up. She's strong. She's so beyond her years, too. She's smart and passionate. Determined. An all around marvelous character. And Augustus Waters. My oh my. Augustus AugustusAugustusAugustusAugustusAugustus. I LOVE YOU. Like, he's nothing you've ever seen in a YA boy. I'm not even sure I can put him into words. He's kind and strong and a beautiful person. I wish I couldmeet a guy like Augustus Waters. Together they go on adventures that are weird and heartbreaking and unique.<br /><br />I keep saying it's different and unique, but I think what I mean is that everything in this book is astoundingly real. The characters are real, the relationships are real, the plot is real. It's all real, authentic, genuine. It's difficult to explain, but people experience different things in life. John Green really thought out of the box with this book, which makes you wonder if perhaps he is secretly a sixteen year old girl with cancer, obsessed with a certain author worried that she's a grenade.<br /><br />This book is stunning. If you don't read it pronto, I will be tempted to, ya know, shank you or something. I can't emphasize enough how much you need to read it. It's moving, fresh, different, and nerdalicious! I didn't even want to like this book. I am a rebel of sorts, and I don't like to flow with the hype. So I didn't want to like it, but I couldn't help it. This book is phenomenal in a way you'll only understand if you read it. There were some sentences, paragraphs, pages, chapters that literally took my breath away.<br /><br />Just. Read. It.<br /><br />Trust me.
0307951529|5.0|Great book Chris. This book has all the info and inspiration you could need to finally get something happening in terms of starting your own business to a scale of your choice. The examples used are of 'real' people having a go at making their passion pay and succeeding! Some of them are part time, some are full time, some outsource a lot, some outsource nothing and all for low start up prices. And its all laid out what and how they have done it, as a blueprint for others to follow.<br />I recommend this book highly, and already have idea's on the board to convert to online businesses, good job Chris!<br />wildbren68
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I have read Scalzi's blog for years, but this is the first time I have taken on one of his books.  Redshirts takes what might be a one-punchline idea and turns it into something much more entertaining.  The writing moves quickly, he realizes that even funny stuff needs a counterbalance to keep being funny, and the Codas were an inspired move to tell more story in an effective way.  It was delightful.
B005OK722U|1.0|As others have mentioned, this movie is not only bad, but horrifically bad. If you like 1 and 2, you will hate this. This version seemed like it was trying to cater to the Scream/teen masses. Perhaps because of all the wonderful vampire movies lingering out there? They need people to watch..<br /><br />It would seem this version jumped the shark so bad, it can hardly be called the same \\"Hostel\\" series. The beginning starts off slow with acting that would make an incoherent drunk cringe in boredom. There is endless build up, only to be let down at every turn. It's as if 1 and 2 were covered SO WELL, that they were struggling to even come up with a plot this time around. Let's face it, the mystery was gone in part 2. Which one would expect.<br /><br />This one takes place in Vegas, a true tragedy from the beginning. The original point of this movie, is that it was hidden in Slovakia, away from prying eyes and many times, any sort of authority.<br /><br />If your looking for gore, look elsewhere. The effects were so bad and unrealistic (deaths) that I almost turned it off many times due to the cheesiness. The cockroaches ravenously entering the girl's mouth to CHOKE her was just too ridiculous and unreal that I had to laugh. This could mostly be shown on TV unedited, most of the time the gore and blood was out of focus or not in frame. I'm guessing because it looks so bad, the director didn't want any more embarrassment.<br /><br />When I saw this, I thought it was a \\"SyFy original\\".. yes that bad.<br /><br />If I were a teen, and seeing Hostel for the first time, I could see this being barely watchable. Avoid at all costs!!

0385344228|4.0|I'm not one for first person point of view stories, I find myself increasingly frustrated with only one viewpoint to contend with, but Landay does an amazing job balancing the story and keeping the tension high on a courtroom drama.<br /><br />Without giving away too many details, the story follows the travails of the son of the DA of a small town in Massachusetts. The story is told from the point of view of the father, and is thus given more sophistication. The truth about the murder never fully reveals itself until the very end, and even then there is still much doubt.<br /><br />While I can honestly say I did enjoy reading the book, I felt the technical aspects of it, at times, imposed themselves upon the reader. I also found some of the characterisations of the children in the book patently stereotypical or dishonest. There was a short section that had one of the kids testifying, Derek Yoo, and he never sounded like a kid in the courtroom, it just felt false.<br /><br />Overall, the book was actually well-written and compelling. I'm looking forward to the book club meeting where we discuss this!

6302642248|5.0|When it was first released in 1940, Walt Disney's Pinocchio failed at the box office. And it is quite a strange circumstance, as it was the studio's follow-up to the groundbreaking smash hit Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, released only two years previously. Some critical reviews of the film called it even better than its predecessor, and that is mostly the consensus opinion of today: that Pinocchio is indeed a better film than Snow White in almost every way. Its contributions to the art and cinematic form of animation are undeniably enormous, and only a very small number of animated cartoons have come anywhere close to equaling its breathtaking artistry.<br /><br />It is quite strange that Disney did not follow the success of Snow White with another fairy tale. Many were considered, including Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast. But these stories proved to be a challenge to not only the team of artists, but also to Walt himself. It was one of the studio's great animators, Norm Ferguson, who brought the attention of Carlo Collodi's The Adventures of Pinocchio to Disney's attention. For story problems and other issues, the studio halted work on Bambi (released in 1942) and production began on Pinocchio.<br /><br />Carlo Collodi's original story is one of the darkest children's stories ever written, and so Disney was obviously dealing with some very difficult subject matter. In the original story, Pinocchio is a bad kid from the very beginning. He does many bad deeds throughout the course of the first few chapters, and of course it's highly unappealing for a children's cartoon; so major changes were made to the title character that simply worked for the best: he is bright-eyed, curious, easily manipulated, and unbelievably forgetful; most young children should be able to relate to him, and so should adults who remember what it was like to be Pinocchio's age.<br /><br />It has often been said that Pinocchio is one of the darkest of all Disney animated features. And it is true in ways that are both obvious and subtle; a mixture of both works quite well. Take the scene for example, when Pinocchio is running home and stumbles into Honest John and Gideon for a second time: the Fox and the Cat, pretending to be his friends, see an \\"illness\\" in the puppet that ultimately leads to the conclusion that he needs a vacation on Pleasure Island, \\"where every day is a holiday.\\" Now we know from the scene before that Honest John and Gideon are just in it for the money, but since they are corrupt and greedy, they help out the Coachman anyway, providing him with slaves in the forms of small boys.<br /><br />The arguments that show the unsubtle darkness of the film come most prominently in two points of the film: after Pinocchio's first performance in Stromboli's puppet show where he makes plenty of money for the puppet master, he says that he is going home and will be back in the morning. At this, Stromboli becomes furious, and locks the puppet in a cage. He says that when Pinocchio grows too old, he will be chopped into firewood. But until then, Stromboli plans to make the puppet his \\"little wooden goldmine.\\"<br /><br />The other point at which the animation shows obvious gloom is in the Pleasure Island sequence. And in fact, there is also some subtlety to it as well: when Pinocchio and his new friend Lampwick are having a good time and destroying everything in sight, the latter turns and asks if the puppet likes the place. Pinocchio then turns and says \\"Yeah! Being bad is a lot of fun, ain't it?\\" In some instances, that line recalls the original Collodi tale in which the puppet is a bad boy. But then of course comes the infamous transformation sequence, when Lampwick becomes an actual jackass. There is a marvelous shot where the transformation itself is propped up like a silhouette and all the while Lampwick is screaming for his mother. It is an amount of fear and terror that is often unequaled by most of today's horror films.<br /><br />As an example of the art form of animation, Pinocchio is unsurpassed. It is visually the most impressive and the most gorgeous animated film of all time. It was made at a time before the computer, when animated cels, frames, and backgrounds were all drawn by hand but with such enthusiasm and creativity. The change from the watercolors used in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to the gouache and oil paintings used in Pinocchio make for a much richer experience, especially when exploited to the nth degree. The only animated films that could quite honestly compete visually with it are the same year's Fantasia (which had some very similar artistry, particularly during \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" sequence) and 1959's Sleeping Beauty (the perfect example of a moving tapestry).<br /><br />To make animated films of similar feeling and quality today, most animators prominently use computers, which do give a rich quality yes, but the effect is not the same. As technically marvelous as something 1992's Aladdin is, one could easily tell that a good amount of the animation was done with a computer (I say you need look no further than a look at the Cave of Wonders). To be short, the only animated films after 1959 that could compete with Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty are 1994's The Lion King (which does have a lot of computer work on it, but the level of artistry brought to the African savannah is absolutely breathtaking) and perhaps Miyazaki's 1997 Princess Mononoke (in fact, perhaps even much of the Ghibli work, almost all of which is hand-drawn with very little computer work).<br /><br />Some of the most marvelous animation set pieces in Pinocchio come quite early in the film, specifically on the shots where Geppetto is putting the final features on his little wooden puppet. Taking a look at the scene, the result feels very oily but also quite warm. I could point out many of the other scenes in the picture, but to sum it up: many people have said that the film represents \\"technically perfect animation.\\" I would most certainly agree.<br /><br />Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs had been nominated for an Oscar for its score, and earned Walt Disney an Honorary Academy Award. But Pinocchio went a step further, and became the first animated feature to not just win a competitive award, but multiple awards: it won Best Original Score and Best Original Song for the ballad \\"When You Wish Upon a Star.\\" In many cases, Academy distinctions and other such honors are superfluous and do not mean anything; but in the case of Pinocchio, the music was simply that good. These days however, the soundtrack does not receive nearly the attention it should.<br /><br />The songs in Pinocchio represent just about the strongest musical in Disney's film canon (only Mary Poppins and Beauty and the Beast have songs as good as the ones by Leigh Harline and Ned Washington). \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" of course is the main anthem of The Walt Disney Company; but the other compositions, such as \\"Give A Little Whistle\\", \\"I've Got No Strings\\", \\"Little Wooden Head\\", and \\"Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee\\" are arguably just as good, if not better. And the score by Paul J. Smith (some parts written by Harline) is an extraordinarily well-written and very underappreciated score. In the score for Pinocchio, the two men cover a range of styles from honky-tonk to romantic and from blues to Broadway.<br /><br />At the heart of the film however, is the cast of characters. Some of them have very little screen time, but they make such an impression on the audience and such a stake on the plot that it's quite difficult to imagine Pinocchio without them. Take Stromboli, for example: despite appearing in only two scenes, he carves himself a special place among Disney's most evil and threatening villains. He locks Pinocchio in a cage, tells him that he's going to be helpful in making a lot of money, and then as he gets too old, Stromboli plans to turn the puppet into firewood. His last audible line in the film is \\"Good night, my little wooden goldmine.\\" The filmmakers bring us a reverse Geppetto-type figure, one that exists only to threaten or bring further harm and humiliation to Pinocchio.<br /><br />Stromboli however, isn't the only great character in the film. Almost every main character in the film is a brilliant little masterpiece, showcasing some of the very best work done by some of Disney's greatest animators. For many of them, it was their first big assignment: Pinocchio himself was done mostly by Milt Kahl, with some contributions done by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston; Jiminy Cricket was handled by Ward Kimball, and this assignment was the only thing that kept him at the Disney Studios after two of his scenes originally planned for Snow White were discarded; Art Babbitt, in one of his last Disney projects, animated Geppetto, whom the animator thought to be his greatest accomplishment; Figaro the Cat and Cleo the Goldfish were both done by Eric Larson, one animator you don't hear a lot about; Honest John and Gideon were both done by Norm Ferguson, another precursor to the Nine Old Men; Stromboli himself was animated by Bill Tytla, who is widely considered to be the greatest animator in the history of Disney animation (Chernabog from Fantasia is more than enough to ensure that); the Coachman was the only character for a feature-length Disney film to be animated by Charles August Nichols, another unsung animator; Lampwick the delinquent is considered to be Fred Moore's finest achievement; the Blue Fairy, one of the film's greatest achievements, was animated by Jack Campbell; and Monstro the Whale (my personal pick for the greatest achievement of character animation in the whole film) was done by Wolfgang Reitherman, who would become a major director later in his career.<br /><br />These mentions and credits would be pointless though, if the animators did not put forth their greatest efforts. In Pinocchio, the works of these animators remains at least one of their three best (in Reitherman's case, I'd call Monstro his all-time best work). Only a tiny number of characters made after their time (or even after this film) have come anywhere close to equaling the marvelous achievements of the cast of characters, animated and ACTED (which is what character animation is, essentially) with such fussy detail.<br /><br />The effects animation in Pinocchio is an entirely different matter, but it might well just be the greatest achievement of the whole film: from the fire that Pinocchio cooks up to make Monstro sneeze to the glow whenever the Blue Fairy appears, and from the shadows of Lampwick and Pinocchio to the water splashes made by Monstro himself (the water ripples are perhaps the most beautiful thing drawn by anyone in the Golden Age of Animation), the effects animation by itself represent a level of artistry that cannot be matched by today's computers.<br /><br />I have yet to speak of the everlasting quality of the story: the durability of the tale of a little puppet's ambition to become a real boy is perhaps the key to everything that makes the film work. In Pinocchio's innocence and naivety, the stage is set for nearly everything else to come to prominence, from Jiminy's efforts to keep the puppet under control to Honest John's scheme to use that same puppet as a cash reward. Pinocchio's promises are always broken by the slightest temptation to slack off or have a good time, and this of course gets him into real trouble. Since this is a fantasy of the highest order, I am able to forgive the film of some its questions (such as how the Blue Fairy delivers the letter explaining where Geppetto, Figaro, and Cleo are).<br /><br />As much as Pinocchio is about avoiding temptations and doing the right thing, it is also about second chances: time and time again, Pinocchio does wrong and is chastised for it. The Blue Fairy shows up to forgive him of his lies, and Jiminy risks his neck several times to save thepuppet from the greatest perils (being made into a slave of either Stromboli's or the Coachman's). But these second chances would be pointless if Pinocchio didn't learn a lesson. He has a line late in the film that is simply marvelous: \\"I'd rather be smart than be an actor!\\" He has learned his lesson on the consequences of becoming a star, but when Pleasure Island rolls around, he has yet another lesson to learn: while all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, all play and no work is more than enough for a boy to make a jackass of himself. The combination of second chances, ambition, and learning from mistakes makes Pinocchio one of the most important parables in not just the history of Disney, but also in the history of film literature.<br /><br />The success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs poured money into the studio's vaults like nobody's business (Sergei Eisenstein himself called it the greatest film ever made). But it is still strange to this day that Pinocchio, such a thing of beauty and a major step up from its predecessor, was an initial failure. These days however, it has literally enshrined itself a place in cinematic history as one of the major achievements in animation as well as the 1940s in general. If Snow White was a sign that animation could make a significant mark on the history of film, Pinocchio broke through and made that claim. It is considered to be Disney's greatest film for many different reasons, and rightly so. It is a thing of visual and poetic beauty that is also an uncontested masterpiece, and certainly one of the greatest films ever made.dible line in the film is \\"Good night, my little wooden goldmine.\\" The filmmakers bring us a reverse Geppetto-type figure, one that exists only to threaten or bring further harm and humiliation to Pinocchio.<br /><br />Stromboli however, isn't the only great character in the film.

B007SGM084|3.0|I waited till after I read all three to write a comment. Whereas the story itself has a chance, the writing was awful. IT was ok but to be honest I do not think I will go back and read it again. It was an ok one time read but not something you could say I'll go back and read a year from now. It is a little cheesey but there are a few parts in the series that are potentially a good read but then the author starts off on all the sex. Now I uderstand really and truthfully in any relationship sex is good thing but seriously alot of this I think was the author's own fantasies in her writing, which is not a bad thing again but at least pace yourself....lol! Overall, it was not a bad read but I can honestly say I have read better written novels.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|I wanted to play for a few days and try out the game before posting.  It was amazing to watch the deluge of negative reviews during the day this app was FAOTD.  I am no fan of IAP, either, but am a huge fan of the actual game.  Regardless of your thoughts on the morality of IAP, this game doesn't need it.  It's only for those impatient enough to not actually play the game.  It did seem to be unfortunate for the developer to make this choice when they appear to somewhat responsive to players (ie removal of openfeint).  And overall I'm glad to see the balance of reviews somewhat bouncing back after tanking when this app was free.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the game.  As others have said, it's a solid copy/port? of The Space Game.  Very fun mix of resource gathering and defense.  I love this take on defense games.  Campaign is short and the game does get repetitive, but the game looks beautiful on my Kindle Fire and is a solid 4-star game, but 5-stars to hopefully give a balanced idea for future purchasers.
B005LAIHZY|1.0|Pixar proves the dreadful WALLE was no fluke and saddles movie-hungry kids and parents with this sad, heavy handed European fable. In the theatre, I wanted those 2 hours back. I can't imagine watching this at home. Too scary for the little ones,  Brave is another magic-driven plotless morality tale beating you relentlessly over the head, which I have learned to expect from Disney. The heroic Merida deserves better than being cast in this horrible movie that firmly proves that Pixar has lost its way.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|ease of use... fun game play... tasks are enjoyable and the tutorial/ arrow hints are useful when learning new tasks... nice take on an old classic
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I simply love it. Lots of different puzzle shapes. Never get board. One of the best games ever created. This app is so easy to use. You will love it too.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have a kindle fire but wanted this app on my IPhone for when I'm out and about and don't have my kindle fire with me but I can't seem to even get it to download to my IPhone! Is it (my iPhone) not a compatible device for this app??? Please help I really really want this app on my iPhone as well! Thanks in advance!
B002V9PEU4|5.0|Not many people appreciated the genius of this movie when it came out. The most self aware action/comedy ever produced. It was a total bomb but us 80's - early 90's kids and teenagers and kids at heart discovered this mutha out on video and man were we pleased! Charles Dance makes a great British bad guy. Remember him from The Golden Child and also the sympathetic doctor in Alien 3? Well he's at his best as the cynical bad guy and funny as hell when he needs to be. Arnold is at his sarcastic best and very likable putting up with that know-it-all brat/good kid Danny Madigan. The Blu-ray is a really top notch effort in the sound and picture department. The picture is amazing. Good to have this in widescreen finally. What did the director and producers blame this being a bomb for? Going up against Jurassic Park that summer??? Well, it can please any age renting it or taking a chance on it. Glad this is cheap and in my Arnold collection. Now if they would only release Kindergarten Cop and Twins in a widescreen two-pack on Blu-ray that would really please me to no end.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I read a lot and have never written a review before mainly because i couldn't be bothered however this is one of the best books I have read. As such I thought the author deserved encouragement and i want the next book. Great story and good character development certainly rivals Weeks, Brett and Sanderson.
B00005K483|2.0|I was expecting to get a Canon hood, as stated in the description, but its not Canon. It;s not staying on lens good, amd sometimes getting out accidentally.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I played the free game and had fun; but this will not let me download after I bought the app. so frustraiting
B0054JZC6E|5.0|You get a lot for free. Lots of fun mini games. I can't get enough of them. I just love this app.
B005VT42BS|5.0|I have over 30 devices connected to my home network including my ESX pool and managed Cisco switches and it detects all of them and gives me manufacture info along with their DNS names. I have DNS running on a separate server and it has an icon to match, DHCP icon to match and it lets me know what device my current wifi connection is running on. If I switch it updates to the new managed wi-fi, this is a tech tool you'll love.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|i was expecting an interesting, fresh story and not to be hit with all the possible clicheés of the genre. The writting is poor, the leads have no personality. The female lead goes from being intriguing at the beginning  to losing all spark and becoming some troubled genius. It is clear from the depiction of the university life and poker that little to no research was done.<br />Written for 13 year olds with low expectations, a short attention span and very bad memory.
B0086700CM|5.0|YES!It's finally here!THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER! TOTALLY RECOMMEND! this app is sooooooooooo fun I play it like every single morning for at least a half an hour.<br />In this app u can buy charachters. wallpaper and so much more. U SHOULD TOTALLY BUY.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really thought I would enjoy this book more than I actually do. Maybe it's because there was so much hype, but when I finished, there was no satisfaction as expected. As for the hot and heavy stuff, I've read better.... Agreeing with some people on this review, the sex scenes were short and vocabulary is annoyingly redundant. As for books 2 & 3 (yes, I've read those too) there was not much improvement. However, I do like Christian Grey's character, seeing him open up and accept change and adapt to the unexpected. Overall, I'll rate a B for enjoyment reading only, but a D for those who are critical readers or want depth out of this book.
0385344228|5.0|Read.  This.  Book.<br /><br />Andy Barber is an assistant District Attorney in his suburban hometown, well versed in the law and how to put a criminal behind bars.  The entire town is rocked when a fourteen year old boy was found brutally murdered, and Andy's world is thrown upside down when his own son, Jacob, is the accused.  Can Andy Barber prove his son innocent?  Should he?<br /><br />Ever since I turned the last page, I have been telling everyone I see to read DEFENDING JACOB, just so I can have another person to talk to about this book.<br /><br />If you would like to read my full review, visit AlisonsBookMarks [dot] com

0375869026|5.0|Don't miss this one.<br /><br />Halloween is Auggie's favorite holiday, because he can wear a mask.  August Pullman, or Auggie to his family and friends, is an ordinary kid in most ways.  He was born with facial deformities, and despite countless surgeries, he still looks different on the outside.  On the inside, where few people are allowed, he is funny and smart and so so brave. Auggie embarks on a journey much more scary than any surgery - the 5th grade.<br /><br />You will be hard-pressed to find any character as courageous as Auggie in children's literature this year.  RJ Palacio gifts her readers with a fast-paced, heart-wrenching, honest look at a great family who was dealt a great challenge.<br /><br />Told from different points of view, the reader not only gets to see inside Auggie's mind, but that of his sister, his friends, and even someone who sees his situation from afar.  The role of the sister really got to me (those of you who know me understand why this is so) and I applaud RJ Palacio for giving her such an honest voice.<br /><br />One of the most powerful parts of the book was not how loudly the other kids made fun of Auggie, it was how QUIET they were.  It sucks to be called names, but it's even worse to be ignored.  The kids at school had a secret game called The Plague, which was compared to the Cheese Touch.  No one could touch Auggie without getting The Plague.  The thing is, all the kids thought he didn't know...how could he not?  This is bullying that no one sees coming.  It's hard to identify, and even harder to stop, but it hurts the worst.<br /><br />WONDER has stuck with me since I read it, and there are so many scenes I could point to and gush all over, but I don't want to give anything away.  (The Precepts!!!)  Do yourself a favor - read the book, give it to a middle grader to read, and then talk about it.<br /><br />To read more of my reviews, come visit me at AlisonsBookMarks dot com
B002XMGGJM|1.0|This movie starts out with a very disturbing plot.  If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about.  That aside, the movie gets interesting when the main character starts carrying out his plans for revenge.  You might be thinking \\"4 stars\\" to yourself at that point.  Then the movie advances and things get bizarre.  It's almost like they took two movie scripts and merged them together without much thought to how they tie into one another.  At some point, the main character has lost his mind and the movie that once had you rooting for him (since he lost his family in front of his eyes) now has you wanting him dead because he himself has now become a psychopath.  If you consider the first 50-75% of the movie on it's own, this might get 3-4 stars, but as a whole gets 1 start or less.
B00881VLCE|4.0|pretty cool and fun app. a great way to pass time. super easy to play. needs more puzzles though. worth downloading
B008FWHGYS|1.0|Seemed promising, based on the preview and all star cast, but the movie contains no more than 5 minutes of interesting scenes, most of which happen in the beginning of the movie.  Don't expect the film to elaborate on things to which the preview alludes...<br /><br />Watching this movie is like taking a long, boring ride through the desert.
0345803485|5.0|I must say that I'm shocked to see how many people hated this trilogy enough to give it one star. I was a college English major and I will say, it's not a literary masterpiece but it IS an addictingly wonderful story. I read all 3 books in less than a week and found myself very sad when it was over. It is total, utter fantasy. There is nothing terribly believable about the circumstances but hey - it's fan fiction !!!! Ana and Christian will have a place in my heart for years.  A story that is truly hard to shake....
B005DESVPO|5.0|The power and clarity of Gary Clark's playing pulls you right into his music.  The structure of the songs and the supporting musicians make this a TOP TIER CD.  All I can say is please record more ASAP.  Also please come to Dallas soon so we can see you live.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I'm a writer of erotica - I wrote [[ASIN:B00865ZZ5Q XXX College Erotic Stories - Volume I]], I have unfortunately read a lot of poorly written stories.  This is not one of those examples.  While I wouldn't hold it up as one of the greatest literary works of all time, it is an entertaining read.  Yes, the characters are written a bit \\"over the top\\", but it didn't stop me from being drawn to their chemistry.  I'm interested to see how this book gets turned into a movie!
0141197692|5.0|I love these books!  Of course Jane Austen is amazing, and any edition of her books would be cherished, but the Penguin Classics editions are so pretty, and they have interesting introductions and helpful notes that give a history on certain things mentioned in the stories.  They broaden your understanding of the time period in which Austen was writing, and deepen your appreciation of the story.  I am so pleased with them.
B0086700CM|5.0|it keeps me alert and aware. It keeps my reflexes on point n lets me hav fun while doing it.
B006POGWA2|4.0|This was an interesting concept for a movie and we really enjoyed it.  I think Craig and Harrison played well together on screen and the characters were developed pretty well.
B004UCYVC2|5.0|ordered for my olympus camera, worked just as i expected it to be. Price was great and product arrrived when expected.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed each and every book.  I could not put them down.  :)  I hope to see more in the future.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the game for the most part... I like that it is challenging and you can choose different games to play.  I wish it didn't always have ads pop up but I guess that's part of a free game :)
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I am so pleased with my purchase the stickers are decent size and give a beautiful look to my baby's room. I love the tiny little gems that came with it too and I put them around the princesses and wow that changed the entire look. Very happy.
B0072V394E|1.0|Inconsistent.  The hero goes from super-competent to super-stupid.  The dubbing is terrible, the dialog sappy, and the plot makes no sense.  Waste of time.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game I love it but I think the character's would be less money so we could buy it easier
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I watched Teen Wolf season one and I loved it. I am hooked. I saw most of the shows on tv when I could but I am so glad I bought this and caught up on all the episodes before season two came on. I can't wait for season two to come out on dvd. I was sort of skeptical about the show at first but it is really a good show with good actors and not just a teenager show. It has good special effects, action, drama and comedy. I think the cast works very well together. I highly recommend this to any one who wants to be entertained while watching tv which is a rarity these days.
B0086700CM|5.0|I play temple run everyday my high  score when I first got the game was 135,678 my high score now is 1,678,452!! see how much I have imporved!!!
B00464CU7W|5.0|This Blueray is exactly what we ordered and expected.  Katherine Jenkins is lovely.  Her voice is sweet and strong.  We love her and the Blueray disc very much.
B004OR1X6A|5.0|I've read \\"The man who changed my musical life was Rory Gallagher, I picked up a guitar because of him.\\" Those words were delivered by none other than Smiths/Modest Mouse/The Cribs guitarist Johnny Marr, and a bevy of others have long been influenced by the Irish musician who has not always gotten his due since his passing in 1995. Gallagher's impeccable guitar work was both technically inspiring and emotionally captivating, qualities that are immediately apparent on \\"Notes From San Francisco\\". The 2-CD release features a never-before reissued studio album recorded back in 1978, as well as an unreleased 1979 concert from San Francisco. These unheard gems are classic Gallagher fare, with even familiar tracks like \\"Overnight Bag\\" taking on new life thanks to the guitarists' constantly transforming style and creative fills.\\"<br /><br />If you enjoy great guitar riffs, this is the artist and offering that you shouldn't pass by. This album was scrapped back in 1978 by Gallagher and we should be pleased that it was resurrected for all to enjoy.<br /><br />Jimi Hendrix considered Gallagher as \\"The greatest guitarist of his time.\\" Imagine what he could do if he was with us today.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This was a very sad story, but well-written.  I'm sure that this story has a bit of realism in it. I recommend it.
B008133MDK|5.0|Its great show, you  have show that update and style, the story is brilliant.. the bad guy is bad,they took it different level...Its worth buying instant video and the DVD..its cheaper for instant video looks great and if you have hi def TV is comes out 1080 on TV
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Love it. I have been using it to dress up my pics. easy to use. Made some funny pics using the app.
B004INNRFK|5.0|This collection is fantastic! I bought it because Donna Summer is in it. It's one of the last, if not the last public performance she gave. The quality is excellent. The whole DVD is quite good, I found it very entertaining.
0763655465|4.0|Dogs do not really want to misbehave - they just have less willpower than their human owners!<br /><br />But really, is George to blame when Harry left the scrumptious looking cake on the table, just within reach? Is George to blame for his downward spiral after that, giving into his every whim and temptation when his resolve was so broken down with that cake in front of his face?<br /><br />I enjoyed this book very much. The colors are popping and the story is cute and applicable to all dog owners and lovers. How many times has your dog shredded an article of clothing or craned his/her neck just a bit to taste test your dinner? Universal doggie traits are very noticeable in this book and will make you laugh aloud.<br /><br />Oh No, George! is a super cute book about a dog and the many temptations he faces when he is left alone at home. It is also about the loyalty, playfulness, and sweetness of dogs. With its colorful and beautiful illustrations, Oh No, George! is a must read for dog owners everywhere, who will see a bit of their own dogs in George.<br /><br />Recommended for children ages three and up and dog lovers of all ages!<br /><br />Google \\"The Musings of ALMYBNENR\\" to see this review in its original format and to follow my book review blog for more reviews as well as bookish content.<br /><br />Please note: Whatever I rate a book here, please check what the ratings mean on Goodreads, because those are what I go by.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it's very addictive<br />heaps of fun for all<br />my daughter loves it and I'm rather enjoying helping her along too
B004EQAVHI|5.0|I saw this \\"at the movies\\".  This story and film puts into words and images exactly what you feel when you are told you will be drafted for yet another stupid war for profit.<br /><br />All of your dreams and accomplishments up to that point are suddenly worthless.<br /><br />You are told that your sole purpose is to fight and die for nothing.<br /><br />I knew a half dozen boys who did not come back from Vietnam. Very profoundly dead and for nothing...<br /><br />Good flick and a good story. Should be mandatory viewing for every citizen.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great Series!! Exciting and entertaining. There is so much more to the story then the \\"love scenes\\" that everyone is talking about. Wonderfully written. Each book is better then the one before it.
B007ZBWJXI|3.0|I love Asia. I have listened to all their albums...I really don't get how people compare this to the original album. Sorry, it's nowhere close - nor will it ever match what the debut gave our ears.<br /><br />To me, every band member has been told to \\"hold back\\" on their playing...everything is subdued. Geoff would add wonderful, texture-based fills in between lyrics...and nothing like that is really on this album - just mostly piano and chord-based stuff. Steve's playing is still good as always, but still sits low in the mix on most songs. Carl's powerful drumming is just simple beats - nothing flashy at all. John sounds great as ever! I love his voice, and it almost sounds like it could be his solo album.<br /><br />I know Asia's lyrics aren't the most thought-provoking, but the writing on most of these songs are nonsense. The music is fantastic, but hearing the lyrics matched with some of the music, it sounds way too out of place. \\"Whenever the world is threatening to be so, just wrap it up and throw it like a ball\\"....\\"I need to know, when will you be there? I'll be there after midnight, and I'll be solo.\\" Really, John?<br /><br />Omega was my favorite right after the original and Alpha. I would have thought they would surpass what they did on Omega so I was optimistic! The songs on Omega were fantastic and had great prog-like middle sections that showed off each members talent. On this album, it happens only a couple times. Very disappointing. A catchy chorus has always been their forte, and some songs capture it, but the lyrics, again, detract from the music.<br /><br />Though this album isn't their best, there are a few very good songs. Highlights include \\"Tomorrow the World\\", my favorite \\"Bury me in Willow\\", and \\"Face on the Bridge\\".  The other songs are just...meh. Nothing really inspiring and I am very disappointed because I was expecting a lot more from a very talented group!<br /><br />Recommended if you enjoy Asia and what to support them, but be warned- sounds similar to a slightly better \\"Phoenix\\" album.<br />If you enjoyed Phoenix, you will enjoy this. Give the album a listen and make your judgement. \\"Bury me in Willow\\" is a very catchy song and up there as a great song on my list. If you take one thing from this review, just please listen to this song.
B000E3LIO0|5.0|An old classic I loved this DVD great 4 science fiction buffs ...excellent.Amazing how much. damage a spider can do!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|annoying thing, is certain objectives dont go away even if completed. have had to buy animal more than once.  also, idk how, but some of my animals have just completely disappeared, as if i never bought them.  game waists my coins.  wierd thing, i put 1 item in storage, when i go back to get it out, there's 1300 more. great for getting coin if you sell the items back, but strange. i've also put an animal in storage without a mate, and shen i take it out it has a mate.
1250006341|5.0|Oh, my goodness...if you are a Downton Abbey lover, then you must own this book. The photography is beautiful and one gets so much information about the show. It is my coffee table book,and one that doesn't just sit there, but is read and looked at often.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is really fun to me in first time. however, when you keep playing it, it makes you bored because it's endless. no1 is gonna spend all day long to play it, unless they are stupid.
B006RUJST6|3.0|This book was ok, it's no 5 star book. I'm noticing on some reviews, its like a flock of sheep, everyone follows. I don't understand it. I wouldn't reccomend this book. It's mediocre. It's a book I will forget. It wasn't bad and it wasn't that good.
B0029LHWFO|1.0|This book is just like everthing surrounding this imposters life, lies! In the book it's okay for him to make up stuff as if it were real, he is completely incompetent but does have a masterful imagination. Should stick to fiction.
0345803485|4.0|I will say that overall, the reviews here weren't that great. It is one of those books that you actually have to read because of so many mixed reviews. I honestly liked the first book and do plan on reading the rest. Is it very on the repetitive side? Absolutely. I sometimes find myself rolling my own damn eyes at all of it, but past that I do like the story line and what not. It wasn't a bad read. Again, this is one of those books you have to make the decision about reading.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a relaxing game to play during a break or before bed. I enjoy it very much. two thumbs!
B004V9MU86|4.0|I was recommended by a friend to read this book after I was explaining my mothers traits (who grew up in Germany during world war 2).<br />I am finding this book very interesting to hear it from a Germans point of view. It has a slow start and once you understand the angle in which the book is written, you should enjoy it. If nothing else, it will help explain what they - the Germans - went through during that time.<br />I am enjoying it immensely. Hope you do too.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Progressive Rock had a relevant transition from 70's to 80's and in my opinion three groups leaded that change.  Rush with \\"Geddy Lee's synthesizer period\\", Marillion with Fish & Hogarth periods,  and Asia with Wetton, Downes, Howe & Palmer lineup.  These new progressive rock was concentrated in melody, the Hammond keyboard sound was replaced with string, piano and orchestra arrangements, the songs were shorter, less darker, etc..  These super groups are back with new productions in 2012 !!<br /><br />It is a shame that Asia with original lineup stop making music for more than 20 years, however at  the same time I am glad because they returned reloaded with 3 solid albums such as Phoenix, Omega and XXX.  I have heard twice XXX and can not anticipate if it's better than Omega or Phoenix, and also have no preference with a specific track.  However what I can say is that each track of XXX sounds great and powerful.  This lineup has a unique chemistry when they put music together and each member seems to be more creative without having the ghost of their original's group leadership, such as Anderson & Squire (Downes/Howe), Keith Emerson (Palmer).<br /><br />Each member is recognized as virtuoso and that's one of the reason they were labeled as supergroup back in 1982.  Nevertheless they have been concentrated to create melodic and polished music instead of showing their virtuoso abilities, which of course you can hear highlights in each album they have ever made.  I highly recommend XXX, Omega and Phoenix for those who have not taken a chance to listen this new Asia Realoaded !!
0374280967|1.0|I was so excited to order this book and couldn't wait to read it. I am married to an englishman and fancy myself somewhat knowledgeable about their ways so I anticipated enjoying reading and laughing about the Queen's antics. Well,I didn't have one ha-ha at all. Upon completion, I asked my husband to read it and explain it to me. He didn't find it amusing either.
B002GJT4XM|5.0|This product will not disappoint the buyer - everything you hope for on the DVD.  I recommend it to everyone who loves the Harry Potter story
B003UHUBXQ|5.0|I found the book very enlightening.  The excite and the terror associated with each mission.  I'm glad the problem with motion sickness was identified. It's a shame that this was viewed as a show stopper when it is a unappreciated health problem.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I'll be short and sweet... This is one of the best television series ever in terms of characterization, world building, and rampant teenage appeal. The soundtrack is flawless. It has one of the best pilots and one of the best finales ever (a rare combo). The only drawback is that Amazon must ship it via donkey through desert and canyon because all the discs were jostled, some scratched, and the plexiglass cracked. Alas, I shan't be a dick and review The O.C. Poorly when it's Amazon that deserves the bad review. Reviews dissing the packaging are by idiots, it's beautiful packaging. Stellar show.
0316077046|4.0|I had mixed feelings about _Beautiful Creatures_, but it was a page-turner. I did not remember the mixed feelings when I read _Beautiful Darkness_, I just knew it was by an author I knew. This is good because I went into it without many preconceived notions.<br /><br />When I read my review of the first novel just now, I see that I liked this one a lot more than the first. It does pour on a lot more paranormal types than necessary in one novel. Incubus, Casters, and Keepers. Oh my! To name just a few. The three are plenty. I'm not that into the teen romance part of it (I'm too old!), but it does make a good motive for Ethan's continued tries at rescuing his \\"Natural\\" Caster girlfriend.<br /><br />Again, the authors have created a page-turner - one for which I wanted to stay up late. I like Ethan (the Wayward mortal) and Amma (his housekeeper/seer) a lot more in the growing familiarity and ways we get to see them. Lena, the Caster girlfriend, is largely absent from the book except as a holy grail kind of goal. That was fine with me because Ethan and his friends were entertaining enough without her unavoidable drama. Overall, good book!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is a wonderful time waster.  it reminds me of games that I play on facebook that I couldn't play on my kindle fire but no more of that.
0316044695|5.0|This book is a great read about the endurance, will-power, courage, and sacrifice of the SEALs.  The book is very well written. However, the first 6 chapters could have been written into one or two. The first chapter is important as it creates the base. However, chapters 2-5 talk about his personal life, the SEAL training, and little bit about the life of his comrades.  I read quickly through chapters 2-5 and did not miss much. The action begins in chapter 6 and subsequent chapters keep you on the edge of the seat!

B005IQZB14|5.0|I found this an interesting and exciting account of a young woman's journey, not just her walk on the Pacific Crest Trail but also her search for herself.  Her experiences were related in great detail and enabled the reader to feel her pain and her triumph.
B0086700CM|5.0|fun and addicting. though it doesn't seem to actually have an ultimate goal, for me the goal is to score high on the leaderboards.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|Mark Lanegan can do little wrong in my opinion, so I'm starting out biased.  There is no other voice I'd rather hear sing.  But that isn't all you get with this one, the music is diverse, all wonderful.  There's something for everyone whose ever loved him.  Grey Goes Black is reminiscent of old Screaming Trees, Ode To Sad Disco is actually danceable, which for him, is new territory.  He pulls that off with grace.  Riot in My House and Quiver Syndrome rock harder than the kids can (hallelujah for the older folks still writing music!) and the rest of the album is for people like me who just love Mark Lanegan singing low and quiet over a more simple musical backdrop.  His solo work has always been my favorite.<br />If you love this, find the the track \\"Burning Jacob's Ladder\\" and download that as well.

B005LAIGWS|1.0|Think of this movie as a reboot and not a sequel, first off.  It is much closer to the comic than it's predecessor, but the cinematography is terrible as is the acting.  Absoultly horrible.  One scene you get Johnny Blaze trying to fight off being the Ghost Rider which was absolutely hysterical, only to crash his bike......seriously.  Why Europe?  His main weapon, Penence Stare looks more like a love scene......in fact I am wondering if it worked at all.....then the the meeting with the gent who know where to find one of the principle bad guys is at some weird gathering where it looked like a MMA smack down......against a pig......seriously.  Rent/Borrow the movie and save your cash.  It is very apparent that Hollywood will not do Ghost Rider any justice at all, just like ruining Punisher......sorry to say.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I enjoyed \\"John Carter,\\" an adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' \\"Barsoom\\" stories.<br /><br />The movie is framed with scenes of a young Burroughs, played by Spy Kids' Daryl Sabara, being summoned to the estate of his late uncle, a world traveler and former Confederate cavalryman. Taylor Kitsch, from Friday Night Lights and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, is the eponymous Capt. Carter, who finds himself mysteriously transported from late 1860s Arizona to an inhabited Mars.<br /><br />On the desert world, Carter encounters tribes of Tharks, four-armed green men, led by the honorable Tars Tharkas (voice and motion capture of Willem Defoe). Despite his initial reluctance to become involved in another civil war, Carter is soon entangled in the conflict between the city-states of Zodanga and Helium, both of which are populated by humanlike \\"red\\" Martians.<br /><br />After meeting the beautiful scientist and princess Deja Thoris (played by X-Men Origins' Lynn Collins), Carter decides to fight Sab Than (Dominic West), the Jeddak (chieftan) of Zodanga, and Thern mystic Matai Shang (Mark Strong). He's aided by Sola (Samantha Morton), the compassionate daughter of Tars Tharkas, and doglike calot Woola.<br /><br />If this plot seems familiar, it's because Burroughs created the template for the \\"planetary romance,\\" which led to a century of space operas from Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, and even Superman to Dune, Star Trek, and Star Wars to Stargate, Farscape, and Avatar. The lost but brave Earth man, the spunky princess and sidekicks, the honorable alien warriors, and the mystic duels have become clich&eacute;s, but John Carter shows us the vitality of their source.<br /><br />The actors seem to be enjoying themselves with the interplanetary swashbuckling. The script by Michael Chabon takes itself seriously, but not too seriously, with humor similar to that found in the original Star Wars or another pulp revival, The Mummy. I'm currently reading Chabon's Pulitzer Prize-winning The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay for former co-worker Ken G.'s \\"Escapists\\" book club.<br /><br />Even in this age of computer-enhanced visuals, the Tharks' facial expressions, the fleet-footed Woola and fierce white apes, the crawling city of Zodanga, and the steampunk airships were all impressively designed and rendered. The aliens interacted smoothly with the human actors. Despite the daunting amount of exposition required for such a movie, I thought that director Andrew Stanton, who also directed Pixar's Wall-E, did a decent job of pacing.<br /><br />The grand vistas include the rough-and-tumble frontier of the American west, the windswept deserts of Mars, the rain-soaked streets of New York, and soaring structures and ancient ruins of Barsoom. The soundtrack also evokes a lost age of adventure, although it's not as memorable as the works of John Williams.<br /><br />I'd give John Carter, which is rated PG-13 for violence, an 8.5 out of 10, four out of five stars, or an A-. Many critics have gleefully pointed out that Disney's adaptation is somehow subject to the \\"curse of the Mars movies\\" and gotten less-than-stellar box office. However, I and other fans feel that many of their criticisms are unfair and typical of mainstream prejudice against genre entertainment.<br /><br />By contrast, I've found video game flick Prince of Persia nearly unwatchable, and a preview image for the upcoming Lone Ranger also stirs doubts about its quality aside from easy parody. I recommend John Carter to anyone who appreciates old-fashioned sword-and-planet fun.

B004YM6JLO|5.0|Been watching this since the beginning because I had read the books prior to the show. This series has blown my mind and is definitely not comparable to that of Twilight. So sorry Twihard fans but these vampires do not sparkle.
B005LAIGSC|5.0|A huge Denzel fan so I knew this was going to be another great hit. Was impressed with Ryan Rynolds role as well. Another great up and coming star! This is a must to add to your collection. [[ASIN:B005LAIGSC Safe House (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)]].
0755322819|5.0|A readable and enjoyable dark fantasy novel, set in the modern US. The main protagonist, Shadow, is a character whom you are rooting for from the first few paragraphs and this really carries the story along through some pretty strange happenings.<br /><br />It is a long book, as others have noted, but not too long, at least not for my taste. the more good writing you get for your money the better, as far as I am concerned. The start is a little slow, but things soon get moving. The part I enjoyed most was the subplot set in a winter-bound Wisconsin town, which plays out from the middle to end of the book. There are a couple of twists that I didn't see coming, and overall the plot works out well.<br /><br />The idea of Gods being fed by belief, weakening as their followers dwindle, is not a new one. Terry Pratchett explored it in his masterful Small Gods, for one, and I was a little sceptcial that this novel might just be a copy. It's not. Gaiman's story is set in 'our' world, and his writing style is very different from Pratchett's It's a darker, more grown up story, and events unfold in a very different way. Despite being based on a similar idea, the two are really very different.<br /><br />If you like fantasy or horror, you'll almost certainly enjoy it.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I don't think I ever cried as much as I did with any other series as I did with this one. Seriously!<br /><br />The story is touching. I love Eddie.  Of course, Lake and Will are the cutest.  I was left wondering why Julia never asked how Lake's car had been fixed... but whatever.  It was entertaining. It made me laugh. It made me cry!  And it made me think!  Lots of wonderful motherly advice, great words to live by, common sense stuff that everyone is hopefully being told by their mother.  But in case they are like Will, and Lake, it's nice to know there is a book out there that is filled with lovely nuggets of knowledge that is actually relatable.<br /><br />I highly recommend.
0061689246|5.0|There is something magical about this book, something that makes you feel as if you have been transported back to your childhood, yet you still know everything you know now. You are the wise and witty, woe  ridden and world weary person you wanted to be as a child. You're having fun reading a fairy tale but you aren't a kid. It's great.<br />It's hard to explain how this book makes you feel.<br />Gaiman somehow manages to take every fairytale character you've ever met and turn them into someone you recognise. Yes, they're magical - good or evil, but still ... you've met that person, or someone very like them. And every character evokes an emotion - a difficult thing to achieve, yet Gaiman does it.<br />I am not an unreserved fan of Neil Gaiman, some of his recent work is losing its sparkle for me. But this never will. In Stardust, he hit the nail on the head. If you are just starting with Neil - try this one first.<br />Oh, and it's a LOT better than the movie.
1400052181|5.0|After reading this book, \\"its about time\\" is what first comes to mind. I think Rebecca Skloot did a wonderful thing writing a book about the woman behind Hela cells. I was apprehensive reading this at first since I'm not a scientist and never have been, but the book is basic enough and describes enough in layman's terms that anyone can get a good understanding about Hela cells and what they have done for mankind. This book also opens up your eyes to the fact that there are probably many untold stories of \\"heros\\" out there.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|The movie ordered was brand new and in great condition.  It's a great kid movie but adults \\"young at heart\\" enjoy it as well.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I saw most of this movie in a psychology class in high school, at the time we were discussing mental illness. I found it to be a really interesting take on schizophrenia, so I bought it. It was used but I thought it was new because it was in such good condition. Jennifer Connelly did a great job as the wife of the main character John Nash (Crowe). Throughout the movie I felt really sympathetic for Nash because I could see how he struggled to overcome his disorder. I also could see how his wife struggled having to now care for her husband and their baby. I read Nash's real biography, were he states that *****SPOILER******SPOILER******SPOILER**********SPOILER******SPOILER******SPOILER**********SPOILER******SPOILER******SPOILER**********SPOILER******SPOILER******SPOILER**********SPOILER******SPOILER******SPOILER***** after he discovered that the voices in his head weren't real he discontinued the use of medication, in the film it says he was still on medication, which is not true in his real life.
B00003CWRX|5.0|This movie was used and for a fair price, it came in a good shape. The DVD looked like it was new and looked like it had not been played before. Every scene was great and not one DVD mistake was made either. I loved it!
0345803485|1.0|This book was terrible.  I do not understand how it can have a single positive review.  The writing was apallingly bad, the plot nonexistenet, and the much lauded sex scenes were unrealistic and juevenile.  The fact that this book is a best seller makes me believe the human race is doomed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A detailed, well-written and page turning novel.  I found the writing, the story and the style pleasant, worthwhile and fascinating from page one until the surprising end. I did not see that coming.  What a heavy topic that was dealt with responsibly and with the necessary weight for the seriousness of the topic written about.  Looking forward to discussing this book at our next book club meeting.  Definitely not your run of the mill novel...highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a perfect game to keep you busy and entertained. when you get bored with one just earn more points to lunlock another and another.
B008764ZQ4|4.0|Hey, this was worth $2.99 for the download just to hear Tom Cruise sing Paradise City, and Pour Some Sugar On Me!
0345803507|4.0|I absolutely LOVED reading all the books in the trilogy! I didn't put them down for 3 days and actually was sad to end the books so I re-read them a 2nd time. I hope the author makes a book on Christian's perspective. That would be amazing. The only issue I had with getting the books off of Amazon was that the 3rd book fifty shades of freed the pages fell out. It was a brand new book and several of the pages weren't bound in the book. I discovered that while reading the pages. Big disappointment having to shove the pages back in. It still didn't stop me from reading but be aware that some of the books are poorly made.
0345803507|5.0|A good enjoyable read. Fast pace and easy to follow along. A good book.<br />Good modern romance.  I would recommend..
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy all the different puzzles and game styles. Some controls are difficult but I take that as a challenge.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The game is a good balance between fun and challenge.  Seeing each unique level is the fun.  Trying to get perfect scores is the challenge.
B004XKMEK2|5.0|Jennifer Lopez is a wonderfully talented young woman who inspires my family. Her music is at times a little too sexy, but the kids love it any ways.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game should be free. Some games are great, very time consuming, and hard. Others are boring and confusing. Im glad I bought it though because its it is dun to just sit down and play arcade games. I have seen better.
0393088774|4.0|Admittedly, I am somewhat sympathetic to this view point and am not completely objective. Nevertheless, I firmly believe even someone in the center or right who reads this with an open mind will agree that Krugman makes a persuasive case for more fiscal stimulus. Krugman argues that American politicians of both parties are wrongly focused on the national debt , which Krugman believes is not the priority right now. He believes the economy  suffers from a shortage of demand, which can be solved by more government spending, both nationaly and at the state level. Cleverly, he uses a famous economic anecdote, the baby-sitting co-op, to show how fiscal stimulus can end a depression. (Confused? Understandably, so, but trust me, if you read the book, you'll understand the last sentence).<br /><br />Krugman argues austerity measures (i.e. large,quick spending cuts), both here and Europe, will be counterproductive--they will actually increase the national debt by ruining the economy and reducing employment. He strongly refutes conservative objections to his plan, explaining why they don't make economic sense.<br /><br />This is a book that needs to be read by everyone, although I fear Krugman's reputation as a liberal polemicist (he writes a column for The New York Times)will discourage conservatives from reading it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Loved this book sooo much!!! I laughed and cried so much! It's the sweetest story I have ever read! I'm going to read sequel ASAP!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Too much reliance on making you buy what you need to improve your city. Credits go FAST and you have to spend too much real money to keep going.  Kind of a racket.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless<br /><br /><br /><br />This was an amazing true story about one of our country's warriors.  Adam Brown was a SEAL from SEAL team SIX.  He gave his life for his family, his team, and freedom.<br /><br />Adam made bad decisions as a late teen, and ended up getting himself addicted to drugs and making all the wrong decisions that go along with that.  He hurt himself, his friends, and his family constantly.  He would be clean for a few days, weeks, or months, and then he would be battling his demons again.  Eventually he realized he had to do something different, and the Navy helped him do that.  He did everything it took to make it as a SEAL and the book chronicles the journey.<br /><br />You will cry when you read the book, but it was an amazing journey.  I loved how it showed how Christ can turn life around for a man and his family, and even for our country.  Adam Brown - I look forward to meeting you.  Thank you for your service.<br /><br />I was given a free copy of the book for my review.  My views are my own.
B0074YVW1G|3.0|I couldn't read this much - love the writing  but the formatting on Kindle for iPad made me stop.  Footnotes are presented by underlining and in blue but it is the whole sentance or para.  I just couldnt keep reading it.  Will probably buy the hard copy and won't buy another book which has this footnoting approach (will check via page preview).  Amazon needs to allow this to be turned off.
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|I've never been a big fan of LP, but I've tracked their progress as I've been forced to listen to them on every medium over the last decade.  I will say that there are songs by them that I like.  Ultimately, it's Chester's nasally singing style that kills it for me.  Onto this album...I don't even know what to call it!  I sat an listened to each song so I could give it a fair review.  I give it 2 stars because at least they try to keep the music fresh, but I don't like techno/coffeehouse/synth.  If you like that type of stuff, then knock yourself out.  If you want some edge, this is not the place to be.
B004IFGORQ|4.0|Adam Sandler and his \\"friends\\" get it right again in a very entertaining and funny movie for the whole family.  Children and adults will enjoy it, and be quoting lines to each other for days.  I even got Skeeter's ringtone as my own now.
0984074422|5.0|I needed this book for school. I found it to be a great coffee table book when I was done with it. It's not one of those books that you want to sell back at the end of the semester.
B005LJITS0|4.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise.  Hadn't heard too much about it.  We really liked it.  Fast moving adventure.  Good story.  Made you feel good, with a few good laughs along the way.  What more can you ask for?
B001AQO46E|4.0|this is a fantastic film one of arnolds best it will look great on blu-ray i cant wait to add it to my collection of classics in good cases:)
B006PZBRCY|4.0|This movie was better than expected.  It's not just a geek robot movie.  If you don't like the beginning - be patient.  The writers are just doing a good job making you feel the way you're supposed to about the main character.  It gets better... a lot better!
B000W91RUG|5.0|This shows the inner stereotypes of the nerd. Which I found quite humorous, and telling of the show itself. I look forward to the rest of the series.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|This was a very good movie.  Our group was split on whether it was better than the original or not.  Holmes' cavelier attitude and the interrupted style of the original are put \\"on steroids\\" in this sequel.  Very entertaining, but you'll have to pay attention.  No talking during this one!  We liked it. (... but I like the original a little better).
B003WE9TU8|3.0|A different taken the zombie, viral apocalypse. looking back at it. Worth a read for a night of light entertaining reading.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is the best you should relly buy it. and it's free<br />unless you want to buy gems.its awsome
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|app has been a godsend until last week where I cant seem to link to my FB account.  any answers?
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game.....gives me something to do when I'm bored!!!! its feels like I'm really running my own restaurant ......so fun especially trying to unlock the next level.....try bakery story and nightclub story as well....you'll love going back and forth playing all three.
B00007E7K0|5.0|not much to say about the product only that it does the job to do.<br />i recommend it to evryone that has a camara vand lost the cover
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I am not a Mac geek so much of this book was tedious for me.  Jobs was a brilliant visionary but not a nice person.  Well written.
B001OMJGD0|1.0|This was the worst big-budget super-hero flick ever made. A total misunderstanding of the character by the writers, poor acting by the lead, no humor at all. Pretentious and dull.
B00479SVBU|5.0|The SoundflyAux works great! Sound is good. Easy to use. Nice features. I liked it so well, I bought two more for gifts. The quality of the construction of this device is high, not cheap flimsy plastic like some others. Just enough features with the menu and remote to make it easy to use without being too complicated. The screen is nice to display what is playing, help you navigate your folders and files and operate the device. The unit itself is attractive. In my Xterra plugged into my \\"Accessory Power Port\\" (cigarette lighter), it is in a very convenient place to see and operate. This was exactly what I was looking for.
B0086700CM|5.0|Easy to play, great graphics. Fills odd moments in between other things with some easy fun. I'm trying to get better as the game gets faster, but it doesn't really matter as the route changes from try to try.
