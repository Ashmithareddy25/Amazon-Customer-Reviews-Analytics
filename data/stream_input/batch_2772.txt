B00CZXIVNI|4.0|I bought this album for my 9 year old daughter. It was her first full album. We are having fun listening to it together. We also love the big time rush t_v show.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Plenty of action obliged with just enough technical gadgets. This will keep you awake. This movie is also filled with plenty of stars.
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|I really like Giacchino's Enterprise 'hero' theme, but I wish Giacchino would have incorporated some of Goldsmith's and/or Horner's memorable Trek musical phrases into his work.  Not too many, but just enough to have some musical 'continuity' between the old and the new Trek movies beyond the Courage TV theme.  If the next Star Trek movie ends up involving the Klingons in a more substantial way, it would great to hear Goldsmith's Klingon/Worf theme in the score.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Fun, just wish there wasnt a gimmick to earn more tokens and why am i required to write at least 20  words? Geez, its just a game. Either its fun to play or not
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|Even though you have to buy the 3.99 version to get the best app it was well worth the money.My granddaughter who is 5 loves it. The night I purchased it for her I had to make her turn it off at midnight and go to sleep. She loves playing hospital and wants to be a doctor and this app really kept her interested.
B000002LAC|5.0|I had this in cassette form but no longer have any cassette players.  I was ready to hear it again!
B004QPOVF0|5.0|if you're an ac/dc fan this is a no brainer. just seeing the MASSIVE crowd bounce up and down as one is spectacle enough for the price you pay.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I wasn't expecting to enjoy it, but it turned out to be pretty entertaining. Almost as good as Zombie Land.
030789701X|5.0|Son loves this book being hard cover it will last for a long time maps are amazing thank you Suz
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Challenging without being overwhelming. Pace was good. If I got stuck, there were enough hint opportunities to enable me to solve the problem. It was like starting a good book; I had a hard time putting it down - I wanted to just keep going to the end, and I'm not a regular game player! I will look for more such games from Neosoft.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its like they took temple run and made it hilarious! fun fun lots of fun. read it and weep. seriously why is it so difficult to leave a review
B0017SWPXY|4.0|A quick and fun read that may leave you crying happy/sad tears.  Good Dog, good read I recommend it as a quick read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Truly another masterpiece in the series. The author did an amazing job keeping my attention and the ending was a surprise.
030758836X|5.0|I didn't see the end coming, it's always nice to have the ending unfold in an unexpected way.  Good writing.
B0037WP83M|5.0|We watch this movie over and over again. This is such a great story and the music is wonderful.  The action keeps you moving and wanting to see what happens
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My whole family loves this game (12 and 13 year old kids) I enjoy it also. It did have a lot of rules and initially trying to figure out how to play the game was a little difficult. Then we found a youtube video that explained some of the things we weren't sure about. We should have just watched the video from the beginning. GREAT GAME!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|As soon as I finished reading it I applied it and things started changing. Your mind is a powerful thing . told all my friend sto read it!
B00005AQE8|5.0|2pac has done it again! I love listening to 2pac and am glad that I purchased another album of his. This may be his best album thus far and is vintage 2pac. I would recommend this album for those who love 2pac and his music.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I could not put it down and I applied it right away and things started happening! I told already all my friends to read it.The power of your mind is amazing!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Some of the challenges take quite a bit of thought, so I find it very entertaining &amp; at times challenging! Most of it is pretty easy, but it's a fun time waster!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is very well written The story is just amazing. The characters are heroic. I fell in love with this book and will definitely re-read it.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|He'll of a game. Just wish you guys had the option of cockpit view. Be sides that is a great game.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|When I first switched to Feedly after the announcement about the demise of Google Reader, I didn't like Feedly and figured I would just have to get used to it. But you guys at Feedly kept your word and listened to the people and I love it!  With all the changes you made, Ithink it's 10 times better than Reader ever was.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|Very touching story about conquering addiction with God, and moving upward and onward to  serve the USA at the highest level.
030758836X|5.0|Extremely interesting book.  It was well written and had some very unexpected twist.  Kept my attention.  Maybe since I am from Missouri I related to setting.  Highly recommend!  Looking forward to the movie!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm cute. Funny. Crazy. Wild. Chill af. I love meeting new people. I'm single, sadly.  Straight! Im 16 .. I'm very mature. I'm sexy (; add me and we'll go from there ((; I'll be glad to tell you all about myself.... guys only ... please. SEXY GUYS!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Works nice and has some good features. The whole weight thing is kinda gimmicky, but the mouse works good. The programmable buttons work well. I use it primarily for LoL but don't use the mouse buttons because its not worth it. If you have dreams of chaining spells together you'll find it easier just using the keyboard. It clicks well though which is what I really want when it comes to LoL. I ended up using the three side buttons for Mass Effect 3 and that worked great. It was much easier to use abilities on the mouse. If your looking for a good mouse then buy this one.
1936594234|4.0|I get what the author is saying about manifesting but it seemed a bit clinical and in a less spiritual light than how I view it. It would be great for someone who is interested in manifesting but doesn't want the spiritual stuff.
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|Love the  game but can't get it to sync the upgraded part I paid for on all of our Kindle linked to the same acct and refuse to purchase it for each kid. Not fair to them as it says you can do this!!
B00DI75SWM|4.0|These app really does help me keep calm!<br />Overall a great app.<br />But not totally worth the money.<br />If it was free I would be enjoying it a lot more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We enjoy this game because you have to think about how your next move will affect your next move and so on, like a cross word puzzle, every move affects the next. We have not been playing this game for very long but can say we will<br />be it is fun.It is not a slow paced game but you do have to think about what you doing .
B00APYKXFS|2.0|IT STARTED TO DOWN LOADED AND THEN IT SAYS APP ACOUNT HAS PROBLEMS PLEASE RE-DOWNLOAD, I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD SOMETHING MORE THAN ONCE RIGHT?
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The destruction and chaos is unrelenting, but medieval warfare was incredibly brutal and could go on for decades.<br /><br />Interest in the characters keeps me going. Some sort of character glossary would be useful, with hyperlinks between character names and their glossary entries.<br /><br />As far as all the descriptive detail goes, that is a matter of taste. For those who just want to know what happens next it must be trying. I think it gives the stories more depth.<br /><br />I am waiting impatiently to see how all the story lines get brought together in Winds of Winter.
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|This game is way too complicated. I never got the hang of it...I see other reviews about this game saying how fun and cool it is but I don't see how it is.
0987300911|3.0|The book is not thorough but I will say more when I have completed it. I have only just looked at it.
B0094M2X6Y|5.0|Kevin liked everthing and recommends it to everyone. He sees himself as a young virile paratrooper and he sees himself<br /><br />as having lost his love in the past.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have a lot of fun playing this usually while listening to the TV.  The ads are annoying but what do you expect when it's totally free?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's great. I love all the many great features and realism. Great game to play. It's fun for the whole family and everyone will enjoy it
0061339202|4.0|I haven´t finished the book but yes, i´m hooked. For those who need more technical or cientific explanations about FLOW, it´s really interesting. Those who are not contented with the spiritual aspect of it, will be convinced!
0061950726|4.0|I personally enjoy books that mix history and fiction.  Reading this book was enjoyable, sad and thrilling.  What an odd mix!  I loved the relationship between Molly and Vivian.  I was so sad reading about the orphan train, the lives the kids left behind and how they were treated in the new homes/lives and I didn't want to put it down to see how things turned out.<br /><br />Wonderful read!
0316789720|5.0|I love drawing those beautiful little things!! I really liked his drawing style and the way he guides to draw. Great to sharing it with kids!
0385344228|5.0|I have been \\"considering\\" this book for quite a while.  Meaning, I have considered reading this book many times and kept putting it back.  I don't know why, sometimes books come into our lives at the right time and all of the times I had looked at this book were not the best time for me.  Who knows?  But, finally I took the plunge and dove into this wonderful book.<br /><br />I can only say to anyone who hasn't read it, do it!  Pick this one up and enjoy!  I love the structure of the book, the back and forth, and I was thrilled with the unexpected twists and turns!  The book is also an emotional roller coaster, from a deep despair when Jacob is accused and the heart wrenching that the parents experience to the... SPOILER ALERT...the high of the charges being dropped and back down again when the next event happens.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading Mr. Landay's other novels!
B004LROUNG|5.0|This book was another great one from John Grisham !!! ... Both my wife and I read it and we share the same opinion.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Loved the first season! Although very disappointed to see two characters/story lines I was really into being ended so quickly! Looking forward to Season 2! Peter Dinklage is great!  Love the baby dragons!
B003U2SKS4|5.0|I love this trilogy! I cannot believe that Garth Nix never entertained the thought of keeping these characters alive and expanding the stories. A fantastic read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game and they love getting chased by the cop in the game.  I would recommend it.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This movie was sad but also great at the sametime! You really get to understand Nev and his life. By watching this movie you will understand Nevs show Catfish on MTV and know why he is so passionate about help these young people and why he is so quick to stick up for the ones that get hurt.
B005GVF95O|4.0|It is a fairly simple set of puzzles but for my little ones it is great.  They find it themselves and play it for hours on end.
B00BPEWNZU|5.0|Zeppelin, Black Keys, Animals, all rolled into one. Best rock cd this year. Great vocals, great guitar, great songs....I you like rock n' roll get this!
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I really like Atlantis.  A good cheesy sci fi show with humor and wit.  Wish there were more like it being made now!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Even though there is a new companion to the Doctor, she is excellent at balancing his character without the romantic component.  Well done!
0099519852|5.0|Dear Robert Forbes-roberts,<br /><br />My 16 year-old son asked me to purchase this book as suggested by his football coach. I've seen my son work hard over the summer utilizing a program called SEALS, Specialized Educational Approach to Learning Success. I haven't purchased the book yet, and I don't think $12-13 bucks will set me back too much to give the kid another tool in his toolbox in pursuit of a starting role on a great football squad. But, after reading your pompous-ass waste of server space, I am ordering it right away. You sound like a pusillanimous oboe player who missed the cut for the big show. You're also a guy using a hyphenated last name. I suggest you drop one and keep practicing your reed instrument.<br />I don't have credentials or anything, I studied some kinesiology in college. We had a \\"dumbed down\\" term for practice called \\"groovin the stroke.\\" You know, like Michael Jordan shooting 10,000 free-throws a day to become, er, Michael Jordan. I really wish you hadn't been so full of yourself and long-winded. Too many sheeple gave you a thumbs up on your meanness. I for one voted it non-helpful for the simple reason that you come off like a jerk.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|That inevitably loses it's energy after the waves recede.  I understand this is a true story, but the initial struggle of the mother and oldest son was so compelling I couldn't help but feel bored at the hospital.  There are too many handheld and wide shots of strangers just laying or standing.  The film gives it's most dramatic secrets away too quickly.
0765325950|1.0|Just not up to par. Ryan Sanderson wrote two great novels to revive the franchise, but this last one stunk. In a word: Boring. I found myself skipping whole segments just to finish it. It was almost as bad as GRR Martin's Clash of Kings. Actually, it might have been worse. I very infrequently read books where I keep saying in my mind, \\"who gives a crap about this anymore,\\" but that's what happened during this one.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Getting all the movies together at a good price for my daughter allows her to watch these movies when she wants and in any order.  She really has enjoyed this set.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Such a different movie.  I liked it a lot.  I think it Is good for all ages since I am 60.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|This film combined a bit of everything I like in a movie: comedy, action with surprises (if somewhat predictable). The cast pulls it off and I love the addition of a female as part of their team. Malkovich is hilarious, Willis is his usual dry self and Helen Mirren an absolute delight!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Understanding the body's chemistry, while debunking 50 years of bad medical info, can put you on the path to a healthy weight.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I can't find the words to adequately describe how much I enjoyed this book!  It captured my full attention from the very start and was a delightful read!
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|UPDATE - after a few days of somewhat frustrating emails Withings customer support came through and shipped me two pulse replacements which so far work and installed with no trouble... so... all is well that ends well, now a happy customer that recommends the Pulse. So long as you get a good one<br /><br />----below is my original review which I leave unedited as I think it is still helpful---<br /><br />I ordered 2 of these based on my experience with their body composition scale which outstanding. BIG MISTAKE. while the features are very promising the product just isn't ready for the market and neither is their tech support.<br /><br />1- Pulse requires a droid or Iphone. IT ONLY communicates through either and by Bluetooth only, including firmware upgrades<br />2- Setup is also through BT.<br />3- First unit took 4 tries before it connected and upgraded its firmware but, no matter how long it charges the display goes dim less then 5 minutes off the charger, even though the phone app says Pulse is charged 100%. obviously this makes impossible to use it.<br />4- Second unit just hangs about a third of the way through the firmware upgrade.<br />5- Tech support is apparently by email only and vague at best...<br /><br />both going back tomorrow if I get no response to my last email by tonight
B0098G7AWS|5.0|No matter how many times I've watched this movie it has the same effect everytime.  For the first time my two kids watched it with me and they totally loved it too, at 6 & 7 Years the loved every minute of it.  My son loved the part where it broke a part and sunk and my daughter loved when Rose who was telling the story threw the diamond necklace in the ocean on the end.  Loved it
B006LSZECO|1.0|I didn't like it at all, skipped parts of it.  Didn't care for the writing style, disjointed, weak plot, can't understand why it was on the best seller list.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was very skeptical about this book before I read it because honestly the concept seemed kind of depressing. However, I gave into the hype of this story and absolutely fell in love. These characters are flawless and the story, as sad as it is, is also extremely happy. It's defiantly worth reading regardless of your age, its a love story that will steal anyones heart.
0425263916|5.0|I enjoyed the series. It is a very messed up and intense relationship but this is why I love it!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I loved this! I had no idea it would be as good as it was. I found myself looking forward to one scene after another. Tim Robbins was fantastic and Morgan freeman, again, can't be beat. The ending was GREAT!
0425263908|5.0|Good read and steamy scenes at least in my head they were pretty steamy! I can't wait to get the rest!
B0007LXPBI|5.0|The older version and this new adaptation are awsome, both are great. I like Ms Lohan in this movie as well as all other Disney Movies that she was in. Just wish there were more. Just hope this movie will come out on Blue-Ray someday....
0553801473|3.0|I should say I would give this 3.5 stars.<br /><br />I thought it was good. It did get a little slow and I felt that some of the storylines ended abruptly. . Jon's storyline for example ends with a dramatic cliffhanger that makes you want to read the next book to see what happens next. Danery's plot line just suddenly ends. I thought several of the plotlines went on way too long.Jon's plotline for example I think could have been condensed a lot more. It seemed like 2 or 3 of his chapters could have been combined into one.And Danerys just sits around talking and doing noting for several chapters.It gets really boring. It also seems that for the first 3/4 of the book very little happens.I understand that the series is supposed to go 7 books and the middle books are building up to what happens in book seven. I told my friend at work I thought it was moving too slow when I was halfway finished. He told me &#34;Well, that's Martin for you. Keep reading. It gets better.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|I bought this album because I already knew I loved it.  My main problem is that it is the \\"CLEAN\\" version which makes me pretty angry.  I don't read anywhere that is specified.  I would never buy a clean album on purpose and considering there's a warning label on it, I feel that this clean album is misleading.<br /><br />I'd otherwise give this album five stars but clean it's not worth a penny to me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is like so fun. I play it everywhere! Even on the toilet! You can zipline and do so much more! I guarantee you'll love this game!<br />Bixby fresh!
B004HWYTP4|1.0|The playback quality wasn't up to the usual Amazon quality. The picture was grainy and stopped multiple times during playback. I did a Speedtest.net check on my system afterward as I had never had a problem and my download speed checked fine so it must have been an Amazon problem. It was frustrating with the poor quality but we did get through the movie.
B000OY8NII|5.0|Love the show, but the discs fall out whenever the package/folder is opened. Otherwise, very happy with this product. Thanks
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|Plug one end into the computer, the other into the dvi cable. Can't be more simple than that. I received a genuine Apple adapter and works perfectly. I wanted to get only an Apple adapter because I've had bad luck with adapters from third parties.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|If you enjoy seeing cities destroyed, total lack of concern for people, structures or civility this is a movie for you.<br />I did enjoy much of the movie. probably because of Robert Downey Jr, his antics and personality are very entertaining and he pulls the whole super  hero rich guy off very well.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Very nice scenery, moderately challenging, no glitches on Kindle Fire HD. Well worth the dollar price and good for teaching my 5yr old distance judgement.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Loved the book and really enjoy McConaughey's acting. If you have read the book I think you will find this follows very close to the wit and essences of the character found there as well as the story. If not, after seeing this movie you might want to consider checking the book out.<br />The pace is fast, the tension is just right, the characters play on each other so well. This is a great movie and I would recommend anyone who enjoys detective, crime, comedy etc take a look at it.
B00BN0Y4JY|1.0|It did not give you a diet!  It talks more about why other diets don't work!  I would send it back, but it is too much trouble!
B000J103OI|5.0|A good story and showcase for a good cast. I am now writing jibberish  so that the web-site will let me post my thoughts.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|My daughter's iphones volume no longer works. The apple store said it is due to water damage. Waiting to hear back from lifeproof.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|I especially like the &#34;theatrical&#34; version. I don't understand why producers need to put extra versions on a DVD. I suppose they are enamored with the &#34;new&#34; medium.
1419705644|5.0|This book contains Information on most of the main characters and locations from the show. It mostly includes information from the show but it does provide information  that hasn't been shown and miscellaneous factoids. The book is written from the point of view of Hunson Aberdeer (AKA Marceline's Dad) and its hilariously in character. Finn, Jake and Marceline right in their commentary of his cynical retelling of information. It's a good book for even casual fans of the show  to buff up on their Adventure Time know-how or long time fans to scrutinized over the new information about their favorites.  I hope there is another with expanded information on some of the recurring characters as the biographies only focus on the main cast. Biographies on Flame Princess, Tree Trunks, Billy, The Lich and some of the other Princesses would be Rad. Still doesn't lesson the value of this humorous guided tour through OOO.
B0026S1XD2|4.0|A very interesting presentation of a &#34;new&#34; form of music. Now I am writing junk so I can meet the minimum requirement.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|Always a classic! I've never met anyone who didn't enjoy this movie, and if i ever did I may have a hard time being friends with them!
6304711905|5.0|Good movie. Very good casting and acting. The sets are well done along with the setting, acting, and chatting to make the minimum words required.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|It's not a bad book, but it is far far away from a 5 stars. The character are flat and constantly sound phony,  the plot as a whole sound cheap, specially in the second half of the book. It's entertaining and in a some moments touching but I finished it feeling like it was a good idea done badly.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|A superb game with classic patterns of a outrageous siege defense game. With a full and interactive world with a heck of a army to train and upgrade as you wish. Thank you Gameloft for proportionate tons of fun with your games
B0049J2CKE|5.0|This movie is great for adults and children.  A funny family movie!  I highly recommend it to you and your family!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I think the reviews are mixed because this movie has a very target audience. There are things that I laughed out loud at that no regular person would laugh at. When paul rudd said he would kill his choose a wood chipper to kill his wife.... Omg. I laughed for ever. Paul rudd always has good music choices so you can expect that. And judd apatows wife always reminds me of my own, or any female, illogical and hard to please. If you are strong right wing baptist your probably not going to like this movie. There is alot of kids cussing and sex scenes. But its like real life. Kids are going cuss....
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Perhaps that is the life these people have.  How sad for them!  I don't think I could live my whole life like that
B00452VF4O|5.0|Beautiful, sweeping, heart-wrenching. Ms. Penman has commented on her love for writing about people who lived unlikely lives and the Welsh Princes trilogy brings this to life with color, depth, great clarity and attention to historical detail. This trilogy has easily become one of my favorite sets of books of all time and completely changed my opinion on historical fiction novels. I found Ms. Penman's devotion to accuracy the most compelling aspect of her work. At the heart of this trilogy is the epic struggle of Middle Ages Wales to have an independence from the English Crown, a dream never realized. During the 12th and 13th centuries this dream was kindled to legendary proportions in the great Welsh princes Llewelyn the Great and his grandson Llewelyn the Last taking the dream to heights never before thought possible, and since has never been renewed. Generally I read mostly non-fiction and have found few novels that really hold my attention and even fewer that I am eager to reread, yet I read 'Here Be Dragons' and promptly started it over again. 'Here Be Dragons' is easily my favorite of the three books, so compelling is the reign of King John and the long shadow he cast over the love story of Joanna and Llewelyn Fawr. The chronicles of history are full of men and women who lived unlikely lives, and Ms. Penman has done a masterful job of bringing to life the highborn men and women of Middle Ages Wales and England.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is a bit challenging and worth having if you enjoy a bit of mystery. You have events to complete and new things to find. The only thing I done care for is that all your food items have to be bought with diamonds. At least make a cup of coffee/tea and a muffin or bagel possible to get with regular coins. They don't have to replenish that much of your energy, but at least a little. That's all I ask, give the player an option to get a little energy with regular coins, not just diamonds.
031237593X|5.0|This book changed my opinion on historical fiction. I absolutely hoe depth of character development and richness of romance and adventure are woven together with a devotion to accuracy. Richard III is a much debated man, and anyone who conjures such debate must be incredibly complex and Ms. Penman does an excellent job of bringing these layers to life.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|it would be better if there were more hints, or another way to accumulate them. If you're not familiar,  hints would help
B00026WU82|5.0|Great music at a great price. I would use this service again if possible in the future. Thanks for all the great selections.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|If you like any dance pop songs, than you will LOVE Selena's new album \\"Stars Dance\\"! It's filled with many great songs with nice, uptempo, uplifting beats...not to mention Selena's amazing vocals. This album definately deserves to be #1 for many, many months. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!<br /><br />P.S. Make sure to download the 2 or 3 bonus tracks that aren't on the physical album but only available on the downloaded version, as they are great tracks as well!
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Finally in August I will visit my first concert in Detroit. YEAH!!!!<br />So I bought this new album. It's different to there famoust hits in the 80's and 90's. But it must not missing in a collection.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Good, but not as stimulating sound-wise (maybe a bad mix) than Coming from Reality. The band and Rodriquez sound more muted, not right on the mikes.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love tis game I play in all the time more peeps should rate 5 stars have a Facebook account.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Before I got this, I could not access my gmail accounts, only yahoo. With this, it is fast, and convenient. I'm quite pleased!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have followed this series for years.  ALthough this is not her best book in the series, I still say this is my favorite series.  I am really happy with the ending.  This is a series that I will re-read time and time again.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love love love the feel of this cover. Not only does it protect the Kindle but it also has such a smooth touch to it and makes holding the kindle so much easier. Def recomment it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever and Skyfall is the best Bond movie ever - what else is there to say!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I am reading the 4 books by Philipa Gregory in the Cousins War.  It is so interesting to read the same time period, same situations and dramas by 4 different perspectives.  It's all historically interesting and I feel so much more enlightened by reading these books.  Very entertaining and education at the same time
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|In the early chapters of this book i was so sure i knew who the culprit was...and then there was a plot twist...and another plot twist...and many, many more.  This is definitely NOT a cozy mystery.  You will not be able to (nor will you want to) skip parts of the text for fear of missing part of some character's development or a clue to the solution.  I am looking forward to subsequent Harry Hole mysteries but I think I'll take a break first and quietly digest this first one.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Wasn't a big fan of the book.  I thought there were a lot of facts and parts that didn't need to be in the book, making it some times a bit tedious.  Good story premise.
B00ALCBTWU|5.0|Good old WWII Movie with lots of action. A good movie for any ones collection. Of course I play thr game of the same name.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Great game. Challenging puzzles and hidden objects. Nice that it wasn't too short. Hints were helpful without giving it all away. Will definitely get part two.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|So sad what the children had to go though in the orphanage! Would of liked the book to go on longer. But was happy in the out come.
B004TMPJP6|3.0|The program has great potential and when it is working, it does well, but that's only 50% of the time. Updates always have errors.
0394800192|5.0|Great words and rhymes in this book.  It's fun to read.  When we first got this it was read over and over and over again.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am not a huge fan of hidden object games usually.  However, this one has so much variety and I enjoy playing it very much.
B000FC130E|4.0|This is the first work from Neil Gaiman that I've ever read, so I didn't really have a good idea of what to expect. Neverwhere had me hooked from the start. Richard saves a young girl who comes tumbling out of a door that appears from nowhere and finds himself thrust into an entirely new world called London Below. London Below takes its cues from London Above (or is it the other way around?), where Earl's Court is a stop on the Tube in London Above, it is actually a darkened train car containing an Earl and his Court. The fanciful imaginative world of London Below, despite its darker twists, is a great escape for readers, especially if you've ever gotten into the drab routine of going to work in a city, reinterpreting it in the context of Neverwhere is a fun exercise.<br /><br />Richard, once he saves the young girl, Door, finds his fate entwined with hers as she sets out on a quest (with a few other characters in tow) to find why her family was killed. A highly respected member of the feudal states existing in London Below, Door is able to meet with and interact with many members of this strange society, acting as a liaison for defenseless and often seemingly witless Richard. As in most stories, these meetings and experiences change Richard in ways that will often surprise himself (though not necessarily readers). For me, the Marquis de Carabas, a sort of middle man and ultimately a companion to Door, steals the show. Scenes with him are often lively and entertaining, and his more devilish characteristics help balance out Door and Richard, who can seem too good-natured.<br /><br />At times it seems Gaiman could have delved more into the world of London Below and how it functions. Sometimes exciting bits are hinted at, but then never elaborated on. At other times, characters can seem to be cardboard cut outs. Silent but serious action girl extraordinaire, Hunter, functions as Door's bodyguard, but the reader doesn't really get to know her. Also, the ending can be abit of a let-down. The book starts with a lot of promise, an exciting world, a quest, a motley crew thrown in together, a mysterious last message, strange abilities, but as it wraps up, it feels like it doesn't quite live up to all it could have been. But perhaps it's to the authors credit that so many details prodded my imagination onwards. I think this is a universe Gaiman could return to and elaborate on with great success. There are always other doors and other worlds to explore.
B00D3XAA4M|3.0|There is only minimal info in this book but still reasonably informative. But then what does one expect when the book is free.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is the kind of book you can't put down.  You want to read it all, but you also don't like it at times.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Its hard but a good game really gets u thinking about what your doing i love it its just great
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book shows the progress of Alzheimer's from the inside of a person's emotions.  It is a little scary and very sad.  I would recommend it for anyone who is seeing the changes that happen to someone you love.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Good game using only two suits.  I'm running better than 45% win rate keeps my mind working at top notch
B004YKSXYW|5.0|This is great for any age and brings out many interesting and little known details about major historical events. It can be picked up and put down as desired (it took me several months to complete it in this fashion) without having to refresh your memory! It definitely would peak the interest of young people and hopefully cause them to approach their history classes with more enthusiasm.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is addicting and fun to play. The best game ever!!!! I reccomend his game to anyone who loves addicting, mysterious games
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This, too, I got for my son to be 5 year old. She has a wonderful time playing this game. She's so focused and intense. I also have a 2 year old nephew who can play this game, too. Much better than I expected.
140006922X|5.0|By Paul Kowalewski:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />\\"....The Buddha taught that we deceive ourselves by clinging to the illusion that the individual person is a separated, isolated self, when all beings actually are in a dynamic interrelationship. The true self is a relationship. ....<br /><br />Jesus, like the Buddha, was also radical and revolutionary in what he taught and in what he did. Jesus, like the Buddha, also taught his disciples that to find your \\"true self,\\" you had to die to your old self; you had to surrender your ego to find your genuine nature. ......<br />In his recently popularized book, Reza Aslan refers to the historical Jesus as a \\"Zealot\\" - a social prophet who led a revolutionary movement against Roman oppression and domination and was ultimately crucified for his crime of sedition against the state. While Aslan is hardly the first scholar to suggest this, I think he is probably quite accurate....\\"
B004NJW96C|5.0|I love to get different types of music for background music while painting in my studio. Moby can hit the spot with his rhythmic music. he has not let me down yet.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I read this book on the recommendation from a friend. In the early going I found it fascinating and an excellent read. In several characters there was too much to believe could be contained in one personality. The historical detail was quite good. The male characters were much more shallow than the women. I didn't like some of the incredible coincidences the author crafted but that's what fiction is all about. Three stars is all I can give.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|love this soundtrack. I have it playing in my studio while painting. it is something different. it has three disks hours of music. check it out I liked it.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|This show started out strong and interesting, but seems to occasionally get bogged down but the main arch.  Tries to hard to have a stand alone bad guy and progress the big arch in every episode.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great read, even after watching the show.<br />Alot of stuff they couldn't show on the show.<br />I would recomend it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched this show when it was on TV before the shortsighted idiots at Fox programming cancelled it after one season.  This package includes previously unaired episodes.  A must-have for Joss Whedon fans.  I guess the problem Fox had was deciding what genre the show was.  It's a space western with fun story lines and a fantastic cast.  For &#34;Castle&#34; fans, it's fun to see a really young Nathan Fillion,  In the halloween episode of the first season of &#34;Castle,&#34; Richard Castle's halloween costume is the costume he wore as Malcom Reynolds in &#34;Firefly&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I cannot put my tablet down! I'm in love with this game! And now my whole family is playing it and getting addicted!:)
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I love this movie.  The series &#34;Firefly&#34; was cancelled by idiots at Fox and this was a nice way to give back to the fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Get subway surfers for free!!! You will not be sorry after purchasing this app for free!!! It's so much fun running around on trains and doing mission's and doing a daily word hunt!!! Really... stop what you are doing and get this app!!! Trust me, you will be saying thanks to me after you get this app because it is so out of this world AMAZING!!!
B002KLOPF8|5.0|I can't believe this movie is so old.... And it still looks so good, almost like it was made this decade.<br /><br />Mildly disturbing.. Definitely not a check flick.<br /><br />This movie was made for dudes by a dude.
B0084FB8OU|5.0|This book is really good since there is two people telling the story with their different perspectives.<br /><br />I would definetly recommend this book to a friend that is for gay rights and im actually thinking of buying a copy for her birthday :)<br /><br />If you are looking for a love story that is not tooooo cheesy then this book is definetly what you are looking for :)
B00BPEJXTY|5.0|I cant wait until this movie comes out I wanna know who the 3rd monster is and if the giant bug is mothra, either way im still gonna say its mothra, and I cant wait to see another Godzilla movie
B0090SI582|3.0|The previous Wolverine movie clearly shown that Wolverine has a past that we cannot remember anymore (remember? with that bullet being shot into his head towards the end of the last Wolverine movie, he forgotten the woman that he loved). Wolverine should only have memory after that episode.  And why in this latest movie, he could remember Yashida and also his past in WWII Japan?? Funny!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this series however this one is left so open ended that i am kind of angry and want to know the exact release date of the next one.... i thought this was a trilogy but i was mistaken and now i will have to try to remember the story ..... this book even seemed to repeat too much  from the other books that if you had read the other two was already known ..... still hot and steamy  and almost seems like a happy ending is coming or so i hope but have some lingering questions about some of the characters .... we shall see what happens next
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Loved the movie even knowing it was a dramatic recreation and not a documentary. Very believable and I will never travel anywhere there is even a remote possibility of a tsunami.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Excellent classic movie. Three excellent actors that will keep you on the edge of your seat through the entire movie
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|Tom Keifer is the main singer, songwriter, and lead guitar player of the group Cinderella. Back in the day, they got grouped with the Hair Metal bands, although their music was somewhat bluesier with a lot of Stones type swagger. All of their studio albums are top notch, if you enjoy that sort of music. Keifer left the spotlight not so much as his popularity faded, but that he had severe throat problems, and was pretty much unable to perform for a decade and a half. Now, with the health problems behind him, he returns with a rocking, yet slightly more mature version of his style of music. This cd is as good as anything he has ever done, which is very good indeed.<br /><br />I recommend this to fans of blues rock, like the Rolling Stones, the Faces, or AC/DC.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|I really wanted to know what was going to happen next in this book.  It's a cross between Gone Girl and The Sixth Sense.  I really Liked it and highly recommend especially for travel as it's easy to get right into and a quick read.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Very nice album and Vince does a fantastic job.  The tribute to Merle and Buck's music is just amazing.  Love it..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!! When ever I start, I can't seem to stop. I would definitely recommend this for any temple run lovers. This game can kill time faster than you can blink. At first you start out going slowly, but the farther you run, the faster it gets. And I love how it does a world tour. I started out in New York but am now in Beijing. Fun for the whole family. A must get.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Hard to find but a little expensive !! But you have to do what you have to do when you need it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I love this series, but this book was so boring compared to the last two.  It picked up towards the end but wondering where the story going now. Feeling mixed.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Love it, easy to play the fun keeps coming with each game, challenging and addicting at times, love ithe challlenge
B005V20JKI|1.0|This used to be a fun game but this latest update ruined it by putting a level cap and character lock unless you pay up $$$.<br /><br />I'm uninstalling it now and I don't recommend this game at all anymore.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|A old family game that I love and continue to love and play. Each game is unique and you never know if your going to win or lose
0470913029|5.0|This book has helped me on my weight loss journey, and also on my healthy lifestyle change.  It is awesome!
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Atmospheric soundtrack, really fun gameplay, look a great on the hd screen!!! First got this game on ma phone, looks way better on kindle fire. I'm thinking of getting th  bigger fire. I'm sure it would look great on it too??
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is an exceptionally entertaining show. Very good character development, good stories and excellent dialog. It is well worth the time. I don't want give any spoilers, so I won't say more. Enjoy!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I do not agree with some of the ratings, but some I do. I love playing games with a story, but I try to read some things and there gone before I am done reading. Then there are other seans that the reading just stays so much longer and you have to wait. They need to time this better. I also had problems with trying to match the symbols, you have to do it over and over again till it works.  Hint about  saving your game, you have to finish the chapter and then your game will be saved.  Other wise I liked the game.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I love this movie and watch it even when Christmas is far away. Great message and great performances by the people and the Muppets!!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|It portrays the beginning of the twentieth century using well documented historical background sets and painstakingly collected and recreated artifacts; immerses the viewer into the saga of an aristocratic family's struggle to understand and come to terms with the changes brought to the world by WWI.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is great for kids and remains challenging enough to keep them engaged without violence. Glad that there are still games appropriate for kids.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the most beautiful and captivating games I have had the pleasure to experience. I can't wait for more rooms!
B0060BHUXI|5.0|they are a phenomenal group this is awesome I really enjoy itone of the better ones that I have listened to for this style of music fantastic
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another great job of mixing history with fiction and action. If you like James Rollins books you&#34;ll love this one
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|What can I say? Nothing really good here. Some shock value I suppose. Poor script and direction. Don't blame the actors.They did what they could.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|My cats try to be the t-rex.<br />couldn't love it any better then that.<br />it's a must see for all.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like knowing how the weather is going be for the DAY; and this App. will help you too.  Get it you will use it more than you think.
0385349947|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's inspirational from a realistic point of view. Great for any woman concerned about work-family balance, and getting far in their career.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey itself is an amazing gaming experience, and the other two are just icing on the cake. If you are thinking about getting Journey, get this bundle, you won't regret it
B008476HBM|5.0|I loved the book but I was already a fan. I have seen many versions of this book in films with many different actors and liked them all. Some more than others but loved the different interpretations of each one. I like  to go back and read the book myself every so often to keep the authors original vision in my head as I watch some of the film versions. I almost always like the authors vision the best and don't like actors to stray from it. As many  times as I read the book each time I see something new in it or find something I had forgotten about in the story line. A good book can be enjoyed over and over. You know where the story starts and where it ends but you get to enjoy the journey thru the book each time you read it. At least I do....hope you will too.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This device did exactly what I needed it to do.  I went through thousands of slides relatively quickly and scanned only the ones worth saving.  I then sent it to my sister who will use it for the same thing and will send it on to another friend when she's finished.  This is a great tool but, of course, once the slides are finished I really won't have a use for it anymore.  Certainly cheaper than sending them out to be done and when multiple people can utilize it...it's all good!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Fast shipping. Excellent quality item! Will recommend to others for sure. By today's standards, to read a &#34;based on a true story&#34; moniker in front of a movie trailer or the movie itself can be very misleading. Still, Steven Spielberg threw a 1-2 punch in 1993 with Jurassic Park and Schindler's List. This movie is fantastic, powerful and heartbreaking. It should be watched by many if not all so that attrocities such as this, never happen again.
B00BIPMGD0|5.0|The acting team on The Good Wife is superb and pulls of a very believable performance. It's nice to see a T.V. show that isn't using lewd humour or sex to get ratings.
B007N31XTY|5.0|Fast shipping. Excellent quality item! Will recommend to others for sure. With expectations through the roof, at the time it was impossible so quench fan's thirst for another thrill ride like the Lord of The Rings trilogy. Still, this movie is a very entertaining ride worth taking.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|A little predictable, not one of his better stories. Reminded me of different parts of the different books Sparks has written. Transplant part seem like it was kind of an &#34;oh well&#34; thing to Amanda
B00B4804KS|5.0|Fast shipping. Excellent quality item! Will recommend to others for sure. Steven Spielberg knocked it out of the park with this movie. The 3D is superb. Almost on par with Avatar.
1401907725|5.0|When my feelings were powerful and my emotions run high and my need is great I pull out this deck and it seems that something is always near to guide me through these cards.  I get the answers I need.
B006VZS1EA|5.0|Late elementary and up will enjoy this story of a father and son reunited. Yes, the father has to grow up, and the son teaches him a lot, but it's a great popcorn movie for all.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|5 stars and no more word for this album<br />black subbath, black metal, forever<br /> I like sound of guitar by Tony Iommy
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is the best book i have ever read Period..Adam Brown excels against all odds to become one of the greatest Navy seals to ever live.<br />Its a must read, I guarantee you will have a hard time putting the book down. Buy it you WILL not regret it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Awesome game for all ages! Takes a bit to load and I lost all my data because  it froze once. Overall, challenging and fun
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love it.....like the ability to copy from other sources and I have unlimited access to get familiar with the app
B00E0S52K6|5.0|One of his best albums in years, awesome rockin' blues, also great guests playing with him, Love this album !!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It started a bit slow but by the end I could not put it down. Time to get  50 shades darker!
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|One of the most touching movies I have ever seen. The power of love in this movie is beautiful. What a classic.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|just uninstalled app. new version hard to navigate. also it took several tries for it to load. please bring back the old version!
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Having seen the lord of the ring for 100 times had lots of expectation that Mr Jackson has don it again, but far from it. Just happy did not pay to see it at the movie theater .
0321857895|5.0|I have bought other books of other authors about sketching/graphic recording stuff and this is the best book of them. Concise, Clear, Well design and really focused on teaching you how to sketch, with exercises, examples,...<br />Also is full of tricks and tips about the material that the author uses ,etc... So, I you are interested in learning on in a real book about sketching buy this one :)
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved this story. So much good came from all this tragedy and brought these two together. So sweet and surprising at the same time
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mr. Hosseini's previous two offerings may also be on my best seller list.  And, as a semi-retired English teacher I have read a few books over the course of my 79 years!  I particularly appreciate the author's expertise in interweaving the stories of the various and varied characters as well as recounting the resilient but tragic history of Afghanistan over the span of many decades.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|While I love the Beach Boys, they don't quite sound the same as in the 60's.  It was still a great CD!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty c ool game gets harder as you go, some levels are very time consuming,but challenging and keeps you playing for the long time.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great memories of hot summer days and sleep over Friday's playing for hours! Then memories of my children loving the same game I did!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The world created in this book is amazing, and the characters are very likable, and the action is simply amazing. Highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like a fast paces game then this game is for you. Just be careful and don't hit anything! Very cute game.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is great for my childs kindle. it keeps her occupied and fills the time while we're travelling and at home

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Jamie, great book it so good. I love the roller coaster relationship. I'm glad they stop fight each other and work out their differences.
B003TO5414|5.0|This is a great interpretation of Sherlock Holmes! I love the intensity mixed with humor. I would gladly recommend this to my friends.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  Fun and challenging but not to hard.  Enjoyable.  My son and I are playing it on kindle fires to see who does better, so far he is.  Great game with a twist.  Not your ordinary item search game..
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|This seemed like an okay puzzle app at first.  Once you get past a couple of chapters, though, they just keep reusing the exact same puzzles over and over again, just making them bigger so that they'll take longer, but there isn't really any challenge to figuring them out after the first time you see them.  There are plenty of puzzles out there that they could have never repeated a single puzzle without even having to really make up their own.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|If you like angry birdss then try this game you would not be disappointed with this game it is for d
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Really pretty and interesting little tablet game.  It took  very little time to actually get through the entire game (the only reason I'm not giving it five stars), but had an interesting mix of puzzle boxes to work through.  I'm looking forward to the next one.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry birds is awesome 100 percent I would recommended it to any one. It is fun.  Kids would love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for people who want to take care of a realistic horse but don't own one so this is a great app.
B005VPRETE|3.0|AT LAST, Legos girls will want to play with!<br /><br />No, I haven't bought it yet, but I will be the next time I have a birthday/Christmas occasion for a girl.<br /><br />As a Mom of 3 daughters, I bought Legos in the Native American/Safari Explorer/Merry Men in the Forest/Space Exploration themes, and they loved building the sets but the accessories & story lines were always about shooting villains who were trying to steal some kind of magic gem. Now that I have grandsons, so much of the Lego is licensed (their mother prohibits) or all about shooting, war, etc that there is still not much choice other than the City line, and until these Friends came along, nothing for girls.<br /><br />My daughters would put their noses up at the more complex & challenging, and creative, Lego sets because they made weapons or the story line was about flying around fast & blowing something up.  We wanted them to have the experience of a toy that challenged their motor skills, eye hand coordination, and introduced engineering concepts during play.<br /><br />The \\"pink\\" aisle in TRU does not have any of that, of course.<br /><br />I hope that Lego notes the complaints that these blocks do not fit together as well as \\"regular\\" Lego -- I do hope they are not dissing girls once more as they did with that hideous Belleville stuff some years back---and keeps up the good start.  There is nothing wrong with girls wanting a building toy that reflects their interests, which are heavily weighted towards building relationships and social interactions, and at the same time challenging & developing their fine  motor and eye hand coordination. Pink & purple & kitty cats can be included in a toy that gives excellent mechanical challenges and introduces engineering concepts.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl was a real disappointment. The main character was a real drag.  I didn't like the ending.  Pure and simple!!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My son gave it to my daughter for her 18th birthday, and she loves it! Those who know the Doctor love it when they see it. The rest of the world hasn't a clue.
0790729342|5.0|It is nice to know that I can still obtain the older movies. I hear that a new Mad Max is coming out next year!
B000001ESN|4.0|I bought this cd as a present for my boyfriend. He absolutely loves the cd, however when I received the cd the case was cracked and broken....
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|I saw this advertised on you-tube. I'm glad I found this online. It is nice to repurpose my glass bottles.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I heard all the hype and started watching the show together. We enjoy it, and it has become one of our favorite shows. Highly recommend.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great book, only 80% through it, but it a great read.  Seem to answer a lot of questions I have always had.  It also supports the faith that I have in the after life.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|I thought I was downloading this for my grandkids.  I decided to try it so I knew how it worked to help them out.  I have been playing it ever since.  Good way to develop strategy.  It takes a little while to learn how to control the rabbits using the pause, stop and recharge keys, but once you do, the game is more rewarding.  It will be interesting to see the level my grandkids can reach.  This is the best game I have played so far.  Get it, you will be glad you did.

B002JXK5VU|5.0|This is the perfect show to me.  The cast are all wonderful, and the writing is clever.  I've watched every episode of every season multiple times and I still enjoy it.  Just hearing the theme music makes me smile.  Highly recommend giving this show a chance if you haven't before.

B000VD5I94|4.0|The effects are the same but the quality is so much better.  Not to mention the sound.  with the right system you think your in the theatre
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Yes, it's odd controlling this thing with no remote, but it works as advertised. I'd like to see more apps supported, but that's life on the bleeding edge. As for the device, YouTube and Netflix work flawlessly from the phone. Chrome tab casting, on the other hand,is too slow to use in its current from. Good start.
B004LWZW42|4.0|I think they tried to go somewhere and never made it, could have been a better plot.  Quality of the dvd is a+
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was laid up after surgery and looking for something to watch on my KINDLE FIRE. I came across this awesome series that I could download for free as a prime user of Amazon. I watched all 3 seasons and am looking forward to Season 4.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|the quality of the blu RAY was as expected, the movie plot could have been so much better.  lets hope the writters put thier heads together next time
B00C061I3K|5.0|When I signed up for my new cell phone service, I subscribed to a streaming music service.  One day on the radio I heard the first single off the album and said \\"That's kind of catchy\\".  This is from a guy who listens pretty much exclusively to metal, mind you.  So, I ended up listening to the album through my phone, and have been hooked ever since.  There's not a song on this album that I don't like.  It's opened up a whole new genre of music that I really hadn't paid much attention to before.

B005J2UM9S|2.0|I'm a casual fan of ghost hunting shows so this movie seemed like it would hold some promise and it did in the beginning. Be warned there are spoilers ahead, minor ones to begin with and then major ones towards the end.<br /><br />Minor spoilers in this section.<br /><br />The premise is a good one: What would happen to a \\"Ghost Hunting\\" film crew who encounter the paranormal for the first time?<br />The setup is nice with the characters being introduced, I particularly liked how the crew didn't take the ghost hunting seriously, and eventually the host paid the gardener to lie. The psychic was shown to be an actor and fraud right away and it was very apparent they considered this to be strictly entertainment.<br /><br />A detraction here was the weak acting of some of the minor characters, but they are quickly off the screen.<br /><br />If you've seen any ghost hunting show the formula here is correct, as they show them setting up cameras, giving a history of the building, talking about the gear, and then go about wondering in the dark trying to find ghosts while using the occasional piece of electronic equipment.  They hurried through this, but that was fine as it was just a setup.  After hours of fruitless search they take a break and it's apparent that this isn't the first time they are bored with ghost hunting.<br /><br />Eventually the crew sets back out and encounters a series of paranormal events which correctly freaks them out and sends them running back to the lobby and their base location. The girl is particularly hysterical and in a believable decision they decide to pack up and leave. How is this possible? Don't people always have to make stupid decisions to advance the plot in horror movies?<br /><br />Major spoilers ahead.<br /><br />Just when I was getting excited that I was watching a possibly intelligent movie they writers flip the stupid and clichéd switches and the whole thing goes flying off the rails faster than one can say, \\"Let's split up inthis horribly dangerous and frightening place.\\"<br /><br />They immediately send the equipment guy off alone to gather up the cameras when they just ran in fear from the same area. Inexplicably he agrees to go. There goes the movie.<br /><br />From this point on nothing interesting happens which hasn't happened before in a hundred horror movies shot with a shaky cam. There are ghosts who stand around looking bored then scream with big black mouths, the characters separate themselves on purpose at times and then get separated and picked off, and they run around in circles while trying to make the audience nauseous with camera shake. It could have been any group of people with some cameras in an old haunted building for the last two-thirds of the movie.<br /><br />The frustrating thing is that it didn't have to be like this. Why not stick with the original tone of a cocky film crew who slowly has their belief in ghosts confirmed? The small, subtle effects and setups leading to the first encounter were frightening as the characters didn't know what was going on and it was shocking to them and the audience. This theme should have been built upon for the next hour to a climatic ending.<br /><br />The answers unfortunately are likely that the writers got lazy and the studio was too nervous to break out of the shaky-cam-horror formula. It's a shame because the movie showed some promise but turned out to be typical.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This movie was everything it should have been.  Great graphix and good plot.  I will watch again and agian.  Wish I had bought Blu Ray

B008LXZFH6|1.0|Don't waste your money like we did.  Wishing a movie will be funny doesn't make it so.  Crude humor works with middle school students, but I'd like to think some of us are attempting to grow up.  We turned the movie off after 15 minutes and went to Netflix and watched an episode of Frasier.  It was a lazy movie.  Go for a walk, pet your dog, do laundry - anything is better than this!
B005UT29Z0|4.0|Superb cast includes Kevin Spacey & Stanley Tucci. A great film depicting corporate number-crunchers. Putting the human aspect in a not-so friendly environment was an important part of this film.  It explains quite a bit of what really goes on in these big corporations,without dehumanizing the key players.<br />If you are a fan of Wall Street & similar genres,you will enjoy this corporate drama. After watching this film,only 1 question remains.....<br />Morals or Money???

B003Z0BWRM|3.0|Has all the depth of character for a great read but the twist was predictable and disappointing.  If you like supernatural novels its not bad but don't expect too much. Lolly-read I like to call it...sweet but not satisfying.
B00979JTWK|4.0|for me the storyline was far too abrubtly ended, the birth too clinical and detached for such a long awaited and important arrival especially after the protracted romance of arguably theseries two principal characters.The series for me now without Dan Stevens asMathew Crawley will be non-sensical and of no further interest.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I would have paid twice what I did and still would have felt like i was cheating the writer!  I am currently looking up other works by this newcomer!

Seems to benefit the Weather Channel. Not as bad as 1 star, but not as useful or easy as before. &quot;You'll get used to it&quot; is a terrible slogan.

B008JFURF6|4.0|Raja Gosnell (Scooby Doo, Yours, Mine and Ours) directs this sequel and believe it or not, this film is just as good and in some parts better than his the first film which he also directed. Now if you were a fan of the Smurfs before or really enjoyed the first one, this film has everyone back plus a few extra interesting characters and most importantly, a really good story about family!<br /><br />Yes, the arch nemesis Gargamel is back and has never more creatively being played by Hank Azaria (The Simpsons, Godzilla) who is masterfully reprising his role and obviously having  a lot of fun doing it too. You see Gargamel wants to harness the magic power of the Smurfs to increase his wizardry powers to the point in which he can control the entire world. (Insert maniacal laugh here.) However, currently he is a now world-famous magician travelling around and  using what is very little left of his Smurf position. They all end up in Paris, France this time!<br /><br />He ends up creating two new Smurf's that are greyish in color and require the magic Smurf liquid to survive and they are to be considered the `dark' side of what a Smurf can be. Christina Ricci (Sleepy Hallow, Monster) is the voice of Vexy, the spicy and nasty female version of Smurfette. Hackus, the fumbling, not-so-bright `dark' version of a Smurf is voiced by J.B. Smoove (SNL, Date Night).<br /><br />Vexy kidnaps Smurfette who is once again amazingly voiced by Katie Perry (The Ugly Truth, Madagascar 3), under the orders of Gargamel and the adventure ensues! In his last screen performance, Jonathan Winters (The Flintstones, Davis Rules) just before his passing, again reprises his heartfelt role of Papa Smurf. Also back are the always moody Grumpy Smurf voiced by George Lopez (Rio, Valentine's Day), the never intended to do anything wrong - Clumsy Smurf voiced by Anton Yelchin (Star Trek, Fight Night), the proudly Scottish Gusty Smurf voiced by Alan Cummings (X2, Goldeneye) and we are introduced to the extremely narcissistic new blue Smurf, Vanity Smurf voiced by John Oliver (The Daily Show, The Love Guru).<br /><br />Yes, Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother, Doogie Houser) and Jayma Mays (Glee,Mall Cop) are back as the parents of Blu who is now 6 years old and is played by Jacob Tremblay (The Magic Ferret, Motive).  They are all eventually needed to help Papa Smurf find out where Gargamel has captured and imprisoned Smurfette. Neil does a wonderfully believable job as a father with issues with his own father and coping with being a father himself, is just not easy.<br /><br />Now here's where the movie takes a turn for the absolute better. Its real story is about family and what children mean to their fathers. How communication can sometimes be miss-interpreted and as often is the case, sometime parents do things that appear cruel to their children in order to protect them. In the long run, love has no boundaries. How is his introduced?<br /><br />Both Papa Smurf, Neil Patrick Harris and Neil's characters stepfather Victor, played wonderfully by Brendan Gleeson (Gangs of New York, Troy), all learn a valuable lesson of family and parenting. Again, it's extremely heartfelt and coupled with Smurfette learning about her new `sister' in Vexy, the film is a wonderful uplifting family treat. Forget Pacific Rim, see something you'll actually remember and feel good about! Smurf-tacular!mely narcissistic new blue Smurf, Vanity Smurf voiced by John Oliver (The Daily Show, The Love Guru).<br /><br />Yes, Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother, Doogie Houser) and Jayma Mays (Glee,Mall Cop) are back as the parents of Blu who is now 6 years old and is played by Jacob Tremblay (The Magic Ferret, Motive).

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This is an intense Science Fiction film that shows a hypothetical future in which those in power play games with the lives of so many who are not.  I was both a bit depressed by the possibility that this might portend an actual future and uplifted by an improbable love affair.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|It's definitely a valuable guide, and the price couldn't be better, obviously, but it doesn't quite go far enough, in my opinion.  If it could be revised to cover formatting with Open Office or Libre Office, that would be perfect and would rate five stars.  Some of us eschew Microsoft ;)

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I was seeking a solid set of headphones to replace my old pair that had fallen apart (Bose noise canceling-- would not recommend) for general purpose use. These headphones are exceptionally well built and it seems they will last forever. The ear cushions are replaceable with other materials, but the default pads are comfortable enough. They block out a good deal of external noise as well. The cord is a perfect length for using on a computer but would likely become cumbersome if used on a mobile device.

159514188X|5.0|WARNING may contain spoilers ! :This book is a best seller , so I already had high expectations going in . I must say that my expectations were met. The book was absolutely riveting . First off I loved the unique format, of Hannah using cassette tapes to tell her story . It was really clever to use an outdated form of communication in a modern setting . This book is like nothing I have ever read before and for that I applaud Jay Asher. Prior to writing this review , I read some of the criticisms of the story . I too struggled with Hannah 's reasons at times during the story , and thought that's all ? Is that really a reason to want to die ? I read and reread sections trying to put myself in Hannah's place , and come to conclusion. To Hannah her issues seemed like the end of the world , and not getting help was her biggest mistake . It's not that her having one bad day lead her to end her life . It was one event after another piling on top of her causing her to breakdown . It was a snowball effect , as described in the story . I don't think Hannah should be scrutinized for not being emotionally strong , or able to work past her issues . Asking for help is easier said than done . Was her life the most horrible and awful thing in the world ? No . But then again no one knows what it is like to be her , and you shouldn't judge or criticize her for how she felt . As someone who has been suicidal , I understand that it takes a lot less for people than being beaten every night to want their life to end . Jay Asher's novel is real . Reading this story I thought of the guy who ended his life after his roommate filmed him having a sexual encounter with another man in his college dorm room . All it took was one event to end his life , most likely from feelings of embarrassment , shame , and guilt . Hannah had her privacy invaded so many times throughout the story which I'm sure lead to similar feelings . Hannah was strong for awhile, but eventually got to a point where she couldn't shake her reputation , so she decided to give into it , which made her feel even more lost than before . She got to the point where she felt stuck . I don't think she wanted to die so much as to have the pain end . As a young girl I don't think she realized how permanent her decision was . This was one of the most complex , twisted , well -written , thought -provoking , and hauntingly beautiful novels I have ever come across . It is like nothing I've ever read before , and nothing I will come across in the future .

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|You've probably noticed that when I review a YA title, I usually feel the need to mention how hard I tend to be on YA. Not because there isn't plenty of wonderful YA fiction, it's just that sometimes it's way too hard for me, at my age, to identify with young protagonists who are at wildly different points in their lives. So, that said, when I do review a YA title, I consider it exceptional indeed, and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is about as exceptional as they get. Since it was published in 2011, it's gotten so many glowing reviews I started wondering if it really did live up to the hype, and after getting a paperback copy, finally decided to dive in. Peregrine is told in the voice of Jacob, relating the story of his muddle through his 16th year, as the child of a mother who is heir to a chain of drugstores and a father that can't seem to complete anything of substance, moving from project to project, only to abandon it. Jacob has a rather aimless, poor-little-rich-kid vibe, and he's aware of this, but when his beloved grandfather, Abe, whose health has been declining with alarming frequency, is attacked and killed outside his home, Jacob is aimless no more. In fact, it's Jacob that finds his grandfather's ravaged body, and imagines he sees a terrible face in the undergrowth, but it's only his imagination, right?<br /><br />Jacob feels there might be more to his grandfather's story (especially after finding a very, very interesting letter), and on the advice of his therapist, he decides to visit a tiny island off the coast of Wales which supposedly houses the children's home that Abe grew up in, and that Abe left to go fight in WWII. Jacob has seen photos of many of the children that supposedly lived at the home, and many of these photos contain oddities that Abe insists are the talents and abilities of some very different, and very special children. Jacob is understandably dubious as to the photos' authenticity, but after arriving in Wales, accompanied by his father, he sets off to find the home, and among the wreckage, some very peculiar things begin to happen.<br /><br />It's immediately obvious from the moment you pick up this gorgeous book, that you're going to have a unique experience. It's a beautifully put together book, and interspersed among the narrative are the very pictures that are described within. There are sepia photos of each of the peculiar children that make up Miss Peregrine's motley assortment, and I found myself flipping back to look at the pictures again and trying to keep myself from paging forward and spoiling the fun. What Jacob finds among the ruins of that long ago children's home is a portal to another time and place, so magical and beautiful it defies description. However, where there is light, there is also darkness, and although Jacob is content to wile away the hours with his new friends, discovering their abilities and delighting in their company (especially that of the lovely, feisty Emma), something dark is indeed coming, and it could threaten this beautiful world that Jacob has found. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is by turns heartbreakingly delicate and unflinching, fraught with wonder and danger, and sparkles with delightful and terrifying magic. I highly recommend this book to kids and adults alike, and have never experienced anything quite like it! Keep an eye out for the sequel, Hollow City, in January 2014.nied by his father, he sets off to find the home, and among the wreckage, some very peculiar things begin to happen.<br /><br />It's immediately obvious from the moment you pick up this gorgeous book, that you're going to have a unique experience.

0374203032|3.0|Michael J. Sandel's \\"What Money Can Buy\\" is thoughtful and intelligent book that avoids rotting into the scurvy juices of academic jargon. There is something to be said when a public intellectual, like Sandel, who so willingly eliminates complexity of diction and details to serve a higher purpose. His writing voice is fairly Milli Vanilli--with no dashes of sarcasm or irony to be found, and the diction and sentence play suggest an earnest decision to reach the widest possible (and public) audience at the expense of creativity. It is a smooth operator, and finishes its end-run within 200 pages.<br /><br />By paragraph three, all of the hallmarks and halos of liberal/progressive pronouncements are made concisely and without apology. This is a fine perspective that is worth listening to, even though liberalism comes with its own set of blinders and contradictions. This worldview is all-the-more deserving as progressives like Christina Romer and Paul Krugman have been shunted aside by the Alan Greenspans of the World; and worse yet, Marxists have been flushed out of econ departments at an alarming rate. Hence, a liberal perspective on the role of markets in daily life written to a popular audience is a notable and lasting feature of the work. The book is arranged neatly under subject titles that explore the degree of how market fundamentalism functions adversely to other values that transcend ideas of money, community and love. (Sandel avoids the word \\"neoliberalism\\" because his colleague Larry Summers is probably NSA-ing the motherf&@#@r.) By tackling topics as various as \\"Naming Rights,\\" \\"Jumping the Queue,\\" \\"Markets in Life and Death,\\" and \\"Incentives,\\" Sandel tackles the increasingly authoritarian aspects of state capitalism, as its desires for profit crowd out other values and aspects of the public good. For anyone left-of-the-dial or generally well-read and activist in nature, some of his assertions feel fairly pre-packaged. They don't have the big ideas and cosmic questions that David Graeber asks in \\"Debt,\\" or that David Harvey entertains in the \\"Enigma of Capital.\\" That being said, \\"What Money Can't Buy\\" is a great work for a college course or for people less aware of the ecology of capitalism in their daily lives. For more self-aware readers, what Sandel does well is to find the absurd extensions of creeping capitalism as it eats up areas of life that were formerly in the public domain. He acknowledges aspects of daily life now commercialized (baseball parks, people getting tattoos on their foreheads) that are widely known, but then he provides some stunning details about market relations in foreign countries that are quite stunning; for instance, in Finland, speeding tickets are set at the percentage of one's income rather than the flat-rate that destroys the poor and encourages lawlessness among the wealthy (a Finnish, wealthy scion spent $217,000 on a speeding ticket). Sandel starts with what is commonly known about the privatization of the commons, but then he manages, through effort and research work to find some hilariously tragic concepts (a local city's police cars were paid for from commercial advertising--thank you Carl's Jr!).<br /><br />\\"What Money Can't Buy\\" seems to suggest that these encroachments of markets into features of everyday life degrade and devalue society and human worth, but the author fails to think in bigger transcendental arcs of imagineering. Sandel poses no solutions about how Americans (or the world at large) can reclaim or re-occupy the commons. Still, the book functions well in its ability to create awareness of the problems posed by state capitalism. - {Bookgasm Rate: 77/100} -

B0001CCY7E|5.0|What a wonderful movie and music score! I love listening to this while either working or driving as it is very soothing....
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This is too simple to use.  I play it when I need a break from the more serious games.  It's just okay.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This an exceptional series and am so glad we listened to the hype and began watching it! Can't wait for season 4!
1575666286|5.0|It is great.  Very good information on nutrition.  Any novice could put some of this in practice, or all of it.  Even a small change is better by far, than no change.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|standard file browser with intuitive interface that greatly facilitates moving files around without a computer.  Can't ask for more if you're looking for at least those features.
B00003CXPD|1.0|I did not receive the billy elliot movie. Instead I received a talking heads concert dvd. So in turn the wrong item was shipped to me
B009POCG0Y|5.0|this was a really good film from the start to the finish. the acting was first rate and the production<br />award winning.  I recommend it.........
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love building houses and killing zombies. I also love joining other people's worlds.  I am eight years old and this is my favorite game!

B00DUIBZSK|5.0|Wow Selena has hit a jackpot! I have been listening to her album non-stop since the day i bought it. Every track has some great beat to dance along to. I like how she has been changing up her sound a bit and it's becoming dance/club music. It still is the same Selena but much grown up. I deff recomend all songs on this album!
B009G41CG2|4.0|it is a good game, play it to keep my mind sharp, play it when I need to relax or just loafing around
B008G3N71W|5.0|This is a seriously erotic book by a writer at the height of her literary powers and will remind readers of those great luminaries of the genre Anais Nin and the Marquis de Sade. It is clear by the other reviews on this page that the novel is controversial and touches people deeply - 5-star plaudits mixed with 1-star condemnations by readers who were expecting the  erotica-lite pioneered by EL James and received erotica in its classic literary form.<br /><br />The story: failed actress Greta May meets a stranger on the train and accepts his phone number. She calls, they meet and he ravages her on the carpet. The shock becomes pleasure and the girl in the coming months submits herself to a sensual program of punishment and discipline - the regime reshaping her mind and body, instilling a powerful self-confidence and charisma - and, ultimately, putting her where she wants to be: center stage in the spotlight.<br /><br />Chloe Thurlow is an extremely good writer. A Girl's Adventure is totally compelling and I do not hesitate to give the book the 5 stars it deserves.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|the full version is in small print and the mobile is missing a lot of what I want to see.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|This author is one of my favorite and I think I have read almost all of his books or close to it.  The stories keep you interested from page one to the end.  Good read and another of Mr. Connelly's books that is hard to put down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a wonderful game I can play for hours and I love how they come up with some new upgrade every time and something different to surprise you . I am basically speechless because of this game and can not wait till the next upgrade.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|All I wanted was a quick radar app, but I ended up with a complete weather report that takes too long to view.
B005F9TQ0Q|5.0|My dad loves Bob Dylan. He is my dad's idol and my dad absolutely loves this Cd. He sings along to it all day and all night.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|It was a lovely &#34;true&#34; story!  I am an animal lover so it was really a touching story....even my husband had tears in his eyes.  Humans need to take a lesson of an animal's love and devotion! :)
B0053O89IS|4.0|THE DVD WAS FINE BUT THE CASE WAS CRACKED.  THIS DID NOT IMPAIR WATCHING.WAITING NOT FOR SEASON EIGHT TO COME OUT
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Thor was an enjoyable movie...nothing spectacular but a good way to spend a coupla hours while stuck on the couch with a sprained ankle
B000N4SHOE|5.0|The 'Lake District' in England is a particularly beautiful area, and this true story<br />of Beatrix Potter who lived and painted in this area and spent many thousands of<br />dollars (British pounds) to preserve and keep it,  is wonderfully portrayed<br />by Renee Zellweger..<br />I would heartily recommend this movie.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I found it to be a lot of fun. I like the fast pace of it. I also like the fact that although it has characters that are juvenile in nature, which is to say geared toward kids, I enjoy it as an adult.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|Much as I loved the music soaring through this whole movie, I found upon reflection, that it was<br />a rather dull story, and the plot rather trite, but ah the music was wonderful..<br />J. Mace<br />Montreal, Que.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I do a lot of shopping on ebay so again very glad that I was able to get it here. Thank you for all of your apps
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is soooooooo great like u don't understand<br />I can play this ant time any where u should get it
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|To the point, current, and insightful. Great links throughout the book.  Easy enough for almost everyone who can sit down for 2 hours to read in one sitting.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This DVD was just as great as I expected!!  I received it in a quickly manor. I will be ordering season 2 & 3 as soon as I finish viewing these DVDs.
B00843TZJM|5.0|We purchased this video after attending a concert - it was a great experience and the video is a great reminder, thanks CSN.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I liked this app just fine until its latest update a week ago. It was tricky to navigate and the map function sucked. Now it won't even open on my Kindle Fire; last time I tried to open it, I had to restart my KF all together. Have uninstalled app and will be looking for an alt app to check the weather with.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This was a great and entertaining movie.  Watched this with my 14 year old son and he enjoyed it as well.  I would recommend this to anyone who would like to experience a little adventure.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Very important to see so to understand more deeply the oblation of Our Lord on good friday and it's beginning at the last supper. This film is a terrific meditation primer for the sorrowful mysteries of the rosary, the stations of the cross, and the sorrows of our lady. It is something amazing which has been given to the church and to all souls as a gift, to know Jesus better and that He loves us most piercingly.<br />When this film came to the prisons there were many conversions. This shows us that God's work can be in the media and that we should pray for more of that work to be done.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It's not ground-breaking cinema, but if you like fun, light-hearted romantic comedies, you'll enjoy this one. There aren't any eye-rolling, overly-sappy moments, and the &#34;dad patrol&#34; is funny.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|The purity of courtship glowed in this film. I know Queen Victoria was a battle ax in real life, but this was a cute romantic movie.
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite romantic comedies.You have to suspend belief a little, but it is a very rewarding romantic comedy. The only thing that bugs me slightly is there doesn't seem to be any real redeeming quality to Julia's character other than she's a famous movie star. That's an easy one to overlook, though. I've seen this over 20 times and still absolutely enjoy it.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Great read to understand Harry Hole.  Still one book missing though to complete the complex word of this character.  Any Harry Hole fan needs to read this one, if for no other reason, to learn how to pronounce his name.
B005LAII4E|1.0|Yeah, Barf<br />I hope Paramount & Hasbro go bankrupt peddling this kinda horse doo doo.<br />All this money spent on great special effects and written & directed by a team of morons
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game, its just what I've been looking for. Something to challenge me and keep my interest...perfect. :)
B00CS74W0C|1.0|Why is the price higher to get The Crossfire Series Books 1-3 by Sylvia Day [Kindle Edition  It is cheaper to buy each book. Don't understand
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have read other Baldacci books but this is my new favorite. Right from the start the reader is drawn into the world of spies, hitmen, international relations and government secrets.  This book is very fast paced and really keeps the reader guessing about what's next. Will Robie is a complex character but still relatable (if you can relate to secret government assassins).  Stayed up way too late because I had to know how it ended. Highly recommend this to any fan of this genre.
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|I agree with beautiful graphics. Interesting idea. Some of the minigames require lots of physical dexterity and quick reflexes which I no longer have. The biggest problem is the guide only shows places on the map that you've already encountered. I need to pick up a rock in location E21 but I can't find that location. I even started all over again and no E21 therefore no rock.  I'm dead in the water. I'm going to try to find the online walk through that another reviewer mentioned but this is a pain. The instructions in French don't help either. Too bad. Still, it's a very good price for this substantial game. It would get 5 stars if not for these issues.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was a fun book to read and I recommend it for fun. The ending is pretty much determined by a feel-good presence throughout the book, but a good read nevertheless.
B001OSIV62|5.0|This film is beautiful in so many ways.  It's hard to believe that this story actually occurred.  Watch it when you can.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This book spoke to me...and I bet it speaks to most people. I highly recommend this to anyone, regardless if you are in need or not.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Wasn't a big fan of the movie at first but over time I started picking up on the funny sayings and incidents in the movie.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|It was a good book. I could put it down for while and get back to it later, so it was not a real grabber. Some of the characters were a bit over-the-top, but then again, I already knew that. It would have been nice to read about average people like me defeat the evil out there, but then it might not have been so interesting?
B000FCKC4C|4.0|A seemingly simple boy goes on a quest to find his grail and in the end it is clear that he carried his grail inside himself. This is a lovely narrative which you can read several times, and discover something new again and again. The writer has an inside view of alchemism and gives an insight into the internal processes of the alchemist, who might discover a way to transmute a metal, but is mainly busy to transform him- or her Self.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story, acting, plot twists.  It's hard to imagine a season without Dan Stevens but I'm sure by the second episode of the fourth season, there'll be someone new in Mary's life and we'll all be intrigued.<br /><br />The third season had some great highs and equally reversed lows.  But that's great storytelling- when we keep coming back for more.  You will thoroughly enjoy it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is great it is just like subway suffers but with a nicer twist to it and it keeps my kids entertained
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was impressed by this author and the details he wrote that gave a vivid picture in your imagination of what was going on throughout this story.  My daughter urged me to read it, so I started it and then did not want to put it down.
B000OE4NWS|5.0|My 9 year old son wanted this for his birthday and got it.  he loves using it with his Bruder tractor to plant imaginary crops in our living room on the carpet.  does everything it states in the ad and showed in the video.  very realistic & sturdy!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I haven't played all of the games on this CD, but hopefully I will. The Flow game is slow but intereesting, while Journey is a discovering title, and Flower has brilliant graphics. All 3 for 1 price is a cool deal.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Nothing like some good ole corruption to really get you riled up! this movie was an awesome treat. Love Wahlberg and Crowe. They did an excellent job delivering this tale.
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|Do you like action films? Do you like 3D movies? If you said yes to both these questions then you should see this movie and if possible in 3D. It is a great 3D movie with extraordinary filming and slow motion action.  The coreagraphed fight scenes are extremely well done. The plot is exciting and well acted. There is some comic releafe and many tongue in cheek moments. I highly recommend this movie for you action buffs.
B007ZJDGXC|4.0|Love a good Action movie. This movie contained action and a nice level of suspense as well. Nice plot twists. Not to mention the cast had great chemistry.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I found this app useful for viewing YouTube on my Kindle. I really don't use this app very much but when I have it has proven to be a successful app and I am able to watch YouTube on my Kindle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun going through  the puzzles.  great fun,  but more floors please. It challenges  the mind and beats sitting aat the gate waiting to board.  Thanks,  but more floors please.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I give it 5 stars totally recommend this movie I have not got that freaked out in a very long time.<br />Definitely worth the money;)
B008XKSW7M|1.0|Hey Hollywood, next time you want to make a rom-com out of a non-fiction reference guide, perhaps try volume 'M' of the Encyclopedia. Then at least I could see Cameron Diaz get MURDERED, MAIMED, MANGLED, or maybe buried in MANURE. I can sit through a bad movie. This was worse. My wife actually apologized for picking this movie to watch. Listen, Elizabeth Banks is HOTTT. But I was hoping her character would die in childbirth, I hated her so much. The scenes with Chris Rock were unbearable. I like Chris Rock. But watching Chris Rock try not to swear every other word is as painful as popping a baby out your lady parts. At least that's how it seemed to me.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Its a comeplete copy of Mario I like it is fun and enjoyable for kids you should get this game :-)
B00BCX2F66|2.0|I saw this case in one of the HTC Flagship stores here in Asia. At first glance, I really liked the quality and feel of the case, specifically the camera hole. I liked how it fit the camera nicely. However, what has been disappointing is the quality and protection of the product.<br /><br />First off, after about a month of use, the edges of the cases started to come apart. The product is made from a leather material (not sure if it's real) and the edges are treated with this rubber. However, the rubber portion has started to peel and i'm sure if i use it more, the whole edge will peel off.<br /><br />Also, the front protection isn't that well thought out. I actually almost never drop my phone, but this case hardly protect against drops. Mainly because the front flap opens when you drop it. There's no magnet or anything that will keep the front cover closed, so when the phone goes down, it usually opens up, exposing the screen.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Case looks nice<br />- Functionality to let it stand is good.<br />- Great fit/form for the HTC One (M7)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Doesn't protect well from drops<br />- Not too durable
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft it is awesome I love the nether and herobrine. I can't get enough of this game you should get this game!
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|Me and my husband love it he wont let me play anymore all he wants to do is play hockey
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a wonderful thinking game. This game makes you think like a detective  and forces you to notice every little detail in the vast rooms. Every level provides the player with a new and exciting challenge. The next level being s lightly harder than the last. It is definitely a five star escape game. The design of the rooms is also very nice. They look like very nice modern rooms and they provide a lot of nice hiding places for the many many clues that you need to ESCAPE THE ROOM!!! Every person in the entire world absolutely should try this game. Thank you for allowing me to write this review. I am definitely over the age of 13.  I hope this review has been very helpful. It won't let me submit my review.......I'd like to submit my review please so I can get back to playing the game. Please, I really just want to play the game.
B000000XB9|5.0|Works great and is just what I wanted and got it on time also sounds great. Very happy with it
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|There was one in the Kindle box - so it was a double up<br />you should state what comes with the kindle
1781162646|5.0|Joyland is a little different from previous Stephen King novels, in that there is no real supernatural element.  It is partly about solving a murder; but it is more about that time when we were young, between high school and &#34;real life.&#34;  The time when we were starting to learn about life and love and loss.  Like all of King's works, it is fast-moving and features a cast of memorable characters, including a little boy whose day at the amusement park is one of the most beautiful things I've ever read.
1451638450|5.0|Finally a story about Miles' cousin, that idiot Ivan.  Loved it and I am so glad to have another book to add to my Vorkosigan series. If you have never read this series and if you love intelligent and entertaining science fiction, read this series. Amusing, (sometimes hilarious!) thought provoking and non-stop action. One of my favorite authors.
B004J4WNL2|2.0|After watching the authors Ted talk I was curious to read the book. I was disappointed. Too many antecdotes and generalization about being an introvert vs extrovert.
1468179993|2.0|This book was written by someone that has just watched a lot of TED talks. It is short which is a bonus but don't think that this book is a first hand guide to delivering a TED talk.
B00BR0SEAK|3.0|I am a big Deep Purple fan but this is very different. I may have to listen a few times. I could change my mind and learn to love it. I was crazy about the Rapture of the Deep.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I love this season sooooo much. I could watch this show and every season over and over again. I'm not sure why I'm so addicted but I am..\\" You're welcome!!\\"  Lol
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This is a great movie for the family to watch to get ready for the Christmas Holiday Season, really liked it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Great little adult fairy tale.  I absolutely loved it.  It brought back lots of memories from childhood, both good and bad.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|Not all I expected, but good just the same. A good plot, back ground thought to the classic Wizard Of Oz
B00E0OK2X2|3.0|bought game because double fine and Tim Schneider do good work.  gameplay is repetitive but visuals are striking and the soundtrack is pulsing.  will continue to play just to hear the different mixes, but price should be at the. 99 cent level for what the game delivers.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The game is fun and keeps my interest which says a lot. It is a great way to keep your mind active and focused. I play anytime I am bored. This is a nice way to spend your time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I started reading this book because everyone raved about it, but it took me a while to get into the book. I'm not sure I liked the way it ended and did not like the route it took. Skeptic party of 1 I know, but I admit about half way through I had to find out what the heck happens.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I play slot of these types of games and this is one of the best!  Really makes you think and a great way to pass some time!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love thiS book it made me cry and happy all my emotions it is a emotion twister I live it and I don't like reading but I loved reading this book
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A friend told me about this game app for my kindly fire. We both enjoy word searches. So I tried it. It is very additive.  Lost track of time while playing this game.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Great fun for the entire family to watch together! I'd recommend for ages 5 and up because younger kids may not stay as well entertained.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not a bad little brain teaser. Reminds me of point and click games I loved as a kid. Makes me want to play must now.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|planed on going into the theater and going to sleep, well it was an eye opener another one i bought and watch over and over
B003YFIUW8|5.0|A topic that interest me. My church reading group recommended it. A demonsration n of faith in dire circumstances. A wonderful view of a childs mind.
B006VZS1EA|5.0|but to my supprise i loved it. it's one of those movie's i'd buy and watch over and over again
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Best show on TV, only issue I really have is, when in the world is season 3 going to be up??
0345537998|5.0|nothing like his ice and fire series but lots of fun, a great read that is now making its rounds to all his fans.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I began playing this game last week and was instantly addicted.  Just recently though, it appears there was an update made to the game.  Now when I start the game, I can only get through the movie part then the game stalls out on the loading screen. I love playing this game and hope that this can be fixed.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It would be nice if you added a chat bar so we can talk to the other users playing.<br />Ty
1435114949|5.0|I love everything about this book. The gold edged pages, the ribbon bookmark....when I first got this book I just held it and looked at it for a while. It's absolutely gorgeous, and puts my other books to shame. I also like the text and general format of the book. Great for any Sherlock Holmes fan.
B00701L5XS|1.0|I found that I did not want to agree to the information that was being requested in order to use this product. I deleted it without agreeing to the TOS.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|This second time around is slow moving. I am not sure if I care enough to continue in the series. Maybe later.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I love it when there is a great mystery. Watch out for the sticky puzzle of webs. That is a touchy mess, took me awhile. Good luck.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a must get but the only way you can play on servers is to get block launcher PRO you must get the one with PRO but still without that a great game!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It is different from the movie in that it is written like a journalistic account from multiple sources.  However, the perspectives from different people from different areas of the world made it a fascinating story.
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|An awesome read full of magic, myths and monsters.<br />I loved every second of it, it is most certainly going to be a series that I read over and over again. I recommend this to any parents trying to get their children to read more.<br />HAT'S OFF TO RICK RIORDAN!!!
B000L53D4O|5.0|Great toy for little ones just beginning to cruise / walk!  And my daughter loves the toys on the front of the walker too.
3832797033|2.0|I'm a Porsche enthusiast and own a 911 Turbo. I bought this book expecting to read &#34;the&#34; illustrated history of this amazing car. However, for my surprise, it is basically a bunch of nice photographs bundled together in chronological order. There is almost no text or information. Well, if you like photography, as I do, then this may be a book for you. But if you want to learn about the Porsche 911 and its history, then look for something else. Too expensive for what it is. Well, I returned the book to Amazon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Couldn't wait to go through season 3, ended up watcing it all in one sitting.  Looking foward to season 4.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Read all of the Nesbo, Inspector Harry Hole novels and never knew how his name was pronounced.  Harry Holy reads much better than Harry Hole.  Looking foward to reading the new novel: The  Policeman in October
140006922X|5.0|I'm a Catholic, not an atheist.  I have no agenda, I simply find the life of Christ fascinating and read as much about it as I can.  Other reviewers are right that this isn't a work of original research, but the research it's built on is serious and valid.  What's different about this book is the author's synthesis and interpretation of the research, and I found his conclusions truly intriguing.  Unfortunately many people seem to think that their faith is so fragile that dissent can shatter it.  I have a little more faith in my faith than that.  Having finished the book, I feel as though I've experienced a nice discussion about Jesus, not a brainwashing maneuver.  This book does a masterful job of explaining all of the elements present in the setting of the Holy Land at the time of Christ in terms that are accessible to any layperson.  The players and the timeline are presented brilliantly.  Aslan forwards a great case--which you don't have to accept as your own, nor have an aneurysm over--about who he thinks Jesus really was.  One or two of his points I find a little bit tenuous, but overall he has a very cohesive opinion.<br /><br />If you read this book with an open mind, I think you'll like it as much as I did.  You won't be re-programmed by reading it.
B000002VCW|5.0|I bought this on a bit of a CD buying spree--I was never an al Stewart fan, but this was very cheap, and I had a bit of nostalgia to hear &#34;Year of the Cat&#34; again.  The music is very good!  OK, Stewart's over-enunciating singing style can wear, but the music is worth it.
B001FA0W5W|2.0|Though the book is full of interesting ideas, in one important example it seems to have missed its mark. Below is an excerpt from the book and an analysis of the mistake:<br /><br />Excerpt from \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb; chapter 11 \\"Randomness And Our Mind: We Are Probability Blind\\".<br />Examples of Biases in Understanding Probability:<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />I found in behavioral literature at least forty damning examples of such acute biases, systematic departures from rational behavior widespread across professions and fields. Below is the account of a well-known test, and an embarrassing one for the medical profession. The following famous quiz was given to the medical doctors (which I borrowed from the excellent Deborah Bennet's Randomness).<br /><br />A test of a disease presents a rate of 5% false positives. The disease strikes 1/1,000 of the population. People are tested at random, regardless of whether they are suspected of having the disease. A patient's test is positive. What is the probability of the patient being stricken with the disease?<br /><br />Most doctors answered 95%, simply taking into account the fact that the test has a 95% accuracy rate. The answer is the conditional probability that the patient is sick and the test shows it- close to 2%. Less than one in five professionals got it right.<br /><br />I will simplify the answer (using the frequency approach). Assume no false negatives. Consider that out of 1,000 patients who are administered the test, one will be expected to be afflicted with the disease. Out of a population of the remaining 999 healthy patients, the test will identify about 50 with the disease (it is 95% accurate). The correct answer should be that the probability of being afflicted with the disease for someone selected at random who presented a positive test is the following ratio:<br /><br />Number of afflicted persons / Number of true and false positives<br />here 1 in 51.<br /><br />Think of the number of times you will be given a medication that carries damaging side effects for a given disease you were told you had, when you may only have a 2% probability of being afflicted with it!<br /><br />Unquote<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Analysis<br /><br />Depending on the interpretation of the words in the quiz and on the assumptions that are made, the probability could range from 2% to 95% to being indeterminate.<br /><br />Ambiguity in the Quiz: The words \\"rate of 5% false positives\\" can be understood to mean either:<br /><br />* The likely number of false positives out of all positives (both true & false), or<br />* The number of patients, out of all the patients who are tested, whose result is likely to be falsely positive.<br /><br />2% Probability: The given \\"answer\\" assumes that the words \\"rate of 5% false positives\\" means that out of the total number of patients who are administered the test, 5% will be falsely identified as positive.<br /><br />This assumption leads to the conclusion that \\"out of the population of the remaining 999 healthy patients, the test will identify about 50 with the disease (it is 95% accurate)\\".<br /><br />Inaccurate results can be due to false positives or false negatives. The test could identify all the patients as negative and yet have one or more afflicted patients if such a result was found to be false.<br /><br />95% Probability: It can also be assumed that the words \\"rate of 5% false positives\\" means the number of false positives out of all positives (both true & false)\\".<br /><br />If there are 100 positives, 5 of them will be false and the remaining 95 will be true. If a patient's test is positive, there will be a 5% probability of it being false and 95% probability of it being true.<br /><br />Indeterminate Probability: A true positive or a false negative could both result in the patient being afflicted.Since the quiz provides no idea about the rate of false negatives, the probability of the patient being afflicted cannot be computed. The patient's test could be negative but subsequently found to be a false result.<br /><br />An Unambiguous Quiz: An unambiguous description would have been:<br /><br />* Out of all the patients who test positive, 5% will be falsely identified as positive<br />* Out of all the patients who are tested, 5% will be falsely identified as positive.<br /><br />The quiz could also have clarified the rate of false negatives and clarified that there cannot be a test without a positive or negative result.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I found this book difficult to read.  There were times when it became very interesting and then it would drop into 'dull' reading.  However, there was something there that made me want to come back to it to discover a very surprising ending.<br /><br />I don't think I'll spend time looking for this author's books on the shelves or on my kindle.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|for some reason it won't open up at all on my kindle. I open the app and I watch the little video and then I get the loading screen and that's it. nothing else. please don't waste your time with this.

B005K17RU0|1.0|Had both this app and Weather Channel app on my Kindle Fire (not HD). Updates have caused some sort of interference between the two, so now both of them don't work. I successfully uninstalled Weather Channel, but when I try to uninstall this app, the Kindle tells me it cannot locate this app. You have some shared programming between the two that isn't working.
B009369Z8A|5.0|This movie is GREAT FOR THE MAN's MAN and the girls love it too.  It's got a great love story... that's not too gushy for the guys.  Lots of action and the fact that it's based on a true story based in Virginia, makes it even better.  It's a way to remember how hard times were back then and what people had to do to survive.  A movie that you can watch over and over!
B007EECSFA|3.0|Found it a repeat of her other books.  Can figure out where she is going pgs before ahe gets to it.  Very &#34;wordy&#34;.
B00BB8Q1RQ|4.0|Just thought I would add that to the ignorant reviews I kept reading. I thought this film was fantastic. It is indeed a fact it did not hold true to the novel, however, to scream pro-abortion here is wrong.
B00CEMH31Q|3.0|I am literally Hanson's #1 fan. I flew from New Zealand to Australia to see them live for their Shout It Out concert last year. A 15 year wait, and it was so worth it! I love all their albums, but I have to say, this is my least favourite. Boo, I know... I'm sorry... I love the catchy tune of 'Juliet' and a few other songs, but... Yeah, nah (as we say in NZ). Not the best.<br />It's nice to hear something different from the guys, but I sure hope their next album goes back to their original sound!!
0375842209|5.0|I am about 2/3 of the way through this book and I like it a lot.<br />Often I have to stop reading until the tears clear from my eyes.<br />The writing style is different from anything I have read before, he uses the gentle (not the grim) reaper as the narrator for the story..
B00AEFZ8OY|5.0|Team America is one of the greatest works of American satire ever perpetrated. I actually prefer the theatrical release but considering this edition is cheaper than the unlimited streaming option, it's a bargain.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I got this game the minute I got my kindle and my kids loved playing it. But then the other day it updated and never worked again. Thank God it was  free
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is so realistic and so much fun I love playing it and so does my little girl shes always wanted a pony and now she can have one without all of the mess
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Been playing for a few months now. You can do fine without buying stuff, but it does take some time. Definitely recommend. the game to those who have some time now and then to play
B00AVFO41K|3.0|Not as wonderful as I hoped. Very frustrating and not quick to respond.found it a bit of a pain .
B00004Z459|4.0|Sometimes you need to take something in perspective to see how truly great it is.  Now with Linkin Park a completely different sounding band, many people have forgotten their original roots in rap and rock.  Now the album sounds like a lot of others.  But that's where perspective comes in.<br /><br />What was on top of the charts in the year 2000?  BBMak.  Backstreet Boys.  N Sync.  Toni Braxton.  Jennifer Lopez.  Linkin Park's debut was a breath of fresh air.  And it still is honestly.  Yes a lot of the songs do sound the same.  But listen to tracks like One Step Closer and In The End.  Tell me that doesn't get you up and moving.<br /><br />Great stuff.  Then and now.  A good addition to your collection.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great very helpful. Like it,a lot , it's good to have things all in one place. Would definitely recommend this.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Enjoyed watching Iron Man, Capt America, The Hulk and Thor work together in one movie.  Was a really fantastic cinematic experience!
B008HJGPVO|1.0|This stylus already split on the end and I have only had it a few weeks.  None of the tips really work very well after the first few weeks.  It does not stand up game/app to use and I do not have a heavy hand.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|Already have a nice PDF reader - that we paid a couple of bucks for (on sale).  Still, never hurts to look at alternatives,  especially given $0 cost.<br /><br />Thought the license agreement was unusually complex compared to other android apps used to date, but it did not seem especially worrisome.<br /><br />A quick look at the app did not reveal any obvious usage flaws, nor did it balk at opening several pdf docs even though no internet or data connection was available.<br /><br />More comparison is needed to be certain, but impression is that Repligo is a decent choice, but not an outstanding one.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The quality of HBO's production of George R. R. Martin's fantasy epic continues to thrill, amaze and entertain. Obviously, some liberties are taken with Martin's work (under his watchful eye, of course), but nothing so gross that fans of the novels would walk away from the series. As a devoted fan of both the books and the series, I am supremely satisfied that a company such as HBO has brought one of my fondest literary fantasies to life. Enjoy!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Interesting hidden object quest game that works well on the kindle. It is a fairly varied game and a good time waster.
B005544V6A|5.0|This show is spectacular.  I cannot stop watching it.  It is hard to believe this show is on USA network.  The tone feels like an FX or Showtime program.
1416595554|2.0|I thought the outline story of the novel was very good but the writing of it did not do the book justice. The characters were poorly outlined and no empathy was felt by me towards any of them. The scenes between Sashenka and Benya Golden are emotionally devoid of all feeling and abysmally written.  They do not give any feeling of the tension and passion needed to make the reader believe that either of the characters are in love to the extent that they would take the risk of being exposed and their lives shattered. I felt that the book was distasteful and that it could have been so much better.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun!!  Love me some minion entertainment!  Great fun for the entire family!  A lot more fun than running away from rabid monkeys!  :)
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I really like the meaning behind this story. It is something that most people now days can relate to...being and feeling dead. I believe everyone needs to see this movie at least once.
B007PVHANM|5.0|This film really gives you a chance to see the man behind the legend. I was a Bob Marley fan before, but this film allowed me to gain a whole new respect for him as an artist, and as a person.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|just don't need it will delete it i guess i am too green for some of this stuff or just plain dumb

B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I liked the way the story was told through two different eyes of two different generations connected through a common theme.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Was exactly as described and pictured.  My kids loved the cards.  Works well with kids and accidental dirty hands spills etc, cards can be easily clean too...My kids love playing Uno during family time.  These cards were perfect.  Love it!!
B0081336FO|5.0|Production quality is amazing.  Writing is excellent.  Acting team of Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock) and Martin Freeman (Dr. Watson) have great chemistry together.  Can't wait until Season 3

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|It's great, I'm able to transfer files to and from my Atrix 2 wirelessly. Easy to use software.<br />All you do is open up the app on your phone, then go to the URL it shows using your computer(or even another smartphone/tablet) and you can &#34;upload&#34; and &#34;download&#34; files to and from your phone.
B00B780TAK|1.0|Just finished watching the end of season three, and I'm so mad I wasted my time on this terrible show!! I can't believe they would kill off two of the beloved main characters of the show. Unless by some miracle the one is still alive, but I doubt it. I will not be watching this show next season. Seasons one and two were the best, and it seemed like in three they were just picking absurd scenarios out of a hat.
B004SDEP38|5.0|This is a great productivity Suite.<br /><br />It allows you to open/edit/save/create new Word documents, spreadsheets, and powerpoints easily.<br />It can even connect to your Google Drive, which is a great feature.

B00E8B1P9M|2.0|Silly movie-should have known better. At least I got to watch Tatum. My husband rented it and truthfully I checked out 20 minutes into it.
B00A285OOW|5.0|This particular P Gregory books delves into the mystery of the two little princes that disappeared from the Tower of London around the time of Richard III (who has been blamed by many for their deaths). I enjoy Gregory's writing because it is descriptive, well-written, and the plot flows well. This is definitely my favorite- I could not put the book down, and thought about it when I was not reading it. I cannot remember details of the War of the Roses, or Cousins' War, and find myself googling information while reading, both to ascertain the accuracy of the information of the novel, and to read more about the people themselves. This book makes me want to go back and reread the books she has written during this period again, back to back, and any others of this period by similar historical fiction writers.
B005SLS3ZU|4.0|Enjoyed this book immensely.The twist at the end was great!Caught me out completely.Really enjoyed the character of M Halley<br /> as a lawyer.
B00846REIS|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone that likes sex and romance! This book is very exciting and has you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen with the two of them next. Very great book
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is surprisingly addicting and very entertaining for a free game! I highly recommend this to everyone. really great free game. install and play now!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I've had it for about a year now.  Has yet to let me down.  Fits my 17 inch hp envy, with the 9 cell (larger) battery.  Side pockets are kinda small and long, hard to get things in and out of.

030758836X|3.0|I am not a person that usually writes reviews but I was so unsatisfied by the ending of this book I just had to warn others!  I was very intrigued by the first half of the book, the second half was pretty good, but I feel downright cheated by the very end of the book.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|James sure does know how to make a girl laugh. She also knows how to mix `hearts & flowers', with red hot scenes, with comedic relief to create a story that you can't help but enjoy. James writes this installment in her series with the same intense yet light writing style that she began with. The two books flow quite well together to such an extent that you could read them as a single long novel. That said, they also do work very well as two separate stories, with just enough background information at the beginning of this story to remind you what had happened previously. James actually works necessary background information in throughout the story without breaking the story's flow. She ensures that her readers are never left confused or wondering.<br /><br />The female lead is such a strong person. In some ways she's someone that you want to be like, in others, she is completely naive and in need of some serious guidance. I appreciate that she is neither perfect nor a complete fruitcake. James has created a happy medium in this character. She is also a brilliant counterpoint to the very intense and extreme male lead. I also appreciate the fact that, although they do both change to work together as a couple the ultimately remain true to who they were. You get to know them so well that you find yourself enmeshed in their emotional turmoil. I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that there was much more effort put into the development of the supporting cast in this installment of the novel. It makes the entire novel seem much more believable.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great follow up to Fifty Shades of Grey. It wraps up everything in and of itself nicely, while still giving an opening to the final installment in the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome...it is super fun I loved it!!!! The graphics aren't bad either...there's never a time that I play this game and don't laugh....it's a great game for kids and adults
B007SGM084|4.0|This was a quite interesting trilogy. Take a look at my more in depth look at each of the novels:<br /><br />~*~ Fifty Shades of Grey ~*~<br /><br />The problem with novels that have taken the world by storm is how difficult it is to write a review after reading them. As a reader, you've spent so much time hearing about the novel, both the good and the bad, that you have to sort your own thoughts out from those of others, attempting not to weigh your every idea against those.<br /><br />This novel is quite simply written but it adds to the aura of the story. James uses very intricate descriptions as a counterpoint to her functional, yet flowing writing style. The simple, natural flow of the novel is also shaken up with the linguistics used by the characters in the dialogue. Being well educated individuals this didn't seem out of place, but rather flowed naturally with the story.<br /><br />This author definitely has a way with emotions. James had me giggling and intrigued right from the get go. I don't remember the last time that I laughed so hard. I also don't remember the last time that my heart broke like this for not just one, but two characters in a novel. I wore my heart on my sleeve throughout this novel. It was brilliant.<br /><br />The main characters in this novel were very interesting individuals. One is willing to do anything for a love that the other doesn't believe exists. I was completely caught up in their relationship, even if it was utterly ridiculous at times. And even if there are things that you'd like to know about the main characters, they'd like to know them about each other so you don't feel left out.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this novel. It was interesting and thought provoking. It was also captivating, enthralling, and endearing.<br /><br />~*~ Fifty Shades Darker ~*~<br /><br />James sure does know how to make a girl laugh.

James has the ability to spell things out in a scene without the story lagging or breaking pace. She also does flashbacks and switches in time in a manner that allows the reader to keep pace. Onenever feels like there is a missing gap in time, nor that that there is something missing.<br /><br />Although a million and one awful things happen to these characters, as a reader you never become bored. James ensures that she doesn't double back on the same situations over and over again. Each scenario has an element of newness and of plausibility. It's very easy to immerse yourself in these novels.<br /><br />My favourite part of the novel (and the series) was definitely the emails between the characters. Not only do they provide insight into the characters that you don't see otherwise, but they are comical. They are amongst the most insightful pieces of information available when it comes to the relationship between the main characters.

B003H6KRIE|4.0|I got them because I am a huge fan of this trilogy. Extra material is great.<br /><br />I played them on my PS3 and works fine, without any inconvenience. Video quality is improved from the DVD versions. Recommended for all fans of this kind of movies, and in general for movie fans.<br /><br />Javier
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Love, love, love this CD! I bought it because of the song Like a Star that was played at the end of the movie &#34;27 Dresses&#34; The other songs are great too! A great buy!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|It's a good show. There are interesting characters in it with a good story plot, and there is no vulgarity in it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely love this book. Could not put it down.<br />Christian and Ana`s love story captured my attention from th  beginning and the ending was breathtaking.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I have rented the part one and two before purchasing and all I can say is that they are amazing. Definitely two of the best animated Batman movies to date. Don't bother renting just get it!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Great game but it needs more games like it. If you could do that it would be even better!!! Thx a lot.
B006Y9BULE|5.0|So, I am actually a watch collector with numerous Rolex, Breitling, IWC, Panerai, etc. watches in my collection.  I bought this for a trip to Europe to avoid the concern of theft.<br /><br />Feels as good on my wrist as watches that have cost me thousands.  Sounds silly but true.  Nice weight, nice bulky size, nice look and nice feel on the wrist.<br /><br />WARNING:  Taking out links is a royal pain and should only be done by a pro or if you know what you are doing.  It has tiny (and I mean tiny) posts that goes over the pin that are easy to lose and require a tweezer to hold.  In my opinion, bad design.<br /><br />Despite that flaw, great watch for the money.<br /><br />Hope this review helps.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awsome especialy the up grade and just got 100000coins there's a-lot of characters even tricky and tagbot
B0064MGU98|4.0|great story - wonderful actors - we are loving the development of the characters and the story. look forward to more seasons.
B003F46RVO|5.0|I was in high school in the 80s so I am NOT a Twilight fan.  The Lost Boys were my kind of vampires - party all night, sleep all day, wear really cool clothes.  Great humor and the music - AHH!  LOVED the soundtrack!  This is not a movie to be taken seriously - this is a movie meant to be enjoyed!  So get out your leg warmers and your California Coolers and sit back to enjoy the show.
B00BX8PG4S|5.0|Duchovny and Harris are in top form as rival Russians on a sub in 1968, with DD's character having a different agenda and trying to bring down the captain, who has a checkered past as well as epilepsy.<br /><br />Great suspense!
020530902X|5.0|I love that it is concise and to the point.  It has also brought to the fore some common mistakes that could be made when writing basic English and was careful to give the correct version.
B00DW475CC|5.0|This movie is simply a classic!  I cannot get enough of this!! Loretta Young is exquisite and Cary Grant is very charming.  David Niven is incredible and Elsa Lanchester is simply at her best!  This picture truly warms the heart!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|best trilogy ever made!im reading it for the second time and its still super exciting!hope a 4th book comes out some day! P.S iv always wanted to play in a hunger games movie!looks sooo much fun! :-)
B003V1WXKU|5.0|You don't have to know anything about physics to delve into the genius and quirky mind of Feynman and love it.
B0082PR9H2|5.0|I am so amazed about the knowledge I gain by reading Mr. Brown's books.  I have recommended this book to one of my co-workers and even went so far as to buy it for her.  That's how much I know she will enjoy this highly informative and action packed novel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|At first, I didn't want to watch this show...I didn't know anything about it.  I had heard everyone talking about it though.  Then, one day, I watched an episode with a family member who was visiting and ever since then I have been a HUGE fan, now, I just wish they would hurry up with Season 4 already!!
B0012GTZC0|3.0|He is one of my favorite writers and this book was just average. This probably means the book is a lot better than most books out.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I didn't have a chance to buy this movie before Disney put it the vault.  But, definetely wanted it for my kids.  Finally found it on Amazon, shipped perfectly in brand new packaging.  My boys love it!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I normally don't buy DVDs off of amazon just because I don't like to wait for them to arrive. However, this is my all time favorite movie and I lost my old copy so I figured the wait would be worth it. Honestly, this arrived way faster than expected. Like, two days after ordering it on a Friday.<br /><br />The disc is in perfect condition and came nicely packaged. I will be buying from this seller again for sure!
B0020BUWX2|3.0|I read this book because it was on a list of books to read before they become movies. I thought this book was good. It was a short book, but a slow read. There was nothing that kept me engaged enough to not want to put it down. I'm glad I read it but it will not be added to my favorites list.
B007EC27QM|5.0|a great app for the money. A must have and really handy with the large calculator feel. just really good
B008N1V11U|5.0|Fist fights are epic along with association moves get this app!<br />oh and there are no glitches what so ever
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had zombies in it before then when I was playing more I notice there was no zombies in the survival mode :( pleease somebody help.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|This is a great series- medieval with all of its violence- If you thought work people could be ruthless- check out these individuals
B005LJK3AC|3.0|This movie really didn't do anything for me.  It wasn't the worst thing I have ever seen but wasn't that good either.  The stream quality was very good though
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice challenge.  Its intetesting finding all the tools and clues to solve the puzzels. I look toward to more levels.
B006O5Y75Y|4.0|When I was a kid I always liked the planet of the apes movies.  This movie was pretty good.  The stream quality was very good, both picture and sound.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Can't wait for the next one. Really loved the dynamic between the two main characters.  I've always been interested in learning more about Kaleb.
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|We all know that this film is not historically accurate.  In all reality what that comes out of Hollywood is. (See a lot of bad reviews because of that).  That being said this is still an excellent movie.  The first time I seen it years ago I could not look away.<br /><br />This is one of the if not the best movie I have ever seen.  Well written and well directed.  This is a must have for anybody's movie library.
B000J5XS3C|3.0|Hissy, even with nothing plugged in but headphones. The advertisement for it claims, \\"..ultra low-noise\\", I just don't hear that. My unit has an annoying hiss, which can be abated somewhat by keeping the MID range (mainly) at \\"0\\" or less. It seems most prominent on the first two channels which have the \\"gain\\" knob. Besides that that, I do like the EQ. A master ON/OFF switch for the unit would be helpful. I would return the unit but I can't do without a mixer right now, plus I figure the replacement mixer could be just as hissy, and I don't want to get into an endless swap. I plan to get a better mixer later, and resell this one. Normally I would not be that concerned about the hiss sound, but I do voice over recording work and require a noiseless background,if possible. Without the hiss, I'd given it 5 stars.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|It was ok.  Nothing I would watch with the family.  The picture and sound from the stream were very good.  Just not that great of a movie
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I decided to buy the book \\"The Fault in our Stars\\" because I've heard all of the rave reviews about the book and it was a great price. \\"The Fault in our Stars\\" is about Hazel meeting a boy named Augustus (Gus for short) at a cancer support group when Augustus came to support his friend Isaac. Hazel & Augustus hit it off right away. They both view the world in an uncommon way. Hazel loves reading and gives Augustus a book to read \\"An Imperial Infliction\\", as it is her favorite. Augustus loves the book, even though I believe he loved it because Hazel loved it. The thing about \\"An Imperial Infliction\\" is that the book just ends in the middle of a sentence, that is the ending. Both Hazel & Augustus want to know what happened because there are so many questions left unanswered. Augustus still has his one wish left from the genies because he is also a cancer survivor. He decides to use his wish for Hazel and take her to Amsterdam to talk with the author of the book in person before Hazel dies from her terminal cancer. While there some very awesome things happen but I don't want to give it away. You HAVE to read this book! I couldn't put it down. It's a very enjoyable read and easily one of my favorite books. Just make sure you have a box of Kleenex by you because your going to need it.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|The movie was not bad but it was predicable,  could see the ending coming.  Wasn't bad and wasn't as good as it could have been.  The stream quality was very good.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I was very skeptical about this book even though I had heard all of the hype. But curiosity got the best of me. It was a great & quick read. I would recommend it to anyone.<br />In this story Alice was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's Disease at the age of 50. Alice always contributed it to just being forgetful & getting older. Alice was an amazing & talented college professor. After the diagnosis the symptoms came on faster & larger. She would forget where the bathroom was, classes and speeches, where she lived, and then her husband and children. It's a story of her family learning to deal with losing their mother and wife one piece at a time. And watching an Alzheimer's patient lose herself.<br />It is a good book and makes you appreciate what you have.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|This game is very much like the game &#34;Lemmings&#34; from years ago.  If you enjoyed Lemming's then you should like this game.  The graphics are much better than the first Bunny Mania and there are more levels now.  The first levels are very easy and then they gradually become more difficult as you progress so you have an opportunity to learn the actions of each function, i.e. tile layers, diggers, stop signs, etc.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|I suppose that I didn't get it.  Except for a few scenes of  childhood behavior that I feel Gaiman nailed, the rest of the book was a waste of time.<br /><br />I finished the book in the hope that a light would dawn for me revealing its genius.  Unfortunately, I remained in the dark.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love that after you read this book once you can skip through the chapter. If you're not feeling up to reading about the French in the Paris sewers you don't have to and the rest of the story still works.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Wonderful on all accounts. Acting, storyline, cinematography, creativity, suspense, all quite excellent, like the other films in the series. LOVED it.
B007PJLUG2|5.0|One of the best funny movie salma make good movie ... I recommended to watch it is really good !!!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|My boys love checking the app to see what's in store for their day!  Living in an area prone for tornadoes, my oldest son knows that he can watch as the storm passes us by. This calms him and I'm thankful for that!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Order a recent movie you might have missed in the theaters.<br />On the spot, from your cauch, charge to your credit card,<br />and in minute the movie starts
0670014893|5.0|I probably will reread  this book. I first read it on my iPad, then my husband's book club selected it, so I will read it again in hardback. John LeCarre is such a fine writer & we do love good spy thrillers.
0634022296|5.0|it is that just simple clean and without more writings on it but lyrics and keys. So easy to follow.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I didn't know what I was getting but my tablet was slowing down.  This worked great cleaning things I thought I had already gotten rid of.
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|What's better than Pride and Prejudice?  Pride and Prejudice with illustrations of course!  The illustrations are beautiful and give the reader a good idea of what the characters, their dress, and the environment may have looked like.  They bring the book to the next level.  I'm not sure I would pay for this book, but for free it's definitely worth it.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful heartwarming real life adventure.  From start to finish, it was entertaining, educational, wonderous and good for the soul.  A beautiful documentary.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I purchased this for my son.  He loves Star Wars and I am very impressed with the shipping.  Thank you.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Very original; the ending is somewhat abrupt (I hate it when that happens). I would have liked to know more about what became of some of the characters, especially Jack's real grandfather. Unusual mix of thought-provoking situations but lacking any profound passages. Of course, this is due to the fact it is narrated by a five year old, yet he seems advanced enough to consider the gravity of the situation. I didn't give it five stars because I thought the ending was bad.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love Minion Rush so much that I can't stop playing! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!! Be Do, Be Do, Be Do, Be Do!!!!!!!!!!
006029129X|5.0|Enjoyable reading with my 15 month old. Will read for many years to come. The book is really cute and we enjoy the illustrations.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've been using it for days and love it. The idea of using the brains of any device you've already paid good money for is awesome. I'm using it all the time for everything, to include music. I'm looking forward to the development of more supported apps. C'mon developers!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie full of action, I had forgotten some of the characters and this helped bring them back. My wife did not enjoy it but she is no fan of super heroes.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|When Amanda changes places with Elizabeth Bennet, things start to go crazy.  Everything goes wrong, nobody does what is expected from the novel Pride and Prejudice and Amanda is like a fish out of water.  Especially funny are the Misters Collins.  Mr. And Mrs. Bennet are more aggressive and Darcy is particularly annoying.  Meanwhile, Elizabeth Bennet has adapted to life in modern London, learned how to use computers and smart phones and cut her hair.  Verry Funny.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Gave a very good account of life in Afghanistan during the war. Liked the story following one family's trials and tribulations.
B000RLW5VO|5.0|He is a Jackson Browne fan. It would make a good addition to anyone's collection of albums. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Awesome game very addicting. Play this game everyday can't wait to see a new one!!!! Keep up the good work...<br />...
0399255370|5.0|I purchased two copies of this book after reading the reviews.  I figured if it was that funny, it would be a good addition to daycare's library as well as our own.  We've all enjoyed this book.  My 4 year old thinks it's hilarious and I've had a lot of fun reading it.  It was a hit in my child's classroom as well.  My 2 year old wasn't so engaged in it but I'm sure in a year or two she'll enjoy it as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is better than temple run and better than subway surfers the fluffy was so brilliant and the different places
B0019CSXAM|5.0|Just as the seasons before it, it's so great. I didn't watch it right away when it came out but got into it later and haven't stopped watching since.  HIMYM provides you with life quotes.. especially as someone in her late 20's.
0385486804|4.0|This book is very unique.  It began with the outcome.  Although the outcome is not very pleasant, it still aroused my curiosity to continue reading.  Some may think that the protagonist is crazy or stupid.  Why would someone who does not lack in food and clothing venture into the wilderness, practically begging for trouble?  But in my view, challenging one's own limitsby returning to nature is nothing bad.  He is simply getting his life back to the most primitive and simple environment.  In the modern competitive life, too many people live in the pursuit of fame and fortune. From another perspective, I think family or friends are very important factors in the decisions one makes.  The protagonist's home lacked warmth and had too much protection, leading to his yearning for freedom.  Also I can discover from the story, human potential is infinite.  In the absence of any reliance, it still can live in a long time.  Although the protagonist died in the end, he left behind a very special experience for him.  Do what you want to do, do what you will not regret.  That is what I learned.
B003DES8I6|3.0|I waited FOREVER for this movie to come and it kinda fell flat.. Just was expecting much more. Don't get me wrong.. It's still great. Just wasn't enough.
1575666286|5.0|Anyone with cancer or if it runs in your family should own this information. There is hope even when cancer strikes. Couldn't recommend it more!!!
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Just as the seasons before it, it's so great. I didn't watch it right away when it came out but got into it later and haven't stopped watching since.  HIMYM provides you with life quotes.. especially as someone in her late 20's.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun i give it a rate of four i think you would like this game to so try it out
B0061S073A|5.0|i really  like this app i got it after my 2 1/2 year old  bought 2 games. it lets him play what i want him to play without the worry that he will buy apps.
B004TN7QPG|5.0|This Is a great reader. It replaced 3 separate apps, and I like it better than any of them. It can read mobi,epub, PDF and CBR plus a few others. It is really great app worth every penny. Moon+ Reader Pro lets me do a folder view so I can organize my large library by types I.E. fiction-sci fi- Heinlein- star ship troopers. A lot easier than tags. It is even faster than Calibre on my PC and the touch control on the zoom is better than a pc. This app has made my tablet my go to for electronic books, magazines and comics.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I found this game very fun and hard to stop playing, it's pretty addictive I've already played for a hour straight , this game is very addictive : )
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game, but trains go trough each other and outfits lag you and you can see a green grid. Very fun, though.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|There are only a few levels shown and none that match my frustrations. I will be deleting this app soon
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Me and my sister watched this movie when we were younger so it was just like riding a bike all over again.  The movie was in great condition brand new lots of options to buy it either DVD or VHS and it was shipped on time arrived early, great distribution.
0544104404|5.0|This book has confirmed what I've  always believed to be true. A person's character is more important than their IQ when measuring a successful life.
0812993845|3.0|I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books, and have enjoyed them, especially the Shopaholic series, so I was looking forward to reading another one of her books, but Wedding Night was not enjoyable.  In all the previous books, there were moments that caused me to laugh out loud, but in Wedding Night, there was nothing remotely amusing.  Wedding Night lacks the wit of Sophie's previous books, and has no interesting twists, turns or coincidences.  I am being generous by giving this book 3 stars.<br /><br />When I first started reading the book, it took me a few minutes to realize that the chapters were changing, with some being a narrative by Lottie, and some being a narrative by her sister, Fliss.  I didn't see much difference between the thought processes of the 2 characters, and Kinsella's attempt to differentiate their personalities is weak.<br /><br />I feel as if Kinsella was under time pressure to write another book, and threw this one together quickly.  The story line is so far-fetched and ridiculous, not to mention predictable.  I hope that Kinsella's next book will be more like her earlier stories, which were fun to read.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Plott too long gets lost midway...<br />Cheating involved ...and not one of Paul Rudds<br />Best .made like an 80's movie.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|So don't read this and think it will be like the movie, not even close. Each has its own merits and I do like both the film and this book. Actually it is on my daughter's summer school reading list. Weird since it is a Catholic school.
B001NLL93W|5.0|The thing I really love about this book is that it keep you at the edge of you seat the whole book when the back of fe booklist says plenty of romance loss honor an betrayal their not joking I say hold on the ones out love in this book because they might be gone before you know it! Shadowhunters unite! Team Jace
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|One of the worst science fiction films I've ever watched.  If you enjoyed any of the previous Aliens films, then this will surely be a disappointment.  Terrible characterization, stupid characters who don't behave like real people.  Simplistic motivations.  Dumb action sequences and an almost incomprehensible plot that one needs a host of apologists to understand.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Well told some surprises at a great read. A stand alone story even though it's part of a series. Loved it.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Cruise comes up short<br /><br />Having read all of the Reacher novels I eagerly awaited the viewing of the first movie.  While I enjoy watching Tom Cruise perform he is no Jack Reacher.  As much as they tried to make him appear tough and gritty he could not pull it off.  Jack Reacher of the novel was a giant of a man-------Cruise just cannot reach that height.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|Not sure if this is an advantage or not, I did like the video but some of the levels are quite challenging!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Great game.  Super addicting.  I couldn't put it down.  Unfortunately there are only a few levels when you are craving more.
B00181YT9S|1.0|I happened to have a cord from an old synth that I cut down to fit. Why on Earth would a product selling in the USA have a European plug? Nuts!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use.  Always syncs if you are reading between devices.  I have three, so its always syncing!  Would recommend this app!
B0098460O4|3.0|I really expected more, was not crazy of the selections chosen for the album except two. Thought you could have gone with some more popular selections..
0307352153|5.0|If you have ever put your hands over your ears and wanted to yell........<br />this book is for you.<br />For the introvert in an &#34;extrovert's world&#34; as Cain proposes, this book<br />will be an eye-opener for lots of people and will confirm what those<br />same people have &#34;known&#34; about their lives for years.<br />Introverts are a slightly different breed<br />Great read.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The chapter set up and break down, writing, explanations, and resoning all made sense, were easy to follow, and REALLY worked! Thank you!
B0026RHR6K|5.0|Have been looking for this complete box set for a while and it is even better than I thought.  Watched it all in about a week, and will break it out and watch it again this winter.  Super good fun.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I think everyone should read this.  It is interesting and very enjoyable.  It tells of a time long gone.  Go back in time and enjoy.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Great movie a classic watch over and over Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer give masterful performances should have done a follow up
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so awesome u like dodge trains and pick up speacail things u also get daily changles and minsons u should so get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1451695195|5.0|This author is a brain surgeon, so he understands what happens when the brain is completely dead.  He experienced a week of total brain unconsciousness and by miracle and prayer came back.  His amazing journey in Heaven proves what really is in store for us.  Very helpful for those of us who have lost our beloved ones.  Thank you, Dr. Alexander.
1589944607|5.0|Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is the most paranoia-inducing game I've ever played, hands down. You don't have to have watched the science fiction TV show to love this frenzy of card-playing and wild accusation! Set in a galaxy where humans are almost extinct, you've got to figure out who among you are the evil cylons--who are almost certainly sabotaging your team and trying to sow doubt among the group.<br /><br />I love this game most for the social part, but there is plenty of strategy as you figure out how to best play your skill cards, use resources, and overcome the inevitable crises that occur throughout the game. Even non board-gamers will have a blast, as many of my friends will attest!
034580404X|5.0|I have read the first two so far and look forward to finishing the last one.  You feel like you really<br />get to know Ana and Christian and this is the first time I have cried reading a book and there are<br />parts that are funny as well.  If you are not comfortable reading about their sex life, then these<br />books may not be for you, as it does go in detail quite a bit.  I see it as maybe giving me a few<br />ideas! ;)  Great books though, wish there were more in the series.
B004YCKK6Y|5.0|The movie is great.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in a movie the keeps you laughing until the end.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|finished this book in 3 days. its so well written and has such a unique storyline it actually inspired me to begin writing my own novel again! great read no matter what your age that will have you running to the kindle store and downloading the next one at 2 in the morning
0896898288|5.0|Love the patterns and the book.  Not necessarily good for a newbie but an experienced quilter can figure it out.  The patterns are on disk and one per page when printing so is kind of a waste of paper.  Many blocks can be done just by measurements.  Our group had one very smart lady that sorted them out buy types of blocks and made it much easier.  She even finished her quilt and was accepted to enter in in the 2013 Paducah Quilt Show.  She's in her 80's and had hand quilted it.  Her's was beautiful and she's helping the rest of us.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|I'd have to say that I finally found a Johnny Depp movie that I couldn't watch.  I tried, lord I tried but I found this movie boring and horribly written.  Sorry Johnny but this one is a real stinker
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Classic game with a new take. Love it! It's accessibility on the go is great. Great for road trips, or even down time between classes.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|If you're a fan of mid to late 70s Genesis, you'll love this album.  Fantastic sounding new Prog Rock that is worth listening to again and again. Will be touring the US in 2014...go see them!!
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|This was a great story, well written and I learnt a lot about flowers and their meanings in a really enjoyable way.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Limitations need to be UP FRONT.  And not even competitive.  If you give me 1000 REAL games, fine or whatever.
0553801473|5.0|Very good read. Ready to see the 4th season on television. The anticipation is killing me. Ready for the next book.
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|Skagen watches are a good value.  They are thin - so you don't look like you have a pocket watch strapped to your arm. You will not impress any poseurs, but they look OK and keep accurate time.  Despite the name, the watches are made in China.  While there's a &#34;lifetime&#34; guarantee the shipping & handling fees are likely more than a used watch is worth.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|You have to see this movie especially b/c there is a sequel. I'm young and I love that all the actors are pretty mich 50 and up. It gives me something to look forward to later in life :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a really adorable somewhat addicting game. The animation is great and quite realistic. I would however like to be able to do more in the care of the horse than have the clock ticking down the time. I do enjoy playing this game.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My 11 year old son loves this game . We also seen the movie and it was pretty you know amazing.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Rough for me to watch in places, I felt this was a very accurate protrayal of combat the South Pacific in WW II. They took the time to get the equipment and weapons right and put it in the large scale context that you can miss in a book. It increases my respect for the Marines who fought and died during these campaigns. Very good use of the book With the Old Breed.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A wonderful book. I had to put it down for a couple days after the accusation, finding it too painful, but finally resumed reading.knowing such wonderful characters had to triumph. I loved Enzo, the philosopher dog...and I am not really a dog person.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|Very difficult to set up.  I gave up and went elsewhere to a user-friendly site.  Don't bother with this unless you like frustration.
0425252868|5.0|This was great book!!!!!  I liked that it started out with the author doing a little autobio first.  Couldn't put it down, found myself with happy tears 40 odd years later.  A great read
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Excellent functionality, intuitive, complete file management tool - would be lost without this app on my LG android phone (and my Kindle Fire, too); plus, unlike a lot of apps out there, have had no probs with unstable updates
B00AYB1KHW|3.0|I never finished watching it.  It's kind of a waste of time with the usual unarmed, helpless teachers who are left to the mercy of evil.  I don't buy into that mindset at all, so it didn't really suspend my disbelief.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got hooked watching the first 2 seasons and had a lot of trouble finding the 3rd season.  So I was glad to see it on amazon.com. So easy to purchase
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Kind of try and ignore the first part of the first episode, but it's kind of important character stuff. It gave me a super cheesy sci-fi vibe when I ran across it flipping channels (before I knew what it was) and I just continued on. Luckily I found the show some other way and enjoyed what little of it there is.
0525425772|5.0|John Grisham does it again.  This is a delightful book for all ages with a special meaning to teens who believe in the justice system and are not afraid to stand up for what is right, regardless of the negativity surrounding their cause.  I highly recommend all the Theodore Boone series of books by John Grisham.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I really enjoy the upbeat songs and sounds of Tegan and Sara AND this CD will not disappoint you! Good stuff!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I disagree with all of the people ripping Ms. Harris a new one over this. Yes, there's a huge cast of characters and yes many of them get short shrift here, but in the end it's Sookie's series and her arc from 'freak' to self- and public-acceptance is well completed (I did miss Bubba, though!)
B009WUBERW|4.0|Good old &#34;fun&#34; action violence against the bad guys.  Justice done the old fashioned way with no courts (and no acknowledgement that there is any such thing as a true American/Constitutional court in the world...), just direct action.  The typical foreshortened reasoning of those who lack a developed pre-frontal cortex, which is why it's just plain old-fashioned &#34;American&#34; (or not) fun.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This was a great movie and I would highly recommend it . Always kept me wondering what was going to happen next
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Better than the first. A fun film, but no masterpiece.<br />Much more along the comic book and 1980s television cartoon in terms of story line... which is a good thing.<br /><br />SPOILER alert:  a lot of Joes die in this film.<br />And Cobra Commander is played by a new actor; no more J. Gordon Levitt, while Destro is mentioned but never really seen.

140006922X|5.0|For the past decade, I had read from cover-to-cover no more than a handful of books.<br /><br />Reza Aslan's book aroused my curiosity and made me want to learn more about the origins of Jesus. The way the book is laid out makes it easier for a non-reader like me to enjoy and see things from a different lens.<br /><br />As a Christian I do not find the views provocative. While the ideas are not new (so I was told), it really is like a Harry Potter remix to the age old stories of the Gospel in the bible. I really enjoyed it.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|My first Kate Morton book. She is a genius to have created this incredibly intricate story - a little girl lost and how it took three generations of family to unravel her roots.<br /> I cannot fathom how she did not get herself lost in the turns and twists of the tale. The stories of the characters are like small streams winding through the mountains. The story eventually becomes a river flowing into the sea.<br />It's a mystery story of good and evil and the complexity of human reactions to adversity.<br />The characters are so well painted (described is too weak a word) that each one was alive and vibrant as I read. The plot is intriguing and it's impossible to guess the dramatic end.<br />In the beginning, I disliked the way she shifted the story backwards and forwards in time. I did, however, get used to it and now I like the way she assembled this complex story.<br />And I really liked the way she kept me guessing.
B00BTHV05M|4.0|Having experienced Dreaming Out Loud, followed by Waking Up, I was a little skeptical of how good their third album could be. Although I don't think it's as good as the first two, it's still a solid album.

030758836X|3.0|The technique the author employed to tell the story worked well. It gave the reader a clear unobstructed view of the two narrative lines. The story was engaging and entertaining, but ultimately, I had difficulty believing some of Amy's actions and Nick's inability to reach some resolution for his situation. To satisfy my desire for a better ending, I envisioned Nick in a hospital waiting room having to decide between saving the life of his unborn son or his persecutor. Wouldn't that be an easy decision?

B001ANSSDC|3.0|A messed up story. But like watching a train wreck, I could not put it down.  These characters are the most bizarre, dysfunctional characters you will ever read about!
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Vienna, the beginning of the 20th century, just before WWI. What wouldn't I give to visit that place to see for myself the so-called \\"Golden Age\\" of the center of European science and philosophy, arguably the most liberal place in Europe, where the seeds of the modern ideas of ethnic and religious equality first sprouted and were actually implemented.<br /><br />Of course, just because the government declares a degree of \\"equality\\" of the races and religions, it doesn't mean the populous will follow. It usually takes a few generations for people to take to these new ideas. How the prevalent nationality treats the minorities in their midst and how much the minorities are willing to assimilate is a litmus test on how tolerant the country really is.<br /><br />The emigration inside of, and to and from the Austro-Hungarian Empire created a venerable \\"melting pot\\" of people of different beliefs and nationalities, most of whom recognized themselves not as members of a certain specific group but as citizens of the nation, especially in large cities as Vienna. Of course, there were some notable exceptions. The larger the degree of freedom the state provides for its citizens, the more powerful some nationalistic, religious, or ideological movements can become. When Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Habsburg throne, was assassinated by a Serbian student in Sarajevo, it didn't come to anyone as a great shock--political assassination by more radical groups were common in that era.<br /><br />However, I digress. This book is a story that is centered around Sebastian Schreiber, an only son of non-practicing, well-assimilated Jewish family, that made a very decent life for themselves after immigrating to Vienna quite some while ago. Schreibers are hard-working and industrious, and at the time the novel starts, Sebastian's father, Franz, and mother, Vera, are running a grocery shop that is being frequented by people of varied nationalities and religions. Sebastian's grandfather, Oscar, and grandmother Rebecca, are of ill health and are living with the family.<br /><br />At 16 years of age, Sebastian had an accident that leads to an amputation of his leg, leaving him incapable of the hard labor that is required to be a successful grocery shop-keeper, as his father wanted him to be. The accident was rather prosaic--stepping on a rusty nail. The consequences of it were as dramatic as one would imagine. Perhaps, if the WWI would have never started, the lives of Sebastian's family would not have been changed so drastically, who knows. However, the Austro-Hungarian Empire did enter a war and the lives of Schreibers were never the same.<br /><br />Interestingly, Sebastian does not appear as an \\"active\\" character much throughout the novel. Much of the time we follow the story through the eyes of Vera, his mother; sometimes we switch to certain secondary characters. In that, he reminds me of Pierre Bezukhov from \\"War and Piece\\"--things happen around Sebastian, sometimes with him in the center, but not with him as the truly active player. Not to say that he is not integral to the story. However, as I read it, the novel is more about how the war affects society on an example of one group of people, in this case Schreiber family, and people connected to them.<br /><br />Through the novel, some characters disappear, like Franz, who was recruited to fight in the war, and new ones make an appearance, like Mathilde, a well-off friend of Vera's, whose active mind makes for an interesting exploration of philosophical, social, and scientific ideas of the time. Also, we have several maids who enter Schreiber household and who play important roles in the story as well. The third maid, Margit, is the most important to how the narrative progresses and as such, she is the most interestingly written.<br /><br />The book edges on \\"Literary Realism.\\" No character or idea is romanticized and characters are humanly fallible people who are trying to act intheir self-interest, be it foolishly sometimes. While I was reading this book, I could not stop making parallels with \\"War and Peace.\\" \\"Sebastian\\" is, in my opinion, a book about how a war changes people and the society. There's a tiny bit of a \\"conclusion\\" of sorts at the end of the book, in a dialog between Sebastian and one of his friends (no spoilers):<br /><br />\\"Many men who are returning from the war have changed and they come home to even more changed women. There comes a time when one needs to let go of the past and live in the present.\\"<br /><br />I think this pretty much says what the book is all about.<br /><br />A very good read from a fast-emerging name in historical novels. Recommended.their self-interest, be it foolishly sometimes.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|This movie won't change your life, but it is a lot of fun.  A great &#34;Friday Pizza/Movie&#34; Night flic!  (adult fun that is.  very violent.  not for little kids)
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|We used this dual-port car charger for a 10-hour road trip, and it worked great!  Thanks so much, and having two ports works great.  Very easy.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|World War Z is fun to read and the flashback interview plot is interesting but not enough to really draw you in.  The pages are filled with cliches and half-baked satire on modern cultures.  Max Brooks's portrayal of women characters is laughable - he attempts to show women in an admirable light but ends up being insincere.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the zombie genre or is looking for an easy summer read.  If you read a lot of books, you may see through his prose and not enjoy it.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I enjoyed the majority of the book.  I found the immersion on the details of the world before 1962 fascinating.  A lot of attention was awarded to the events that led to the day in Dallas... however the book seemed to fall apart after that.  Although we have all heard how altering the past could have disastrous circumstances, I felt cheated as to what positives could have come from it.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Everyone has seen at least one Bond movie, but not everyone knows that Ian Fleming, the creator of 007 was a real life spy. Even if you did, Damian Stevenson's research and daring storytelling provide for an exciting and fascinating read.<br /><br />The author introduces us to the extraordinary characters that populated Fleming's life while painting the scenes as if he were there himself. He gives details that make you smell the smoke and taste the cocktails and yet, never lets them slow the action.<br /><br />It's quite a trick for an author to combine historical events, dialogue that sounds like he secretly tape-recorded the conversations, and action that never lets up but Stevenson has done it! Highly recommended to everyone.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|This movie was horrible.  Thought it was going to be funny and ended up hating it.  The characters were pathetic and their lives were extremely boring.
B0012GMW3Y|5.0|I love this record.<br /><br />I've downloaded it twice. I've got a mono sacd version , a vinyl mono version and this stereo cd version.<br />It's unique in the byrds canon and has a haunting and sublime quality all it's own.<br />It's the sound you should hear as you wake blinking into sunlight shards thru still closed blinds.<br />The first track is a hoot, the second aches and there's weirdness too along the way. The sound of growing up from idealistic 60s into a disillusioned Vietnam dominated future as the years roll on to the 1970s: dead rock stars, Fab Four disbanded, altamount, bad vibes and paradise lost: it's one unifying theme; the sound of gentle beauty<br />I love this record.<br />steve wilkinson: somewhere in middle England uk

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Wonderful game. The problem is it forces you to log into facebook...  It's annoying and the time waiting for free tokens are 45 minutes just to get on average 3.5 coins. It's sad to be honest. Other than that, It's a must have game. Nostalgic.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|It has elements of Star Wars , Enemy Mine and Indiana Jones (thematically), so how could it bomb ?!? Good , entertaining with a few twists and plenty of action !
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Lots of characters which is fine.  But way too much discussion between them.  Game would be better with less dialogue.  At times the required task to complete is confusing.  Almost like some direction was omitted.<br /><br />Please come up with a game that is NOT about magic, demons and / or spirits.  Perhaps a new under the sea creature or a lost historical item.  Seems like all the good games are about the occult or are gory.  Thank you.

B000JLSM00|5.0|John Wayne's finest performance and without question the greatest western ever made. I've seen it on VHS,Laserdisc,DVD,HD-DVD,and Blueray over the years. I remember a scene in one format where Wayne rides off to locate the first daughter and finds her body in a valley and buries her with his coat. I can't remember which format this \\"missing\\" scene was in but I suspect the Laserdisc. Anybody else remember this missing scene and which format it was? A word about negative reviews. The current generation was raised on CGI and buckets of blood and can be forgiven for not understanding great storytelling and great acting.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I have always loved to cook and have a science background....finally a book about cooking that makes sense. I have been cooking for more than 50 years, but I have learned a lot about what is going on when we cook food and why we have a need to do it. It is fascinating, but completely understandable even if you have no science background/interest.
B000FP2OPY|3.0|Every episode had a patternistic rythm and structure. The paternalism and the sibling moments are meant to drive the action and make the characters endearing. The open road, the rock music, the road trips with just you and your brother with the wind at your back and an old american classic muscle car roaring underneath your balls and no need for money or legal reprucussions. This was not for me and I forced myself to watch all 22 episodes and it was more than a chore.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is so super fun . it makes you think but I wish it had more levels like at least 100

B009VMN3RA|5.0|I've read quite a lot of celebrity autobiographies, but this may be my very favorite.  It's extremely well-written.  Sachi's co-writer really is a hell of a good writer -- I couldn't put it down.  And it's exactly the right length -- it doesn't go into a ton of unnecessary detail.  It tells you what you need to know, and then moves on without leaving you feeling like you need more details.  I finished it faster than any book in recent memory.<br /><br />Sachi has had a fascinating life.  I had expected I'd find the \\"non-MacLaine\\" parts of the book boring, but I did not.  They were VERY interesting.  And I loved that Sachi reveals the popular \\"channeler\\" Kevin Ryerson as a hoaxter.  (You'll have to read the book to find out how Sachi found out... it's towards the end of the book.)  It's really amazing that Shirley MacLaine, who is usually so skeptical and suspicious about people, can be so very, very gullible when it comes to anything related to spirituality.  The only thing I found lacking is that I wish, as a few others have said, she'd talked about her grandparents.  Did she have no relationship with them at all?  They are barely mentioned in the book, and she has no personal stories about them at all.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app easy to use. Simple big keys no extra junk to deal with. You can check back and see your last few steps easily. Just a great App.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is a nice game. You won't rave about it but it is a pleasant way to pass time. The constant talking does get old especially since so little of it applies to what you are doing.

074401493X|3.0|I wanted to find all the trophies for this game. But once I got it and started looking through it, I noticed that it really wasn't that helpful. Finding the Firefly Pendants was the first I was going for, but the guide didn't really help with it. I found Youtube was a better choice. It you just want a guide, pick it up, but if you want it for help, you'll get just a very very basic guide. But hey, at least you'll get a Firefly keychain.
0399255370|5.0|Our 4 and 6 year old LOVE this book. The kids have each page memorized by the color of the crayon. Peach crayon is our favorite. We have to take it with us places so we can share with other kids. It sparks many conversations about colors, espcially orange. We are trying to find the perfect job for orange crayon because we beleive that yellow is the true color of the sun. Thank you for such a delightful and creative sparking book.

B0070UFMOW|4.0|Just received this today, have to say, it doesn't make a big difference when use with iPhone. Almost want to return it right the way. (I usually do not return things if it at least can do something for me), So i tried to use it as a DAC with my Macbook air, after compared very carefully, i found that it actually does something. More details of music can be heard, clarity improved a little bit and so far thats what keep me to not return it.<br /><br />BTW, i am using it with my Sol Republic tracks HD, which kind of lack the Highs and Mids, i lower the bass and turn up the treble with E17, it helped. Anyway, i ordered an Sol Republic tracks Ultra, going to test it again with that, which described has more highs and mids.<br /><br />Finally, I am just being honest and maybe E17 will does more things when using it with more expensive headphones, from my point of view, if i had a chance to try it first, i wouldn't buy it. not because it is not good, it just i don't benefit from it that much.<br /><br />Hope this can help you to make your choice.^ ^
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is awesome. Play as many levels as you want without waiting to &quot;spend&quot; or &quot;buy&quot; more lives.  Hours of entertainment to pass the time.  If you love mahjong...this game for you!

There are many things in the book that would not have necessarily worked in the movie version.  I would like to see a follow up movie that shows what happens beyond the great ending of the movie!

B005LAIIJY|4.0|The dialogue was great in this movie.  Had to overlook some of the violence, and the unjust protrayed, but it is a movie afterall.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I tried it out; it was a good deal more challenging than I expected.  However, if you are pretty good at chess or other plan-ahead things, you will enjoy it.
0345803450|4.0|Is this a satire?  Everyone seems to get skewered in this droll, faux-spy novel from the M1-5, to academics, to literature prize judges, to book reviewers to novelists.  Everyone is fair game. Each character is available to Ian McEwan's intellect and wit to be a clever cliche.<br /><br />One writing instructor said authors like to prove how smart they are.  McEwan accomplishes that in this book, not that there was any doubt about that. But still it's fun to be reminded that top intellect exists and is available to us to amuse.  None of the characters in this novel seemed quite real.  They were parodies.  The novel is clever, original and imaginative.  I especially enjoyed McEwan's sensibility of the world of books.  He is also adroit at assuming the way a character might converse with the back story and mindset he created for them.<br /><br />The novel lacked a bit of heart which was probably intentional.  Can you love a book when you don't particularly like anyone in it?  I'm amused, impressed, amazed by it, but can't love it. That may be a lack of imagination on my part. At times I didn't want to finish it as the story or characters weren't compelling to me, but the writing technique and mind behind it was. The novel is clever entertainment and you are able to see talent at work.  That isn't easily found and makes it worthy reading -- if you've got a sweet tooth for that kind of thing.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded this game on my kindle fire it goes as far as to play the little movie in the beginning but after that is done it says loading and it takes a long time nothing comes up after that it just says loading even when the kindle fire goes off when I turn it back on its back to the same page that says loading I deleted the game and downloaded it back several times and it just does the same thing so I decided to try it on my phone I downloaded the game and it works perfectly on my phone but why will it not work on my kindle fire I don't wont it on my phone because I really don't want my little one to be playing on my phone if you can fix this problem with this game working on the kindle fire it will be ok thank you.

B005DJREGQ|4.0|Well done tennee bopper coming of age series.  Characters grow on you. It's like the House WIves of Palos Verde (Teeneagers of Palos Vede)
B0062OCNAI|4.0|The story held my attention but I could put it down.  Very good but not excellent.  I would love a sequel.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Absolutely hilarious movie.  My wife and I saw it in the theater and knew we had to own it.  Great Christmas gift.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This Mahjong tablet edition has a good variety of playing designs, as well as playing levels. I would recommend buying it.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I totally enjoyed this CD in its entirety, her music is incredible, I'm going to purchase all of her music soon!
B004132I20|5.0|This version of The Sherlock Holmes stories is Fantastic both Cumberbatch and Freeman are great actors and work extremely well together. The only problem I see is that there should be more and more of these two in more and more Holmes stories.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|This is a fun movie. I liked the retro game references which the kids didn't get, buy we were all amused. This is a good family flick.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I had a blast playing this!  I started out by naming  my disease  and picking a country to start infecting ...then I used my points to mske it more infectious....I was able to see the country slowly turn red and I saw infected ships and planes go to other countries!  Shared with my 13yr old son and he can't wait to try it.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|As a child of the 80's I loved this movie.  My wife and I can't wait to see the show.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like the game however now that I did the update they only give 4 power ups for 1000 coins.  When I first started playing they would give 7 power ups for 1000.  That's not fair.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I totally enjoyed this CD in its entirety, her music is incredible, I'm going to purchase all of her music soon!
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|I enjoyed this classic, if you haven't seen this movie watch it you will like it. that is all .
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|I loved the book(s), but they did fair justice with the movie. This story is inspiring and enlightening! I was happy with my purchase.
0062511408|5.0|I keep it in by my bed, for me it's a book filled with wisdom and every time I read it, it somehow tells me what I need, I love it!
B000I3W1XS|5.0|this is my all time favorite star trek.  The story is ingrossing and the acting is superb. All the old tv stars are back and true to the characters we have all grown to love.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|before the recent update with Machos Lair, this game was a lot of fun. Now, it won't load after the mini-movie. My daughter had purchased tokens with money she had saved up, since she is too young for facebook and that is what a large portion of the missions are for. If your child doesn't have facebook, they will get stuck on missions- definitely.<br />Now, she is very upset since she paid money and cannot access the game. Hard lesson- thanks Amazon for teaching it to her.<br />I blame Amazon because it loaded with absolutely no issue from the tootle play store onto my phone. However, I think she will lose everything if I sideload it.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|I've been enjoying the various tasks and gameplay modes, reminds me of a cross between Monster Rancher and Jade Cocoon. However...<br /><br />Making money is a slow, tedious task when you have to feed, train, and play with each monster, and each action costs a minimum of 100 coins, BUT, your 'attractions' only bring in miniscule amounts, especially when you're low level. 24 coins is the best one I've got. I've been trying for 3 days to save up 3000 coins and I still have less than a thousand, due to monster care. Very frustrating.<br /><br />Also, I'm unimpressed by the prices for in-game currency. It's a GAME, for God's sake, and we're in a RECESSION. Wake up, get your greed in check.
B00BIPORC8|5.0|This is one of the best, smartest, and riveting series I have seen....I can't stop watching it! Amazing plot line.
B00C2AXDAU|5.0|I had heard that this guy was good, so I rolled the bones and bought this album, my first (but not last) by him. I could not be happier, this is an excellent album. Very mellow, melodic and magnificent. No real weak tracks and once you start listening, it is very likely that you will listen to it three or four times in a row. Sample the tracks, you will like it. Then you should buy it.
0143038419|5.0|Wonderful story of a person finding beauty within themselves. Great for anyone going through a turning point in life. Great.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I am not a fan of buying TV series, but I made an exception for this one because it's so hilarious that I know on a boring day I can pop in a DVD and make it better. I have never found a TV show this entertaining. Love the whole gang!
B002VCR08U|4.0|I enjoyed reading the account of the relationship between Frank Lloyd Wright, his wife and children and the complex relationship with Mamah and her husband and family.  Their parallel lives are depicted in a well written way and the influence of the Womens Movement in the early 20th century is evident.  Written from Mamah's perspective, the book is enjoyable from a travel viewpoint, portraying life in Berlin, Italy etc at that time as Frank and Mamah journeyed  together both pursuing their personal and professional goals in a very complex way. A good read and recommended.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I loved this when it was first on TV and love it now. The Star Trek family is great and I miss a new series
B0089G09SU|5.0|Beyond the erotic passages D.H.provides a strong social commentary on class and feminism. Well worth reading and enjoying his profound and lyrical writing.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Great book, however the ending was predictable and rushed. I'm excited to see how the movie compares to the book.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Once I started this book was hard to put down. It is a wonderful story that started exciting and never let up. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I liked it, it was funny, sweet, and interesting. I thought Jennifer Lopez was great, and it gives a good story line about having kids.
B0061S0A64|5.0|TOOK A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT DOWN PACK BUT ITS GREAT FOR THOSE LIFTED MOMENTS THAT YOU JUST WANT TO RELAX AND MESS AROUND.<br />DEFINITELY 5 STARS
B0046B1KHG|5.0|My daughter refused to watch any of her videos I suggested. We went back and forth over her choices--all which were refused. I remembered I had my video library account on Amazon and new she loved Despicable Me 2, I decided to look at renting the first one. The purchase price wasn't over $10 so I thought it was a better deal than renting. I offered her Despicable Me and she accepted and it is now one of her top picks! Despicable Me &#34;One&#34; Won! Thank you Amazon!
B003KVKQB4|5.0|Not an easy book to get through as it made me angry at every turn of the page but if understanding the world today is on your agenda, Shock Doctrine explains it all.
B0060D3742|5.0|It was a very good movie and the whole family enjoyed watching the movie, while we watched the movie we were all laughing
B009JZWO3I|5.0|most of the books are presents givvn to others. I  will not be able to rate them.Most of the shows I watch seem to be good.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|It's a good game just no directions as what to do our how to do it. Just winging it. Other than that I like it.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|I guess I shouldn't have expected it to be good, but I did. Pretty ridiculous 'guest' stars too. Not sure there is much to say.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again, Khaled Hosseini writes an excellent book just like A Thousand Splendid Suns & The Kiterunner. I love his books, he is truly an amazing author!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun once I got the hang of it! I definitely recommend it to my friends and everyone who has played it so far has loved it too!
B00003CXB4|5.0|It's a great moral story that is inspiring.  How an animation movie can express some profound truths are exhilarating.<br />Bravo Disney.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|I bought this for my brother for his birthday, since he is a big Harry Potter fan. He was so surprised when it showed up on his door step (which he had no clue it was coming). It delivered right on time and was a great price! =)
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Trying to keep this review short,this movie is excellent,the 1st half is toned down a little,not slow at all,but the 2nd half dosent  hold back.<br />It gets BRUTAL!<br />I spent hours checking out info on this movie,after i watched it.<br />from what I can find its  a VERY accurate portrayal of what really happened.<br />Such a rare thing in the horror genre these days.<br />The director says its not fiction it's art!<br />I'm a big fan of horror movies,and this is the best I've watched in ages.<br />I don't wana give anything away,just watch it for yourself...
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|A very fast paced interesting book.  The whole concept of interchangeable bodies fascinated me.  Highly recommended to any science fiction fan.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book.  It is one of those books you cannot put down because you are so into the characters and want to know what is going to happen to them.  The ending had me in tears.
B00B2IJJQK|5.0|This young man I did not think that I would like and to be honest when he was younger and stated his career, I didn't like him.  But now with this project, I can see his talent more and more.  Vocally he has so much potential and talent.  Despite all the allegations and scandal going on around and about him now, you have to look at this from just his work and music.  It is amazing.<br />I really can't wait to see how far he can really go and if he will be daring enough to really push the envelope
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is well written, easy to follow and hard to put down. Once you feel in control of your feelings, death throws another curve ball at you. Whether it's the gift of death itself, or life.<br /><br />This is a book I feel could be read numerous times. Thank you
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Winder is a good story by R.J. Palacio about a kid that has a face deformity and has to learn to deal with bullies school and friends. Also his sister tries very hard to defend him but when starting high school she becomes embarrassed of him. She also has to deal with friends and high school crushes.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|The movie is awesome and this version with digital copy was a steal versus buying in-store when the dvd became available.
0375703764|5.0|Probably the best recent book I've read.<br /><br />If you watched Lost and enjoyed speculating on everything between episodes, then you'll love this book. The way the various plot lines are mixed is sometimes hard to follow, but really appropriate for the &#34;happenings&#34; at that point. Intended to read it in a month or so but ended up finishing it in a week and a half.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|So much fun! I play on my kindle Fire, works great!! Wish you could get more cards for your sealed decks though...
B004TI1WME|4.0|I use this all the time when I am just sitting to figure out my finances.  I like the fact that it does have the display so that I can see what I have and have not added into the equation.<br />This is great if you are someone that wants to see the numbers or are use to using a 10 key calculator.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|well ive never got to play the game its self. This is because it takes so long loading in the process of getting there. so there it is... SLOW
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I love this story and book 3 was my favorite. I really like this author. I was about halfway through when it occurred to me that he doesn't beat you to death with what happened in books 1 and 2. It was really refreshing and made a great story even better. Its a series I will read again.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|So excited to move on to season two of the Tudors!  Love being able to stream where and when I want...on demand.  Keep getting good shows!
B004GYY714|5.0|I happened to be in a hotel with terrible reception on the regular radio, so the TuneIn app on my Kindle was brilliant.  It was good company in the morning.  Now I'm anxious to explore stations all over the world with the app.
B00B5A9FLY|2.0|I give this show 5 stars, but I give the ending 1 star. I loved this show & I watched it for 5 years. I was very very disappointed & confused on the ending. I don't know WHY King Arthur had to die. :( The ending was totally not what I expected. I feel they could have done SO much more better with the ending than that. What a huge disappointment!! I was left sad, confused, & angry at how it ended. I don't know why they canceled this show either, after only 5 seasons, when there are worse shows that are playing right now that can run for 10+ years. What a let down!
B0086HGW42|5.0|The British have it!  This album is racy and fun.  It is one that I think that a lot of Americans may miss out on.  The man is brilliant and has a wonderful way with words as well as his talent.  I would love for him to do more in the US and let the Americans see what he has to offer.<br />I you like good music and great word play then Ed is the man for you.  Just give it a listen with open ears.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|But still a great horror movie, the problem with this film is that it DOES reflect so many other horror films, In the middle of trying to submerge myself into this tale i found myself thinking  (this is so(________) fill in the blank horror movie).  If this movie had come out in the 80's it could easily stand as one of the great horror fims in a generation, Problem is it comes out 30 some years later and everything in this movie is old news. I completely agree that you can take 3-4 other Horror movies and throw them in a blender and you get \\"The Conjuring\\"...<br /><br />With that all said, Im only being so harsh on this film becouse everyone and there brother is saying its the greatest horror film of a generation... I disagree, **maybe if your 18 and havent seen any classics** this movie is being compared to the great horror films of a my generation (and thats  respectable, stuff from the past 40 years).  Now, the good !  This movie, even with its short comings is a very good movie, even though i feel it robs classics, its robs them well and is a well paced, well shot, well told horror movie. You'r introduced to important plot points and characters from the very start and the movie never slows, it maintains a very even flow through out the film, there are plenty of \\"gotcha,scary,hair,standing up, BOOO\\" scenes in this film and frankly i highly appreciate the fact that not all the great scary scenes are in the preview.. yes a few but not nearly all of them..  Im calling this one a 4 star effort and my hat goes off to the director. I dont know if the writers will be called thieves or if they will proclaim paying homage to the classics but my hat goes off to them for blending the classics well and giving us a good story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Must play sorta like subway surfers but a little better and funnier plz play a good free game is right here why not play it?
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Not an original Dr. Who fan but am delighted by these episodes. Especially liked Mark Gatiss popping up for an episode or two. Good fun and high quality from amazon!
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|This game is very fun but that is when it even loads because half the time you want too play It just fails to connect to a server gameloft please please please fix this problem I really want to play it without any interruptions
B004ODLUGM|5.0|The grandchildren loved it.  Story narration was done in quiet and gentle tones.  Children were shown how you can overcome difficulties by using your thinking skills rather than violence.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is just loads and loads of fun.  You could really get caught up in the game watching the little minions running through the obstacle course and with the different costumes.<br />If you think that the minions are adorable or if you like the movie then you will love this game.  Too cute to put down.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I just got to the quick tip page and it would not even load and it was a waste of time please fix this problem
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Another masterpiece from the master of literature. I only wish he would write faster. Cant wait for the next one
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The Orphan Masters Son was a very well written book.  It had plenty of detail that you could actually feel that you werereally there.
B00B2166BS|5.0|It works exactly as advertised. Once it makes a good connection it is a firm fit that stays connected despite minor movement of tablet. Charges so quickly that I only use this cable to charge after fully depleting my tablet. It'll be fully charged in no time.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time! This movie will bring me to tears every single time! If you love love stories, then this is the movie for you.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I was just a child in the sixties - but it's fun to watch the way the dressed and their attitudes about civil rights, women's rights, sex, etc. There are times when the dialog isn't right and they are using modern terminology. I notice that sort of thing.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|When ever judgement try to get on the internet it blocks me out so this for the kindle was a great idea
0062059963|2.0|First off, I read the book out of sheer boredom. It was a gift from a friend, which is the only reason why I had bothered in even opening the first page.<br />The plot was predictable, the love triangle--disappointing in its lack of originality--and the main character, America, was disappointing also in her lack of originality.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I gave this a 5 star rating because I thoroughly enjoyed each and every episode. I rarely give 5 stars. I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a drama that really captures your attention with characters you love and characters you love to hate!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I beleve this book is a detailed story of what we saw in the film. The filmakers took and enriched the art of the story. However, the drama, the reality, the strenght and the meanings lie within each word of the Book.<br /><br />I highly recommend reding the book to understand and watching the film to enjoy.<br /><br />The most dramatic moment: the separation from Richard Parker.
B0063IH60K|4.0|When I was in the hospital, this game helped me past the time and not worry about things to much.  I enjoyed playing
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Twists and turns that left me shocked and wanting more! You won't believe the ending to this season. I was speechless! Can't wait for Season 4!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|These were very good books. Kept me wanting more and surprised the whole time! A definate must read for everyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was fun to play with a difficulty level that was hard enough to make it interesting but easy enough to hold your interest. I am really looking forward to new room updates.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I had been thinking for a while to buy this movie for my husband.  We originally owned it on VHS when we bought it for our kids but my husband and I ended up watching it more than them... Great deal!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I expected more description of the transformation. For someone that already believes in anything this book did not strengthen my beliefs.
B00280LYIC|4.0|It was a good fast paced read. Fun and informative. Definitely going to read this with my kids when they are old enough.
B000FC130E|4.0|Good tone, engaging characters, interesting fantasy paradigm.  It didn't change my life, but it does take you away.  I suspect people who have been to London would get some references that I didn't.
B008M87GJK|4.0|BBC broadcast all the main world news events, covers every major event on time and in place, for years I have been listening BBC news over the radio and watching BBC as well.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|its though it sucked when you want they to hatch them. because it takes for ever though its awesome I love it its fun fun
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This is one of the movies we bought back in 1994/1995 in VHS version for our kids and my husband and I enjoyed it just as much... I recently bought it for my husband in DVD as a father's day present and he loved it!!!
B00003CXBK|2.0|LOVE LOVE this movie but the quality of this sellers video is very poor. looking to purchase another better quality version elsewhere.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|this app is really nice it is fun to play but it can be hard at times but other than that I really like it
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is the 10th anniversary edition, which apparently has some material the original didn't.  I don't know, I didn't read that one.  But this is a great premise, extremely well realized.  It's a great fantasy story and a crash course in comparative religion all at the same time.  Highly entertaining.
B0051ANPZQ|2.0|It is an ok book there are just to many sad parts there needs to be more happy parts but other than that it is an ok book.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|It's a pretty fun game but there isn't enough ways to earn acorns without paying real money.I don't do that. I can only go so far with these kind of games.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|I have been searching for this book for a while.  I am a software programmer and often find procrastination and writers block as an issue.  This book really put into words what I have need feeling but could not name.  A great read for someone who struggles with creativity.  This book doesn't offer some sort of solution, just a more intimate understanding of who you are as a creative person.
B005544V6A|5.0|A co-worker recommended &#34;Suits&#34; to me when I was looking for a new show to watch and I'm glad I took his advice!  This show is great!  VERY smart, well done, and I have fallen in love with Harvey Specter.  They say confidence is sexy.  That man is one of the hottest things around.  I do like Mike too.  Jessica is very elegant and love that she can hold her own against anyone.  And Donna...she's awesome!  I'm still on the fence about Rachel.  And then there is Louis.  The casting was perfect on this character. I'm yelling at him at least once every episode.  Overall, LOVE this show!
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Performs as advertised. Probably your best accessory. Even works by just plugging into your PC monitor with the PC off.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game existed to build what your imagination tells you to build like castles,STATUES,mansions and more.You also get to chat with people if you join games.their take awesome review because you can ......I'm so cool:)
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie exceeded my expectations! I thought the writers did an excellent job with keeping Clark Kent (Kal-el) as a humble, yet believable, character. And I loved Henry Cavill as Superman in MAN OF STEEL. I thought he portrayed Clark Kent very well, as did Russell Crowe as Jor-el. The CGI was tremendous, but I must admit that the fight scenes were a bit excessive and tended to run a little long; however, not enough for me to lose interest or not go back and see it again...and again. I know there are Superman purist naysayers out there, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for what it is: a very entertaining comic, come-to-life.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I loved the Harry Potter books. But this book is neither a trilling fantasy, a great detective novel nor a literary masterpiece
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|It has pretty minimal design, but it works for this game.  It is very simple to understand, but get progressively harder to match the sample as you get into the later levels.  However, with a very limited amount of levels, the game ends pretty quickly.  Was certainly worth a download for app-of-the-day, but not something I'd seek out to pay for.
B003XRELGQ|3.0|I enjoyed this novel because I really like Kurt Vonnegut's style of writing and his humor.  While I didn't find it as good as &#34;Slaughterhouse-Five&#34; or &#34;Sirens of Titan&#34;, it was definitely a solid read.
B004BSFC6Y|1.0|Ok, the idea is good, but the way it's made is just awful. These are supposed to be put on baby's feet - maybe on the baby that never ever moves? Is not like a real sock with a foot shape so it doesn't stay on for baby to shake. And the material is horrific.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great book.  Only problem is that the series never ends. Everyone you like or that seems to be noble or good is killed. I heard there were going to two more books, but haven't seen them yet.  Will it ever end?
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I love how it was written, slowly with lots of details. I enjoyed this very unique storyline, completely different from the rest and a good book to escape reality. I'll probably read it again.
B004GXKBCY|5.0|I loved State of Play.  Have seen it several times.  This was the first time I saw Spy Game.  It was pretty good too.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game glad its available now for kindlefire!!!!<br /><br />Its nice to play any where now instead of just on my home computer...would recommend this for anyone wanting to have fun playing bingo!!!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really learned from Pat. I loved all the characters and it really made me reflect on myself. Would recommend to all my friends.
B001G9F9IW|4.0|This disc has terrific quality, highly recommended for its actors and landscapes and visual work in general.<br />Great blu ray !
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had fun solving and escaping the rooms. The learning curve is just right ease n difficulty to keep u busy n pass time. Can't wait for more rooms. I recommend this app.
B0094M2ITG|3.0|The story begins slowly and it is hard to stay with it until it begins to make sense. In the end it turns out well.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|What can I say... Just put this one on, Hit shuffle, and Sit back to ENJOY. Personally I got more than expected out of this one. Let's see how they top or at least match this'a one!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Game is fun and easy to play! No money needed to have fun, just a little patience. I really like this game
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I have this app on my other devices and have been waiting with fingers crossed for it to be released for kindles, and now I can get my fix! Seriously, this game is really fun and so addicting, you'll be seeing cards in your sleep! Creative variety, humorous commentary and stellar graphics make a fantastic game!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|THIS GAME IS AN AWESOME GAME TO PLAY. IT KEEPS YOUR MIND VERY BUSY. THIS GAME IS INTENSE.. AND WILL HAVE YOU ON YOUR TOES AND HAIR STANDING UP... TRY TO ESCAPE... HAVE FUN!!!
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I am pleased with hotmail. I use it all the time and it works for me.la la la la la
B001M3LG84|3.0|This one was not as enjoyable to us as the others we have seen. He is a very accomplished violinist and a good showman. His performances show that many hours of rehearsal have gone into preparation of the programs prior to the actual performance.
0345803493|4.0|of the 3 fifty shades books, this one was my favorite. instead of focusing on just the raunchy sexual encounters, this one actually had a story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. Memorable characters. Great 90's references. (a la mix tape references!)<br /><br /> This book is told through a series of letters from our main character Charlie to an unknown reader. Charlie is a great character who has a lot of interesting interactions, and some revelations at the end are heart wrenching, but the story is just awesome!<br /><br /> This is a classic, it will be discussed for years to come. You should read it! The movie was good too!
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I'm not really sure about this one. I play it but I get bored quickly. I like the idea of it and the graphics, but there is just something missing. Not quite sure why it's not holding my interest for more than a game or two at a time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Was intense, and fun. It's a must play. Enjoyed it. Some parts were hard but it made you wanna keep playing.
B000007492|5.0|Classic songs. Great record. Music like this never goes out of fashion. Breakfast in America, Dreamer and The Long Way Home are all there along with many other classic hits.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The story line was riveting as are all of Grisham's books. Another outstanding success. Good read for all ages.The Racketeer yummy
0345803507|3.0|This one was ok. the first one seemed a bit racy, the second one had somewhat of a story to it, but the third one started to get boring.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|This was such a great deal. It's a classic, I knew it would be good, but it surpassed my expectations! This collection is a Must Read!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I wasn't sure after watching the first episode, but the show grew on me fairly quickly. It's sort of like X-Files meets Heroes in a comic book way. It's sometimes hard to take the show seriously, but I'm half way through season four now and I'm still watching.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Try it out. It's good low level strategy. Twelve more words required to finish this kind of posses me off, though.
0892818875|5.0|I have been using Young Living essential oils for eight years and have been teaching Tai Chi and Qigong for the last five years.  This book clearly ties the essential oils to the concepts of Tai Chi and Qigong energy and balance and the Chinese Five Organ and Five Element Theories.  The author describes the general properties of quite a few essential oils, which ones have similar properties, and which oils to use for certain emotional states of imbalance, including how what symptoms might indicate which side of the imbalance.  I'm about half way through the book, but I have read and re-read each page at least three times to digest all the information.
B001BR5NN0|3.0|Watched this with my 15 year old this week.  I loved John Hughes movies in the 80s, so I was a bit disappointed when this didn't live up to my high expectations. I'm sure I saw it half-a dozen times, almost thirty years ago. It just fell a bit flat, although a number of the parts with the principal were still quite funny.  Didn't remember the part where Molly Ringwald's character was harassed by Judd Nelson's character with an explicit grilling on her sexual experience.  May not be comfortable for all teens - especially if they're watching with a parent.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Nice spin on Sherlock set in current times. Wonderful cast and Holmes and Watson are a joy to watch in the series. Too bad it's not on in the states and I have to watch on AIV but I enjoyed season 1 and will be watching season 2 and 3.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|All the elements of a terrific story made for British television are here. Great story line , terrific cast ensemble, and the music background and photography are superb.
1449410243|3.0|I don't have time to write reviews - if you don't want the star ratings, don't use them. You should be happy you have the business - &#34;requiring&#34; more from your customer is a nerve!!!
0385535139|5.0|I love Grisham...very clever. Chapters are short and easy to handle in ten minutes I would buy more Grisham if I had more money
B0042RUMJG|5.0|The Sting performance is fantastic.  We have enjoyed this performance many times and it gets better each time.this is a must for any music lovers collection
B009CG9CXO|1.0|I haven't seen this film in many years, and was excited to see it in HD. Unfortunately, I couldn't watch it, because the buffering was so disruptive it was impossible to enjoy, but since  I still want to see it, I will rent the DVD someday.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A little boring for the first chapter but after that it turned into the best book I have ever read.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I enjoyed the first magic academy and #2 has many improvements. It has a better flow to the game play. It also has better quality graphics so it was easier to see the clues you were looking for. My only complaint is the fact that when playing on my touch screen kindle fire, when touch the screen to zoom or pan around the angle,  the game counts that as an error. Over all a nice little game if you enjoy this genre.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Loved it.  Anthony's quite detailed in his battle scenes.  This is a definite must read if you like \\"Name of the Wind\\".
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|When I tried to play this game, the tip screen came on and would not finish loading.  Thus the game is useless.<br />The same thing happens with the Turbo Race game.  I've tried everything I know to unlock the tip screen.  Maybe someone had the same problem and solved it?  Please let me know.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince will be missed. I know there are more still in the works, but we lost a great talent with his passing. God bless you Vince for bringing things to light that no one else would.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I absolutely love this show and cannot wait to finish watching more of them and the seasons to follow. yeah
B005F82X48|5.0|I hadn't heard of Icon For Hire before I bought their latest album. I was browsing through Amazon's selection and decided to give them a listen. I really liked what I heard! The lead female singer has such a good voice, it's strong in its ability but is never overstated, like most singers on pop radio these days. Lyrics are very important to me, I can't just listen to mindless sentiment, it has to mean something. The songs talk about overcoming addiction, whether it's addiction to attention or to destructive behavior and thinking for yourself. I know that most guys will look at this album and assume that this is &#34;chick rock&#34; but I think this album could stand up to any rock album and give it a run for its money. If you're sick of the Katy Perry and Lady Gaga clones out there, give this one a try. I like all of the songs on the album but I definitely recommend checking out, &#34;Get Well&#34;, &#34;Theater&#34;, and &#34;Make A Move&#34;. The pace of this album is on the faster side and it's a bit short but it never feels like it drags on with no purpose. If you want something a bit more ambitious than candy pop and want something of substance, check &#34;Scripted&#34; out. It's worth it.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This books is the best comic/diary type of book ever. The book is good for reading to kids or even just reading by your self. I could not stop reading this book.  AWESOME
B0002VFXFE|5.0|The most popular thermal compound is still one of the best. Yes there are better out there but they don't beat it by much.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I really loved this movie for the acting/actors who played in it and the message it sends.  Honesty is the best polcy and the truth shall set you free, just pay attention to your inner guide and you'll always find a way out of any situation.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Better than the movie, but I'm really glad the movie incorporated a LOT of things from the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Keeps you sharp. Fun for all ages. Very addictive, I've spent too much time earning bananas to upgrade things ....but having fun doing it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I really liked season 1. I thought season 2 was even  better and I am ready for season 3 to come out this fall.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|A thousand times better than the default keyboard. The predictions are so good. So helpful. Love it. If you don't have this app you need it.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|It's Harry Potter in blue ray, not a whole lot to say besides that. Great movies with great detail. The box goes nicely on my shelf with other collections and I'll probably keep watching these forever.
B0091WAPNK|4.0|Great movie. I was very impress and will watch over and over again. Happy I made this great purchase. Awesome
B00992CF6W|4.0|i got it free at 4shared . im not gonna waste money on it.<br />its very fun but get it at 4shared. it is worth it.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Very informative. Fun to read his process. Not lecturing...just great! Love it! I would recommend it to anyone interested in writing on any level.
B00005QCYD|5.0|frustrating when you put an item in the wish list and the prices goes up drastically, which makes me decide I really do not want it
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed watching the Star Trek Voyager Season 1 series as I am a fan for many years of all the Star Trek movies and TV shows. The characters are excellent and the stories are well done.
B005DN7W4G|5.0|Stellar cast, great &#34;What if&#34; storyline, excitement at every turn.  But especially touching were the decisions people made in such a situation - makes one think &#34;what would I do . . . . &#34;  I never get tired of watching it over and over again!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works with any laptop, smartphone, and tablet even if it's not your own.<br /><br />The only bad thing is that it doesn't come built-in on every TV, and Stereo.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris' life story is amazing. His wife's understanding is even more amazing. I am pretty sure Chris typifies many of the Seals past and present. A huge thank you to Chris, his family and his brothers in arms of all branches. My Chris rest in peace.
1478230096|1.0|There were multiple typos in this book, and for the amount of actual information in the book, I would have been better off buying \\"Les Miserables For Dummies\\". Wish I had paid more attention to the details of the description.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|There were lots of books for young adults when I was that age but only one or two that were special. Where oh where were you, Mr. Riggs, then with your spectacular story? (Probably not born yet, but I digress.) I looked at this book because of the picture on the cover and next the title. When I saw that it was written for young adults I went ahead and bought it anyway. I thought it would be OK for a little light reading. I was wrong and I apologize. The story is unique and I read books like this which are written for adults but I have never read anything like this. The characters are rich and entertaining. The story moves along without any unnecessary descriptions or dialogue some writers use to lengthen the number of pages. I am glad that there will be a sequel. Grown-up or older child, this is a book you won't want to put down. I didn't.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great book...a fast read and it makes you really think about life and death! Highly recommend reading this book.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|First, IGNORE ALL BAD REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />Second, IGNORE ALL BAD REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />Seriously, anyone giving this a bad review has to be the extreme geeky type that isn't pleased unless every little detail is perfect.  C'mon... You know the type I'm talking about.  They live in their grandma's basement and spend hours conversing in Klingon or arguing about what Chewie kept in each pocket of his bandolier.<br /><br />Bottom line is: this movie is well worth adding to your collection.  This is one of the best sci fi movies I've seen in a while.  I now look forward to memorizing every line, actor, stuntman, gaffer, makeup artist, and pizza delivery boy involved with the production of this masterpiece.
B0061S0A64|4.0|I really enjoy playing around on this. It's a real fun way to waste time. It gets repetitive after a while, though, and it is difficult to make anything that doesn't just sound like noise.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I will always love these books. They will make me cry, smile, and laugh. Than you for writing these books!
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|This is a fun game. But it takes up way to much memory. It's like the tablet version of gta:D
B00CATSONE|5.0|thanks for the book! short but insparational. Ive designed and built a few of my ideas but never followed up. Now i want too.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|Back to old form.<br />An intriguing yarn,if a somewhat frustrating finish.Typical le Carre ordinary characters caught in extra ordinary circumstances within a plausible scenario.
B002Q9VP48|4.0|so easy to watch and my introduction to Woody Allen who cracks a joke about ungrateful orphans and adopting handicapped kids.<br /><br />I tuned in for Scarlett Johannson and Al Swearengen and the latter is still my favorite bits of this film but this movie basically just floats along and makes for good radio when I am washing the dishes.<br /><br />DVDs should all be five dollars and provide a digital download.  As it is, I wont pay the very reasonable price of six dollars for the dvd nor twice that for the digital download.  Hopefully, the studios will get their pricing on track.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is no doubt one of the best shows in recent years. I can hardly wait for the next season to start. I love these people!!
1780721676|1.0|It came from Great Britain. It took over 2 weeks to arrive.<br />I was not aware that the Weights & Measures would be not English but British.<br />To return the Book it would cost over $4.00 so I now have a Book I can not use or read.<br />Unhappy Camper!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like it because I lose so I get to try harder.  I say never give up to what your doing.  Focus and you may win one of the vector battels.  Or the evil el mack or evil girl scout.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|This movie is amazing! I loved the blend of humor and jaw dropping gore. There are some great nods to the original but there is enough original story to make this a cut above a lot of other remakes.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|PTSD is  a common condition for veterans returning from recent wars.  Slaugherhouse-Five examines PTSD experienced by veterans of WWII - not something we think about very often.  Requires paying close attention to the details.  A good read for those interested in the experiences of those fighting in WWII and what happened to some when they returned home.
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|Still can't believe this item was only $10! I love this film and it is a perfect movie to start off your blu-ray collection!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Love the show, but wish there wasn't so much swearing...that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|My daughter is a big fan and we went out yesterday: Here is her notes. This movie is sooo absolutely funny.The minions and Gru along with the scientists and the villain are so funny I watched this movie yesterday and it is soo funny. It was one of the best movie I ever watched, and I feel I could watch it a hundred times. I wish a book would be made from the movie. Looking forward to watching it again! She was laughing all through the movie so were other kids in the theater. The only thing I don't like in a movie theater is the constant chatter of popcorns and plastic beng ruffled. I like to watch movie not eating anything. The noise was getting on my nerves! I am sure to watch in Amazon streaming once available in the quiet comfort.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this app.Yes a kid is writing this message for this review. This is my favorite app because it's fast paced and  fun.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|very faithful to the book!  it was very entertaining and the acting was well-done.  i'd watch it again any day.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Great characters, compelling story, stuck with this epic to the end.  I have just started Kafka on the Shore today.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Can't even open it on my Kindle Fire.. glad it didn't cost me any $$!! A waste of my time!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is awesome, very easy to read , I love it.  I highly recommend this item to others.  It is also good to do bible studies or meetings. You got to try it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I found this book to be quite intriguing. Some of the interviews were scary, sad, and just... crazy. I enjoyed reading it and I have to say that I'm a big scaredy cat and I was terrified that zombies were going to start jumping through my windows. I can't help but to be a huge zombie fan though. This book didn't exactly have all the terrifying things you'd expect in a zombie book and it doesn't follow along any main characters or anything, but I don't think you'd be disappointed. The interviews are in chronological order, in that they all start out by stating what happened in the beginning and as the book continues, the interviews start to get deeper into what had all happened during the war with zombies. It had more of a documentary feel to it.<br /><br />There are mentions of new technology in warfare to kill zombies and how they used dogs in the war against zombies by having them sniff out the infection in humans that hadn't reanimated yet. I would hope that if there ever was a zombie outbreak that the leaders of the countries around the world would have read this book to get a good look at how to control the situation before the world would be overrun with the undead!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who's a fan of zombies and to anyone who likes documentaries.
B001O1O71C|4.0|My wife and I purchased this book to read along-side our daughter who had it as a summer reading assignment. We all read a couple of chapters then talk about the story. Even though this book is written in a way for children to follow easily, it was good that we read it this way. I knew this book had the potential to be depressing; however, I did not see the story playing out as it did. It was a very interesting story. I enjoyed that it was from the point of view of a child. It brought some innocence to a heart-breaking story.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|chuck norris saved the movie with his sheer awesome ness<br />it just needed more chuck norris all around. and JCVD was silly
B003B02O14|3.0|Too many things fell into place to easily.  I guessed how the ending would come out within the first few chapters.  Far from Grisham's best.<br /><br />Steve B.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has different obsticals  for you to play and it is very good because you can get bananas and other cool things .
B003HV0TN2|5.0|Just brilliant. The writing is entrancing, captivating. The story is new and different. I have read it multiple times and it doesn't lose it's magic.
B00CDY6HW6|2.0|The game is nice. Good UI, nice sounds, permissions wise is perfect... But every time that I select the Next button (after I am done with a level) or hit the Restart button, the app automatically closes itself. Am I the single person with this problem? Everything else is just fine!
B001EYK54W|2.0|they had a scene where they played chess for 10 min!<br />remake was much better, go watch the remake, meow
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I WIPED IT OFF MY KINDLE OUT OF SHEER BOREDOM AFTER THE 1ST 100 PAGES. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.<br /><br />STEVE B.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Hands down, my absolute favorite book written to date 10 Starts). I have read this book more than 5 times and I still cannot get sick of it! All of the characters are well developed and the story line is relatively original. And most importantly to me, this is a whole story, from beginning to end. I don't feel like I was left with any unanswered questions (this happens so often with writers). I FELT what the characters FELT! The only thing that I wish is that there could have been a few more pages at the end. The ride home from the airport! Oh, to be a fly on the wall in that car!!!!!!!  :)<br /><br />Thank you Jamie McGuire! Thank you so very much!<br /><br />On a side note, unfortunately, I would not bother buying the sequel to this novel (Walking Disaster). It is essentially the same book you will read here and once the story evolves into something you haven't already read, the book is over and leaves so many unanswered questions. Sorry Jamie- it was a waste of your time to have written that novel.<br />If book one wasn't so incredible, I would not read anymore of your books on the sole basis that I feel like you stole my money with book two! I felt very let down!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just downloaded this free game app,  I am having so much fun with it I lost time Started playing this in the early morning and it's already 1:00 in the afternoon!  I was having so much fun I couldn't' put the game down. I Would definitely recommend this game to anyone at any age!
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|Wow! This is an amazingly informative and readable guide. If you love, like, or are just curious about the movie Scarface, this guide is for you. It provides a thorough, detailed, and extremely well-researched analysis of the movie, complete with a comparison of the original 1932 version and its 1983 remake. I loved this line that Mr. Stevenson writes in his comparison, \\"There are more bullets in the 1932 movie and more blood in 1983.\\"<br /><br />He follows up this point with an insightful analysis of the use of violence in movies, and the differences in suggested violence (think the shower scene in Psycho) and violence shown on the screen. Suggested violence, writes Mr. Stevenson, \\"is still shocking and disturbing.\\"<br /><br />This guide doesn't leave a single aspect of the movie untouched: themes, music, critical reception,  selection of actors, historical background, cinematic techniques and parallels between Scarface, Psycho, Pulp Fiction and even Macbeth, it's all here. Movie buffs are sure to love this ultimate guide.
B00BZAZVV2|3.0|This movie was originally released when I was around 12 years old, my parents took me to see it, back then I didn't really understand much of the movie, to this day, I kind of get the intended message, but in spite of a great cast of young actors it just sort of went about it's still semi-convoluted message of personal freedoms and generational conflict in a round about way.<br /><br />Some of the music was awesome, the music really tied the scenes together, but seeing a young Jack Nicholson and Dennis Hopper was a rush.  Again, it's okay, maybe serious baby boomers and Vietnam era guys will have a different read than I do.<br /><br />The music was great and some of the cinematography was good.  Honestly, the soundtrack was the best part for me, maybe I'm still that 12 year old kid looking at that era from the outside.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is insane and for the money it's a great deal. Th  graphics, the selection of weapons,upgrades, the scenery, and the sound makes you feel like in a movie. highly recommended this game and the update even made it better
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|works well for MOST of my videos.  I love the way it scans media so you do not need to go thru gallery app
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I have given this FB app a generous trial. I even uninstalled and reinstalled star thinking this might be the best one.  Turns out, it really sucks. Pages don't load, features are missing, and it's difficult to view pics and change them. Plus it always asks if the user wants mobile version or regular version. Pick one and perfect it please. Both versions are inadequate and lame. Why can't someone create a beautiful, seamless, easy to use FB app?
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I wanted to show my kids how much fun movies could really be, when they actually had to work to make them. The stuff now is not comprable to the older movies in quality and detail. My kids and I had so much fun watching the movies.
B0047SKR54|4.0|It's a kind of long, surrealistic tale of a time and place not well understood.  The acting was brilliant, Martin Sheen was amazing, The way this movie turns up river is truly incredible.<br /><br />This is one long movie, the cinematography is breath taking, there were so many great young actors whom I've seen grow since I saw this movie in college.  In fact this is the movie that convinced me that I was going into the Navy (don't ask).The narrative was really amazing, all in all, not a bad experience.<br /><br />It was worth seeing again and for first time viewers there is some really beautiful cinematography.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved Ms. Collins writing.  Kept you very interested and you couldn't easily figure out what would happen next.  Good read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Brainteaser. Amazingly hard and an enjoyment to do on a ling roadtrip. I will recommend to anyone. My favorite levles are the difficult ones.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|I really love this game. It's even better than Jetpack Joyride. It's a lot more interactive too. VERY ADDICTING. Play it. Buy it. Love it.
B00DU73T08|3.0|Bought to watch with my daughter.  She liked it.  It could have been shorter (probably by 30 minutes) and it would have been improved.  Would I watch it again? No.  Did I make it through it? Yes.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I like it. Gives clues so you can move forward.  Or let's you skip puzzles that you cannot figure out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The twists and turns in this book made this read very interesting and hard to put down.  The ending didn't have the same suspense as the rest of the book.
B00C1CO0XS|4.0|Geez.  Didn't know that George Benson could sound like Nat King Cole.  If he was doing it on purpose, he was doing a pretty good job.  Otherwise, his natural singing voice really did complement ole Nat's.<br /><br />Oscar Peterson also sounded like Nat when the former would sing.  If I remember correctly, I read somewhere that that was one of the primary reasons why Peterson came out with only two albums wherein he did vocals.  He realized that he sounded too much like Cole, who was a good friend of his, and thus stopped doing vocals, in deference to the great crooner.<br /><br />It would have been fantastic to listen to Cole, Peterson, and Benson singing together in one album.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this book! I could and have read it over and over. Very good story line! Simply put....this book is amazing!!!!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I have been using the Withings pulse now for around 3 weeks.  Since the first day that I had charged it and put in on my belt, I noticed how little I walked around on a daily basis.  The pulse has sort of been my workout buddy that keeps on pushing me to go out and do things.  I usually now take an hour at lunch and briskly walk.  The other day I reached a daily step count of over 20,000 steps!  My goal now is always to be over 70k steps for the week!<br /><br />As for sleeping this device is giving the a look into my sleep patterns and that I need to sleep more, the graph really helps me see how much sleep and quality of sleep I am receiving.  Way to go Withings.<br /><br />Another aspect of the pulse, dealing with its name, is the ability to take your pulse anytime you want to, and something that I found interesting is that you can you use the wristband as a way to take your pulse and not only using the tip of your finger.<br /><br />The simplicity of Pulse in all aspects is great.  Just charge it up, stick it on your clothes, or in your pocket and go about your day!<br /><br />I use other Withings products as I have one of their scales and blood pressure cuff.<br />Looking forward to other withings products or enhancements in the future.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|This is a great movie that is beautiful to watch and really makes you think about what is around the next corner
B001O1O71C|4.0|From the boys eyes it was easier to enjoy . They put a human side to an inhuman situation. I enjoyed this book very much.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is a wonderful book to read as a book club selection. My book club members all loved it. We learned so much about the British Isles during the war.
0062082353|5.0|I loved this book and highly recommend it for others.  It is a great first person account of what is like to be in an advanced military unit, and the impact it has on military personnel.  Unlike other SEAL books I have read it does not spend half the book describing BUDS, and it gives a heart wrenching account about the stress being in the military can cause on love ones.  The author, Chris Kyle, is an inspiration and an American hero.  I especially recommend this book to anyone who wishes to join the military.
0553801473|1.0|I have no complaints about the contents of the book, I love the series, I love the author. My complaint lies with the copy, the book I received in the mail is missing 30 pages of the book (right in a particularly interesting part), instead it repeated 30 pages of material I had already read. Hopefully this is just a fluke and isn't consistent with all copies, but be warned.
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|Blood, Sex,Power,Glory. It doesn't get bigger than this.  Most underrated Show of All Time.  One of the greatest season finale ever, &#34;Kill Them All.
B00992CF6W|5.0|omg this is the most awesome game that their is I love it great game!!! I love the mobs my favroit is creeper
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down from beginning to end. Gillian Flynn is a talented author and I hope she continues writing novels with a&#34;twist&#34;. I just read another book by her, Dark Spaces&#34;. It is another winner!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed the second book in the trilolgy. I'm currently reading it for the third consecutive time. I can't get enough of Christian and Anastasia.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|its a pretty fun space shoot em up. got it for free but i probably would have bought it anyways.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I like the flow from the fourth book to the fifth book. Let us hope that it doesn't take Martin long to finish the 6th book. Our you may find me just as mad as mad king aerys!
B005S9ELVC|3.0|This should have been a great movie! Josh Brolin was perfect as the honest cop wanting to stymie the Mafi King.A bit naive...Ryan Gosling was at his usual best as the suave,well dressed , not naive policeman! I t  wasn't believable that Sean Penn did'nt seem to have an inkling that his woman was carrying on with the cop....isn't that why thugs are all around with their guns....keeping an eye on everybody?? Exactly  when does he find out and  why the mistaken idenity! Brolin's wife was a great character!<br />All in all, for such a supposedly big Mafia East coast operation, you weren't shown much of what went on.Just the cops talking about it.The movie sort of left you up in the air...wondering if there should be a sequel!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My friend got me interested in the show at the end of season three, so I had to go back and watch season one, two, and three to really appreciate the show. Now I am anxiously waiting for the next season....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this game is AWESOME! My favorite part is what he does when you touch him before you start your run.

B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Star Wars pinball has kept me entertained for hours.  It is worth the $1.99 for The Empire Strikes Back table.  While it doesn't have the nostalgia feel of a classic machine, it puts pinball into the tablet age.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What a fabulous way to tell a story!  Mister Brooks puts a fresh spin on the Zombie mythology, with a nuanced and clear eye for the cultural and human factors around the globe.

0307476464|5.0|The \\"1Q84\\" trilogy is, without doubt, an impressive book. In many ways, the trilogy almost has to be read in this way as the three component books make little sense on their own. The first book in the series in particular is almost completely baffling if taken in isolation. It does, though, demand a degree of dedication, and if the prospect of a 1300 page novel in which not a huge amount happens in terms of plot and in which there is a significant level of repetition leaves you cold, then this might not be the best entry point into the wonderful world of Haruki Murakami. As often with Murakami though, it's possible to read this book at a number of levels. On the surface it's a love story set in a slightly fantastical setting with a little bit of crime thrown in. At a deeper level, he explores the this lines between imagination and reality, life and death and what you might call yin and yang. It's a novel where balance and vacuums play a big part. It seems counter-intuitive to call a book of this magnitude \\"delicate\\", but that's just how the story appears.<br /><br />The first two books consist of alternating chapters on the lives of two people, fitness instructor Aomame and maths teacher and struggling novelist Tengo, who we subsequently learn have more of a connection than we at first think. Incidentally, apparently Aomame translates as \\"green beans\\" in Japanese which is one of the few areas in which the English translation of this story misses out on a beautiful quality of the original. In fact, it's worth noting that the third book has a different translator to the first two, but you would never notice. The third book introduces the perspective of another character, the shifty Ushikawa, and if I have one criticism of the book it is that this third perspective does rather slow down the already stately pace of the book as for much of the first half he merely repeats knowledge that we already know about the back stories of Aomame and Tengo.<br /><br />\\"1Q84\\" might also creep into the genre of dystopian fiction but in a light way. The book starts of in 1984 but while Aomame doesn't initially notice any changes, an event soon takes her into an alternate reality, hence \\"1Q84\\" where the only clear give away is that there are two moons in the sky rather than the traditional mono-lunar normality.<br /><br />Aomame and Tengo are both involved in a secret sideline, and both are likely to land them in a whole heap of trouble. Although there are hints that the two stories go together, it's not really until about half way through the second book that the knowledge of each other becomes clear to the reader. In fact, it is this point on the book, around half way through, that the book moves from being intriguing to being downright clever and, at one level, quite deep.<br /><br />While I haven't read a huge amount of Japanese fiction, I think of Murakami as being quintessentially Japanese. The Western reader is always aware of that slight cultural disconnect and sense of Eastern mysticalness. What makes this book unusual therefore is the heavy allusions to a raft of Western literature. The title itself of course brings to mind Orwell, but there are explicit and implicit references to works ranging from Alice in Wonderland to Chekhov via Shakespeare.<br /><br />Although if you are new to Murakami, I might suggest starting at some of his earlier works, although long, this is always accessible. One note of caution though would be that, as fans of Murakami know, he is not shy of the odd sex scene and here there is a slightly uncomfortable element of pedophilia that might cause offence to some. It's not as entirely clear cut as all that but to reveal why would involve an element of spoiler revelation, but there are moments when it is slightly uncomfortable shall we say?<br /><br />It is without doubt a superbly clever and well constructed book and, as always with Murakami, there is a certain charm and beauty to the story. Aomame, in particular,is hard not to like for all her quirks and dubious actions. If you've never read Murakami, you should, and you should probably start with something like \\"Norwegian Wood\\". If you are already a convert though, this is a joy and will have you checking the night sky just to be sure.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|No matter what kind of day you are having you can always put in The Bind Bang Theory and it is all better!! I can watch this show over and over again and still laugh hysterical!!! i hope this show never goes off the air i would be so lost with out it!!!

B008XG1X18|5.0|The app works great on my Kindle Fire.  It is easy to navigate and easy to use.  Thanks a bunch, Amazon!
0486650677|5.0|This is probably my favorite book of all time. It is a very rich treatise on analytical mechanics. It does a good job of explaining the philosophy and motivations of the physics, and while the mathematics is difficult, the book assumes the reader already knows it instead of wasting their time. The proofs are well-written and clear. The exercises can be a bit removed form the text, but overall this is simply the best way to learn analytical mechanics.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|despicable me minion rush is very fun and it is just like<br />temple run and subway suffers and that's a good thing<br />because they are all fun.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|It is laugh out loud comedy and every person needs to have their own personal sheldon around just to make them laugh every day!!! Penny is great too!!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|As for Amazon, the instant video played without any issues.<br />The film it self has many components that make a great film : action, protagonist, antagonist, etc.
B00DU73T08|3.0|This movie was a lot better than the twilight series a good trade off with the wife and what makes her happy makes me happy
B005JTAP4S|4.0|Find this review and more at Lusty Penguin Reviews!<br /><br />Peter: A Darkened Fairytale is a thrilling and entertaining teen fantasy novel by William O'Brien.<br /><br />Peter finds an intriguing-looking box in the upstairs of an antique shop. On his tenth birthday, Peter returns to the antique shop and discovers he was destined to find the box and begin an incredible journey. With a special key and a clock, Peter is transported to a new dimension and begins his journey. O'Brien's vivid and colorful descriptions of the various locations Peter visits are so beautifully detailed that you feel like you are right there with him. Peter is indeed a brave young man as he meets all kinds of new beings and creatures--elves, fairies, dragons, and ghosts--just to name a few. Using his wits, Peter solves puzzles along the way, which I really enjoyed. Pulse-pounding action, along with stunning plot twists, keeps the reader fully engaged in Peter's journey to fight evil and make it back home.<br /><br />With a unique plot and endearing characters, Peter: A Darkened Fairytale is a page-turning story perfect for teens and adults alike.<br /><br />I received an eBook copy from the author for the purpose of an honest review. I was not compensated for this review, and all conclusions are my own responsibility.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved this book and am looking forward to the other books in the series.  Was a fast read and the character creation is amazing.  Great story line, easy to follow.
B003V2HWP0|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie...the acting was superb and it is easy to get swept into the story and caught up in the love affair.
B000FC12C8|4.0|Unfortunately, a lot of the original text is drawn from events that are not all that current.  Nevertheless, much of the discussion contains lessons that are timeless so I find this book valuable.  I particularly like the clear distinction the author makes between investing and speculation.  Worthwhile read.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This is the best thing they ever created I have been able to share my mix tape on soundcloud or any other site I have sent  My music to my sd card so then I can enjoy my mixes at any time
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Brought me back to some of the best experiences in my young life. Highly recommend this book
B00CWY76CC|4.0|my 6 year old helps me with this. GREAT FUN<br />keeps us guessing. and is wonder problem solving! we love it
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Your toddler will be in complete amazement. The look, feel and quality are unsurpassed. What a fabulous toy to buy and to give. As real as it gets with the dump bed and even the tires feel real. In every sense of the word, you get what you pay for and quality in toys don't get better than these. Great features.<br />NOTE: This is a BIG toy, much bigger than we expected, which give it even more appeal.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I love everything i have read from Phillippa Gregory! She tells a captavating story, from women's perspective.  I am always on the edge of my seat in her books and sorry to see them end. She always leaves you wanting more and eager for the next book to surface. i recommend you read them all - from constant princess, the Boleyn series and all of the Cousin's War series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Didn't disappoint at all...I've read the trilogy twice, so much better than the movie alone. So complex and haunting but tears of joy too
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved this movie. It is great for parents and kids. Very funny with a good message at the end.
B0040I09RM|5.0|All good episodes!  This is my favorite season!!  The time goes by so quickly when i am watching it!  Love
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I like every song on this album. I bought this to play on my android and laptop. I wish i would have ordered the CD also to play in my car.
0670026557|2.0|I was more inspired by a 5 minute interview that the author did than by reading the book. He should have written a 4-page articles. Just explain the idea. Give a few short examples how the reader can apply this in his life. Done. The book as it is is filled with stories, and it takes 6 hours to read through. So you read for 10 minutes about some randomly selected story, just to get to the point which could be explained in 30 seconds. I don't know what it is with writers these days. It started with Malcolm Gladwell: You have a vague theory. You collect random stories that support your theory. And then you dump it all on the reader. It's some weird 21st century fashion thing in the writer's world, where \\"non fiction\\" becomes bloated with stories. I find it annoying. Why don't you think your theory through, put it down in a short book or article, and then, if somebody wants to learn more, or if they don't believe you, THEN you can unpack a couple of stories to back up your theory. The author should be the one who does the research and sifts through stories to find the grains of truth. He should find them, and he should present them to the reader in an easy to understand, easy to apply form. Not drag him along through his research. Besides: For every story that Grant picked to prove a point, one could easily find another story to disprove it. Stories don't prove anything. They are mere entertainment. And I didn't buy this book to be entertained. I wanted to learn more about giving. And I am disappointed to realize that I learn about giving much faster by reading what people write ABOUT this book - rather than reading the book itself.<br /><br />P.S. Maybe the issue is that I already AM convinced about giving, and didn't buy the book to be convinced that, yes, giving leads to success and not to being a doormat. But that's who the book seems to be written for: For people who still need to be sold on the WHY of giving. Which is really weird, because only people who think (or at least suspect) that giving might be the key will ever buy it.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This game is adventurous and fun..it keeps you guessing and using your brain the whole way through I'm glad I caught it the day it was free
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book isn't my favorite of the three books, but still a great book and very much worth reading. Author Khaled Hosseini is a master storyteller, and it amazes me how real his characters become to me. I can't think of any other author that can match his talent.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very good book. Surprises all the way through and the whole concept flows so smoothly. You become attached  to the characters and feel what they feel. Great read.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I Really like her voice and all songs on this album. I bought the skyfall soundtrack a while back but didnt know her name. I enjoy listening to her anytime of the day.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Yeah. I got this game because it was free and recommended by a friend. I've played it now 3 hours straight. It makes me giggle
B002N44XSG|5.0|I wish I could read it again and again you have to read it I finished it in one day
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Although the book starts a little slow, it really lures the reader in to want to understand the characters, the circumstances, the plot.  By half way, it becomes a major page turner!!  Loved it!
B000HF6XV8|5.0|My girls (7 and 10) loved it and so did I!  Closely followed the classic story and was a nice way to spend the afternoon.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is very fun to play but it takes forever to load in the beginning and lags alot but it is really fun
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I Love the books but if you don't like a good teen romance with lots of cliff hangers, and continuations to the next book and the next book oh well you should still read it.
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|The action and acting are very good. In this version Merlin is very frustrating. He's always a day late and a dollar short. But still, the character is likeable.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Absolutely love this project. I'd recommend this young lady's work to anyone who will listen. In fact, I have asked three people to get the project.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I recommend purchasing this app. It was a fun and enjoyable game. Many levels and different types of mini games are included.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Watching this show for the second time around, gritty, cool cinematography and awesome actors. FX does good work, amazon brings it home
B00000K3CR|5.0|This movie is a genuine classic. Hats off to Penny Marshall for a great concept and a great job. A definite feel-good movie!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I think that this movie is heart-warming.  Losing love and then finding it again.  Disney couldn't be more spot on to what I, as a Disney Channel watcher, look for in a Disney Movie.  It doesn't get more original than that.  You can really feel Mac and Brady's struggle to get home, but finding where they belong on the way.  This movie is chock-full of a great cast, fun songs, and funny dances moves.  This film will make you never want to leave summer behind.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app was very cute and addictive, I play whenever I get the chance! The boss levels in the game were unexpected and new. I really do like this game.
B00844PED2|5.0|After some 30yrs i came back to Herriot,, just lovely.  Funny, sad, innocent, humble and such a wonderful observation of a way of life that we can only read about now, loved it
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|It is too confusing.  There are no instructions to tell where to find the puzzle pieces.  I play on my kindle fire & I'm just totally confused.  I can get thru a couple screens & then get totally stumped.  May go back & try it again, but not sure.
B000W7JWUA|3.0|This is a fun family game for pre-teen through adult. It takes a lot of time to play and there is a lot of trading going on in the game.  The game cost to much for what is in the box. You are paying for the idea not the parts. They should pack the extension kits with this game at this cost and then it would be worth it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie. Didn't think it'd be this funny. I watched it twice in theater and dozens of times at home.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is super fun<br />I am older than 10 and not a big my little pony fan but the game is super fun
0440237688|5.0|This was a reread for me.  It was wonderful to experience this book for the second time. My rereading of it did not, in anyway, affect the emotions that come along with reading this book. I still found myself shocked, and in tears through certain passages. Never has a book so rightfully earned its 5 stars on Goodreads.<br /><br />The Giver is set in a Utopian world. Different from the distopian novels that are so popular in the YA world today, . The main character Jonas is intelligent and curious. In this world children receive their job assignments when they are 12 years old. When Jonas is selected as the communities new Receiver, he is unsure what to expect.<br />This story is set in an exquisitely well crafted society. Lowry leaves no stone unturned when describing the way food, family, and jobs are handled in her world. Lowry uses her \\"perfect\\" world to explain how control and safety can also mean sacrifices. Choices are nonexistent, neither are feelings. Jonas, the main character, takes us on a fascinating journey to find out what this means for humanity. How important are feelings like anger and love? Are they more important than safety, and comfort?<br /><br />The Giver is a must read for everyone. It stands strong as one of my favorite books of all time, and for good reasons. It forces the reader to question the world around them. Thought provoking does not even begin to describe it.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|This installment of the series just doesn't offer anything good. There is a ton of stuff to do but everything is poorly made and the visual quality is poor as well. I would recommend the other games over this one, but I'm looking forward to the next gang star game.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I just received a new phone & it has this game on it.  I don't play the game but my 5 year old grandson loves it.  Keeps him occupied when I can't.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|My daughter was looking at this book to see if she wanted to read it or not and accidentally purchased it. Would like to have my money back but something tells me it would be more of a hassle than it's worth
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game make more of them I love  this app it's great for your kids so down load this amazing app you will love it is a good app for
159463176X|4.0|&#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; lacks the gut-wrenching immediacy of &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;, but delivers a synpathetic portrait of strangers in a strange land - that land being the US, and none too flattering a portrait.
B005R32L66|4.0|I love being able to talk & see my sister who lives in another state.  I don't know if it is Comcast or Skype but a lot of time we freeze up or the picture & voice break up.  Still, it's worth the problems to be able to see & talk to her at the same time.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I enjoyed the big buttons and the calculator worked as promised and no glitches In the program. I would recommend it.
B005FPT51K|5.0|Love the product , i use it at all times. The only thing i would say its missing its the android friendly app
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really love this game. I bought it especially for my partner as he normally doesn't like to play games. But this game he just can't stop playing.
B008602KQI|4.0|I'm really not much of a sci-fi fan, but I enjoyed this one. The production was well done.  Two words.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The movie was action packed. The characters worked well together in the story. Easy to watch and simple to pass time.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I noticed some had problems with this app on kindle fire HD. Others said it worked great. I just wanted to transfer a pdf file to docs folder. Initially it appeared to work OK. I moved it and it showed up in docs folder. When I looked in docs folder next day it was gone. Went back to web downloads and had a hard time viewing it in web downloads . Stated it did not download properly although it was fine previous day. When I touched &quot;try again&quot; was finally able to view pdf file in downloads. Tried several times to move or copy to docs folder again to no avail. I also noticed several folders had some wierd files in them when using this app. It obviously wasn't working properly on my kindle fire HD. I had apprehensions about continuing to use it as I didn't want to lose any files already stored on the kindle. I deleted it without any problems so far. Had high hopes, it just didn't work for me.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Can get only to a loading screen. Will not go past this screen. Gave it overnight to load on two separate occasions. Deleted from kindle and repurchased, reinstalled. Still game will not \\"load\\" on device.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This product cleaned up cache, memory and closed running programs in seconds. It also allows you to see ALL programs installed and lets you uninstall programs you no longer need with just a click.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|My kids convinced me to let them download this app and we were very disappointed. It doesn't offer anything unless you choose to pay for additional options. I will be removing this app.
B00C8985DU|5.0|I recently had the opportunity to see Sir Paul McCartney for the first time in concert on his Out There tour. It was the most spectacular concert I've see. Purchasing the Wings Over America box set was a much worthwhile addition to my collection. Any Beatle fan or Paul McCartney fan should have this in their collection.
B008HK3S9K|5.0|I have enjoyed using this product. It does what it advertises, and it is very pretty as well. I recommend this to anyone who wants a good cover for their Kindle Fire.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars = Awesome<br />George Lucas's butchering of the original trilogy = Unforgivable<br /><br />This package? Good value, crappy special effect additions look even worse in HD, but the package has lots of bang for your buck. Looks and sounds amazing on Blu-Ray with a Blu-Ray surround sound system. Absolutely a must-have in your Star Wars collection....especially when you need the prequels for some fire kindling.<br /><br />Great purchase, but I enjoy my old 1997 VHS collection more.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is awesome just the levels you don't buy well it's a bit short I beat them  all in like 2 hours.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very exciting. A little slow to start but then takes off. A real page turner! Could not put it down. While brutal, there are many conflicting emotions that define the characters. Sometimes the thought of physical death is far easier than the emotional turmoil that will last forever.
B0061S0A64|4.0|great app, you can change up the sounds , make it faster/slower customize it ,  I use it<br />to sleep by
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome with the updates but it would be better if it updated faster on the kindle fire hd7 and it would be much better with endermen and the nether
B00280LYIC|5.0|My 10 year old daughter said: his book is very exciting because Percy Jackson is always being chased by evil people. She liked it and thought it was a little scary and sad.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Maggie Smith shines, but all four actors do as well.  Makes getting old not so scary.  Great cast and story
B00866JL96|4.0|This movie really dug into the lives of both characters and how alone each felt.  You couldn't help but root for a happy ending for them both.  Was very thankful that they got it in the end.  Another feel good, curl up under a blanket movie.  Zac Efron did a wonderful job of bringing you right into his emotions.  Her picture helped him survive 3 tours in Iraq and he viewed it as his good luck charm.  He had the weight of the world on his shoulders and just felt lost till he decided to find her.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is simply one of the best. It is so  simple but at the same time challenges you a lot. You must have it!
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I have waited so long to see this movie in HD.<br />I was a bit worried that it would look cheesy but the restoration looks great and the movie holds up excellently.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Its bumping yo<br /> I mean really bumpping , It so bumping that I had to force myelf to right this review for it
B000268QB2|5.0|The best album of history, my favorite song: Bedshaped, Everybodys Changing Somewhere only we know and this is the ast time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't stop playing! It's an addictive game. It's hard at first, but but once you see what you're up against, doable. I had some trouble at first getting it loaded on my Kindle, but they seem to have fixed that. Love the minions!
0786955554|4.0|I would highly recommend this item to any first time users.<br />There is a lot of diversity when using this set allowing you to use your imagination to create dungeons.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I am a big fan of superheroe movies and I really enjoyed this movie. I can not wait for the next installment of the Avengers.
B000UFAURI|5.0|The best of foo fighters, recomended for all. Favorite song: The Pretender , Let it Die and Long road To Ruin
B005D4YP0Y|5.0|My 2nd pair, size 13's.  Old pair eventually started falling apart.  Years of use... especially in and out of Water eventually did them in.  perfect for camping.  We do annual camping on fresh water islands in Northeast.  Jump in lake... walk right out on rough / slippery rocks no problem.  No worries about Zebra mussel cuts, etc.  Shoes dry out fine... heavy duty toe protects against injuries from roots / rocks on trails... especially at night.  I'll get another pair when these wear out.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Very interesting.  I love works that delve into the personality of a subject and Nancy Gibbs did that very well.  It was interesting to see how these presidents, past and current, interacted.  Something the public would not know.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|This was a terrible book and a waste of both time and money. How did it get published in the first place?
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I like all the song, but the best : I should Have Know, These Days, Walk, Brige Burning and A metter of time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A surprising end to the awesome trilogy. I can't wait for the movie to come out to see this one.
1451695195|3.0|I expected a more description of life after death but was disappointed to find it was more cerebral than descriptive.  Still am not sure what he experienced.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Funny movie. Adult content, but very real scenarios. Fun to watch, especially if you've passed age 40.  We laughed out loud.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You can't last a day without playing this awesome game. This game is so good that I play it everyday.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|Man this is a really good CD. I find that I get more work done with it on in the background. It will put you in a great mood for the rest of the day.. This CD is therapy..
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love everything about this show from the acting to the music to the set. It is truly a masterpiece!!
B00ADS98FC|4.0|. . . you will like this movie.<br /><br />In many ways the script is very predictable.  There is not a lot of substance to it.  BUT it is fun.  The musical performances are well done and Anna Kendrick has an outstanding voice.  There are parts that just make me laugh out loud.  With Rebel Wilson in it, I bet the out-take reals are hysterical!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Its not that I hate it, I am trying to get Candy Crush, the game, not the guide.<br />cant seem to get it.
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|Saw it at the theatre and considered it worthy enough for purchase!  Great story based upon the original with some nice twists and equally evil characters.
B00DJXSKWU|5.0|This is an awesome game but at the beginning it's a bit confusing. I highly recommend this game . Worth the dollar.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Nothing negative to say. It was a great show that should have gone on for many years. To bad it did not. To see it in Bluray was a treat.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Overall a very good movie and I enjoyed it a lot. I thought the acting was very well done. I can't wait for the sequel.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It is exceedingly easy go get lost in this game for hours when you are trying to kill time. It is fun, addicting, and hard as nails.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Although u need tokens to play this game it is so much more fun with the interactions with other love players. And every 40 minutes you get a free scratch off card that gives thou free tokens!! Much better playing with friends than the plain uno game!!!!
B0019NG73G|5.0|History is something we should remember especially when it tells us what we have done wrong so not to repeat it. This story is well told and sticks to the book &#34;killer angels&#34; to the letter. There are plenty of &#34;what ifs&#34; in this historical battle. Now you get to see more of it. It is very long but worth it. The extra footage helps to tell the story. Well done.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This is a must watch for fans of sci-fi, as it is truly visionary film conceptually and stunning in its cinematography. Ordinary film-goers should also consider seeing this in theaters for the thrilling action and fascinating mind-games Oblivion offers to the audience. A moving tale of the transcendence of love and a provocative examination of conscience, home, memory and what it means to be truly human.<br /><br />For a full review, search for my blog \\"Pulling On The Push Door\\", and look for the \\"Oblivion\\" review.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love how they are taking the DC universe a little darker.  This show takes the green arrow mythos along with some well known DC villains like deadshot.  Side characters are fun and interesting and the flashbacks to the island are a great ride.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow free is a addictive puzzle game. I have spent 20min. on it playing nonstop. Although the first 60 levels are fairly easy, they get very difficult. There are probably more than 200 levels on the app, all of them free. If you are looking for a mind puzzler, this amazing app is what I would reccomend.
0525478817|5.0|Dear John Green,<br /><br />You. Are. Killing. Me.  I read The Fault in Our stars yesterday in less than 24 hours.  Although I think this book deserves much more reflection than a mere matter of hours, I couldn't help myself.  I literally could not put the book down.  It's a good thing it was a Saturday and my husband was here; otherwise, my children would have had to fend for themselves due to a neglectful mother.<br /><br />In the last two weeks, I've read Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars.  The latter is BY FAR my favorite.  I also shed more tears reading it than I have cumulatively for the last year.  You just had to do that to us, didn't you John Green?  Now, I have read many reviews that critique you for using a \\"formula\\" in your writing.  And yes, it is true that I see many resemblances between these three books (more so in Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska).  But with that, I have also encountered writing that is so profound, thought-provoking and downright funny that it's hard to criticize.  I actually laughed out loud several times while reading this.  I mean really, only you could make a one-legged cancer victim irresistibly hot.  And clever.  And naively romantic.  And brilliant.  Oh man...<br /><br />But truly, the manner in which you delicately yet honestly handled the oh-so-scary matter of cancer was beyond commendable.  And it's not just people who have had cancer or known someone with cancer or studied cancer that can appreciate this book.  Anyone who has experienced pain, grief, love or loss will glean wisdom from this story.<br /><br />I also want to thank you for making both of the main characters incredibly likeable.  No Margos or Alaskas here.  Augustus and Hazel were both...how do I put this?  Freaking awesome!!  Not without flaws, but still kind, original, funny (albeit a little strange) people.  They became real to me, which I think is the intent of good writing.<br /><br />So thank you John Green.  Even though youmade me sob like a child, I don't think I can adequately express how wonderfully fantastic this book is.  You are something else.<br /><br />Until next time,<br /><br />Brittney

B0090SI4LU|2.0|I haven't read the book and I don't think I want to.  I saw this movie in theaters, dozed off a few times.  The movie is pretty boring.  There's action, but it wasn't enough to keep my attention.  In fact, this may just put you to sleep, for there's so much talking throughout it.  The acting wasn't very good, either.  My advice is to see something more entertaining and avoid wasting time and money on this.

B003YL4KS0|5.0|If you have curly hair - this is for you.  I am in my 60's and have lived most of my life fighting my curly hair, suffering bad haircuts, and daily frizz.  The author lays out a plan of action for celebrating the beautiful curls we were born with.  I have been applying her suggestions and the results are awesome.  Less time, less money spent on my hair and way better results.  My curly locks are glorious and the compliments just keep coming!
