B0052RDHTM|2.0|I'm having a hard time getting into this book.  It jumps around areas and characters quite a bit in the beginning.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It's funny, cute, a great storyline, very colorful, fantastic animation, and just a joy to watch. I think you will enjoy this move.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This is a classic book, not just for children. The characterizations were very detailed and believable especially the sociopathic Long John Silver.  Great story which has stood the test of time.
B0091QS88K|5.0|both my 2 1/2 and 4 year old love this game. need to buy full game soon for them too.
B0012C7ET0|5.0|Stevie Nicks is my favorite musician ever! I will buy all her songs. I'm her biggest fan ever! Been to many of her concerts.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, and it almost could be rated as the first of the series. It added a few good twists here and there.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Brilliant books! Really enjoyed reading these books - very well written. best read ever! All three books were very enjoyable, easy reads.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Easy read, lots of smiles, nice candid writing style and clever references to historic events.<br /><br />I downloaded the e-book and was immediately caught up in the story ... found myself looking forward to &#34;getting back to the book&#34; and read the entire book in just a few days.<br /><br />The story is not unlike the adventures of Forrest Gump ... the main character having a history of seemingly impossible (but incredibly funny) adventures ... before reaching his 100th birthday.<br /><br />Caught myself laughing out loud on quite a few occasions ... great book to take on holiday or to pass the time on a long flight.<br /><br />Have recommended to friends and family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app!I can't stop playing it.Every day I always thought that i should be playing it!I'd never thought that a great game could be extremely popular positively AWSOME!Always love ¡t!
0756405890|5.0|At first glance, I was wary that the main character Kvothe would turn out to be what people refer as a &#34;Mary sue&#34; , which is a character seemingly without flaws, who can do no evil, etc. However, as the story progressed, I found myself tearing up at his plight. Rothfuss's prose makes the emotion of Kvothe's struggles a viscerally real experience for the reader. Full of action and intrigue, this book is one to mark the annals of gat fantasy literature.
B008K93302|2.0|This product claims it will play .mov files.  It does if very poorly - slow - jerky - sound is not understandable.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|While this story was one I was desperate to read, it isn't one I'm desperate to reread.  I was glad to see them reunited, but I'm still not sure that I am satisfied with the logic of it.  The bondage stuff is a little much for me, but it works for the story.  This work was a typical second book.  It got us from book one to book three fairly well, but it isn't one I would love for itself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My love for reading was expanded even more after reading The Hunger Games trilogy! Thank you Suzanne Collins for the deadly yet amazing world you created!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book lived up to the first one.  I'm still not thrilled with the bondage situation, but the story itself was good.  I had trouble putting the series down all the way through.  The mystery in this book was fascinating.  I liked the twist.  My favorite part, though, was the Christmas scene at the end.  The author does a good job of putting us in his head.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|As usual I enjoyed Jack's  no nonsense approach  to the problem. Big and strong and talented. Wow what a man!
B00AA8Q0FQ|4.0|My daughter is very much into Monster High products.<br />Both movies are cute.<br />If you have a Monster High fan at home...<br />I recommend the purchase.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie, I love Steve Carell and his character is funny and fascinating but I especially love the ending. I would reccomend this to anyone.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Gives great insight into the mind of an autistic person.  I highly recommend the movie for those who simply want an inspirational movie as well as those who want to better understand the differences on how the autistic mind works.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Sorry gang, while the movie was indeed elating, the soundtrack is lacking.  Still, it's a good reminder of a great movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love being able to watch as many episodes in a row as I wish.  A real pleasurer for a good price.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|would you believe I didn't mean to buy this - without my glasses on I thought I was picking the rental.  But a week later I was actually glad that I now have it for more than 24-hours.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The kids requested that I download this game for the road trip to WI and they had a great time playing it.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|You can never have too many calculator apps.  This one has a decent amount of advanced features.  Not bad for free.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is another game we downloaded for a very long road trip with the kids. They had so much fun with the game.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This is  big, sturdy knife with lots of heft. A bit heavy when hiking, but I'm not afraid of it breaking. I don't know how it would work for cleaning game, but for most bushcraft tasks it works great.
B005HSL626|5.0|Downloaded for a long road trip with kids. It kept them buys and from asking &#34;are we there yet?&#34;. Thanks!
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|It's been awhile since we've heard from David Bowie. Aside from a few appearances here and there, he hasn't had an album since 2003's Reality, so any output by Bowie now is a treasure trove for music fans. At 66 years old, there surely must be temptation to go through the motions, but rather than playing out the string, Bowie sounds fresh, creative, and energized. It results in The Next Day being a gem of an album.<br /><br />His voice is still warm and inspiring, and he seems to be acclimating well to his role as one of rock's elder statesmen. The key to the album's success is that he's always keeping his backdrops diverse. Scuzzy rock song \\"Dirty Boys\\" slithers about, but eventually emerges from its cocoon with a hearty horn solo, while \\"Valentine's Day\\" and \\"The Next Day\\" are standout guitar rockers. And lead single \\"The Stars Are Out Tonight\\" is a catchy and well crafted pop/rock nugget. But he also has a bit to get off his chest. He speaks out against war on \\"I'd Rather Be High,\\" singing, \\"I'd rather be dead, or out of my head/than training these guns on these men in the sand/I'd rather be high.\\"<br /><br />Not all of his gambles pay off so well. \\"Where Are We Now\\" is a languid ballad that stumbles under the weight of its own solemnity, while his monotone refrain on \\"Dancing Out in Space\\" is a little too warbly and left field. But for each of his stumbles (and there are very few of them), there are plenty of winners like \\"Boss of Me,\\" where he is at his most charming and charismatic\\" He's somewhat self effacing as he declares, \\"Who'd have ever thought it/who'd have ever dreamed/that a small town girl like you/would be the boss of me.\\"<br /><br />With The Next Day, Bowie once again reminds us of his undying vitality and continuing relevance with another record chock full of great tunes. If it ends up being his last album it will be a shame, but it's also a record he and his fans can certainly be proud of.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not put down. Loved Holder! Easy to fall in love with . I really enjoyed reading how he and Sky relationship developed  into true love. I loved the humour, suspense and the sadness. Highly recommend!
B007CLSE8K|2.0|This movie was slow and the acting was not that great. Totally disappointed. I would however say that my 5 and 11 year olds enjoyed it so that would be the target audience. .
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing.... plain amazing. I'm speechless. It comes to a point when writing gets so good, it can't get any better
B009GQ57ES|5.0|The Heist is not only ravished by killer beats but also includes positive messages. Hip hop and rap are notorious for encouraging the party lifestyle, however Macklemore and Ryand Lewis do not. Great music!
B0071NLG0W|5.0|Enjoyed finishing the third book of the Amber Fox mysteries. Ms. Hodge not only knows how to write a mystery novel,<br />but puts alot of laughs in her books.  Hope to see a fourth installement to the Amber Fox series.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|always loved athena as a goddess happy to see a story revolve around roman counter part, never realized how completely different they are.
B00356CO1E|5.0|I purchased this because I feel just yuck.  I have no energy and basically I look like a busted can of biscuits!  I want to feel better about me but I don't have time or money for a gym membership and I have heard wonderful things about the 30 day shred.  I did it this morning and wow!  Jillian worked my ass off!  I haven't worked this hard since high school track.  I made it through the whole session with maybe 3 five second breaks.  It's hard and I wanted to give up but I just kept thinking about future me.  Me without love handles and me with clothes that fit like they are supposed to.  By the end I just wanted to lay down but I kept walking around and did the dishes, swept the floor, and gathered laundry.  I feel like this was a good idea because I was still moving and my heart rate was lowering naturally instead of me just falling over. I will update this in a week and see how I am still doing.  Also, I used the tip to use canned goods instead of weights and I felt like this was a good substitute. I will invest in some weights when I have kept this up for a few weeks.<br /><br />In the end, try it!  Your body will hurt but in a good way. :)
B008QTV3X0|5.0|cant wait to buy the second season and stream to my tivo.  we loved the first season, a lot like 24 which was one of our favorttes.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a great app! Amazing! I got this for my homework and I love it! It is very convenient and easy to use. You should get it!!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I purchased this app for my grandchildren, 2 boys (4 & 5 yrs old) on my Kindle Fire and on a Nook HD so they both can play and it keeps them very busy. They love it!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A great and suspenseful story - all the more so for having a factual basis.<br /><br />The acting and directing were exemplary.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Great film - a great example of truth being stranger than fiction.  Rodriguez is a remarkable and mysterious person  I purchased album following watching the film.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is fun, hilarious and is great at passing the time. It's very popular and addictive for a reason.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is great....it surprises me how much I like it.  I highly recommended this series....all 3 seasons! You'd think it might be boring at first glance, but you'll get addicted!
B003FALE3Y|5.0|This was a great episode.  All the separate story lines come together for a great adventure.  An adventure not with action for action's sake, but where each character have motivations for their actions.  Seeds that have been planted in past episodes sprout here and lend gravitas to the decisions that they make.  From Young, to Rush, to Scott, to even secondary characters, this was action well-told.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|This movie was quite entertaining, with charming characters and an interesting story set inside arcade machines. The voice acting was fabulous, and it is appropriate for the whole family. Definitely worth the rental!
B00BESFWBY|5.0|This is a movie about two very reverred surfers, Jay Moriarity and Frosty Hesson from the Santa Cruz surfing community. Santa Cruz is a surfing town, annually hosting surfing events for the world surfing community. Therefore, for Jay to rise to the status of surfing legend by the time that he was 21 years old is remarkable. Truly, his story is the stuff; that legends are made of. As you watch the movie, you are watching a story about a true life legend. And with every legendary figure in history, there is a teacher, mentor, guide who makes the journey with him/her. Frosty, still a surfing legend, is Jay's teacher. You will learn about the surfing culture and community, as well as how intense they are as athletes. Something many do not realize. Also, to my personal delight, you will see how intellectual and smart they are. Sadly, surfers are often portrayed as dumb pot heads or worse.<br />As a generalization, nothing can be further from the truth. May you enjoy being transported into a world that few, but true \\"locales\\"; know the truth about.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Apparently I have to write a review to rate the book, but I'm not quite sure what to say. The existing reviews are adequate to the task, so I'll just say this is one of the best books I've read recently, probably ever, and leave it at that.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|this is a very good mystery story written in a unique way that keeps the reader interested. I recommend this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The Pinterest app is very well made. It loads the pins super fast.  I can repin or create pins straight from my browser.  I've had no problems.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook....I can see what nieces, nephews, son, daughter, friends are all up to each and every day. I love it.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|It's wake up call! Youngsters will be challenged looking forward. Oldsters will be left behind or left out. The world will either harmonize or polarize. God help us.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book grabbed my attention and kept it until the very end.  The story uncovers the life of Henrietta and her family.  It throws in medical, science and social history and ethics from the 1950's to present, all in a most readable, stunning true story.  Days after reading this I am still telling everyone I know to get a copy of this fabulous book.  I highly recommend this.  Read it, you will not regret it.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Fantastic music, beautiful voice,so cool. I am playing it over and over. Love it. Thanks for the music guys xoxo
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome and really truly so so captivating. Kind of messed up entertaining none the less however ha jackie hangs vs
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This book is beautiful. It opens gradually like a rose. It is written as lyrically as a poem<br /> I am not a lover of fiction but will<br />read this again. I loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's just an awesome game!!!!! (:<br /><br />My score is 556301 boom!!!! I am never bored °·° ^·^<br /><br />BEST GAME EVER ... PEOPLE CAN HATE BUT THEY ARE JUST JEALOUS!!!
B00AHXIC50|3.0|I like some of the songs on this album but not all.  I would like it more if the language wasn't inappropriate on some of the songs.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|As an old retired guy, I actually use a watch for time-keeping [rather than my smart-phone].  Initially choose this Seiko SNK809 because it has the appearance of the old &#34;issue&#34; [issued to military personnel] mechanical watches [wind up, I think] that we were given when we first entered the military in the 1960s.  Those watches had green cloth bands, if I recall.<br /><br />I like the large &#34;minutes&#34; numbers on the outside ring [useful for celestial navigation, not that anyone &#34;shoots cel&#34; much any more], and the &#34;hours&#34; numbers on the smaller, inside ring.  The day/date is convenient [first watch I've had in a while that has the &#34;day&#34;], and the smooth sweep of the &#34;seconds&#34; hand is very nice.  Luminosity is good; it'll fade during the evening hours, but by then we older retired folks are asleep.<br /><br />Sizing:  my wrist circumference is just shy of 8 inches, and I'm at the second-to-the-last adjustment hole on the band [moderately loose fit].  I have ordered one of those NATO military straps [even though I worked with NATO in the 1980s I don't recall these watch straps at all; perhaps they're new?].<br /><br />All in all, a nice mechanical [movement is &#34;made in Malaysia&#34;] watch, reminiscent of the old days [like old timers like me].
0345803507|5.0|I love the series.  I read the whole series and have now passed it onto my friends and they are passing it on to their friends :)
B000JMKRKC|4.0|This is an intriguing read that keeps the reader asking questions. The plot is complex with interesting characters coming , going and reappearing. The author creates an authentic gothic atmosphere, complete with fog, rain and misty gardens. Not deep in a realistic sense but fun after all.
B009S33I68|5.0|I know that this book was the basis of one of the best movies that showed what Viet Nam War faced with the enemy! \\"We Were Soldiers\\" with Mel Gibson. The Vietnam War was different than any other war in previous history and faced an entrenched enemy different that any enemy in past history. Since I know how well this movie portrayed this war and it came from screen writer doing justice for this book, I highly recommend people read this to understand that war. Then stupid movie critics, who I have no respect for,  doing their stupid shallow looks!
B0058W74UY|1.0|It opens you to more advertising and spam which is unacceptable. I'm not pleased some apps find it necessary to run ads I know there's a cost but to text as well, no
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Pretty peod about my game I was up to 34 days in row had over 2 mill and 100 acorns and my game crashed and when it finally started working again it was back yo original everything gone. Pretty sad :(
B008476HBM|5.0|As unual this book was well written and was a delight to reread after many years that passed since the last reading.
B009G3T01M|5.0|Amazing rapper and producer combo. These guys are incredible and I'm so glad they're getting the hype they deserve. I love to hear macklemore's stories from his childhood because it reminds me of when I was that young as well. Hope they keep up the good work, can't beat amazon's price for this fine piece of work.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book made me feel infinite. That's what Charlie would say. In the book, we live with Charlie. We are there. We know him. We love him. Not only was this book interesting, it also teaches good life lessons and gives a perspective on life. This book is life changing and superb.
0670026638|5.0|This book surprised me. It was so much better than I thought it could be, and even better than the first twenty pages promised. In fact, every fifty pages, the book seemed to get impossibly better, deeper, receding before my imagination and becoming a vast and unexplored planet of possible meanings. I haven't been this excited to read a new author since I first discovered Murakami, but Ozeki has something that Murakami doesn't. Her characters are both real AND fantastical, which gives her book a different kind of weight than a Murakami novel.<br /><br />There are also some powerful ideas in this book, from both the tradition of Japanese Buddhism as well as particle physics, that make it not only a stimulating read, but possibly a life changing or at least a mind expanding one. The author has the fastidiousness of a scholar, which was a great relief in this world of endless quantum physics abuse. But she also has a subtle mind-- which is rarer today than brilliance and perhaps more valuable. (I'm not saying she isn't brilliant either-- she's a brilliant novelist with penetrating insight. I'm just saying her intellectual style isn't flashy.)<br /><br />I think the greatest thing to me about this book was that it caused me to think about women in a new way. The book is not overtly interested in feminism, which is to say it doesn't engage in any rhetoric regarding the rights or civil liberties of women, and yet it is profoundly empowering and examines women in ways I think are actually new and powerful. Even so, and despite the two female protagonists, this book is by no means \\"for women\\"-- my husband was hooked within the first five pages and then couldn't put it down.<br /><br />All in all, this book blew me away. If you are a woman, read this book. If you love Japanese fiction like Murakami or Banana Yoshimoto, buy this book. If you love to suddenly erupt with laughter on the toilet from reading a novel so that your husband worriedly asks through the door if everything is alright, buy this book. If you just love good fiction, buy this book.
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|I was expecting a puzzle aspect, or point & click aspect when I bought this.  (In my own defense, I was new to Kindle games at the time.)  Hidden objects, that's it as far as I could tell.  Admittedly, I didn't get too far because I'm just not interested in straining my eyes, looking for stuff with no purpose.  If there was a purpose to it later on (which I doubt) then life is too short to wait for it.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I cannot even begin to describe the difference this makes in pictures.  Once you learn to properly 'bounce' light, shadows are eliminated and the pictures are incredible!  LOVE this product!  a MUST purchase!
B00846TRHY|4.0|I love the story and the life change you see in this movie. Based on a true story so that makes it even better. Good acting as well. Overall a great movie! I would definitely recommend at least renting it.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|A story that many will be able to relate to.  Well written, great music and directing.  My only complain is that is too short, but is just long enough to develop the characters and allow your mind to fill in the blanks.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I began watching Doctor Who, on BBC America about two years ago.  I became a fan.  I had not seen the early shows, starting in 2005.  This series have been a great joy to watch.
B000IMMR1U|5.0|This is a sexy album. When you are feeling a little under the weather and need a pick me up, this album will do it for you.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|Still has &#34;Ads&#34; so don't get it unless you want to be bothered by them.  Seems to play a bit better than the previous version I had on the Kindle.
B004A8ZX28|2.0|After watching movies with Liam Neeson, this was a bit disappointing.  Haven't watched it all the way through. Maybe later...
B007BVMVDU|2.0|Well it could have been a great show I think but they can't help but keep trying to be the only show that has something special like nude chicks. To bad they have to keep pushing the envelope. Pretty soon there won't be a difference between porn and a TV show.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Best if Affleck I've seen yet. Exciting and movie left me feeling proud to be American.  Gutsy moves and directed beautifully.  Must watch.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|I just received my Invicta, but I can tell that this watch is really gorgeous!! Heavy, big enough and very sophisticated! The strap seems to be sturdy but need more time to be sure! It is made of some strong fabric and leather, so I hope it withstand the daily use!<br /><br />The shining metal case is remarkable! The chronograph is foolproof, so you can use it right out of the box!<br /><br />The calendar can be adjusted by bulling the main button once (first position). A sencond pull (second position) allows you to adjust the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game addidict but I love it so I play this game on my free time and I get so far but end up getting busted
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Really good.  While similar to Bejeweled, this product has multiple options for playing several variations.  Will keep it on my Kindle.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|We have watched all three seasons in as many weeks.  We love this period piece and the cast of characters that have been assembled. You can't lp but root for the heroes and sometimes even the trouble makers, let's face it they help keep the downstairs very interesting.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Ice Age has few instructions to let you know how to play it and when you figure it out it is just a little bit cutesy.  No challenge except for perhaps children.  I have already deleted it from my Kindle.  Also didn't like to have to wait to download an additional 60gb (kb?) just to be able to bring it up.
B009H442DG|1.0|I loved this CD and saw Olivia Newton Joyhn preform shortly after...A GREAT ITEM AND speedy service also! will do business again!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Haven't played it much yet but it contains several difficult game settings for various situations.  Graphics are good and angles and trajectories seem to be true.  I think I will like this game pretty well.
B004X80QNG|3.0|I've been using Pocket Informant for a couple of years on my iPad and my iPod Touch.  When my iPad broke, I switched to a Kindle and was happy to see Pocket Informant for Kindle/Droid.  However, I was one hour late for a meeting today because my 10 am appointment showed up as 11am. At first I thought it was my mistake until I realized that all of my appointments had been moved one hour later.  This had never happened to me on my iPad, so I must assume it's either the Droid version or it was caused by an update that didn't play nice with the time change to daylight savings time.<br /><br />I can't be the only one who experienced this. Please check this issue. This is such a great calendar app!
B005HSL626|3.0|Still haven't made up my mind on this one yet.  It seems to be well written and has a lot of good color and action but can get a little repetitive.  Jury's still out on this one.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Really enjoyed this book - its a complete page turner and held my attention totally throughout.  Ending was a little disappointing but probably necessary considering the plot line.
B008220BLG|5.0|I saw this on opening night in February and loved it so much, I brought my 11-year-old son (who is mature beyond his years) to see it the following Sunday.  I had a feeling he would relate on a number of levels to Nicholas Hoult's \\"R\\" and I was right.<br /><br />This movie is not only a fun genre-bending zomedy, it is an allegory for how too much technology in our lives has caused us to lose our connection with humanity, and some of our humanity itself, as well as a coming-of-age story, and take on Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />There are so many interesting things going on in this movie at the same time, it really warrants multiple viewings.  I caught things on my second viewing I missed on the first, like the subtle \\"Airplane!\\" reference early in the film.<br /><br />Jonathan Levine has done a great job adapting the book, which I loved, and directing the movie.  But it's Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer who ultimately make it as winning as it is.  I found myself caring about these characters so much by the end of the movie, I didn't want it to end and found myself thinking about what might happen next for them.  I actually read the book afterwards because I loved the characters so much, I wanted to know more about them.  Both of these actors breathe so much life into these characters (no pun intended).  I loved watching Nicholas Hoult gradually, subtlely regain his humanity.  There are not too many actors of any age who could pull that off convincingly, and that he gets that at so young an age is amazing.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough.  It is my favorite of 2013 so far, and I've seen just about everything else out there.  I can't wait to own it and be able to watch it a few more times.
B005K17RU0|4.0|gives good accurate weather. I wish that it would show the hourly temperatures rather than just the highs and lows.
B002UOQABC|4.0|If your into sleazy rock n roll (i.e. CRashdiet, Vains of Jenna, The Last Vegas etc.) this is a collection you outta have!<br />3 cd's and a video compilation of some of the Backyard Babies best work!<br />None the less, the photobook is something a rock fan can put on the shelf and look through anytime!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I look forward to reading Michael Matthews other books. There are great resource links to other sites and non biased reviews of supplements and equipment. The book is informative for both beginner and seasoned athlete alike. Highly recommended to get you in gear to make changes.
B00AW8VUDG|4.0|Not much to say other than Krokus keeps putting out solid music!<br />Nothing that's going to hit the stations these days, but a solid album from start to finish.<br />If you like to stomp your feet and move to some great riffs, buy this album!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris and his generation stepped up to the plate after 9/11. Willing to sacrifice years of their lives to look evil in the eye and overcome it. God Bless them and their families. This book opens  a look into  America's elite warriors lifestyle.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I loved the book and what he went through. It was sad in the end when you realize the hell he went through only to die at home.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really wish the writer would write this trilogy from Christians viewpoint. I look forward to her writing more books
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lags sometimes but is otherwise good. The minigames aren't too bad and it's not too difficult to rack up points needed to play them.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|As I said with the first book, it was well written, and never before have I been so enthralled in a book.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Bond, James Bond! Second best Bond ever. Second only to Casino Royale. Loved the action, travel, depth, and renewl of Money Penny and Q.

B000W91RUG|5.0|Leonard, Penny, Raj, Howard, Sheldon make this the best show on TV. No swearing, somewhat educational, geeks rule is a great message. Will buy every season ever made.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I enjoyed the book. It kept my interest because of the twist in the relationship. Some questions remain unanswered but not a bad book. I would have like for her mother to be more involved as well as his best friend
B0061PEAUY|1.0|If you speak French, then this book might be good.  My dictionary was not able to define ALL the MANY French words/terms.  This was not fun to read. Her excerpts are just as long as her book!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A very good novel that also brings history to life.  It brought back an era that I hadn't thought about in a long time.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I thought that this was a remarkable film.  The acting was superior.  DeNiro was phenomenal.  The scenery in the film was alone worth the purchase.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The art of life is racing in the rain.  Wonderful story, creative narrator, and inner wisdom...what else could one ask for.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Great thriller just like the first. Hard to put this one down. After reading the first one I found this one a tad predictable; also, a bit too wordy. Background descriptions went way too long at times but still kept me riveted. Reacher is a great hero-type character - can't understand how they picked Tom Cruise for the movie. Seems more like a Dwayne Johnson type.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|A friend rented this and brought it to my house for me to see.  I LOVED every minute of it and as soon as I was done watching it I ordered it,  to be sent to my grandson who in turn LOVES it. TYVM
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was a bit of a sleeper for me and I caught it by accident.  Was pleasantly suprised and enjoyed it very much.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The production quality of Downton Abbey is remarkable, the acting and writing are top notch. This show is worth watching
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Not in the exact same vein as previous versions, but good just the same.  Jeremy Renner is a good fit.
B000VK7KVQ|4.0|Good thriller with sympathetic characters played by excellent actors, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo, whom I always vaguely hated before this movie. The movie feels a lot more real than other crime thrillers, with the long investigations that often turn out to be false leads, and the time scale over which the story stretches. The murder scenes provides ghastly, yet necessary relief throughout the movie. The ending might not give enough of a  emotional payoff to some people but I felt it was sufficiently dramatic while staying true to the actual events.<br /><br />The movie is worth watching just for one scene in a certain basement in California.
B000P5FH3K|5.0|This has been a favorite of mine for years.  I needed a replacement DVD and decided on this copy and vendor.  Was pleased with both. Item works well and arrived in a timely delivery.  Fair pricing. Would recomend seller to others. Keep up the good work.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|The Pefect music for a great movie.  Howard Shure has followed up his great work on the Lord of Rings movies with a masterpeice.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I picked up this book when I was headed to Wyoming for the first time-- a little local color for my trip.  In short order I read ALL the Walt Longmire books, enjoyed the TV series and am eagerly awaiting the new Longmire mystery, due out this May.  Some of the reasons I love this book:  wonderful characters with many dimensions, great setting that is almost a character, humor, tragedy, the wounded hero, the bashing of stereotypes and breath-taking plot twists.  This is just terrific story-telling.
B00170MYIS|4.0|It's a battery, and I am using it in my camera. Seems to work fine.<br />I'd buy another if I needed it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I read Gone Girl and really loved it, so I thought I would try another one of G. Flynn's books.  I was not disappointed.  The characters were interesting and the story line was unique.  Had me guessing till the end.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|great game for a modest price. i never write reviews but this app was deserving. 5 stars. get it, you wont regret it
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|So, I'm a young adult; I have no children; really, I probably shouldn't still be watching kid's movies. However, when kid's movies are this funny, entertaining, and delightful, it really doesn't matter what your age! This movie was superb. I watched it twice within the 48 hour rental. I will probably buy it. A lot of the lines were completely unexpected, and incredibly funny. The plot was predictable, but there is something comforting in that at times. All in all, an instant classic in my book.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Like a great gripping novel you can't put down! So great to be able to be able to watch several episodes in a row. Incredibly well done.
B00AW8VUDG|2.0|If you're looking for the \\"Headhunter-sound\\", this CD is not for you!  I was very, very excited to hear their new release, but have already sold it back.  Like another reviewer posted, they sound like Bon Scott era AC/DC at best, then they just peter-out.  Boring, riff-less tunes with no soul.  Nothing like \\"Eat the Rich\\" on here at all!  If you like your metal more like mellow-rock, then get this by all means.  If you like metal with some punch, then stay away...  Just my opinion...
0375507256|2.0|The author is British and uses many British terms and speech.  He has a good control of words and writing skills, but I'm not British and got bogged down.  Gave the book to a British friend.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Really slow moving at the beginning, losing my kids attention.  Picked up in the middle, and the end was the best part.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I tried to use this with an iPhone 4S. No such luck. No audio, nothing. Had to return it.<br /><br />Would have been nice to know, as it is listed under \\"iphone mics\\".
B009K0P10K|5.0|Every episode so far has been entertaining.  The character development has been done with considerable attention to detail and plot.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have to say that my favorite bond movie was For your eyes only .  The scene where Roger Moors bond kicks the mercedes over the cliff was priceless .The ski chase,and mountain climbing scenes were great also. A close second is Golden  Eye ,but only because of the femm fatale played by Famke Janson. When she has an orgasm while killing inocent soviet scientists with an AK47 was fantastic. The look she gets from her superior officer is priceless. Then there is SKYFALL. and I have to say that it is by far the best Bond movie of all time. I have to say that Danial Craig is The James Bond.  I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. What I saw was unbelievably brilliant. The character development of Bond was very well done. There is one sad scene, but I'm not going to say anymore than that. All I have to say is do not just watch this movie. Buy it. It is that good. You will not regret it. This is the perfect Bond movie to celebrate the 50th anniversary. Nuf said.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Watch this movie a must see for any true rock n roll fan. Made me want to play the drums again! Great job to Grohl and crew.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've been useing this product for 20 years and can't think of any reason to change. It always delivers-time after time.
B00005JL2O|5.0|This is a really great and funny flick and it really brings the whole story line together i loved it.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|AMD Phenom II X4 965 Black Edition 3.4@3.8. I put another controllable fan for a push pull configuration but I don't need it. Running Prime temps are a respectable 47c with 25c at idle. Nice.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|This is a really different flick about a headhunter from New York and a jumior executive producer from California overall they try to have sex and not fall in love but it does nt work. A very similar story line to No strings attached overall both are really cute loved both.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Didn't really know what I was getting, but thought it was so cute, and being a cat person, couldn't resist.  It is adorable.
B0000639FE|5.0|What can i say about Jerry Macquire  this is a decent story about a sports agent  who realizes he has too many clients and none of them are getting the kind of personal attention they deserve. He gets fired for a new mission statement he writes in the middle of the night copies and distributes to all of his associates. One beautiful female associate comes with him. (Rene Zellweger)  In the long run they fall in love Jerry has 1 client at the time but in the long run they live happily ever after.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is arrally fun game and I am guariteed you will like and be addicted. becarful what you spend ur coins on though
B00005JKNC|5.0|Here we have another really decent story line of a case of amnesia  that turns out to benefit a comminity in a really gerat way as Jim Careys character  a hollywood writer and actor has an accident  and is mistaken for a  ww2 vet. But in the short run helps an older guy  reopen and refurbish an old theater and the older man dies happy thinking his long lost son had survived and returned from ww2. Its a great story line.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Okay, maybe I'm biased as a life long Justin Hayward/Moody Blues fan but &quot;Spirits...&quot; is just simply put, a beautiful listening experience. Justin delivers again with thoughtful and thought provoking lyrics which, along with the driving melodies (and I mean driving, they're great to listen to in the car) are at once soothing and will undoubtedly cause you your own introspection. As you listen the entire CD will sweep you away to a better place, perhaps where the cover photo is indicative of. I do wish, however, that as much as I like the previously released, &quot;It's Cold Outside of Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Broken Dream&quot;, and &quot;Out There Somewhere&quot; that their space on the album had been taken up by new/different originals (albeit they are all done as different arrangements.) Caveat, to get the full feel good effect of this CD one must listen multiple times before the tracks take you to where they will. If there's a Heaven (and I believe there is) I'm pretty sure that Justin Hayward will be there providing the ambient music at the Pearly Gates. This album is proof!
B007HOOAH6|5.0|A great way to have an entertaining interaction with our three young boys about potty time. It is so funny to see all three of our boys mimicking the potty dance with the boy in the story. As always, the simple, vivid coloring scheme is outstanding. Just a few words per page with big, vivid illustrations keep the children's attention well. Patricelli is a master of the children's book. Please keep more coming and make them all available digitally.
B004NOCCEG|4.0|Persuasive documentary outlining the coplicity of Banks, Wall Street, Government Regulatory agencies, the Fed, Academic Economists, and politicians in the crash of 2007. Very powerful.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I'm actually okay with spending more than zero dollars on this, I'm usually hesitant when there's an app I want that's not free, but I played this at staples and thought it was reallllly fun so I got it. No regrets!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Ive been waiting to see this movie but the movie wouldn't download therefore i never got the chance to watch it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great love it glad i made the decision to download and read this book. Would recommend to others. Worth the money
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game. It's a good way to kill time and I love horses too. Game is really easy to play.
0060005696|5.0|I Honestly only read about the first paragraph in this book before I got bored. It may be good, but I have CHOSEN to not read it yet.
0790729350|5.0|This DVD is now a valuable addition to my AV library.  I absolutely love watching it. Makes we want to jump in the car and head to Woodstock !
B003H9MSPG|5.0|I bought this gun for a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it!!!!!!  Very happy with my purchase.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again Vince Flynn doesn't disappoint!  And, like the others, this one was hard to put down once picked up!
B003B02PF4|5.0|I love John Grisham books but this one was different and a bit more on the edge. I strongly recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Amazing series.  My husband and I have gone on a marathon watching this show.  Got Season 1 and 2 free with Amazon Prime and just bought Season 3.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is moving, so full of life and its ups and downs and so very interesting with the large estates in<br />England.  Why do we have to pay for season 3 to watch them even if it is the current season???
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This show is so unique and unpredictable! I love it! The suspense and writing are excellent! So glad that I watched!
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Great HD quality and very entertaining.  Love to watch again and again.  There is no need to buy the DVD.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is fun. Its amusing and it teaches you to use Strategy. You learn to maneuver the prizes down the slide into the prize hole avoiding the gutter. This is a great calming game. I love it.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|How can you not rate this 5 stars? They've remastered their timeless sound for today's playback technology. Sounds even better than before.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|This is an OK book. It is an important book. I expected more. Lean In is essentially a longer version of the author's TEDTalk. I didn't learn anything new. She tells the same stories you have heard from her before, speaking or in articles about her. The book is good to start a conversation and point you to the website and, of course, Facebook page. I hope that a lot of good comes from the Lean In organization. The book features a lot of \\"shoulds\\" and examples that are not relatable to most people. Sandberg's story is a good one and I admire and support her for what she has done in her life and the mission she has with this book. However, if you are looking for a book that has a lot more actionable ideas and suggestions as well as examples from diverse women, the book Powering Up! by Anne Doyle is far better (once you get past the awful cover) [[ASIN:1456811746 Powering Up: How America's Women Achievers Become Leaders]]. I support the mission and the book. Anything to start the conversation is good and I hope Sandberg can truly change the lives of many women, society and the world. If Lean In awakens your passion or curiosity about women's leadership, you should definitely check out Powering Up!. Doyle covers similar topics, but includes more information you can use. For example, on the issue of the differences between the generations of women, Doyle describes each generation, points out the strengths and challenges of each and makes suggestions on how to work together across the differences. Doyle also offers strategies about how to overcome the fear that holds so many women back from leading, rather than just saying that we should. It would be great to see Sandberg and Doyle work together. I was very excited about the release of Lean In. I recommend reading the book to be part of the conversation, but I can't say it is the best book on the topic.
B00571F26Y|3.0|This is a good read - the doctor provides a lot of data to support his claims, but it's controversial.  At first I thought: Hmm....I bet there is a lot of truth to this. Then I approached the a local universities College of Agriculture to dig a bit deeper. According to these experts, the facts and data would not hold up against scientific studies<br />According to the scientist I spoke with:  \\"In short, the traditional breeding methods used the past 100 years have not changed the types of proteins or nutrient status of wheat as suggested in the Wheat Belly book.\\"<br /><br />My source also suggests that: \\"This book would never pass scientific review by the American Medical Association, the National Institutes of Health, the National Academy of Sciences, or any reputable non-profit or professional organization concerned with health or nutrition.\\"<br /><br />My suspicion is that there are many who truly are allergic either to wheat or to preservatives added after the wheat has been harvested.  Simply cutting out wheat may be changing an overall diet, cutting out empty calories, and eliminating a major source of fast burning carbohydrate. Anyone who eats a LOT of wheat and then cuts it out will also be cutting out a huge amount of fast burning calories. And if the eater has been consuming large amounts of otherwise processed wheat based foods such as mass produced crackers, cookies or breads -- the person is getting a lot more than just wheat.<br /><br />I'm staying away from wheat, but I've been allergic to it since a child.  I'm not 100% convinced that the stated data in Wheat Belly have merit.  More research on my part.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Managed to get my copy early last Friday at my local record store. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. If your a Bowie fan you should enjoy the album.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|this was one of the best series i have watched for a long time.the ending leaves you wanting more<br />can,t wait until next season.i was sad about the ending of season 3
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Tiles were to small.  Hard to read.  The other most important item that annoyed me. Was you could not repeat the same puzzle to complete.  You found maybe 5 or 6 pairs and your off to the next puzzle.  Than boom! You can not play until you purchase. Why wasn't this stated in the description.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Nothing Special and no it should be best picture. Then I heard it isn't historically accurate...<br />I think it won for political reasons having to do with wanting to go to war with Iran.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The first book I have read in 24 hours in years!!!  I couldn't put it down!  I thought it was well written!
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I&#34;ve read AK twice and looked forward to the movie. My wife and I turned it off after about 30 minutes. Very strange concept but we did not enjoy it at all.. very disappointed. I feel sorry for the great actors who agreed to be in this movie.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I think Avatar is one of the best movies to come out in years. The 3D effects are beyond awesome.  A great watch for anyone!!!!!
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|She did her thing. I give it only 3 because I prefer a more soulful flow. This is definitely a pop album.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It is a really good movie... In fact so good we bought it... try it out you won't be sorry
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Excellent movie.  We had heard a lot about the movie and decided to check it out ourselves.  Very good movie with a lot of intensity.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Have all three seasons!  Waiting for season 4! Definitely worth the money.  We watch over and over.  Beautifully done and fun to watch!!
B0012HRJEA|5.0|loved the music.. and the love story was so intense.  Shakespeare ROCKS! Leonardo dicaprio was awesome.  Thom Yorke's music made the movie perfect.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|This movie was a fun watch.  It is one of those films that has some flaws and it seems like you have watched it before.  That being said it is still entertaining.
B009HNDCC4|4.0|I thought the family sit-com had been done to death. But this show is great. The acting, the stories, the camera work, it is all brilliantly down. It is a show about a family, there is the tough old patriarch with a hot young wife and her persnickety son. The old man's daughter who is married to a good natured clown and has three kids. There is her brother who is married to another man with an adopted daughter. This show has everything and the jokes are intelligent.
081297381X|5.0|Taleb is a genius and provides a great perspective of the human mind as well as many faults. It provides an alternative and outside perspective many would otherwise never consider. Comes highly recommended
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I wish the MPAA would have allowed more man stuff on this. Oh well, still a well-crafted movie about struggling with a dichotomy of being a smart, well-spoken, design-oriented man who happens to be gorgeous enough to be a stripper.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This is definitely my favorite musical of all time and I love it. I am very pleased with my purchase.
B00005JM02|5.0|I've been meaning to replace this movie after having it stolen from my kids, and they were so excited to have it again. Thanks.
B009NNG202|4.0|Surprisingly very good. The main character is not good. Which is refreshing. You may not like him but you can understand him.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|average acting not worth all the hype. The plot was a good idea by the writer I just didn't feel like the movie could have been as good as it could have
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game. better than the first. its like a second chance. they should make a third, if its possible. recommended to play.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a great way to pass the time and also work your mind at the same time.  Would reccomend to anyone who enjoys working the brain out.
4770030088|5.0|Bought this for a class I was taking, it definitely keeps things simple and easy to understand. Workbooks are the best for language learning, in my opinion.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Didn't think I would be interested in this at all...started watching because some friends recommended it and it was free because of Amazon Prime.  Now can't stop.  Watched seaon two in one sitting...getting ready for season five.  Great show.
4770030096|5.0|Bought this for a class I was taking, it definitely keeps things simple and easy to understand. Workbooks are the best for language learning, in my opinion.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Just like always, Steven King delights the constant reader!  I totally got lost in the story and now regard George Amberson in the same light as Tom Cullen, a friend for life.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome and so fun I couldn't stop playing!<br /><br />The game is the best  game ever I'm not kiding.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|The book is a nice introduction t the series, the narrative flows well and the art is beautiful, overall a good experience to read.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|This is a good Bon jovi cd all the songs are great.... Stop bashing this cd I love all of Bon jovis albums this is better then the circle but that's only my opinion circle was good to but what about now is a very melodic album....<br />I've listened to it about 8 times since it was released at midnight...
B001VW9SH2|5.0|I think Viva La Vida is awesome.It is very addictive too!SO EPIC!SO AWESOME!Amazing!5 Stars baby!Woohoo!It is so awesome I never wanna stop listening!
B001MYIQK4|2.0|Was very excited to see the series released on blu-ray until I received the disks.  Scenes with little to no lighting strobed on my plasma screen and the audio cut out during certain scenes.  I asked Amazon for a replacement hoping that I got a damaged disk and upon receipt and playback I experienced the same issues.<br /><br />This is by no means a poor reflection on Amazon.  My beef is with the production company that was hired to produce the blu-ray disks.. they missed the mark on this one.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I originally bought it because of the stars in the movie and wanted to discover more about the movie so highly rated. I see now how sweet and wonderrful it is. As  I read the book's chapters, I could see Bradley Cooper and the others in the roles. Now I want to see the movie more and more when it is available!
B003K16P3M|5.0|Loved it! The main character is really believable, and the story line pulls you in. I recommended it to a friend, and he loved it too!
0307352153|5.0|Full of useful insights based on sound research, this is well worth reading, cover to cover.  I've recommended this book to many people.
B008602KQI|5.0|...but for once I wasn't at all disappointed! I absolutely LOVED the books, so I expected to be let down by the movie, but I wasn't! They did a great job with casting, and they were good about not leaving stuff out to make it shorter.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I quite enjoy this little coin pusher game. You can keep playing it forever because the gameplay itself doesn't change, though your coin regeneration limit will increase.
0470901071|5.0|Purchased for use and study by a relative whos job requires knowledge of computer networks as an instrument toward job promtion.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Definitely a great CD by Muse. I have given this as a gift and it's always well received. This music is from their earlier days and will always be a classic enjoyed by anyone who listens to it. You will want to have your own copy with one listening. Both the music and the lyrics are addictive.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I hadn't realized it was a teenage book. But it's an okay read. Not too demanding but entertaining enough if you're into predictable teenage romances.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|So much better touch interface. Solved all the problems I was having on my Kindle Fire HD Facebook. Better yet --- it was Free!
0061122416|5.0|Paulo Coelho is a fantastic story-teller. This book was adventurous, inspirational, spiritual, and blossoming with life. The main character was a beacon of wishes and hope, following a series of events that would eventually lead to his &#34;destiny&#34;. I highly recommend this book, I guarantee anyone will enjoy it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Such a different way to learn about the meaning of flowers through very special characters. I will now think about what type of flowers I want to send or give.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|A suspenseful Hollywood story based on actual events with classic movie techniques executed to fit the plot.  Loved the running gag and the plot twists.
B0082LUEW8|5.0|Great album. Want to hear much more from them, wish Dime was still here to make the sound even better.
B003VWU2WA|4.0|This controller can be slightly glitchy and has to be adjusted from time to time.  Otherwise, when it works, it works great!
B00007BHOE|5.0|Always great music.<br />They are amazing live but I never saw them with Paul and that sucks.<br />Great things will be coming.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Our entire enjoys this movie!  It is funny, sweet and my 10 year old has watched it over and over again!  Would definitely recommend.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|The mix of new story  ideas,  filming techniques, special effects, and acting makes this a classic. We watch it over and over and are always finding something new in the scenes. This is an essential series for all sci-fi lovers.
B000SEI230|5.0|Story was mostly predictable but very enjoyable and touching.  Had tears throughout the last half of book.  Truly an old fashioned love story.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We love the stories and the actors in the series. The quality is great and all combined we will keep coming back.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I think my expectations were way too high before reading this book from all the press hype from the movie awards and nominations.  I found the book's actions slowing down way too much in the middle of the story before the ending.  This book does handle some of the challenges of mental illnesses front and center.
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|And lone helicopter flying around a room is not much fun. Not sure when I'll have time for this app
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Very good production quality. HD looked great. Mark Wahlberg does it again and beats out Matt Damon. It would have been cool if Aflek was in this as well.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I enjoy just a bit more of a challenge. Also, it would help if you could access prior screens when needed, like when you need the safe code. Overall,  a fun, easy time killer.
1250007208|3.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />This is a story about a cyborg named Cinder who lives with her \\"stepmother\\" and two \\"stepsisters.  They are not technically her step anything since she was adopted.  Now, this cyborg is a mechanic and lives in a Dystopian earth in a city called New Beijing.  She meets Prince Kai when he seeks her out to fix his old android.  There is also a plague going on called letumosis and I assume that it is like the Beubonic Plague that hit the world back in the middle ages.  The story pretty much revolves around the ball that everyone is invited.  This ball becomes Prince Kai's coronation ball due to the passing of the current Emperor due to letumosis.  Cinder also becomes a \\"test subject\\" when her stepmother/guardian volunteers her against her will to submit to the letumosis research when her sister Peony gets the disease.  During the testing, it is then discovered that she is in fact not a human but a Lunar (or someone who is from the moon) and that she is immune to the disease as all Lunar's are.  The scientist also discovers that she is the long lost princess and heir to the throne of Luna.<br /><br />Once the king dies, the current Lunar Queen, Lavena comes to Earth in the guise of paying her respects when in fact she is bent on war and is interested in becoming the Empress of New Beijing by marrying Kai.  At the palace, she spots Cinder and discovers that she is a Luna and is threatening war unless Kai looks for her.<br /><br />Cinder crashes the ball (even though she was invited) to let Kai know that Queen Levana has plans for war and plans to become Empress so she can start the war.  This doesn't go as smoothly as she hopes because Cinder is discovered and is also exposed as a Lunar and a cyborg, both of which Kai does not know.  The story ends with a cliffhanger, with Cinder locked in jail.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br />I have mixed feelings about this book.  Although I enjoyed it, I had problems with most of the plot.  This was a pretty quick read for me but I expected more from reading the blurb.<br /><br />I'll start with the cons first.<br />1. Dystopian theme - The story takes place in a dystopian Earth after World War IV in a place called New Beijing.  Supposedly, this country arrose in the same location of Beijing, China.<br />However, there was lack of references to the Chinese culture.  True, the name Kai sounded Asian but his whole name Kaito didn't sound Chinese but Japanese.  There was a mention of chopsticks used but that was it!  I thought the author lacked in the aspect of incorporating the Chinese culture in the story.  Also, I thought the character Kai was not Asian, based on the description of the character.<br /><br />2. Lunar People - There was also a mention of Lunar people.  However, I feel that the author lacked description about the race e.g. how did they get there, why do they have powers, etc.  After readin the whole book, I am still looking for the answer to this.<br />Descriptions - Another thing that I thought was lacking was the descriptions of the places.  I didn't get the feel of New Beijing.  I wasn't transported to New Beijing.  Since this is a futuristic/dystopian theme, I would have expected the author to take us to the city/country.  I expected there to be vivid descriptions that can aid mu imagination build my own New Beijing in my mind but this never happened.  I picture New Beijing as a dump, overcrowded city, akin to the middle ages.  Now with my thoughts of the middle ages, I cannot picture having hovercrafts and other highly advanced machinery in the city.<br /><br />3. Cyborg - With the heroine a cyborg, i would have expected more from her.  I mean, she was cyborg.  Don't cyborgs have increased strength or something?  In this case, I see her as a teen with disabilites.  I guess this was what the author wanted the cyborg to be protrayed as but still, I felt it was unbelievable.  Cinder also did not meet any other cyborgs in the story.  I would have assumed that with the advancement in technology, there would have been others at least mentioned.  I get that the cyborgs were descriminated in that world but still...<br /><br />4. Romance - I thought the romance between Cinder and Kai was very underdeveloped.  I did not see how Cinder could fall in love with Kai and vice versa.  I thought the romance was pretty shallow.  Granting that Cinder was only 16, I would think that a love that can change the course of their world would have to be developed further in the story.  As it was, it just felt shallow and reminiscent to tween attraction.  Even the kissing was meh.<br />Now, on the pros.<br />I have to tell you that the premise of the whole thing is freaking awesome.  I give props to the author for thinking about it.  I mean, a cyborg Cinderella? An alien race living on the moon out to start war on earth? A beubonic like plague in a dystopian world?  Come on, don't tell me that wasn't an amazing idea?!  I had a \\"I wish I thought about this\\" moment.  I thought the android Iko, was funny and was an awesome minor character, although a bit of an airhead.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about this futuristic tale of Cinderella and hated the cliffhanger in the end.  I am looking at reading the next book Scarlet to see what would happen next.<br /><br />Originally posted on my blog I Heart Romance: [...]ith the advancement in technology, there would have been others at least mentioned.

B002VECM6S|4.0|Liked the price... and the person I bought it for like sports.  I did watch this with them-  it is pretty good and I like the true story of the family.  Definitely a decent watch.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I enjoyed the game so much I had to play it again right away. The object lists changed and it was just as much fun as the first try.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|I love the Goonies and this box set comes with a lot of goodies.  This price is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than the price of it in the stores.  The game is pretty fun to play as well.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It keeps you wanting more...the story line is quite interesting with quite a few twists in the plot line. I really enjoyed it and read it all in two days!!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|The movie is pretty good..  got it as a gift for someone and we watched it together.  I would recommend it to others.
B0016492BW|5.0|Shipped quickly and of course I love the movie.  Arrived in good shape.  I would recommend buying from here any time.
0684857219|5.0|'Lot of infos, heavy, great stuff, Arnold was indeed ahead of his time. If you think you saw and read everything about Arnold through various WEBS, you aint seen anything yet. Get your hands that one and read it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie first but read this book in a few days. I loved it, Quick is a great author, smart, witty and captivating!
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|Now that I've had a couple weeks to live with this album, I do find it pretty good.  If I had to pick one album it most reminds me of, I'd say definitely HOURS.  However, I don't think it's as good.<br /><br />The first 4 songs are great, without question.  But the middle songs - Valentine's Day, If You Can See Me, I'd Rather Be High - bother me. Not only are they boring, but they are just trite.  One thing about Bowie is that you can't necessarily guess where he's going based on song title alone.  Not the case with these 3, which are just as their titles say.<br /><br />The other 2 things that take this down a notch for me are 1) too similar tempo and feel throughout.  There are no uptempo rockers.  Everything just plods along mid-tempo, which could work except there isn't enough variety of sounds and mood to pull it off.  2) Bowie sings in his higher, slightly strained register on almost every song.  Like the tempo, it becomes a bit tiring.<br /><br />And my third knock is that it's too long.  I know in the digital era, time constraints have kind of gone out the window.  You could very well put out a 12-hour long \\"album\\" if you want.  But these 17 songs don't really flow together as a piece.  Aside from the aforementioned songs I don't like, Dancing Out In Space is a half-hearted throwaway and Plan is just an unfinished sounding instrumental.<br /><br />Overall I'd definitely recommend this to any Bowie fan, as long as expectations are not too high.  There are definitely some great songs on here, but it's not one of those I will repeatedly listen to from start to finish.
B00914JWSW|5.0|As usual if you like Babs then you will love this. I bought it for my husband & he loved it
B008VBYN80|5.0|I like it though I think that games like this should use less diamonds or real money but then again that's what makes this game able to be free so I think I can handle that.
B00136NVH4|5.0|An all time fav, who can pass up Meat Loaf.  Great theatrical music at its best, a true shame so many will not know the awesomeness of Meat Loaf.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Very enjoyable reading. Nice format of short stories for reading when have small amount of time. Good who done it stories.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|The fresh new sound is carried throughout the entire album.  Each song has a distinct individual sound, a welcome relief in the carbon copy musical world we live in.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|No Meg Ryan collection is complete without it. It's a must see. The story line is totally believable. The scenery is fabulous. Familial relationships are true.
B002RI98BA|5.0|If you're fascinated by politics, this book is for you - an historical narrative, based on rigorous research, that reads like a novel.<br /><br />What Lincoln did and how he did it, have lessons for us today.
B00005JKGK|5.0|The joy is bittersweet. The story tells of the four women in the maijong group and the relationship they had with their mothers and daughters. Every time I watch it, I learn something, about myself or about my mother. Watching it can help heal a broken heart or mend a relationship. Bring a hanky.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|I like both these actors. It had me at the edge of my seat. It has a lot of drama in it. It also showes how the judiual system works. And certainly not for the innocence. Gerard Butler is such a skill& professional  actor & he certainly showed it in this movie. Jamie Fox did a great job. And played his part very well as a lawyer. Just a great movie. A movie U got to see.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Love it so much. I have fun playing it. I watch the show when I was little now I can play the game
B000QXDED6|4.0|Like I said before about Gerard Butler. He is a great actor.He puts his everything into his acting. He can do any part in any movie he puts out. And he does it perfect. If some of the movies he is in & doesn't do well. I blame the producers & directors, and the writers. Because Mr Butler gives his best in any movie I seen him in. And works hard at it. This movie was great. I didn't like the ending. But not every movie can live happlyever after.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|it helps with school because I need to know what to wear and tells me if there's traffic around here
B0017SWPXY|5.0|great book. I loved the way that this book was narrated. it is from the first page to the very last page, something that gets in your heart and you head.<br />Another book My Brother recommended
B005EVVESM|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the songs on this cd.  I did not dream the whole disc would be so good.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This film is very well structured.  Each topic is studied individually.  I learned a lot about the food industry.  I am more aware and careful with what I put in my body.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Love the series.  Might be better if they inserted some grim humor every once in a while.  The acting, however, is solid and the characters true.
B003YUU62U|3.0|[[ASIN:B003YUU62U Crocs Unisex Hover Slip On Fashion Sneaker]]<br /><br />To date, I have purchased 3 pairs of Unisex Hover Slip On Fashion sneakers.  The 2 pairs made in China offer good quality workmanship.  The most recent pair made in Mexico left much to be desired.  And some of us thought \\"Made In China\\" is bad!<br /><br />Francis W.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|good app. kid stays entertained. would like to have an app kid could play n not wait for time n money. but love of horses keeps us playing.
0446530573|5.0|Must have for Italian-American Food Lovers! The recipes are well written and easy to make. Don't mistake that for meals that can be prepared in 30 minutes. Some of the best recipes take at least 2 hours to cook but it is worth it. You won't be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Another good read that is quick and entertaining. A bit predictable, but that is to be expected with this genre and knowing it is the second in a trilogy.
B005HED11Y|4.0|excellent job and thanks for having some old classics with good quality...only issue i have is that it should be easier to get to the shows we are watching to finish the episodes in a season than to have to search every time.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I think this was an ok buy. It wasn't as heavy I thought it would be with all the weights. The plastic under the mouse was kind of peeling off so I had to push it back on pretty hard. I think for all the features they had to cut back on some stuff which made it feel kind of cheap. Its better then my regular mouse so 4/5.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love this game I never know that they had this gems out there keep up the good work I wish you give out more game like.  Donkey Kong and pac man
B000FA5TTW|4.0|I had heard about the book and I knew the movie though I haven't seen it.<br />It was written beautifully.<br />The imagination of author was amazing.<br />All together it was the kind of book I like.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was an amazing book once I got past the slow start of it. I did not expect what was going to happen. I love books like this that just pull me in and twist it last minute.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album is awesome from start to finish. These two made one of the best albums of the year! That is no easy feat for sure & I'm sure that these guys have a bright future & career ahead of them. If you want an album to groove to this is it!
B005USZYDU|5.0|This book got my interest from the very begining and kept me guessing through out.  Will look forward to more of Theo.
0894803123|5.0|I have had this book for about 10 years and have made probably hundreds of batches of ice cream using the recipes in this book - always with success.  I especially like the sorbet recipes - the kiwi sorbt is the best! The recipes are strightforward and clear, unlike many other ice cream recipes that leave you scratching your head trying to figure out what they mean (by this I mean vague cooking directions or not telling you to cool the mixture before putting it into your ice cream maker - I know how to do it, but many ice cream recipes will confuse someone inexperienced in making ice cream).  The recipes usually make a pint (perfect for my cuisinart ice cream maker), but for those with larger ice cream makers or wanting to create enough for a huge party will have to increase the recipes; this isn't a big deal but I thought it was worth mentioning because a friend borrowed my book and expected to make a gallon of ice cream, but was disappointed by having only a pint for her party (she really should have thought it through, to be honest).<br /><br />If you are a real ice cream or sorbet lover, get this book - you won't regret it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book so much! It made me laugh and it made me cry, it was amazing, beautiful and so much more!!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Great game but it restarted right when I was about to beat the game I was so mad when that happend
B003204MQS|2.0|I was expecting something intriging and scarey that kept a person on the edge of their seat in suspense, however, the movie was boring, slow, and poorly orchestrated.  Would not recommend it.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Bought these for my husband he is a real Clint Eastwood fan.  He really enjoys watching them when he has the time.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Partly what I wanted and expected to read, and partly not. For my taste too much jingoism and self adulation. The worthwhile bits, in my opinion, were in the author's deployment to Iraq.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book will hold your interest! You will find when you have to put it down your thinking about it until you pick it back up. Then when your done you will be sad that it is over. It is a great book! This was my first read by this author and I am excited to read more of her work!
B002BBJ52U|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun to watch. It hit close to  home on a few stories, but is a great chick flick!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|addicting! upgrading and challenges have made this one hard to put down. it is definitely a must have for everyone.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this.<br /><br />This is the start of an epic tale, perhaps even broader in scope than Glen Cooks initially stellar Black Company novels, which it resembles. The world and characters are compelling, and the orchestration of many threads is well handled. The book is, by turns, dazzling and confusing in its number of players and their often opaque motives. The end is satisfying, however, something often lost in such sagas.<br /><br />Despite its length, the story is much better focused and less flaccid than Tad Williams early works. The magic has a poetry to it which brings to mind Patricia McKillips Riddlemaster of Hed stories. I'll definitely read on.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Wasn't sure if this movie would be appropriate for a 3+ year old...it was great! It made monsters fun, not scary!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|If you have multiple Macbook computers, then you probably have multiple chargers as well.  In my case, I have several chargers for my Macbook Pro, but I only had the one for my Macbook Air that came with the computer.  By converting my old charger to a MagSafe 2, I was able to utilize my old MBP charger for my new air.<br /><br />A side note:  if you have a charger whose wattage rating is higher than that of the computer you are using, the Mac can automatically step down the power draw and you can use it.  In other words, an 85W Macbook Pro power adapter can be used on a Macbook Air, despite the Macbook Air only using a 45W power adapter.  You cannot, however, go the other direction (45W will not charge the MBP properly).
B0094BB4TW|5.0|so easy to access this app. love  the size and picture on kindle. HAVE TO GET THIS EAST ACCESS APP
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is the perfect alarm clock for me. It has everything I need, an alarm with my choice of wake up sounds and a snooze. And it's very simple to set! Thank you for this free app! I don't know why people complained about the ads, they are the reason it's free. If they don't like them all they have to do is buy the pay for alarm clock app.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a fantastic love story.  Hoover creates an amazing amount of sexual tension just writing about a kiss! Personally I thought 50 Shades of Gray was trash.  Hoover knows how to write a love scene that is incredibly hot yet classy!  In addition to that this story has an unexpected twist.  I could not put this down and when I finished I immediately got another book by this author.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I really enjoy The Good Wife.  The acting is consistently good and the plot lines keep me watching.  There are often some interesting surprises.  I find the recurring guest cast skilled and amusing. It is not high-adrenaline excitement, but it is a solid drama.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read books one and two and wanted to find out the end result. I felt this book went on too long. And just when I thought I had finished. There was another 50 pages of epilogue to read.<br />I'll be interested to see how they streamline all this for the movie version.<br />Good luck!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I did not expect to like the Hunger Games trilogy as much as I did.  I thought it was only for teenagers, but as an adult I found it highly entertaining.  What I liked was that it was not totally predictable and it was not all about happy endings.  The plot is more intelligent than just tying it up and resolving things in a fairy tale fashion which so many books tend to do. It is unique, imaginative and well written.  I found it quite compelling and could not put the books down.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I bought this after he was killed.  I didn't really know of him before that.  After all of the news stories, I was curious.  I'm glad I did.
159514188X|5.0|This book is one of the best I've ever read. I think it's a good read for every young adult, and adult, because it gives you a new perspective of life. A brilliant, wonderful book!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's been a good while since I've really gotten into something new from SK, but boy did I ever here...<br /><br />This is a long one, to be sure, but it flows nicely.  Great imagery, great characters, great story... good stuff, indeed.
B008645YH6|5.0|This cd had more tracks on it than I originally thought, which was a nice surprise.  Quick and short, this cd went above my expectations.
B0079XNWQA|4.0|I really like jasons Mraz's music...haven't yet found anything i didn't like.Looking forward to getting more.seen him on Daryl halls show ....loved it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! I was sobbing at the end. A beautifully crafted story I couldn't put down.
B000301YY8|5.0|this is my very favorite so far.Between my car and pc its argument as to who gets to keep it the longest
B00ABO573A|5.0|I loved this film.  I think the themes of love and the horror and pain of addiction are all too real.  It was nice to see a realistic portrayal, and the concept that sometimes love is not enough.  Anyone who has a loved one battling this disease can sadly identify and gain strength from this film.  Plus, the portrayals were amazing, particularly Zach Booth.  A wonderful movie all around!
B0013FNC38|5.0|well guess what I like it too....looking forward to gaining more of your music.i love the rhythm ! makes for such a nice mood
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Well written book, but I'm not sure how I feel about the story in general. Not sure that I would recommend this book but I'm glad to say that I read it!
B000SZLSB2|5.0|Well James may i say i love your music and your thoughts.I have gone out of my way to get as much of your music as i can.there hasent been a song yet that i have heard that i didn't like or love.You have a fan in me.
B0052SF6CM|4.0|bought this for a gift for my kids they love it i heard and some of the track are very good would recommend this cd...
B003M70O5O|5.0|Love this show! Wish I had more free time to catch up on all the episodes. I watch as often as possible. Edge of your seat exciting and dramatic!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Fun movie. Adam sandlers voice does get annoying but still a fun show! The whole family from me and my husband to my 3 year old and 6 year old girls enjoyed it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch in general.  Nice music moments, some good laughs, and enjoyable characters.  It did drag a little bit, but overall, it was very enjoyable--watched it twice!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have been lifting off and on (more off than on) for 35 years and have heard most of what Mike Matthews has to say before.  But no one has put it all together in as concise and clear language as Mike has.  I wish I'd had this book 35 years ago and the stamina to stick with it.  I'm giving it one more shot.  I've been following Mikes' advice for a week now and already feel the difference from my old routine.  I also feel like a pig stuffing myself with all the protein, but hey, somebody's got to do it.  Right?  I'm 63 now and expect to be lifting for quite a long while yet.  Wish me luck.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was by far the best I've ever read!!! And I read a lot of books... It was an inspiring, funny, cute, sad, tale of how two people punched life in the face, and beat all the odds to be with each other.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|every time I sign in, coins are missing and my restaurant is changed and the food I was cooking is replaced with other items.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|CD arrived boxed nicely and on time. Sometimes when you buy songs that the artist didn't release when they were alive it is less than satisfying. I was very surprised at the recording quality and song selection from 41 years ago.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|On the album before this, \\"Diamond Eyes\\", I only REALLY loved half the album and the rest was just ok. Maybe it was because their guitarist Chi was absent and they were having a hard time dealing with that but the Deftones seemed less aggressive and passionate than usual. Thankfully here on \\"Koi No Yokan\\", the band feels revitalized and have their edge and inventiveness back.<br /><br />The songwriting here is amazing, some songs took me back to the \\"Adrenaline/Around the Fur\\" years while other ones incorporated the \\"White Pony/Saturday Night Wrist\\" experimental rock approach. I was surprised how I was reminded of all those albums yet the songs still managed to sound so great and well executed after all these years (and with Chi in a coma still). Nothing sounds stale here. This album has it's share of really hard, distorted rockers but it also ventures into the progressive rock realm with eloquent guitar patterns, atmospheric synth-scapes, and electronics.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Deftones or ever were a fan, you need to own this album. Like I said in my title, it's up their with some of their best ones.<br /><br />If you like heavy rock that is interesting and has variation, definitely give this a chance.<br /><br />Buy
B00328G4XY|3.0|If you are a total die hard Hendrix fan ( and I thought I was ) this is for you. For me the quality of my CD was iffy and the most of the songs were so obscure and 70's funky I won't listen again. Maybe a greatest hits CD next.
B0046MOVD0|2.0|I'm a Resident Evil Fan and have seen all of them, but wasn't impressed with this one. Probably not one I would watch again.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I loved this movie, very exciting.<br />After reading the book, I watched the movie and was blown away.  The movie stay very close to the events that took place in the book.  It is pleasing to see the words in the book come to life on the screen.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Well written, certainly makes you appreciate life, good health and true love. Be prepared for a lot of sadness with the author's vivid descriptions about cancer victims while at the same time reminding us how short and fragile human life is.
B004LROUW2|4.0|Where do we live? Is this reality real? Has the world changed without me noticing the changes? These are the questions that Aomame and Tengo ask themselves. Very impressive story. Although not sure about the final part for Aomame - isn`t it too much? Possibly whatever may happen in 1Q84 ;-)
B000FC2L1E|4.0|The charecters are so interesting and believable, while the adventures are somewhat preposterious, most people would not live through most of them, the history of the times and places are fascinating, she's an easy to read writer...keeps me reading...
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very funny, quite unbelievable but even though incredibly good story including political events in the world with PLENTY of unexpected turnovers!!!
B0094K1WZE|1.0|Characters with no depth. Predictable plot and action. Bubble gum for the eyes at best.  save your time and or money.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|On mac you get used to plug and play. This card requires you to go to the transcend website, get the driver MIS labeled as being 10.7.4 or lower when they mean higher, then it works. For downloading I'm getting whatever my SD card's max data rate is. I've got 45mb/sec SanDisc cards hitting exactly that the **second** time I did a transfer. I fully ejected then reinserted the card and got full bandwidth. First time I only got about 20mb/sec. and that was to the SSD rather than spinning 750gb internal drive.<br /><br />so for the price this is the missing SD card reader that apple left off of their laptops. great price, seems like a solid product so far.
B000N5F6OW|5.0|I love this show so much!  I used to watch this show as a kid and loved it.  You will too!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie was really great. Good humor and a nice life lesson. Don't miss on watching. Totally worth your time.
0920668364|5.0|I have wanted this book for a long time.  It's a beautiful story, Robert Munsch is awesome.  I am sure you'll love it too!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|We read this for a Book Club and had great conversation.  This isn't a Book Club book, but we managed to get through it and enjoyed hearing different reactions to it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Being X military this was a great book, its a shame after all Chris had gone thru to be killed the way he was.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|This has to be the cheapest Bond movie ever made.  Gigantic explosive and fight scenes are not the deep plot, cool Bond, great scenes we're used to, or expect.  Please get it right or don't bother!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Like the graphics, Could be better, but still nice.<br />I like this game, it helps me to pass the time.<br />Someone recomended this game to me and I would defy recomended to others
B000YH6YG8|5.0|Brutal and graphic with a powerful story. The movie is incredibly thought-provoking and the actors are absolutely brilliant. Very memorable.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Excellent read, hope there will be a sequel........hence the 4 star..did not care for the ending..a final verdict is necessary.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|The clothes and scenery are dreamy. Overall, a very lovely period piece set in the 1930s on the amalfi coast.
B00785P2QC|2.0|I am not very pleased with the fact that you are required to spend money to build buildings, if you don't it takes forever to build a city.
1416511946|5.0|I bought the book for my husband - and according to him it gets 5 stars. He said &#34;it's cool hearing all the stories about the band and other bands they partied with.&#34; I'd have to say it's a good book for any person who likes the big rock bands from that era, and any reading is better than playing video games :)
B009CPJHY4|5.0|An all star cast and a great story make this a wonderful movie without any bleeps. Just a sweet story.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I played this game for 2 days and just couldn't find a reason to keep  on playing it.  The mini game controls are buggy and the games are repedative.  Beyond the mini games you just buy stuff or work to get money to buy stuff.  There's supposed to be a goal, but there's nothing in the game that shows you are progressing toward that goal.  I guess you can proceed faster if you pay a LOT of money.  No way I'm going to do that.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you missed this show and were curious what the buzz was about, you will enjoy this. Great to watch straight through without waiting a week.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app. It's been a good way for me to wind down from the day and keep me busy in times I haven to wait for anything.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|DISAPPOINTING COMPARED TO HEAVEN'S PRISONERS. ALEC BALDWIN DID A GREAT JOB IN HEAVEN'S PRISONERS AND THE CHARACTERS WERE BELEIVABLE. IN THE ELECTRIC MIST, CHARACTERS DEPICTING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, ETC WERE VERY STEROTYPED.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Season 1, episode 1 really sets the tone for the whole series. The show runs at a hectic pace and The Strike Team always is up to something that is digging them deeper and deeper into the ground. Luckily (or unluckily) for them, they have Vic Mackey running the show. The actors all do a great job. There are a lot of characters that do a good job making the audience really hate them and at the same time understand them.
B00A6J9SM6|4.0|A pretty comprehensive book on Microsoft PowerPivot with clear explanations and examples of data models and formulas Look forward for a 2013 update on PowerView.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Excellent app for the kindle.  Very easy to use on the kindle - much easier than going online on the kindle and going to facebook through the URL.
6305428425|5.0|It was a gift for my wife. She has always loved this movie . It's like a classic for her.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I LOVE this series of books - especially if you loved Twilight or are a fan of Sookie Stackhouse or any supernatural novels.  BUT this is the most meandering and aimless of all 4 books.  It doesn't get going until the end of the book, you have to read to continue the final 2 books.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I simply love this movie..  the blueray edition is great.  I don't buy many movies but this one I watch over and over again... since the storyline is so rewarding.... highly recommend to sci fi buffs...  Jodie Foster is great in this movie....
B001HN6922|5.0|Excellent working condition! Great Movie! This Cars 2 movie is really cute and the kids LOVE it! I am so glad we got it

B003YL4LYI|5.0|so sad that there's not a follow up yet, so I'm reading really, really slow. I just ove this series.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|Its ET! The movie is a classic and this was a great buy! Worked great and we enjoy watching it over and over
B000FBJHZS|3.0|Started off as a riveting e-book I couldn't put down but became a little too cutsy and outlandish at the end.
0887431453|5.0|This book is great to get the children practicing basic skills. I bought it for my 3 year old and he loves when we sit and complete pages together. Its fun learning!
B003UBTX6S|2.0|I couldn't finish this book, so maybe my opinion isn't the best. I found it boring and had to get through....not because it was difficult to read skill wise but it was just so boring! There is so much potential with this subject and the characters that had already been created in Beautiful Creatures but this follow up fell flat.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the one I play that is like Mario Brothers and love this game.  Highly recommend to others to play this game.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This isn't a subject I'd typically find myself drawn towards but this book is very well written and I couldn't put it down. Loved it!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love the Christian values that Nicolas Sparks runs through his books.  This is a must read, great story, you'll love all the characters.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|The book had a pretty good story line.....The proof reader needs to learn about proofreading, lot's of grammar errors but the book is good....I hope that there are more books this would be a good series.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is a charming love story.  It is an easy calming story to escape into.  There are also underlying Christian values.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The best CD yet, and I have almost all of his CDs.  David Foster and Andrea Bocelli  together will always be a winner!!
1451695195|5.0|Enjoyed the book as it was written by someone who experienced this event.  Am loaning it to a friend who also has heard about this book and wants very bad to read it.  Thought it was great.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Great mix of songs.  Josh is one of a kind! I have all of Josh's CD's and each one is better than the last.  I am glad he didn't start  this album out with an instrumental!! We waited so long for his last CD and expected his voice on the first track, not an instrumental.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Never played Mysteryville but find it very interesting. Some pictures are hard to make out but once you get it you got it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was having lots of problems charging my Kindle Fire with the old charger provided with the Kindle.  It took a very long time to charge and sometimes wouldn't stay connected.  When I called Amazon and told them of this, they kindly provided me with this new one as well as the PowerFast for accelerated charging, even though my Kindle was over a year old.  Problems immediately solved!  It works very quickly and I highly recommend it.  Bravo Amazon!
B006JPS1OM|5.0|very addictive. Love this game, I haven't had any problems with it loading it works great.would recommend this game for those thar love puzzles and finding hidden objects.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|Excellent human real thriller. Great characters and research. The story got better and better. Involves a lot of real people
B0030B621W|5.0|Is a fascinating brain teaser.  Like a old &#34;who done it&#34; or a Alfred H. movie.  Really keep you wondering what in the world is going on with this &#34;this&#34; guy?  The ending is just fantastic.
B00ARAO0WM|5.0|What a Rush!!!  My husband an I bought this on a whim because of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, great acting and great action.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because It's fun and its the best game ever I sit in class and play it when I am done with my work and play it all day in bye.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Good Family Movie.  I watched it with my grandchildren ages 8 and 11, we all loved it.  Great for all ages, even 69 year old grandmothers.
B000X2H8G4|1.0|Waste of money, and I returned it immediately.  This didn't work for my needs, and not sure it would work for anyone.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|One of Fleming's best Bond books. The story never gets old no matter how many times I read it. This makes me imagine what Fleming's Jamaica was like. And the characters were some of his most intriguing.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very addictive!  Love puzzle games:-)  Can work on it all night long and then go back and try to best my scores!!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I consider this show the best in the Star Trek series. I have watched it several times and it never gets old. Recommend for all.
0800141601|3.0|Back when this was made this movie was awesome but action movies have come a long way since then. Still good but not great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It sure is a challenging game.  I have completed almost all of the games, but there are about a half dozen or so that I have not completed.  They have been challenging, but I will not give up.  Lots of fun also.  My 9 year old grandson likes playing this game also.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Well written, sensitive and educational....seeing what existing with cancer means from the perspective of someone living with the disease....changes in relationships, the tentativeness of life, living in the moment....fulfilling your dreams, loving those around you. I enjoyed it.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Very good movie, if I remember right this was the one with Heath Ledger in it.  He was excellent, deranged.  I would recommend it to others
B0090SI3ZW|2.0|I thought this movie would be better.  I like these kinds of movies so I couldn't wait to get it.  I judge movies I buy by if I would watch it again.  I would not watch this one again.
B000I9X54Q|4.0|Good movie to pass the time with.  Kind of dark in spots so hard to see certain scenes.  I would recommend it to others
B000QCTNIW|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was easy to understand with interesting stories of people's challenges. My son was born with severe brain damage and Dr.Doidge's book reminded me of the many types of activities we use to help him to be able to live a &#34;normal&#34; life. His story could have easily been included in this book. Because of the stories, this book is very inspirational. It gives you hope that there is something out there to help one overcome physical and mental challenges without using a lot of medication. I particularly like the chapters on imagination,thought, pain and the brain's connection to them. However, I was a little squeamish when he discussed the use of animals for research. Because of this book, I'm now playing brain science games and enjoying them. Good book!
B002RSQGQK|5.0|I would definately recommend this movie to others, Hitchcock was one of the best directors ever, his suspense, lighting techniques and plots were always great.  this was just one of his classics.  I had to compare this movie to Distubia for a class.  Both were full of suspense and I did enjoy both of them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm a die-hard CSI, Poirot, The Closer, Midsomer Murders, etc. addict. Can't stand the reality, talent, and other drivel that is on TV. So I was very surprised how hooked I got on DA. What a terrific cast, scenery, and story lines. I love that it's like getting two stories for the price of one (the family line and the staff line). And Maggie Smith's one-liners is the icing on the cake. Truly a masterpiece in television programming.
B00BDPW7XE|5.0|... they surprise us yet again. What can I say about the conclusion to last year's awesome \\"English Electric(part one)\\" that hasn't already been said ? This record is inspiring ... it gives me hope for the future of music that a group of guys, some of whom still have Day Jobs, can continue to get better with every release. Like a lot of others I was blown away by \\"the Underfall Yard\\" thinking they'd hit their Zenith, & then with each successive release they have surpassed their previous offerings. And now, we have the conclusion to \\"English Electric\\" and it is every bit as good as anything anyone has done in the past 10 years. I would say that it's a shame that they aren't exposed to a wider audience, but it really doesn't matter. As long as their fans are happy & the music pays for itself, the band is content to keep on doing what they love. & that is why it is so good ... they are not concerned with what they THINK the public might want, they just make the music the love & strive to do it to the best of their ability. And so far, their best puts them head & shoulders above nearly every other artist recording today.
1250027624|4.0|This is a  well-laid-out book with a lot of information for those of us who love Downton Abbey. The photos are glorious, and the book is worth getting for those alone!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game very much.  Collecting the coins is a real challenge. We play it every day after school, on my grandmas kindle.

B008476HBM|4.0|One of the first romantic novels. Highly romantic and it is the cultural customs of those 19th century days that hold your<br /> interest. It's a love tale with a bit of a punch.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|Well, the &#34;old&#34; series is not like this new one!  Of course, I would have expected that.  The setting is the same.  Updated colors and furnishings have brought 165 Eaton Place into a new age.  And, of course, things are nicely tied together with Jean Marsh playing Rose Buck once again.<br /><br />Otherwise, the story is familiar.  The upstairs family has their difficulties while the servants downstairs experience a different set of trials.  I enjoyed this new series for what it is.  The drama and intrigue have remained with this modern re-do of a favorite classic.  Relax, grab a cup of tea, and enjoy!
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I've seen some pretty poorly done transfers of older movies to Blu-Ray format, ones that look little better than the standard definition DVD version.  This one looks very good.  Very good indeed.<br /><br />I watched this movie in Germany when it was first released, and loved it.  Had it on DVD and loved it, now on blu ray and I love it even more.  Very crisp and clear picture.  The menu is quick, no frustrating animation that takes forever to do what you want it to do.  Play kicked off right away.  Even the time menu for skipping chapters is well done and very very visible - brown blocks that look like the top of a flute and a nice thumbnail of the chapter that you're jumping to.<br /><br />The Extras on the DVD (deleted scenes) is nice - Ron Howard talking about the movie and things they did gives some nice insight.  The only downside is the 4:3 format for some of the extras, but the deleted scenes themselves are in the widescreen format and look good, although some of them you can tell they didn't get the audio processing finished.  But they give some nice insight to the story since some of them are deleted story arcs and backstory bits that they cut for time.  But the sad thing is that there's only a few of them, a total of like 12 and a half minutes total, half of that is Ron Howard talking about things.  I had expected a movie like this to have had more deleted scenes, but there's the other extras such as the Making Of (a little under 24 minutes long), a part about the morphing (not quite 17 and a half minutes long), the video journal of Warwick Davis (just under 11 minutes long and has some slick footage from when he was just starting acting in Return of the Jedi as a 13 year old in an Ewok outfit), and the matte paintings.<br /><br />The story's been reviewed often enough so I'll just suffice it to say that it's still a joy to watch, even all these years later.  The action scenes are crisp, and the special effects actually look a little less obvious than they did on the DVD.  I remember the brownies and the hydra-like creature looking painfully done on the DVD, and while it's still obvious in some scenes how things were superimposed, it's far less glaring and in some scenes is not even noticeable.<br /><br />If you were a fan of the movie, and have a Blu-ray player, this is a MUST have for any collection.  Worth every penny, very well done.y did on the DVD.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I've only recently got interested in HO games with a story line.  Love the spooky ones and this fits the bill.  It seems fairly easy. Maybe I'm just getting better at playing because I haven't used the tools.  The hint button is pretty much all I need.  Also like the Monoco option for a change from the HO puzzle.  Not finished yet, but would recommend this game.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a very good bit of sci fi that sets up an interesting situation, of all these people living in this silo in the ground with some rather brutal rules.  A lot happens and you learn more but not all in this book about what the silo might be.  Read First shift to find out who built the silo and why?  That is good too, though is slower. These keep me really engrossed.  Great concept and fun read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|We have Direct TV and cannot get &#34;local&#34; weather.  We get what we call the Weather Channel's metro-weather (the whole United States as an overview).  The AccuWeather App allows us to select a location and get really good weather either at home or when we are traveling.  We like the feature that allows us to put the satellite in motion to enable us to see which way storms are moving.  Getting the 15 day weather for other locations has been wonderful.  We know what to pack and how to prepare for weather emergencies.  I used the Weather Channel App on my Android prior to getting  the AccuWeather App and the AccuWeather info is more accurate than the Weather Channel info. Thank You

Glad I found it-looking forward to many hours of enjoyment and challenges!!<br /><br />Have been playing for awhile and this is my favorite bingo game.

B0054SMIH6|4.0|Its a lawyer movie with alot of cool stuff thrown in the mix... And drives around in a lincoln<br /><br />Good rental.
B008MU8ZOI|4.0|Imaginative cult classic, with a unique lead character. Very credible Blu ray conversion. The rest of the series needs to be released on Blu ray.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I couldn't wait to wait to get home at night to watch another session in the series.  The story line approach was very clever in adding both the upper floor and lower floor elements -- you were able to follow not only the family but the servants that worked in the house.
B005HSL626|4.0|I really love this game. its great to pass the time by with. but I'm only giving it four stars because all of a sudden. y game stopped loading and everytime I opened it up it would just close automatically. now I had to uninstall it and redownload it again. but it really is GREAT fun!!!

B0073L91MW|5.0|The film is very good and of course Sean Bean & Danny Dyer brilliant - I was interested in Ian Flemings naval intelligence war.    I first came across this story recently on the BBC near to a local hospital and I cannot believe that the conversation that caused this article took place at Moorfields Eye Hospital - no pun intended - \\"Then came the real eye-opener.\\"  Of course Dieppe was tragic - a Canadian slaughter thanks to Mountbatten. Mountbatten was assassinated in Sligo Bay in 1979 - I was camped on the beach when it happened and I still believe it was a Canadian reprisal for Dieppe & the PIRA was the \\"Patsy\\".  Mountbatten's real name was Battenberg which he changed in 1947 - he was a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg as is the Duke of Edinburgh but Phil the Greek had a distinguished war fighting for us in the Mediterranean. I never realised Brits were on Utah Beach. JGM  [...]  6 March 2013 Last updated at 06:34 GMT  When Ian Fleming picked my grandfather to steal Nazi secrets  By Justin Rowlatt BBC News  30AU posing with a captured German flag 30AU posing with a captured German flag  Continue reading the main story  In today's Magazine      Jews invited back to Spain after 500 years    7 questions on lateness    The children going hungry in America    When are we going to learn to trust robots?    When naval intelligence officer Ian Fleming set up a secret commando unit during World War II, among those handpicked for duty was Theo Ionides - my grandfather. His band of real-life James Bonds helped change the course of the war.    My grandfather was - at 39 - already an old man by military standards when he joined Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in the early years of World War II. So it was perfectly plausible when he told my grandmother that they kept him well away from the front line, out of harm's way.    His story was that the Admiralty had got him doing dull, technical stuff, poking around in the innards of new torpedoes and mines. But that couldn't be further from the truth, as my family discovered just a couple of years ago.    In fact my grandfather, Lieutenant Theo \\"Rusty\\" Ionides, had been handpicked by none other than Ian Fleming to be part of the Bond creator's top secret crack team of commandos. He'd been trained in all the tricks of intelligence gathering, ready to be sent into battle ahead of the advancing troops at D-Day.    The story of 30 Assault Unit, as the commandos were known, is a tale of audacious derring-do. 30AU was Commander Ian Fleming's greatest single contribution to the war effort and became the real-life inspiration for his most famous creation, James Bond.  Continue reading the main story  Real-life 007  Ian Fleming in 1950s      Ian Fleming was a WWII naval intelligence officer    Personal assistant to both directors of naval intelligence    Founded and oversaw 30 Assault Unit    Poured his personal experiences of wartime espionage into the 007 books    First James Bond novel, Casino Royale, written at his holiday home in Jamaica in 1952      Find Ian Fleming in the BBC Archive    Source: Ian Fleming's Estate    It all began in the now famous Room 39 of the Old Admiralty Building. This oak panelled office overlooking Horse Guard's Parade and out across to the garden of 10 Downing Street is where Fleming worked as a volunteer officer in naval intelligence throughout WWII.    It is a sterile place now, used for training and lined with white Formica-topped tables and a large whiteboard. According to Nick Rankin, a historian who has written the definitive history of the unit - Ian Fleming's Commandos: The Story of 30 Assault Unit in WWII - it was very different place 70 years ago. Bakelite phones would have been ringing incessantly, filing cabinets crashing open, the fire crackling in the hearth.    Then, Room 39 was packed with men, all smoking like chimneys. These were the cream of naval intelligence, tasked with using their guile and imagination to come up with novel ways of confounding the Germans.    Overseeing them from the adjoining office was the formidable Admiral John Godfrey, their boss and the inspiration for M in the James Bond novels.    And back at the start of the war, the main preoccupation of his team was how to address a key British weakness - the fact that the Germans led the Allies in all sorts of technologies - encryption, rockets, submarines, torpedoes, mines and much more.    In 1942, Fleming proposed a simple solution - steal it.    His plan is outlined in a succinct single-page memo, hammered out on a typewriter in Room 39. It is headed Proposal for Naval Intelligence Commando Unit and right from the first paragraph it is clear that - in the spirit of 30AU - the idea itself is stolen.  Fleming's memo    See clickable version of Ian Fleming's secret memo in full    \\"One of the most outstanding innovations in German intelligence is the creation by the German NID [Naval Intelligence Division] of special intelligence 'Commandos'... their duty is to capture documents, cyphers [sic] etc before these can be destroyed by the defenders,\\" writes Fleming, under his codename F. \\"I submit that we would do well to consider organising such a 'Commando'.\\"    Godfrey's response is plain to see. \\"Yes,\\" he has scrawled in large letters at the foot of the page. \\"Most decidedly.\\"    30AU was born.    In essence what Fleming was proposing was a team of authorised thieves and looters - mavericks who would operate ahead of the forward troops and who were instructed to do whatever necessary to capture enemy intelligence, equipment or personnel.    The men of 30AU were trained in all the key commando skills - hand-to-hand combat, booby traps and explosives. Many learned to parachute, handle small boats or dive as frogmen. They learned how to break and enter, how to pick locks and crack - or blow - safes (and were required to sign a document promising not to use these new skills in civilian life).

Continue reading the main story  1/7    But despite their considerable skills, the first foray of A Commando, as it was known then, was not a success. It came in August 1942 when they were part of the disastrous Allied assault on Dieppe. Fleming was there in person to witness the disaster - his only experience of battle.    Paul McGrath is one of the last survivors of that raid. He's now 90 but still has a ramrod straight back. His clear, bright eyes sparkle and his face lights up as he recalls his adventures with the unit. Except when I ask about Dieppe.    He remembers sitting hunched on the deck of the destroyer taking him and his comrades into battle. As they approached Dieppe, the German gunners, dug into emplacements in the cliffs, opened up with everything they had. A large shell exploded just 20ft (6m) from where he sat.  Continue reading the main story  “Start Quote  Paul McGrath      I lay on the deck with a sort of premature rigor mortis”    Paul McGrath    More than 70 years on from that day, McGrath searches for words to describe the abject terror that gripped him as the blast wave hit. He says he was \\"frozen on deck, completely paralysed\\".    \\"I was petrified with such a terror it stunned my mind,\\" he has written. \\"I lay on the deck with a sort of premature rigor mortis, immobilised by the awful thought of an immediate and terrible death.\\"    That, he says, is when what had been for him the game of war turned deadly serious. \\"The sods were actually trying to kill ME!\\"    When the landing craft became lodged on a submerged object just a few metres from the beach, he realised the game was up. Machine and cannon fire rained down from the cliffs as McGrath and the other commandos stripped off their kit, throwing aside their weapons.    Those that could swim dived off the boat and swam for their lives through a seafoaming with bullets. McGrath - not a strong swimmer - says he was beginning to go under when the smokescreen cleared and he was spotted by a small Allied boat which dragged him aboard. It was the first of many close calls for McGrath.    But almost 1,000 other men had no such luck. They died in the raid at Dieppe, which most military scholars regard as an unmitigated disaster. Fleming's commandos came back empty-handed. They hadn't even stepped ashore.  Tanks on the beach at Dieppe, 1942 A British landing vessel and tanks after the Dieppe raid    Yet back at the Admiralty, Godfrey had not lost faith. Replacements were recruited for the lost men and the team was prepared for Operation Torch, the assault on North Africa.    Here Fleming's Red Indians, as he once called them, were more successful. They were deployed again during the offensives in Malta, Sicily and the Italian mainland during 1943. This rag-tag collection of marines and intelligence experts seized codes, secret documents and all sorts of novel German kit including an Enigma machine. They even bagged an Italian admiral.    So when the Allies were planning the greatest offensive of them all, Operation Overlord - code name for the Battle of Normandy, starting with D-Day - top brass wanted 30 Commando, or 30AU as the troop had been renamed, to be part of it.    That meant more personnel so, while 30AU was at work in the Mediterranean, back in Britain the men of Room 39 were busy recruiting. At a new base in Littlehampton, West Sussex, this new cadre was being trained in the essential commando skills. Among them was my grandfather.  Lieutenant Theo \\"Rusty\\" Ionides with his daughters Penelope and Anthea at Hampton Court Palace Lt Ionides with Anthea and Penelope (right) on their outing to Hampton Court months before he died    A key condition of joining the unit was absolute secrecy. All members had to sign the Official Secrets Act. So my grandfather told my grandmother nothing about his new role. She knewhe had been in training before he visited London in March 1944, but not what his role was to be.    The last pictures of him were taken on that visit when he took his two daughters - my mother Penelope and her sister Anthea - to Hampton Court Palace on a spring afternoon.    The family only discovered his involvement a couple of years ago, thanks to a coincidence.    My cousin Alexander is an eye doctor at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London and the only one of the family to carry my mother's maiden name, Ionides.    One day a patient asked him a startling question.    \\"Ionides is an unusual name,\\" he said. \\"Was your grandfather called Theo?\\"    \\"Yes,\\" replied Alexander.    \\"Did he fight in World War II?\\"    \\"Yes,\\" he answered again.    Then came the real eye-opener.    \\"Did you know he was handpicked to be part of a top secret commando unit set up by Ian Fleming?\\"    The answer to that question was a resounding no. This amateur historian had opened a chapter of family history that we had no idea existed.    My grandfather was born in March 1900, the middle child of a well-to-do family of Greek origin that had fallen on relatively hard times.  Continue reading the main story  “Start Quote  Allen Royle      I remember the medical orderly opening the buttons on your grandfather's shirt”    Allen 'Bon' Royle    We've got the letters he wrote from school to his parents. It is clear he was very excited by WWI and eager to join up. As soon as he was 18 he joined the Royal Navy but during training, the war ended and Midshipman Ionides didn't - to his disappointment - ever see action.    He left the navy shortly afterwards and secured a place at Oxford in the university's new discipline, engineering. He never finished his degree - we don't know why - but his engineering expertise was to find a useful role in the next war.    Theo never really settled down. In the early 1920s he went to work for the Greek merchant company Ralli Brothers in India. His sister Elfrieda apparently told him the parties were fantastic.    But Ralli Brothers did not prosper and the company's Indian operations were closed in 1930. He returned home to London and, with Britain in the grip of the Great Depression, found himself unemployed. He finally managed to get work at a dry cleaning firm. This was a brand new technology in Britain, and probably more glamorous than it seems now.    Nevertheless, when war was declared in September 1939, he was very eager to sign up.    Having served as a midshipman, the obvious place for him was the navy. According to family legend, he had quite a struggle to persuade them that a 39-year-old could be useful, even lying about his age to get in. It was his engineering skill that did it.  Continue reading the main story  Find out more    Justin Rowlatt's films on 30AU will be on The One Show on BBC One, 6 and 7 March at 19:00 GMT      Or catch up with iPlayer    He was finally offered a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve.    My grandfather became an expert in torpedoes and mines. He was deft at defusing the things, but also had an eye for technology, so was sent abroad to try and scout out new weapons.    It seems he caught Fleming's eye when he brought the innards of some particularly intriguing new torpedo back to the Admiralty from Sicily.    After a couple of months of commando training in Littlehampton, he was bundled on to a boat to join the greatest sea-borne invasion force in history - the D-Day landings.    Unfortunately he was not to play a big role in what happened next.  Continue reading the main story  The D-Day landings  View from a barge dropping troops on D-Day    The Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, codenamed Operation Overlord, took three years of meticulous planning by the Allied forces. A naval and aerial bombardment supported the main amphibious assault to drive the Germans out of occupied France.    The coastline chosen for the invasion, running from Carentan in the west toCaen in the east, was divided into five beaches. A series of prefabricated piers - used to roll equipment and supplies ashore - stretched seven miles along the coast. The first day of the assault ended with 150,000 men onshore, but this came with the loss of 2,500 men. It marked the beginning of the end of the war in Europe.      Listen to people who experienced D-Day first-hand    I've managed to track down three surviving veterans of the unit, men who were with him on that journey. None knew my grandfather in life, but 70 years on, all three remember his death very vividly indeed.    Four days after D-Day, the landing on Utah beach was easy. \\"Like stepping ashore at Margate,\\" recalls Pte Bill Marshall.    The problems came after 30AU bedded down for the night in a field a few miles inland. The veterans all remember the German plane that suddenly appeared over the hedgerow and the bombs it dropped - a new kind of anti-personnel weapon, they were later to discover.    Almost 70 years on, I sat with each of them as they described how the shower of bomblets it released exploded, sending spinning scythes of shrapnel hurtling out over the field.    \\"There was a kind of humming and fluttering like butterflies,\\" says Marshall, clearly still intrigued by the sound after all these years.    But there was nothing gentle about this weapon. Twenty-two men were injured, three fatally - one of whom was my grandfather.    Allen Royle - \\"Bon\\" Royle as he became known in the unit - tells me how he walked over to where the injured men were lying, many screaming in agony.    \\"I remember the medical orderly opening the buttons on your grandfather's shirt. I don't know why I remember it so well, but I do. His shirt was soaked in arterial blood,\\" he tells me.    \\"The orderly opened it up and I could see his chest and the entry wound where the shrapnel went in - I think it was a bomb fin. He would have died immediately, I'm sure of that.\\"    He is matter of fact as he says this. It is clear that Royle saw many horrific things during the war.    I'm surprised now how unmoved I am as he describes my grandfather's death. I suppose I am insulated from the horror by seven decades, and by the journalist in me who is keen to hear the facts - excited by these old men's stories of wartime derring-do.  The telegram informing his family of Ltn Ionides' death    It is a different story in Normandy.    Bon Royle and his son Nick made the journey back to Utah beach and retraced the unit's movements. Nick Royle texted me a photo of the map of Normandy they'd used. He'd circled a field in pencil.    A few weeks later a farmer leads me towards the spot marked on the map. He had no idea that any English soldiers had died there. Paul Woodage, the military historian who accompanies me, isn't surprised. So many people died in the days after D-Day, no-one knows where all of them fell.    We continue through the mud towards a gate into another field.    \\"I'm not superstitious, but lots of people just know when they are in the right place,\\" Woodage suggests.  Map The map Nick Royle texted - the field is circled on the right    I'm not superstitious either, but he's right. We walk through a gate and into the field and it just feels right - this is where it happened. All the glamour and excitement of the connection with Fleming and James Bond evaporates.    That's when I remember the famous Rupert Brooke poem about the nobility of dying for your country and the \\"corner of a foreign field that will be forever England\\".    I am proud of my grandfather and I believe the cause he and the others who died there were fighting for was noble. But the fact is that standing in the field where my grandfather died doesn't make the pain of loss my mother has carried all her life any more meaningful. If anything it makes it less so.    This place will never be forever England, I think. This is a miserable place for anyone's life to end.    I turn and trudge away, feeling hollow.    But as I walk I begin to wonder if I'm being hasty. I have no doubt that he would have been very proud of what 30AU went on to achieve.    His comrades seized the entire German naval archive, later used as evidence in the Nuremberg trials. They captured top-secret German technology and some of the scientists behind it, and even played a part in the capture of Hitler's successor Admiral Karl Doenitz, thus sealing the end of the Third Reich.    Of course this is just some corner of a foreign field, but that's not the point. The field doesn't matter. What's important is the corners of all our hearts where the memories of the dead and what they achieved live on.    Justin Rowlatt's films on 30AU will be broadcast on The One Show on BBC One, 6 and 7 March, at 19:00 GMT    You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook

0062267787|5.0|Delirium Stories contains three short stories about the characters in the wonderful Delirium world.<br /><br />Annabel tells about Lena's mother and what happened to her before Delirium.  We get to see how she met Lena's father, her response to other people's cures, and how she rebelled and the days before escaping the Crypt.  None of this information is new or surprising, as it just tells what we found in Delirium.  But it is worth the read because we get to see inside Annabel's head and see where Lena got her strength and determination from.<br /><br />Hana tells about Lena's best friend. We get to see her attitude towards her match and her rebellion of sneaking out with a boy from school. She had been infected with amor deliria nervosa, but sees the painful side of love as she finds her feelings are not returned. Her world falls apart from fear of being discovered.  This story really fleshed Hana out for me and showed the reasons she did what she did in Delirium.<br /><br />Raven tells two parts of Raven's story, when she first ran away and when she had to save Lena and Julian. The chapters of the past tell when Raven ran away from her old life with the abandoned newborn she had found, and joined a group of rebels in the wild. That's when she met the other newcomer in the group, Tack. The story then goes on to tell about Raven and Tack's relationship.  The only problem I have with this novella was that it created more questions that should have been answered in Requiem, but weren't.<br /><br />Oliver's writing is as poetic and beautiful as ever in all three stories.  If you enjoyed Delirium, I highly suggest you read these novellas to accompany the trilogy.

0765325950|1.0|The rating is solely for this book, but the post includes material for the entire series.  With that said this book was easily the worst of the last three, it's not worth reading unless you are a Brandon Sanders fan.  If Robert Jordan (RJ) would have wrapped this series up in 10 or 11 books, instead of milking the series,  this could have been considered among the best of all  time for this genera.  If you ever read the series again and skip/skim the characters which do not truly deserve chapters devoted to them (Nynaeve, Elaine, and Egwene) you will find this a much easier read.  They make for great supporting characters, but with one exception, are unable to carry an interesting thread for any number of pages.  The one exception was Egwene's demoted role as Amerlyn, where she embraces the pain and tower battle ... that part was a classic read!  Do we really want to read hundreds of pages of drivel on girls/women trying to manipulate the main characters and each other, that and talk of clothing?  As long as the focus is on the three main characters (Rand, Mat, and Perrin) the book keeps moving and is a great read... well aside from these last two books.  A better author could have been selected, someone more fitting to RJ style.  Someone accurately wrote (in another review) that RJ wrote for everyone and Brandon Sanders (BS) writes for nerds.  And you can't have a truly great series when you're only writing for a small percentage of the population.  In my opinion BS is a sub-par writer, he shows flashes of brilliance, but then will go completely out of rhythm and create material like this book.  This final book, or a BS weak spot: an inability to apply different personalities to characters (they're all nerds, and the women do not seem like women);  main characters were not the focus;  Rand has no real part in this book;  two page chapters makes a choppy read with no depth;  600 + pages of battle was excessive and then repetitive; battle strategies were unrealisticor plain stupid; unplanned and unorganized; un-realistic parts and themes not consistent with earlier books; main themes where ignored or a rushed, and by rushed we mean taking a theme which ran 10 + books and ending it with a paragraph;  characters are no longer true to their original part;  mystery outcome for main characters, instead we get endless battle scenes and no plot!  Nothing is emotionally moving in this book, unless it's frustration in reading the material.  Earlier in the series i figured the Tinkers (and the lost song) would play a major role in the Dark Ones destruction... but it's not even mentioned.  A co-worker envisioned Padan Fain playing a roll similar to that of Gollum in Lord of the Rings, again this character is completely (almost) ignored.  The fact is that BS writes fluff material (no depth), and simply did not have the capacity to properly finish a series like this.  Some people say they read the book to find out the outcome, but for me the characters changed so much that they were no longer the same; hence it did not matter.  Mat and Nynaeve were  interesting characters when RJ wrote, but somewhere along the way with BS I stopped liking these characters.  In fact it was going that way for everything BS wrote about.  It's not too late to find another author to finish this book, but we need a writer who is attractive to all audiences.  And don't rush the output, people will always wait for quality, trashy material will NOT pass the test of time.  With a  quality three book ending to this series (removing the last 3 books), you could condense and make a truly epic movie.  As it stands now these ending books make the series sub-par and incomplete.  I actually liked BS first (joint-author role) addition to this series, but it was a down-hill slide from there.  If you are OK with the nerdish material, don't mind things being nonsensical, enjoy endless battles, or are a BS fan you will possibly like the book... read and enjoy.  The first few hundred pages were OK, but I found it very difficult to read this book to completion, skimmed much of it, almost tossed it in the garbage a few times, unsatisfied is an understatement.

He does not disappoint. Experimental yet sellable (reluctant using the word 'commercial' so not to scare off anyone), New, yet classic Bowie, Beautiful to a point that it's almost painful....get it? Classic Bowie. Love the places, love the lyrics, love the production...You will too. But am I correct? Is it really comparible to 'Low', 'Lodger', anything from the &#34;Berlin&#34; era? Well, it's 21st century Bowie for sure, But not another Heathen or Hours....good albums...but really modern...great albums...but really forward thinking....Thanks for not moving too far ahead Mr. Bowie and bringing back a taste of the good ol days....yet still keeping progressive. Love It! Master of Balance. Am I just ecstatic cause it's the first Bowie album in 10 years? Possibly..but aren't you, Bowie-fan? Hope you all enjoy it as much as I am enjoying it right this minute.

B00AFROVQC|1.0|First off, I received this book free from Google Play for my mobile device.<br /><br />The story line was interesting enough to download, but that's where it ends. I found that it used every element that has been passed down through time: young poor boy, mystical powers, evil queen, brave knights, beautiful princess, doomed love affair, and last but not least, betrayal of the royal family!!<br /><br />It's like the author took parts of other successful books and combined them into one story.  The problem with that is you already know how the book ends upon the first few chapters.  \\"Well I'll keep reading to see if there is a twist.\\" I told myself.  480 pages later, nope, no twist.  If I didn't get it for free I would have asked for my money back.  I think the money she saved in hiring an editor, she paid to the people giving reviews.<br /><br />As a Sixth Grade teacher, I've had better writing come in for a homework assignment on the solar system.  With this being book #1 in a series, he must be fighting GIANTS in the end, because everything is the most feared and largest beast he has ever seen... EVER!<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this book to anyone.  There are far better stories out there to explore.  Even when trying to engage my students to get into reading, this isn't a book for younger readers, too many grammar errors and the author tends to tell you the emotions for the characters rather than let the readers discover it for themselves.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Amazing docomentary. Excellent music. But above all, a chronicle of how music, ignored in the usa, became an inspiration to south africans and maybe helped ignite revolution ovet the apartheid.

I believe kids of most ages may love it for its characters, actions and events. Judging it from an adult viewpoint and comparing it to stories like &#34;Tangled&#34; or &#34;Brave&#34;  this falls short for a story line. In fairness, I like lizards and enjoyed the character Rango as well as some of the others - but not enough to earn their 4 or 5 star rating.

B00A77II0U|5.0|This was by far one of the BEST ho games I have played. Great graphics and story line. Twists &amp; turns with a bit of confusion, which kept this game challenging, yet so fun! WARNING: VERY ADDICTING!! Couldn't stop playing, hours would pass by so quickly. Very engaging game, I HIGHLY recommend it!!  Thanks, would like to see more like it! Worth every penny! Excellent A+++++
B006LSZECO|4.0|I generally liked reading the book, but I did not like the ending.i would recommend the book as easy reading.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book,  I have read most of Vince Flynnj and they never disappoint.  Lots of action and looking forward to his next book.
B0073CCYAM|3.0|Like a previous reviewer, I was expecting something a bit larger.  It is much smaller than the Mattel diecast Cars, probably similar in scale to a Hot Wheels car.  It appears to be nicely made with good detail, and it was shipped promptly.  But, I am giving the seller only 3 stars for lack of appropriate information in the product description.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It is one of those books that you cannot put down...<br />It is definitely a good buy!!!!<br />After reading this you have got to get the third book of the series.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Eagerly editing for another Tin Tin adventure. Great fast paced action adventure movie that everyone can enjoy. Must watch at least once.
B0026P3G12|5.0|The cd is wonderful. Susan's voice and her songs are beautiful, l listen to her sing all of the time. Thank you.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Seems like everyone is playing this game. Probably the most<br />popular bingo game out there, many add twists and turns.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I thought I would try this game out since it had such high ratings but I was very disappointed.  Gameplay was fine and graphics are good but I got bored real quick.  And scary?... no.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's ok, but on small kindle screen not easy to see. Hidden object game is<br />good but better played on a large monitor.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game has awesome graphics. It's an easy game that progressively gets a little harder during each competition. The only thing I don't like is getting bombarded by ads (it is a free game after all). Sometimes game play gets a little choppy but overall a very good game.
B0025YKDJC|3.0|It was enjoyable had some really funny parts, but not necessarily Carrey at his best. It had a good supporting cast and the girl was great. I would probably watch it again to see if i missed anything.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I read this book too fast. I loved how her thoughts wandered. It is funny that she writes the way peoples brains work. We just keep it to ourselves & Ellen tells it. She is hilarious & it is so easy to read, I enjoyed that I could read this book & relax! This is something I'll read again.
B005MJDJQQ|1.0|This book is pretty gory and little more violence that I like.  His other books have not caused me to feel this way.  I think I will take a break from Wallander for awhile.
159562015X|4.0|I bought this as a christmas gift, I took the quiz and it was super helpful.  It makes for a useful tool for others.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|The book left me wanting more.  Many of the questions were answered about David's mother, but more questions about Fermin? Who was/is this guy?  Can't wait until the next experience from Carlos Zafon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awsome I like it cause it is fun I think everyone should play it and try it
B003JTHXOK|1.0|When you can read only one sentence per page and still keep up with the plot (?) you know its not a good book. This theme has been played over and over.  I thought I was watching Julia Roberts in &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34;.  I did enjoy &#34;The Notebook&#34; and thought I might like this because the town in the book was Southport which I know very well. The characters were totally unbelievable....maybe that's why some were g..h..o...s..t!!!!!!!!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I really enjoy the BBC New App).  I find it a great way to close out the day by clicking on the app to get the latest International, as well as the US news, along with the latest technology news.  Due to the WiFi connection I can view the news in my bedroom after my computer has been put to bed.  It' a great service to be able to keep up with world events in real time.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It won't take you very long to find out. Does what you would expect it to. Quick, easy - what more could you ask?
B00B935SUY|5.0|Great movie. Really informational. You could tell Dave grohl is passionate about music. Loved it. Loved the Paul McCartney part.
B004XQYBA2|3.0|I always start a new program off with the easiest of quests. Wow! Most of the puzzles in the &#34;easy&#34; ranks compare to 'upper intermediate&#34; anywhere else. I have been able to solve about 40% of what I've tried. Haven't ventured to the higher levels.<br />If you are looking for a good, challenging Sudoko to go head to head with you have definitely found it!
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I loved it, the product arrived early, without a mark on it, and it was packaged correctly which I loved as well.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|I couldn't find the resemblance to anything Mahjong! Not intuitive at all. May be something about Mahjong that I don't understand, but I would be hard pressed to think about suggesting it to any one.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I loved it, the product arrived early, without a mark on it, and it was packaged correctly which I loved as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A friend of mine showed me this program some time ago on his iPhone and when I got my Kindle Fire HD for Christmas I immediately started looking for it. I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't available for the Kindle! Had the same problem with my Android phone. Then I got an email a couple of weeks ago that suggested I try again. Voila! There it was! I am very pleased with it and have not seen anything that even comes close to it . I know it still has other things I can do with it but I haven't gotten past my ability to pick different versions to read!<br />If the Bible is your book then YouVersion is for you!
B000065V3H|5.0|I loved it, the product arrived early, without a mark on it, and it was packaged correctly which I loved as well.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Yo recomendaría el libro a niños de 10 - 16 es muy interesante el libro : esta opinión la hizo un niño de 10 años
0789310627|5.0|My son is possibly the youngest anglophile ever.  And we are planning a trip to England, I had seen this book on Land of Nod website, but didn't purchase it because I would rather get a good bargain.  I bought it on Amazon, great deal.  And I loved the book.  Yes, it is a bit old, well, classic.  I loved that in the back it has updated information.  Not only did my son love it and it gave us some great ideas of places to visit while we are there; but his grandparents who lived in England and travel back every few years were impressed by the book.  I want to get the entire collection of \\"This Is\\" books.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|I love all of these books! Robin Hobb is a fantastic writer, I enjoy escaping into the stories. The chacacters are well developed and I miss them when I finish with the books.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have tried all the popular weather apps for my Kindle Fire HD and always end up back to AccuWeather. Give it a try. This app is 100% CapeCodMediaKing Approved.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I heard about this game from a friend and decided to give it a try I love playing it. It's so much fun. And such a challenge
1616550414|4.0|This book is a must have for all Zelda fans, point blank. While majority is Skyward Sword art and plot, many seem to not realize that in the beginning much of this was probably never thought to take off as much as it did. So while we have some from before Ocarina of Time they really seemed to focus on the games people really will recognize which is good. I'd much rather look at the artwork for Ocarina of Time onward since that would require much more work in the art department than (No offence older games I think you're awesome as well) Link to the Past and back.<br /><br />The manga in the back was one of my main attractants and finally completed my Legend of Zelda Manga series (Squee).<br />While the book could have contained quite a bit of information about the story lines connecting the games better, I think that there is enough for people to get a taste and let them develop their own Theories as well as diminish old ones (Cough timeline). The art is enough that you could call this \\"Legend of Zelda: The Art Book\\" but what else could they put in? Fan Theories?<br /><br />This book is quite popular and a strong piece in the Zelda fan's department. Since it's so popular you might expect it to be late, though a few months from release it may of diminished but my book was late due to lack of books... even when preordered. But this book is worth the wait. Definitely recommended to anyone who's interested in Zelda.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its impossible to put down my kindle I think this is one of the greatest games yet or even created! if ur not sure to get im telling you that u should download it right now
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good Read,author gives first hand accounts of what it must be like to fight terror on a daily basis. One gets a close feel for life in these war torn countries.
B006O6F932|5.0|Granddaughter Christmas gift again...she can't get enough of the Monster High stuff...she loves it and all the dolls she got as well.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was a fairly good read with interesting twists and turns - a few surprises. The ending was a complete flop!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but the only issue I have is once I start playing I can't put it down .
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this &#34;omnibus&#34; mostly because it was inexpensive and in a genre I enjoy. It didn't take me long to realize I'd made a really good decision. It is rare that I talk about my ever-streaming series of novels to my husband but this one made me want to talk. I had to tell him all about the world the characters found themselves in, how pleased I was by the premise, the strong female lead, the challenges. I got really into it. I will be adding this author to my watch list.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought one after reading countless reviews and thought I'd go ahead with this one given its great price against competitors. After a month of using it and liking it, the inner zip broke. I contacted Amazon about it, sent it back and they promptly replaced it with a new one. Was very impressed with their quick reply and action. Overall, I like this Diono organizer. I find the inner zip is what I use the most, great for a job and I need a discreet place to keep keys and change. I'm using it with a Citi Mini stroller and it works awesome.
1419707671|4.0|My 9 year old loves these books.  He was very excited to get this set for his birthday. Good way to help him stay interested in reading.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a very good app about the Holy Bible.  It is alot to this app, it contains alot of information.  It is alot of different studies that you can do with this app.  It covers the Bible in great detail, it takes into account the entire Bible and it is a great resource.  I am still learning things about this app and information that is in it.  It is a great download to have, it is also a great study Bible.  I do recommend this to my friends.  Download this app, you will enjoy it.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|We love it, and have made so many perfect glasses. But, just like some previous reviews recommended, I watched the You Tube video after my husband had broken several using the tapper to separate the bottle. I keep a big pot of boiling water and stand over the kitchen sink. I alternate running cold tap water right on the score line-- while rotating the bottle, then poring the boiling water out of a measuring cup on the score line. You will see the temperature differences change the score line into a break and, after several rotations of hot and cold-- it will separate all by itself.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like solitaire, and I like playing this one on my Kindle better than on my computer.  This game is so fun you can change the card faces, there are different deals, and change the way you do the draw.  You can set the game many different ways.  This game will also stimulate your mind and make you think about your next move. I really enjoy playing this game.  I will also recommend this to a friend.  Download the app you will enjoy the game.
B005721Y7Y|3.0|The acting and the general story line in the movie is very good.<br /><br />I was revulsed by Hollywood's normal propeganda.  I.e.  Someone who enjoys firearms = crazy person = Nazi lover (owner of authentic Nazi plate) equal U.S. Marine.<br /><br />Additionally, Marines, in gereral, are conservative.  Nazis were extreme leftists who believed in government control of every aspect of life.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I was expecting a conventional high school, coming-of-age story. I was surprised to find something much deeper and much more emotional. This is perhaps my favorite movie of all time because of how it speaks to my heart. Isn't that what art is all about?
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I got my item on time and it works great. I'm happy with the price and everything. I would suggest this movie to anyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Can't go wrong with Nicholas Sparks.  I could picture everything in my mind when I was reading the book and it brought up emotions but when I went to the movie it was a poor substitute.  If I hadn't read the book first, I wouldn't have known what was going on and the book was so much more detailed and interwoven like a quilt.  The revelation regarding the spirit of his deceased wife coming right at the end of the book was so unexpected and the cherry on top!  The detail of her cop husband's attempts to find her with his sick mind was so much better in the book.  The way the neighbor let the cat out of the bag without knowing it added the necessary excitement of the reader knowing he was going to find her but when and how?  My chores had to wait until I finished it.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I'm a huge fan of McFarlane and heard the movie was very funny but I was a little disappointed.  Definitely some good laughs but left me wanting more.
B002F3BOSM|1.0|This album needs no introduction, as it was one of the best selling of the late Sixties and early Seventies. Most people who would be looking at this item are interested in this new, 180 gram vinyl reissue for audiophiles, and here, this record is a major disappointment.<br /><br />To begin with, the midrange and higher frequencies are very muffled; it's almost as if there is no sonic information at all above, say, 1500 Hz. Then there's the mushy, almost soggy bottom end that should extend well below ordinary bass levels, but, no, there are times when I am thinking that I am hearing this record on a 1960s jukebox with some blown out speakers instead of a high-quality home audio system. And then there's the closed-in image and sound stage that confine the music to a small rectangle between the speakers -- not wide and spacious as it is on the recently-released Audio-Fidelity branded gold CD [[ASIN:B005V4X8JA Crosby, Stills & Nash]].<br /><br />That would be a far better choice for ardent fans of this music, and the cost is not much more than this dismal vinyl LP.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My girls nine and ten years old both loved this movie. I watched most of it with them. It also had some good clean adult humour to keep me coming back.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This app is not that fun. I prefer the original one. It is a lot more fun and you don't have weird things like ropes and things. I wouldn't play this app if it was the last app on earth.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|great case for a great price.. has saved me multiple times already.  I ahve seen them for 3x the price at other online sites.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Loved the book more than &#34;The War of Art&#34;.<br />If you have a project in mind that you want to do and you want to keep resistance from getting in your way, this book is the one to read. It describes the ways in which resistance can manifest at the beginning of your work, in the middle, before the finish... So you can recognise it for what it is and keep going.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I played the Brave edition first. This is much more challenging. The moreadvanced graphics lend to the difficulty bythrowing you off your stride. In any event, this is a really good game.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|If you liked the movie this is a great way to relive it. I enjoy listening to this when I really want something I can sing along to but is \\"different.\\" Probably a little annoying if you didn't see the movie.
B0068THAGY|4.0|It wasn't an academy award winner by any stretch but it was very entertaining. Enough laughs, scares, romance, and intrigue to keep it rolling. Classic Spielberg.
B008JOLG7U|5.0|I love the all songs from this album and I got it for a GREAT deal. The collaborations are fantastic.
B003Y5H542|1.0|The only good movies that he has made was the Pirates series!!!!!!! This movie was simply pathetic. I couldn't even finish it! It is slow and boring, and predictable.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Even though Kristen Stewart singlehandedly ruined the Twilight movies (ok, she got better as it went on) the music compilation on these movies are INCREDIBLE!
B00A4GXJD0|1.0|Kid Rock is AWESOME! However the last two CDs have been garbage. I'm glad I listened to the CD before I purchased it. So glad I didn't waste my money on this trash. Needs to go back to Devil and C ocky
034580404X|5.0|I have not read this, as it was a gift for my wife. She loves it. The books arrived fast, with no problems.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I love this movie.  I think this was a great purchase.  I liked the book better but the movie was still great. I watch it at least twice a month.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Overall good movie!  My wife and I found humor into some of the decision making that went on.  I agree with one reviewer, if you see an alien snake you don't try to pet it.  The first 30 minutes seemed dry and made me sleepy but the remaining part kept me into the movie.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I loved this movie & loved the villian most of all.  You can see Javier Bardem really put a lot of effort into being a great Bond villian.  When he pulled his jaw out of his mouth that was weird.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great fun and great challenges. Does not require lot of thinking. Anyone any age can play. Can play for hours.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Ruth Ozeki's book is truly deserving of awe, as in the real sense of overwhelming wonder.  Writing as a 16 year old girl contemplating suicide is fiendishly difficult to achieve without falling into the precious or the realm of young adult angst.  Certainly this book reminds me that 16 year olds exist in time experiencing the steering uncertainty of time and and adulthood.  Nao's journal and the story of her Buddhist nun aunt cross the ocean from Japan to end in the hands of Ruth, who is facing her own bleakness.  Nao addresses the reader as the being meant to receive the message.  Ruth finds herself loathe to disagree.<br /><br />This lovingly philosophical novel is layered with quantum physics, Zen Buddhism, and magical reality.  Almost casually, the reader is offered pearls of riffs on time and the Japanese meaning of suicide as the only mastering of life.  Ruth bears her name as derived from Middle English for rue while missing the Hebrew root meaning grace, certainly more pertinent to this lovely character.  We share her quest to find the remarkable Nao, hoping to find her alive.  And winding through the whole are strands of Japanese culture at its most compelling.  Nao, who shares the same meme as English now proves that to grasp the now is to find it slipped to then.<br /><br />This is a book to savor, to wish for the existence of a sixth star, to share, and to read.  This author has illustrated beautifully my deep belief is the true meaning of human telepathy.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|I stayed home sick from work on day and decided to watch this movie. My adventure of sitting on the couch was not nearly as fulfilling as Ferris's. Overall, this was a very funny movie.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Easy read, typical twists and turns of a good Nicholas Sparks romance. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, wish I finished it before the movie came out because couldn't stop picturing the characters looking like Josh Duhamel and Ryan Seacrests girlfriend. Not who I had in mind before the movie previews.
B0011EBDE6|5.0|What a brilliant film.  Collaborative communication is a concept the world could use & be a better place IMHO.  The movie is not one you can watch only once to understand it.  It needs to be watched several times.  I still haven't figured out the purpose of the businessman character played by Bill Murray.  There is a scene with a young boy is holding a pistol…  I won't give the plot away, but that too adds a factor that makes the movie so interesting to me.  A definite 5 star film & one you can watch over and over without being put to sleep.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Couldn't put it down.The characters are real people. Society still stigmatizes mental illness as a choice of lifestyle, rather than a medical issue. Matthew Quick treats it with respect and sensitivity, as well as great humor. I loved it.
B0091VZLOY|4.0|One of my all time favorites.  Only movie in which Ashton Kutcher is a good actor, worthy of being called an actor.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though you know the ending, the suspense of them finally getting away is edge of the seat entertaining. Wonderful acting, and Affleck continues to prove that he's an excellent actor AND Director. Rent it for a great night of entertainment.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I have read the majority of Nicholas Sparks books and have never been able to say I was disappointed in any of them until now.This book was so predictable that I felt like I was reading second-hand material that had been passed down from someone else. I just finished an excellent book from a first time author called \\"Angels of Hells Canyon: The Journal\\" and can honestly say I had the same feelings I experienced from Nicholas Sparks first book, \\"The Notebook.\\" Hopefully, Mr. Sparks you have not lost your freshness and uniquity and \\"Safe Haven\\" turns out to be an exception to the rule.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|While this is a great dvd for those people that LOVE GNR like myself and love the GNR videos from back in the day. I think the only real problem is that the dvd is missing a couple of great videos and the first that comes to mind is \\"You could be mine\\" from the movie T2 and then their is the video that never got air played called \\"Its so easy\\" which you can find on Youtube if you look hard enough. I think that if they added those and maybe any other videos that might have been missed that maybe people might not remeber would cool. So even though those 2 are missing from this dvd I still give it a 5 star rating cause to me this is a great dvd for those fans like myself that love the videos. If you are a fan and wanted more for the money that you spend on this dvd then this dvd is not for you then but to me I am very happy with this purchase and I think anyone else would be too if they just want the videos and nothing else to keep it nice and simple.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|&#34;Flight&#34; has the most intense crash scene since Tom Hank's &#34;Cast Away.&#34;  The CG effects are absolutely amazing. After the crash the movie develops the characters and focuses on pilot Denzil Washington's inner struggles as an alcoholic and his growth from denial to integrity. It's not the best movie you'll ever see but it is certainly worth an evening of your time.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is fun and somewhat challenging. The only downfalls to the  game is that you have to spend too much real money or spend forever waiting to level up to get diamonds to buy extras to get through rooms and challenges. When you do level up and get diamonds it's still not enough sometimes. Other than that it's pretty good.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Girl Gone was much better.  Although the format was about the same, it just didn't compare to her other book.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|When this movie came out I was too busy caring for a new baby boy, life happened I guess. 12 years later I finally saw all three mivies back to back. I loved it. Can't wait for The Hobbit to come out on DVD.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great series. It's as if you get attached with the characters and feel their emotions. Can't wait for the movies!
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|It is okay , maybe a little awkward for most kids under 12. It just felt as if it was a rehash of prior works of this kind , and a bit over reaching.
0596804822|3.0|There is some great and well-rounded graphics programming content in this book, but it also has several significant errors in formulas that will bring your learning to a grinding halt until you realize that it's not you, it's the book. Several of these errors are listed on the book's errata page at the publisher's website, but strangely some of the most significant are not in the \\"confirmed\\" section of that website despite many people logging the issues. Two very important errors are the matrix formula for one of the function's in the book's appendix, a function which is required for every example in the book yet will not work until the function is corrected, and also some of the animation formulas (the linear tween formulas has the start and end points completely reversed which will give you animations in the opposite direction than you intend!!).<br /><br />Aside from this very major issues that every single reader must know about BEFORE beginning their learning, the book is written by a genuine graphics expert of the highest caliber, even if it seems that perhaps some of it must have been written or edited quite quickly to allow for such problems.<br /><br />The most significant criticism of the book's strategy is that requirement that you MUST know C++ if you are going to get anything out of this book. Yet, the book's title clearly indicated \\"Iphone programming\\" of which C++ is certainly not the native or required language of that device. Nearly none of the major creative programming in this book is handled in Objective-C and this only makes a difficult topic even more difficult for iphone programmers.ad the relevant sections in this book, you'll find it was pretty thoroughly explained here all along, just not always in the most \\"dumbed down\\" fashion for a complete novice to grasp.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Fun movie , good voices to match the characters being portrayed , a lot of fun for any viewing audience.
B005V7UW3W|5.0|My daughter has been a fan of The Gilmore Girls for many years and was re-viewing them as she could on the On Demand service.  This set of all seasons was just what she wanted and made her Valentine's Day a great success!
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I love this app, its well developed and has so many puzzles! If you're a sudoku fanatic this is a must have.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I loved this when it came on TV and having the set with the extra features is quite special.  I would recommend this to any history buff whether you are a WWII fanatic or not.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewels Star is very addicting. I love it I find myself playing it when I have a spare moment. Just love it!!!!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I remember reading it many years ago. Got it on my Kindle and couldn't put it down. Follows the events leading up to Halo 1 and gives detailed information on the Chief and the rest of the Spartan II's.
B009K0P10K|5.0|can't wait for more episodes to come,has been very addicting to watch<br />Hope she get what she want's  good show!!!!
630471193X|5.0|It was in top notch condition. My husband loved it for Valentine's Day. It's one of his favorite movies. Thank you for making his day very special.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Not a die hard Britney fan but absolutely love this record. There's just something about it. Every song is unique. Leaving its own  beat signature in your head way after you turn off the music but not obnoxiously so. I say give it a chance. Listen to it three or four times and it will become one of your favorites if you like the current dance music scene. This record definitely did not get it's due. She easily had 3 more singles off this record if given the chance.
B0067LXQAW|4.0|I like the Cranberries and used to listen to them all the time in the '90's, so I liked this CD, too. But i'M more fond of the songs I grew up with back then from them.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this book. Independent, smart and confident female character definitely make a love novel more intriguing.<br />'
B00821OUT6|5.0|Good to see Noah Wyle back at it again. After his wonderful role in \\"The Librarian\\" movies who knew what he would be doing next. His role in this Scifi series, of course, is much different than previous roles. Its a unique, exciting, and incredible tale of adventure! I look forward to the third season...and many many more. Hopefully!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show is amazing! I have litterally sat down and watched this show from begining to end...a FEW times :) couldnt make a better show!!!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|this app is so amazing. it lets you express art in so many different ways. and surprisingly it is free!!!
B002KKCVY6|5.0|This is my second pair in 6 months!<br />Arch support; side support; fit like a glove; comfortable all day; dry quickly after wet; and true fit (I have a 13W), these are great sandals.<br />WHy a second pair?<br />Because I wanted to add a different color to my arsenal of casual footwear...
B0053O89WY|1.0|One disc was moving around inside the package when we received it.  Causes viewing problem.  Wasn't in original plastic wrap packaging.  Stay away!
B00846REIS|5.0|I'm so totally fulfilled by this book. Sylvia day must be a genius in relationships. Great read and the passion high.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is most likely the third time I have read this book and I love the Hunger Games. It's an amazing series and its just so descriptive. I would recommend reading this book, although it may be violent for some. I have read all of them and its just a really great series. I would recommend to read the books before watching the movies because the books add the best details and it gives a fabulous image.
B009FZFONO|5.0|You can take it r leave it the genre is not for everyone. My husband and I only watched one show last year and did not get all the fuss over the show. When it returned this year with much fanfare we decided to watch from the state and are glad we did. We are seriously hooked! If you have missed out and don't mind some gore then watch the complete series. You may find you like it too.
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|I didn't realize that you had to use your fingers to write the notes. I would probably be fine if I had a small stylus to use.
B0058SNJBG|5.0|written on my husbands acct:I like the shoes but had to return because they were too small. I wear a 4 and ordered a 4.  Had to exchange for a 5.  Haven't received the 5 yet to see how the fit is.<br />RECEIVED the size 5 which at first thought were a bit big but I wore them for a day and now<br />find they are perfect.  I love them, they are so comfortable.  My sister got the first pair and won't use any other shoe now, she loves them so much. They are great to walk in all day. I'm going to order black next.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Still no disappointments.  John Scalzi has developed an entirely believable future universe and society.  He is a master at developing the political plot without making it so burdensome that I wanted to watch the news instead of reading the book.  Another fast gripping story.  It's on to his next book for me.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|Tim Burton at his wacky, quirky best!!!  I have been wanting this movie for a while and I finally decided to get it!!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This was my first experience with John Scalzi's writing, so I didn't really know what to expect.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  It was an extremely fast read.  I literally could not put the book down.  John developed the characters very quickly, which allowed the story to just flow off the pages.  There was just enough description to properly set the scenes without over burdening the reader with non-essentials.  If you want a good, light, fast read, then John Scalzi is your go-to guy.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Proof of Heaven is a scientific approach to understanding our brain in an altered state of consciousness.  Certainly made me consider the possibilities...
B00B7FW6U4|4.0|If you liked the other Paranormal Activity movies you should like this one,  I still can't get used to the floating camera movies but I still watch them.. Good Saturday night fright flick, bundle up with some popcorn..:)
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Kay Scarpetta is an engaging character who genuinely wrestles with the issues of approaching middle age where her actions and her reactions to the people around her take on new meanings.  This underlying subplot is effectively woven into the main story in a way that strengthens both.  As to setting the stage for yet another story, enter Dr. Luke Zenner.  There is something not quite right about this one.  I believe he will cross one or more lines in the future and intentionally create problems for Kay in both her personal and professional lives.  I will continue to follow Dr. Scarpetta's career to see what happens next.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|Did the job that I wanted it to do, simply to clean up the desk space a little.<br /><br />I have a 24 inch viewsonic on this mounting arm.<br /><br />Its the weight that is important not the size of the monitor. All of the led / flat screens now are very light weight.<br /><br />I gave it 4 out of 5 because it lacks angles of moving it around.<br /><br />But its worth every penny for what it is, very well constructed ERGOTRON.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|This is an amazing collaboration of artists! I have great respect for Dave Grohl and for many of these artists (Stevie Nicks, especially!) This collection of songs varies in style and will not disappoint.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it. Keeps me from missing my horse so bad.  Reminds me how much work they can be and lets me disconnect from the real world for a minute.
B002ZG976U|5.0|To bad my DVD could not read it and I had to send it back. But I bought 5 others and the same thing happened not sure why its just this movie.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this app is so much fun and is VERY addicting and great for kids its just like mario and even if you dont like mario this app could still be for you
B00275EGX8|5.0|Great movie with the right mix of a little bit of action, suspense, and drama  to keep it interesting. Well worth it.
0307592731|4.0|Wild is the story of a troubled young woman who, over a period of several months during the summer of 1995, trekked an 1,100 mile portion of the Pacific Coast Trail in order to try to find herself. An aspiring writer even then, she chronicled her three month journey, in order, no doubt, to transform it into publishable form one day. She starts by recounting events surrounding her mother's cancer diagnosis, treatment and way too early death (at age 45), at which time Ms. Strayed (a surname she dreamed up during her divorce) was only 22 years old. Trying to pick up the pieces afterwards, deal with her mother's death, her stepfather moving on to a new relationship and her siblings' disconnectedness, she makes several significant and very poor choices in her own life involving infidelity and drug use. \\"Judge not lest ye be judged\\" and all that, but the fact that she could describe her husband at the time as such a loving, caring person, but still choose to cheat on him repeatedly was a little incredible. And while I'm on the subject, I might as well list other moments that left me feeling similarly surprised: kicking a heroin habit without outside assistance; shaking that guy's hand in spite of what she'd just done with it; bringing me to tears with an emotional, heart-wrenching story of putting an old horse down, yet covering a decision that has potentially huge future ramifications in a quick couple of sentences (p 57), \\"I [spoiler omitted] and learned how to make dehydrated tuna flakes and turkey jerky...;\\" and her description of that super suspenseful, scary encounter that began about page 283. In spite of all that and the fact that she is now benefitting from the bad behavior that compelled her to attempt this journey in the first place, I found Ms. Strayed's story extremely engaging, especially her descriptions of her travels along the PCT. The way she tells her tale of the trail (which, we should all remember, took place over 15 years ago) transported me to her world as much as her bravery and dedication inspired me. Best of the book: many years have passed since the trip, yet the author tells it in the proper (mid-twenties-year-old-woman) tone and voice, which makes readers feel like she just stepped off the path, sat down immediately, and began recounting her amazing adventure. Also good: Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen by Christopher McDougall; Even Silence Has an End by Ingrid Betancourt and Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert.orld as much as her bravery and dedication inspired me.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't know what it is about Zombies, but they certainly stir some kind of primordial awakening in the psyche.  I am not a slasher film fan, but I love a good scary movie… you know, the “things that go bump in the night” kind of fan.  And I love this show!  The violence may be the backdrop, but the survival aspect of this series is what draws me.  What has made it even better are the characters.  The Walking Dead directors and producers have done a first-rate job drawing the audience in so that your main concern is finding out in the next episode that “the group” is okay.  All are heroes in their own way, but all are flawed and just do the best that they can in the worst possible scenario imaginable.  Just when you think things couldn’t get worse, the 3rd season takes you deeper into hellish territory.  But in every episode, you find humanity still hangs on… even if just by a fleshy tendon.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Accurate portrayal of a semi-functional alcoholic in a pilots uniform. Relationships in his life are explored and emphasized as well as the nature of alcoholism; all against the backdrop of the airline industry. It is also a story of redemption.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i think u should add railroad tracks and fire it may make your game more popular and fun.<br /> but i loved the update.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|This was a wonderful movie that made you laugh and smile :) Thought it was more serious, but more of a comedy!<br />I would see it again, it was that good!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game for any tablet and is a great game for young kid or like me a twelve year old hope you enjoy this free game
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have seen Band of Brothers once before on TV but I really like this mini series and enjoyed watching it again. I do really like the bonus material this DVD set offers.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is truly a fun game and fun for all ages. It passes the time and it can be quite challenging.
B002VX0A40|5.0|She smiles every time she sees her dragons toothy grin. She likes her Sir Prance a Lot, and the Peacock, too, but the Owl wasn't impressive, apparently.  Lamaze toys are the best!
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|It  didn't do what I thought it was going to do. Hopefully, it will come in handy down the road.
B0074EIQUG|4.0|4 song were great and several were good and then what i did not really care for but the joy of owning an artists collection is that all may change...?!!
1451696191|4.0|The packaging and were a little worn out, and torn up, but the book was worth it! I loved it.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I thought i was ordering the entire first season but from what i thought happened i paid and got the first show of the first season only not the entire season? I love the show and cast but the complete first season i did not watch
B0089BSM70|5.0|While Halloween II isn't as good as Carpenter's original, this is still a really effective flick and leagues beyond any of the other original sequels or the Rob Zombie reboot series. It's an atmospheric little film that still manages to retain the feel of the original, even as it devolves into slasher movie madness by upping the kill count from the first and spills even more blood this time around. Michael Myers is still as frightening as he was and maybe even more so. The hospital setting is great, providing a genuinely scary and memorable location for the bulk of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are great as well, reprising their roles from the original films.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray edition of the film gets high marks due to Scream Factory's treatment of the film, providing a beautiful transfer of the film along with worthwhile extras. It's really nice to see a film like this get treated with respect, even if it's just a B-movie horror flick. There are a couple of nice behind the scenes extras produced exclusively for this disc that are full of interesting background info on  the production of Halloween II and it's fun to hear the recollections of many of the original cast (except for Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter who aren't here but the other participants more than make up for it) more than thirty years after the film's release.<br /><br />Also packaged is the television cut of the film which is a good thing for purists. Highly recommended for horror buffs. Keep an eye out for Scream Factory, as they've been putting out quite a line up of classic horror films as of late.
1401216676|5.0|I loved it. Since most of the originals are out. This hardcore book is great. My boyfriend loved it and is no addicted to these comics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best running game i have ever played in my life .i run and<br />Slide and jump also bord with power ups
B003G94BZC|5.0|Great continuation of the Dr. Who series.  Really enjoy Matt Smith's portrayal of the doctor.  Lot's of excellent new material.  The cgi is excellent.<br /> Would love to meet Professor River Song.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it so awesome I beat all my friends on facebook. now I plan on beating my family before they beat me wish me luck and my family too............if you like this game put it on facebook if you have one anyway
1616550414|5.0|the item is worth it for zelda fans. the book was impecable when arrived, there wasn't any missprint of anykind.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is so addicting, i love it. This show is packed with action, horrors, thrill and some romance.  Great show.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I liked Game of Thrones and made the mistake of reading it during the school week instead of on the weekend. My homework definitely got procrastinated on.<br /><br />I'm very impressed with George Martin's world building. I could really feel all the characters, their countries, and their cultures coming to life. The way he wrote women was also impressive. It's almost impossible for me to find likable female characters but aside from &#34;The Lannister Woman&#34; (can't remember her name...) and Sansa I liked the rest of the characters in the book.<br /><br />Gave it 4 stars because I felt some parts got rather long winded
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked Fifty Shades, you'll love this!  Cute, rich guy that falls for the uninterested girl - a must read!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|As usual, the Brits know how to produce a superb theatrical series. Owning the first two seasons of Downton Abbey can only prolong the enjoyment and allow for repeated, visual visits. Season 3 can't come too soon!
B004S5FW1U|4.0|A very entertaining and easy read. I haven't seen the movie, so no idea how it compares.<br />Pat's inability to remember the past or face up to reality is a compelling device that propels the narrative forward. His character provides frightening, sad and really funny moments.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|I have loved the James Bond Series since I was a young boy. This was in my opinion the true James Bond. This book may not be completely politically correct but you must take in to consideration when this book was written. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a thriller or some ole fashioned cloak & dagger.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|This is absolutely the most fun one can have watching a TV show. I recomend Dr. Who for the whole family
B0071XO8RA|5.0|good charatcer development, vivid imagery.  I have read the sequel and am now waiting for the next instalment. Hopefully next month.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|This is absolutely the most fun one can have watching a TV show. I recomend Dr. Who for the whole family
B000I8G5B2|2.0|the movie was ok,,had to watch it for school and had to order on amazon for 10.00 which was a lot to watch it but could not find it anywhere else
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was a face-paced,entertaining read.  If you enjoyed Gone Girl, you'll probably like this one even better.  But be prepared to read it in one sitting - I couldn't put it down.
B0025CS2GU|1.0|The storyline line was weak as was the characters. Very poor acting.<br />I ordered this movie for my 13 year old who wanted to see it desperately. 15 minutes into watching it  he said, \\"this is such a dumb movie\\".
B007THA4FI|5.0|Her characters and plot were interesting and  really drew me in - just like the Harry Potter story.  This one was pretty tragic though.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Anyone who has read Preston and Child will like this book. The mix of scenarios and how they all come together make it an interesting read. Kept me intrigued.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Even for our tween kids, the movie was entertaining and fun! It made for a great family night together on the couch.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is one of those games that is endless and lots of fun....especially to pass the time if you are bored with nothing to do. By the time you realize 2hours has passed by.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Bon Javi is to American soft rock what Obama is to the U.S. economy: They both could do a whole lot better, homes! However, that's beside the point because I've always been a hardcore Bon Javi fan when I could appreciate them for what they always were: a straight-ahead soft rock outfit that p/o/o/p/ed out emo power ballad after emo power ballad, way before emo was even smoking, yo!<br /><br />Man, I have nothing but great memories of listening to Bon Javi power ballad after power ballad back in the day, usually while holding my lighter aloft and running my still-greasy hands through my recently blow-dried big hair. I'm so happy that Jan, Ricardo Sambora, Davey and Taco Torres all went back to their pop-ballad roots for this CD. It brought back so many awesome memories for me that I literally...literally almost remembered again how mediocre this band was. Literally.<br /><br />Take Amen, for instance. It's basically a homage to the Roman Catholic Church, set to Ricardo's trademark guitar plucking and Jan's trademark pretty-boy vocals. It made me want to start living on a prayer, lemme tell ya. Or how about With These Two Hands? Here, you get Davey's sweet keyboard chopstick sounds along with more of Ricardo's guitar playing that features feedback so low you can barely make it out. But that's aight because that's the whole Bon Javi sound that I absolutely loooove to death.<br /><br />Folks, I mean, fellow Bon Javi fans, I can spend literally...literally a few more seconds telling you about how great this comeback CD is, but why bother? You'll just have to listen to it yourself, so I recommend that you buy this right now from Amazon, although you may not have any savings anymore since you're probably among the underemployed in Obama's America. Still, buy this CD! Now.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Lights was a better album, but Halcyon is still well worth the listen. I still give both 5 stars, but I would give Lights 6 if I could. I love her unique sound. Still puts my baby to sleep.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have this game on my home computer and love it; the many levels and backgrounds makes it different each time you play.
0062238868|5.0|Chris Kyle did an amazing job detailing and consolidating his life's work in an exciting, fast-paced read. He was very fair and did not glorify everything he had done, instead he simply described his experiences during his time in the SEALs. The stories were unbelievable to say the least. It is a book you will not want to put done and it is perfect for anyone who admires our brave men and women who are out there serving every day. One of the best books I could recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great!  I haven't had this product for a long time, but it is a great help to have with me when I have my Kindle.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Definitely a great family movie. My three year old has watched it about three times and she doesn't get distracted by anything else. I enjoyed it a lot too!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great game, similar to Bejewelled; lots of fun.  Makes you want to keep playing it even when you have really played long enough!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  It was funny, yet family friendly which is hard to find these days.  Great animation and story line.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I thought I knew what it took to get our food to the supermarket. I truly had no clue. It is shocking what the government and corporate America are doing. I will never look at food in the same way - ever. This is worth watching by everyone - esp. those with children. Watch this without the younger children first because it is hard knowing this is truly how your food gets to you - if you can even call what is being passed off as food actual food like our great-grandparents ate. You owe it to yourself and those you love to watch this movie. You may, also, enjoy &#34;Forks Over Knives&#34; and &#34;Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead.&#34; God bless :)
B007IK44CK|4.0|Fun action movie that just keeps moving. There's no outstanding acting performance by anyone, but nothing bad either.  The action scenes are crisp and visually engaging.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you have the money you should buy this game. It may take a while for you to get used to the controls but it's worth it.
B001EV6GHU|4.0|The book gives a pretty good overview of the TOEFL format and some strategies to tackle the test. I got a Kindle version and some pages didn't show up properly but overall it's decent!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have yet to find any glitches. It has a lot more graphic pictures and obstacles than the first one. I like it.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Got the kindle version of the trilogy pretty cheap so decided to give it a read.  Good read and moves quick.  I may have to see the movies now.  Definitely will recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much fun. You can get a bunch of characters and boards and missions. I have Fresh, Tagbot, Ninja, Trixie, and Jake.
1452110581|4.0|My 8 yr old & I loved reading the poems,  It was a gift four his aunt which I hope she enjoyed too
1452110581|5.0|I got this book for my mom for her birthday. She wanted it and I had no idea. She loves cats and the hilarious poems. So, if you love cats and humor, my guess is that this book is right for you!
B003UYUQZW|3.0|When i first saw the trailer for this movie, it didn't look like something i'd go out of my way to see, plus it's a Disney movie, so i knew it would have limited Violence. I saw it available on Amazon for a super cheap price, and took a chance. It paid off, cuz i would've paid a few bucks more for this and would've been satisfied. The story of a street rat that's taken in by the king and raised as one of his three sons Jake Gyllenhaal's character (can't remember his name) is framed for his adopted fathers murder, and must find out who is responsible before his brothers catch him, and put him to death. The action is good, Love Gemma Arterton as the Princess trying to flee from Gyllenhaal half the movie. Never played the video game myself, and like i said, didn't have much faith that i'd like it going in, but very pleased with it. No issues with the DVD as far as quality. A very good buy.
B00992CF6W|1.0|who even buys this!?!?!? minecraft on the computer is soooo better PC Sufis no witches multiplayer or moss.this is crap
B008I34ZFW|2.0|I fell for the adds saying it was a laugh out riot and etc. It was funny at times, but not as near as i'd hoped it would be. Maybe my expectations were too high, i don't know. I liked the blonde girl/Nazi, and the Sarah Palin look alike as president was worth a chuckle, but very disapointed. The violence was weak, NO NUDITY, and the comedy needed work. It says &#34;I don't like it&#34; when i clicked on the two stars, but i consider one star or less as don't like, it had some moments.
B008P6HZ2M|5.0|You will be sorry if you don't read this book.  It is non fiction, lots of great research and a story that will take your breath away.
B0085A9J18|5.0|Great movie, Action is non stop ! Unbelievable how martial arts has progressed over the years, especially in Cinema. Well worth the money, DVD quality was perfect. The story line is a simple one, Cops go into a building to get one man, but can they get out ? I loved the fights senes, and there were many, three GREAT ones in particular. If you love Martial Arts movies and don't mine sub titles, GET THIS FLIK !!!!!!!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Very slow. Hate the new Q; All I can say is (and I won't spoil it) way way at the end was the best! Hopefully they are alluding to going back to &#34;traditional Bond.&#34; I can only hope.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I enjoyed bits and pieces of the book.  I usually do not enjoy memoirs, so my feelings about the book are to be expected.  However, there were many entertaining and funny stories.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|FLIGHT as a testament to a Twelve Step program may work well. As entertainment and as a vehicle for Denzel to soar, it is pretty much a wash. Watch AMERICAN GANGSTER instead. It is Denzel Washington at his Finest!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was an easy and intriguing read.  It made for an entertaining book to take travelling.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Underground shelter life was not very interesting, missed the Hunger Games at the center of each story, couldn't believe Katniss would vote to put Capitol's children in a Hunger Games
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|you go in and all you do is dig dig dig.  why do you have to run from a bull when you start to attack a cow for meat.<br /><br />  -Mason Cambria
0061743526|5.0|This book is arguably one of my favorite book. It sheds light on issues that haunts our past and personal issues lingering in the present.GREAT BOOK!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Lots of interesting puzzles in addition to the typical hidden object type.  Awesome graphics and fun adventure but why do all the best games have to be so creepy?  C'mon guys!  How bout the same caliber of game play but with a new and different type of genre and theme?  I'd purchase many more but I'm done with ghosts and skulls for now.
B009OYSFDM|1.0|I can't get past 24 seconds of the show after purchasing it from Amazon. It's not a network issue, I'm downloading other apps at 1 mg/sec so it's Amazon... very disappointing to pay money and not receive service. The show is great, Amazon not so much.
1451695195|3.0|I liked the part where he described what he experienced but that took up such a small part of the book.  It was very believable and he goes to great lengths to make it all scientific.<br />  I would have liked him to interpret his feelings he was having as he went through this experience and be more descriptive of what was happening and what he saw and heard while there.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Hard to control pacman.  Don't find it like regular game of long ago.  Love original pacman. Very disappointed with the game.
0345803493|5.0|Come on girls.  You know the drill.  A must have on your shelf.  Even 80 year old grandmas have all 3 volumes.<br />  E. L. James we are waiting........
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I learned a lot about the contrasts between the very rich and the very poor in Indian society from this engrossing book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved everything about this book- the innocent yet passionate love between Holder and Sky......it's a definite page turner.<br />I am officially a Colleen Hoover fan!!!
B00B2DSK06|5.0|We had a good laugh and love the surprise at the end. The story is well thought through and definitely a good movie for the entire family. Nice job, Disney!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutley loved this book. The way it was written as journal entries up to the present was just different and exciting. around the middle when the twist really hit I just couldn't put it down.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|Downloaded this for some Saturday night movie time with the kids. They had seen the previews and were excited to watch the movie. It had a few moments where it slowed down a bit, but the movie was good and the kids were entertained. A lot of references to 80's video games and pop culture at the time, but didn't matter to my kids.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great idea, I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />This is a nice compliment to the Kindle, Now I can listen to my favorite music anywhere in the world.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a really fun game that I enjoy on my free time mostly anytime actually .its a fun game that makes the time go by.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|great mix of character and story.<br />kept me engaged.<br />like early John Grisham.<br />would recommend this book to anyone.<br /><br />!
B005M68S4W|4.0|Tony Bennett has always been a favorite singer.  When other top artists join him in Duets, it's a fantastic miusical experience.  I would recommend to others.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|An interesting insight into a very unpleasant world (on both sides).  Most disturbing is the ignorance about the people routinely killed in the line of duty.  That is the soldiers life, but it isn't encouraging to know that the people who kill on our behalf think in this way.<br /><br />The actual account of the raid itself is short and gripping.

B007FEZQF8|4.0|I haven't read a comic in probably 15 years but love TWD on AMC. I was finally tempted to buy a couple volumes an just finished the first within a few hours. The story is a bit different from the show as I had heard but I think that makes it more interesting to read. Overall these comics are quick reads that keep your attention at all times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I heard about this app from a friend now it is one of my favorite apps. The games are very fun and the challenges are great! The best part is the app is free!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really cool game. Subway surfures is a really cool time consuming game that you can play forever. I have it on my kindle fireand it never has to buffer or freezes at all.it also has a world tour option on it so you could almost call them levels. Almost like temple run but better!  Its based in the future so tethered are robot characters and the thing you ride on is a hover board.

B00BKTWBMA|3.0|Clapton seems to have gotten to a point where he doesn't care about pleasing his droves of fans by providing what is \\"expected.\\"  With Old Sock, we get Clapton, playing what he wants to play, and I don't feel as if he's giving anyone what they want, record company or fans.  In honesty, this isn't completely what I \\"wanted,\\" but nonetheless there is some to appreciate about \\"Old Sock\\" if you take away your initial expectations.<br /><br />I grew up stealing my father's John Mayall albums and marveling at Clapton soaring blues guitar playing.  I eventually discovered Blind Faith, Cream, and Clapton's solo work.  I would get DVD's and watch him play guitar trying to emulate every move he made while sitting in my basement with my Stratocaster.  It was Clapton and SRV all day every day for me.  So yes, I'm a little bit of a blues guitar freak, so I wouldn't be opposed to another scorcher from Clapton.<br /><br />What we do get here is an album that more showcases Clapton's singing, a backing band that consists of many greats at times including Taj Mahal, JJ Cale, Steve Winwood , Paul McCartney and Chaka Khan.  His voice is rich, fruitful and the album is somewhat carefully constructed and is a very \\"pleasant\\" listen.  But to be honest, that's all it is, pleasant.  There is nothing here that makes me sit back and marvel the music, which is what I've come to expect from Clapton.<br /><br />From the very first reggae infused chord of \\"Further on Down the Road\\" until the end of \\"Our Love is here to stay\\" I feel like I listened to a good album, but certainly not one I expected from Clapton.  This is a tame album, with great subtlety, but not the great showmanship that I've come to expect from Clapton.  While many of the songs are covers and can wholeheartedly say I like the original versions better.  To which I can hear the Simon Cowell saying in my head, \\"that was rubbish.\\"  While on the other side of me appreciates Clapton's nonchalant, warmer side that we haven't seen so much.<br /><br />So as you can tell, although not enthralled by this release I don't think its complete junk.  It just isn't what I wanted.  I'll put it away with the rest of my Clapton records, and if it comes up while my computer is on shuffle I'll be fine with that, but I'm certainly not going to play this album from beginning to end many more times.<br /><br />---------<br /><br />PS - WHAT is up with the cover photo! I have a hard time believing Clapton was shown the photo and he was like \\"yeah, that's the one!\\"  I understand the \\"vacation\\" like tone of it fitting in with the album...but for serious!?<br /><br />---------<br /><br />I guess he took the photo...uch.<br /><br />So as you can tell, although not enthralled by this release I don't think its complete junk.

B00000099X|3.0|I had my concerns while bying this product since I saw versions of Aenima vinyl being sold at more than 100euros but I thought I should give it a chance.<br /><br />Saddly I was dsisapointed by the quality of the product,Poor artwork and quality,labels were sloppy placed,no actual reference on which side is which on each vinyl.As for the sound quality itself,its listenable but definitely not worth the 45 euros.You can get yourself a flac version of Aenima and have the same or even better results.
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|David Bowie's new album \\"The Next Day\\" is a fascinating listen that seemingly challenged me to listen to it as analytically as possible.  It is emotionally different, which one would expect with all that's happened with Bowie in the last decade.  The energy is more contemplative, down-trodden, and reminiscent.  The second I got bored with a track I would in the next moment be entranced by his lyrics or the subtleties of his voice throughout the album.  One thing is for sure, Bowie is at a stage of his career where he doesn't \\"need\\" to make music for us, so whether you like this album or not, I'm not sure he cares.<br /><br />Although lacking upbeat-positive easy to listen to songs, this album will engage you from the start.  Each song is layered with complexity in mixing, folk song like story based lyrics and also a relentless quality that can make parts of the album tough to make it through without checking out the next song.  The part that becomes somewhat redundant at times is the \\"muscular\\" quality that in entrenched in many of the songs.  But like much of this, the very thing that annoys me makes me all the more captivated by Bowie's music.<br /><br />Ethereal and atmospheric aren't words I often think of when thinking of Bowie's career, yet the songs that contain these qualities are some of the best on this album.  Partly because they<br />are the most varied here, but also because I find myself often lost in them the entire way through.  The finest example here is the song \\"Heat.\\"  With the chorus/tagline \\"And I tell myself I don't know who I am\\" Bowie examines one of the central philosophical themes of this album.<br /><br />Other songs I found myself entranced with are:<br /><br />\\"How does the grass grow,\\"  Upbeat, emanating synth, and a really catchy vocal phrasing.  Reminds me the most of his older work of anything on the album.  \\"Will you still love me if we could go back,\\" he sings calling a contemplative tone that juxtaposes the tempo of the song.  Melancholy in a brilliant way.  Also has great guitar work.<br /><br />\\"Dirty Boys,\\" Almost sounds like something out of a Tom Waits album, although definitely has Bowie's down-trodden tone all over it.  Love the feel of this song and the hard hitting drums.  Nice change of pace to the chorus as well.<br /><br />\\"(You Will) Set the world on fire,\\"  Throughout this album it's incredible how cohesive the tracks work together, but how different each song can sound from one another as individual entities.  This one is as catchy as any song he's ever recorded and it may be my favorite track on the album.  Bowie's still got plenty of life in him and he proves it here with this observational piece on performing.<br /><br />Overall Bowie has surprised me with this album in a good way.  He delivers an album that may not excite a new generation into a frenzy, but he certainly has delivered his current fans a great textured album full of songs that contain musical depth.lancholy in a brilliant way.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was hooked from the first episode!  It's got drama, intrigue, and humor.  The character development is superb and the plot lines are well thought out.  You will not be disappointed!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Excellent book. Everyone should read it. Easy to understand and apply to your life. Rent, buy it, or gift it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Simultaneously heart breaking and heart warming, this has been one of the most original books that I have read in a long time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is packed full of twists and turns.  Takes us back down memory lane to \\"catch up\\" with old friends or foes, reinforces our love ir hate for characters, takes us into new territory and gives us lots of zombie butt kicking!
B00AALXPN8|5.0|Great for a family night in. Lots of laughs. My kids loved it, and it kept the adults laughing too.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is awesome!  We bought it from Amazon because that allowed us to watch it on a) ipad b) kindle fire c) smart tv d) iphone or itouch.  Much more flexible buying movies through Amazon verus iTunes.
B005FISBTO|3.0|We're a little disappointed in this series so far but still enjoy them.  We're only on disc two and Dexter doesn't seem as evil and plotting as he has in the past.
B004W2UBYW|2.0|After the first couple of chapters, I got bored reading this. Maybe I didn't give it enough time but I'm also not a Jobs fanatic.  I love Apple products but I won't fall on my sword for them.  Maybe if I was, the book would have had more interest to me.
141690977X|5.0|Got the book for my daughter who was going through a tough time with her break up with her ex.  I also let my girlfriend read because she was having problems too.  Good book.
B00991TCOG|5.0|So I purchased this CD because it was not available on Spotify nor online download from Amazon. I just tried to put the songs into my Kindle Fire using the USB sync on Windows Media Player and they aren't showing up in the Device Music list (but the other artists albums I added at the same time showed up). I looked at the file list from my computer and it says they are in fact there, but nowhere to be found inside my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />What gives? Anyone else have this problem? Kinda bummed.<br /><br />LOVE this album, by the way.
0425263916|5.0|Got the book and enjoyed it - read it in a week.  Will be ordering another one very soon - keep up the good work.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|The plot and main character are a bit simpler than the trilogy with Jason Bourne, but equally enjoyable. Well-balanced action, conspiracy, and relational elements.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|What can you say, all of the &#34;old&#34;action heroes in one place blowing stuff up? Second in a series of what I hope would be more, cant get enough of this old guys kicking butt !!!
0553382152|5.0|After the second recommendation to read this book I finally got it. I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone who has questions about what happens when we die. I have read many books on this subject, and I would put this in the top 5 books that I have read on this subject, if not the top 3. I would re-read it, but I have a long list of friends in line to borrow it, so when I do eventually get it back, I will be re-reading it myself.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|Was a bit skeptical when renting it, but was nicely surprised.  The theme was the same, the rest of the movie completely new and different. Very enjoyable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well, let's start off by saying Happy Birthday to me, and it was an utmost pleasure to finish reading this incredible (wink) novel, on my birthday.<br /><br />I guess sometimes reviews don't lie.<br /><br />The story line, while not the most original, was executed brilliantly!<br /><br />Apart from a few times when I wasn't aware of the switch in a scene, I thoroughly enjoyed Sky aka Hope and Dean's journey.<br /><br />This book whilst about sexual abuse, is also about how beautiful the mind is designed and the capabilities of that of a 5 year olds brain.<br /><br />I was glad that each character was an individual and didn't have to rely on anyone to show their true colors.<br />I appreciate the eclectic mix of characters and their lifestyles.<br /><br />I honestly love Sky, because minus the tragedies and bad decisions she made before she found Holder, she is what most teen girls who are bullied should aspire to be.<br /><br />I love the sexy, strong confidence that she oozed and I was honored to have gotten the story from her POV, as it was refreshing and filled me with a lot of emotions.<br /><br />Holder was an intense character and as such, these two were emotionally light years ahead of that of two 17 and 18 years olds.<br />He was passionate, sincere, loyal, trustworthy, mature and above all, rational! (hardly find that in teen dramas these days)<br /><br />I loved this book from beginning to end and appreciated the writing styles (even down to the hours, as I have never experienced that writing style before).<br /><br />I believe that Ms. Hoover made a very serious and troubling every day occurrence, into an intriguing and well written novel that peeled back the layers and got you to understand down to the core.<br /><br />I liked the three way link between Karen, Sky aka Hope and Les. It showed not only each character's struggle, but the different paths, similar situations can push us.<br /><br />Whilst I am sorry for the path Les chose, I am fully satisfied with the outcome and events of this book.<br /><br />Not everyone could get justice, and this was by no means a happy ending, but it was closure and at the end of the day, it's all I need from a book!<br /><br />P.S. Happy Birthday to me :)d with the outcome and events of this book.<br /><br />Not everyone could get justice, and this was by no means a happy ending, but it was closure and at the end of the day, it's all I need from a book!<br /><br />P.S.

1781164266|5.0|Dead Space harbors that forboding stillness of the unexplained, what is lurking in the shadows and there is no where to run and no one can help you. The game is fantastic, outer space and horror combined to create a spine chiller haunting tale. The Art of Dead Space is extraordinary, for it allows you to see alot of the characters, environments, monsters and tools in great detail. I was very impressed and satisfied with this book.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I like it very good fit for the Kindle, holds tight and protects it very well. I love the book look too, so you get it all in one package.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the best Mars exploration novels I've read.  No.  This is the best Mars exploration novel I've read.  The science and humor and determination are what set this novel apart.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A little confusing at times bc of big words, but an overall wonderful book!! :) :) :) :) :) :)
B00BLFY61M|4.0|Well, this really will be a needle in a haystack of reviews. On the whole, the film isn't bad -- it's well produced, with an eye for period detail and excellent casting. The actors are all fine, with Bryan Cranston and the six diplomatic escapees-in-hiding turning in particularly excellent performances. Kyle Chandler bears a remarkable resemblance to Hamilton Jordan. The sense of constant but not always nail-biting tension is maintained expertly, even though you know they're all going to get out. There are a couple of flaws, in my estimation: First, as an historical film the movie ignores or distorts real events and people. Second, the hairbreadth escape at the very end is, I'm sure, manufactured just for the sake of the film and strikes me as quite artificial and overly melodramatic. To be honest, I don't think this deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. Still, it's a good picture and worth seeing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Suspenseful and captivating! A love story worth reading again. Can't wait to see the movie...
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Though the book definitely had a message, it was a bit bizarre.  Not at all like Albom's other books, which have been personal and motivating.
0553328255|5.0|Had read some Sherlock Holmes stories and this is a great little compact book with lots of stories packed in. Awesome!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this story, good guys, bad guys, honor, dishonor all within the time frame of world war 1.  An interesting view of England's upper class and how they dealt with change.
B00A0A59IS|5.0|I bought this album because I'm a massive fan of One Direction! I love their music, and I believe this was an improvement upon their already amazing first album, Up All Night. I know all of the songs, and the bonus tracks are some of my favorites. :) I would definitely recommend this!
B007MCTTHY|1.0|not all levels can be solved no matter how it's done.  I quickly removed this game and will not reinstall it anytime soon
0446310786|5.0|Great book. I'm glad it was required reading for my son who is a freshman. He enjoyed it as well.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It's a good read. I like it.<br />It's a good read. I like it. &#34;6 more words required.&#34; :)&#62; haha
B00B19DMUE|4.0|i like JD Morgan, so pretty much anything was gonna be ok w/ me, but this movie was pretty darn good and crept up on u as it progressed.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|...the gun-powder treason and plot. I know of no reason the gun-powder treason should ever be forgot.<br /><br />&#34;People should not fear their governments; governments should fear their people&#34;.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie with  brilliant, superbly-written dialogue rendered beautifully by an excellent cast. Well, well worth watching, time and again.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|they made fun of his age through out this movie & although i like Daniel Craig - this movie it showing it's age, but after 50 years of the same movie theme - it's gotta be hard to &#34;wow&#34; & hit the ball outta the park everytime. still - good movie
B00AR83PN4|4.0|I love this game!  My sister played over my shoulder!  She couldn't help herself and now plays it as well.  WE had a really good time with this, so I loaded it at home and now I play it all the time.  I've tried a couple of these cube games and love them all!  Great therapy and good for wasting time!!
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|i didn't expect much from this but - as a movie it was well done - rehashed story - predictable, but sometimes, even though u know what's gonna happen - it's ok b'cuz it's a fun ride.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Saw this in theater on IMAX. I'm pretty picky when it comes to buying movies, but I knew I had to get this.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I picked up this app while it was free and forgot about it for a few weeks. Once I got to it, I was floored. This is one of those apps that you wonder how you vot along without it. Anytime I want to stream something to a tv, boom its done. I didnt have to root my device or anything like that. Fool proof. I would highly reccomend it to anyone, and I have.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is easy to understand and begin playing. As levels progress, it does become more challenging.<br />This is actually a very good game for helping with understanding math concepts, applications and how they work in real time.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Opens with a chase over over the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul as an agent list has been lost.  Bond and a female agent give chase as M is in a control center spouting orders, which include taking a high risk shot.  Bond falls a great distance and we get the psychedelic images as Adele sings [[ASIN:B009KY0TE4 Skyfall]].<br /><br />M writes Bond's obituary and then she become the target of a cyber terrorist, seems she gave-up somebody in the past and they are out for revenge.  Bond reappers, it is never explained how he survived.  But, he seems out of sorts.  There is a new young Q.<br /><br />Information is located so Bond is out to track the guy down involved with his fall.  He goes to China.  There he gets a clue and make the obligatory trip to a casino where he meets a gal which leads to a shower, oh, and the bad guy-Silva.  He shares a parable about rats with Bond and back-up arrives to capture Silva.<br /><br />He is taken back to HQ which is exactly where he wants to be.  From there it turns into [[ASIN:B004CEUEWE The Town]].  Bond spirts away M with the Aston Martin to his original homestead, [[ASIN:B00B5HQKNI Skyfall]].  Silva shows up and shoots the place to pieces. Not a very happy story. Last scene appears to set-up an early scene from [[ASIN:B002BDGSIW Dr. No]].

B00942G4UA|5.0|We need to wake up & realize that most of these diseases and illnesses like cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity, are due mainly from the chemicals, antibiotics & pesticides these companies feed the animals, that we in-turn, digest from eating these animals. Not to mention the chemicals they spray on vegetables and fruits. These companies are concerned about making money, not about the quality of the meat and produce they grow. Not to mention how they genetically modify our food without informing the consumers. I Highly Recommend you, your family, friends and loved ones all watch this movie!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's been a long 5 days since I started reading this trilogy.  I couldn't have put it down if I tried.  I laughed sometimes, but mostly I got angry or, more often, sad.  These books are brilliant and teach a lesson.  You can't hold people down forever, you can't use them however you like forever.  Eventually they will rise up, and you will be sorry for igniting the flames that smoldering in ever single human being.
0670026638|5.0|Magical storytelling within these pages, humanity in its many shades played out in a great tale with wonderful memorable characters pitted against adversity with bravery, patience and resilience.<br /><br />Very stark true and brutal realities dealt with in this story of one girl. The author done well in painting her canvas and successfully left me with two vivid opposite images, one peace and spirit and another of cold brutality, scenes from these pages may linger with you and you may be moved and thought provoked. When you sleep you may dream of the young girl trapped in a web of brutal bullying, exploitation, and suicide and then you may turn in your sleep having a strange nightmare of Extra Terrestrial like frail woman walking around naked, which all come from scenes of the young souls life in this tale.<br /><br />The author has the spotlight on very serious and plaguing issues in society such as suicide, bullying, and our universe with humor in the young girls narrative. This is told in first person narrative and has a great connection with the reader right from the get go your are called to account and become immersed and embedded in the story. A mediation work in some ways, on time and memory, a glorious splendor on courage and the beauty of humanity against the darkness of the heart.<br /><br />A read that will be hitting a lot of best of 2013 lists! Original and an important work of literary fiction that is long overdue and needed in today's tidal wave and onslaught of adversities that humanity faces.<br /><br />Storytelling with slices of darkness and light, yin and yang, a sheer work of brilliance.<br /><br />  \\"Print is predictable and impersonal, conveying information in a mechanical transaction with the reader's eye.<br />  Handwriting, by contrast, resists the eye, reveals its meaning slowly, and is as intimate as skin.\\"<br /><br />  \\"When old Jiko talks about the past, her eyes get all inward-turning, like she's staring at something buried deep inside her body in the marrow of her bones. Her eyes are milky and blue because of her cataracts, and when she turns them inward, its like she's moving into another world thats frozen deep inside ice, Jiko calls her cataracts Kuuge which means \\"flowers of emptiness.\\"<br />  I think thats beautiful.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Sometimes when grown-ups are talking to you, and you stare back at them, they start to like they're inside one of those old-fashioned TV sets, the kind with the thick dark glass, and you can see their mouths moving, only the exact words get drowned out into a lot of staticky white noise so you can barely understand them, which didn't matter because I wasn't listening anyway. Mom was talking on and on like a breakfast TV show host, and Muji was burping and trilling like a drunken sparrow, and Jiko was pretending to sleep, Dad was exhaling clouds of cigarette smoke into my clean underpants that were still hanging on the laundry line because in all the excitement Id forgotten to take them down,but none of this mattered because I was deep inside my mind, which is where I go when things get too intense.\\"<br /><br />  ` `Tomorrow I will die in battle,' said Captain Crow.<br />  Montaigne wrote that death itself is nothing. It is only the fear of death that makes death seem important. Am I afraid? Certainly, and yet...<br />  \\"Que sais-je?\\" Montaigne asked. The answer is nothing. In reality, I know nothing.<br />  And yet, at night I lie on my bed, counting my beads, one for every thing on earth I love, on and on, in a circle without end.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Making the decision to end my life really helped me lighten up, and suddenly all the stuff my old Jiko had told me about the time being really kicked into focus. There's nothing like realising that you don't have much time left to stimulate your appreciation for the moments of your life. I mean it sounds corny, but I started to really experience stuff for the first time, like the beauty of the plum and cherry blossomsalong the avenues in Ueno Park, when the trees are in bloom. I spent whole days there, wandering up and down these long, soft tunnels of pink clouds and gazing overhead at the fluffy blossoms, all puffy and pink with little sparkles of sunlight and blue sky glinting between the bright green leaves. Time disappeared and it was like being born into the world all over again. Everything was perfect. When a breeze blew, petals rained down on my upturned face, and I stopped and gasped, stunned by the beauty and sadness.\\"<br />more2read.com

It was bittersweet reading this after Chris Kyle's untimely horrific death. He went through so much fighting for us and returned home just to be killed on American soil, ironically by another soldier  he was trying to help.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Fast paced, humorous, exciting and with tons of 80's references to bring me back to my childhood.  in essence, possibly the best 80's-geek, somewhat cyberpunk-ish novel out there.
B0016LTNL4|4.0|Typical Brit humour. (somewhat slap stick) I enjoyed most of this light film, but they could use less of the &#34;f&#34; bomb.  Why script writers feel the need to insert profanity to this extent shows to me that they have run out of material.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is so fun the graphics are phenomenal I am obsessed I just can stop playing this game it pulls me in and once I start next thing I know ive been playing for an hour
B0000667RO|5.0|Love every song.  .  . can't play it enough!  If this CD is not in your collection, it should be.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I can't wait to see the next episode, it is very well written. I like the fact that a farmer become the king.
0452289963|3.0|Has some relatively good points on evaluating oneself and others.  Found it a bit antiquated for the times. Afraid love & peace days are over!
B00BESLHEA|3.0|Tarantino at his usual campy best. Fun, funny and lots of blood and gore. In fact overly done as is his usual style.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I will admit right now that I have only listened to the first 5 tracks so far and the rest I just listened to the samples...but that is enough until I am off from work...This CD is fantastic in every way...I did not care for most of his 80's work except for Scary Monsters...which let's face it was more 1979 and Let's Dance...These songs are every bit as good as anything else he has done since the Berlin Trilogy.  I like how no David Bowie CD sounds the same...and the older he gets he just keeps getting more adventurous while still being Bowie.  This CD ranks up there with Low, Heroes, Lodger, Scary Monsters, Heathen, and Reality.  Thank you for coming back to us after all these years...now TOUR!!!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Watched this because my teen son wanted to see it but came back to watch it again myself. Love the multi video game characters that made appearances, especially the bad guys anon meeting..
B000TDGGRY|5.0|The Sigma Force novels continue to thrill!  This was another imaginative, fast-paced adventure by Mr. Rollins.  If you like Ian Flemming, Dan Brown, or Michael Crichton's novel's, you will definitely like this.<br /><br />Very likeable characters who must save the world from another catastrophy week after week.  And the way Mr. Rollins links real history-mysteries with plausible, current day science is very entertaining and imaginative.  Highly recommend!
B009CPEOC4|2.0|Okay if you are a fan but not a great deal of substance. Interesting to see concert footage but total experience not for me.
B00004RYZT|2.0|I bought this video off off what I saw on Youtube. Very disappointed. To start with, the video quality was very poor, even on my dvd/ blu ray player. Secondly, I bought it to get the entire concert which includes \\"Buck Dich\\". It's the funniest part of the concert. CUT OUT ENTIRELY. I am from Germany but no longer live there. Unfortunately, my husband is dying and my son has a form of Autism so we won't be going home to see any concerts anytime soon. I was told this was the next best thing to being there. NO. Youtube and my imagination are much better. I hope I can find a more satisfying one next time. :C
0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five was a great book. I would recommend it to my friends. It tells you a story of a man kept as a Prisoner of War during WWII and flashbacks to different points in his life. It is a pretty intense book with great imagery and symbolism wrapped up in it. I feel it is a great read.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I was very happy with this season. I just began watching this series a few months ago. I loved the way the series ended and how the characters developed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was so good! So many twists and turns! Would actually like to see a sequel of this story, would like to see if Six ever finds true love, and would also like an update on Sky and Holder..................maybe? PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ;)
0689815816|5.0|I'm sooooo happy with this book.  I love that it's a board book.  We love books but are very hard on books.  Its a very durable and fun to read book.  This has quickly become one of our favorites.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am completely addicted to this game can not put it down for any period of time, would love more updates to come
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys smart, captivating, and intriguing writing.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|This is an incredible series and in lieu of what is available on television today, its *light* years better.  I wish this type of viewing was mainstream again.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|Definitely worth seeing if you like a creepy but quality movie. Will Smith is excellent as always. The storyline is nearly believable. Watch this one!
B000002LEU|5.0|this was the album that turned me on to the joy division back in tha day. great tracks: komakino, warsaw, transmission, she's lost control, dead souls, love will tear us apart. this isn't yer big sis' new order crap, this stuff is dark and way heavier than new order ever was.
B008JFUN8C|5.0|\\"Oz The Great And Powerful\\" involves a con-man named  Oscar Diggs, who later becomes the Wizard of Oz (shrewdly played by James Franco). Oscar Diggs ends up in a scenic world after promising to do great things in his life, if allowed to live.  He ends up meeting three women who are all witches: The Wicked Witch of The West, The Wicked Witch Of The East, and Glinda The Good Witch. However two of them (brilliantly played by Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz) are powerful  but evil. The third witch, Glinda The Good (depicted in a fascinating way by Michele Williams), also projects magical energy but wields her talents for good.  I liked the heartfelt love story that developed between Glinda The Good Witch and Oscar Diggs (who becomes the Wizard Of Oz).  Zach Braff also makes a cameo in the film as Finley, a hardworking assistant to Oscar Diggs.  \\"Oz The Great And Powerful\\" is the type of fantasy film to watch for those who like to see metaphorical movies on how destiny can sometimes collide with unexpected life tests.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have put off reading Holms for many years and wish I had read it sooner!  These stories are classic!
B00BEJL3IY|5.0|\\"Jack The Giant Slayer\\" involves the story of a well- meaning but over-protective man named King Brahmwell(valiantly played by Ian McShane) who seems more concerned about his daughter  Isabelle(strongly played by Eleanor Tomlinson) getting married than allowing her to explore the world around her.  Stanley Tucci plays a discreetly evil assistant to the king, but does a good job of playing it convincingly.  Ewan McGregor also projects a compelling performance in playing the protector of both the King Brahmwell and Princess Isabelle.  Nicholas Hoult plays an innocent and energetic portrayal of Jack. The character of Jack unintentionally changes the life of himself and those around him when he obtains ownership of some magic beans.  \\"Jack The Giant Slayer\\" is the type of movie to watch for those who are open to the message of how even just one person can drastically shape events for themselves and those around them.
B008YWY0HK|2.0|The disc had several chips in it and would not play past the first 1/2 hour.  I took it to the library and ran it through the cleaner/clarifier machine - it still locks up about halfway through but I can now make it continue with some glitches in the badly chipped areas.  The movie content itself is great, I love the show, however, this particular disc is bad.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I downloaded this game to help me pass the time during a long doctors office wait.  It was the perfect way to spend that time since I couldn't do anything else.  It kept me interested and challenged me.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, its got just enuff of the right ingredients to scare or make you shreik. The young girls performance was pretty good too.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|Alot more than what I expected. The cover is fantastric, and who knew this was 3 cds long. Great lay back album. Great to play in the background or just crash, relax and listen to.
B001QC9PSO|3.0|This movie is really pure nostalgia but after a while you start to dislike how cheesy and product placement this movie really becomes, such as thinking that having Vanilla Ice rapping about some Ninja Turtles who are suppose to be working in secret and in the shadows yet knowing so damn much about them is a great idea?<br />However this movie truly is marketed out to children so I can't really complain, they'll never notice.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Love, Love, Love. So happy that I got these disk set. So Happy I recieved these so soon, and I have been playing over and over again.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|A great movie that outlines the real world problems of people with addiction.  A realistic, non trite, depiction of how one gets into, and the ultimate costs of that addiction.
044024630X|5.0|Another great book in the Jack Reacher series.  This book explains why he left the Army.  You gotta' love Jack Reacher - he does what's right and he will do anything to fix a situation.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Definitely not for the weak of heart, but a superb way to finish the series. Would suggest to anyone looking for an interesting trilogy.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|If there were more stars i'd rate this the highest ever! Robert Plant does it again........he excels!!! This man is a class act. He shares the stage with amazing talent, and doesn't hesitate to share the stage and the mic.  Incredible vocals, incredible harmonies, incredible lyrics and on and on and on. Can't get enough of Band of Joy.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|One of our favorites, alot of interaction which gives chance for discussion of how things grow.  Cute pictures and variety of settings.
B000HWZ5XI|5.0|In true Robert Plant style, this album is nothing short of genius. Whether I'm doing house work or relaxing in my favorite chair, I play it loud and proud. I love this.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|This book is what I expected from Patrick Rothfuss and definitely matches the quality of his first novel. It will keep you guessing, waiting, and wanting to read more with every turn of the page. Rothfuss brings you in and keeps your there making this novel a journey that the author and the reader take together.
B00AU2B0DE|3.0|The CD didn't come in very nice conditions. The cover was broken, which wasn't really pleasant to found out. The CD's quality is great but I would have preferred the CD to be completely perfect. I don't want this to happen again, thanks.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The sequel to Bared to You delivers as it promises! The more Eva and Gideon the better! A lot of questions are answered from the first book and you see Eva develop along with the relationship between her and Gideon. Another book full of YUM without the dom/sub crazy! I was on the edge of my seat with the middle and end. Love, love, love how the author writes! This would be a perfect anytime read! Another book hard to put down! Hurry up May! Entwined in You comes out soon!
B00992CF6W|4.0|u need to let us quickly change our skin without trouble if u did then I would give it 5stars
B00846REIS|5.0|If you love 50 Shades of Grey, you will ADORE this book! Along the same lines with a dominant man and independent girl falling in love in the most extraordinary circumstances. You get all of the YUM with none of the crazy dom/sub. Very well written, you are immediately pulled into the world of Crossfire. Connecting deeply with all the characters and living their secrets! Just so amazing! Read in a day...the sequel is even better...can't WAIT until May for the 3rd!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Display is nice, but I wish it were more configurable, with different font sizes.<br />Now, l must write additional words to fulfill the minimum.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Brian Sanderson's third volume in the Mistborn trilogy elevates the entire work to a higher level. I think this is probably one of the best fantasy series I have ever read, and there is really not much more that needs to be said. Very well done, and my congratulations to the author.
B0068FYZMK|5.0|The upgrade from VHS to DVD is really good, and this is still a fun movie for the whole family.  I can actually see what piece of classical music formed the basis for the main theme.
B0011Z77OK|4.0|I grew up with this band and it was one of those that were always on the radio so I never had to buy an album. Well, now I don't listen to the radio and thought the $5 price tag was too good to pass up.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Not crazy about ending but that's not movies fault.  As masterpiece always does, delivered a good version of a classic.
0316077046|5.0|I fell on love with this series after I read the first book and couldn't wait it read the second. When I picked it up and read it I was very satisfied.
B004XWLIJS|3.0|Jason gives you exactly what you expect with these movies, no more, no less. Fast, wild and crazy, fun to watch once but I won't add it to my collection.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|i like every track. softer than i expected but i like it. Its a great listen all the way through
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I purchased this recording back in the 60's when it first was released as a pre-recorded reel-to-reel tape.  The sound on the MP3 download brings out the fidelity that the tape never had.  Great Sinatra backed up by Count Bassie and his big band, wow!
B001B1CBSQ|4.0|So now I can listen to the original album and all the dirty words are there! As a 30 something it's not as shocking as maybe it would have been in my teens but I like at least 3 of these songs and the skits are funny. It does make you want to go dig into your collection and find your  Wyclef Jean and  Lauryn Hill CDs out of the case. I don't seem to have any Pras CDs.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I'm very disappointed in the way this book ended.  You have two and a half books written so wonderfully and have it end like it was rushed.  I felt cheated at the end.
B00371XIP8|3.0|This is your standard low end sequel, a bad script and bad acting thrown together to take advantage of people who loved the original.  If you loved the original you will feel betrayed by the sequel.
B004AGI2L4|3.0|They did capture, to a certain extent, the grittiness of the times. Bit more bloodthirsty than I like but hard to tell this kind of tale without it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed the twists and turns.  Not the best Grisham ever, but a good read.  A good for an airplane trip or curled up in front of a warm fire.
B003FBMS4W|3.0|Had never seen this, and bought it based upon reviews and Spielberg comments. It was OK, but certainly not a classic in my book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  I do wish though, that there weren't so many people dying all the time.  Maybe it seems like a lot because I have watched the series' episodes back-to-back while I played 'catch-up', but it's tough getting attached to a character only to have disaster strike.  Otherwise, I love the characters, costumes and the setting.  I'm also a huge fan of Maggie Smith.  She is brilliant and plays her part as if she were born to it, which perhaps she was!  lol.
B00A7OJ0DC|3.0|2012 a disappointing year for Disney animation.  Brave was just ok.  So is this one.<br /><br />You would have figured Disney would have made this enjoyable IF you are older or NOT into video games.  They did not.<br /><br />Unless you are a little kid or a video game fan you will not really care.<br /><br />Took long enough to get into the point nor important characters.<br /><br />Now, A HUGE DISLIKE OF THIS AS THEY RECENTLY DID WITH THE FIRST BLU RAY RELEASE TO THE 1953 CLASSIC \\"PETER PAN\\".  If/when you push pause instead of getting the film to pause you get five second until unnecessary stuff pops up on the screen.<br /><br />A few years ago Disney gave up on going good jobs on DVD releases & they were ONLY to blu rays.  THAT HAS STOPPED<br /><br />This is a four disc set, the discs are put in only two spots so if you want one at the bottom you have to pull two discs out.  NO art work on the discs anymore.  Cheap, cheap, cheap & so disappointing Disney.<br /><br />No special extras on this at all.<br /><br />So, the film is disappointing unless you are a kid or a video game fan, blu ray/DVD package also a disappointment.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|Acting & direction were OK, storyline was terrible. Good action sequences, but many didn't make sense given the characters & story. Just poorly written
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is far and away the best Bond in a long time.  It is head and shoulders above any of the spy thrillers of late.  I thought that  Craig and Dench were absolutely awesome in this film.  In my opinion  there was not a thing to dislike about this film.  Craig was as good as Connery as he brought back the grit and determination as well as finesse that Connery injected into Bond.  This film is so worth the money and I am thrilled to add it to my Bond collection.  I make no recommendations for other people to watch as what I like they would think it stinks. This was so worth the money that I would pay again to see it in a theater and then buy the DVD again.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I love the fact that all the books of this series are bundled so I can continue reading from one to the next without interruption. It's also convenient that the bundle shows up as a single book on my Kindle. Much easier than trying to remember which book is first, second, etc. I also loved the fact that there is a free sample book that you can read before deciding to buy. It made it easier for me to decide to purchase the whole series as opposed to just the first book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought this book but got the other 2 from the library. Was definitely worth the price, just mad that the movie screwed up the whole series.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|A wonderfully creative serial, sometimes bogged down but an overall achievement in American television. Jessica Lange anchors each season with great power.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|this was bought for my ex for Christmas  He loved it as well as the others we bought him. !
0811729117|3.0|I have read several other books by German  authors relating their service in WWII. This book doesn't offer a lot of details on battles on the Russian front during his service. It could be because he was inside a tank and had a limited view of things around him.I liked the documents showing the awards he recieved  (in German and English)and were something I haven't seen in other books. I think most readers also would like to know something about the authors life after the war in all these type books.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Overall just an amazing show. The quality and level of detail is incredible. This season did move away from the book more than I would have liked, but I understand why it was done.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Director Ang Lee has taken the Yann Martel story to another level. In the process, he has created probably a new 3D art form not seen before ( not even Avatar is at this level). It is visually stunning, cerebral and action oriented at the same time, a great story wonderfully told with twists and turns that are unexpected. Good acting all round. Ang Lee is a true genius. I am not exaggerating. See it in 3D/Blue Ray.
6303471730|1.0|I saw no mention that tape was so old it might be breaking down. The tape I received was so badly degraded, it is un-viewable. I should have guessed as much, since the return postage is more than the value of any refund.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I can't help but watch this addictive TV series despite poor acting, mediocre writing, and sometimes uneven cinematography. The special effects are nearly perfect making each zombie the star of the show, just as it should be.
145210655X|5.0|I grew up during the Star Wars era - where Anakin Skywalker was a mangled, cyberfilled ball of hate with only the vocal talents of James Earl Jones saving him from eternal peril (that Jones' voice can save the soul of a man who blew up a flipping planet is quite a testament).  My little princess grew up during the airing of Star Wars The Clone Wars where Anakin Skywalker was a barely scarred, good-natured, slightly impatient hero teaching a padawan while still needing guidance himself.  For children who's first glimpse of Anakin wasn't one of a genocidal vassal of Darth Sidius and parents who don't want to bring that up until later, this is a beautifully entertaining book.  Purists risk hating it and imagining using The Force to give wedgies to its author.<br /><br />It's cute, touching, endearing, and filled with moments where parents will relate to the poor Sith lord and children will see the Jedi in themselves.  I've read this to my daughter; she's read it to her friends; and her friends have read it to her.  It's pure, sentimental gold.<br /><br />Its only flaw is that it makes me crave the arrival of \\"Vader's Little Princess\\" that much more.
B0098G67TU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I rented it, the HD picture was great! It stalled a couple of times due to my Internet, but all in all it was a great choice!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Out of the 2 available, this is the best season. The attention to detail is incredible. This season was very accurate regarding the books. I'd recommend it to almost anyone.
B004OEJMZM|5.0|I have not read too much of this book but I have noticed the abundant amount of examples. Can't ask for too much more with this type of literature.
B006HL9G10|5.0|Though I didn't really find the instructions all that useful, the setup was pretty straightforward. The aid is helpful for this novice and the price was definitely right!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Not a bad game to play if you r bored. Just first now playing so do not have much to say yet
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Love this game.  Once I started it was difficult to put down.  Had a low battery warning many times while playing.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I ordered this book, Stephen King's, for my Kindle. Holy cow..so far, so good! Of course.  I'm not finished yet. I hate, (not really) ok, I love the way King involves me in his writing..because then I can't cook or do housework!  I am so THERE!  Buy it!
B007VYAJAE|5.0|I've been to Jamaica many times and fell in love with the island and it's people. I've even visited Nine Mile the birthplace and final resting place of Bob Marley. This is the best movie about his life that I have ever seen and many interviews with the people that knew him best. Highly recommended for all Marley fans.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|The Resident Evil films are cinematic junk food. I've seen all of them on DVD, of course nothing makes logical sense about them. But like junk food they are so tempting, and I feel guilty watching them.
0062238868|5.0|I may be cheating by doing a review before finishing the read but the book has been excellent thus far. Most importantly the service I received in purchasing the book,first time I've done something like this, turned out to be far above what I expected. It seems in todays era of business I have little faith when dealing with anyone anymore, let alone doing ALL my business online to order a book that I knew was in high demand at the time. Well my faith was restored because not only did everything go smoothly but the book arrived in just days. Since I cannot get out much due to health to hot stores to shop I will surely use this method again to purchase books, and other items in the future. As for now I look forward to finishing this book and may do a better review at that time. One that will hopefully inspire others to read it as well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|NDE is now something that a neurosurgeon has experienced and with his training knows beyond a shadow of doubt that we have testimonies of many individuals that have come back from the other side of life as we know it here on earth.  There is no question that Eben is a messanger from God, to give us hope and a clear understanding that we are not alone and that God created each of us with love, to love...the message is hope that our lives have purpose!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Passionately told, this story pales my submarine service but makes me so proud to have served. God bless the warriors who at the time can't even see the depth of love they have for their country. Cooks and commanders alike should ead this story and cry some, as I did.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|The challenge and the idea of releasing certain puzzle pieces rather than traditional clearing the board makes it challenging. Also like the challenge of trying to earn 3stars.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A very sensitive human history. Very interesting unkonwn facts about germans suffering, the fall of the third reich, and the technical opportunyties nazis loose to won the war.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|The films concept is perfect for Paul Verhoeven to direct. But Dredd unfortunately takes itself a little more seriously then the great Robocop.
B00628RVV0|4.0|My kids really liked the movie a lot. I thought it was pretty good, but not great. I guess it was good enough that I would have paid to see it in the theatre.
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|I first read The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings back in the early seventies and have had to buy several copies of each as my paperbacks kept falling apart - a huge fan.  I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy - the casting was spot-on and the effects and suspense so well done.<br />i was slightly alarmed at the thought of The Hobbit being split into three parts and having seen the first part I have to say my worst fears were fulfilled and I was vey disappointed.  Much as I love cuddly Peter Jackson, I think he has tried to turn a charming but much simpler story into a huge epic along the lines of LOTR.  He has changed a number of aspects of the story - eg the trolls scenes- one wonders why?  The dwarves are verging on the ridiculous but just manage to pull it off and Martin Freeman is - as was Elijah Wood - an unexpected but clever piece of casting.<br /> Having said that the overall film feels stretched and padded with special effects and I will have to think long and hard before buying the DVD - I even told my husband (anothr huge fan) not to bother going to see the film so he would not be as disappointed as I was.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever. I love minecraft. This game is TOTALLY worth the 7 dollars. And one thing for `can't use images. Have you ever seen minecraft? The graphics are supposed to be like that. Your supposed to just walk around. It's not COD or whatever you people play. It's survival. An indie game. Not supposed to be intense.
B00AWFEBDK|5.0|Hey, this is really deep and meaningful, its very thought provoking, gives you an understanding of how we've arrived at where we are as a world society.<br />Mr Diamond sets out his logic in a most engaging manner, its easy to follow.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Watched season 1 on Netflix, and could not wait to see season 2!  I love period dramas, especially when they involve juicy secrets.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I grew up during the golden age of arcades and I loved the game cameos throughout the film. Highly recommended!
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|We have this on our DVR and the kids watch it all the time, it is a pretty good movie even for adults, and if you are like us you turn something on to entertain them while you make dinner or clean or whatever.... The movie has lots of action to keep their attention and lots of bright colors. It also has good music throughout so even not watching, but listening is great also (we actually bought the soundtrack to listen to). We got this movie to play in our car on longer trips because the kids want to watch it in the car. Highly recomended!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this Game Is Great But Not Great Enough I Think It Still Needs More Features For Us Teenagers To Like It
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|First: I am a LONG time Bowie fan. I have worn out his catalog with sheer joy over the years. That aside -  let me be as conservative as possible here . . .  This is an AMAZING and TRUE TRIUMPH for Bowie!!!  A TRUE Master-stroke in the Bowie overall catalog.<br /><br />I am now on the 8th full listen over 3 days (with headphones mostly) . . . This is pure old school Bowie but in 2013.  Not just old school from the Berlin period either . . . the track \\"Valentines Day\\" goes back to his late 60's sound vocally (laughing gnome enyone?) and there is lot's of Ziggy Stardust and Diamond Dogs/Young Americans vibe here for sure. Oh, and and a healthy dose of Scary Monsters as well.  It is an \\"old Bowie fan\\" fantasmagasm. Seriously this CD is worthy of all its critical acclaim thus far. A true Bowie gem that has all that makes Bowie so good . . . surreal lyrics, top musicians from Bowie's heyday, impeccable old school production, that \\"Bowie swing/vibe\\" that defiess articulation  ... it's ALL here and its so great he is back in such a devastating way! Could not be happier as a lifelong fan . . . will go down historically as top 5 Bowie albums ever. Yes, its that good.
B005USZYDU|4.0|A bit out of the box for this author - and it held my interest - but I was so disappointed in the ending.  It did NOT actually bring the trial the story was about to a satisfactory conclusion - in my opinion.  Read it, and form your own opinion.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|great movie, now able to watch this with my kids and they loved it. Going to have to buy this movie!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I picked up this series a few months ago after watching the second season of A Game of Thrones on HBO. I had to know what happened next! Well, having finished all five of the currently available books in the series I am enthralled. The characters are well constructed and enjoyable even in their flaws. I have been shocked and amazed and affected by the loss of certain main characters. I am thoroughly impressed with the humanity portrayed in the flaws and missteps of all the characters. I worry for the future of some of my favorites. I find the political intrigue to be compelling and well crafted.<br /><br />Honestly, I could do with less vivid descriptions of every meal that is eaten and of each of the thousand characters' heraldry. However, the complete descriptions of all of these objects does help build the imagery in my mind. I could not put down the series until I had run out of books. I would recommend this highly to anyone.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Thoughtful views from the narrator about the survival his odd life takes. Somehow I felt an incompleteness  in the story but appreciated the writing.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I'm not a big fan of Sparks, sure I've read a few of his books turned movies, but after reading reviews of Safe Haven I figured \\"why not\\". It was a little difficult starting out, but soon enough I couldn't put the book down. The ending however was short, sudden, and a let down.<br />I don't like the way Sparks used Jo in this story, it was too unreal for me. Especially since the rest of the book was good.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I love Wes anderson. And everything he does. This movie is fantastic.<br />Then transaction was great.<br /><br />Moonrise Kingdom really is the next step. I look forward to his next movie.
B00BHU9CCO|5.0|Even if we watch this movie a million times, the next time is always just as good.  Adults and children will enjoy this movie
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I downloaded this game for my 4 year old and ended up really liking it myself. bb hgxdxj vigcuh k jk
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This app is absolutely fantastic . The talks are very thought provoking and well presented as well.<br />I highly reccomend this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it because it is just like temple run but with more characters and objectives and I also like thee letters you have to spell out to win coins
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I was so impressed at how strong and brave Jaycee Dugard really is. And how she was so brave to put in every detail to this book. This book is not reccomended to younger teens for language and details.
B00000JMOJ|5.0|This is totally a precursor to the present day hit &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;.  While the storyline isn't identical, it's still similar enough to appreciate.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My son loves this game, it's fun, and he gets good brain practice from it! :)<br />I think it's well worth the purchase for your little one, mine loves it!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|best game ever I doubt the ten peaple that rated this bad (one star) even played it. Everyone that can get it do because it is hours of entertainment
B00B2V66VS|4.0|one of the best games I have ever played or defenitly in the top 10 and it just gets better and better the more you play it. It is awesome and I would by this if I were you.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I have never really been much on biography's just because they are hard to hold my interest but I found this compelling. The patriotism that Chris Kyle had was unbelievable. I found it very interesting to not only hear the stories of what Chris went through overseas and at home from his and his wife's points of view but also the brotherhood between our soldiers. I read this book in twice the time I normally would have read one of equal length mainly because It was very hard to set down. Great, moving book of one of America's greatest heroes!
B004UJAOLM|3.0|If you pay really good attention and have an addiction to classics and a English feel than this is the book for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game was ok at first but then with updates it got so much better. I have every hereon of minecraft I try to get my homework done just to play this trust me this is worth $7 (: (: (: (: (: (:
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This is one of my favorite apps on my kindle fire hd but it should have some kind of multiplayer mode.  It also should give you more time in the beginning.  Other than that it's awesome.
1401322786|4.0|It was a book that made you think about time....parts of it were kind of hard to understand but overall it was a good book. I think I liked some of his other books better.
B000A2UBN4|5.0|liked the movie and thought I would just add to my collection of &#34;scary&#34; movies - waiting to view it again
B005CMSDKA|2.0|The product itself is fine as was the shipping and transaction.  I can't even say the acting was bad, but the mixed together story line feels incomplete and you are left pondering everyone's true fate as well as their original purpose.  The movie leaves a disgusted feeling in your stomach and the dizziness of being on a merry-go-round for too long.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book about 6 months before I had ever even heard about the movie and I was so addicted by the story. I love how the woman is the star and she is very self reliant and she sticks up for herself and her family. This is honestly the best saga I have ever read. There is no comparison to the Twilight saga! It is so much better. I reccomend this book to everyone. Men and women and kids alike. There is an awesome lesson to be learned. I loved it so much I gave it to my principal to read and he like it too! And he is over 40 years old! lol
B001I8A76A|5.0|Just fun listening, and nice to hear the songs without words taken out!  May have to purchase another &#34;Pink&#34; soon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just like the first, it was hard to put down once I started to read. I can't wait to read the 3rd book.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Pretty cool story. Author relies on tricks to blow your mind more than the actual idea. It will however be very satisfying when he pulls the rabbits out of the hat. Takes awhile to get there. Great character development. The Science part is not even close to being accurate.I'm ok with that. The Sociological part more than makes up for that. I'm reading the next one ,so if that is any indication that I like the writer , then enjoy the ride.
B002W5UVSM|5.0|read this book a long time ago and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to get it for my Kindle
B003DTMUOE|5.0|Paulo Coelho su mejor obra en mi opinion hasta hoy dia. Un libro lleno de aprendezija, amor, auto estima. Un libro que te da energia a seguir tus suennos y no darte por vencido.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Steven kings writings. The way he describes the town's you could visualized them. Allot of history in this book. A must read.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Liked the song &#34;Now your Just Somebody ...&#34; so I purchased this to see what else they had released.  Good music
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like doing puzzles so this game was good for me. More variety would be better but it was free so it's ok.
B002NT3B52|2.0|Not what I was expecting.  Too scientific for me, was a struggle getting through the first few chapters and then I put it down for good.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|recommended to me - never saw the movies but was told they were good so I just got them -
B008GJVH7M|4.0|I liked this movie. It had a lot of action in it.  I love movies that's from back in the days
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|i really enjoyed this game, I just wish it was longer. Then again what do you expext for 2.99! I hope a sequel will follow. I loved the graphics to.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Need to fix update. I cant even find the app to uninstall it. Must fix asap. I dont even want the piece of $hi$ but Cant get rid of it. If there was a rating lower than one, that would be it. Things like this really ruin the credibility of a development company
1401938906|5.0|This should be required reading for every 6th grade science class in the world!<br />I would reccomend this to everyone.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|nice change from the desktop. love the large numbers and easy to use. I do recommend.<br />and I don't need my glasses to use it, even better.  you should definitely get this one
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Picked up right when the first book ended and was just as enjoyable and exciting as the first.  Can't wait to purchase book three!!
B002JODUI4|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD! It's perfect. I listen to it pretty much every day. A deff buy for anyone that loves Deadmau5!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|if it wasn't for the occasional freezing and momentary glitches I would have given this game 5 stars. you can't beat the cost either.
B00BP4X7TG|3.0|The two leads were very affecting and charming. The story, although apparently based on fact, is built on the premise that the cultured (white people) can learn something of value from the primitive (black people) and vice versa, is pretty hackneyed and stereotypical. But, how do you get financing for a movie like this anyway? This script is the answer.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a neat little app that lets you go into your device's memory directories as well as the memory card. I've been using it for quite a while and I have never had a problem with it.
B009WHDFPE|5.0|I think this is the best yet when it comes to the humor of these movies. Scratch is still great!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Good, but the ending sort of left me thinking &#34; what's happening next ?&#34;. Need a second book to tie up loose ends.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|Disappointed in movie but more disappointed that the Blu-Ray freezes around 20-25 minutes.  Didn't watch it in time to return it so stuck with it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an easy read and I enjoyed the character and setting switching. The writing was very good and fluid.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a great game for kids to enjoy. I think its for kids and adoults.thank you and get this game you will love it
B003B2C92G|5.0|An interesting story with decent special effects for its time. This is the blu-ray release, it was originally on DVD. As a live action movie, they tried to cover too much material in too little time, so it seems a bit disjointed at times.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This comes along with the first two and is just as funny with all the same great characters. Good family fun!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Not much of a plot.  I got tired of hearing each main character complain about their spouse. Nothing thrilling here.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I thought the book was great; however it only gets 4 stars because it was slow paced for a good 10 chapter or so. I understand the chapters were supposed to further development  characters, but a few of the chapters could have  been left out and the story wouldn't have suffered for it. With all that said, the story I great an  the characters are great. I can see then makings of a fantastic tale.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|Fun little movie easy to follow would watch it again.  Good job acting.  I could imagine being there.  I recommend.
B00428CPUY|5.0|Another present for my husband.  He loved it and it was great to take on vacation this year.  Worth owning
B007U4DIM6|3.0|Disney sent this third installment straight to DVD probably realizing it wouldn't grab big box office numbers.  However, the series is popular with kids and you can see why---cute dogs, cute dogs and more cute dogs.  There's the necessary family values, bumbling villains, and prospects of doom avoided by eleventh hour heroics by the dogs.  It's all harmless fun and one can't help getting into the festivities.  The voice casting led by George Lopez and Odette Annable does well and the humans gracefully play second fiddle to the canine stars.<br />Is BHC3 great film-making?  No---but its good family viewing.  A 4th entry is probably right around the corner.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie in general. The plot was not bad but it was a little too extreme. I understood it all but there so much build up then it kind of fizzeled out toward the end.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is great for the hard to put to sleep. I'm up and down most nights but with this app I seem to sleep straight through.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I can go by accuweather and trust it.  easy to access and review.  clear and confident.  good and feasible graphics
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Sooo amazing! I'm teaching it to my eighth grade English class. So much wwii history and Death as a narrator. Very cool insight.
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|I have only heard this album once, so at this point I can say is that I like this album better than the last album (my least fav Bon jovi album). It feel like a lot of effort went into the lyrics and the melody part. It reminds me of their album \\"Crush\\".<br />  The first single \\"because we can\\" is in line with all the other first singles that have come out by the band with the catchy hook,the arena anthem feel to it. Good song. Apart from the single, other songs that I have liked so far are \\"I'm with you, what about now, pictures of you, whats left of me, the fighter, & with these two hands...also the Jon Bon Jovi song from the movie stand up guys. Theme to this album is the same as the \\"Circle\\" album which is tough times, not losing hope, believing in yourself etc. Lyrically Because we can, whats left of me and the fighter are my favorite songs.<br />  There are no surprises in this album, its the band doing what they have been doing in the last few years.<br />  What I miss in this album is Richie Sambora's guitar work, the riff's and solo's. I have been listening to this band for 20 Years now, I do hope they make songs that have more of a feel like the one's from the 80's and 90's (New Jersey and Keep the faith). I am not a critic, just a guy who is sharing what he feels.<br />Let's see how I feel about this album in the next couple of days after listening to it couple of more times.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|the movie was great, the kids loved it. It will be watched many times in our house.<br /><br />The only issue i can see, is all the name calling between Ralph and the racer glitch girl. somehow this is deemed cool, when I teach my kids to never call names....
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this is a great game indeed but it is very similar to temple run and the characters need more expression but over all this game is great
B009JBZH54|1.0|i have to say that u forgot the &#34;dark knight rises movie&#34; i recived 4 insted 5 disc!!! i want it back!!
B00133KFGW|5.0|I really, really liked this movie!  It was very sad in parts and emotional.  Little August, I really liked him!  Very good movie.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|A complete and total waste of an incredible actor's talent! Carl Urban is an outstanding actor. I hope he was paid a ton of cash for this debacle!!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Since I'm a huge fan of the show I just had to get the CD. I love all of the songs.
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|Ludovico Einaudi is one of the best contemporary composers in the world, so when I say that this new album is perhaps his strongest to date, that is saying a lot. Whereas the title track, \\"Time Lapse,\\" possesses some of the intense edginess that permeates Einaudi's most recent album, \\"Nightbook,\\" most of the other pieces represent a gentler, melodic approach more akin to his work in \\"I Giorni\\" or \\"Le Onde.\\" (The track, \\"Burning,\\" in particular contains a wave-like bass note pattern highly reminiscent of \\"Le Onde.\\")  Although strictly not a piano solo album, piano definitely predominates, with the strings and occasional electronica providing a subtle accompaniment.  The exceptions are \\"Underwood,\\" where the violin (played gorgeously by Daniel Hope) supplies a heartrending melody played above slow and sparse piano notes, and \\"Experience\\" where the strings weave arpeggios of despair and longing. Together they speak of heartaches past, loss, and perhaps hope.<br /><br />\\"Two Trees,\\" \\"Life,\\" \\"Experience,\\" \\"Waterways,\\" and \\"Time Lapse\\" are my favorite tracks on the album.  And if that sounds like a high percentage of the total album, it's because the album is so strong. If I had to pick a \\"worst\\" track, it would be \\"Newton's Cradle,\\" not because it is bad but because it has a dark and sometimes angry tone that requires repeated listening to appreciate.<br /><br />Pianists reading this review will be happy to learn that Einaudi has released a book of solo piano sheet music arrangements of all these pieces.  Most of the arrangements are highly similar, in not identical, to how they are played on the album, and most of them are quite manageable in terms of difficulty, easier on average than, say, the pieces in the Nightbook collection.<br /><br />I buy physical copies of CDs that I am particularly invested in, because I like having the uncompressed sound files as opposed to being at the mercy of mp3 or similar compressed formats.  However, for this album, I have both the physical CD as well as downloaded it from iTunes, for the compelling reason that the iTunes album contains an additional four bonus tracks not found on the physical CD.<br /><br />One of these days Einaudi will be the household name here in the U.S. that he is in Europe. This album could very well be the one to accomplish this.sical CD as well as downloaded it from iTunes, for the compelling reason that the iTunes album contains an additional four bonus tracks not found on the physical CD.<br /><br />One of these days Einaudi will be the household name here in the U.S. that he is in Europe.

B00992CF6W|5.0|okay by now nearly everybody should know what minecraft is I was never a huge fan but I tried it anyway and I said one thing to myself : how did I not know about this&hellip; I cant wait for the next update
B009G41CG2|5.0|I love it.  I love play Mahjong.  It has cool options that lets you change the way the layout is.  Again I love it.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This game actually not what I thought it was.  So, again here, I lost interest in it right away.  Thanks anyway.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game itself is awesome but for some reason the kindle (2nd gen) it won't let me send games to other people but I can receive games just fine
0345803507|1.0|What can I say about this three-some.. what a load of old rubbish.. Money for jam for the author.. clever woman.... Not a good read for young women.... I would suggest to all young women that they read D.H. Lawrence....... Lady Chatterly's lover... must more elegant.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I'm in mid 20's and grew up playing video games, so this was like a trip down memory lane.  I loved most of the old video game references, but there just weren't enough there for me to love it.  Had few good laughs, and think kids would enjoy it too.  Good rental, but not something I'll be buying anytime soon.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Keeps your brain cells going and is also great for leisure moments, especially when sitting in waiting rooms as well as sharing..
B004EPZ084|3.0|I expected a really funny movie.. it was OK but not as funny as i expected. rent but don't buy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters are endearing. The author did a fine job of developing imperfect people that keep their finer qualities intact in a changing world. I love the costuming and the view of pre and post WWI England.
1476734941|4.0|I'm turning 43 this month and have been reflecting back on my life.  I have not been good to my body.  I've been overweight much of my life and haven't been as physically active as I should be.  I've tried every diet in the world and lost hundreds of pounds over and over only to gain it back and then some.  I've been looking for a different approach to weight loss that is more than just losing the pounds to fit in my skinny black jeans but something doable that could help undo some of the damage I've done.<br /><br />I think that I've found that solution.  The FastDiet by Dr. Michael Mosley and Mimi Spencer outlines a truly revolutionary approach to diet, nutrition and aging.  The concept is so simply that even someone as stupid and stubborn as me can do it.  Here it is...are you ready...5 days a week you eat normally and then twice a week you fast.  That's it.  And the fast isn't really a fast but simply a 500-calorie day broken into two small meals.<br /><br />The book outlines in great detail the science behind the health and age-defying benefits of intermittent fasting.  There's exciting science behind lowering your IGF-1 and lowering your rates of cancer.  Intriguing ideas about alternative day fasting and lowering your risks for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and dementia.  The research and science on this approach to eating is in its infancy but early results seem to point to this basic idea:  That Which Does Not Kill Us Makes Us Stronger.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and the program is even easier to follow.  I highly recommend this book even if you're not interested in losing weight - but honestly who couldn't stand to lose those last stubborn 10 pounds.  This approach is more about holding off the aging process as much as you can while still enjoying life.
B007IUBU86|5.0|I personally don't understand why any of the negative reviews exist at all. I saw the interview of the band members on \\"That Metal Show\\" and I agree with Portnoy when he stated that there's not a weak song in the bunch. This is the first time that I've ever heard Mike Orlando play and I'm damned impressed. Russell Allen's voice reminds me of C. F. Turner of Bachman-Turner Overdrive and I love the pipes of them both.<br /><br />This album is a straight-ahead rocker and thankfully doesn't sound like the Yes and Rush wannabees that Dream Theatre and Symphony X are. It's addictive to the point of requiring a twelve-step program. If you buy this album you might wind up jobless and on the street or under a bridge with a pair of earbuds stuck in your ears because you're powerless over wanting to listen it and your life has become unmanageable.<br /><br />What the hell- buy it anyway!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addicting. And wonderfully contageous. Here's a household hint: if you don't want to do a cleaning job at home hand this game to your spouse so they won't notice the mess. OR get so involved in this game and you can simply ignore everything around you. Works for me!! ;)
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|If I want a T-Rex in my park I will need to pay $50 to have enough dino bucks!  The game is extremely fun but it is a bit ridiculous their pricing structure for the dino bucks which you need to buy some of the dinosaurs.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book gave me a whole different perspective on the wars we are fighting.  So sad that he has been murdered.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is a convenient app to have but i honestly like the full site version better. i guess its ok though.
B003Z49LYO|1.0|If you like depressing movies this is for you. If I would have known the story I would not have started watching and if I would have known the ending I would not have finished it. Deeply sad and hopeless.
B003JUGQ38|4.0|Just catching up on the series and so far I've been having a blast.  Just wish they would have had a better transition story between this Dr. Who and the next one in season 5.  Some things won't make sense with a new doctor that happened in this series.<br /><br />Spoiler alert but I'll keep it generic: This series there's an episode where someone from the far future recognizes the doctor in a very intimate way and thinks he knows her but he has no clue who she is and then she realizes they don't meet until his future.  Well, that will be a bit difficult now that he's changed faces... I supposed that just split off another parallel universe when that happened with the future being different than the other... ok, I can convince myself of that. =-)<br /><br />Looking forward to season 5 now.  BTW, some episodes are ridiculous, like the fat episode.  Get over it.  They're still fun.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Very well directed and fast paced movie. With a gripping story line there isn't a dull moment in the film. Keeps your heart racing till the end! kudos to Ben for an amazing performance, both as an actor and director.
B009POCG2C|5.0|This is such a feel good movie.  Adding in Justin Timberlake was a bonus.  Great performances by all and a great storyline.  Highly recommend!  Not a lot of nudity, sex, language....which is refreshing.
1439170916|5.0|There is no better insight. anyone in research, nursing, pharmaceutical industries, and all doctors need to read this. We need to learn from our mistakes in research.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great game! It helps to pass the time when your bored and also makes your mind work at the same time
0887307280|5.0|Of course, anything from Michael Gerber is excellent and over-the-top in value.  This book will be my business bible.  Buy it.  Read it.  Put it to action.  I'll see you on the beaches of the world.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|The interaction between the characters is great. The main character, Castle, is shown as a man with multiple levels of maturity. He is a responsible father to his daughter and yet he can be a man who doesn't want to grow up in a public setting. The other characters also show their human side, which is nice to see.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book really provides an insight into what makes us tick and what real love is about. Read it and fall in love with your partner again.
B007URVZJ6|2.0|It seems Amazon want a user to only use MS-Word even though other Adobe products are better for graphics. The says you can use the Adobe products but when you try to convert to Kindle it strips the graphic out. The book should, but does not address this.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|bought this for my grandaughter she loves it, would recommend for little ones to learn, very good would buy again
B0063IH60K|5.0|Once again, this is a great way to pass the time. Kids love to play or at leat learn to play Solitaire
1449325947|5.0|I've been in the 'learning' process for HTML5 and CSS3 for about four months now - I'm an old print guy who would like to move projects to the web. So I first bought the Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 Classroom in a Book so that I could find my way around using it as an editor and then I bought the 4th edition of Jennifer Robbins' \\"Learning Web Design\\" and she recommends this book for more CSS3 experience - and she was spot-on in the recommendation. I've also purchased the \\"HTML5 Cookbook\\" that O'Reilly has and feel that I'm, at least, at an intermediate level now - thanks to all of these treasures (yes, all purchased from Amazon).<br /><br />It may take me another year and one-half to get my website up and running - I wouldn't say that you should expect miracles just by going over the exercises in these books - but I'm able to 'do' more - and 'understand' more about what CSS3 is capable of because of this book.<br /><br />Five stars for being both thorough and easy to understand.
B002I0J5FG|3.0|I would be very careful in making the decision to buy ICO or Shadow of the Colossus. They are not video games for the mainstream consumer. They are highly illustrative of the fascination with horror, gore and darkness of the Japanese psyche. Both games also feature a very peculiar inverted conceptualization of gender identities. The male characters in the games seem beautifully feminine. The female characters, by comparison, can be conceivably hyperbolized as sea urchins onto which a confusing and unbefitting fascination is projected or beautiful angels that are given almost no place in the progression of a story that virtually centers around them. This ought to put off and weird out many Americans, were it not for the compelling artistic talent visible in both games. Japan is a land and a culture endowed by God with great beauty. That beauty, however, has largely been neglected by the Japanese people, except perhaps in the solemn remembrance of their ancestors and the horrors and tragedies that have marked their past. It is the unhealthy dwelling upon the negativity of that terrible past and collective human unconscious that has left the Japanese with a predominantly negative cultural inheritance in some of its modern expressions, such as anime and the video game genre, which includes ICO and Shadow of the Colossus. Such unique video games prevail in the expression of Beauty, but are highly problematic in that they seek either to distort, ignore or destroy it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This app is worth the purchase...I've done the Trial version and  enjoyed it so I can't wait to finish out the mystery!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book about a woman's journey is so well-written and explained. It should be required reading for all teenagers. But it's so applicable to life that anyone would enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my three year old grandaughter loves this game and is really good at it, would highly recommend this game to anyone
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such heartbreaking in this season! Excellent writing, impressive acting and never disappointing, love this series! Can't wait till next year!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is an excellent report of a Doc's personal experience (with a long period of coma) in another world!! As a &#34;non&#34; believer and transformation in the other direction to one convinced of the existence of God and continuing lifetime after death is very compelling and I believe happening to all people.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|As an aspiring entrepreneur, I have read countless books on starting up. This one is light years ahead of all of them. After reading The $100 Startup, I have started my business and have quickly gained traction in the market. If you're serious about bootstrapping your business, BUY THIS BOOK!!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|It is a great camera,if you like taking pictures of yourself only.Might be good for Skyping,havent tried it for that yet though.
B004VYYA2K|2.0|holds lots of dolls but like the Lego City Bin you can't pick it up when there are even a few dolls in in.  The case buckles.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my grandkids loved the movies so I knew they would love to play this game, recommend this for everyone to try
B00884GR0W|1.0|I was disappointed in this game, it kept freezing up and it was frustrating to get it shut down once it was frozen
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I love this app! Having all my passwords in one secure spot has been great. And you can backup an encrypted email or file too.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|This album will be a huge seller simply because so many people likely never thought Bowie would record another album again. Much like his personal finances, many speculated over the state of Bowie's health after his triple bypass surgery in '04. Some say he can't even make it up stairs anymore. True or not, why would anyone expect someone of means to make an album when he doesn't need to?<br /><br />But David Bowie does have something to say with this album and there is an edge to many of the songs which I feel is lacking in many of his recent albums. The title track, Dirty Boys, The Stars (are out tonight) all are strong tracks. If there is a theme to this album, I would say it's the pursuit of fame and fortune and what happens to people when they obtain, or fail to achieve it. I didn't expect to hear this in his music but there it is and it comes across well.<br /><br />The three bonus tracks on the Deluxe Edition should only be counted as one with two other tracks which sound incomplete. \\"So She\\" and \\"Plan\\" sound like sketches while \\"I'll Take You There\\" actually sounds like it would be a good single.<br /><br />I always linked David Bowie with Scott Walker. There is reason for this. When Bowie was struggling to make it in the 60's he dated a woman who was completely infatuated with Walker who was about as popular a pop songer could be. This came up in a Bowie interview and I guess it bothered him. Both covered Jacques Brel songs. Both artists crafted distinctive music in their solo careers. Bowie went so far as to record a Walker cover of \\"Nite Flight\\" on his \\"Black Tie and White Noise\\" album.<br /><br />The final track on this album, \\"Heat\\" sounds like it could have come from Walker's Climate of the Hunter release in the '80's. I mention Scott Walker because I hope Bowie will do what Walker does. Not tour so much as record. I doubt David Bowie will tour this album and pick up the write, record, tour and repeat routine again (something always suffers in that mix) but I do hope he will continue to put out solid music.) but I do hope he will continue to put out solid music.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I have read the book for more than 10 times now. I love the story, the character, how the Author presented the story in her matter to the fact, with no flowery words. Wouldn't advise it to the younger audience though (13 and under)
B009FZFONO|5.0|Excellent story, great acting, fantastic sets, perfect monster make up.<br />But, don't get too attached to any of the main characters . . . you never know who, when, where or how they will meet their end.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|My grandson loved this game when it was free and withiin minutes had the free game played, so I bought the full verision for him to play on and have more of a challenge.
B008F9E306|5.0|T.I. is the king .  Not much more I can say.  His albums always bring me from a dark place into a light and feeling much better.
B0027Z837S|5.0|While this is funny and the action is top notch, it is ultimately a movie about enlightenment, and waking up to the power that lies within us. Fantastic.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Joe does a good job of putting the modern world in perspective.  Its not a real hard rocking album, but there are a lot good solid Walsh tunes on here.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Beautifully written and thought provoking.  This was a lovely novel about an older gentleman who discovers himself through the otherwise simple task of walking.  Many of us go through the motions of existence with no thought or analysis.  Harold Fry's pilgrimage wasn't planned, but through it he not only discovers his own life's meaning, he assists others in finding theirs along the way.
B000RLFBP6|5.0|If you like--or can even tolerate--sci-fi, and you've never seen this film, RENT IT NOW.  It's that good...and the rest of this review will tell you why.  And even if you HAVE seen it, it might be wise to view it again before Hollywood releases its new version next year.<br /><br />I often wonder why Hollywood can't leave a \\"reel\\" original classic alone.  The original Robocop can never be equaled...and I wish they wouldn't try.<br /><br />The reasons?  There are so many.  Part of it's the perfect characterizations: Peter Weller is spot on as the tragic and triumphant Robocop nee officer Alex Murphy; Ronny Cox  and Miguel Ferrar are terrific as evil competitors for the position of senior president of Omnicorp; and Kurtwood Smith is delightfully malevolent as the crime boss Clarence Boddiker.  And on and on, through the entire movie.  The cast not only inhabits their parts: they wear them, even to the point of overabundance....and it's gleefully perfect.<br /><br />Much of this most likely is due to the imaginative direction of the Netherland's visionary Paul Verhoeven, who directed the classics [[ASIN:6305972885 Soldier of Orange]] and [[ASIN:B00006I04L Spetters (Widescreen Edition)]]  in his native land, and [[ASIN:B000IHL52W Total Recall]], [[ASIN:B000IDJNJ8 Basic Instinct]], and [[ASIN:B000MF4O82 Starship Troopers]] in this country.<br /><br />Working from the stellar script of Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, Verhoeven had the genius to create a frappe of social unrest, callous capitalism, political corruption, then mixed in a generous dose of futuristic eye candy and overblown violence, and finished with a pinch of religious overtones and--voila!--what appeared upon the screen was an absolute wonder to behold.<br /><br />The storyline is complex but easy to follow: in a worn-out, run-down and strife-ridden Detroit of the near future, young whippersnapper cop Alex Murphy is ready to prove himself as on the mean streets despite unfortunate timing: the rest of the force has become completely disgruntled and is preparing to strike.  He's paired with Anne Lewis, a solid female cop, but soon runs afoul of the mob and gets himself blown to smithereens before his partner's eyes.  There's barely enough of him left to be carted away.<br /><br />But here, the timing of his demise was perfect: a money-hungry executive of OCP (Omni Consumer Products) is trying to make a name for himself by helming society's answer to the over-burdened police force, and after a couple of false starts he resurrects Murphy as Robocop, a heavily-armed and -armored robotic machine who is touted as the first step to their \\"solution\\" to all urban woes.<br /><br />What follows is the free-wheeling melee of a city gone wild, with criminals roaming unchecked and politicians too eager to smile or scowl for the camera than earn their pay.  With a completely outmatched police force almost absent from their sworn duty to protect the streets, it is up to Robocop and his partner Lewis (who has begun to catch on to who might actually exist under all that metal) to save the city.<br /><br />One of Verhoeven's imaginative sparks was the addition of media-within-media: fake TV shows, commercials, and newscasts that pepper the film with potent black humor--the director claimed their inclusion was initially planned as mere comic relief in an extremely violent movie.  (In fact, he planned to include so much violence that it would be almost impossible to take any of it seriously--a la classic schlock like [[ASIN:B0096HKZ1M Re-Animator]] and [[ASIN:B000VYNYN0 The Evil Dead]]--but these plans met a major roadblock when the MPAA slapped an X rating on it and several scenes had to be scrapped. )<br /><br />But these inclusions are sheer genius, and provide a comical look at a society that is in near-complete collapse: toys that mimic nuclear explosions and TV shows heralding sex-as-money (the character in them is surrounded by women in revealing outfits as he cries \\"I'll buy that for a dollar!\\").  These, and generic newscasters who announce stories of tragedy and triumph wearing the same insipid smile; a heartless money- tocracy that engender a culture of feel-good politicians; and a sensationalistic media that promote vacuous drivel have all become accepted today as the norm.<br /><br />Whether intentional or not, Verhoeven created a brilliant movie that pinpointed a society so interested in falseness and artifice that our very hero is no longer human (point in fact: one of its commercials shows artificial hearts...with marketing companies printed upon them).  Even in 1987 Verhoeven predicted a society that would soon be promoting zombies, airborne drones and genetic manipultion.<br /><br />In fact, the only real failures in society were man's: when they made a proto-Robo the bot shot an OCP exec, and more than one of the newscasts carries reports like a laser satellite's misfiring that kills two ex-presidents and starts an uncontrolled forest fire.  And Robocop him(?)self is at his worst when he is shackled by OCP's directives (including a hidden one that could spell his second demise)...it is only when he breaks his bond to them that he can do what is necessary.<br /><br />\\"Robocop\\" not only went on to be one of the top-20 grossing films of the year, it also earned a favorable spate of critic's reviews and even won an Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing (as well as nominations for Film Editing and Best Sound).<br /><br />It also made the American Film Institute's \\"Ten Top Tens,\\" a compilation of Top Ten Film Lists in various genres--placing \\"Robocop\\" within the Science Fiction genre.  And this was no exception: the NY Times, Variety, and dozens of major film critics, have rated this film equally high.<br /><br />And its popularity gave birth to two sequels (of varying quality), two animated TV cartoons, a video game, and several graphic novel adaptations.<br /><br />The new Robocop is slated to arrive in almost exactly one year from the date of this review: February 7, 2014.  What gives me hope is not the acting pedigree--big names like Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson and Jackie Earle Haley could actually derail a story-driven movie.<br /><br />No, what I like is that key roles are being held by relative outsiders: Swedish-American  Joel Kinnaman, whose only big role came in [[ASIN:B007FH9GA6 The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo]], will be Murphy; and Portugese-born director Jose Padilha's only hits are Brazil's [[ASIN:B007WCZMB6 Elite Squad]] and its sequel.<br /><br />A year from now, I'll either be eating these words, or reminding people of this year's [[ASIN:B00A0SKFLG Total Recall]], with Colin Farrell...sometimes, it's best to leave well enough alone.at for a dollar!\\").

B008TMA1LY|2.0|Can not say much for a product that I haven't gotten around to letting my granddaughters play this. Looks like fun
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I'm currently reading this ebook and I think it's great. A friend recommended it to me and it's a great quick read.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Watch this video on a plane ride from LA to Pittsburgh, it was one of the best Bond movies, since Gold Finger.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It just got a little boring and maybe a bit more far-fetched than the previous two. I got it about 5 months ago and still haven't finished it.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|Mr. Beah writes an enlightening book for those of us with little understanding of the experience of war.  He tells his story in a manner that is compelling.  His matter of fact approach allows the reader to experience the world through his eyes while not getting mired in the horror.  This was a book that I found myself thinking about a long time after I had read it.  I highly recommend this to book groups.  It is a very important work.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I love stories about inspirational life struggles.  Cheryl Strayed's story about finding herself while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail is captivating!
B000F4RHB6|5.0|One album with all the best hits, can'y ask for anything better...great choice for me being a Huey Lewis fan
B00B780TAK|3.0|Bogus ending. Not earned within the story, just writers reaching to shock audience and keep them around for next season. Very disappointing, and not as \\"moving\\" as intended because of the blatant emotional manipulation. Running out of ideas ...???
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Particularly liked the mix of old and new technology - M's exploding fountain pen comment, taking the old vehicle out of mothballs, and going up against fully automatic weapons and a helicopter with a double barreled shotgun and a double barreled (how old school is that) rifle - exquisite
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I rented this movie at the request of my 5 year old grandson. He and I had already seen it at the theater.  It's a story that has a good message for kids. But also appeals to adults with its humor.  Great entertainment.  My grandson would watch it over and over if he could. It keeps his attention and like I said, sends a good message to kids.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00APACSJG|4.0|If you haven't read anything by Lois McMasters Bujold, especially the Vorkosigan series, this might not be the best one to start with. Bujold is a master of the Space Opera genre, with quirky, memorable characters throughout, as well as really great technology, both mechanical and biological. While Vorpatril's Alliance doesn't reach the heights of some of her earlier volumes, it's still a very readable book. In it Miles VorKosigan's cousin, Ivan, takes center stage for the first time. I've always liked Ivan, but in this story he seems just like Miles only less. I would have liked to see some of his funnier and more adorable characterstics. He's kind of like Romeo with no Juliet, a guy who doesn't want to  commit to anything that might get him in trouble, but who has a soft spot for little animals and when pushed into a corner will stand up for the Right. People refer to him as, \\"Ivan, you idiot!\\" So, there is the potential there for a great character, but it kind of got missed.<br /><br />«Apologies! I wrote this about Captain Vorpatril's Alliance (also by Bujold); but I accidently wrote it in the wrong book's field. I don't know how to delete this review, so I guess it stays. -- js»
B005EPKS8A|5.0|If you like the movie you gotta have this on your playlist.  The classic Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Johnny Lee Hooker, etc.  This is the music that restarted their careers in the 80's. This is some timeless music that's just FUN to listen too.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Enjoy it, when I have idle time.<br />It show your high score<br />keep you playing more, more!!<br />Great for kids to play.......
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I don't really know what to say about this book and I fear if I start really talking about it that I will give so much away.  It has become one of my new favorites and I feel like its a must read for everybody!
B008BD9SI8|4.0|Mixing gritty,unpredictable characters with twisting plots set in a frontier,fantasy landscape.Torn between liking and loathing the characters in the same paragraph joe delivers again.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Although I grew up in the era of the SA forums, I never really browsed there and never knew Slender Man originated from there. I love horror games because I think getting myself worked up & being scared is almost as fun as playing the game itself. This game is exactly that. I'll admit that the other reviews of the game probably overhyped what I was going to expect, but bottom line this game gave me about an hour of fun. The graphics are very well done and the ominous sound effects are a nice touch. While playing, I recommend playing with all the options on & play on the night setting. This really helps set the mood along with the sound effects. Playing with all the options off & playing in the day setting makes it not scary at all. Half the fun is getting chased when you see the silhouette of Slender Man in the distance. Replay value is somewhat short though, that's the only downside.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|This is an amazing album.  The covers are imaginative and utilize all five members of the group really well.  My favorite is probably Aha! because it has some crazy high notes and is a lot of upbeat fun.
B00BESCJII|5.0|I was quite moved by this film. Just loved it. It's quite an emotional ride.  It's not at all the teen movie I expected.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I can't wait for the coin regeneration. I love it and I want more. When does the next edition come out?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this story, it was a nice, quick, and easy read.  It felt like a nice twist on the classic romance story line.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is the first time I actually shed a tear reading a book. That alone should tell you how awesome this book was.
B005JABU82|5.0|Este es un articulo muy lindo, armable. Se vera muy lindo junto a mis otros objetos de coleccion. :3 :3
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Great series! Masterpiece did another spectacular job with the acting, story, and suspense. I look forward to season 3! Excellent work
1455519650|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Michael Connelly is one of my favorites.<br />Couldn't put it down. It is a great escape book.
B000DZ7V7W|5.0|This is one of Nina Simone's more subdued mid-'60s LPs, putting the emphasis on her piano rather than band<br />Excellent choice if you re starting with Nina
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|OK movie, definitely a unique story.  Story took a little time to get rolling.  Probably wouldn't watch again, but not a horrible movie.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|This Cd includes Somewhere which is a great sonng. I hear my train a comin' is also very. The rest of the Cd is good but nothing to get excited about. This is for collectors like myself
B004TJ1GVK|4.0|I think this move was a great when it came out even though at time it seemed week but overall like the movie.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|very good quality. Really enjoyed watching this movie. Had watched Part two and needed part one to really get into the context of the series. Arrived in a timely manner and was packaged very well.
B000ID37RM|4.0|I only recently got around to reading To Kill A Mockingbird, and I knew the movie was famous but had never seen it.  The book came out in 1960 and the movie in 1962, so of course the racial question was a hot button.  The movie does a pretty good job, in a lot of ways, of presenting a condensed version of the book, but the book is about soooo much more than just the racial issue.  All kinds of themes are worked into the fabric of the book, and I am really glad I finally read it.<br /><br />Watching the movie after reading the book seemed the natural way to go, and I hope anyone watching the movie who hasn't read the book will then read the book, because relatively minor changes do shift the flavor and import of the original work.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I already own this movie and I purchased it for my niece. This is a great family movie. I would have rated it higher if the option to do so was there. I definitely recommend this movie for everyone!!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is such an amazing game. I look forward to playing & building my city everyday. I love the goals. Only suggestion is have it ask if you really want to upgrade when you select to upgrade.  I have accidentally selected the upgrade instead of route icon & was forced to upgrade when I didn't want to.  Also improve the help section to include help on all the options.
B00BHNR1KQ|1.0|The movie is dark , 2 ten year olds with a handycam could have made a bettter move ,, Long ,drawn out plot
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game and have played it often since I downloaded it. I would recommend the game to anyone who likes games of strategy.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|Great story, brilliantly crafted, kept me reading and thrilled through the entire book.  Hope there are more to come with Katherine, Dexter and the boys.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This was well worth the download, we are already getting lots of play out of this movie.  Nicely done Dreamworks.
0345803485|5.0|I have read all three books, and I love them. Of course, it is not the wold classics. But these are great  books for a weekend or vacation. They take us into a dream about impossible love with impossible hot man. I have read a lot of negative reviews, including bad language, sadism, pedophilia and violence again women. To be honest I don't see it in these books:<br />- the language- yes, it is not Shakespeare language, but English is not my native language and I don't think the writing was so bad, but I can't really judge it.<br />- sadism: everything happens on an agreement between two adults<br />- pedophilia: this is story about two adults with a normal age difference of 6 years. I agree, Ane is innocent and inexperience, but she knows very well what she wants and that there can be some consequences<br />- violence again women, there are some violence, but not from Christian against Ane  without her acceptance.<br />Simple forget all these negative articles and simply enjoy the great love story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is so easy to use and perfect to have on your phone .  I use it  as a source at church.  I like the ability to have different versions of the Bible available to you.  Easy way to have the Bible always with you.
B006HH5ZM8|5.0|Love Bowie and this is full of his talent and star power. I am looking forward to his new release.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This book is full of historical facts, but at times it seems like Follett simply gets too verbose.  I liked the first book better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great for stress relief even though it can be challenging.<br />The noise can be a little annoying, so turn the volume down or off.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|used this for my phone i can shop anywhere any time i like to .,so downlord it and have fun
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|They stick on the wall very well and make the room more vibrant with colors! The princesses are very cute as well. highly recommended!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Altho the historical drama is not as great in season 3 the characters have won my heart and it is a &#34;must see&#34; for me.  This is one of those pieces where everyone who has a hand in the creation has gelled and excelled making the sum much greater than the parts!
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I am really particular about the books I read and I really enjoyed the first three Mistborn books. Characters are interesting and very well developed and the magic system is logical and believable.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|If you enjoyed the movie and want only the songs on the movie just as they are this is a great buy for you. My one and only complaint is that they didn't expend the mix up of Just the Way You Are and Just a Dream.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|this was a great concept that just has so much wrong in it<br />it loses all the fun by the end
B002GSXKN8|5.0|This collection should be an essential part of any persons film collection. Hopefully, people will know about this collection and buy it.
B0053KWDES|5.0|Absolutely amazing little amp to go with!<br />Plug to my iPad mini connected to my koss ktc75 and BAM! There is the sub bass feeling suddenly.<br />I adjust it to high grain as well as full bass 02 the headphones just turn to life<br />Highly recommended
B005723JSQ|4.0|A cute read, very current with all the text messages.  Some areas too far-fetched, but entertaining. Would like to see a sequel.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I enjoyed this book as a sequel to the Beautiful Creatures.<br />The book went though a completely different story line which was great since a lot of sequels are too repetitive of the original story.<br /><br />I was spellbound (excuse the pun) and could not wait to finish the book.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing this at the movies too!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to navigate and bookmark your verses. A must for anyone who reads the bible on a regular basis. I would highly recommend.
B00AEBBADG|5.0|My Friend loves this movie and has been looking for it for a long time so this rating is from her, she says it is really funny. I personal have not seen it yet. When I do watch it I will update this review.
B00B9366VO|5.0|I loved this movie!  I love Rock and Roll,  and i'm  hoping this movie will ispire todays musicians to start making music that pepole want to listen to for the next 20 years.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit from start to finish. A bit too much detail on the Philadelphia Eagles at times, but you'll love the psychiarist character. I've yet to see the movie but sure I'll end up disappointed as they never seem to live up to my expectations.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|yu can download any song you can emagine from youtube in a matter of seconds by just clicking download and watching it

B004XDYJRU|5.0|I LOVE this app, but the problems with the update are totally frustrating.  I have tried 10+ times and it simply refuses to install. I wouldn't be so peeved if I were using the free version, but it's the pro version that has a problem.  PLEASE fix this and go back to being my favorite Kindle app.<br /><br />_____ updated May 2013<br /><br />Thanks to the developers for working out the problems with the app.  It works perfectly now and I couldn't be more pleased.
1616614609|5.0|Netrunner has been entertaining me for a long time, since the early 2000's while playing the original version.  Now FFG has breathed new, much-deserved life into the game, producing perhaps a more balanced and mature experience.  I imagine this and future products will keep me happy for several years to come.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Oliver Stone is awesome.  Great cast, and movie from start to fininsh.  I would watch it agian, lots of action.
B005VR9328|5.0|What are you waiting for? Buy it! You can't go wrong here. My only issue with Undun is it's too short. Stop wasting your time reading reviews. Buy it...Undun is good for your soul.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I would have chosen 5 stars but I can't download the Rome update. It would get a 5star rating when I can update
B0049P1VHS|5.0|i had to get the first season of the walking dead. something new and innovative like this series i had to own.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I got this book about the time the Movie was making a big splash.<br />I am not much of a movie goer and wanted to know what all the big splash was about.<br />Besides have been on Victor Hugo in Paris.<br />The book is a long difficult read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I got hooked on this read early on.  You really think you know what is going on to begin with but all is not how it appears.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good read well done.<br />Quick to read enjoyed how the book read, recommended to others. Glad I had the opportunity to read the book.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|follows the graphic novel and delivers. loved the superman parts and animation. good buy if you like the dark knight series.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great book I really enjoyed them but I wish them would of talked a little more about there family life about how he is dealing with fatherhood
B000LC3IDI|5.0|i now have the whole collection on dvd. i love the saw movies. great action-horror movies. beats the horror movies i grew up with.
B000JZ68GG|1.0|I did not see it when it was released. So the chance to view it was good for me. But I was disappointed and hated it. It truly reflected so of the worst of that era.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|An awesomely heart-warming, charming, soon-to-be-classic film that REALLY got it's story line right.  Creating an animated smash that reaches out to both sexes AND was developed using the topic  of video games - a genre that has traditionally been male dominated - was no easy task.  However, wherever John Lasseter (Executive Producer) is involved, MAGIC happens.  Mr. Lasseter is truly one of my top ten heroes in the entertainment industry... and not just because he was my Mom's former boss way back in the beginning of Pixar.  Deep down, John is an eternal kid - just like everyone else I love and admire in my life - and John's love of all things innocent and child-like once again shines through in this latest, award-winning film.

B008G59IBI|5.0|If you're a green day fan then you have to buy their latest CD. Why even question it. They stick to their true sound and although they haven't done anything original with this cd, there are a lot of good songs on here.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded the game for my 4 year old she loved it,but froze constantly I had to delete the game :(
B003L77GGK|5.0|i have the rest of the seasons so, why wouldn't i want the complete sixth season.jensen ackles, need i say more,
B007REV4YI|3.0|I did enjoy this movie but I don't think it's as good as the previous two Daniel Craig Bond movies. It gets a little extra hokey at the end and about a half hour of useless could've been left out too. Take it for what it is and go with it!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Don't judge this album by it's singles. This is without a doubt Bowie's best album since the early eighties. Not only that but you will be surprised how rocking this album is. It has some of his best political lyrics ever, it's all actually thought provoking. This is an album only Bowie could pull off and he does with flying colors. Bowie is back my friends.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Good movie entertaining, a lot more gore than I expected so beware.<br /><br />Streamed it through my TV and it paused in the middle but came back after a few moments.
B008XOXGCO|5.0|I think the original CD will always be my favorite but I believe that #3 is an improvement over their 2nd CD.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|My family is going through this &#34;fracking&#34; on our land in eastern Ohio. I have also read some articles in Rolling Stone magazine by Josh Fox. It is really informative and well done.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|i have the first movie so, i had to get the second movie to go with it.love, love, love, my girlfriends.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this book several times - one of the few for me.  The quietly humorous narrative told by a spunky heroine who is not afraid to see her mistakes and change over time combined with the evolving love story gets me every time.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This was a lot better movie than some give it credit for. Sure it's not deep or complex or has a story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat; but it's just fun. Seeing all the games I played when I was a kid brought back some good memories too.
