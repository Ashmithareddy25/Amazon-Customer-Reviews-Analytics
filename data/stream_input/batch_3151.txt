B004RL9T50|4.0|I love the new trend in movies where we let people know that villainy is not inherent, but a learned behavior. It is a very funny movie, Will Ferrell does an excellent job of butchering words and making marvelous sound effects. Its on the excessive end of violent, which is the main reason why I haven't rated it a 5. That and the female character despite her strength and expansive knowledge is constantly needing to be rescued (though her kidnappings are very farcical.)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fantastic game that keeps you playing and playing. If you're patient enough and you persevere you will eventually get through some tricky levels without spending any real cash. Glad it finally came to the kindle!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|After two months, I love this watch. It lost one minute per week at first, but after a breakin period it's keeping almost perfect time. The main reason I bought a mechanical watch is reliability more than accuracy. Many times I've been burned by quartz analog watches that lose time as the battery dies, without warning. Quartz watches are inherently more accurate than mechanical, but the battery is a real weakness.<br /><br />I wear mine always except in the shower, so I have no trouble with it running down. A self-winding watch can't sit in a drawer, so this is an everyday watch. I'm used to having to adjust the date on months with fewer than 31 days, and it's easy on this watch. Those who complain about that apparently haven't read the manual. Same with the date language settings.<br /><br />Having the day of the week displayed is a plus. Otherwise, it's a great, simple functional watch. Big hand, little hand, numbers I can read that glow in the dark.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was crying and couldn't stop reading I finished it in like two days of nonstop reading. I am not a person to sit down and read a book. Me personally I am not a big fan of books for some reason but I love love love this book. It made me feel different emotions and I couldn't put the book down. Okay is my always.
B00C1040TO|5.0|There are many apps out there for tuning musical instruments. The problem with most is that they are limited to what instrument they work with. This app worked on piano, guitar, trumpet, and even voice. If you have another app that includes tuning, I wouldn't necessarily pay for this one. If you are looking for a good tuning app, however, this is worth paying for.
B0098XY5VK|5.0|Ha ha ha the funniest time management game ever. Why would he sell hot dogs?  It's a short free trial, so try it.  It's fun.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Not as great at the first two, but still pretty good.  Seemed a little stretched, like she was forced to write.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Kept me guessing throughout, which I consider essential to any suspense novel, especially when the primary element of the story is psychological depth. A slight detraction -- but not crucial -- were the jumps back and forth from the courtroom to the sequence of events of the crime and its investigation.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Great storyline - I'm sorry I missed the series when it was on prime time but I'm making up for lost time.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|This might be the Best thriller I have Reading in years. Dear Terry H - please write a new one. I Am Pilgrim
0425263908|2.0|after reading half the book I had to give up. I think alot of these 50 shade knock offs suffer from the same problem. They all try to copy the quirky writing style of the original. Their attempts fall short because they lack consistency. The quirkiness is so varied and random that every three pages I was throw out of the story by dramatically shifting style and characters. They are trying too hard.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Always entertaining  and thought provoking to read a John Grisham Book. He is a master and this book adds to his well deserved reputation.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|This was an awful letdown - NOTHING believable about it - as another reviewer said it was as if it was written on a whim and made up as they went along.  This show began to die with the Colin Hanks season.  Save your money and get the John Lithgow season - or &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;, instead, which was miles ahead of these last few seasons of Dexter.  I have never seen a show fall so far from grace - the worst &#34;finale&#34; I have EVER seen.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|What do you do for an encore, if you're the author of &#34;The Black Swan'?  You write this book, and show the world that second works can be both more important and better crafted than an initial Magnum Opus!<br /><br />i'm still working my way through this book, but the concepts he presents are already echoing into my designs.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game, better than the original.  Graphics are great.  I could play for hours.  Need more games like this for the kindle fire.
1742204120|3.0|The usefulness of this book depends on where you are going.  If you are sticking mainly to the known tourist destinations (Taj Mahal, Bombay, resorts in the South), it is fine.  If you are going anywhere else, this book is a miss.  I wanted to use this book to plan my trip to Gujarat.  It really falls short as far as this state goes.  And Gujarat is supposed to be one of the most well-off business-oriented states in India!  This book is less an &#34;All India&#34; guide as it is a &#34;top tourist destinations in India&#34; guide.  But then, there aren't really a lot of alternatives out there for India that are that much better.  Three stars, because it has no competition.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Well...all I can say is that this movie must be a classic keeper!  My daughter first made mention of it thinking that her daughter would like it.  I played it in my salon and it seemed at the time that my granddaughter was not very interested.  My daughter took the movie home to watch it again, which was several weeks ago, and my granddaughter has been watching it ever since!  A clean classic!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This chip is super fast. It is easy to install and has no problems running multiple large applications at once. It is fast as is, but easy to overclock and maintain stability. I would buy this again.
B0089LOG02|5.0|What a great read! I went from sad to happy and the writer kept me on my toes wanting more and more. I loved the character Vivian and I loved even more her bond with Molly. I highly recommend this book.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Amazing show, it's a shame it isn't on the air anymore.... but that's just Fox's track record when it comes to great shows. Wheedon has gone on to make many more good series, and for a while I hoped Fox would revive this like they did Family Guy, but alas
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Very good. My 6 year old grandson loves this game and he is a lot better at it than me. I think the video portion is very clever.
B0014JJ55W|5.0|Music is great for waking up mooch brother and wife, and tell them to get their own house losers losers
B00EXVZW6E|2.0|As much as I like hidden object puzzles, this one was not for me.  Basically, every level was same, with different background picture. Also, in my opinion, the developer should lose the conveyor belt or give an option to slow it down or turn it off altogether.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|THIS APP STUPID it has wolf's come at night they always kill you so don't buy this or Candy Rufus Games
0399255370|5.0|Absolutely my favorite new book of 2013!!!!  Immediately after reading it to the kids (with giggles in the middle), they wrote a note from the purple crayon to their little brother complaining about how he drops him on the ground at restaurants.  What a wonderful book!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|this game is so not awesome and I'd prefer skydoesminecraft and he's missing his BUDDER I heard but anyway don't get it
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|I really liked Eat, Pray, Love.  This book was tedious to get through and if it had been a library book instead of a Kindle purchase I never would have finished it.  Although the research and vocabulary are impressive, I found the book way too verbose and way too long for the very slow moving story line.  Characters - not likable, and I was not interested in the extensive text book botany.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Um this game is awesome as skydoesminecraft  but still I love it it's awesome as skydoesminecraft lol five star thank you
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game. The puzzles are solvable yet challenging enough to make you think. I just wish there were more levels.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I thought this would be the worst game ever but its not its amazing and i love it and dont be fooled by the other comments it awsome i had know idea a game could ne so amazing it is awsome i love it<br /><br />1- its easy and enjoable for everyone<br /><br />2- there are lots of fun levels<br /><br />3- its adorable<br /><br />4- it never crashes<br /><br />5- it is very addicting<br /><br />6- its only 99 cents<br /><br />Get it now <3
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|The game is great and all but with a few downs. One you have to pay with coins that you probably wont have enough so you have to use real money and two it takes 140 minutes to full recharge. But all in all its pretty good.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is do fun not only do my kids play it I like to play it to! So much fun! You will love it
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I loved this game. I couldn't put it down. Very smart. Every now and then the levels got easier. Which was a welcome change. Some of the levels were daunting. I loved every minute of it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I thought this book was very well written and from a very different point of view.  The subject matter was not the happiest, but you weren't bogged down in the sadness.  I really loved this book.  I felt like I was there with her and felt the enormity of her pain.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|This was a very entertaining novel.  This is a novel that you can just sit back and have a good laugh.  It is not very believable, but was very entertaining for a light read.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Some really good insight told in a way that makes it easily digested. Seems to lose its way near the end though.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book, although a novel, made you wonder how often similar stories did not happen back then.  I loved the way the author<br />weaved the two stories together.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A well developed storyline, told with clarity and style. The surprise ending was both a true surprise and a logical one
B001QWBM62|4.0|4 stars because I've only used it in stereo mode and Stamina mode. Stamina Mode is supposed to run for 11 hours. Perhaps it does, but if so, it can only be when it is turned on and maybe not even in record mode. No one records 11 hours straight, so I'm guessing that turning it on and off wears the batts down sooner. If not for that, I'd have rated 4 stars. In terms of clarity, flat response and transparency, it is excellent. The Auto Rec level is very smooth and doesn't sound as if has been severely limited and squashed. At rehearsals, before the whole band kicks in, the levels are quite loud, but it comes down quickly and smoothly. In terms of the other features, I cannot comment.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I chose this app when iGoogle shut down after Oct 2013. It's proven very versatile by giving me many choices of devices where I can use it, including Kindle. While I prefer the former for its wider range of gadgets, Feedly may actually be better in some ways for the flexibility it offers as a blog and news reader. If I were an easy grader I&acute;d give it the fifth star, and in time I may find that I prefer this app to iGoogle, but I'm not completely there yet as there are times where the different organization causes me to miss stories, and sometimes I believe iGoogle made new stories more visible.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Wow! This is some album! All the songs are 5 star, the production, the musicianship - all perfect. I must have listened to it 50 times.I've not done that since being a teenager, decades ago.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Great classic.  I reread this book as a senior adult and was amazed at all of the socialogical issues I completely missed as a student.  There is much to enjoy and also much to ponder as you realize how much has changed over the last 50 years!  I think that alone would be a great reason to read or re-read this great book.  Now I understand why it is considered a classic.
B00AYR2FOI|3.0|It's not inspiring in the least. The production and musicianship are what you'd expect, but it hasn't done anything for me and I've put it on many times hoping it would finally grab me.
B00FGM0JTY|3.0|I could see a number of ways this movie could be better. The shots of &#34;the guys&#34; walking along the railroad bridge were just way too hokey.
B00GHJ6BJW|2.0|But not a penny more. I guess this is what happens when you overconceptualize an album. &#34;Gypsy&#34; isn't bad either.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|All the women I know were talking about this book, so I bought it.  After struggling through about 65% of the story I gave up.  It was silly and not worth any more of my time.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|The game can be fun but I find there is not enough storage. And my game does not sync up between my iPad and kindle like it stated that it does.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|We rented this flick so we could watch it on the Auto Train ride to Florida.  It was a perfect choice.  Lots of fun and creativity.  Excellent performance by the whole cast.  It provided a satisfying distraction for my husband and me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Edge of your seat read. I enjoyed it on Kindle and now want to see the movie. Should be great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|if you love temple run you will love minion rush.it is just like temple run 1 temple run 2 or subway surfers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Superb ending to a superb series. As a Christian, I see much value in letting my kids read this. It shows the various moral dilemmas the persons have, both good and bad,  and noted, without saying it, that the Jesus of the bible has the best moral code for treating people right with maximum personal freedoms.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|That was the most amazing ending the ending of the epilogue made me cry a little bit too thank you for writing such a great series
B0092B125A|4.0|I am in a life pose class. I struggle with drawing the human hand. The book is described in classical style poses, but if you can be successful in drawing the hands in this book, it will improve your class handiwork...
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Along with A Time to Kill and Ford County, Grisham shows he's at the top of his game when writing about the people of his native Mississippi.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|Am thoroughly enjoying thi historical novel.i love the suspense and intrigue. The characters are well crafted.So nice to read such an excellent NZ story.
B00DYFCYSO|2.0|I became a John Legend fan right at the beginning when I first purchased his self titled first CD. I loved the hip hop influenced true R&B music he made. Then Once Again came out and it had a older slower feel to it than the first album, not really my cup of tea. But then Evolver came out and I was back on the bandwagon. Uptempo R&B with some slower moments for a change up, another classic to go along with the first album.<br /><br />Then comes Love in the Future. Another CD with what I like to call background music, in that it's good to play low so you can talk over it. There aren't to many moments on the CD that made me turn up the volume or hit rewind because I just had to hear it again. It was more easy listening at low volumes while I contemplated life in my head. Rarely do I ever just listen to a album once before I judge it but this wasn't to my liking and figured that out pretty early on. If you're a Once Again John Legend fan and not a Evolver John Legend fan this one may be for you, but I'm exactly the opposite.
072325804X|5.0|We purchased this book for our 5 year old.  He loves these stories.  The pictures are wonderful, as well as the stories.  This is a book that should be in every child's library.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Fun game. Challenging, different. I just started to play. Have not run into any problems.. look forward to it getting harder.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|FUN GAME!  But need a way to earn more crowns.  I don't care to buy some, but they are costly.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Great Tarantino movie! There was a lot of action, suspense, drama and a great love story. The music in this film was amazing too! I bought the soundtrack!
B002VECM4A|5.0|This was a great gag gift for my friends birthday years back he loved it I even got him to watch it with me lawl.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|If you enjoy hunting this game is a great way to pass some time. Although you do require energy to go out on hunts, it will restore over time on it's own, or every time you level up. The app also allows in game purchases to supplement your arsenal of weapons, but it isn't necessary. All in all a fun game.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Dexter is on the top of my list of &#34;must see&#34; dramas.  Being about a serial killer would make one think it is just another gory show.  But that is far from what it really represents.  There is good and evil, characters with faults and a sense of human values.  I just finished the final season on DVD and was blown away with the impact it had on me.  Sorry it is over.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Eventhough a lot of my friends had told me how funny this movie was, I was prepared to not like it because crude humor is just not my thing. However, I was surprised that it was very funny and not in the raunchy, cornball way I had expected. I CANNOT watch movies like Hangover, but I will buy this one after renting it on Amazon instant video. Yes, a couple places were down right rude, but they were funny too.
B005C7SXMS|5.0|This obscure little film from Wales is what makes being a film buff fun. It takes an indie director to think out of the box in so many different aspects. Casting, cinematography, lighting, location shooting... &#34;Graham T. Purvis&#34;.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|I just turned 63 this month (Nov).  Yes, thank you.  I was using a Bowflex and a sit-up bench for about a year before I had to downsize and no longer could afford to dedicate a whole room for my exercise equipment.  I searched and found this book and to my utter surprise and disappointment, I realized I had wasted a lot of time and money on equipment I didn't need.  Mr. Lauren has shown me how to sculpt my body in half the time with less effort.  I am amazed (I live in a state of wonder:) at the results I have achieved in such a sort amount of time - and I have just started!!!  I don't think I have looked this good in a very long time.  The reason I gave it a Four Star is because I had to THINK out a program for myself.  Oh, hell, I just gave it a Five Star.  Get it, do it, and you'll be happy you did!
B003G4W49C|4.0|A great story and well written.  Couldn't put it down.  My only complaint would be the length of the introduction, simply too long.  Please keep it short so we can jump into the story.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|The Kindle app can be a bit awkward at times, but overall this is a fun and addictive service. Quickly teaches a lot of vocabulary.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Absolutely amazing move that should be seen by everyone to see that there is hope in the midst of tragedy.
B0040I09RM|5.0|5 stars, need I say more. At first I thought it was crude and the brutality was painful. Now I am hooked and no longer squeamish at the violence. Although, I do divert my eyes if it is too painful to watch. Great writing, great acting, some of my old time favorites are part of the cast and now my new time favorites.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Good, but certainly not my favorite of Denzel's movies.  I much prefer seeing Denzel Washington play a more positive role.
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|It is a rarity to find a movie that is so superb, both in storyline and in acting. This movie is a must see!!!
B00BBW15R8|5.0|Fantastic Movie.  Not to hot about subtitled movies, but , this was worth it.<br />Rent it buy it whatever; you wont be disappointed.
1577316517|5.0|These ideas are a life changer for sure! I really enjoyed Eckhart's simple way of breaking down spirituality into lay person's terms so that it's easily accessible. I have already read the book three times and ended up buying my own hard cover book because I gave the other one away. I am planning to read it again this summer (southern hemisphere) and am looking forward to it. i get something new out of it every time I read it. it is handy to have his words nearby in the kitchen to reflect on everyday i the form of these inspirational cards. I thoroughly recommend them to anyone who has been searching for a simple truth.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game..I play for hours at a time.....Can't get enough of this game......The slot games are very addictive..Great game to play
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Exceptionally written. The author keeps the reader engaged and wanting more. I think everyone should read this book, young and old.
0783229526|2.0|It arrived quickly and and everything appeared fine. But then when I went to watch it recently, it froze in at least 3 multiple locations. Thus, making it unwatchable.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock is by far the best one I have seen. It gives you , I believe, 5 clock faces, music, you can dim the clock face, you can have a 12 or 24 hour clock, it has a sleep timer, the weather.  The settings can be found in the upper right hand corner even if you don't see it. Also, be sure you plug it in, as the developer states, if you're using it as an alarm clock.  Love your clock. Let me know when you add a tv to it.
B003A6X0P8|4.0|The main reason why I like this CD is that I attended this concert when I was the ripe age of 13.  The CD is what I expected:  fairly good versions of some great songs.  Blackmore had left the band and only a month later the performed their final concert, so they were running out of gas.  If you are a Deep Purple fan, this is a document of where they were at this point in their history.  The versions are pretty good, but it's not &#34;Made in Japan.&#34;  Oh, by the way, if you find the guitar solo boring, I can still remember people sitting close to me joking about wanting to throw a tomato at Bolin.  Either way, I'm glad I was there, and I'm glad I now have the CD.
0525478817|5.0|I literally read this book in less than 24 hours, I could not put it down.. great story. A MUST read!!
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|This documentary is life changing! please never stop selling this video-generations to come must be educated,,.......god bless you! sell it worldwide
1401938906|5.0|A must read. Pam takes the basics of the law of attraction and puts it into an easy to follow book of fun experiences that you can do immediately. I loved every section of this book and her down to earth take on what everyone should know is available to them if they just slow down enough and try the experiments.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I really enjoy playing but I could do without the junctions throughout the game that I can't get through without someone else's assistance.
B001P4ESGC|5.0|Such a GREAT series!!  Easy to get attached to the characters and the acting is fantastic!!!  I highly recommend watching!
1932100660|5.0|For good health reasons.  Excellent advice here, based on intelligent and extensive studies.  I am almost becoming a vegan, after reading this, and advise all my family and friends to stay away from animal fat and animal protein, as much as possible.  Plants, fruits, legumes and nuts; they are all good and good for you.  The research on how animal protein and hormones affect the growth of cancer cells is very informative and startling.  Read this!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I enjoy how the writers have intermixed what it might be like in NY.  I have no idea of how it really is, but the characters portray, the power, the machinations, the opportunities in a nice mix of care, but not too much, of the sleaze, but not too much, etc.  The cast has been well chosen and together with the writers have made almost all the characters human and yet more than human, each with a touch of Superman whether its Donna, Mike, Louis, Rachel, Harvey, Jessica, or....
B005EI86JU|3.0|Like many other bargain hunters, my immediate response to the D7100's release was to buy a deeply discounted D7000. Then I searched for something to complement the user's manual. Based on the many glowing reviews, I thought that this was the ideal complement. I was wrong.<br /><br />This book's strength is in the professional advice it provides on menu setup and use of the camera controls. That goes beyond Nikon's user manual and is welcome. However, the advice often drifts into chattiness that becomes overly familiar and distracting. The author also attempts what become inane excursions into the deep Nikon past with references to what &#34;your grandpa&#34; might or might not have thought The only point seems to be to display the author's long experience with Nikon.<br /><br />The book is also strong in its discussion of the various menu options, but in fact the book does little more in this area than Nikon's user manual, and I can download the Nikon manual into iBooks for $0.<br /><br />Where this book is very weak is in its organization and prioritization of topics. Fully the first 60 percent of the book is on the camera's menuing system. Rather than highlighting those areas likely to be important to a shooter, and leaving the less important topics for later discussion, the author just marches relentlessly through each menu option in sequence, one right after the other, whether or not the menu option has any importance to the majority of shooters.<br /><br />This approach creates anomalies that were frustrating to me in my efforts to take the camera out and start shooting. For instance, there is no section early on that discusses what the various control dials, knobs, and buttons do. The author does eventually have a chapter on the exposure mode dial, but this is in the second half of the book and after an exhaustive discussion of the retouching menu. Since when did post-production come before shooting?<br /><br />There are other examples of such anomalies. For instance, if I want to learn the proper use of the bracketing button, I have to delve deeply into that part of the book that discusses bracketing menu options. The book basically tends to subordinate a discussion of camera controls, and actual shooting operations, to its preoccupation with menus. It has the look of a hurried rehash of the user manual to get something out on the street for enthusiastic users.  It is not a book you will want to live with for very long, though.<br /><br />If you are willing to be patient and search throughout the book for the information you need, then you will eventually find it in this volume. On the Kindle version at least, the table of contents and index won't be as helpful as you might think, so you may have to spend some time searching. If you want something that places an emphasis on getting you out there and shooting, then you are better off looking elsewhere.nstance, if I want to learn the proper use of the bracketing button, I have to delve deeply into that part of the book that discusses bracketing menu options.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|this move was the best superman movie i have ever bought  it was full of action and it was just AWESOME
B000G6R7B8|4.0|I really liked this watch! It is a great looking watch! Unfortunately, it doesn't handle much. You can't really have the thing around water at all. The manual basically says to be careful while just washing your hands. Also it isn't shock resistant. I was putting on a backpack and the bar that holds the strap in place pull out and the watch dropped off my wrist and hit the sidewalk from about 5 feet off the ground. I picked it back up and it looked fine. An hour later it stopped working. I think the spring inside broke, because it just can't keep time anymore. I will only work for about 45 minutes before it stops.<br /><br />Again, I really really liked this watch, which is why I gave it four stars, but you just have to be careful with it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|You Can only use YouTube on the chrome cast when using from my iPhone.. Apple TV is MUCH MUCH Better!
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|another excellent thriller by baldacci; i have read almost everyone of his books & with few exceptions rate then five stars; this may not be his best book, i did think grishams latest sycamore row may be his best & this book was not quite a good as that but a great read; two new characters for me, the male/female PI team of king & maxwell working their way to twart a complex plot made for a great story which moved along very well; for baldacci fans i would say this is a must read
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Dan Brown's books seem to have a certain formula they all follow. So, why do I keep reading them? I don't know, but they are addictive aren't they. This one does still manage to hold some surprises till the very end.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was truly mesmerizing. It has now become one of my top ten favorite books of all time.
B0084I9QLY|4.0|I've always loved this album but I've never owned it!  I decided to purchase the pictured vinyl; visibly it's great but due to the weight and graphics a muffling noise is audible throughout the album, it's very noticeable when transitioning to the next song.  The jacket is plastic and it's not as pictured; this was not stated in the product description.  I'm still pleased with the purchase, anything by the Great MJ is a great buy!
B00BQ1D91E|3.0|The album itself is really good but the pressing is lackluster. Sound is so so but the red vinyl is sweet and Ghost is killer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game.  Some levels can be very frustrating, but all in all it's very addicting and very entertaining.  Would recommend this if you like a challenge.  So glad that it's now on the Kindle!!!  All my friends are playing!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Quality of acting, story line and setting has stayed top-notch.  Can't wait for season 4!  Again, all free as an Amazon Prime member.
0385335989|5.0|This book does not disappoint…just like the others in the series.  Part of my collection now and will never part w/ them.  Even my husband read them all.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|This wasn't bad.  It kept my interest and it has some twists, but if you paying attention at all, nothing that should catch you by surprise.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I would have given 5 stars but I don't understand what the point of the points are if they hold no relevance.  If you get to a certain amount of points, you should get an additional life; this might be the case but I don't see any rules.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I  love  the way  Grisham  writes  and  this  one  is  one of  his  best  I  think.  The  story  holds  your  interest  and  builds  to  the  climax.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Beautiful looking movie but does have some plot/story flaws as well as some oddly distant and &#34;boring&#34; parts, but overall if you can get over these flaws and the &#34;borrowed&#34; look and feel from some past movies, then you will find this movie a delight and a joy to watch.<br /><br />Very big movie, and well made - I enjoyed it (I let the flaws go and enjoyed the scenery).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and watch in HD :-)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had to force myself to finish this book.  It made me sick.  Ana has three personalities.  The inter goddess was repeated over and over.  The subconscious same thing and there was her personality.  Why would she subject herself to pain??  I am shocked that people think this is a good book.  It's sick!!!  The biting lip was used over and over.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Is there a rule that a dystopia can't include a single noble or admirable character? Donald Maass the literary agent thinks all big books need at least one noble character. Dave Eggers writes brilliantly. I gave him 5 stars for that reason...but lacking in a noble character...the book itself is a downer and disappointing. I read it eagerly and feel it is a book that needs to be read by anyone interested in history of culture, social history, social media, our digital world...but you won't be able to cheer for anyone in this book... or cry at their loss.<br />So the book is plugging away with nearer to 3 stars and that's my bet why.<br />If the heroine needs to be stuck on stupid.... to enable the plot to unfold then we someone whom we can respect...and Mercer doesn't fill that bill either.<br /><br />Lots of roman a clef here...but you keep wishing book were a lot better and deserved 5 stars for more than just brilliant writing... witty writing... intelligent writing...<br />high on intellect low on emotion...<br />and main female protagonist is insufferable.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham was one of my favorite authors for a long time and then I felt like he had fallen into just grinding out books.  I read a review that this book was as good as his earlier books so I decided to read it.  I loved it and look forward to more books.
B007SGM084|4.0|I'm late in reading this series but was very impressed. I am glad I gave into all of the hype :)
B0090P0O70|3.0|Certainly a book you CAN put down (read it over about a week of nights) because of its old-fashioned flowery prose, with the taste  of &#34;assigned reading&#34;. Interesting though because of its iconoclastic historical perspective----- definitely not the same story as we know in popular culture, as seen in the Boris Karloff/ Gene Wilder movies and so forth. Prescient for its prediction of how science (&#34;natural philosophy&#34;) can lead to problems if left unchecked. Pretty good stuff, especially when considering it was written by a 19 year-old girl, who may have had limited exposure to the whole of society. Her own nature iseems to come forth in her characters quite a bit. Most of the men seem to have a very extreme artistic and histrionic nature, even Frankenstein's &#34;monster&#34;!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Felt so apart of Alicia and all aspects of her life.  Great balancing and emotional distribution from all angles of the characters.  Loved it.
B00ENXBUR2|2.0|This review is NOT about the movie, which I absolutely loved.  But it is about this packaging of the movie.  The stand is as cheap as it could possibly be, a poorly fitting piece of plastic that you shove into another piece of plastic, and then hope it holds up the incredibly heavy tin that all the movies came in.  Somehow, my reading of the product was that I would get this really nice shield and stand, but it's just junk.  And the odd shape of the movie package inside the tin means you can't keep it with the rest of your movies. (It's a large diamond shape, much larger than a DVD package from side to side, that folds out to reveal four disks.)<br /><br />Since I've opened it and it isn't a lot of money, I'll keep it, but if I could do it over again, I would NOT have bought this package, but instead would have gotten the regular packaging, about $10 less, for just the disks.  The giant can on the spindly piece of poor fitting plastic that falls over if you breathe on it is certainly not what I would call collectible.  Junk, pure junk.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I just felt so involved in their lives and enjoyed each episode.  They went so fast and included so much activity.
B00DZPVS9O|4.0|If you're like me, you<br />a) LOVE Monster Magnet, and<br />b) think their last two albums blow hairy chunks.<br />Sorry Dave & Co, but a crappy album is a crappy album - and when you've got two in a row under yer belt the future doesn't look so bright. But 'Last Patrol'? They friggen' got it right, minus a song or two.<br /><br />The future's looking a whole lot better now for Monster Magnet, and I for one am grateful.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Smooth flow and on point weapons. The environment and uniforms great. Times and objectives are very fair. Addictive game better have free time
0060936223|5.0|Excellent writing, excellent story telling, and what an interesting story, following them as they struggled to get their careers off the ground.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I have this on my phone and computer now my kindle and I love it since I run two businesses on Facebook this really comes in handy when you need it.
0385751532|5.0|I have the book and the DVD (film).  I'm a huge fan of John Boyne.  This is the book that made me buy all of his other books.  It is so beautifully written, with great detail.  And, what a story.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|This film gives a wonderful overview of the universal similarities of the developing infant across a variety of cultures and offers a glimpse into how those cultures influence the process of development.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this set. Absolutely gorgeous packaging and a crapload of bonus content. The menus are loaded with details of each specific movie and you can just spend your time looking at them. The quality of the movies itself is a HUGE leap from previously released DVD version, especially with Aliens. Would I have paid the original $70 that it cost? Probably not. Should you get it for $25? Hell to the YES.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using Pinterest on my computer, tablet, and phone.  It's a way to keep creative juices flowing by seeing cute crafts, awesome outfits, beautiful destinations, and just what my friends have seen and liked as well.  I recommend that everyone have a Pinterest page even if you use it just to look around and not repost things or make new posts.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Of course I had to read this to finish the series since I read the first two. It's quite different than the first two books plot-wise. I liked the first two better, but it's worth the read.
B002GYS1FO|4.0|This was a Birthday present for my husband who loved this music.  I personally love two of their songs - He was very happy with his gift.<br /><br />Adriana<br />from Miami
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This is a great movie.  If you have seen the play of Annie you will like this just as well.  I have seen both and just love this movie.  Its cute and funny with how the girls get into trouble and get out of it also and Carol Barnette is great in this.  Carol was so funny in her weekly TV show back in the 70's and part of the 80's and in this movie she still didn't lose her funny quirky self in this movie either.
B00EKXDVOK|3.0|Heard most of these before.... but still Barbra is a great singer so it was a pleasure hearing her versions.
B0086700CM|1.0|For some people they might like this game but as for me I don't like it at all. Its just not my type of game.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Beautiful Christmas classics sung by these 3 amazing young  singers.  Great versions. Love, Love, Love it!  Hope they keep making more music together for a long time.  I will buy everything they do!!<br />Adriana, from Miami
B005LAIHYU|4.0|This is a ok movie by itself if you haven't read the book to make more sense out of this movie.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really did enjoy the game I didn't have any problems with it like a couple people did so I don't have any complaints
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is an awesome movie!!!! If you have liked all the other super hero movies you will like this one too. I highly recommend getting this movie for sure.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Interesting and useful insights as always, but not as impactful as books like Blink, Tipping Point or Outlyers. Two words.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|This a great horror movie with a twist. It is better than what the reviews have given it. I would recommend this movie.
B000NA28I4|1.0|Defective recording.  It keeps locking up when playing.  No visual defects, no scratches, fingerprints or any other reason it shouldn't play.  Defective recording?  If I get another will it do the same thing?  Same issue on another Blue Ray Player.  Strange, what a disappointment.  I love this movie.  Liked the books better.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Awesome movie this is one of Brad Pitt's best acting parts he has had in a long time. In this movie he shows his family man side very well. Great movie I have seen it quite a few times. I would recommend this movie.
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|This game is beyond my expectations. The only thing I wish is that I could speed up the reaction time somehow in order to allow faster counter attacks. But overall, this game is actually fun and exciting and the graphics are cool.
B00164GDA0|5.0|Classic coming of age movie. True-to-life personalities. This movie draws you in, time and time again. I highly recommend it.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Eminem kills it on this album.  Reconciles all the wrong from MMLP. You will  LOVE THE WHOLE ALBUM!  You won't be disappointed.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|Fantastic book from Jason Fried on the exciting life of Remote working.  Our typical preconceived ideas regarding remote working is &#34;out of sight, out of mind&#34; or &#34;if I can't see them, they must not be working&#34;.  This book debunks those myths and share successes from their own company 37Signals.<br /><br />This book highlights:<br /><br />* Success is how productive you are, not location<br />* You can work from anywhere, anytime<br />* Measure success on project / task completion rather than how visible you are at the workplace.<br />* Have crossover times when all / most employees can attend meetings regardless of time zone.<br />* Work and Life are both important - not one or the other.<br />* Certain groups are more pre-disposed to success in working remotely - not every job can do this.<br />* Start small and build the program.  Experiment.<br />* Don't let geographic location restrict you from getting the best talent possible.<br />* Much more.<br /><br />I love this book.  The world's workplaces are exploring this concept more and more to support environmental sustainability as well as procuring and maintaining the best talent possible.  It is a quick read or listen and it is full of simple advice.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|cut energy reload time by half and it's a perfect game.  The graphics are incredible with an amazing infrared; I can't miss a shot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think it is really really cool<br />My favourite level is level seven<br /><br />I love love love love love love this game
B00G91Z8AQ|3.0|Stuff happens, superman flys around and saves the day. This movie was not worth $20. I should have just rented it from redbox for $1.25.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and listened to it on Audible.  The premise of the book is what made me buy it--the rest of the book kept me enthralled.  I love how the author slowly weaved all the families together.  Once the secret in the letter was read every chapter was amazing.  I could not believe the twists and turns this book took.  Because I was listening at work, I would find myself not typing, just staring into space listening.  Some parts were just shocking.<br /><br />There are certain parts of the book that were done so well, I will always remember them.  Sin smelling like Sesame Oil--everytime I smell sesame oil, I will think of this book.  The Compass for when you are lost.... very touching.<br /><br />The best part of the book was the epilogue.  I love how she tied up any loose ends and had the reading realizing that the choices we make change the ultimate paths we take in life--which we all know. But when she says if this hadn't happened so and so would have done this for a living...or if the coroner hadn't been sick, this would have been discovered.  It was such a wonderful way to end a book.  I highly recommend this book.  It was a great listen on Audible too.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|For free can't complain for free fun interesting leaves you wanting more keeps you thinking and using your brain. Hope more comes
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|This story first caught my attention because of the originality of its characters. Eleanor, the eccentrically dress, slightly overweight 16 year old with dry wit and curly red hair. And then there is Park, the sweetest teenage boy you will ever meet who happens to also be adorable, half Korean, and doesn't care about following the crowd. This two beautifully developed characters walk you through the greatest awkward moments, amazing banter,  and raw emotion. It was impossible not to root for Eleanor (and Park) throughout the story. The juxtaposition between the characters POV worked perfectly into the story. Why not 5 stars you ask? The end.<br /><br />You see, I could end my review there but that would just annoy you. You would ask... What about the end? What bothered you about it? What happened to Eleanor & Park?! I rest my case. Throw me an epilogue and I'll toss in a star.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|mixed this up with Pleasantville which i did not watch after i realized it was not truman show.  truman show still a classic.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|They were irresponsible with the ending. It was so unoriginal. The lamest car crash in the world. Death at 10 mph? I don't think so...
B002XD8KEU|5.0|because those were the days when jim carey could do no wrong......it is a brilliant show, and holds up well for its age.
B008469DGY|5.0|Great fun and totally addictive! I play often and I just love this game.  The game  is challenging but very cool.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Aside from the great Judi Dench and Albert Finney, the acting was serviceable, but not Grade A. Craig is a new kind of Bond, suburban and plebian, and lacks the swagger and panache of the Bonds before him.  His dinner jackets look like they were rented, rather than custom-made. A genuinely affecting M was the center of attraction in this movie, and whenever Dench and Craig appeared in the same scene, poor Bond simply melted into the background. The Bond Girls were probably the dullest collection of beauties since the beginning of the Bond adventures. The villain was genuinely frightening, but seemed patched together from bad guys of the past.<br />Effects were remarkable, however, if a little psychedelic; and gadgetry was held to a minimum, unfortunately. (There's a new Q in town, with all the charm and presence of a computer geek. He's not even ill-tempered.)<br />However, the producers know much more about their market than does an Amazon reviewer, and this movie broke all sorts of records. The Bond movies have entered a new era and will reach a vast new audience, throwing off millions of dollars for its backers, but the old gold-backed Bonds will always have their admirers.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Gripping!  Follows along the 3-4 main story lines in chronological order.  At times I get the feeling that Martin does not know where he is headed, but he just keeps moving on into new and unexplored territory.  Needs to get focused and working on the next book (or three), but bring things to a climax and finish off the series ...
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|It's all the Freddie movies,hours of nightmares in hi-def. Did I mention this is all of the Elm street movies in one collection. Enough said..........................
B007FEFLTO|1.0|Thin characters and predictable stories. Yawn!  Repetitive use of words and themes that quickly gets tired.  You do not get to really know the main characters or know what they are feeling or thinking as there is no real development of their personalities though the course of the novel.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|Can look out the window for more accurate info. I thought it had a weather forecast  and news. Only tells current conditions at weather station.
B000TJQ75O|4.0|It's been years since I heard some of these songs.  Great trip down memory lane. The songs I hadn't heard were pretty good.  Overall love the album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't think that I would like this game.  Everyone around me was playing it...so when it finally came to Kindle Fire I decided to see what all the hype was about.  I'm addicted!!  I love that it combines a match three game with a game of strategy.  Perfect!!  I look forward to any new games this company would put out.  Great fun for all ages!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is so good I would not put it down I read it from Sun up to Sun down
B0077EBWVI|3.0|It was okay. In some ways, better than the original, and in other ways, not as good as the original. Mostly about the same, but overall I don't think it was as good as the original.<br /><br />Spoiler alert! The rest of this review contains detailed descriptions of the plot.<br /><br />Better than the original:<br /><br />Ren being from Boston instead of Chicago. Although it was kind of bogus that he never once mentioned anything particular to Boston (such as the Red Sox, stuff like that), it somehow worked better to have him be from Boston.<br /><br />Setting it in the South rather than the West. Again, it just makes more sense that way, I think.<br /><br />Worse than the original:<br /><br />No good scenes of Ren doing gymnastics. What's the point of that plot element if we only see it indirectly through his dancing? The gymnastics talent was cool, and I wish it had been more evident in this remake.<br /><br />Andie MacDowell was nowhere near as good as Dianne West. But I don't really think MacDowell is a particularly good actor in the first place, so I was not surprised.<br /><br />Dialogue changes. Pretty much everywhere they changed the dialogue, they made it worse. There were a few good modifications, but the majority of the modifications made the scenes worse rather than better. For example, cutting the &#34;What did David do? . . . What did David do?&#34; line. I don't know why they cut that line--maybe Wormald couldn't pull it off the way Bacon could, or maybe they just didn't think it added anything--but it is one of the most famous lines in the movie, and it was just silly for them to remove it.<br /><br />The same:<br /><br />Kenny Wormald did a good job. I am a little biased toward Kevin Bacon for this role, but I think Wormald did fine as well. The girl who played Ariel also did a fine job. Dennis Quaid also did a good job, maybe as good as John Lithgow.<br /><br />Overall plot is fairly comparable to the original.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />All things considered, this remake is okay and worth watching for fans of the original movie, but just go into it with low expectations and let the movie exceed your expectations.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|this is a page turner.  I understand the story and characters are fictional, but we certainly get an uneasy feeling that the social and political environment depicted in the book is close to reality. We get a troubling insight of the North Corean's daily life in constant oppression and imposed compliance, and of the very difficult and impossible choices they must make on a daily basis in order to survive in such a warped and dellusional environment. It reminded me a bit of the dilemma in &#34;sophie's Choice&#34;,  where every/any choice has dire consequences. The author succeeds in creating an eye opener and making the reader realize that today there are still people who live in a world of illusion, coercion and deceit  created and imposed by a government. After closing this book, one cannot help but to take a deep breath and feel very lucky to live in a democracy.
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|I love this series however this was my least favorite book of all. Everything was just too convenient and too easy. Plus it was hard to believe that his associate was that dumb, naïve, or impetuous. Still a good read, but the bar for Pendergast books is pretty darn high and this one just didn't cut it. I agree with an earlier review this series works the BEST when it deals with the occult or strange phenomena, versus action
0425221806|4.0|I love the three way Love story between Nora, Travis and Einstein the golden retriever. ( sounds kinky, but it isn't). If you like Dean Koontz (millions do) you won't be disappointed.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is fun and has very cool dragons. I play 2 different Dragon games, and this one is much better!
B00EEPFLHE|4.0|The first thing that you notice about this album is the amazing artwork. Once you finish gazing at the cover and give it a listen you realize that Stryper have released their heaviest offering to date. It has all of the guitar tricks and rock vocals we have come to expect from Stryper.<br />Tracks<br />REVELATION-The best Stryper opening track since In God we Trust. I like it a lot. 9/10<br />NO MORE HELL TO PAY- A great Stryper song. 9/10<br />SAVED BY LOVE- Up tempo rocker, Nice guitar hook 8/10<br />JESUS IS JUST ALRIGHT- A cover of the Doobie Brothers classic. I like it but I feel it's a bit long. 7/10<br />THE ONE- Could this be the best balled they have done? I think it might be. 10/10<br />LEGACY- Great lyrics, I find the song structure and dynamic a little bit too predictable. 6/10<br />MARCHING IN TO BATTLE- Slow and Heavy, apparently this was written before the Roxx Regime days 6/10<br />TE AMO- This reminds me of Iron Maiden.(Not really sure why) A good Metal Pop song 7/10<br />STICKS AND STONES-A mid tempo rock tune. Michael could have done more with the Lyrics? 5/10<br />WATER INTO WINE- This is Eighties rock by the numbers. Could be from any of a hair metal bands of the time. 5/10<br />SYMPATHY-This will grow on you. It's the chorus that gets in your head and stays there. 9/10<br />RENEWED- Fast paced, nice guitar riff . Good way to finish. 7/10<br /><br />There is not a bad song on this album, although sometimes they are a little too predictable. It may have been better as a ten song masterpiece, I would have left off, Water into wine and Sticks and Stones. Having said that, this is a very consistent offering.<br /><br />Is it the best Stryper album?<br /><br />It could be.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Spoiler alert for the last sentence of this review.<br /><br />OK. I really liked it; great prose, spot-on dialogue, fully realized characters and a trip into places and people in US society I did not know existed -- though they are all around me. For me, quite a page turner. When I was done, I felt I &#34;knew&#34; the people and had visited the places. Very well written.<br /><br />The disappointment: I felt it was tied up in too pretty a bow at the end, suddenly making it feel less like a literary novel and more like a run-of-the-mill romance.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Cute game. Too difficult for my daughter to level up and get any &#34;good dragons&#34; without making the in app purchases.
B003B02O7I|4.0|The Testament had just the right amount of intrigue, interesting characters and a great setting.  It was more than wanting to see how the story would end, it was learning more about the location and  cheering for the hero.
B00C1040TO|1.0|Good thing it's free. It doesn't work on my kindle fire.  Bummer.  Who's gonna be the smart one to figure out that fix.
B00004XPPE|5.0|This is a very suspenseful movie about nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia. &#34;Fail-Safe&#34; is the term used to describe where American planes &#34;holding position&#34; in preparation of attacking Russia. This is a very &#34;edge-of-the-seat&#34; suspense movie, as to &#34;what could happen&#34; in real life. (Black & White movie)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books, and I couldn't wait to read this one. I barely finished it. It was a huge disappointment.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|Being from North Dakota (which has a large Native American population) it's great that the very important role Native Americans played during the war. By using their &#34;native language,&#34; observation was able to be freely sent over the radio to the military commanders. The use of Native Americans, and the role they played in helping to save lives, is largely unknown by the American public. This great film brings to the forefront this important role of Native Americans, and is a &#34;must see&#34; for everyone. (You don't have to be a &#34;war-buff&#34; movie lover to be enlightened by this movie. This movie is based on fact, not fiction! We owe the Native Americans a great deal of credit in the war effort.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I really do love this app! I've recommended it to several of my friends already. I'm using the Spanish section currently. I haven't taken a Spanish class since high school and the app is really helping me refresh and more importantly learn. The format is easy to use and incorporates several ways of reviewing words and phrases. You translate from Spanish to English, from English to Spanish, select pictures to identify words, and practice your pronunciation. I redo levels for a quick refresher and to help things stick. I haven't checked them out yet, but there are several other languages you can try. I suggest trying this app.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Only up to level 440.  It would be nice to have it up to level 500.  Now, I have to replay the ones I have passed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool game. Way better than temple run. It has cool characters and hoverboards and a whole bunch of other stuff. It s an amazing game.  5 stars
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book! A most satisfying conclusion to volume one and two of this trilogy. Everyone should read these awesome books!
B007EC27QM|5.0|great app. comes in handy more often then I imagined. the memory feature is great, a definite must have on phone or tablet
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read all three books back to back; these are stay up til 2 in thee morning kind of books!!!
0316067601|5.0|This book had me riveted for 3 days while I read it from cover to cover. It is the true story of one of the saddest days in SEAL history. We lost a bunch of great guys that day in the Hindu Kush. This book is a testament to what an awesome leader Lt Mike Murphy was.
B00DM11LV6|5.0|Beautiful love story, well written and the scenes are fantastic! The actors did an amazing job, it was a very real portrayal of love
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I have been listening to Dream Theater since 1992 and they never fail to astound. This album is absolutely awesome and have listened to it more than 30 times already. Illumination Theory is pure genius and beauty rolled into one. I would highly recommend this album to any Dream Theater fan or would be fan. It is worth the money.
B00EVW0SA0|3.0|I would of given it a 5 star but it used the Lord's name in vain. Other than that, it left out nudity and they get 3 stars for that.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|though frustrating at times this is a great game, love that I can now play it on my kindle too.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Action packed Sci-Fi adventure. Better than I had expected. Great special effects and non stop adventure. suitable for family viewing.
B000VS6R26|4.0|A GREAT STORY WOVEN INTO THE FATE OF THE TITANIC. THE MOVIE WAS GREAT FOR CINEPHOTOGRAPHT AND SPECIAL EFFECTS AND COSTUMS.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|Funny when it was new and is still a funny movie to watch. I recommend this move highly. Get it !
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|I enjoyed this game, the story kept me engaged.  The only issue I had was the game was over pretty fast.  I deducted a star for that reason.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Beautifully written!  This book is written so well it feels like I am watching a movie in my mind.  Makes me want to read any other works by this author.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again, there should be more stars to highlight than just five. The novel was tremendous!!! My husband and I own all the books Mr. Grisham has written, including the Theo Boone books.<br /><br />Weaving the substance of 'A Time to Kill' into this at the beginning brought things back to light and the novel became one of - leaving a comma at the end of a sentence - not a period! It was hard to put it down - always wanting to read just one more chapter.<br /><br />Personally, I am grateful that JG doesn't feel the need to use profanity in his works. I've never understood why that seems to be a necessity for so many authors.<br /><br />The problem now becomes when he will publish another novel for us to enjoy. Both of us have been smiling each week that we see this novel at the top of the 'fiction' listings of books, in our Sunday paper. Anyone who has read his work probably is as anxious as we are for another novel to be published.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I have been playing this all day on my Kindle fire 8.9 and have had no problems. Games is working well. The only problem I have is keeping enough crown on hand to expand my storage. I guess I will have to keep trying.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is a really great game its the best hunting game ive found on tablet this will blow your mind and blow your socks off
B00ENV1HPY|5.0|Great to have Mazzy Star back. They didn't go for any drastic changes from the sound we loved years ago and it still sounds great.
B0060D123K|5.0|This is one of my favorite versions of the classic.  Well, you do have to like the Muppets first of all.  I still have it on VHS (bought it when it first came out) but don't have the VCR anymore.  Since I now have grandchildren I want to be sure it's around for Christmas time viewing.<br />It sticks to the story.  Michael Caine is a great Scrooge.  The songs are good--very &#34;Christmassy.&#34;  Having famous Muppets play the main characters actually works.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|This album is AMAZING!!!!!!!!  Overjoyed and Pompeii...this album is so different with all of the harmonizing vocals and the beautiful music..........  Buy it NOW!
B006AN78XS|5.0|We are Woody Allen fans to begin with.  While his films aren't always favorites, this was super good..  He doesn't act in this one so if you're one of those who don't like the character he usually plays, this is an excellent one to see.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|not your average matching game., always presents a challenge and always something to do. only thing I don't like is the waiting for lives.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I cannot wait for the next book. It did start a little slow then was full force by the half way point.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This game is super fun!!!! One problem. The part where you have to tip the guy to keep him frok falling doesnt work because i have a kindle fire.... please fix./
B000SX8BXC|5.0|One of the funnest albums I've heard. The Dolly Parton duet was just a LOT of fun. Nothing like Norah's voice.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I lost my Finte mesh tipped stylus and needed to get another. I went with this multi-tip product. The tip is rubbery versus the mesh on my former one. It responds well on my kindle- which does have a protective screen on it. I love that it has various sizes as I at times need a finer tip. My only complaint, and one big enough that I went ahead today and ordered the Finte one I had before, is that it squeaks. Yep, it is constantly telling on me whenever I use it. I like to draw and do my puzzles while waiting in the doctors office... or just before I doze off at night. But there I am, squeaking away. Even though it is a faint squeak, I find it too annoying. Sorry.
B009POCG2C|4.0|I love a good baseball movie. Combine that with Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams and I'm a happy guy! It's a great movie about &#34;old school&#34; and &#34;sabremetrics.&#34; It's the discussion of just seeing numbers and then SEEING numbers. The dynamic between Adams and Eastwood is good. Completely unbelievable that Eastwood and Adams could be &#34;father/daughter,&#34; but... they make a great combo.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun &amp; addictive but I get frustrated when I'm out of lives &amp; have to wait or buy more with real money.  I'm not a real gamer, just want to relax &amp; have a little fun.  I can see having to buy advanced levels but not making you want to continue playing.
B00CZ7OC46|4.0|Concise and full of fact and attitude on not only how to implement remote working, but why their management style works to create ultimately better human effort (and improve the human experience of working)
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I HAD TO READ THIS BOOK FOR OUR BOOK CLUB.  IT WAS A GOOD READ AND DISCUSSION. AMAZING EXPERIENCE.  SEEMED A LITTLE UNBELEIVABLE.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I love this movie. If you need convincing, watch them out of order. Watch before Midnight and then you will be dying to see what the prior stories were.
B00846REIS|4.0|Very good book. I read the Fifty Shades before this one. I am on the second book now. I read Fifty Shades in three weeks. I read the first book of Bared to You in three weeks. I think it personally depends on the reader. They are pretty similar!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|it only gives u 5 live a day which sucks because I would like to have more lives but it cost money which is stupid
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have never felt the need to write a review for a book I just bought, but this needed to be a short and sweet warning to loyal readers out there. This was not like the first two at all. In fact, the whole book itself was a disappointment... Right down to the very end. Now that I think about it, I really should have finished this book within 7 days of buying it so I could have returned it for a refund. But no... The story was just too boring, predictable, and monotone for such a strict timeframe, it barely kept my attention at all. Mostly, that ending was ballsy, to say the least it was incredibly brave for her [Roth] and I cannot wait to see how she reacts to the fanbase and their high expectations.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Well worth the money for seeing Net Flix, Hulu, and videos on google.  So far the inclusive apps seem limited, but with google in charge I'm sure that will change.
B005HSL626|5.0|This was entertainment for the whole family.  Everyone from the youngest to the oldest enjoys this game.  It is one of those that you can't put down.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Worst movie ever....I had to stop half-way.  I do not recommend at all.  Waste of time.  Just absolutely terrible.  Pass!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a game that my granddaughter loves to play.  It has helped her with her motor skills.  Now she is teaching it to the neighbor's child.  It is challenging and fun.  I have to put time blocks on how long she can play.  We have since gotten Temple Run 2 and love it also.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|A must-have for any Breaking Bad fan.  Things really start to heat up in Season 4.  To say much more would spoil it for those who haven't yet seen this fantastic series, so I'll stop there and let the viewer be surprised.  I have all but the final set, which is currently on order.  There aren't many TV series that I'll watch several times, but Breaking Bad is well worth collecting and viewing more than once, because you'll catch little hints and nuances that don't have much meaning the first time through.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|My four year old son is in love with this game. He has absolutely got this one figured out. As for me.....well.....I love to play it.....sadly he is better at it than I am. Enjoy it everyone....we do all the time.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|It is only front facing.  Which makes it Inconvenient  to take a photo.<br />This is why I'm getting an ipad.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a great read not only for teenagers but also for adults. On the surface, the book tells the story of Katniss Everdeen, a nature enthusiast teenager residing in the poverty stricken twelfth district of Panem. Each year in Panem, the repressive government located in the Capitol organizes the Hunger Games in order to remind all of the districts of the uprising caused by the former thirteenth district. In celebration of the Hunger Games, the Capitol randomly selects one male and one female tribute from each of the twelve districts to fight it out to the death, with the winner being treated to riches and fame. At the Reaping, Prim, Katniss' younger sister, is chosen to serve as tribute. Without hesitation, Katniss instinctively volunteers as tribute and sacrifices her life for Prim's. Collins follows Katniss' journey to the Capitol in her mission to survive the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Collins' plot twists throughout the story keep the book interesting and the reader on edge. Additionally, she uses the perfect combination of realism and fantasy to keep the story exciting but relatable. As thrilling as the story is, the content may not be suitable for children of all ages. There are some scenes with vivid description of violence. While this adds to the effect the story has on the reader, it may be upsetting for younger children.<br /><br />Young adults aren't the only ones who can enjoy reading this book. Collins cleverly laces deeper meanings within each action that makes it an interesting read for adults as well. With each action packed scene of tributes slaughtering each other or actions of self-sacrifice comes an overarching message of altruism, repressive government, socioeconomic inequality, self-survival, and feminism. Collins does a brilliant job crafting each scene to invoke reflection and analysis, making it an enjoyable read for all.
B004Y6MIXS|4.0|I allows me to crack my own WPA2 to test for invulnerability as well as many other functions I enjoy this alot. worth the buy
B00004WEJZ|5.0|Well, who can say anything bad about Sean Connery or the 007 movies. My husbands collection is only missing one, which we expect to find on Amazon soon.
0805091742|5.0|This could be my favorite book. It's fun and entertaining like a medical TV show, insightful, and has helped me develop as a leader. At less than 200 pages it's an ideal way to improve your job performance.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is cool because it's by Disney makers:) I Love Disney:) The only thing that I don't like about this game is that it dosent always let you on the game when you want to get on because the sever is down or something... well that's my review.......<br />Bbbbbbbbbbbbiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyy:))))))
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonderful book!!!! Had me smiling, laughing and crying. I then read it to my 8 year old son, such great lessons in compassion, putting yourself in someone else's shoes. Opens discussion of how people are different,each person's role in standing up to bullying, but also how our indifference can be just as painful as the bully's outright actions. For someone who feels different from his/her peers and has been on the receiving end of taunting, the main character, August, is someone you can relate to and admire his strength and bravery in attending a public school fully aware of his shocking appearance and how his outlook helps him get through. Also, I loved the strength of August's family. This was a family who raised August to have confidence in his abilities and the belief that his appearance did not define him and showed him unconditional love. Thhis is a MUST READ!!!
B005544TRQ|4.0|It's a good story line with very interesting characters.  Although I have a hard time understanding the importance of being a Harvard grad, which seems to be the basis for the entire underlying drama.  But perhaps something like that is very important to some law firms.  This, to me adds to the questionable wisdom of the legal profession in general.  However, I enjoy the series and will continue to watch it.
B00942Y35S|5.0|Excellent movie with a great message for girls! Watched it with my young daughter and she loved it as well!
B004M3GDI4|4.0|I haven't had this for very long yet, but I'm already developing an opinion...  I am loving the switch design - I can imagine using it with moderate gloves on and I just like how simple it is to figure out what lighting mode I'll be in.  Already it is obvious that this will be my go-to light around the house for utility purposes.<br /><br />For outdoor purposes, it's a bit heavy, but will make a great around cap light for those car camping trips.  Especially looking forward to using the ability of this light to sit on the table.<br /><br />The rechargeable version of this light looked attractive too, but that would be yet another charger and wouldn't allow me to use backup AA batteries for those long trips.  For now, I'm using NiMH batteries with disposable lithiums as my backup batteries.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was recommended to me by so many diverse people,  I became intrigued and had to discover its appeal myself.  I found myself enthralled and literally could not put it down.  This book is both beautifully written and haunting.  Having lived through a similar experience approximately ten years ago, I was left reeling from the aftermath of reading such a potent and poignant story that resonated so deeply with my soul.  I highly recommend giving it a read and allowing yourself to be swept away into this story.
0553582011|4.0|I have been reading George R. R. Martin's books and have enjoyed them all, including this one.  The Game of Thrones series books have good plots and interesting characters.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Fabulous book. Like several other that Mr. Gladwell has written it was well researched, with a driven message of a greet idea can come from anywhere, or anybody. The Bitchers of this world would never understand the point of the book, but they should read and learn.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Another great collection of songs from Darius.  His songs just strike a real friendly and classic tone.  If you love DR, this disc is for you.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book is hilarious, well written, and sexy as hell. The author takes us inside of the man's point if view and it will make you split a gut laughing! I've never read anything like it! Very clever! I can't recommend this enough!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Great little utility for Kindle FIRE HD, very useful in determining how you battery energy is consumed.  Thanks smallte.ch  If you are having problems, this utility (or it big brother Battery HD Pro) will help you understand it.
B00433SVP6|3.0|I really enjoyed the Percy Jackson series and although I thought this book was okay, it just didn't draw me like the other series. I think it's the constant switching between characters who, in the end, are pretty similar to each other. There's just not enough variety with the main characters and the action takes quite some time to get into gear. I don't know, maybe it's just that he's writing them too quickly. It'd be nice if there was more thought to the story.
B00B5HQL50|1.0|I cared absolutely nothing for the characters which is not terribly important for a Bond film, but if you're going to spit in the face of the trope &#34;What did you expect, an exploding pen?  We don't do that anymore&#34; then you better have SOMETHING else that carries your film.  Many fight scenes were set in dark locals so the action was masked as were the terrible cut-aways on the train and market rooftop scene.  And the Borne-like plot line was so obvious and cheesy and the ex-agent turned villain has already been done in a Bond film too... so no originality, no character, no decent action.  I shut the dang thing off with 15 minutes left in the movie it was so bad.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game so much if I didn't have a limit of how long I could play I could play for 2000000 days.
B0093QHWLC|4.0|It's not a happy story, and lots of really bad things happen in it, but it leaves one with a knowledge of two sides of the story and a sympathy and area of respect for all the characters.  The people and situations seem real, but no one wants lives like these.  This movie reminds me of Faulkner's writings about the resilience of mankind.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This was a very interesting book, with perspectives that are not clear to most, but really helps you understand how things work in the world.  Gladwell's research is impressive!  I recommend it to everyone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love all the DiY ideas for furniture and natural cleaning our great grandparents used. As well as the history you can learn.A little bit of everything!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|CANDY CRUSH is a fun, challenging game--particularly as you move into higher levels. I like playing the game; however, I personally don't like having to pay money or impose on friends so frequently to get additional lives and continue playing. I know that the bulk of Android games operate this way, but I personally have a problem with a game that represents itself as being \\"free\\" but starts costing money as soon as the gamer has played a level or two. I'd rather pay for a game outright.
0307352153|5.0|Well written and informative book. It explains me perfectly. I would recommend it to gain understanding of the introverted personality.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|DIDNT LIKE THIS GAME AND THE CONTROLS WERE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO HANDLE SORRY,,, IT LOOKED LIKE A FUN GAME
B0034G4OZE|5.0|Watched this movie after reading the book by Ned Vizzini. Excellent book-to-movie adaptation. The actors are great and represent the characters in the book very well. This story isn't necessarily considered a &#34;comedy&#34; by Hollywood standards, but more so a drama with bits and pieces of heartfelt comedy thrown in.<br /><br />Zach Galifianakis shines in his role and, in my honest opinion, is the highlight of the entire movie. The blooper reels in the bonus features of this movie are hilarious and show Zach at his best in improvisation of his role.<br /><br />If you like heartwarming stories, those that are genuine and simple, I think you'll really enjoy this film. I would also highly recommend reading the book.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL CHARACTER I PREFER GAMES WITH EASY CONTROL FUNCTIONS WOULD NOT RECCOMEND BUT OTHERS MIGHT LIKE IT
B009JBWOU0|5.0|All 3 movies are excellent and beautiful works of cinematography at its best.<br /><br />Assuming you've seen the movies by Christopher Nolan, this particular dvd box set is great quality. It not only looks fantastic, but is made well and provides great protection for the 3 dvds inside. It also comes packed with a cool design book that shows art and quotes from the 3 movies, as well as tons of extra bonus footage and features in the dvds themselves.<br /><br />Highly recommend this purchase if you don't already own the dvds.
B005HSL626|3.0|ENTERTAINING GAME DOWNLOADED THE FREE VERSION BUT WOULD ALSO PAY FOR IT THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT OVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love the graphics. Like that I can upgrade with Hunter bucks. Have it both on iPhone and Kindle Fire HD.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|NICE! THIS GAME IS CHALLENGING AND ENTERTAINING I WOULD DEFINITELY DOWNLOAD TO ALL MY DEVICES IT KEEPS ME BUSY WHEN IM BORED
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant is full of pearls of wisdom for younger readers. The Divergent Trilogy, and especially Allegiant, should be required reading for Middle School students. Veronica Roth built an in depth fantasy world that is believable and mirrors the real world. The characters in her world are haunting and their struggles become the reader's struggles. They demonstrate one can overcome a less than desirable upbringing and prevail; that one can overcome crushing events and succeed. For weeks after I finished the book, I was still immersed in the story and the characters' struggles and triumphs.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|VERY FUN AND EASY GAME TO PLAY I DOWNLOADED THE WHOLE SERIES OF ANGRY BIRDS GAMES AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS VERY FUN TO PLAY
B00CXLQG0M|5.0|Very nice design for the young girls in mind. My daughter had been upset for years that her brothers had nerf guns specifically for them.  She was thrilled to have some come out designed for girls this year.  Got this for her 9th birthday, and she can now rival her brothers!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|GREAT GAME VERY ADDICTING LIKE THE OTHER POPULAR PUZZLE GAME WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
B00BAXFECK|5.0|A true gem, beautifully written, meaningful and, an immensely entertaining story. A story involving New York City, Las Vegas, Amsterdam and masterworks of art, is going to be either a bomb or brilliant. Fortunately for us it's brilliant! Enjoy!!
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|DIDNT LIKE IT THE CONTROLS WERE DIFFICULT FOR ME AND THE GRAPHICS WERE JUST OK I LIKE A MORE COLORFUL TYPE OF EASY TO CONTROL GAME

B0059XTV4Y|3.0|Edward VIII reigned briefly as King of Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the British dominions, and as Emperor of  India, from January 20 to December 10, 1936  He then abdicated in order to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. He was the only British sovereign to voluntarily give up the crown.  Seemingly, this wasn't dramatic enough for Madonna (who produced/financed the film).  Inexplicably, she jammed in a secondary, modern plot starring an actress with a face as expressionless as a suet pudding.  As a result, what would have been an absolutely charming, possibly excellent, film was ruined.  The actress playing Mrs. Simpson is heartrendingly good, but she has a pitifully short time on screen -- being forced to share it with the dopey modern heroine.  Why do movie producers do this? A recent film about Julia Child was similarly ruined by just such a plot device.  What a waste of two of the most interesting female lives of the 20th century!<br /><br />On the plus side, we do get some idea of Wallis Simpson's instinct for fashion and her scenes provide a visual treat for fashionistas..
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|VERY FUN AND EASY GAME TO PLAY I DOWNLOADED THE WHOLE SERIES OF ANGRY BIRDS GAMES AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS VERY FUN TO PLAY
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very intertaining. Character development was excellent. Plot was suspensful, multiple direction. Well worth the read. Grisham at his best, had me guessing how the main character was going to react and evade trouble. Feel good writing, once again, main character is vindicated. Take a chance and read this one it's very intertaining.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|VERY FUN AND EASY GAME TO PLAY I DOWNLOADED THE WHOLE SERIES OF ANGRY BIRDS GAMES AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS VERY FUN TO PLAY
B001NLL8LA|5.0|another great Reacher read. Continued entertaining writing. Even though I know most of Reacher's action is fare fetched, it still is hard for me to put the book down. This book is no exception. Child does a great job keeping his main character fresh.

B0021L8V0M|5.0|With a thriller like this one, I am afraid to cite any part of the film, since it might reveal something you are better off not knowing. Suffice to say, it is quite a well played action film, with complexities, heroics, dastardly evil ones, and general goings-on that make the movie seem just a  few minutes in length. Jolie is the Star in capital letters, with good support from the rest of the cast. The chase scenes stand high in the very tough competition in that area and the stuntmen (and woman) more than earn their pay. Yes, perhaps one's credulity might be strained a bit, but, never mind, its more fun if one simply believes and accepts. Watch it and see.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Nice,fast paced reading. Grisham scored a hat trick with this book!!! Can't wait see what he does next. Very exciting.
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|I thought this was the best and most realistic take on the beloved hero Kal-El (aka superman). There is drama, action and good acting.  I have no idea why this excellent movie got poor ratings.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|i bought this movie because I am a big fan of Michael Fassbender. He was PERFECT in the movie and honestly (because the movie storyline was kinda...off... in general) he saved it and made it enjoyable. :) I can't wait for the 2nd one! DVD and blu-ray CD works well. I didnt use the digital copy but I should have no problem with it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Excellent installment to a great series. How things will \\"turn out\\" for each character is consistently unpredictable. No \\"Disney happy endings\\" here.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Even though it is kind of like temple run, it is better. Now that it got updated it is better.
B00FXMGI0G|4.0|Very funny movie..This movie was better then the orginial one. Anthony Hopkins played a good part in this funny movie.
B00D48BT5A|4.0|This is pure Bryson, an eclectic mix of interesting trivia and major events and personalities. If you are interested in history and how things have developed in the not so distant past this is for you. A period of huge developments and world changing events is recounted in an amusing sequence of stories within the summer of 1927 and a bit either side.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|This was a recent selection for our monthly book club and we all agreed that we loved it!  This is not the genre that I typically read, but I enjoyed the author's writing style, storytelling techniques and plot twists/turns.  I could totally relate to this relationship between the two sisters.  However, the ending caught me totally by surprise.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|John Steinbeck is a famous American author, writing about people he bases on the area of California where he grew up.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great graphics. Fun and entertaining game. Enjoyable experience planning the placement of the items. Great Dragons.  Fun game Farmville meets castles and dragons.
B003H3IOLE|5.0|I particularly enjoy old classics from old Americana.  Learning how people lived with very little, and were happy, or trying to be. An accurate picture of life in the 1800's.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|great movie.  lots of fun.  have watched it more than once (unusual for me).  wish they would make another one!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Really liked the first two books in the series, but this book was all over the place.  Felt like a different writer.  I was really looking forward to the final book, but struggled to finish it.  I do recommend Divergent and Insurgent.
0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins outdid herself on this series.  well written, clear, concise language, fast read.  I had to immediately get book two after reading book one!
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|The app closes as soon as I open it, it is not working. This was a waste of money. not happy
0439023513|5.0|Suzanne Collins has done it again.  Clear concise writing style makes this a quick, engaging read.  Had to get book 3 as soon as I finished book 2 (this one)!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much. I play this game anytime I have some free time and it is highly addictive. Fast paced, fun and every few months they change the settings so it doesn't become boring. Love it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Definitely the series should have stayed on MUCH longer, so we could enjoy more of these!  Cowboys in outer space, what a great concept.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I picked one up at a local bestbuy and I love this thing! I'm able to play hulu and netflix on it. Today Google announced HBO Go so I'm excited to try that out. I recommend chromecast to everyone!
0439023491|5.0|easy, fast ready.  very well written and engaging.  Suzanne Collins has out done herself on this series of books.  have recommended to several friends
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Holy Cow!<br />Two seasoned war-veterans are living out some sadistic postwar fantasies in this film. The ending is redeeming but so was Travolta's goofy Slavonic dialect and manneurisms whilst he came off more like a big dumb Russian than a Serb challenged by the virtues of kindness and mercy. A good film.
B008ZVJE3A|3.0|Though it was clever, the one joke note of the whole film caused us to wonder why we bothered to watch to the end.
0553582011|5.0|I am totally hooked on this series. I am well into Book Five both enjoying and hating it. These books are full of surprises. One never kinows which hero, or villain, is going to survive. This &#34;Song of Fire and Ice&#34; is an epic fantasy wrapped in a mystery,  inside a romance , etc. I'm looking forward to books six and seven. Stay at your desk, George R.R. Martin!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book, great story. Loved the whole series, wish there were more like it! Reminds me a bit of the Hunger Games as it's set in our world but in the future where our world is not the same anymore.
B00138GZAC|5.0|I love this artist style of singing very much. I been searching for her music for quite sometime and thanks to Amazon.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved this book and the story.  As always Mitch Albom has written a treasure. This is definitely a keeper. you won't be disappointed!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very good but not my usual type of story.  Enjoyed it and read it 2 times. Haaven't gotten to the next book yet but will do so soon.
030759565X|5.0|I love the blog that this cookbook arose from and I love her recipes.  They are fresh, current, and relatively easy to make and they are so delicious and good for you.  The cookbook itself is beautiful to look at and lovely to read!
031623480X|5.0|Grain Brain is one of the best books I've ever read on improving one's health.  It's great information that can change your life.  My husband and I are following the recommendations and we have already noticed a difference in the way we feel.  I'm in the health profession and I have been sharing information from this book with others.  It's easy to read and there are menu suggestions and recipes.  I highly recommend reading this book and following Dr. Perlmutter's program.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Excellent story development.  Ending somewhat predictable, but left room for the next story.  Speaker is a pretty far departure from the ending of Ender's Game.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I've read all his other books.  While this one is wonderful and an engaging read I don't think it measures up to some of his others.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|I gave this movie a one star rating only because  there is no lower one available. This movie is a hopeless plotless mishmash that lacks any semblance of the adventure and wit of the early Bind movies. Pure junk.
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|I never had any issues using their Firefox extension but the functionality did not translate well as a mobile app.  I found that it would block ads on some apps but not for all apps.  It also seems to interfere with Amazon' s app.  I think it sends all web requests it intercepts to a server instead of using a local blacklist. So I would have to disable it to use Amazon's app.  I ended up uninstalling it because it was too much hassle.
B004CURZFC|5.0|My daughter has been reading the books series and loved the movie.  She only wishes the movie was longer and that they made movies of all the books
0780747550|5.0|Brilliantly written - he takes a horrifically deprived and sad childhood and infuses it with humor and hope, as seen through a child's eyes. There is compassion for the Da who works but then drinks the childrens' food away. There is compassion for the desperate mother who is trying to keep her family alive, and there is a sense of the love between these two ill fated young parents. The childrens' fates are dealt with matter of factly, and there is even humor throughout the book, in the typical Irish way. It's deserving of all the literary awards it has received - it's a masterpiece.
0307959856|2.0|Well, it's faithful to its predecessor and period and all that. Clever. But never mind...I just didn't care. And I am sorry, because<br />P.D. James has had such a long and industrious career. One has to admire the production of another book at, what is it, ninety-two.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's a very fun game to play on my kindle. If played a game like it on my desktop. I like the quests.
0307739961|5.0|I only with Mr. Larsson could have lived to read his reviews. I liked the whole series, and I'm looking forward to seeing all the movies with Rooney Mara.
1609611543|5.0|A very helpful and informative book!  Following the advice in the book I was able to loose weight on vacation and feel so much better!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was, quite simply, Grisham at his best.<br /><br />Not since his early works has he written this well.  Loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|There is nothing wrong really, I just do not find this as fun to play as other games.  I do not like to have to buy lives in order to continue.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Very well done. The author allows the North Korean defectors to tell their own stories, while offering a helpful western perspective that emphasizes the tragedy.<br /><br />My only criticism is that I wish there had been more information about the notorious labor camps.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Love the characters in this book!  I was a little apprehensive about starting it in the middle of a work week due to the length. My only regret is the lack of sleep because I just had to read one more chapter and next thing I knew it was early morning.
1594484805|2.0|I'm usually a generous grader, and most my reviews are positive. I think I got this when I was an undergrad. I don't recommend it. I thought it would be similar to Malcolm Gladwell's books.
B00F522C7C|1.0|Wow.  I was not impressed with this movie at all!  As a matter of fact, I was bored to death....and totally amazed at how bad this movie was!<br /><br />Planes seems to parallel cars - yet is not nearly as cute, funny or memorable as Cars.  First of all... it's WAY TOO SERIOUS!!!  This movie is totally lacking any &#34;silly factor&#34;.  I know, I know...there's no Mater, of course.  But that's the problem.  This movie NEEDS a Mater!<br /><br />The character in Cars are literally oozing with personality...whereas in Planes, they're not.  They are just cookie-cutter clich&eacute;s of characters.  I never warmed up to any of them, since they were all totally forgettable.<br /><br />Plus....the plot?  This movie is just one big race...that's it!  That's it!  There's no warm and cozy Radiator Springs-like story to break up the tedious race sequences.<br /><br />Tedious.  That's the word I would apply to this movie.  What a terrible word!  I couldn't wait for the movie to end!  Now I have read that some toddlers and younger children enjoyed the movie, which I am very surprised to hear!  I would think they would have all been bored and fidgety - I know my daughter would have been at that age!  Although my daughter is a bit older, she still enjoys a good Disney movie.  However, after watching only a tiny slice of Planes, she lost interest and sought out the computer.<br /><br />I'm sorry.  I hate to give such a negative review, I really do.  However, these are my honest feelings.  The movie isn't funny, at all.  Okay, maybe you sort of chuckle a few times...but that's it!  As for the characters...I can't even remember any of them, and I just saw the movie last night!<br /><br />My advice?  Watch on Pay per View first to see if your kids are grabbed by this bland movie.  Who knows?  They might like it - then you can buy it for them.  But I will warn you, as the parent, you will probably get a bit bored and fidgety.......longing desperately for Mater to come chugging across the screen!creen!
1452101248|5.0|Excellent cookbook, although I love &#34;Jerusalem&#34; even better. Nice pictures, and the recipes are compatible with American measurements and supplies. The pictures are excellent.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story lines delivered by a remarkable cast.  A Must see.  Better to view all three seasons in order to better understand the nuances.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love these books 😍😍😍. They are the best. When in the go you won't want to stop reading them
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Thanx to the creators. Love the challenge and colors.  Helps time fly.  Excellent.  I want to try other games.  Found the reviews so very helpful.
B004PYWRQC|5.0|Great movie if you're into scary movies and the occult I thought some scenes we're too fantized, but overall it's a great movie..
B00FOWX6NM|2.0|Buyer Beware! I put this unit right back into the package and returned it, mine looked used. I've noticed a few others making the same comments here! The case didn't live up to my expatiations! The company has a good return policy if you don't mind waiting weeks for your refund.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Fairly dull movie.  However, it illustrates the fact that reality is often different than what we are told to believe.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|The acting is brilliant, cinematography breathtaking, the music moving, the plot thrilling. This is a fantastic movie all around, Russel Crowe is at his best and surrounded by great co-stars. I could watch this movie over and over again.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|I bought this for my grandson who is four years old.  He wanted to watch it over and over again.  I made him his first cup of hot chocolate because of the scene in the movie that so dramatically shows the children on the train being served cocoa.  He loved it.  It is a feel good movie that really captured the imagination of my grandson.  I enjoyed watching it with him.  It makes for a good family experience and has excitement, a good message and the acting and technology are excellent.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Saw the recent movie and thought I'd try the book.  A good read.  Looking forward to reading the other books in the series
0895260131|5.0|Entertaining and informative read about the often troubling and frustrating interaction between the Western world and Islam. The author is often humorous as well as insightful in his candid views on how open and objective discussion of this issure is censored and belittled by interest groups, government agencies, and academics. An unvarnished look at the history of Islam and its founder combined with a reasoned explanation as to why the middle east is in its current  state of malaise.
B0034G4P80|4.0|If you are a fan of Norse Mythology and Marvel Comics, then take the dive into the world of Thor!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book kept me guessing from start to finish! I've not enjoyed a book this much for a while. Great read!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH<br />THE MOVIE AND READ THE THIRD BOOK<br />I REALLY REALLY LOVE THE ENDING OF THIS
B001BR7CZW|5.0|This is simply the best movie ever made and the cameos made by some of the greats of blues are awesome!
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Love These movies...You cant get a better trilogy.Great special effects,good story line...a little romance.The kids watched it 3 time.Must own.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Rose has had a tough life, what with having visions pretty regularly and being called a demon child by her mother. So when she sees a vision of herself dead, she stands up to her mother for the first time, has a day in the park to herself, and makes a bucket list of 28+ things she wants to do before she dies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when she gets home, her mother has been murdered, and the police suspect her. Now she has to figure out who killed her mother and if they are coming back for her. Good thing there's a hunky next-door neighbor to help keep her safe and fulfill some of those wishes. (#15 in particular)
B006OOHYIC|4.0|This game is quite addicting. I played it nonstop until I beat it, but I didn't continue to play it afterward. Once you get to the end of the game, there's not much to keep you going. Great the first time through though!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is perhaps the most readable book about the historical Jesus.<br /><br />It is an unblinking look at the religious and cultural scene in first century Palestine. It was a time of brutal violence and almost unrestrained messianic fervor. Aslan captures that feeling.<br /><br />Aslan also helped this reader understand why, of all the charismatic messiahs that lived in that century, Jesus legacy survived.<br /><br />The scholarship is extensive and sound. I recommend Zealot.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card a great writer.  A classic I didn't get around to reading until all in the media now because of the movie.  Love his character development.  I don't empathize with any of them but I know them well.  They are real.  Card has a real talent with this.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read. I couldn't put it down. There were a few slow spots but over all this was the page-turner I remember Grisham writing.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|awesome cat and mouse movie. the cast was superb.nice twists as the story prevails. humor is also present with great dialogue.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|I don't think I laughed once while watching this movie. But it kept my attention enough that I watched the whole thing.
B001KX50BK|4.0|One of my favorite movies, and now I can enjoy it on Blu-ray!! Yayy!  However, the quality of the video transfer for this film isn't as good as recent day movies on Blu-ray, however it's still a nice bump up from standard DVD quality.  Certainly worth buying a new copy if you already have the DVD format.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book brings back so many memories from my childhood that I couldn't put it down!  I hope they make a movie out of this someday.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Gorgeous! Funny, sad, A whole cinematic meal. Why must there be subtitles though? Surely there is a way to offer the French films for those who want to see the whole frame.
B008LXZEYU|3.0|I guess you have to be drunk to really enjoy this movie.  Now I see where some of the one liners come from in today's society.
B00CKOQC9C|4.0|This has been one of my favorite books since I was a teenager. Ray Bradbury has a writing style that is a pleasure to read. You can also learn a lot about writing.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great Movie!!! A good family movie. We have watched this movie several times as a family. Good clean movie. Love it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This Google Chromecast works well for my needs, casting YouTube and Netflix from my iPhone 5 to our portable projector. We occasionally hold a &#34;movie&#34; night and had previously hook the projector up to a laptop, but this handy device makes it much easier!<br /><br />Setup was a little tricky and it took two attempts with a full reset to make it work, but it has been rock steady stable for weeks now.<br /><br />The interface is fairly intuitive and works fine from my Chrome browser on the PC and from the iPhone app!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Such a wonderful story with the true meaning of family and friendship.  I have watched the series twice.  I only wish it would continue on.  You get so wrapped up in the lives of the characters, you want them to continue.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Everything Susan Boyle records is top notch.  j13 more words required.  Well it is a nice disk, she sings beautifully.  I hope this is enough.
B00C1040TO|5.0|All features work great. Especially like the metronome. Trying to get used to the layout having used so many plug in type tuners in the past.
B00C2C637I|4.0|Another great Ray Bradbury tale. One of his best and one of my favorites. Hey, the movie wasn't bad either.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Even my 3 and 6 year old kids have a blast playing it!
B00B1MJ02K|2.0|I don't care for the album but I will keep listening to it until I do.  I do have albums by Bocelli that I like so maybe it will just take some time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's a fresh look at watching a series that's not over sexed and overly vulgar, it leaves the mind to its imagination.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love following the people in this story. I know it is sci-fi but it is still a kick. The bad guys are varied and for different reasons as I found in season 2
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Very interesting plot and concept, well acted and suspenseful, with surprises. A couple of my favorite actors were in it.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|My favorite show of all time.  Nice to be able to watch it on Amazon Prime.  I have season 1 on DVD but its so much easier to pop it up on my computer or mobile devices.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read the whole series but somehow misplaced my paperback copy of this book, so I got the kindle version this time around. Haven't read the digital copy yet, but such a fantastic classic of the genre. Say what you will about Card as a person; he writes some fantastic, unique, complex, imaginative sci fi and fantasy (the Alvin Maker series is also astonishingly good).  Ender is a character who lives in your heart for years after you've finished the book and the secondary characters are three-dimensional and complicated, too.  (Bean!)  I did see the recent movie in the theater. While it did a pretty great job of telling the story of the book, there are some subtle character development elements that just can't fit into a 2-hour time frame.  Don't just run to the theaters; READ THE BOOK!
B00BXUG0KU|4.0|Another great CD from Eliane.<br />Glad to hear her pick up some standards.<br />Very good orchestrations on all songs.<br />Very enjoyable!
B001R6AW18|5.0|It's a classic!!! The blu ray edition is the best print ever! This is a timeless classic! and the price is right!
B008JFUS8M|2.0|Let me start this off by saying that I have not read any of The Hunger Games books.  Everything that has happened on screen during the first two in this installment is all new to me, and I have no insight into the source material.  I will also say that I did not like the first one.  It felt very...&#34;PG-Thirteen-y&#34; in every sense.  I thought the story was pretty weak, I found most of the characters unlikable (save for Woody Harrelson), and the action and it's direction were just deplorable - I have no idea how it received the praise that it did.<br /><br />There, I said it.<br /><br />I was asked to go to this at a special early screening and said yes for two reasons - one, I felt that I owed the couple who invited us because I asked them to see Arnold's big screen comeback earlier this year (The Last Stand), which they hated.  Two, I was willing to give this series a second chance, considering there was a new director at the helm and I thought that maybe the second would be better considering the world had already been established and we didn't need much in the way of what I call 'catch-up character development'.<br /><br />1.  The Cast Is...Blah<br /><br />Before I rip most of the cast, I would like to point out some standout performances.  Jena Malone plays a pretty insane axe-wielding tribute and she is fantastic.  She steals every scene that she's in and is definitely the most interesting tribute in the movie (and yes, I'm including Katniss).  Philip Seymour Hoffman is also fantastic, as usual, and Stanley Tucci is also great.  The rest of the cast may as well have been wet blankets.  Jennifer Lawrence basically displays two emotions the entire film.  Watching Peeta is like staring at one of the  mannequins Kevin McAllister controlled with rope to scare away the Wet Bandits for two and a half hours, and his lack of chemistry with Jennifer Lawrence makes their romance entirely unbelievable...even when it's supposed to be real.  It's eye-roll inducing.  Most of the other tributes receive zero back story and have no personality, so when they show up on screen and take an arrow to the chest, it has absolutely no impact.  They may as well be Foot Soldiers or Putties for the nonchalance with which they are dispatched.  The emotion that should swell in moments like that just were not earned here.<br /><br />2. It's Boring<br /><br />I came into this movie hoping that I would see a bigger, better Games.  I mean, we've got the best of the best competing now, right?  The winning tributes, going after each other?  It's like the All Star Hunger Games.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it takes about an hour and a half of &#34;PTSD/Let's Show You How Bad The World Is...Again&#34; before it gets to the games.  Once it does get to the arena, the action is basically non-existent.  It's mostly just sitting around in the jungle until something the arena throws at them happens - no hand to hand combat at all.  Aside from one battle with animals, I found this really, really boring.  By the way, most of the tributes from the last Hunger Games look like they could take most of the goons found in this sequel.  It's like sending our second tier NBA players to compete in the Olympics...oh wait...<br /><br />3. It's Filler<br /><br />This movie exists basically as filler between the first and eventual third movie.  It rehashes a lot of what happened in the first one, and ends with an expected cliff-hanger for the third.  I'm okay with movie cliff-hangers.  I mean, the end credits scene in Fast & Furious 6 for example left be breathless leaving the theater.  Unfortunately, this one just left me saying, &#34;That's it?&#34;.  This movie is basically a two and a half hour stretch of something that's normally done within the first three minutes of a futuristic movie via voice over.<br /><br />Even worse, I don't really care what happens to any of these characters, save for Johanna.  Why should I come back for the next movie?<br /><br />4. Forced Jokes/Bad Writing<br /><br />The jokes...oh, the jokes.  There are some really forced, very poorly executed attempts at humor in this movie.  A few jokes here and there made me chuckle - there's a fantastic elevator scene when we're introduced to Jena Malone that is great - but most fall very, very flat.  When one character is coming back from the brink of death, another character exclaims, &#34;You were dead!  Your heart stopped beating!&#34;...&#34;Well, it's working now.&#34; (audience uproars with laughter).  Maybe I just don't get the type of humor that they were shooting for here, but most of the time, the audience was laughing with things and I couldn't help but sit there wondering what the hell I had just missed.  I didn't expect this movie to be filled with knee-slappers, but I expected the writing to be a bit better than it was.<br /><br />5. The &#34;Columbiana&#34; Ending<br /><br />I have a problem with what I call, The &#34;Columbiana&#34; Ending.  It's a plan by a character that would only work if the character that it's set up for made that odd one in a million choice.  It would be like putting a pack of rabid dogs with a taste for flesh into a van in a parking garage with about fifty cars and hoping that the bad guy not only chooses to drive away from the scene, but also picks that specific van.<br /><br />This story 'ends' with one of those Columbiana choices, and it just doesn't work...at all.  There's a whole lot of explaining to do.  I'm okay with suspending belief to get the most out of a movie, but this one just asks me to be dumb.<br /><br />Needless to say, I did not like this movie.  If I had to pick a few good things out, I'd say that it looks pretty, that some of the cast members (namely Jena Malone) shine, and I'm really glad the 'shaky-cam' is absent from the first movie (the director is much more mature when shooting action).  However, when this series is over, I will probably look back at it the same way that I look at series like Star Wars - I guess I don't 'get it'.  There's nothing that stands out here - the story is mediocre, the acting is merely serviceable, and writing is pretty bad, and the action is boring.  It certainly doesn't seem to deserve the 90% it's got on Rotten Tomatoes right now.  Sometimes I think that critics are afraid to give movies like this an honest score, or they're too connected to the source material.<br /><br />I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if you liked the first one, you'll like this one.  If you didn't, steer clear.<br /><br />Final Score: 2/5ad Writing<br /><br />The jokes...oh, the jokes.  There are some really forced, very poorly executed attempts at humor in this movie.

B00B0LPYXG|5.0|DW played the part of the alcoholic pre recovery to a T. Very intense movie, both emotionally,  and the flight scene.  A must see.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The Nancy Drew books I read as a fourth grader were better written.  If I read the world &#34;clambered&#34; one more time, I was going to vomit. I realize that people don't read this for it's literary value, but come on now!  The plot was right out of a comic book.  It's hard for me to believe that anyone would want to read the trilogy.
B000LC55F2|5.0|With Nicolas Tesla played by David Bowie, and the mix of real magic and mystery, this is a taut psychological drama, an intimate picture of the magic's burdens.  Intimate and beautiful portrait of the London in a different age. Each viewing of the dark light behind the stage brings out a different edge of performing. . . Michael Caine guides the unfolding story, with Hugh Jackman in a more subtle turn, and Christian Bale as the rival.
B000IOM0WY|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over. I was pleased to find this on Blu Ray. I highly recommend this movie! Makes me want to drive a Mini Cooper, lol
B00A6C3JN2|4.0|I have used it for about 1 week.  Have programmed to use Bluetooth, serial ports, LED's, Analog inputs, i2c, and PWM.<br />All seems to work just fine.  However, there is on big caveat of this new Due board.<br /><br />First the good, it is fast compared to UNO, even Mega 2560.  The programming of this ARM based board is almost identical<br />to the Mega 2560.  You do have to use the 1.5 ARDUINO IDE which is still in beta as of now.  So, if you are comfortable<br />with the previous offerings of the Arduino, you will be able to program this realtively easy.<br /><br />Now, the caveat.  The board is 3.3 volt, and can easily be damaged by applying higher voltage to the inputs.<br />Another critical aspect of this new fast board is teh compatibility issues with the existing shields.  Most of the boards<br />that I have from 2560 are probably not safe to use with this board.  I have not tried some of the shields due to<br />the possibility of ending up with scrap Due.<br /><br />For most development, I will stay with 2560.  And if I need more power, I will move up to BeagelBone Black or other<br />offerings that are now being introduced.  The shields that Ialready have by and large cannot be used with this<br />Due.  Maybe at later time, this board will be more widely used and more shields designed for it.  But, for now<br />it is not ready for the prime time.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This was a replacement for one that I loaned out and it was never returned!  We love watching Polar Express! It is entertaining and heartwarming. We don't see enough of this stuff anymore.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|The Hunger Games is a novel particularly suited to young readers.  The characters are young people. There is lots of action and there is a love interest.  There is also the element of horror in that people in a situation of near starvation are manipulated into providing entertainment to the population with the expectation of the near certain death of themselves  to try to assuage their hunger.  However examination of the reasons and results of this situation are superficial and cursory.  It is a good read for entertainment but not for a deep insight into a civilation under stress.

B003TT2X72|5.0|A great movie on blu ray, and always fun to just kick back and watch. I had these on DVD, but they are so much better on the blu ray
B00881VLCE|4.0|good, it would be rated better only because I am limited by my knowledge of the use of the kindle.
B0062O85IW|5.0|I purchased this to help with questions I had. It didn't disappoint me! I have been able to find the answers I need when I look for them.<br />I would recommend this to anyone with Excel questions. In my opinion it is a must have for your reference library.

B00B7FOQCK|5.0|So.... the first device that was sent to me was defective.  I actually gave it a 1 star.  Anker support contacted me by the next day to ask to make things better by sending a new device, free of charge.<br /><br />A few days later, I received the replacement device and it's flawless.  I will absolutely recommend Anker products in the future.  Yes, I believe they sent me a defective unit, BUT they fixed the situation and I will be buying Anker products in the future.  Their support is very, very good.  I'm happy about this purchase

B001RIY4WE|5.0|I already had the 1st and 3rd Terminator movies on blu ray, and I just had to get this one to complete the set! It's always fun to watch these
0399255370|5.0|this book is absolutely precious and buying more for gifts. seems like it's for older children maybe 3 and above. love it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great series of books. After reading the first one had to have the second and it did not disappoint. In my opinion, it was as good as the first one. The detail, the suspense, and the believability of the characters kept me enthralled.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Not her best.  I found it inconsistent with the earlier two books and the end was quite disappointing and unnecessary.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This is the scariest movie I think I have ever seen.  It started off kinda lame, but that was part of what lulled you into watching it not expecting what was coming next.  The fact that it was based on a true story and that at the end during the credits it shows the people involved made it scarier even though the movie was over.  If you love horror/thriller type movies, this will freak you smooth out.  The blood and gore was kept to a minimum, the movie didn't need that to be horrifying.  I watched it alone and in the dark, because that's how I like to watch scary movies.  Big mistake.  LOL.  I recommend this highly, but I won't be watching it again.  That's how scary it is.  Don't let any kids see this, even though there's no nudity or much blood, it will terrify them.  Use your own judgement, but I would never let kids under about 16 see it.  I literally prayed after it was over as if I had let evil into my house.  I don't remember a movie that made me feel like that.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This little sharpener is handy. Not of the highest quality, but it doesn't need to be, it is more geared towards a quick sharpening on the go. I keep this in my car because it is small and easy to store. For the price, I don't think it can be beat. I would recommend.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|This is such a good movie. I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I  was very glad that I bought it! I highly recommend this!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I had never played this before it was happen chance I tried it. I enjoy playing and the fun task.
B00A135YUW|5.0|beautiful music. love it! Her voice and lyrics are heartfelt and if you understand and have every been there it touches your soul!
B005H9B44A|2.0|Due to the lack of plot, and subsequent lack of rising action, climax, and falling action, I was left feeling rather bored throughout and unsatisfied by the conclusion of the film. Where was the tension? Furthermore, the romance seemed tacked on as an afterthought, and Natalie Portman's character overall (unfortunately) came off as obnoxious due to her one-dimmensionality and redundancy. I had low expectations since I saw the Avengers prior to watching this film and did not like it, but even then, Thor left me wanting.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like it but you can not go past level 35 without paying or facebooking, which I do not do!
B00EBBQXZ0|1.0|This guy pretty much quotes Wikipedia and another book already written on the film. I want my money back. Talk about complete waste of time.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I love these movies, and I am so happy to finally get them on blu ray! I got them at a good price and the shipping was very fast. Thank you so much!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Loved it! I'm a Star Trek fan from the sixties. Benedict is great! You get to see his darker side.
B004G600A4|5.0|Tangled is one of our favorites. My 3 years old loves the musics in it. It came on time for her birthday.
B00DEFW998|5.0|This is a wonderful CD! This work is an amazing combo of voice and instrument. I listen to it all the time.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|I love this movie almost as much as my two year old.  He's always talking about turbo!  Has a good message in it too.
B007XNAPX4|5.0|Good sound and video quality. This is a great DVD, filmed in Modena, Italy during a time I consider Peter's best years. Orchestration is excelent along with the visuals, whcih are a great compliment for the songs. All musicians are very good and Paula Cole radiant and beautiful, gives a real good performance. The extras are great, especially the interview with Peter. I recommend this DVD for loyal Peter's fans as well as for starters. Very good compilation.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|An absolute must have if you like the mission impossible movies. I look forward to seeing them on my high definition tv. I had these on DVD, but blu ray is much clearer and they have a better sound quality as well. Highly recommend this seller too
B004H4XLRE|5.0|This is a very nice toy for the little ones. My three year old grandson said he wanted to &#34;borrow&#34; it from his cousins.....so I ordered him one.....and he loves it!
B008602KQI|5.0|creative writing and ok acting. This was a different kind of movie, great job on the screen play. Its a fresh look at a nation struggling with an oppressor and what the poor do to survive and overcome.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Glad they finally got the app...FOR FREE. Super fun and truly addictive. I hate the chocolates so you have to be smarter than they are :)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I little difficult to set up, but with aid of a friend it is, and I can take to beach and use it there too to watch programs and movies from my phone or Ipad.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The show is just exceptional. The writing is spot on and the characters are so real - each having its warts and wonders
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Being an ex vet of the Viet Nam era, I enjoy most books of true American heros . Chris Kyle , was one such hero who put his life on the line every day for his men and our country .
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I always love story by Hosseni…. he gives us an insight into the lives of people we often don't see.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|The case looks like it was used, with scratches. I didn't expect that. I don't know whether it is defective or just old. Very unhappy with this order!!!
B000IONJJ2|2.0|Like some of the Monty Python films, it was OK for part of the film, but it broke down into complete slapstick toward the end. I like humor with a little more subtlety, and there is nothing subtle about this film!
B008XG1X18|5.0|great ideas on anything you want or could imagine to learn ,look or do thanks from KY. keep it up
B004G600A4|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE!  This is one of the best children's movies out in awhile.  I could watch this 100 times a year!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|loved this book...loved the entire series. My all time favorite series....Karen Marie Moning is on an entire other level to anything I have read before.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|The author tells the story so well and you feel like you are checking up on friends and family. Enjoy the characters and the story line.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|What can you say? One of the greatest all time books ever written! I would at one time have never thought i caould be so int oa book written in the style this is written in, but once you get into it it holds you there
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love the game.  It makes me think. I look forward to getting home from work. I lose track of time.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|POOR POOR video performance. Motion blur extraordinaire. Get something better like a Tolu which not only works properly but as advertised
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|The Marshall Mathers LP2 is another in a long line of lyrical expertise from the best rapper in the game today. Eminem is testing his limits from both a lyrical standpoint but also a style standpoint. Whether reverting to a midwest tongue twist, stacking so many syllables it seems impossible, or sampling some unique tracks to create his beats, there is rarely a flaw on this album.<br />However one of those flaws is the newest Rihanna duet, as neither seemed particularly enthralled with the track and it came across as a label decision.<br />Overall this album shows a great deal of humility from Em, but also sees him in a better place. He's still hungry, his humor has returned, and he proves again that no one in the game today is touching him.<br /><br />Personal Track Suggestions: 1) Bad Guy 6) Legacy 9) Rap God 15) Headlights 16) Evil Twin
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Played Castleville on my PC and loved it. Happy to see Zynga made this available for the Kindle. Now all they gotta do is make all the Zynga games Kindle compatible. Love the playing format of this game. Your able to do more than one thing at a time.
B005V20JKI|2.0|This game used to be my favorite, but after the update, it was really frustrating, because now, the levels I worked hard on are now locked... stupid update.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Superb in every way: script, storyline and storytelling, cinematography, acting. I love how it ties together with the &#34;old&#34; James Bond story. Judi Dench, Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes — well played!
B000JIHP88|5.0|My niece Nyla Rose LOVES this mobile. She is 2 1/1 months and is totally engaged laughing, babbling and following the flying animals! The music is soothing and she is content! We are both #WINNIG!
0385537131|4.0|The book was good but the ending was predictable. Grisham has had more twist and turns in other books and I expected more.
1594202273|5.0|This thriller proves that truth is stranger than fiction and more exciting, too. I've never been in the military but I worked in another federal agency for 25 years, and the dysfunction, ass-covering, territory-defending, and overall bad decision-making described in the book is entirely believable based on my personal experience. The research is incredible, too. Critics complain of the author's decision to split up the Damascus accident account into chunks, with political and military/strategic history interleaved between the sections. I found that choice to be highly motivating. It kept me reading to the very end. Skim or skip the geopolitics if that doesn't interest you. I did at times. It is astounding how often and how many ways a simple mistake or seemingly minor decision can lead to death, to a bomber loaded with nuclear weapons crashing, to something like the Damascus accident. To nuclear war?
B000FCKGPC|5.0|So many characters & so many turns & surprises. Truly engrossing!!<br />Looking forward to the next book and the characters that were not seen in this book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Transitions from scene to scene, moment to moment in time were not as smooth as in the first book &#34;The Hunger Games.&#34;  It was much easier to put this book down and go do something else; the captivation of the first book to just keep on reading was not there.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Preston and Child are to me what this genre of fiction is supposed to be. Fast pace but of worthwhile prose. Great characters starting with Pendergast and Swanson. That hard to put down quality that all the best books are made of. All of these come together for a great read after the Helen storyline. Man I love these guys!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A special read ... Grisham has relaxed into his writing style ... thank you for the fine entertainment, John. I am awaiting my next Grisham with much anticipation.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I forced myself to read this to the end because it's been so hyped and it seemed to the subject de jour, but I won't be wasting my time with books two or three. I found the storyline weak to the point of non-existence, the heroine idiotic and the hero - well, a complete ass with an inflated ego. As for the erotic scenes, I'm no prude, but there was just nothing particuarly erotic about any of it. Different - yes, interesting - no. Such a promising idea, such a flop.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Great book. Really practical steps to understanding and executing the Lean concept. Eric's book gives you the why you need to be Lean. This tells you how to do it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The author had the ability to tell you the outcome of certain events but still maintain a sense of mystery. You never knew for sure so he kept you reading to be sure of the actual ending of particular events.
0425263991|4.0|great story. the author didn't try to make the main character change to a nice, caring guy for everyone. it is move believable that way. I just wish the price was less.
B00FHB7398|1.0|I'm extremely disappointed.  Not only did I pay $2.99. But,  the game &amp; the reviews looked promising.  Because the game was so large, I had to delete almost everything I had. I tried to download at least 10 times. Not only did this not download but it completely froze my kindle fire to the point of factory reset. Ridiculous.  This seems to be happening more &amp; more often.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This I an interesting game.  I downloaded it because my daughter plays it through Facebook all the time.  I am still learning the game so this isn't a very indepth review.  I am lost when I click on something and I get all kinds of moves from it.  Hopefully, I will catch on soon.  Despite my lack of experience, I am still enjoying it.
159463176X|2.0|I loved the author's two previous books and was so looking forward to this one.  However, had to force myself to get through the second half of the book and almost gave up with 50 pages to go.  Am so disappointed, and can't imagine how there are so many 5-star reviews.  Unfocused and all over the place.

0061091669|3.0|Donald Spoto-Marilyn Monroe: The Biography<br />Harper Collis First Edition, 1993, many illustrations (b/w), 698pp<br /><br />&#62;&#62;&#62;An exhaustive portrait of Marilyn Monroe draws on previously unavailable sources and intimate papers to chronicle her private life, rise to movie stardom, marriages and lovers, and shocking death. Reprint.&#60;&#60;&#60;Publisher<br /><br />A delicate subject, a difficult task if you are not simply following the gossip trails. Two comments often made – “old book” and “boring pix” (though one could formulate it a bit more politely and to the point: a comprehensive book, in its orientation), it was pioneer when it first came out. Since then, we have many more, but most really worse by far, though with any pix found anywhere now we should be have a 100 percent nude collage.<br /><br />Sexy she was, but that is not necessarily identical with best when seen nude; intelligent she was, more so than originally realised (she beat all husbands’ levels, and at least evened out Arthur Miller’s). Vulnerable she was, uncertain unless when acting, pill-dependent, alcohol – a not unusual trail with a tough and demanding profession and business. One can but feel genuinely sorry for her.<br /><br />But her plus as an actrice is not easily rivaled, Miss Kane in Some Like it Hot is my most favourite  of her many roles, Billy Wilder’s film may even also be his best, and it certainly a Tony Curtis top. The film, unrelated to MM and unintended in a way, still gives the best operational Summary of the St Valentine’s Day Massacre…<br /><br />A really extraordinary actress. Spoto does her justice in this and many other ways. Agreed, a bit old and bit b/w, but still a well earned three stars. Don’t miss it!<br /><br />fbus 108  - Donald Spoto-Marilyn Monroe: The Biography, 1993, 698pp  - 22/11/2013
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Enjoy this album.  Can listen straight through.  There are 2 near the end that have a country feel, I would of left out personally but saying that even those 2 songs are good.  Getaway, the first song, is unbelievable good.  Amazingly in the album release interviews the group did not list it as one of the better/favorite songs of the album.  I've had the cd since it was first released and still listen to it, enjoy and appreciate each song.  Will give as gifts for the holidays.
1934030198|5.0|Yeah.  It's the Bible.  For beginner triathletes, I would recommend reading the whole things first before coming up with a training plan.  Some of the items make a lot more sense with info from later chapters.

B00F87ZUYG|1.0|If you want to watch a bunch of idiots, who are too stupid to do anything to even really try to stay alive, then this is the show for you.  They have been living in this prison for almost a year now but have done almost nothing to improve thier position.  I would have raided every home improvement center for a hundrend miles and been pouring concrete by now.  Not to mention hauling in wind, solar and regular gas generators for power.  Simple steps.<br />Speaking of raiding, You are driving around in the zombie apocolypse and you consistantly choose the small, hatchback hybrids?  Seriously?  I would be driving one of the hundreds of military Humvees, which have been sitting EVERYWHERE or, better yet, a good old Army 2 1/2 ton truck with a White multifuel engine.  Those things run forever, you can add armor, or, in this case, simple &#34;keep the zombies off protection,&#34; and the engince will burn anything flamable, even vegetable oil.  Plus they haul more than 2 tons of supplies and they sit up higher than a zombie can reach and can easily run over a whole pack of the things.<br />Instead, these guys keep picking the cheasiest &#34;whimpmobile&#34; that they can find.<br />After all this time, they still have not worked out a decent method for clearing a building or any other basic tactics.  Whenever they get new people in, instead of training them up to be a part of the team, they seem to try to ostricize them and then wonder why they have problems?  Plus, after living in this prison for a year, they have not even bothered to pick up any of the trash and then wonder why they have a outbreak of disease?  Wow, didn't see that one coming!<br />A friend said that all of this is to ensure they &#34;have challenges each week.&#34;  Personally, I would rather see the &#34;challenges&#34; shich come from rebuilding and clearing out the zombies.  Restarting some kind of civilization and making things work again.  Not the ones which come because of the boneheaded things they keep doing.  I cancelled my TV Pass.ey keep doing.

B007R11DKQ|3.0|This is an adult movie written at a third grade level.  If you're into that sort of thing, you'll like it.  If not, well it's free for prime subscribers and it makes good background noise while you surf the net.

The North part of the kingdom is now under Robb Stark.<br />The late king's son Joffrey (although we learn he is not really his son) is now claiming to be king of King's Landing .  The late king's brothers, Renly and Stannis, also claims this throne. - 3 claims for one throne.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|We &#34;bought&#34; this free app, and I went looking for it and it told me we already had it and to look in the library - but it isn't there. That is not convenient - I don't know how to load an app that isn't there : (
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I just finished this book seconds ago and never wanted it to end. I'm not even equipped to describe it but words like masterful and profound, which I rarely use, come to mind. This book is even better than Secret History, which is saying a lot. It's unfortunate that Charlie Rose had clearly not read this book when he interviewed Donna Tartt recently - he left so many questions unasked!
1573225517|5.0|I saw the movie High Fidelity shortly after it came out, and it has been a favorite of mine ever since.  But I had never read the book.  I had actually never read any of Hornby's books.  This month was my pick for book club and I decided that it was time that I read the book.<br />This is a rare instance of the movie being just as good as the book.  There are a few minor changes; changing the city to Chicago instead of London, and limiting the role of Marie, but in all other respects it was a faithful send-up of these lost boys.  Rob is drifting through his 30's on a raft of indifference and musical snobbery.  He gets a wake-up call when his girlfriend breaks up with him and moves out.  Rob starts reflecting on his life, and the women in it who he believes messed it all up.  We follow Rob through the next few months of his life, as he finally starts to take a look at himself, and take some responsibility for his decisions. It's both maddening and hopeful, hysterical and heartbreaking.  It is both my &#34;I hate men&#34; story, and one that gives me hope that the gender will one day evolve.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Who doesn't love Tom Hanks? He is one of my absolute favorite actors if not my most favorite. He can play any role but him as a computer animated character just makes this movie come alive like nothing else. This is one of the best Christmas films ever made and will always be a favorite in my collection.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|The thing that I love about A7X is that they get better with every album. Another thing that I love is that just by listening to this band you can tell who their musical inspirations are. If you listen closely to certain guitar riffs and solos and certain drum beats and lyrics, they ring of old school Metallica, Pantera, Megadeth, and Slayer. I love that. Great album!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Best Grisham book in some time. Captures the Deep South perfectly. The legalistics are believable, something you can't say for some of his books. He has an amazing ability to tease you with the ending only to find out you were wrong or right for the wrong reason.  Highly recommend.

B002BWP49M|5.0|I love all the Twilight movies.  I've even read the books and these stories are so intriguing, that it never gets old or boring.  It's not just about vampires or werewolves; it's about love, family, honor, compassion, faith, survival, strength and weakness, and all that we are willing to go through to be together and stay alive. The wedding scene is just amazingly beautiful and tastefully done, as well as the rest of it.  Stephanie Meyer is my favorite writer and her captivating stories come to life in this series.
0545586178|5.0|Great book, read it before the movie! At least the first one had so much more detail compared to the movie that you do not want to miss it.
B009HEP41A|5.0|This movie music is perfect. The movie is incredibly enchanting with the music acting as an important co-star. The interweaving of old Russian folk songs is brilliant. It sets an age precisely.

B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|Enjoyable.  Starts big, then slows down, then picks up again.  If you already know these likable characters, you'll enjoy this book.  Not quite up to his usual standard.  Not the same characters as on the failed TV series.

B008220C38|5.0|This treatment of Tolstoy's classic is unusual. It is enchanting with its stylized direction incorporating elements of ballet. The camera doesn't &#34;blink&#34; for 40 seconds straight on Anna's face while the train rumbles on abovd her. The music narrates the emotion of the scene. Turn off the telephone and let yourself be transported for a couple of hours.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Up to his usual high standards.  Jake Brigance is a great character.  Someone call Matthew McConahay and tell him to get ready to film this sequel to A Time To Kill.  This is a different story, in a different direction.  Includes the truth of the tension between blacks and whites in Mississippi without making you not like the book.  It is very good!
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Brilliantly photographed, amazingly funny, brilliantly<br />written (with no cliches or plot holes as so many<br />current films suffer from) - a real masterpiece.<br />If you love the Coen brothers, or Monty Python,<br />you will love this!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game kids love It and great time killer must play. Love costumes and keeps u interested never want to put down
0761172726|5.0|I get this calendar every year.  It's the only way I can keep up with everyone's schedule.  The stickers are a cute addition too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a wonderfully<br /> creative story. It's funny and suspenseful at the same time.  The whole family loved it! It was great
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Danzel Washington was wonderful. The plot is way too believable even if short segments were not so. Liked the end.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is so cool.  I play all day and all night because I want to have enough to get Mids
0143039601|5.0|Kerouac.  The Dharma Bums.<br /><br />After WW11, The G.I.s and others stationed in Japan after the war, brought Japanese culture back with them to the west.  Young people, many of whom had never encountered Eastern religion and philosophy, were curious, and like the young people in the sixties who were curious about Hinduism, 'tried it on', including Buddhist philosophy.  Some became serious adherents, learned the language, visited Japan and some just explored the new cultural ideas here in Europe and North America.<br /><br /> It was fresh, powerful, mystical, different. The Hippie movement of my own generation had its roots in the Beat subculture and in many ways was a continuation of it, including the exploration of Eastern philosophy. His observation that while Japan became interested in Western culture  and their men had taken to wearing suits, westerners interested in Japanese culture were climbing Japanese mountains, meditating in caves and wearing robes and kimono. The East and West were not only meeting, they were trying on what they found interesting and valuable in the other, even if they don't fully understand it, and even if they are only dabbling and getting their feet wet.  The point is and was the experience itself, and the journey, personal as well as cross cultural.  This was no doubt unpopular with the older folks who had not very long ago been at war with Japan and the clash between generations was significant.<br /><br />The German philosopher Martin Heidegger in the 1930s just before the war had traveled to the East and studied Japanese Buddhism and the ideas of the Kyoto School, at Kyoto University, including those of Nishida and Nishitani, and taught what would become Exisentialism there. Some of the Buddhist philosophers were as interested and excited by Western philosophy as we in the West were by Eastern, and soon we had a coincidence and an assimilation of both and each a greater understanding and appreciation of the other.  The Kyoto philosophers then came to the west to study with Heidegger, resulting in an East-West reformulation of religious philosophy and religion.  In a more personal fashion, this is what the Beats were immersing themselves in, finding their way, stumbling, and trying to reconcile the known with the new.<br /><br />Kerouac's exploration of Buddhism has been described as shallow, not only in some of these reviews, but even by some of his contemporaries, including Gary Snyder on whom the character Japhy is based  I don't think even Kerouac himself considered himself a serious adherent of Buddhism, but the path and the exploration however flawed, led him to pursue new ways of thinking and experiencing and a breakaway from the rigidity of conservatism.<br /><br />The writing, the insight and the perceptions in this book are exquisite and luminous. It shows how Western youth tried to reconcile the new ideas with their own cultural and lifestyle, and often these were at odds, such as the dichotomy between drunken parties and solitary meditation and contemplation.  The point is that they did try, and in the trying came understanding and knowledge, and in particular, self-knowledge.<br /><br />I've been meaning to read this for decades and finally picked up a copy at a yard sale, and although I admit I was puzzled by the first few pages, I quickly realized the depth and beauty of his writing, and the profundity of his philosophical insight.  The &#34;Dharma Bums&#34; are young, finding their way, often painfully, and asking the eternal questions we all ask or should, sometimes getting answers, sometimes perplexed and frustrated by it all. The journey of the Dharma Bums is a metaphor for the journey of the human spirit and like the avatars of old, Smith descends from the mountain after the glory and peace of isolation and communion with Nature, with a new vision of the world and his place in it.<br /><br />His is a flawed world full of contradictions, but it is a new world, and an exciting time in which to live, and for some, a break from the shackles of conformity.  This book is a reflection of that time and those experiences, warts and all, and I found is fascinating, poignant and memorable.iting time in which to live, and for some, a break from the shackles of conformity.

B00B7Y0206|1.0|Im seeing so many good reviews! But then this app gave my kindle fare a virus! I couldn't turn on my kindle till i plugged it in. i deleted the virus.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This dongle is the best! I own two now and really enjoy it. I just had to update my HBOGo and they've added Chromecast now so I can stream, Netflix, Youtube, and now HBO from my iPhone and iPad to my TV. Amazon needs to step up and offer this capability as well.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland is an exceptionally intense and enjoyable series. The intensity takes you mind off any problems of the day. The acting and writing are superb!! I highly recommend it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's additive ! But it's a great game, and challenging all at the same time .A lot of my friends are playing and enjoy it to.
B001G70M6S|5.0|This film is the best option around for the Polaroid Land Cameras. Also according to recent news, fuji is considering closing production for this film, so buy it, and then buy more so they realize that this great instant film is still worth producing!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Stunning voice.  Adele has few if any peers. I enjoyed the entire album, which is a rarity, at least for me
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game!!!! It's so fun! You have battles with vector and they're hard but fun. You need to get this game
B000CRQX34|5.0|Love this movie--a classic!  I really enjoyed watching this again and the extras are terrific!  Look forward to watching this in the years to come.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|This game is overrated! It's just like any other drawing bane not even worth 99&cent;! I could have used that dollar to donate to a charity and that is more worth my time!
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|This book is written as if it is happening now. Combining Google, Facebook, Twitter and Gopro cameras, the author creates an all-seeing, far reaching company.  Is morality lost? Privacy and the ability to choose is definitely sacrificed. Many interesting questions to ponder.  The thing I didn't like were the unanswered questions.  Ultimately, I didn't care enough about Mae.  She seemed too two-dimensional, succumbing to the Circle instead of being an individual. I didn't understand why.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|An excellent, suspenseful story which keeps you wondering and empathizing with the main character as he endures a bewildering and devastating series of events which lead to an astounding conclusion.  Highly recommended read.
B00G91Z8AQ|4.0|As far as reboots, this is a pretty good one. Cavill pulls off a believable Superman and the rest of the cast was spot on as well.  I think a little more character development was in order, but they made a commendable effort.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Like &#34;Downton Abby&#34; the cast of characters are part of an intertwined story.  I enjoy most England-type stories.  I also like the fact that it is non-violent.
B001TUPKAA|5.0|Great film for Jim Carrey! Creative and very funny! There are 2 unnecessary crude scenes, but overall it's thoughtful and has lots of big laughs.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|This is a stupid app its just to waste space and get you're money!  If you want an alarm clock use your phone for free!  Dont have a phone or an iPod? BUY AN ALARM AT THE STORE FOR 1 DOLLAR!  Waste of money!<br />Liked my reveiw? Check out my scribble nauts reveiw and many others!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I especially like the fun o meter.  I enjoy the challenge and love that I don't have to spend money to play unless I really want to.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Horrible ending to a great series! I am very disappointed in this book! I will not read it again unfortunatly!
B00005NX0L|5.0|Newport Jazz Festival is a unique look at a variety of great jazz artists, and it gives a sense of being there in a privileged place as a witness to the American art form in easy, early days.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So much fun and a bit addicting.  Glad to be able to play on my kindle even off line and when I connect it auto syncs my progress with Facebook.
0553582011|5.0|Having the first four books, book five did not disappoint.  Can't wait for the next book!  Kudo's to George Martin!
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|What a fun and different vampire story. A fast read that was very enjoyable. Good triumphs over evil in a new way.
B00FXMECS6|5.0|Very enjoyable film. Almost as good as the first Red. Great way to enjoy an afternoon of movie viewing. Fun!
B00000JZI9|5.0|Top notch actors, top notch acting, and the best Western movie I have seen since I was a young person.<br />It would have been higher rating if it had had more promotions.<br />A real &#34;Adult Western&#34;.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great puzzle ,it's a great pass time , I would recommend this puzzle to anyone who enjoys doing puzzles, very addictive
1423165691|5.0|I love the art in this book and the way it is laid out.  It covers many of my Disney favorites.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This is a great source for a diverse and stimulating collection of ideas and provoking opinions.  I am hooked and like it.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Great game.  Keeps you guessing as to what is next.  A fun game to play no matter what age you are!
B005HEPS6A|4.0|I simply love TNG. By season 3 the cast is well developed and there are far less of the &#34;what the...&#34; episodes. There is also starkly less copying of original Star Trek episodes. The show starts to hit stride here before the first of the inarguable classics - the final episode of season 3. The season finales from here on out are as good or better than the feature length films!
0143120581|5.0|As a mother of four, I enjoyed reading this book.  I'm aware of all the criticism it received, but I didn't read this book to take as gospel and I won't judge the author.  It was a great read with great stories, and had valid arguments and concerns for any parent.  I enjoyed it so much I purchased another one for a friend of mine that's expecting.
B004CLYKLI|3.0|It is a typical story of all parents who push their children to be better than they are. I know it was a very highly rated book,but<br />behavior of the mother in the book seems exaggerated.
0811875555|5.0|This is a truly beautiful book full of concept art and the final product.  I would very highly recommend it.
B0018M6J90|4.0|Fabulous ensemble cast.  Incredibly ironic, fun and witty.  Frances McDormand and Amy Adams shine in the presence their British colleagues.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever! I love the new Christmas at London, since I was born in London!!:) (I'm not kidding!!)<br />Hope you like this game!!!
0385351399|1.0|poorly written and totally over rated. I read continuously and haven't touched a book that bad in many year. And I like all Types of books
B00BGI086Q|5.0|By far one of the best series ever made.  I am huge comic, super hero fan and a fan of anything that is in this genre.  The writers, directors and actors are doing an amazing job.  If you love Batman, Superman or any of the Marvel, or super hero characters, I warn you, you will be addicted in just one episode.  Also, I was shocked at how many episodes they actually made for season one. Some times you get 8-12 at maximum. This season had a ton of episodes and each one, the plot unfolded and I became more and more hooked.  This is absolutely your next series to get addicted to. Enjoy.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|I liked the suspense throughout the story that had you guessing to the end. Watson has written a terrific book and I highly recommend to all genre readers!
B0026QC0TA|2.0|the sound  was no good. I tried watching it a couple of times and ran into the same issue. would not recommend it.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Love their music.<br />Greatvband. Everyone should have a cold play album.<br />Boughttbfor for my hubby but I love it too
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love the game except when screen freezes and you loose all tokens and don't get them back wish you could get more coins before 24hours
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Book started out well and held my interest. Plot just got more and more unbelievable. With all the drugs and alcohol in their systems, the main characters could not possibly have functioned as well as they did. The story seemed to keep spiraling into more wildly unbelievable scenarios . The  last quarter of the book seemed like a bad dream. I kept reading because I felt sure there would be some sort of  emotional resolution for the reader that would make it all worthwhile, but , alas, it was not to be. Unfortunately, I felt that this book was a huge disappointment. I really wanted to like it, and I did like the main character, but I just can't recommend it.
B002ITWSUQ|4.0|I love this movie - sweet with a good message! Well acted and so glad to have it on Amazon - I could watch this movie more than once - a feel good movie to be sure.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|So far so good. I like creatures of Olympus better as far as games of this genre.  Good combo of patience and play for free or pay some to go faster.
B00DZVKQGY|1.0|Maybe because I an an older person I did not like a lot of the language in this book. There was no need for most o f the sexual words.
0062060554|4.0|Good written book.<br />Bought forbhusband and he really enjoyed it.  Took him a while to read though as he kept falling asleep
B000QRIGLC|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  The dedication, love, and commitment of Marcus, his team, and his family and friends are out of this world.  A MUST READ!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Levels are difficult but totally enjoyable.  The artwork is beautiful.  It is addictive, entertaining and challenging at the same time.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Really really good and very interesting and educational. I just couldn't stop reading even when it got sad I never stopped
B000MQ54OY|1.0|I opened up the case and there was no movie in it!!!! Very disapointed!!! I never go around to trying to return this movie or getting a refund. Its been over a year and I just submitted my review
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I finished the entire trilogy (Delirium, Pamdemonium and Requiem) a month ago, and I have to say, I really liked it. The first, book, Delirium, definitely starts the series well. Lauren Oliver is an extremely talented author!
B00129H7VS|5.0|A fantastic mini series, and in 1080 HD to boot. All that and a bag of chips! The image is so clear that you can see the scratches on peoples glasses. Such a wonderful clear image and sound that makes watching the HD version a whole new program!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A true hero.  Chris kept me laughing while on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I could not put this book down.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased this to stream videos from my IPad and phone to my TV. Setup could not have been easier. What a cool device and so easy to use. Shipping was extremely quick.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I am totally surprised by how much I like the show. Well written and acted with a good story line. I find myself &#34;addicted&#34; to this one....
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|Great read. It has changed my perspective on how I do business, and how I engage the world. I highly recommend it.
B004P2HMNM|5.0|Exceptional interior and external. It is going to be another hard to find item just like the green grocer soon.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Just did not &#34;grab&#34; me. The villain was almost random, he did not really convince me of his motives. Of course, there was a lot of good Bond type action.
1410430103|5.0|I wish I had read this book earlier- I would have become a Jack Reacher fan then and not wasted so much time finding this man.  The book arrived on time, it was a smooth transaction and everything was all right.  The only thing that was less than perfect about this book is that it was not mentioned that it was large print.....a little disconcerting when I opened it.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|These are gentle, subtle, spare stories that left me thinking about those people & wanting to know them better.  But then, she always does that.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to have this addictive game on Kindle.  We all need to chill out every now and then, Candy Crush Saga is a great way to relax.<br />Love my Kindle and more a reason to love it even more  :o).<br /><br />Thank you!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very well written book.  It started off slow but once it got going I did not want to put it down. You have to keep reading for it all to come together.  I had no idea where the story was going and why the main character was doing what he was doing.  I kept reading and all was revealed.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The fact that you need gems in order to complete the game but aren't given many  opportunities to obtain them (other than spending real money) is extremely frustrating!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I love the game! But it's hard to earn coins fast and sometimes you need crowns to pay for things. That you don't earn you have to buy. This is why it's only 3 stars!!
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Great game- there are many different variations depending on the sequence with which the bumpers are hit. Speed of the game varies as well from steady to frantic with multiple balls in play
0743525043|5.0|Very informative book on happiness, being centered and experiencing the present!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to learn more about happiness!
0345529057|5.0|SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO GREAT. I read LOTR as a child, many times, and I loved it. THIS is even better! The television series is great, and is how I got attracted to the books, but the show moves slow, and I love seeing the end of the series as the books come out, and I cannot wait for the show to catch up and interpret these great books!
B005VTS4EY|3.0|Not sure how this ended up on my review list. I do not remember downloading it and I certainly do not use it so it couldnt have left an impression on me.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I really like this movie. It is good family movie. It is true story. It is touching with good acting, and it is not cheesy. I can watch it over and over.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|this or any other super man show will not compare to the old original show. They keep adding all this stuff to it and everything is computer generated and so fake looking.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Denzel made you really think he was the pilot that drank, did coke, and flew a plane the next day.
B001JRB16U|5.0|It's a classic. I had to add it to my movie collection because the story is enthralling and the music enchanting.  It reminds you about the magic of childhood.<br /><br />The packaging for this product was top-notch, didn't look like a cheap knockoff or &#34;fake.&#34;  No issues with the discs. Arrived quickly.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Allows me to view, edit and work on office documents while I'm on the go. It's a decent app and handled everything I throw at it.
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|this movie was amazing. I am a huge Superman fan and i was really worried about this movie when i heard Zack Snyder was directing it. I was pleasantly suprised. The extra features in this set are great. This is a must buy set.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Well......if you are into this type of sex....the story line seemed pretty good but Christain is one sick SOB and (forgot the dumb girls name) she was one stupid lady!! But to each his/her own I guess.
B00BAXFAJC|3.0|Enjoyed the book but felt it was extremely repetitive.  And it was a bit long also some of the suspended belief parts didn't actually work for me.
B00001QEE8|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite Disney movies, so I am rather partial.  It's the story of a boy that is raised by wolves and eventually is forced to leave the jungle and return to civilization for his safety (bad tiger wants to heat him) - on his way back to mankind, he runs off and has an adventure (I won't say anything more and spoil it).<br /><br />It is a little &#34;scary&#34; for toddlers, so I would recommend from ages 4+<br /><br />The copy I received arrived quickly and was not a cheap looking knock-off.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I love ANY Stephen King book. It kept up with the original storyline. There were no new characters and the end was awesome.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|I finished the Fringe series and couldn't find something to get into next - then Eureka!!! - Fun characters and liked most of the premise - not so much the ending of first one, a bit contrived BUT overal entertained.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|love these guys!! I like most of the songs that they sing and they are very nice and talented young men.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series! Can't wait to see the movie! I'm looking forward to reading the next book! It has been hard to put down!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome...love it<br />My kids and I can't stop playing it..definitely worth downloading..funny little minions..love their expressions.So cute
020530902X|5.0|The best little guide to writing ever written. Strunk and White's Elements of Syle is required reading for all of our reporters.
B007EECSFA|5.0|An great story, includes history and has a fascinating twist in family history. I gave this book to several friends.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|If I could NO stars what so ever I paid for this song twice and still waiting for it to download to this amazon cloud.  It SUCKS!!!!! don't waste your time
B008NABUU8|3.0|The game itself is fun overall and but the problem I found is that after I bought the slopemania expansion and the unlock all materials for all levels, they worked and I played for about an hour and then then next morning I tried playing on the slopemania expansion and it prompted me to buy it again and it showed that I already own the item, the it prompted me to actually buy it again, what the heck, I bought the items and u can't even use them and I have to buy them again??? The developer and Amazon need to fix this out whoever is responsible for this
B008S4YZCO|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining game... I love it I'm on it all the time and its child said too!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Great drama. Denzel Washinton is fantastic! I completely bought his character and his character's struggle with addiction. The movie moves along at a steady pace and requires a bit of patience but is well worth it.
140006922X|4.0|I found the information in the book deeply interesting.  The overview of history, politics and cultural aspects of the times of Jesus were fascinating  His research and inclusion of data from many different collections added to the depth of information that portrayed and recreated that era.  It was the clearest defining of how the Christian religion came into being that I've encountered in my readings of that period.
B005544TRQ|5.0|FANTASTIC!! Interesting and funny characters, superb script. I like that they film in a lot of different locations which is definitely not cheap. This show keeps my on my toes much like Aaron Sorkin's tv shows. I think it's referred to as intelligent humor :)<br />Absolutely LOVE that there are NO bloody murders, rape, or vampires in this show! THANK YOU and bravo to the creators and writers!
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Makes you think on what to do next. I've played this before on my pc. Now playing on my kindle. I'm enjoying it.<br /><br />L
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Pretty good. Just got today and have been playing it all day. I like it alot and so do my nieces cx
B006LSZECO|3.0|Everyone I spoke to told me the same thing but I had to read it to believe it and understand what they meant. There are many directions the author could have taken the storyline and I personally do not have an appreciation for where she chose to.
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|I like the game but would like it more if it had a timed version. Either you earned points for going faster or could play against friends.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|Why am I in pain?  Why do I feel sluggish? Is it my diet?  Lots of ideas here, many of which I'll pursue.  But please, don't make me give up beer!
B00080ZG10|4.0|The film played perfectly on my laptop, no sign of errors. The CD looked extremely pristine and I honestly have nothing to say bad about.
B003H4I4JU|2.0|Orson Scott labors the plot by adding overly extensive Catholic references through innuendo and by manifesting an erudite relationship with the Portuguese language which is copiously sprinkled on every other page. Neither contributes to the plot and makes for a long slog of a read.<br /><br />The environmental fauna and flora described in the work, do however, provide a much needed respite for the reader.<br /><br />The plot moves at a glacial pace and is 180 degrees from the first book in the series.  So, do not pick this book up thinking it will keep pace with the first book; it does not.  The plot can best be described as a Freudian excursion through many broken minds.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Only have the free version of this one, but the grandsons seem to think it is fun.  Could be frustrating for them if they had access to it all of the time, but short term play when here one at a time, seems to be fine.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I play castle ville on Facebook but had to stop playing cuz it kept freezing on me. I was so happy to see castleville on the kindle fire. It works great.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was a little disappointed by this ending to a great series. Is it too much to ask for a little happy ending every once in a while?
0241951461|5.0|Loved this book as a kid growing up, and I still do.  A fun reading for those who are young at heart.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Surprise ending,  betrayal survival life going on , sounds a bit like Congress.<br />A great series that deserves being put on the big screen
B0086700CM|5.0|This is probably the favorite of the games on my kindle for all the grandsons, age 5 to 11.  They play this one for longer periods of time without getting frustrated or bored.
0679809015|5.0|This book is great for little to see and learn about animals. My nephew loved the book and the size made it easy for him to play with.
B00BWYX2MG|3.0|Worked on my summer leather gloves, but doesn't work on my winter leathers. Still looking for another solution for my winter gloves
1936719010|5.0|This book gave me the perspective I needed to kick the voices of doubt and get back to my creative project.<br />Thank you Steven Pressfield for writing this book and making it easy, fun, and quick to get motivated again!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Love love love! I think this is a great book for teens and adults! It is full of great quotes also
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Great graphics on this one, but I found it frustrating.  Thinking it was because I do not play video games, turned it over to the 11 and 9 year old grandson to show me &#34;how&#34; and they were both frustrated, too, even though they play video games a lot.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|this was a gift for my son and he loved it. It is a very cool canteen to have for camping
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game and the novel ideas behind it.  I would give it 5 stars if I saw more shadow cards,  less credits needed to buy cards,  or at least more credits given daily.  I do not have money to spend on this game, but would like to be able to play more!
B003VANOFY|1.0|BRAND NEW HEADEST - I can't be more disappointed in a product, the LED light on the headset doesn't line up with what the software client is showing for power levels, when &#34;fully charged&#34; the headset gets about 6 hours of usage, I have used the unit for about 6 re-charges and it seems to be getting worse.  I am not sure Logitech understands what 'wireless' means...  VERY disappointed.  (I have called Logitech support and the 800 number got re-directed to another number that is not 24/7, really?)
B00993I6D2|2.0|It is a depressing movie. My wife went to bed after watching ten minutes of the movie. If I saw this movie before I forgot it. I think I read the book in high school since I knew the plot.
B0091THRCU|2.0|i like the case and the idea. one major complaint, within a day of using the case, the stitching on one side started to come undone. i anticipate within a few months it will have come completely undone and will no longer be usable. with a little better build quality this would be a great case option, but alas, as it stands i cannot recommend it.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for BLACKFISH, I was stunned.  The film looked mesmerizing, an in-depth look into something very few people had probably ever thought about.  I vaguely remember back in 2010, when SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed, but I recall the news reports all saying it was ‘trainer error’.  BLACKFISH unveils the truth about what really happened and then throws the curtains aside to expose the psychological damage that is done to killer whales in captivity.<br /><br />I have to confess that I’m not a tree-hugger or animal rights activist, although I do believe we should take care of the earth and treat animals appropriately.  But when I finished watching BLACKFISH, I sat for a while and thought about what I should tell my kids about SeaWorld.  They are wanting to go, but now I’m not so sure I want to take them.<br /><br />This compelling self-argument is the very reason every person reading this review should pick up a copy of BLACKFISH and watch it.  The film is not a preachy PETA promotional video or anything of the sort; it is a vivid and candid look at orcas, the treatment they receive in captivity (from both people and other killer whales), and the mental damage that is done to them by plucking them from the wild.<br /><br />The film is shot well and presents the information in a no-nonsense yet nonjudgmental fashion.  Several former SeaWorld trainers are interviewed and give their testimonies, along with an OSHA investigator that worked on the SeaWorld court case and many other people involved with the industry.  The result is a moving and powerful piece that will make you think.<br /><br />BLACKFISH is an amazing film and I highly recommend giving it a look.  Regardless of whether you like orcas or not, you can’t help but gain respect for them after watching this documentary.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Fast moving story but ends very suddenly. There is no &#34;where are they now&#34; in the story. Would have liked to know what happened after escaping.

B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Being a moderate &#34;trekkie&#34; I purchased this movie to add to my Star Trek collection.  While the disk was fine, the story was one of the poorest since Star Trek V.  If you are a fan buy it.  If you want a good movie - rent this one first to see if it is to your liking.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I think the ending with the car accident and death of Mary's husband is just to improbable and over done.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Dispels the myth that older adults stop being who they are when their hair turns white. This story makes me more mindful of my attitude about older adults. It also makes me work toward my own autonomy as I age-something my children have reacted to with anger & condescension.

B001XUIBNO|5.0|The film offers an engaging mystery and chilling story that is not complete until the very last sights and sounds in the very last scene.
B0091VYG86|5.0|beautiful, beautiful movie. Some might say that the concepts are very liberal, and over dramatized, but if you can look past that, and really dwell on the core message of the movie, it's a brilliant movie that inspire you to sit down and contemplate about the world and what it could turn out to be.

0345803507|3.0|The writing was somewhat juvenile, and the story line was definitely far fetched; however, it was a simple read and good for a little mental escapism.  I'll definitely see the movie.

But if your brain already knows to look left to check the cards in the free cells, you'll feel like a right-hander trying to print the alphabet with the left hand.  I've already deleted it.

B00BWQW73E|1.0|There was this scene in the funny movie &#34;Night Shift&#34; where Michael Keaton (playing Bill Blazejowski) is trying to convince his conservative buddy Chuck (played by Henry Winkler) that they should start a &#34;love broker&#34; business during the night shift they worked at the city morgue. Bill argued that they could protect women from dangerous out-of-town &#34;Johns.&#34; To prove his point, he shows up when Chuck is getting a haircut with a newspaper headline he's holding that reads &#34;Girl scout attacked.&#34; He said &#34;see Chuck? See what I mean?&#34; Chuck then starts to tug at the paper to see the rest of the headline Bill is obfuscating. Finally he succeeds and the headline actually reads &#34;Girl scout attacked by dog.&#34; Bill, indignant, says &#34;dog, guy from out of town, what's the difference, Chuck&#34; to which Chuck says &#34;there's a very big difference. One carries an attache case and the other urinates on trees.&#34;<br /><br />That's what this book reminds me of...full of stories that have some piece of reality, but most of the key pieces are either fiction or skewed to meet the author's thesis.<br /><br />Let me start by saying I respect Brad. I've been interviewed by him a couple times, and found him professional. His stories have been pretty straight down the middle, so the content of this book surprised me because it was so skewed. Not sure if this was because Brad didn't speak in depth to the senior leaders at the Company or because he wanted the book to be more compelling so he spiced it up. But, I've been at Amazon for 16 years, worked for Jeff directly for nearly 12 years, worked on all of Amazon's businesses, and either have first-hand knowledge or pretty good visibility to many of the topics in the book, and the book presents a distorted and often inaccurate perspective.<br /><br />Here are a few examples:<br /><br />- the Quidsi acquisition: did Amazon have to compete with other companies for that acquisition? Sure. This is pretty typical in acquisitions. Did Amazon plan to announce Amazon Mom while the founders were in a meeting at Amazon so they couldn't respond immediately? Come on. Really? That's pretty absurd. Who did Brad speak with who was deeply involved that confirmed that? Was it Jeff Blackburn or Peter Krawiec, the guys who managed the deal? Or, Doug Herrington, who managed Amazon Mom?  No.  Apparently, Brad asked Jeff Blackburn whether this was planned and Jeff told him unequivocally it was not. This is a keystone anecdote in the book and the punch line is made up. Girl scout attacked...by dog!<br /><br />- The 2001 story about when Amazon decided to lower prices is inaccurate. It wasn't some grand announcement in a s-team (Jeff Bezos’s senior leadership team) meeting. Like most things at Amazon, it was through a series of meetings where we were discussing the business and what we wanted to change to drive growth and customer experience. It sounds more dramatic that it came after meeting Former Costco CEO Jim Sinegal and in a grand announcement thereafter at s-team. Problem is, it just isn't true. And, I know because I was in the meeting where we made this call as I was running the Music business at the time.<br /><br />- When Alan Brown left the Marketing leadership role, it was Lance Batchelor and I that co-led marketing. Not Jeff Holden and me (as the author reports).<br /><br />- The comments about the TVs given away for the person who came up with the most bureaucratic process in the company, once again, was only half right. Yes, there was the award. But, we never ran out of the TVs or morphed it into the Door Desk Award. We stopped giving out the bureaucracy award well before the TVs were all given out (the program wasn't quite accomplishing what we'd intended), and the Door Desk Award was an independent idea that was conceived and started.<br /><br />- Several parts of the AWS origin story are inaccurate, and I won't list them all here, but a couple examples:(1) Brad talks about iterating fast by layering services like Flexible Payments Service and Amazon CloudSearch alongside EC2 and S3...while it's accurate that we layered on new services, the key services that we launched that meaningfully expanded the breadth of AWS were Elastic Block Store (EBS) in 2008, CloudFront (our Content Distribution Network) in 2008, and Relational Database Service (RDS) in 2009 (CloudSearch wasn’t launched until 2012); (2) the vision document proposing the AWS business and outlining the initial set of services for AWS (including our compute service, EC2) was finished and presented to the executive team in September 2003. I wrote the document and was lucky to have the help of several people in putting it together. This was about a year before Chris Pinkham moved to South Africa to build the initial version of EC2. Chris played an integral role in the definition, team-building, and product-building of EC2 (despite leaving before EC2 was launched).  There are several errors in this section, and at the end of the day, you could debate how much they matter. But, an impeccably, well researched account it's not.<br /><br />- &#34;Jeff Bots&#34;: In 16 years, I have never heard this term once (and I sponsor several cultural events that attract people from all levels of the organization-- like Tatonka, our buffalo wing eating club). Further, I know the people Brad calls &#34;Jeff Bots&#34; very well. I can't tell if Brad is just badly informed or making this up for drama, but I can tell you that calling people like Steve Kessel or Russ Grandinetti robots is ignorant and another sure sign that this author didn't get inside the Amazon culture closely. I've sat in countless meetings with Steve and Russ where they've come up with strikingly inventive ideas, and fought hard and challenged peers and Jeff Bezos. You don't get far at Amazon by being a robot and caving on what you think is important. &#34;Have Backbone&#34; is an important part of one of our key leadership principles (&#34;Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit&#34;), and the people Brad dismissively calls &#34;Jeff Bots&#34; have backbone in spades. I took this section either as Brad trying to make the book more interesting or his being frustrated that he doesn't get more interesting press interviews with Amazon leaders because they stay on message. Having a strong culture that the leadership team really buys into is very different than having a group of robots who do what they're told. The former is part of what's made Amazon successful the last 18 years (and especially the last 10); the latter is an interesting, but nearly impossible way to be successful in the breadth of businesses Amazon's pursuing-- and plain wrong.<br /><br />- The Culture: Of all the things in the book, this is arguably the most inaccurately stated. The notion that most &#34;Amazon employees live in perpetual fear&#34; is bizarre. Do some?  Maybe.  Suspect that's the case at any company that has high standards. But, do most?  No way. The manner in which Brad characterizes Jeff Bezos and the culture is like dissecting Lebron James' career and saying that he's a bad shooter because you mostly detail his missed shots or that he can't win the big game because he didn't win the championship in his first few years in the NBA. In 18 years, if you want to tell the story that Amazon can be tough on people who don't meet the standards, or Jeff can get impatient and frustrated, it's easy to do. But, just like you need to look at Lebron's total body of work that includes four MVP awards, regular season and playoffs MVP awards the last couple years, and a second straight championship (while making a bevy of clutch, difficult plays along the way), to get the right picture of Amazon's culture, you need to look at the collective body of work. I've been the subject of Jeff's frustration at times through the years, and seen him get frustrated with others, but in the thousands of meetings I’ve attended with Jeff over the last 16 years, I can tell you that this has happened a tiny fraction of the time. Jeff is quite inventive and smart, but also collaborative, an amazing brainstormer, a long-term thinker, not one to give up on an initiative easily, and fun. He's also the single best learner I've met, and like many, has continued to evolve his leadership style over the last 10 years. It's clear to me that this author over-relied on interviews with people who had difficult interactions or endings with Jeff, and mostly in the first half of the Company's history.<br /><br />In my own case, my plan was to come to Amazon for 2-3 years, and then head back home to NYC. I'm still at Amazon in substantial part because of the culture and Jeff. I can't think of another place that starts and ends with the customer the way Amazon does, or that thinks long-term rather than optically for a quarter, or that looks at an area of business (or customer experience) and doesn't let itself get blocked by existing convention, or that gives people who deliver a chance to try any new entrepreneurial venture that makes sense regardless of their experience level in that area, or that hires builders who are unleashed to go change the world, or has such a sharp, inventive, big-thinking, high bias for action, collegial, hungry, and delivery oriented culture. It's why I'm still here 16 years later, Charlie Bell is still here 15 years later, Jeff Blackburn 15 years later, Russ Grandinetti 15 years later, Steve Kessel, 14 years later, Jeff Wilke 14 years later, David Zapolsky 14 years later, Paul Kotas 14 years later, Diego Piacentini 13 years later, Tom Szkutak 11 years later, and the list goes on. There are plenty of opportunities to work elsewhere. We all get the calls. And, you can argue that the start-up scene in Seattle hasn't gotten its &#34;fair&#34; share of new entrepreneurs from Amazon. That's because people are staying at Amazon for an inordinately long time. We work hard here, but Amazon is a builder's dream, and if you want a chance to change the world in a pervasive way, there's no better place.<br /><br />There are many other examples I could cite (my Kindle is marked with about 30 places that are highlighted as inaccurate or misrepresented), but you get the idea.<br /><br />This is the problem when you write a book and don't talk in depth (i.e. many hours) to the principal players who have the full detail.  People argue that this book is really well-researched. I disagree. Just because you conduct 300 interviews doesn't make it well researched. That's like giving credit to a book for the number of pages or footnotes it contains. It's not the number of interviews as much as who you talked to, what access they have to the true details of what's going on, whether you can represent the way the company evolves over time, and what the author then chooses to weave together as his story arc.  I find it nearly impossible to tell an accurate and representative account of Amazon and its culture over the last 18 years if you haven't spent lots of hours with people like Jeff Bezos, Rick Dalzell, Jeff Wilke, Tom Szkutak, Jeff Blackburn, Diego Piacentini, Steve Kessel, Russ Grandinetti, Charlie Bell, David Zapolsky, myself, and other long-time senior folks who know these stories you're trying to write about and understand the culture deeply. Brad didn't talk to Jeff Bezos at all, and spent about an hour with a few of those other people but in a pretty high level way (not really trying to get deep at the core of what makes the culture tick or  what have been the defining chapters in the Company). They were light questions (e.g. “Is it true you hit Jeff with a canoe paddle in your first month?”) or cursory questions that didn't seem to be considered very deeply in the writing. You can ask these people above and they'll tell you the same thing. Would they have told Brad the inner workings of Amazon? I don't know. Amazon is quiet in that respect. But, I do suspect they would have been happy to help Brad avoid getting the culture wrong, or the Quidsi story wrong (in this case, they tried), or several other of the errors.<br /><br />Further, just because it might be frustrating that you can't get the primary characters to tell you everything you want doesn't mean you do your best to make it up yourself. That doesn't lead to an accurate or definitive non-fiction book. It might mean that you don't get to do the non-fiction book you’ve had your heart set on doing. But, that's a more noble path than getting it wrong like this.<br /><br />So, the mantle is still open to tell the real story of Amazon. I’m not baiting people to fill the void, but do know this book isn't it.d with Jeff over the last 16 years, I can tell you that this has happened a tiny fraction of the time. Jeff is quite inventive and smart, but also collaborative, an amazing brainstormer, a long-term thinker, not one to give up on an initiative easily, and fun.

B000002J6F|4.0|One of my favorite albums, I was very disappointed with the Remaster.Listening in my studio thru some very nice monitors,the bass is so muddy and ill-defined it is just low freq mush,and the highs are cut so much they take all the atmosphere out of the music. the music deserves a 5star+,the remastered mix a 1,it sounds better through headphones, almost like that's how they did the remaster.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|The characters are well developed, more so as assisted by the television dramas. Full of wit, extraordinary repartee. High on the action-tension-suspense+goulish scale (ATS+G Scale). I recommend reading the Heat books in order.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Lots of action after the moderate pace & action of Feast For Crows. I was tempted to read both books simultaneously, but opted for the original order. Now I join the hordes of readers playing the waiting game for the next book.

B001HBYHFA|4.0|I'll be honest, when Firefly came out I had no clue what it was. It wasn't until almost a decade later that I found the series on Netflix and started watching it. From then, I was hooked by the great case and original plot lines.<br /><br />After going through the series twice, I decided it was finally time to watch the &#34;finale&#34; of Serenity. My biggest fear was that it wouldn't live up to the hype of the series. Luckily, that was a non-issue. My only other concern was that there would be no new adventures with the crew of the Serenity after watching the movie. Still, I pressed on and watched the end of this epic saga.<br /><br />The movie itself does a much better job of outlining the characters than the first few episodes of the show ever did. Granted there was a reason for this, but if this movie led the way to the series, I think there would have been a larger following.<br /><br />Serenity picks up a while after Firefly left off. Not all of the crew are still aboard the ship, as the Shepherd has moved onto a planetary colony elsewhere and Inara is tending to one of her &#34;clients&#34;. The movie mostly deals with the crew trying to free Summer from the chase of the Alliance. In order to do this, they have to battle countless foes including the mysterious reevers. The movie provides details that would have been covered if the show had not have been cancelled so quickly, such as why the Alliance is after Summer. Truth be told, it is very obvious why any organization would want her &#34;talents&#34; after seeing her abilities in action.<br /><br />I gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars because there were some parts that I wasn't impressed with. Wash's death really sticks out in my mind. Not that killing his character was wrong, but how they did it seemed tragic. He could have died protecting Zoe, sacrificing himself to make sure she managed to escape an impossible situation or gone down with his ship while everyone else escaped (Titanic-esque, I suppose).<br/><br />Still, this was a great movie that I will probably watch at least once or twice more. I'm sad to see the cast and crew leave their roles, but I'm glad they were given one last chance to tie things up at least a little bit.
B009KPCG6M|5.0|As soon as I heard her on Pandora I knew I had to own her CD. She has an amazing voice, and every song on the album is beautiful and kind of haunting. Phildel has one of the purest voices I've ever heard and I can't wait for her to make more music.<br />If your're still on the fence all I have to say is that the last song alone is worth the price of this CD. Funeral Bell is a masterpiece.
B000W27AE0|5.0|Always loved this album since heard it back in mid 80s - got the cassette of it Xmas of '85 (or was it '86??) lol so of course had to upgrade to mp3s :)
B007R11DKQ|4.0|An exceptional fantasy tale by Neil Gaiman rendered into a movie that's fun to watch. Follow a young man on a journey to retrieve a &#34;fallen star&#34; to impress the girl of his dreams and who instead finds an alternate world that exceeds his dreams and turns him into a man. Well acted, tightly scripted, beautifully filmed, this movie will not disappoint (if, that is, you're the kind of person who liked The Princess Bride).
B001EBWIUO|5.0|It is one of a kind. Everything fits perfectly.  I never tire of watching this great one of a kind classic.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I just downloaded this game and I'm already on level 7...I'm really enjoying playing this game sometimes it's hard to put the kindle down. All I can say is download this game and try it yourself
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|some are good , and some not so much. My favorite game is Bejjeweled Blitz and you can't offer it. Wish you did
B00008G1KJ|5.0|You're just not allowed to rate this any other way than 5 stars.  This is what happens when a 60's blues guy gets his hands on the controls.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Haven't read the book, but I'm pretty confident the only thing it has in common with this movie is the title. This movie is in no way a zombie movie - in any classical sense. It is a barely coherent globe-trotting hero-on-a-quest movie that is pretty predictable. Never a tense moment, never a doubt the hero will figure it out. Not a zombie scare in the whole thing.
B000E6EH1S|5.0|I purchased this because I noted that many have called this the best Symphonie Fantastique (\\"S.F.\\") out there.  I would agree.  I've listened to a number of performances of S.F. and many bog down at some point or another, or lose sight of the fact that this is highly programmatic/romantic music.  This performance doesn't bog down and is a pleasure to listen to all the way through.  It works on an absolute level, i.e., the music is great by itself,  but I also get the clear idea of each movement.  S.F. is a milepost in orchestral music; it doesn't deserve anything less than a stellar performance.  Look no further; this is a stellar performance.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|This is probably the most wonderful book I have read. I can only recommend it very strongly! Amazing! Awesome revelation!
B00280GDFQ|4.0|Excellent cinematography; unusual look at a relatively unknown part of Indian life in both the slums and well-off neighborhoods, shows a view of India's corruption within the police force that's probably not that unusual either; provides a unique view of human exploitation (essentially slavery) at it's worst; and has good character development with decent acting and a bittersweet ending.<br /><br />This movie definitely keeps the viewer's attention.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|How do you summon eye of ctuthulu<br />Who do an't like this game how is this stupid<br />This is from Eli aka Dr bomb nice pictures
0307341577|5.0|Even better than Gone Girl.  I love Gillian Flynn books - well written, great plot twists, great characters.  Write more!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Cant keep the kids from playing this game they love it and I think it has helped my 5 yo with his reading.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Alice in Chains have been going steady since their last outing in 2009. On this effort, the band obviously sound more comfortable with new vocalist / guitarist William DuVall. In my opinion, there's very little that AIC can do wrong... and on this album, there is certainly nothing to complain about! Most of the tracks are mid-tempo which is sort of what we've come to expect from AIC over the years. There are a few stand out tracks - Voices... is radio friendly and anthemic and will sure get your attention. It is a great catchy song. Stone, Hollow, Lab Monkey are also as good as well as the chugging heaviness of 'Phantom Limb'. Solid effort... its good to have AIC around and not necessarily try to re-create  the sound of the 90's which defined them. They're more mature now, with a new band member and have seem to found their footing well in this modern day music scene when any band with a guitar now is passed off as 'rock music'.
0399161287|5.0|Mike Tyson....enough said. I love to read biographies and this cat is an interesting human. I have always wanted to get inside the head of the champ and by reading this book it all makes sense. Tough love, tough neighborhood, and a tough SOB! I ordered the book, ripped it open and before I knew it I was almost done. You can't put this book down. I always said one more page. Mike Tyson could have given up after all he went through but he overcame so many challenges in his life. Most people would have been dead or life sentenced. He turned a negative into a positive and believe it or not, he is a strong role model. His life is back on track and he wants people to know the truth.
159463176X|3.0|The book was pretty good but certainly not as satisfying as the Kite Runner.  The story was not as compelling nor were the characters as well formed or sympathetic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Interesting can't wait to read the other ones. Prime Is awesomeness to be able to read the books for free
B00FHATBGW|4.0|The hidden objects were too easy to find. I played the whole game in hardcore mode. Other than that it was great.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|The guys are funny. Also, this is one show that is almost as funny as it was the very first season and that is rare to find.
0316228583|2.0|Ugh.  I couldn't even get past the first 80 pages because I was too disinterested.  It was really hard to figure out who the characters were and what their relationship was to each other.  Maybe if I had continued, I would have like it.  Loved the Harry Potter series but just got bored with this one.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|Diverse and interesting. Keeps me motivated. Thoroughly enjoy every workout, every time. Even when I may not want to workout sometimes, this lights my fire!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The book was horrible! I loved the series but this book completely ruined them all. I also will not be watching the movie because of this!
B005OLF6BI|5.0|Just like store bought item, it worked flawlessly. It's a good gift for your girlfriend if she is a swift fan.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play for hours it passes time when I have nothing to do. I hats having to wait for friends to give you tickets. but overall I love the game
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Seemed more real to me.  Enjoyed the evolving story more than in Book one.  More warmth, I think.  GOOD Read.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Intriguing concept, very well written. Very provocative especially in<br />this day and age when we are all in love and dependent on electronic communication and support systems.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|I started watching this show during the Halloween season this year and was instantly hooked.<br />An immersive story line with likeable and scary characters alike.<br />The story was fresh but familiar at the same time.<br />I loved it.<br />Recommended.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love NCIS - this team of actors are the best and I'm so sorry that Zeva has left the show but know that they'll find the right combination for next season - looking forward to buying more episodes soon.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|This is a fantastic new artist. Not a dud song in the bunch.  I think 2014 will be her year to out sell Katy and Gaga!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I read this book a long time ago. Thinking about it today still makes me smile.  There is magic on every page of this delicious book.
B00B2FLDRQ|4.0|Very nice and touching read, thoug i don't think it reflects the feelings of an person with Asperger for real.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The acting by all in this show is supurb. It is non stop legal drama at its best.  It is intelligently written , well acted and very entertaining.
B008IJT0CE|2.0|I got it for free during a promotion period.  It didn't work for me at all so I just deleted it from my phone.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|Both me and my husband are addicted to Candy Swipe 2. This was a FREE app, and much more fun to play. We thought if we liked the second version, we would like the original. Not as many features. The first time my husband played he reached the maximum score and level. That was it!! We haven't played it since. Not worth the $3.99.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I love the timer feature and I find the sounds very relaxing.  It's nice being able to choose the sound combinations, too.
B00319ECC4|5.0|Fear Factory doing what they do best, absolute ear splitting metal  which really gets me amped on the way to the gym.  These guys got banned in Fresno for being too damn loud, far to late/early in the morning; god I love these guys!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game.<br />It's fun and its challenging, it has good graphics to it. It's very time consuming.<br />I would recommend this game.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I found the topic of this courtroom drama, centered over a hand written will, its validity, and the fascinating family tree and history,  the battle of lawyers, and the ultimate decision and results to be unique and refreshing.  A bit slow at times, Grisham again grabs the reader by the throat and I could not put the book down.
B00BCCEBRI|5.0|If you're a Bream fan, how can you not own this collection?  I grew up listening to many of these albums, and here they all are, for about $2.50 per CD.  Hands down my favorite classical guitarist of all time, I couldn't be happier than to know I'll be listening to every minute of every one of these over the next few months.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Ugh. What an awful book; it was like a major down hill slope from divergent to this. Divergent was interesting and worth reading. Insurgent was OK, not great not awful, but Allgiant? WHY? I read the mixed reviews on the book and decided to read it anyway hoping it wouldnt be so bad. WRONG! This book is a snooze fest, about half way through it I just gave up. The characters have no depth, and there is just a ton of blah blah blah blah. zzzzzzzzzz... oops i fell asleep just thinking about it! Do yourself a favor and just do not read this book. It will completely let you down.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Loved the show and all the actors were great. Enjoyed the story very much. Wish it had been longer. So sorry they stopped the series would have enjoyed seeing more of this.
0399246665|3.0|Weren't as good as I was expecting. Hard to match up for young children when the matching one is all the way at the back. Your money is better spent on a memory game I think.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|I fell in love with Elizabeth Gilbert with Eat Pray Love but I couldn't finish this one. I will try again but for me it was like the taste of a Hersheys kiss after a Godiva truffle. Good, maybe even great, but nothing feels like first love.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I probably would enjoy this game but as soon as I installed it I got a message saying I was short on storage space. So I had to delete it before I got a chance to play it. So this review will probably not help anyone.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It's gripping from the first page to the end. Can't wait for the third book! Once you start, you won't be able to stop.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I enjoyed this final book of the Divergent trilogy. Bittersweet with hope, remembrance, and sadness for the characters, and for me. Roth is to be commended for writing riveting fiction for readers of all ages. Well, maybe tweens and up. Thoroughly enjoyed the series and wholly recommend to all.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book and series was off the chain and I just love reading and would love to be Poseidon God of the sea!
B005544TRQ|1.0|I had hoped for a good show like some of the other great ones on USA like Pysch and White Collar. This show had way to much cursing.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first two books, but this one just did not finish the series how I thought it would.  Kudos for how the story went, but it left me so sad and feeling terrible about this series.  Did not leave me on a happy memorable note to remember this series.  For me, a terrible ending to a potentially great series.  It receives a three because the book was well written.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Awesome movie, nicely streamed through Amazon! Great chapter in the first Avengers saga, gets me very excited for the Winter Soldier this spring.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great product to clean up your memory on the Kindle Fire.  I use it all the time whenever I get a message that memory is running low.  I like the fact that you can either take the program's suggestions or pick and chose what you want to delete from memory.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Outstanding story.. John Grisham has a wonderful way of spinning a story and holding your attention. Could not put this story down. Read it in 2 days
B00FN811SY|5.0|It makes bible reading enjoyable, clear, understanding and you can do research. When you read this there is no confusion about Jehovah, Jesus his son and Jehovah's purpose for mankind.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good characters, interesting turn of events, well written as always by Grisham.  Sometimes the depositions and court routine bogged the plot down, but I learned a lot too about procedure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I don't know what it is about this game, but it is so addictive.  I don't usually like &#34;running&#34; games, but something about Subway Surfers had gotten both my brother and me addicted to playing it everyday now.  We have the New Orleans edition and am looking forward for a change soon.  Hope that the Kindle versions will keep up.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Why only 4 starts?  Because it isn't the Shining.  Then again - what King book since really measures up to that one?  This one will appeal to casual as well as hard core King fans.  And if you haven't read the Shining, READ IT FIRST!
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|The best purchase I have made in a long time.  Love the band and love this purchase.  Thanks so much.
031623480X|5.0|The information in this book is a real eye-opener, a slap in the face. Almost everything I've read and heard about a healthy diet up until now is proven to be the opposite, and quite unhealthy for your brain. I've changed my diet dramatically as a result. I highly recommend this book and plan to give out several copies as Christmas gifts to family. It's a far better gift than a new tie or sweater!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|A very good follow-up to the original Magic Academy.  With this version, you can actually hear the characters talk.  The premise of the game is still pretty much the same even though the storyline is better.  It was fun playing and knowing that there is an ending, made it worth the time.  Hope they can add some twists to the next version.
B00EI2Y4MQ|5.0|nice display. that is easy to read and easy to use. i was able to get it for free as the app of the day, but it is worth the few cents they originally charge for it
B00E5N8E6K|5.0|I chose this because, I have been a Def Leppard fan for a long time and love them.  I have seem them in concer so many times and in the last few tours that they have done, I was not able to see them.  The DVD is the best and felt like I was there.  Thanks so much.
B000MGATTE|4.0|having read all of King's novels, this is probably one of my least favorite.  I just could not get into the story. I may come back to this book in a few years and try again.
1451678193|5.0|This might sound odd but, for all his fame and popularity, Bradbury was far greater than most say. He is awesome! I'm a writer and read people like Bradbury as inspiration.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its free!! Angry Bird games are simply addicting .. overall its worth the download You have nothing to lose but time playing angry bird
B003O86FMW|5.0|Obviously an awesome sequel. Cant wait to read the third. Can't wait to see the movie. Can't wait to quit this survey
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun game for all ages!  Works great on my kindle.  Time limits for growing or gathering things are a little long at time.
B000002AGN|5.0|Brubeck is classic jazz, and this is his signature album. I've taught music to my son. He has taken it several steps farther. When I played this album for him, he recognized the complex beats.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Need you even ask?  The whole series is great.  I could spend a whole evening (with my friends) watching them all.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I love Baldacci's writing!  He makes King and Maxwell so real while relating their adventures. I couldn't put it down.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|The graphics are amazing. This game is so much fun and addictive. Fun for all ages. Great way to pass time.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a great game no real money required and does not make you wait forever for anything!!! I highly recommend for people that loved and miss the old farmville and frontierville.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Best Bond movie to date. It brought the story full circle. Not campy just good action from start to finish.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|This book confirmed what I knew already in a very convincing manner, honest, profound. Bringing consolation to those who are grieving and a much wider perspective of what 'reality' is. Incredibly wider than the perspective of many modern scientists. This book might have ben written by many others but the background of the author as a  scientist is not coincidental to me (also a scientist). I bought the book as a gift already for friends in Dutch and in Portuguese translation.  A MUST read!
B00D1X0576|2.0|I have tested its results with other test system and it give my incorrect results at times, I will be using another sorce
B00EK0UBPU|4.0|One or more NZ commentators have lambasted this large work.  But it won a prestigious prize notwithstanding the revered competition it faced.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I LIKED and enjoyed this book.  I failed to connect to the various 'draw-you-in' ploys used to gain and retain attention.  But the novel stands on its own without these as a very well crafted mystery novel - with many interesting and sometimes very amusing side threads woven in.<br /><br />Those who do not wish to think about what is going on in the course of reading may be disappointed.  While hardly a who-dunnit format, there are many similarities.<br /><br />The novel is set in late 19'th century New Zealand Gold-mining town on the West Coast of the South Island.  The dated context does little to enlighten but MUCH to enthrall and mystify the progress of the story.  And it is an engaging story indeed.<br /><br />You will not have all the goings-on at your command at the end.  Several mysteries are still concealed at the last page.  The coda is not supplied, but no-doubt a re-read will pull most of these threads together.<br /><br />I was also rather charmed by the adoption of Victorian literary style - right down to printing of \\"d__n\\".  Not always successful as the occasional modern phraseology leaks in.<br />I thoroughly recommend this book to all readers looking for something out of the C. Dickens age with a modern perspective from a modern and very talented author.<br /><br />Most impressed.<br />Jim Parr
B008Y212PI|5.0|Got this as a FAOTD a while back and just finished the game.  I like that the game has varying levels of difficulty,  but got progressively harder as you moved through the game.  Recommend to anyone who likes a puzzle they can put down and come back to.
B00DVPN30A|5.0|Amos Lee is one of the best story tellers today and his delivery on his music is impeccable.  He does it again with this newest album of his and hits the mark perfectly.  Great listen!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love looking for things.  The challenge is great for the mind.  Hate to stop playing this one for it is addicting.
B00DXPC1U6|5.0|I am going to miss DEXTER and his antics so much. The final season shows a different Dexter...someone trying to get and keep what/who is important to him. There are some really horrible (but not entirely unexpected) twists and we lose some beloved characters tragically...but everything is wrapped up for the most part. How the series ends was interesting and made me happy but it may be considered a cop-out to some. In any case, if you are a die hard fan like me, you will want to own the entire run.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Made me cry. Super fast read. Great for teenagers or adults. This book has some twists and turns I didn't predict.
B000URWMDG|5.0|You can never go wrong with Supertramp.  This, in my opinion, is one of their best. The clairty of the instruments, the power of the vocals, and the incredible writing of the lyrics is simply awesome.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Mr. Hosseini has you right there with his people like your living the whole tremor of life with them.  It also shows how things were with the people of that time and their struggles.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|I have purchased 20+ Intel CPU's over the last 4 years and they are all exceptional without problems.  I wish all electronic products were this reliable and error free.  This i3 was used in an HTPC and was perfect for the application.  You cannot go wrong with this item when you want a replacement or are building a modest computer for general use.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Watch it. Do it. You're welcome. My tastes are eclectic. Favorite movies include Super Troopers and Fight Club.  This is just  as good...
B000QAUNLK|5.0|Classic vintage album by Elton John, never tire listening to it.  Vinly has a way of really bringing out exactly what the artist had intended.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game!!!! The graphics are great. Much better than the free versions out there. This is the first app I loaded on my kindle and it works great.
B002RKSXJG|5.0|I loved this book. Mr. Collins is a great story teller. I can only imagine  what it would have been like to read this in serial form.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Wonderful writing. Beautiful journey of a foster child, the search for family,love, and trust. Taps into the human spirit.  Great book club selection.
B0027MJU00|5.0|A nail biter to the end. Very gripping. I also liked the multiple person narrative. I liked this book much better than Gone Girl.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Enjoyed the read very much. I especially like the way that animals and her love of cooking peek a boo throughout the book.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Over all a great time killer. The only complaint I have is that the tasks do not recognize already built builds.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm about 1/2 way through the book and I love it!!!  Stephen King at his best!  I love this sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;, and I'm so glad that 36 yrs later he still has the capability and the willingness to write a sequel that does the original novel justice.  Bravo!
034580404X|5.0|The story was erotic and tantalizing. I found myself unable to stop reading. I wanted to know what was going to happen next.
B00F522C7C|5.0|My 3 year old grandson loves it and that's important.  He was able to get into the movie, understand it and enjoy it.  I thought it was good myself
B005H29GSI|5.0|I got this for my grandsons.  They love it.  It arrived on time and was in excellent condition.  They love Angry Birds.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|download &amp;  I LOVE IT!!!!  It  is nice to have something to get your mind off troubles in USA!  Hope all service members get this free....GOD BLESS THE USA
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This game is a good game if you want to learn how to play piano.It was crazy great for me! (;
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Great!  I have been a believer for a long time.  Liked the exercises?  I don't have seven more words to use
B000JLSM00|4.0|Vintage John Wayne movie with absolutely great Monument valley scenery. Wayne plays an inscrutable Civil War veteran returning home and then goes on a five year quest to find a niece who was kidnapped by the Comanche Indians. Wayne &#34;steals&#34; every scene he is in. The western scenery and realistic settings are fabulous.
B00FN811SY|1.0|I have experienced the performance of this app on other devices and it is wonderful. The one star I gave it is because it will not work on the Kindlle fire HD, otherwise I would give it 5 stars. Wishing I had a different device so I could use it. It is a wonderful tool to help study the Bible. :(
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY ONE. IT CERTAINLY WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYONE STRUGGLING NEVER TO GIVE UP ON LIFE.  LOVELY ROMANCE.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I think that getting away from the pretty boy Sean Connery clones has really given life back to a tired series. Craig is the perfect Bond for the new Millennium, more hard boiled, but still very much 007. I love the scene on the train where he falls into the car amongst all the wreckage, and stops to shoot his cuffs!  Bardem is a bad guy cast from the Dr No/Ernst Blofeld mold and steals many of the scenes. I haven't paid much attention to the Bond movies since Connery left, the few that I saw I found dismal.. I won't be missing any more!
B0002IQNAG|1.0|I received this box set in a cheap, barely padded envelope.  The first thing that I noticed, when I removed the box from the envelope was that the corners were crushed.  When I opened the box, much of the plastic case and plastic hubs (which hold the DVDs in place) were shattered.  There was broken plastic shards and loose DVDs all over the place.  In addition, the DVDs were scratched all to heck.  Finally, because they were sent by a seller other than Amazon, Amazon could not send me a replacement....only a refund.  That made me mad because the DVD set was on sale for $15.00.  Now the price has gone up to $45.00!!  I love Amazon, but I try not to buy box sets from them anymore because they are just to heavy and bulky for the flimsy DVD envelopes that Amazon uses.  Now, I simply price match at a local store when I can.  Amazon really needs to use better packaging , especially because many of us consider these limited edition box sets to be collector's items and want them in pristine condition.
B004SVM7BW|3.0|When I first got this app I loved it ad I still do, but now when I download from a site the silk browser takes over and fails the download and says download unsuccessful every time from  JW archives. RepliGo reader use to come up with other apps to give you a choice of which one to download to. Now silk takes over and failed to download. Very upset with the silk browser.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I've always been a Judas Priest fan and this album doesn't disappoint. Their first concept album is multilayered and alternately heavy and symphonic. An awesome work.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Overall a must-see film.  The premise is quite engaging, and the film takes a serious look at alcohol addiction.  It reinforces our awareness that people we know or depend on could be closet alcoholics.  Washington, as usual, is amazing, but the directing could be crisper.  At critical times Flight falls for the temptation to depend on computer-generated action scenes, especially in the critical scene in which Washington's character saves the day by landing the plane.  Although visually spectacular, the scene defies probability to a degree that the film momentarily undermines its overall credibility.  Other than that, and a couple of other less-critical lapses into contemporary film cliches of computer-generated special effects, this is an important film, dealing with important contemporary issues.
B00BC0JGCA|5.0|Fintroll is back with another awesome CD. Of all my favorite bands that came out with new albums this year, Fintroll is by far the best of them.  The traditional folk atmoshphere combined with Christianity stomping troll metal makes for a most excellent musical endeavor. Even with the addition of horns to the music, it is in no way hindered and even adds a wonderful appeal. Now if only Korpiklaani, Tyr, and Ensiferum could have continued with their original direction, it would have been a great year, but I only get one excellent offering and it comes in the way of Fintroll.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|This book reads like Helen was just trying to crank out another best seller…she completely falls short of this expectation
B00846REIS|5.0|Probably them best book I have read in a very long time. Read it in 4 days (I'm not a reader typically) so that was extremely fast for me. This book engulfed my whole life. It was all I thought about. I took my kindle everywhere hoping I'd get 5 minutes to read. Obsessed is putting it lightly. I have stayed up way too late every night this week reading. Can't wait to start the second one.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a book that I will never forget.  It was written with so much passion and thought.  It seemed slow at the beginning but soon it will &#34;catch you&#34;.  I cannot wait for the movie.
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|As a horror movie freak, I loved this movie!!! Lot of horror movies coming out of Hollywood these days seem to be a rehash or a similar movie you've watched before.  Not this one!!!  Great and not predictable!!
B004WR125O|1.0|Stopped working after 3 months. Didn't notice until after about 6 months.  Outdated technology and poorly manufactured.  Add on's rarely work well, but expected better.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game but hate getting stuck one a level for two or more months.  I wish there were more options for passing a level besides paying money.  Otherwise I would have rated it five stars.
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|Good stories twined together with the &#34;Death of the Doctor&#34; story arc.  No good reason not to be 5 stars - just that I still miss David Tennant (my favorite Doctor.)
1405911662|4.0|It did keep me waiting to find out how it was going to end.  I will buy more from this author.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Sure took kindel long enough to get this app. I play and get madbut its all part of the game.its fun.I. would suggest it but everyone I know allready plays.
0425252868|5.0|If it were not a true story, no one would  believe it.  There was more than one miracle working in Franz Stigler's life.  Caution: once you start reading this well-written book, you will find it almost impossible to put down until finished.  And Hollywood couldn't come up with a better ending.  Absolutely unforgettable!
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This is it.  This is the album that thrust TSFH into the sight of the public.<br />In my opinion, this is by far the best album that TSFH has ever made, and the first album that I listened to ad naseum, with favorites such as Heart of Courage, Freedom Fighters, Protectors of Earh, To Glory, Invincible, Moving Mountains, Black Blade.  There is no better album by them.  With this album TSFH lifted itself into public view and has made listening to soundtrack music a genuine genre.<br />Every time I listen to this album, I just know that there is going to be a rush of emotion, and that I will need to listen to it again and again.<br />A must-buy for every lover of classical music, orchestral rock, movie themes, and even just the casual listener.<br />If you hate it, then you most likely have no soul or have an obsessive need to listen to the repetitive and identical songs that plague today's media,
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Not just your average cookbook. Loads of insightful strategies on learning any new subject by breaking it down into smaller steps. The recipes are also amazing, even though the ingredients can be hard to source in normal stores.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Horrible filthy movie! Took what could've been a great story line and made it into a b list quality movie. Full of filth.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|At first, one may find this book kind of confusing but then I could not put it down until I finished it!,<br />Rosemary
B00DW39B2K|4.0|You just can't go wrong with these two actors. A story that needed to be told about going to war.
B000I3UMLQ|2.0|A poor film on its own but tons of fun with with the Mr. Plinkett commentary from redlettermedia.com. Highly reccomended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like it at first I thought it was an addictive game but after playing it I realize it is but it's really fun to play maybe that's why it's addictive
B004XZ99LO|5.0|I am a fan of Cirque du Soleil and this is one I have not seen before.  The performers are amazing and they do an excellent job in their portrayal of The Journey of Man.  The 3D is also very good.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Unfortunately I didn't find the final book in the trilogy to be anywhere near as interesting as the previous books. I will say that the result of the city was unexpected, but in my opinion the story could have ended much better or even continued.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love this series! So smart! The cast isn't hard to look at, either. Great dialogue. Could do without the annoying inter office romance.
B0042LJTQO|5.0|Franz Schubert and Alfred Brendel - what a treat! It's so wonderful to have this compilation of Schubert's  later piano works.
B00447G2PM|5.0|Very good 3D.  Movie is kind of a documentary so expect that type of film.  Photography is very good and it is an interesting film.
B00GRVEDCM|5.0|Easy to learn fun to play us my code 1900B4 for free crystals and check it out, and hope to see you in the arena
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Hard to follow between Tris and Tobias point of view because they sounded alike.... Ending had a life lesson that most know if you have ever lost anybody.... If you read for escape and enter another world then skip this one.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Great Emotions on this album I love it since Day one gotta say one of the best albums of 2013 something fresh new and beautiful. &#34;I Was a Fool&#34;, &#34;Now I'm All Messed Up&#34; this album is stunning!
B0043VDIAG|3.0|I am torn between liking the story and getting annoyed with the repetitiveness of the husband's constant expression of his &#34;love/hate&#34; for Erin. By two thirds through the book, every time the book goes to his side of story I found myself skipping pages as I have already read this  and I was bored with rereading the train wreak that his life has become due to his own actions. I did enjoy Erin's story and seeing her grow.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love a book with a twisted turn especially when you can't figure the ending out. I Sunday II read the book for 10hrs straight. The story got so good I could not put the book down.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|I just loved these movies!  I can not wait to see the next one.  I am so curious what will happen to them next.  I own all of them except this one on DVD and decided to buy this one for my Kindle Fire.  I am so happy I did because now when I go somewhere I can watch it any time I want.
B0086HGW42|5.0|This album is beautiful and special Ed Sheeran doesn't dissapoint like &#34;U.N.I&#34;, &#34;Wake Me Up&#34; & &#34;Give Me Love&#34; are highlights this album is cute buy it. Ed did a fabulous job!
B0035OC830|5.0|I enjoy Bill Bryson and his sense of humour. It was a great pleasure to follow Bill's personal journey in the US.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|!!!It's am excited this finally came to amazon.  Awesome,  awesome!!! My hubby groaned, but he doesn 't know how fun it is to crush those candies!!!
B005UG53NS|5.0|I loved all the Harry Potter books and movies. I am just very sad that this is the last one.  How fun to see all the characters grow up and become so brave.  The movies were not exactly like the books, but I can understand that they had to cut out some things or the movies would go on forever.  I am just happy that I read the books also.  I just keep going back to them and read them all over again just for the fun of it.
B00F880BWG|3.0|Compared to other seasons, this season has been more slow paced.  While still an overall interesting season, the urge to tune in every week hasn't been there like previous seasons.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Poignant delivery of every side of the story. Second time reading through the series and I am more impressed this time as opposed to last.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is a fun game. Exciting. Should play it. Go fast. Faster the better it is. Download, it will be a good choice.
B005I64U5C|1.0|I regret this purchase. Ryan Reynolds is a terrible actor, and a terrible Green Lantern. Poor effects in movie are visually distracting and has a very 90s comic book movie take that feels very out dated.
1580084621|3.0|Amazing book with great pictures and information. The recipes I've made are delicious. However, none of them give you the number of servings they make, which is frustrating when trying to plan a dinner.
B002RVCD6O|4.0|It is a very entertaining movie,  keeps the interest of the kid and adults as well was a very goog buy
B000RLH2VM|4.0|good acting. interesting plot basis. nasty villains. seen a couple of times. DeNiro fit his part particularly well. I've always liked the actor who played his french buddy.
1451648537|4.0|A great inside look of Steve Jobs life and history of Apple. Any fan of Steve Jobs or Apple must read this title
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|It took a few listens for it to grow on me, but overall I like this album. It's a little too club music-y for me, and I am really not a fan of the two tracks featuring rappers, but it's pretty good. Very sex oriented, and definitely not something I would let a kid listen to, but still a good album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. Its like temple run but only better. The minions are so cute. I highly reccommend this game to anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is fabulous!  I can enjoy HD stuff from Youtube that just doesn't look good (or is laggy) on my laptop/phone.  I don't have Hulu/Netflix but for the money, it's perfect.  Google Play - that's great too!<br /><br />I would give this item five stars, if I could 'throw' more products from my phone or laptop onto my TV.  Google is sure to widen the offerings when this starts taking off.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|There is little doubt that Malcolm Gladwell is an engaging story teller, clearly a result of his his background as a journalist. His style is both easy to read and informative. The individuals whose lives and stories he uses to illustrate his points are at once interesting and at the same time well chosen to illuminate the issues under his social microscope. These are stories told with enough detail, often gleaned from personal interviews with the people at whom he chooses to look in intimate detail. He avoids in large measure the narrow vision that such inspection may yield by also investigating the social sciences that have searched out the details of such difficult concepts. Everyone has some idea who &#34;makes it&#34; and who does not. That is often easy to see because life rewards those who make great effort in general. The difficult part is understanding why some succeed so well and others who may be even more gifted do not, at least in terms of the world's way of rewarding the star performers. It is often the grist of of rumor and innuendo as to why or how some people make it to the top of the &#34;food chain.&#34; But to analyze the reasons carefully and then apply the scientific data of real studies to those stories brings this clearly into the realm of reality, if we ever really know that that is. As one who has spent a lifetime trying to apply the results of scientific study to the real world I found his approach noteworthy because of its practical applicability. I have read many dry textbooks, articles and studies and sometimes had difficulty seeing their real world application. But these stories are very illustrative of the points Mr. Gladwell is attempting to help us see with clarity.<br />I enjoyed very much reading this work and wondering if it would have made some difference in the way I lived my own life and what I may have accomplished had I applied the message of its pages. I think that this can help everyone with ambition and ability to achieve more and those who may not have as much of a gift do well with what they have inasmuch as he clearly points out that achievement of greatness is often the result of great effort and application of what natural ability one has. I liked the &#34;10,000 hours&#34; as a real world application of what it takes to do it well.<br />There is just enough science to give the work credibility, but not make it dry or over the heads of most. This and all the others of Gladwell's work that I have read have that same engaging style, enough to help one understand and believe it and enough of the stories of real people to make it interesting and applicable.<br />I have recommended this book to my friends and family, especially those who are in the fields of childhood education or influence and who are either children growing up in this competitive society or raising children themselves. Everyone has something to learn from this either about themselves, those they may seek to help and those whom they may choose to emulate.<br />I liked this book. I read it on my kindle, standing in line, sitting waiting or just absorbed by its message. It was hard to put down. This was the first of Mr. Gladwell's works I read, but then quickly read others which seem to have the same merit.more and those who may not have as much of a gift do well with what they have inasmuch as he clearly points out that achievement of greatness is often the result of great effort and application of what natural ability one has.

1616550414|5.0|I bought this for my sister's birthday. She is a huge Zelda fan, so this seemed like the perfect gift. She was extremely excited when she opened it, and the two of us looked through it together. It's a gorgeous book, with tons of cool information and pictures. One of my favorite aspects of the book was the character concept sketches that lead up to finalized designs. I would recommend this book for any die-hard Zelda fan.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|We have watched The Walking Dead since the first night it premiered.  In my opinion, it is the best cable television series I have ever watched.  We are so hooked on it that we go through withdrawals in the summer, so we watch it on DVD.  I have never watched a series and been so dedicated to it.  It's addictive and intriguing.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|A 60 plus year old couple shouldn't like an Edwardian soap opera so much, but we can't help ourselves. My wife and I simply love this series. The scenery, the costumes and the cast make it worth every penny.  The  quality of photography and the HD format are extraordinary.  Everything is very historically correct. No shortcuts were taken to make this as real as could be done without a time machine.  Bravo.
1401322336|5.0|Great cooking book. Really like how he divided it into sections. You got your beef, pork, fish ... And the recipes are awesome
B00136NUG6|5.0|Put this on my Kindle and played it over and over again on my ride to a recent EW&F concert, then all the way home.  EW&F are still amazing and listening to this album helps me remember how incredible they are in concert.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Its been a while since i read one of Grisham's books, and I enjoyed this very much. It kept me on edge until the very end.It is a A stimulating different story line, but captivating if thats the right word for it.
0385537131|5.0|Another super story by John Grisham. I grew up in MS and am again astonished at his way of drawing out personalities and the tragedies remaining as a result of slavery and segregation.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Like this one a lot.....<br />Good graphics home screen hard to get down but play is done well . Cars could be easier to earn tho.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is awesome. you should get it. it is just like temple run temple run two. five stars. awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
B0087ITBPC|2.0|It was ok but no academy award movie....  It was a Good girls type of movie for a Saturday night.
B007L5LD9O|5.0|Gweneth Paltrow was fascinating as the well-meaning but flighty Emma. The movie was stunning and beautiful on our HD TV. It was one of those stories that ended with an Ahhh! from the viewer, which was me.  -RDN
B004GYY714|5.0|Great way to listen to JackFm radio. Easier to navigate than other apps. Will download on smartphone and recommend to others.
B003BH7R32|3.0|Every track on this album is awesome, but there is only a few songs plus remixs, your money is probably spent better on another album.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Most intrigueging story lines i have read(listened too) in years=I'm 83. i have a reading problem, so booktapes are my main source<br />being able to raad.
1742204120|3.0|I've used Lonely Planet India guide for many years; I don't like their new format. Since I am not yet leaving for India, it's difficult to say if the information is accurate, but it is for the places that I've already been to/hotels I've stayed at/restaurants where I've eaten.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun way to pass time and can be used online or offline. The only downside are the commercials played before each game when online.
1843913720|5.0|This was a book that I had enjoyed reading and was sure another family would enjoy it also.  They did enjoy it also  and are going to pass it on to others to read.
1465001107|5.0|It's Michael Jackson!  What more can I say? :)  I love looking at the calendar every day and seeing Michael!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Bought this for my wife on our anniversary, she LOVES Michael Buble and says this may be his best album yet!
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Nice app to access your email from Gmail. Much better than going to internet and logging on. Simply click on app and email becomes available instantly.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Love. This. Series. Great acting and intriguing scripts. I love the twists and turns that weave throughout. Wish there were more episodes!
B00GD5F5LA|5.0|Just a great overall sexy teen angst comedy about trippin' through the best and worst of Europe. Plus, who can forget the Scotty doesn't know song?!?!
1595827684|5.0|Love it! Beware spoilers if you haven't played through all three games. The art is phenomenal! If you loved the Mass Effect games or even if you're an aspiring or professional artist who gathers art books for inspiration, this is a great addition to your bookshelf.
B004LQGXPA|5.0|A true classic set in an era of pride and accomplishment in American history.  George C. Scott nails it!  Brilliant!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a fun app. I would recommend this to my friends. Plus I received 110 free coins for downloading this app.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I gave it the five-stars because once I started it I couldn't put it down. I always like it when an author incorporates previous characters into their stories.  This wasn't necessarily a sequel to &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; (which is also a five-star book) but I think anyone who reads this book would benefit from reading &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; first...or at least watching the movie.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|I'm a new listener-- this is the first album I've purchased by AWOL. They have a lot of good tracks on here, especially People and Kill Your Heroes. There's a lot of variation between their songs. A few of them aren't really my sound but I didn't let that affect my rating much.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Held my interest all the way to end of book. I have not read any John Grisham books that weren't captivating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I  love this game and so do my children. Very easy to play. And free!! I don't like the 24 hour wait to unlock the next levels....but worth it in the end.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Thought the movie was really great.  No wonder it won the Academy Award for Best Picture.  I highly recommend it.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Gregory Peck is amazing in his portrayal of Msgr. O'Flaherty and the supporting cast is great too.  Although the movie is 2.5 hrs. long, it flows well.  It's nice to see how the Catholic church, Vatican, and Rome played an important part in WWII.
0767903862|5.0|This book was a perfect companion as I traveled through Australia.  I spent every evening laughing out loud, sometimes to the point of tears.  Bryson's observations were spot-on.  Many of my Australian hosts told me they love this book too.  He doesn't pull his punches, but he clearly loves this country, and he helped me love it too.
1449410243|5.0|The humor in this book is amazing! If you like cats, this is the book for you and your friends!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love having my very own horse.Anytime I want I can ride , play and enjoy a fine bit of competition1
B00BE97ONM|5.0|An excellent psychological thriller. Fast paced and gripping. A real page turner with great action and well formed characters. A thrilling read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you live in the city like me then you can't really have a horse and I love horse's so this is a funny app for all
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Despite all the sexual adventures, I came to like both the characters and hoped they each could come to grips with the other one's problems.  They obviously really loved each other and that's what it takes to accept someone with internal conflicts.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As usual Grisham takes us on a murder adventure. While I had a sense of the final action, the read was still great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy Candy Crush because it's not a 'rushed ' game.  You play at your own pace.  Each level is different and I enjoy it to pass the time and to improve mind skills.  I think this game is great for all ages.
B00FXMGI0G|4.0|Not as funny or good as the first Red but still exciting with lots of action all through the movie
B002G1YPH0|5.0|changed my temps by 15 degrees across the board! installation instructions need some work though! all in all well worth the money!!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was such a nice story. I enjoyed all the characters, especially the children. I would recommend this book to everyone, young and old. The story begins with sadness, but with each chapter, goes on to bring better and better things. And, it has a glorious ending, of happiness.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've owned 3 generations of Roku players and the latest generation of AppleTV, and I can say now that Chromecast has Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Pandora, and HBO GO... this is the best media streaming solution (other than some custom-built open source system). The only thing missing is Amazon VOD, but really that's preference. The Google Play Movies works just as well.
B00FLNRN06|3.0|Ok but not as funny as I expected it to be with Jen in it I thought there would be more laughs
031623480X|5.0|Shocking and shattering info in this book that will help you to look at gluten infused products very differently.  I wanted to better my dietary intake to stay healthy.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I read for pleasure. Reading this was not a pleasure. Plot holes as big as a house, writing style was confusing, and the tragic ending made no sense whatsoever.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I was so impressed with the actors that I felt I was looking at the younger versions of the cast. Thank you boys and girls. How they found this actors must have been fascinating. Looking at Zachary Quinto and Pine and the others - well - what a thrill. The ending and comeback were fitting. The acting, well, so pleasing.
B00EY7MFKS|3.0|This show has potential, but it still hasn't hit its stride yet.  I hope the writers get it in gear soon, 'cause I don't think today's audience has the patience to let them wait for a second season to get good.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I got my Chromecast player and it was up and streaming in less than 10 minutes. My TV did not power it up directly so I needed to use the power adapter that came with the item. Once you log into their site, it will immediately identify the dongle and link to it. I tried it on Youtube, Google play and Hulu where it streamed easily. But not on Amazon video. Amazon, when will we be able to use this amazing device on Prime Instant Videos? If not, there is always Hulu and Netflix...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a cool game...hidden objects with lots of diversions. Definitely the best free app available. The plot is fun, the graphics are good. Well done.
1401938906|5.0|This book is AMAZING!! Pam Groat takes esoteric material and relates it in such a way that even my junior high school students would totally understand and be able to implement.  I have done the first experiment so far and was kind of walking around for a day with my jaw down to my knees--totally amazing. Can't wait to try the rest of the experiments--so much fun!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great graphics, Great hunting locations make it fun to play. great choice of hunting weapons  with great upgrades. recommend highly.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read and I highly recommend it to anyone. It changes the way I look at life.
B003E6LC6I|4.0|I really like this TV series.  Season 2 is very good but season 3 is the best so far.  Enjoy
B00B769XB8|5.0|Not how I remember the story lol
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is a master storyteller, but I think this might be his best ever. His characters are real enough to smell. The plot has twists and setbacks and surprises that upset the balance and keep a reader up late at night turning pages till the end, which is as satisfying as any recent novel.  Good storyline, strong plot development and quick pacing deliver an almost exhausting read.  Legal nuances and courtroom maneuvering, written with just enough mystery, place the reader smack dab on front row awaiting the verdict.
B0043URV8M|1.0|Enhanced CD: Enhanced content not available on OSX. Crashes every time. No response from WT support.<br /><br />Tried to contact Watertower (WB) to get resolved. No response.
B005LAII12|2.0|Still trying to finish it.  It would have been so much better if they had left the F#@$%^s  to about 1/4th  the foul language.  But then the writers would have had to use their brain to think of how to make it funny and hold the attention to the point of the movie.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I recommend this book. It was a plot with excellent pacing, quirky humor, believable characters and a real ending not just a set up for another purchase.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|Even better than going to the movies.  Great commentary!! This combination of commentary and a clean, clear print is exactly what movie buffs want.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game starts out nice and calm and then you get to the chocolate levels and it gets stressful. I would prefer it to stay more laid back.
B006UKC566|5.0|Great movie
B004LROMSO|4.0|good casting, this is an interesting take on young king arthur. good acting, i am sorry to see this series not continue on.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This one is a guilty pleasure for both of us. Interesting character development, pretty good plots, drama, a little comedy, a little soap opera, and maybe struggling to make it another couple of seasons, but a good watch overall.
B00004CWO8|5.0|So glad this was recorded for prosperity. The amazing Matthew Bourne is a &#34;seen to be believed&#34; choreographer. He transforms ballet into a theatrical event not to be missed.
B007JVJ3C4|5.0|Good movie
031623480X|3.0|It makes sense, but would be really difficult to limit carbs, especially this time of year.  Counting carbs is not my thing.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|This is a fun tapping, task completion game, but the pacing is weird.  Everything takes 2 minutes, so you spend a lot of time waiting.
B003GK22HA|4.0|If you like ancient Egypt , this series is a must read....careful with the sequence however, they are not written in order.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Good movie
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Think I'll read it again & try the experiments as I write down the beautiful quotes.  This book is an easy read - filled with real-life examples or possibilities making it simpler to relate to your life.  Enjoy!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|This book really took me into the world of a young boy processing some horrific events in his life, and then involving the reader in his first person account as he grows into a young man through his mid-20s. It is a treatise on art, love and life that keeps one turning the pages. My only disappointment came at the end. I think the author got tired of writing and her ending is less than satisfying-- if not downright ridiculous.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I FREAKING LOVE THIS BOOK/SERIES!!! Only read it because my girlfriend made me. Honestly it's a pretty good series, although pretty low reading level, but it's meant for younger readers, so there's that.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Good family film
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Very limited.  Not at all what I expected.  Luckily I was able to sell it on craigslist and get my full purchase price back.<br />Get an AppleTV instead.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's *The Signature of All Things*  is absolutely stunning, one of the best books I've read this year. Now I'm curious about whether fans of the author's best seller *Eat, Pray, Love* will feel the same way about *Signature* as I do. I almost didn't give this book a chance, because I so didn't enjoy the former. Just goes to say that one should never judge a book by its author!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Honestly haven't even read it yet. Just trying to rate all of my previous purchases. Technically I read the first 2 chapters and it's good so far!
B007XF0X6G|5.0|Action filled
0486266885|3.0|this is going to be a gift it was on her wish list  i thought it would be a little more thinker but i guess she wants to it was going to look like
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is s great book, along with the movie. This book has some great life lessons and valuable key moments.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Snuff was filled with Discworld fun and those sneaky morality lessons that Mr. Pratchett sneaks past you when you're busy contemplating the lovely lady Sybil's endowments. Who knew a race that collects their own snot could be so endearing? Snuff was a great read and I didn't want it to end. Well worth reading.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Good movie
B005LAIH4A|5.0|fun movie just loved it and any one with small or teenagers with will love this movie so funny sweet
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This was to be the climax of a great trilogy. I was somewhat disappointed because this volume seemed a little contrived.However, I enjoyed the read.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|To imagine this story being recommended for teenagers is beyond my comprehension.  Violent, vicious.  Gratuitous blood letting.  I stopped after the first book and have no intention of reading any others.
B00C1MLHRA|2.0|To begin with, spent $4 in shipping (and more to send back) for a product that is a Stereo only re-issue.  Product page lacked any info. on audio specifics and I wrongly assumed that being a Blu-ray disc the makers would take the opportunity and space afforded them to actually add value and produce perhaps a surround mix of this old classic. It seems that they've taken the easiest route possible, ala Mobile Fidelity, of making money by doing the least work possible. I applaud their attempt at exploiting the latest technology but am certainly disappointed with this offering. I'm sure there are people who yearn for yet another high resolution 2 channel re-issue of a 34 year-old chestnut but until they offer something new and worth the price, count me out.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Love this album.  I love the songs of the sea and the people of the sea. My favorite song is about the offer of becoming partners and filling the house with warmth.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Acting, directing, writing, and special effects are all the best in this series.  AMC has started a new golden age of TV.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's a fun game, mindless entertainment. It's like all the other adventure games. My kids play it and find it entertaining.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I would like to thank the makers of this app and let people know that this learning tool in today is world is worth gold. Communication is so important, anything that helps you have a better quality or simply help you engage it ; deserves praise, especially when is free. Must click download, you wont regret it, better than being on FB..at least you learn something.<br />&quot;the teacher can only be as good as the student&quot;
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|GaGa is on to something here. The whole concept is about putting ART into mainstream culture, a reverse Warholian concept: making Marilyn the canvas vs. putting her on it, putting the soup can back on the shelf. Hence ARTPOP. Something our culture needs as it seems art is slowly dying and people are quick to judge what is right and what is wrong. And the best part is, she doesn't care what anybody thinks. She's following her heart.<br /><br />Now, some say the music's lyrics aren't very artistic. I agree, but the album is also a celebration for her and her fans. Life after Born This Way. But there are a few songs that are magical with their lyrics (Aura, Venus, ARTPOP, and Applause).<br /><br />Defanitily purchase this album of you're looking for amazing dance music and a hell of a good time. Start the music, stop the drama.
B000T433CO|5.0|I love this movie...so now i can watch it on prime whenever i want...Great family movie..Actors are Phenomenal & music By Hans Zimmer is Devine
B002VRZEYM|5.0|It's amazing scary how we have allowed big corporations to manipulate the foods we eat. &#34;Food, Inc.&#34; allows the consumers make informed decisions about what they eat. A real eye opener!
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Simon Cowell did an amazing job putting this group together.  The blending of talented voices creates an experience for great listening, over and over again.  I look forward to their next release.
B005M2A4D4|3.0|I love the box set but in my opinion this isn't the best season. I came into Doctor Who right before the rest of season seven started airing, watched the first several NuWho seasons and thought it was the most bizarre and wonderful thing. At times season six feels more like I'm watching a strange spinoff about Amy and sometimes, River. No spoilers but this is the season where things get weird, even by Doctor Who standards.<br />The first five seasons had me enthralled and glued to my TV. This season had me confused (I was watching BBC America edits) more than excited. I'm guessing this is also when they started splitting up the season. As someone who watched the entire new series fairly quickly I felt that the episodes in six didn't flow together quite as nicely as they did in the previous seasons. Things didn't go as smoothly, it seemed like maybe the writers were rushed and maybe things weren't as well thought out. When it's good, it's pretty enjoyable. In my meaningless opinion, this should have been the end of Amy and Rory. They should have retired from the Tardis because by the time they left the next year I was actually glad to be rid of them. Then we had the horrible and unnecessary trio of Madame Vastra, Jenny and Strax. They bring nothing to the show. This is the season that made me hate River Song. This is the season The Doctor stops behaving like the Doctor and he's more of an unhinged psychopath who becomes quite unlikeable at times. River was a dangerous nut job and he enabled her. What happenes to The Doctor who resents violence? The Doctor who hates guns? Nine and Ten would not have put up with River's childish, dangerous behavior. They would have wanted to help her and tried to show her a better way. Not in Moffat's Who. I won't get into detail over my problems with his writing. Google it, there are plenty of others who have the same issues. Had I been watching this as it aired I would have been rather frustrated and may have quit after that disaster of a finale.<br />Review edited to update my feelings after having more time to process the season.of a finale.<br />Review edited to update my feelings after having more time to process the season.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of the best books written. Don't be scared away by the fact that it was written by Stephen King - this book is full of historical information surrounding Kennedy's assassination. Reading this book is worth every page - don't pass it up.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Such a great story to show the power of understanding one's own brokenness and the power required to live with it. Great addition to The Shining
B0035G0U2O|5.0|Amazing graphics...Highly action packed...Great actors & actresses...two thumbs up...Quality picture & clarity. ..Good Price for this great movie. There was so much detail in this movie..Couldn't take your eyes off for a second
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|50% of the book was awesome and made me turn pages non stop.  25% was good enough to keep me awake and the last 25% had me asking what is the purpose or connection to the story.  In the end those questions weren't answered, but I understand they may be answered in other books....
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Daughter likes this series and wanted this series for her DVD collection.  Helps her relax from her profession of helping other people.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Loved all the back stories throughout this book.  Must confess, purchased this book after hearing him speak at a conference and he writes just like he speaks which I thought was amazingly entertaining.  So, in addition to recommending this book, while maybe not a total 5 star,(wish I could give 4.5) I would recommend searching out the videos online via YouTube.  I believe he also has a Ted Talk.  One if the best hours I've spent was listening to him at the conference and truly seemed like a Happy guy - appropriately so!
B005MLP71Y|5.0|Cute & funny...Kids Love it..Good quality picture.Great price. Nice movie to watch with whole family...will reccommend to my friends ..Beautiful graphics

B000OLGCI4|5.0|Loved this movie when i was a kid...Love Baloo & Mowgli..singing..Beautiful..Kids watch this all the time.<br />Good Condition...Great Price...Good Quality Picture...Fast shipping
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I believe this book was one of thee best romance stories ever. It has been called all sorts of things but not its true discription.  It is a romance story not a romance novel. I believe if you start with the first book and consider the sex in it as a description of what Christian's mind set is at the time and not x-rated you'll agree with me. I think it was criticised in the same manner that Love Story was years ago. Ladies, this book will bring you the same emotion that Romeo and Juliet or even Ghost did. If you didn't have a reaction to the commitment of two people needing to change and become what they think the other needs, then don't read any of the trilogy. If you wish to read a great book, please get all three. You will want to read them all. My only other comment is........E.L.James please continue the story. Also,  the model Ryan Cooper has the Christian look. Don't you agree? Just check out the Nautical ads in most magazines.
B005BOHYW2|4.0|A very interesting and entertaining read. The main character was explored well and the author showed great understanding of the kind of emotional scarring that a deprived upbringing can leave. There was a definite feel good factor about the book and perhaps everyone was a little too forgiving and too generous to be true but this did not detract from the overall enjoyment
B00ESB6GBY|4.0|it is not the best season. I love the show, but being all about the wedding is just to tedious.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I chose 5 stars cause this movie was hillarious & funny...It was for my kids & they absolutely loved it...Great graphics...Lots of action & great picture quality as well
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great Dual shock controller. Mine wore out some and the buttons do not respond as fast as they once did, so I needed another one. So I saw this and bought it.Works Great and Dual-shock makes things feel better.Great Controller
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found the main character fascinating. The characters in the book were brought to life and I think the author was at pains to make sure that the reader understood the psychology behind the actions of all of them. The plot was interesting and unfolded well. i appreciate that some bad language was needed to enforce the personalities but I  think the author should appreciate that sometimes less is more, and the swearing would have had more impact if it was not so abundant- shame, because it stopped me giving five stars.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game. I have the app on my kindle and my iPhone. It is an addicting game. It is free so download it.......even it it cost I would pay for it!

B0031R5K72|5.0|This book held my attention from the beginning to the end. The characters were explored well and the main character was brought to life with real understanding and empathy. The idea behind the book was sheer brilliance. I cannot praise it enough
B00EPFEY44|5.0|I loved it!  The CD is great with some of his greatest songs.  The DVD shows scenes from Portofino with adds to the enjoyment.  I was not expecting the DVD - that was a fabulous surprise and it has different songs from the CD.  Best buy I have done.<br />Sheila
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Entertainingly adorable, i did not expect much from it because it seems like the same old story, but we were pleasantly surprised  at how well this was done and we loved it
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a relaxing thing to do when I have some time.  The only thing I don't like is that they want you to spend money to earn things and there should be a way to earn them by doing something in the game.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I read some of the reviews but so far I haven't had the problems reported. I'm glad. But I like this app so far. I live in an area that is hot &amp; hot.

0812550757|2.0|boring,<br />don't expect an ender's game type book.  expect tree huggers and tears, but not your own tears.  Probably will still read the next book in the sequence but i will not set the bar as high as it was set after reading enders game.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|There should be an opt out button as I will NOT pay to get past a level maybe a high button say 50- 76 tries on a level

B00821OX98|5.0|This starts off sorts slow and was hard at first for me to get into this series.  However after watching first two episodes this series really pulls you into the story!  If you love scifi with action this is a great series for you!

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|You can't beat a great true story of heroism from WWII. Facinating how it all ended. Amazing to have survived againt the odds.
1590171993|5.0|A stunning novel on all levels, especially for its moving prose. This novel is unforgettable for its depiction of Professor Stoner, an awkward but passionate intellectual who learns the value of pitiless hard work growing up on a farm and remains amazed and grateful to be allowed to live the life of the mind.<br /><br />In mid-century America, the state universities still reward great teachers like Stoner, whose research is stymied--a casualty of his terrible marriage and home life. At that time at least, his efforts to enlighten thousands of young Missourians in the classroom is considered ample contribution. Resentful colleagues and a grand love affair with a brilliant student lend conflict and passion to what would otherwise be a quiet academic career.<br /><br />Despite years of emotional rejection at home and conflict in his department, Stoner rejects the idea that his journey has not been worthwhile. He has lived passionately within the narrow confines of his life, and what more can anyone hope for?<br /><br />Novels about the academy lend themselves to irony and satire, but Stoner reaches out to readers who are not just content with getting the joke at the expense of a story's characters. And anyone who has ever taught at a college or university will find this narrative ferocious in its portrayal of the forces at work in those cold halls.<br /><br />Rebecca Burke<br />Writer, When I Am Singing to You
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Boring, no depth.  Watched young man run through pretty scenery with occasional predictable CG creatures attacking him.  Will Smith got to do a film with his kiddo. That's great, but in the end it is just a family film for the Smiths
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|scares the pants off you when you realize some nutcase might really try this. got to the point that sleep did not matter- finishing the book did
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite books of all time. It just kept getting better and better! I was enthralled by all the characters and I literally couldn't stop reading!<br />Warning: if you choose to make a really good decision and buy this book, don't plan on doing anything until you've finished every bit of it.
B00FPH51LQ|4.0|IT WASN'T AS FUNNY AS I WAS HOPING, BUT I ENJOYED IT. WATCHED IT WITH MY PRETEEN KIDS AND IT WASNT INAPPROPRIATE
B005651RDS|2.0|I wanted to like this book more, but it took a while to get into it. Some books you just don't want to end- this wasn't one of them.
1577314808|1.0|I've read a lot of spiritual books, and this one seriously bored me to sleep.  My sister was having trouble sleeping, so I gave it to her and sure enough, it put her right to sleep like a mom singing a lullaby to a baby.<br /><br />So many people rave about The Power of Now, but its just ok.  There are better spiritual books out there.

030726999X|5.0|Just brilliant! Amazing sequel to the dragon tattoo. Had me hooked from page one. Finished it within a day or two
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is fun ,however I don't like that they want you to pay cash for more lives or power ups. I will not pay to play.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|Well done movie that fans will like. My kids loved it. I like her music and I also liked the movie.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|If like the blues, you'll love Joe Bonnamassa. Talented and a great choice of songs. I'd love to see him live.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|Admit it. Some of you have been waiting for this one. I know I have. If you saw \\"The Hunger Games,\\" you will remember that in this battle to the death, our two representatives from District 12 had to pretend to be in love in order to get sponsors to provide some much-needed supplies necessary for their survival (and victory). Now the Panem government wants to see them marry to prove that it wasn't a hoax.<br /><br />The problem is, The Capitol senses a rebellion brewing and thinks our heroine may be the inspiration, so they announce The Quarter Quell which will pit contestants drawn from previous winners. She is certain to have her name drawn as she is the only female winner from District 12 in the past quarter century. So much for that \\"lifetime of plenty\\" she was promised.<br /><br />Some of these are returnees from the first episode:<br />  * Jennifer Lawrence (Oscar for \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\") is back as Katniss, the role model I wish tweens would emulate: Her first instinct always is to help; she is genuine; she's smart; and she's resourceful. AND she has become the unwitting symbol of rebellion in Panem.<br />  * Josh Hutcherson (\\"Red Dawn\\") is Peeta, her partner, and, to make their story look real, her fiance. This guy is steadfast, strong and soooo much in love with her....<br />  * Liam Hemsworth (\\"The Last Song\\")  is Gale, her first love, still working in the mine back in District 12, taking care of her mother and sister and trying to ignore the publicity about Katniss and Peeta's pending nuptials.<br />  * Sam Claflin (\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\") is Finnick, one of the other contestants. Is he an ally they can trust or an enemy who will stab them in the back?<br />  * Lenny Kravitz (\\"Precious\\") is the wonderful Cinna, the designer who created the marvelous dress that launched Katniss as the Girl on Fire. This year's design is even more provocative. Wait until you see it!<br />  * Donald Sutherland (\\"The Hunger Games\\") returns as President Snow, walking a fine line between assassinating Katniss outright (which might inflame the rebels) and trying to outwit her (which he's fairly confident he can do).<br />  * Stanley Tucci (\\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\") once again is the perfect television host: smarmy, overly enthusiastic and completely despicable.<br />  * Elizabeth Banks (\\"Pitch Perfect\\") This time her Effie Trinket seems to have grown a heart. Whew!<br />  *  Woody Harrelson (\\"Seven Psychopaths\\") still is Haymitch (and he still drinks too much). He's the only former winner of the Hunger Games from District 12 still living and as such, serves as a mentor for our two contestants.<br /><br />This is a battle of wits, guts and gumption. It is PG-13 because of the grisly idea behind the games, although we rarely see blood. There is a sprinkle of profanity but it is warranted when used. We mostly see resourceful (and loyal) young adults in a battle for their lives. They remind each other, \\"Remember who the enemy is.\\"<br /><br />This is exciting, involving and we have a LOT of people to root for. I haven't named all the principal characters in this 146-minute epic, but I must warn you, there are no dull spots when you can take a quick break, so do NOT drink too many liquids!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the third (and fourth) episodes, \\"Mockingjay.\\" Suzanne Collins' final book in this trilogy has been split into two $creenplay$. I guess my set from Amazon will total 4 DVDs.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game. I think what I like the most is that I can set different things to be done and come back later when I have time. I also love making things and this game has a lot of stuff for you to make. Keep up the great work!!
006202406X|4.0|A solid conclusion to the trilogy, but still a step back from the first book. I loved the pace of the book...but a lot of things were predictable. Action scenes felt like an afterthought. There are some great lines towards the end about loss...things that you will take with you.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|GREAT!! Unfortunately when I got this I did not pace myself, I was up until 3:30 AM watching the whole thing! Luckily, I'm retired.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is a MUST READ for people who are interested in the nature of what humans are capable of achieving. An extremely interesting story of courage,and times of failing, but achieving huge success through never giving up. The life story of a REAL LIFE HERO without any doubt at all. A book that many people will read more than once...
B005MMY9A8|5.0|A fantastic, fun movie and very well done by all involved. I can't wait to see the second one!! Thankfully it's out now!
0385373791|5.0|Fast paced and lots of action throughout the trilogy. Kept me guessing. I liked this trilogy more than the Divergent trilogy. Strongly recommend this trilogy if you like fast paced books and action.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I think that this game is awsome ,because you can race and be a robber.<br />You can go to night clubs .
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is one of the greatest SF shows  ever and the movie (Serenity) tells the hole story , I  enjoy this and I think its a shame that thy were canceled so soon . Give it a shot and see for yourself.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Fun quick read. Nothing super serious. Kinda similar to Twilight. . . Save it for summer or a long winter vacation.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|loved the twist to the story more towards tge end of the book and how the author ties all the lives of each character together and makes a connection with a lesson to their respective situations..great read!
B00C5R8364|1.0|I have long been  a Forsyth fan. His first three fiction books, The Day of the Jackal, The Dogs of War and The Odessa File are masterpieces of the genre. I have read them any times. I also love his recent book The Avenger. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for The Kill List. I found it hard to identify with the characters or even care what ultimately happened to them.<br /><br />I remain a Forsyth fan but this book was a dissappointment.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is fun and awesome, but I was hoping it would do more then what it does. It works great with netflix and youtube but if I try and stream a video from a website onto my tv, it will not work well. Its very jumpy and slow. I have decent internet speed, I dont know if its the chromecast or the tv, or if the chromecast just cant stream video from anywhere but certain sites. I would love it, if i could use this to watch ABC.com and CW.com for shows they have on their site.
B001NLKZUA|2.0|The first book was a lot more interesting. This is edging into the incest realm. Even if it had to do with step siblings it would kinda cross a line. Won't be recommending it to my students.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|This movie ROCKED<br />I had been waiting months to go see it, so my expectations were high<br />It was not a let down. It was everything I hoped it would be.<br />The acting was great, especially that of Woody Harrelson, and Elizabeth Banks. (not going to mention Jennifer Lawrence or Josh Hutcherson, as their good acting is a given)<br />Finnick was perfect as was Johanna. Just as I had pictured them in the book.<br />The cinematography is great, but the fire affects still need some work...<br />Their was enough of the book for the movie to be good, but not so much that it was wayed down. Though I think the Avox's should at LEAST get some mention.<br /><br />Catching fire may turn out to be the best, but their are still two* more movies, so fingers crossed<br /><br />*Mockingjay is being broken into two parts<br />Oh, and twice while in the theater, about half the audience broke into applause. I wonder why...
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Using this on my Samsung Galaxy S4.<br /><br />Good feature set, good choice of sounds, love the various timing settings, the sound mixer is very good as well (it is limited to 5 sounds per slot but that's enough for me), and even the no-burn-in clock for my LED screen works great. Easily my favorite of the Android sleep sound generators I've tried so far. And I haven't noticed any repetition - something that usually drives me nuts with these sorts of apps.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I loved the movie and listening to ABBA sing the songs afterwards just didn't bring back the fun memories of the movie.  Now the songs are there with all the vibes and energy of the movie and it doesn't even matter if Pierce sings off key.  It's always fun to listen to.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|A little on the predicting side but overall beautiful! I look forward to a part two, married life in pride.

B003VDY7XE|5.0|In all truth I started out not liking this show and I couldn't tell you why.  It was certainly right up my alley as far as the kind of shows I like goes.  But as I got further into the series I have found that the story lines have gotten better and better which is unusual for a TV show.  Usually they start weakening by the third season.  So I wanted to go back and rewatch fron the beginning.  Thanks to Amazon I am able to do that.

Straightforward, no-nonsense, and endlessly applicable, they cut through the fluff and offer practical tips for writing better stories. Snyder's beloved Save the Cat! is certainly no different. He entertains even as he shares tips on structure and character and little, memorable bits such as his &#34;Save the Cat&#34; and &#34;Keep the Press Out&#34; slogans.<br /><br />Is there a bit of formulaism here? Sure. But even for authors who completely balk at the notion that stories fit into certain time-worn formulas, the practicality of what's mentioned throughout this book is still something that can be adapted by just about any screenwriter, novelist, or short story writer. Highly recommended.
B008LXZFH6|1.0|I didn't get the humor. I don't think I was the target demographic. Did not laugh once the whole film.  At least I know now that I probably shouldn't go see the sequel!
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|It doesn't live up to what I would expect for a bond movie. It starts out with a chase scene before introducing the main characters, I thought that was a mistake. I don't particularly think casting was spot on, choosing this man as Bond. He needs to be more of a ladies man like Connery. To be frank, this man is better cast as a serial killer, his face has a creepy essence to it with those ice cold eyes.<br /><br />All through the film, so many places were executed ok, but didn't have the proper construction for real suspence or excitement, that &#34;it&#34; factor that's hard to define to a lay person, but when it has it, you know it.
B00E6895M6|4.0|very different type of album from these guys. very hypnotic and catchy. would recommend to those who want to hear something different and have a decent sound system
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This is a fun addictive game filled with many challenges. Some levels are hard to beat, they seem like the only way to beat them is to use real money to purchase the different tools. Eventhough I'm. addicted, I can only give it 2-1/2to 3 stars. But do try it for yourself.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|An inside view of one of the world's most exclusive fraternities.  Love that the Bush Family \\"adopted\\" Bill Clinton.  Delightful, revealing read.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Snakes and Arrows is better than Clockwork Angels, and that's saying something.  More personal, less fantasy, texturally rich, architectural, very mature musically and lyrically.  Where they insert blues riffs into the mix or instrumentals into the set list actually works.  Long and calming, it's great coding music.  I've been a Rush fan since 1981 and love most of their work.  It took me a while to appreciate this album, but it's quite possibly their best work.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|This movie gave me the chills it was along the lines of the exorcist at the end. So many strong acting roles and incredible special effects
B000002IZM|5.0|Been a favorite of mine for years. Absolutely brilliant. Perfectly fits and enhances the mood of the movie. A great work of art, just the like movie itself. When I think \\"movie soundtracks\\" this and \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\" are the first ones that pop into my head.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|What a time to pick up this book - I really didn't realize when I did it. 50 Years ago today I was sitting between Chipper and Hoss, holding hands as our teacher cried and the principal's voice broke over the intercom. It was my Pearl Harbor, my kid's 9/11. This book took me where I never thought of going. Of course it is excellent - it is Stephen King - but it's more than that. The research alone is incredible (which Mr. King acknowledged) and I understand I owe thanks to Joe for the ending. Yes, you should read this book.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Great songs, terrible production/mix. Seems like Nick R. likes to throw a wet blanket over the whole mix. The original mixes of Caravan and BU2B were way better. Now they sound all muddied and bass heavy like the rest of album. Snakes and Arrows had a great mix. What the hell happened? I'll give it 5 stars when they remix it in 2023.
B00GT4V5DM|5.0|If it's from Malwarebytes  it has to be good!<br /><br />Would never use a PC with out it. Free it's a no brainier!
B000F8O2OM|2.0|Same as the last one didnot recieve the newer version dvd set.  Made me go out and buy the right one from barnes and noble.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Gripping, if somewhat implausible, with a good ending. Be prepared for an emotional evening with material that may be disquieting for some. Not for casual viewing or for faint of heart air-travelers!
B00CXQL828|5.0|An album review, without all the specific reasons, boils down to this-how often do you listen to it? Whether it's the songwriting, musicianship, production, length, whatever, I have been listening to this 3 or 4 times a week since I bought it months ago. It must be a 5. Can't deny that even if I wanted to.
B00CM9JIZ0|5.0|I am a huge of this band...always have been.  It's clearly their best disc since Empire as well.  Although most of their discs have something redeeming about them, sorry folks...the three discs before this one...just put me off me all the way.  The tunes, Geoff's voice, etc. I was SUPER skeptical about how this new venture would turn out with Todd...but it's just kick-ass ...all the way around...period.  I honestly love every tune on the disc, a few things that I am not nut's about with the production...but NOTHING matters more (to me) then the tunes...and these are great, great songs!  I also have seen them 2 times this year and interviewed them in Sheridan Wyoming (of all places) at their gig in June there.  I think...the band is back and better than they have been in 20 years.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|I found this book unsatisfying. I am wondering what all the hoopla was about. I actually said, \\"That's it?\\" When I finished. I found it wanting. I felt it offered little evidence of character growth, was shallow and vague at many points. If you are going to do the crime, be ready to do the time..especially when you come from a privileged background. Just didn't feel enough redemption here, just whining.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|it was another good Grisham novel that maintained certain characters from past books. His legal knowledge adds to the believeability. It did drag a bit at the end but it ended well.
B00EHIELXS|4.0|This book makes it so much easier to organize and deliver compelling presentations. Analyzes all the best TED talks and discovers what makes them stand out; does the legwork so you don’t have to. Breaks down larger patterns into actionable steps and talks about the pros + cons of certain trends. Really recommend it for those new to public speaking.
0061906220|5.0|Pete the cat makes learning to read fun.  Is Pete the cat like that other, tired old cat?  Goodness no!
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary is much easier to use than another I had tried.  I'm very pleased to have it both on my iphone and Kindle Fire.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|Real magic pretending to be fake in a competition to the death (or not). Selected as children and taught magic, Celia and Marco find they must outlast the other in the circus of dreams. I enjoyed the fantastical nature of the story.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I like to play the ocean sounds when I feel stressed...it really is relaxing. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can't continue to use your device without the sounds shutting off.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Epic.This game allows me to play with my favorite minions and more.I also got the latest update and need coins to the mall.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Basically, I just wanted to see why my niece called me Uncle Marvin.<br />Well, now I know. I am most certainly retired. The rest...lol.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Keeps you wanting to read more always know what's going on our it might get confusing love this book ya
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|The special effects are amazing and the story line of the relationships involved were good. Overall this was great entertainment
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Humor with heart, campy yet cool, this tale of a time lord and his companion(s) has to be one of the best TV shows in recent memory.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I rated this book 5 because you feel like you are one of the characters! I felt like I was running along side them the whole time! Not too give away the ending but I sobbed for 30 minutes straight. It's miserable when you end but outs worth it. By far the (second) best book ever read! (Best was scorch trials, for future reverence)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you so much for creating this game!! I'm constantly checking my kindle to see if new lives have been loaded! This is my private &quot;FREE&quot; getaway when the kids and grand kids are &quot;CRUSHING&quot; my nerves! Lol
B000SGSU58|5.0|All his books are good strong stories - love Harry!! and Mickey too!  I always look forward to his new books too.
0374533571|5.0|Loved this book!  who knew you could combine mental illness, the NFL and Catcher in the Rye.  I hope to get to see the movie!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Now i can record and take pictures of a good quality this is a good app for taking pictures because u can zoom in
B001JI8IJW|4.0|Good solid acting, action sequences, and direction.  All in all a good movie.  Good plot also.  One that was believable.
B005PK56TA|3.0|The story became a bit hokey at the end of season 1. It was an odd out of the way  storyline anyway but it kept my interest until it petered out at the end.
B00G70J81O|5.0|It's a great movie that just focuses on Wolverine and gives him a better action movie. And it gives a good story.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Well......nothing can be perfect, atleast as of now. The character itself is very complicated for masses to appeal, for which I think this was a worthy effort.
1451666179|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud so hard I was crying and couldn't keep my eyes open to keep reading.  My 15 year old son thought I was nuts, so I handed him the book.  Within 2 minutes, he was laughing hysterically and handed it to my 12 year old son, who, as I'm sure you've guessed, couldn't stop laughing.  Can you think of any text that makes a 12 year old male, a 15 year old male, and a 41 year old female all laugh out loud?  That is only skillfully achieved through quality writing, poignant satire, humorous observations about the human experience, and simplistic yet hilarious illustrations.  There is substance here.  In this stressed out life, I will be giving this book to at least 5 people this holiday season.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|First off, I wanna say this game is amazing in almost every way. For most people, THE fps on mobile, I'm sure.  But there's one little problem I'm running into that makes the game not wort<br />Lh playing. For some reason, it refuses to save my level up progress in multiplayer. I've played at least ten matches now, and every single time I exit and go back to the multiplayer menu, I'm back at level one. Every single time. Unless they fix this, be aware your risking seven dollars for a game that might not work.
B002J2PB10|2.0|My least favorite Tarantino film.  Had some nice touches, but I can easily see how this could be cut down to an hour for the Grindhouse double feature.  Watch some of the movies that Tarantino references (Vanishing Point) instead.
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|Not as good as Believe, but it's still Cher.  60+ and going strong.  So proud of her.  Will continue to support her anyway I can.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|A little slow, and of course set up for you to spend actual money to get upgrades, crowns, etc. faster, but a fun game nevertheless.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game has lots of goals and rewards. It's very colorful and the characters move around so that it doesn't look boring. I like this game a lot. :)
B008ALAHA4|4.0|Nice little $10 device that allows me to use all my extra previous gen macbook chargers with my new air. Great for traveling as well as I can find an older mac charger at most friends & businesses I visit.
B00FAZ01JU|5.0|First this is advertised as region 2 PAL DVD, (if true you would have to make sure your DVD player can play it before buying) BUT the DVD/Disk I received is Region 0 and will play on all DVD Players and Computers.. I am guessing a non import Region 1 NTSA version is coming (The Public TV version I have is region 1, also I have a DVD player that plays region 2 DVDs). ANDERA BOCELLI LOVE in PORTAFINO DVD  is a beautiful DVD of Andrea's live show in a courtyard in beautiful Portofino Italy. It starts with stunning aerial views of the surrounding area and Andrea Bocelli singing Il Nostro Incontro with Chris Botti guesting on the Trumpet, its a very beautiful love long. We see Beautiful Aerial views and views of the wonderful courtyard and surrounding buildings throughout the performance. All the songs hear are songs of romance, and we have songs done in Italian, Neapolitan (an Italian Dialect), Spanish, Portuguese, French and English. The concert starts just before sunset and goes to night, as the night comes all the surrounding buildings are alighted (and some are outlined with white lights) and look wonderful. We also get views of people on boats, looking at their windows at the concert etc., When you see it you will wish you were there.<br /><br />The second song is Senza Fina where Andrea is accompanied by a wonderful accordionist, the Third is a Neapolitan song called Anema E Core a very beautiful song accompanied by Caroline Campbell on Violin. The 4th Song is a very famous Spanish Song called Quizas, Quizas, Quizas which he does on his new Album Passione with Jennifer Lopez but hear he sings it solo with Caroline Campbell on Violin. Caroline proceeds to play to a table in the Audience and two (professional) Dancers get up and dance to the song a very nice touch. Next is (5.) A Mano A Mano (literally it means hand to hand but its figurative and means face to face) Another beautiful love song.<br /><br />The Next song (6.) is Perfidia a Beautiful Spanish song, Andrea ends it with a long soft beautiful tone. David Foster tells us about some of the luminaries in the Audience including Paul Anka and Michael Cain. The Seventh song is (7.) Champagne. David Foster tells us that he never heard this song before but its his favorite on the Album and it is just another beautiful song of romance. Lets face it Bocelli can sing twinkle twinkle little star and it would sound great. The Eighth song is (8.) Corcovado Quite Nights of Quite Stars a Beautiful song sung in Portuguese and is one of my favorites, Its just a beautiful smooth smooth song. On the album he sings it with Nelli Futado and hear live he songs it with a young Adorable Brazilian singer and star named Sandy. She has a very smooth romantic voice and is quite beautiful. Sandy and Bocelli's harmony is just fantastic and there is nice sax work in the song.<br /><br />Next up (9.) Is Tristeza with Juan Carlos from Cuba on Harmonica. This is a more uptempo and jazzy song, very cool. The Tenth song is a famous French song (10.) La Vie En Rose which is a duet Bocelli does with film of Edith Piaf who 19 December 1915 - 11 October 1963), born &Eacute;dith Giovanna Gassion, was a French singer who became widely regarded as France's national popular singer, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars.[1] Her singing reflected her life, with her specialty being of Chanson and ballads, particularly of love, loss and sorrow. Among her songs are \\"La Vie en rose\\" (1946), \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" (1960), \\"Hymne &agrave; l'amour\\" (1949), \\"Milord\\" (1959), \\"La Foule\\" (1957), \\"l'Accord&eacute;oniste\\" (1955), and \\"Padam ... Padam ...\\" (1951).  Andrea sings this song to his Love Veronica Barti and then She joins him on the Next song (11.) Qualche Stupido Ti Amo (something stupid), This is a well song song and is also done by many in english. Its not including on the CD, but is an extra track.<br /><br />Song number Twelve is a look back to Andrea's album with David Foster Amoreand the song is (12.) Besame Mucho, Before the song David Foster introduces the musicians who are all excellent and from all over the world. Song Thirteen is (13.) Love Me Tender the famous Elvis song done in English of course. Song fourteen (14.) Sara Settembre This is the Italian version of the song made famous by Neil Diamond's \\"September Morn\\" Bocelli wrote the Italian lyrics with permission from the songs writers Neil Diamond and Gilbert Becaud Stay. Bocelli goes a great job on this one.<br /><br />The Next song (15.) is When I Fall in Love done in English with a Beautiful German singer and star named Halana Fisher. Chris Botti also performs on this one. On the CD Passione he does this is a solo it is very nice as a duet as well. Song Sixteen is a great, fun and romantic Italian song called (16.) Roma Non Fa La Stupido Stasera (Rome don't be silly this evening) I never heard this song before and have to say I love it, It is my favorite on the Passione CD. The next song (17.) is Era Gia Tutto Previsto which is a Italian pop song that sounds more like a classical song, and that is followed by (18,) LOVE IN PORTOFINO which is just a beautiful song and a must do while doing a concert in Portofino. It is a wonderful song one of my favorites. Bocelli nails a beautiful high note to end it. Caroline Campbell also plays Violin on this one. The concert ends with the song (19.) La Mia Via (My Way) which is an Italian version of \\"(I did it) My way,\\" and its Just wonderful, the whole concert is wonderful!!!!<br /><br />This is a wonderful concert in a beautiful setting with the worlds greatest singer surrounded by excellent musicians and wonderful guest stars singing some of the worlds most romantic songs and is a must have for any lover of beautiful music.2.)
