B001S86J0I|5.0|The most marvelous thing about a gem like \\"Galaxy Quest\\" is how it manages to skewer - but gentle affection - science fiction conventions, a cheesy and long-canceled television science fiction show, the rabid fans of said show, the long-unemployed actors who played the leads in it, and yet at the same time tell a rather ripping-good yarn incorporating some genuinely moving moments.  (And Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Stewart and William Shatner have, at the very least, proved that they are jolly good sports about being ribbed so mercilessly.)<br /><br />A lot of the comedy in Galaxy comes from the casting - and not just that there were top-flight acting talents in the lead roles - it is the actors, playing actors, who are playing characters who are so deliciously off-type from their actor-persona. For instance, Tony Shaloub plays Fred Kwan, (passive and suspiciously substance-addled) who is cast as TSgt. Chen, supremely competent spaceship engineer. Alan Rickman is Alexander Dane, over-wrought Shakespearean, passionate about his \\"craft\\" - who apparently has hated every minute of being the lizardoid alien, Doctor Lazarus.  Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco - grounded and rather level-headed - is the sexpot Lt. Madison, the communications officer who apparently went through episode after episode repeating whatever the computer told her.  And Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith - self-centered and defiantly not the heroic type - is playing Captain Peter Quincy Taggart, of the NSEA Protector, who never gives up, and never abandons his crew. Along with Daryl Mitchell, as the grown-up kid actor Tommy Weber, once the helmsman Laredo, and Guy (Sam Rockwell), who had a bit part in a single episode, and \\"died\\" in true red-shirt Enterprise crewman fashion - all of them are transported into space, onto a ship which in every detail is the NSEA Protector. To their astonishment and horror, they are being asked to be the characters they only played, on behalf of the Thermians. The Thermians are a race of aliens who have unfortunately run afoul of a particularly brutal enemy, Sarris and his evil minions. The NSEA Protector is their last, best hope. Alas, although technologically sophisticated, the poor Thermians know not of story-telling and entertainment. And that's the plot - of the actors being given a chance to be what they only appeared to be, and the leader of the Thermians, Malthezar becoming what he wants to be - an inspiring leader. It's a movie that bears watching again, and again.<br /><br />Of the extras on this release, the funniest are the omitted scenes - Doctor Lazarus being given a tour of his quarters on board the Protector by the hospitable Thermians is hysterically funny. According to the commentary, some thought was given to showing the Thermian's idea of the other characters' quarters as well - which would have been also terrifically funny, but there are so many other comic scenes, lines and throw-away-bits that omission of that gag is hardly noticed. The other notable feature is a version of the movie entirely in the Thermian language. A little of that bit goes a very long way.liens who have unfortunately run afoul of a particularly brutal enemy, Sarris and his evil minions. The NSEA Protector is their last, best hope.

0374530718|1.0|We read Sophie's World for my book club.  Our group consists of three English teachers, two science teachers, a history teacher, a philosophy major, and an RN. We are not \\"fluff\\" readers, so we expected to enjoy this novel about philosophy.  Boy, were we wrong!<br /><br />None of us liked it.  It read like an introduction to philosophy textbook with unbelievable characters.  Most of us teach middle school and none of us believed Sophie's incredible interest in philosophy, her amazing knack at grasping such ephemeral concepts so quickly, nor her close relationship to her \\"mentor.\\"<br /><br />The idea of the outlying story was interesting, but poorly written.  Both the imaginary and \\"real\\" worlds in Sophie's World were so flat and unrealistic that it was impossible to reach the suspension of disbelief necessary to become engaged in the text.  I would not recommend this book to anyone for any reason.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|Much as I am loath to watch yet another TV cop show - having gotten to the point in the last decade or so when I could see about every possible plot angle coming in the first five minutes - and about every possible buddy pairing imaginable - my daughter talked me into this one. \\"Mom, it stars Nathan Fillion - Captain Mal! It can't possibly be that bad!\\"<br />And to my mild surprise, it wasn't that bad; quite good, in fact: not for the actual crime-solving puzzles involved, but for the play of personalities - Richard Castle, the celebrity mystery author and dilettante, and Kate Beckett, the driven and earnest police detective, working together and striking creative and almost-but-not-quite romantic sparks off each other. In a lot of ways, it's a throwback, not just to TV shows like Moonlighting, but to 1930's William Powell and Myrna Loy, in \\"The Thin Man\\" series - an engaging merge of the who-dunnit with firecracker wit, sexual attraction and glamorous Manhattan, into one delicious trifle of intriguing characters and snappy conversation.<br />The supporting characters are not neglected when it comes to delivering crackling good lines; notably Kate's work buddies, Detectives Esposito and Ryan, and the sharp-tongued medical examiner, Dr. Parish. Castle's personal life - he lives with a refreshingly grounded teenage daughter, and his mother, a flamboyant former Broadway star - rounds out the character of Castle. He is a good and responsible father, and possesses connections and skills - notably a writer's sharp observation and intuition about characters - which are a good fit for Beckett's determination and laser-sharp focus. In personalities, they are opposites: he is talkative, open, creative, whereas she is focused, stoic, and more inward. Part of the charm is how they act on each other - she opens up, just a little bit, and he seems to become a bit more responsible, as the season progresses.<br /><br />Of the extras included, the most amusing is \\"Write Along With Nathan Fillion\\" - where he and producer-writer Stephen Cannell spend the day together, in the interests of Fillion learning to be a mystery writer. It's almost as much fun as any of the episodes of the show.where he and producer-writer Stephen Cannell spend the day together, in the interests of Fillion learning to be a mystery writer.

Traver's telling. \\"Bedknobs\\" was released some five years later, incorporated animation and live-action, lively and rousing musical numbers by the Sherman brothers - who even teleported a musical sequence - the underwater fish dance-hall -  originally meant for Mary Poppins over to \\"Bedknobs\\", where it fitted in seamlessly.\\"Bedknobs\\" - which is fondly remembered by my own daughter -  featured a charming spinster with an affinity for magical adventures, three adorable and spunky children, a light touch of romance in the person of Professor Emilius Brown, played by David Tomlinson, who played the banker father in \\"Mary Poppins.\\" The plot - such as there is - is not quite as episodic, being that Miss Eglantine Price desires to complete her training as a witch, so that she can work a spell to defend England from German invasion. That is the thread which strings together hers and the children's magical voyage on a flying brass bed, through London's Portobello Road street market (and a wonderful dance sequence), through a magical underwater realm (the fish dance hall sequence)  and the island above it, where a slightly mad king of the animals presides over a knock-down and drag-out football game. The concluding episode - where Miss Price's spell animates a whole museum full of armor to defend Britain's shores from an invading German commando party is a creepily effective live-action sequence, but not without some comic pratfalls.<br /><br />Extras on \\"Bedknobs\\" are sketchy, in comparison to other recent Disney releases; a reconstruction of a song, \\"A Step in the Right Direction\\" which was edited out, and for which only the sound track and still pictures remain, the almost obligatory feature about the music with Disney's in-house composers, the Sherman Brothers, and an original recording session with David Tomlinson.

I was unsure what to expect as I had never read any of this authors books - only watched The Notebook.

This is one of my all time favorite shows, and I am very saddened that there will never be a next season.
B000002U9Y|5.0|I like \\"A saucerful of Secrets\\" a lot. It is experimental, it is psycadellic, it is spacy. Of course it is. This is what we wanted from PF in 1968.

I like to listen to the whole CD when I play it.   P.S. We would have been dissapointed if the '68 album would have been \\"Dark side of the Moon\\". We would have said \\"Too comercial\\" & \\"They sold out!\\". DSOTM is a perfect PF album for when it came out.

B0036TGSR6|5.0|\\"The Ghost Writer\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: When a successful British ghostwriter, The Ghost, agrees to complete the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang, his agent assures him it's the opportunity of a lifetime. But the project seems doomed from the start--not least because his predecessor on the project, Lang's long-term aide, died in an unfortunate accident. The Ghost flies out to work on the project, in the middle of winter, to an oceanfront house on an island off the U.S. Eastern seaboard. But the day after he arrives, a former British cabinet minister accuses Lang of authorizing the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA -- a war crime. The controversy brings reporters and protesters swarming to the island mansion where Lang is staying with his wife, Ruth, and his personal assistant and mistress, Amelia. As The Ghost works, he begins to uncover clues suggesting his predecessor may have stumbled on a dark secret linking Lang to the CIA -- and that somehow this information is hidden in the manuscript he left behind. Was Lang in the service of the American intelligence agency while he was prime minister? And was The Ghost's predecessor murdered because of the appalling truth he uncovered?    The cast led by Ewan McGregor (as The Ghost) & Pierce Brosnan (as Adam Lang) is excellent! The directing by Roman Polanski (who also wrote the screenplay and produced) (who also directed \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" (1968), \\"Chinatown\\" (1974) & \\"The Pianist\\" (2002, which won him the Best Director Oscar, he also produced) is excellent!

B001HOF8AA|5.0|I turned on the television just as Imelda was starting to sing How High the Moon with Jeff Beck at the Grammy's. I was immediately smitten, and after hearing this CD she's my all-time favorite female vocalist. Seriously. She's a great talent, has Elvis-like charisma, has worked like crazy for a dozen years or so, and is a tireless performer. Oh, and she writes a lot of her own material, too.     She's the freshest talent to hit the entertainment industry in a long time, and has earned everything she's achieved -- the hard way.     If you have a chance to see her live, don't blow it. She's worth any distance you have to travel to get there.     It's hard to imagine someone NOT liking this CD.
0060977493|2.0|At 321 pages this book took me a whole week to read when it should have only been a night.  I could only bring myself to read a chapter at a time it was so tedious to get through.<br /><br />It takes a brother and sister, twins, and jumps back and forth through their life.  Sometimes it veers into a little background of the side characters but overall it is about Rahel and her brother Estha.  When they are younger the tale is about the visit of their cousin Sophie Mol and her subsequent death.  So much of the book is leading up to her death that when it finally happens it is really quite anticlimactic and doesn't even grace a full page of the book.<br /><br />On the other side, one of the un-touchables frequently mentioned in the book has his beating and death graphically described for some time and the sex scene between him and the twin's mother is almost the whole chapter of the last book.  Neither of which alludes to the rest of the story as a whole.<br /><br />While Roy is lauded for her writing, I found that she used a few brilliant \\"literary\\" phrases; over and over and over and over.  To the point where I kept feeling like I was reading the same chapter again and again.  If I never hear or see the words \\"Puff\\" and \\"Two-egg Twins\\" again I will be exceedingly happy, as she seemed to use them on almost every page.<br /><br />As far as the plot of the book I felt that the characters were uninteresting or connect-able.  It felt like you kept reading to go nowhere in the story.<br /><br />Overall I just didn't like the book.  I know that many people do but my thought is that just because it is an important social issue, it doesn't make the book worth reading.  Those social issues could be better explored through better writing.

And OMG, the eye candy of the men is awesome......this is first series I've ever watched on STARz, never saw much value in that network, but now glad I've got it.  I sure hope to see  Andy Whitfield in a lot more series/movies in the future, he's got a great career ahead of him........what a phenomenal man.

(Plus she uses the D word in Overprotected)) are actually very appropriate for children.<br /><br />It's not a Britney CD you would most likely buy for your kids or if you're under 13, but it's still a pretty enjoyable album whether you've suffered a bad break up, are in love, or anything else. :)

There are times when we  worried and wondered if Hachi would make it safely through the day, and others when we felt warm and cozy, like this mutual affection would never stop.<br /><br />Of course, the calendar moves on and does sometimes bring bad news,but the love that<br />we have for dogs and the affection they have for us will go on forever, I believe.<br />Enjoy the movie and if you have a dog....or cat...at your side so much the better.<br />Earl and Chris and Avu
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Up is uplifting in more ways than one. It's the adventure of an old man (Carl) fulfilling his wife's dream and a cub scout (Russell) accidentally caught up in the adventure and forming a bond with the old man. The movie is moving, charming, funny and always enjoyable - no dull spots at all. The beginning is an exposition of Carl's life with his wife (Ellie) who he meets as a pre-teen and marries; they have dreams of adventure that gradually fade as life takes over. As is true on almost all films by Pixar this background story is moving and brilliantly done. If the rest of the film wasn't so much fun the introduction of the pre-teens 'til Ellie's death would have been the deserved highlight. But the story takes off when the old man attaches a huge numbers of balloons to his house and flies away! Our cub scout friend happens to be on the porch at liftoff. Their goal is a waterfall in South America where a famous explorer (Charles Muntz) was last seen. The first big surprise is Doug, a dog who wears a collar that allows him to talk in several languages. Doug is very funny, but it turns out he is only one of many dogs with the collars. A strange and wondrous bird, sort of a cross between an emu and a bird of paradise adopts them. Of course, this bird, Kevin, is what the missing explorer, Muntz, has been trying to capture for the many years he has been missing - which explains the talking dog collars. Not that anything in the film needs explaining. In an early sequence after meeting Doug, the dog is suddenly hilariously distracted when he thinks he sees a squirrel. This comic device is used to great effect in the film. In a scene where the menacing dogs have them trapped, our heroes point and shout 'squirrel!\\" which sends them off in a tizzy. The final use of the joke is in a scene of real tension as the dogs piloting their airplanes (I told you nothing needs to be explained) attack Russell in the flying house and it looks like the trouble is unsolvable. The kid shouts \\"Squirrel !\\" and the dogs collide with each other attempting to find the squirrel. It is a great payoff for using the running gag. Another dog gag is the use of \\"Fetch!' to escape. No need to tell you the ending except that the Kevin is a mother who goes back to her kids as soon as she heals from a dogbite. \\"UP\\" is as good an animated film as any I have seen - and I'm in my 70s and have seen them all starting with Bambi and every other Disney film. The humanity and humor in this film puts it high up on my list. Very high UP.<br />Herb GartSquirrel !\\" and the dogs collide with each other attempting to find the squirrel.

B000002UR7|4.0|I hated the song when \\"Creep\\" when it first came out.(Radiohead described this as the song that nearly ruined them, hmmm?)    Fast forward to now. I'm a huge Radiohead fan, (buying all of their other albums when they came out), and yes, I have minimally warmed to CREEP (only for nostalgia reasons). But, I avoided listening to Pablo Honey because I didn't like Creep that much. But last week, I decided to give it a try after getting it for my IPOD. It's really a great album. Even pre-Bends/O.K. Computer, their art/craft still shines through their melodies and their lyrics. My favorites I find myself singing (even after the IPOD's turned off) are \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar,\\" which is  a really nice anthem and just cool lyrics. ( \\"I wanna play in a band, when I get to Heaven. Everyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore...\\") I also liked Ripcord and Vegetable as well. There were others as well.     If you're a longtime Radiohead fan, don't make the mistake I did and pass this up. There are some gems on here that are worth listening too.

Swept off the streets as a young boy, Raizo is transformed into an unstoppable killing machine by a secret society known as the Ozunu Clan. The Ozunu Clan is so proficient at keeping their existence a secret that most people think they are only a myth, but the moment Ozuno assassins kill Raizo's friend, their days in the shadows are numbered. In the aftermath of that killing, Raizo stages a daring escape, subsequently biding his time until the day he can take the entire Ozunu Clan down. Visually this movie is incredible. It's unlike anything you've ever seen. The fighting is quick, furious and the story although not completely involving is involving enough so that you kinda like the characters. What this movie does explosively well is decapitate, disembowel and explode it's victims across it's blood soaked screen. It's an exciting piece of cinematic brilliance.  It delivers on its title, wicked weapons, killer moves and bloody battles at its all-time best.

B0013FSL0C|3.0|I would agree with all the other reviews that complement the excellent writing and acting that this series brings to the table. However, living in a world that unfortunately parallels the drama that these characters regurgitate, the show leaves the perceptive soul completely and utterly drained.  The doorway to the mind this series opens is toxic and provides no hope of any transcendent redemption.  Thank-you HBO for showing, better than any sermon from the pulpit could, just how sick we truly are when we have nothing to hope in other than pure intellect and self preservation.  Sadly, this is all \\"therapy\\", whether it comes on the couch or from a self help book, has to offer.  We debate Darwin vs. Creation as if \\"survival of the fittest\\" has no real relational consequences.  Are we all just highly intelligent animals? Without God, indeed we are and the behavioral science proves it.

B00005AWMF|5.0|You know you're in the presence of a unique artist when radio stations around the USA not only built a format around your music, but named the format after a line in one of your songs. The \\"Quiet Storm\\" format of soft jazz and sophisticated R'n'B began to appear in the 80's when programmers so fell in love with Sade (and other artists like Anita Baker) that they built entire programming menus around the music. This 1994 Best of Sade shows exactly why her sound has never been equaled by her many imitators.<br /><br />Only four albums into her career (and with only two more released since), Sade's impossibly smooth voice was part of what identified her music, but there was so much more. Her three piece band, musician/songwriters Andrew Hale, Stuart Matthewman, and Paul S. Denman, played a slick but authentic sounding mixture of latin-jazz, lite funk and slinky R'n'B that sounded like nothing else in the market at that time. Sade's ever so cool voice recalled Billie Holiday and Nina Simone; it wasn't long before she was tagged a diva in the making. They moved with ease between the pop of \\"Smooth Operator\\" and \\"Hang On To Your Love\\" and the brassy force of \\"Is It A Crime.\\"<br /><br />This collection does a good job of balancing the band's mix of songs from the four albums, with an added bonus of Sade's cover of Curtis Mayfield's \\"Please Send Me Someone to Love\\" from the Philadelphia soundtrack. It's also worth noting that Sade has never felt a need to bend their music to prevailing genres or trends; this is a best of that plays through with the consistency of a new album. Still smoking with the sensuality of the first time you heard [[ASIN:B000051XX7 Diamond Life]], The Best of Sade is music that has lost none of its allure with the passing of time.
0061703257|5.0|The worst thing I did was start reading Shutter Island. It was supposed to be a weekend of intense work, instead it became an Lehane obsession. I couldn't put the book down. I read it cover to cover in one day. It had a mix of everything I loved in suspense novels. I suspected the ending earlier as he dropped one or two clues, but when it hit I was like \\"no! no! no!\\". I still think about that book and shake my head. Loved it!
159562015X|5.0|Tom Rath's book and accompanying assessment make for an excellent (and efficient) way to gain a greater understanding of how you can stand out while feeling pride in your accomplishments. The StrenghtsFinder assessment is incredibly simple and quick. After receiving your immediate online results, this book is the perfect resource to find out more about each of your identified strengths. The quotes and action items associated with each strength are helpful in creating your own personal strategy while focusing on your strengths rather than your weaknesses. I was amazed at how accurately the assessment ranked my own personal strengths. Excellent resource to continuously use while looking introspectively as well as a great management tool. Definitely worth your time.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie in the theater, and was blown away by the beautiful art and 3-D effects.  As a visual artist, I found the art end of the movie to be incredibly rich, and went back to see it (and likely will yet again) just to LOOK at the world!  I could look at this for a very, very long time.  I am also a biologist/ecologist, so I appreciated the sources that they drew on to create this world - especially the incorporation of coral reef elements into the forest environment.  Nice concept!  (LOVE those tube worms!)    That said, I found the plot and characterizations disappointing. The plot was very \\"Dances With Wolves\\"; there was nothing really original about the story arc. As an ecologist, I liked the fact that the film pointed out the mistakes that we have made and are still making here on the only habitable planet that we know.  But I think this could have been done with a bit more of an original spin to the story.    Additionally, the characters (with the exception of Jake Sully) were very one-dimensional, and would have benefited from a bit more depth. Long as the movie was, I would have liked to see it split into two parts so more attention might have been paid to story arc and character development.  The film is beautiful and definitely worth seeing, but it is unlikely to become a classic that really holds up over time.    As to the Blu-Ray/DVD: Isn't there a way to convert the 3D done in the theaters to a standard HDTV?  I want those effects, but am unwilling to go right out and buy a new, very expensive 3D TV to get them, especially at the price they are now offered at.  THAT technology needs some time to mature and become more accessible to those of us who are not independently wealthy.  I don't know about the issues with the technology used in the theatrical release, but do not think I would buy this if I have to watch it flat.  Those 3D effects were a huge part of what really knocked my socks off about the film.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|I was searching for another great TV show to get into. I had stumbled across information on this show before but it didn't capture my interest initially. As a fan of the Fantasy genre, I felt that I have seen and read too much that a show would really have to be original to capture my interest. I have tried to get into other fantasy TV shows but it has been difficult because many are simply to cheesey.  I am glad I took another look at this show because it is one of my favorite of all time now.    I have only watched the first season but I was surprised how well-done this show is. The show starts off with a few cliches of the fantasy genre sticking out from it such as the obligatory white-haired wizard, the hero who is destined to save the world, the love that cannot be, etc., but as pointed out in a review below, by the 7th episode the show really starts to come into full swing and develops a personality of it's own and develops into an outstanding show!      The character development, chemistry between characters, writing, and productions is top notch. I just wasn't expecting the higher production value. If you are a fan of fantasy  you will love this show. It is what we have been waiting for.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary--though distressing to view at times--is a must see if you want to KNOW about the food you are buying--whether it  is wholesome --or not! It reports many questionable and unsafe practices by the food industry--and it makes me even more concerned than before about the way livestock and food get to our table!!<br /><br />Watch it! This documentary gives some good ideas of what each consumer can do about the problems!!  Then take some of the recommended actions and REMEMBER: every food dollar you spend is a VOTE to let the food industry know what you want!!  If your only concern is cheap food, you can get it! But at what cost to health and safety of our food supply!
0762434279|4.0|The book is a quick read on how to change your thinking from the corporate/blue collar view to the entrepreneurial view.   It is elementary on several points but mind blowing on others - it depends on where you're at in life.  I found it to be very interesting; it changed my thought process on how to go about making money and what that really means.  Buyer beware: the book is approximately two inches square.

B0017I1FNK|5.0|I just gotta say, i have absolutely NO idea how I ever even came across this album. I generally get into hip hop, indie and house music, but from the very first track of this album I was hooked. Something about the production says this isn't your typical country record. Her amazing voice kicks in and never backs down. The music is powerful but sparse, with only a hint of twangy \\"country\\" style guitar over the top. And Emmylou's voice is AMAZING! Its all gravelly and sweet at the same time, and the end result with this minimal modern production is beyond awesome. There are a lot of 'amazing' *yawn* indie bands out there right now making annoying repetitive music, who would KILL to have a sound as fresh, polished, genuine and beautiful as this record. I try and play this to as many of my friends as possible and so far not many have taken the bait (sadly). Except my one friend when I was drunk so for the rest of that night he was my best friend haha...    I'm just going to describe three of my favourite songs on the album. The rest are all preally good, however I wasnt too into kern river, take that ride, sailing round the room or across the great divide (I think they are all a little 'old school' country for me), I think the rest are all awesome and are on my ipod pretty regularly.    Hold On (10/10)    AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZING song! This is what I meant by her voice being gravelly and sweet at the same time. The music is very minimal guitar strumming with swelling bass tones that just lead to this epic feeling at the chorus. The \\"Hooooooold on. Hooooooold on\\" parts are probably some of the most beautiful singing I have ever heard. The lyrics are simple and heartfelt, and make me think of my mum. I would put this in the top 10 songs I have heard in my life.    How she could sing the wildwood flower (9/10)    This song grew on me a LOT. I used to live in a very remote island with an aging ex-hippie population, and this song takes me back to some of those \\"lonesome valleys\\", with their sprinklings of equal parts beautiful hippie ideals and also their kind of desperate isolation. The thing that makes this song so beautiful is the heartache it captures. The music is so minimal it really takes you to that place where the two try and make it work, where a young girl is taken to a place where they can live the life they dreamed of, but finds the loneliness to much. Really tugged on the old heart strings! Give it a few plays and you'll know what I mean.    All that you have is your soul (9/10)    Music in this is quite close to opener 'shores of white sand' nice sweeping pianos and string backgrounds, but what I LOVE about this song are the simple and powerful lyrics. \\"She said don't give or sell your soul away cus all that you have is your soul.\\" I feel if anyone but Emmylou was singing this song it would sound preachy and cheesy, but the honestness and reflection in her voice is amazing and really pulls you in. Just listen to it!    In short, buy this album, it stands on its own as a great piece of heartfelt modern music.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|Ever since Discovery started doing these re-narrations of the popular BBC nature documentaries, I have been confused and progressively more angered. Firstly, the fact that they even chose to take David Attenborough's narration out is insulting to one of the greatest naturalists ever. The fact that they could possibly imagine eliminating the man that basically MADE this genre of documentaries is just plain stupid and offensive and undermines Mr. Attenborough's lifelong work, which is especially terrible! Secondly, it makes us Americans look like simpletons who just want big hollywood names (that have nothing to do with anything relevant to this!) possibly in an effort to make us feel special or something!? Another possibility is that perhaps the marketing experts feel Americans are too stupid to understand British English or would be as closed minded to not purchase it because it is not good old \\"American\\". This is absolutely stupid. Everyone PLEASE just heed these warnings and buy the Attenborough versions also available and make the sales figures for the \\"American\\" version so miserable that Discovery finally gets the idea that we are tired of this crap!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|2012: 8 out of 10: I love disaster movies. I love good disaster movies such as The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure. I love bad disaster movies such as The Swarm and Independence Day. I even enjoy, if not love, Horrible disaster movies such as Syfy channel stalwarts Megafault and Magma: Volcanic Disaster.    2012 is solidly in the good disaster movie genre. As I have stated before in my The Core review Disaster movies always seem to do better when the disaster is local in scope. A city threatened by avalanche, a tower threatened by an inferno, a Poseidon threatened by an adventure, that kind of thing. Earth killer movies are always a harder road.    2012 dodges this bullet slightly by having neutrinos from a massive solar flare penetrate the Earth and cause the temperature of the core to increase rapidly. Like a microwave one scientist very helpfully explains. Of course why these same neutrinos dont cause the oceans to boil is a plot hole that the movie delightfully ignores. Still compared to The Core or The Day after Tomorrow, 2012s science is practically textbook.    Now since the core is expanding this causes the earths crust to erupt in different directions (think a Jiffy Pop container). This allows disaster footage from all over the earth. And we all know where disasters strike first. Thats right monuments. Vegas, Washington DC, Vatican City, Los Angeles, Yellowstone, Hawaii, and others get there turn in the special effects blender. The set pieces are generally well thought out often with sly commentary attached. (A giant rolling donut in LA, A slick atheist Where is your God now rub at the Vatican.). The special effects are all magnificent.    I will briefly talk about the actors in a minute (Generally speaking they all do fine) but the star is the effects. The detail work (as can be seen in the disaster porn pictures below) is simply amazing. Director Roland Emmerich puts his 250 million dollar budget on the screen. For once the buildings that collapse have people in them. The disasters do not happen in the rain or at night and the camera doesnt jerk around as if directed by an epileptic sugar glider.     The location work is creative as are the disasters. (Lets face it a tsunami driving an aircraft carrier into the White House is imagination at work.) In addition, the story is a fairly grounded version of that old When Worlds Collide plot where all the smart rich and good looking people get on a spaceship and escape Earth while all the less attractive people all die horribly.     The movie halfheartedly tries to address the unfairness of who gets chosen but we really didnt come for a civics lesson and honestly there are worse ways to go than just picking attractive rich people. We also didnt come for the acting, but unlike many of its contemporaries, the acting in 2012 seems solid across the board.     Some of the various side plots fall a little flat (especially considering the two and a half hour length, the old guys on the boat subplot could have been jettisoned in its entirety.) On the plus side Zlatko Buric as the Russian billionaire ex-boxer and Woody Harrelson as the crazy mountain man (doing his best Matthew McConaughey impression mind you) are the stand outs.    Overall we came for the disaster porn and simply put 2012 delivers some of the best disaster porn ever seen on screen, and manages this feat with fewer of the bad acting and horrible storyline distractions that usually accompany such films. Bravo.

1421527618|4.0|This novel is almost written to be read in one sitting.  I read it in 90 minutes, and cannot stop thinking about it.  The language is simple, and tries to get out of the way of the story the author wants to write, which is a RPG-Shooter game in light novel format.  While some reviewer complain about the ending, I have no issue with it.    I would love to see an anime adaptation of it.
B000J103PC|3.0|Well, I'm all over the map about this movie, I really am, finding something to agree with in almost every review here, including the least positive.    The positives are these: I adore the look and pace of the film, the to-die-for clothes of course, and the performances (first and foremost) of the great Meryl Streep as the towering, terrifying Miranda, the winning Anne Hathaway as the perpetually harassed Andrea, the dependable Stanley Tucci as Miranda's long-suffering, witty-wise second-in-command Nigel, and the wonderful Emily Blunt as the bitchy, put-upon first assistant...uh, Emily. All of them--especially Streep, Tucci and Blunt--bring both bite and (mostly hidden) heart to what could have been a collective phone-in of annoying caricatures. And though we really only get glimpses of him here and there, I also enjoyed Rich Sommers's endearing turn as Doug, the sweetest of Andy's circle.    I am seriously ambivalent however, about what the message of this movie is supposed to be, especially to women, and the alarm bells really go off when--SPOILER ALERT--Andy reconciles with her boyfriend, Nate, telling him he was \\"right about everything.\\"    What? What exactly was he so \\"right\\" about??    I don't know about you, but I found Nate, the boyfriend character, absolutely insufferable through almost the whole of the movie. I'm pretty sure he was supposed to be the voice of reason that tries hard to keep Andy grounded and remind her what's truly important. Instead he came off as a sulky brat who could not accept his girlfriend's growing pains as she struggled to cope with an impossibly demanding, first ever grown-up job that nothing in her easy-going schoolgirl existence had prepared her for. Were there no demands being placed on Nate in HIS choice of career? Was his job supposed to be the more important one?    Ditto Andy's best friend, Lily, who seemed to me increasingly more jealous of Andy rather than supportive of her. Lily too was pursuing Bright Lights-Big City dreams that demanded a lot from a young newcomer, after all, so how is it that she had such a hard time with Andrea's chaotic ups and downs? Where did Lily get off being so judgmental and disapproving? This is friendship? I watch these performances and can't decide whether actors Adrian Grenier and Tracie Thoms made poor choices in their playing of difficult characters or if the characters as written were simply impossible to like. Either way, both were a whiny pain in the rear, especially Nate, and Andy's mea culpas to him near the film's conclusion were tough to take.    No one disputes that Miranda Priestley was a Boss From Hell who routinely wiped her feet on her young assistants, particularly Andrea. But we also see that ultimately Miranda was as human as anyone else; a glamorous workhorse whose alley-fighter smarts hid real pain. And it should be said that Andy--who was in the beginning quite smug in her disdain of all the fashionista \\"shallowness\\" that surrounded her--had a knocking down or two coming. (I loved the way Nigel simultaneously comforted Andy and took her to task after an especially bad morning.) If Miranda put Andy through the wringer--and she did--well, she also taught her some important things (sometimes unwittingly) about hard work, hanging tough, and the choices we make in life to get to where we want to go or need to stay. Andy could have quit at the end of her first week (I think I would have) but no matter how bad or insanely silly things got, she didn't, at least not immediately. On some level she became aware that she was getting an education she wouldn't get anywhere else from anyone else, and there was value in that. I think she knew that; I hope she knew that. I hope the audience does, too.
006621131X|5.0|I was entranced by this book. I haven't followed Patti Smith's career, although now I don't know why. I grew up in the age of Bob Dylan, The Doors, Allen Ginsberg, Warhol, and all the other luminaries from the world of rock, poetry, and art that Smith has known and associated with. (Who *hasn't* she known in the arts of that period?)   I saw a Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition once that shocked me, but also left me with the impression that this was a true artist, however controversial his material; that he was interesting in a way I couldn't then understand.  Smith's book seems written for people like me: she was Mapplethorpe's devoted friend and lover during their formative years as literally starving artists in New York, loyal and devoted to each other, supportive and protective. Smith had promised herself she would tell Robert's story, and so she has; and now I get what he was in a way that would not otherwise have been possible for me. The love story is painful in its intensity and innocence and ultimate loss.  Her language is simple and straightforward, frank but delicate. I loved reading her descriptions of her and Robert's artist spaces and their talismans and found objects imbued with meaning. Her words gave me a renewed appreciation for the essence of things: not things as material wealth but as objects that contain meaning and value. She and Mapplethorpe were drawn to odd, castoff objects and they combed second hand stores, used bookstores, and dime stores for the treasures they made into art. But they had great respect for quality, and purchased the finest art materials when possible. Their creations were not limited to collages; they made necklaces, bracelets, special picture frames for Robert's photographs; shrines, and their own costumes. The descriptions of their creative clothing give new insight into why artists look the way they do.  In spite of their avant garde boldness, they were a sentimental couple, riding the subway to Coney Island, sharing hotdogs when, as often, they lacked the money for more than one. They took turns supporting each other; they encouraged each other's art and for many years shared loft space and friends. Even when Robert realized he was gay and had male lovers, the two remained close; Smith, who was not gay (and did not use drugs) eventually had lovers of her own, but she and Mapplethorpe remained as close as two people can for most of their adult lives until his early death from AIDS.  Although we know the tragic outcome from the beginning, this is a sweet tale of love and discovery and growing up as an artist in a fascinating time and place.  The book contains many clearly-rendered photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and others that show the couple separately and together, and some of their weird and lovely creations. It's a treasure.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|Many original Trekies don't like this movie but I did. I saw every TV episode and all of the Star Trek movies. This was by far and above the best of the movies. Special effects were great. I've seen it both in DVD and Blu-ray formats. It deserves Blu-ray.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|This was a very good sci-fi type season 1 series of shows.  Very thought provoking and \\"out of the box\\".  So many tend to be very typical with easy to guess plots.  This series can really catch you off guard many times.<br /><br />The character development was slow at first and really took several episodes before you started connecting to them.  I especially liked the character of the Mr. Bishop senior as he's aged and his sense of humor was dry and again caught a person off guard.  I liked how he seemed to soften in his humanity as the season wore on.<br /><br />Can't wait for season 2!  So, if you like out of the ordinary, sci fi with plot and good characters, this is one you'd like to try.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I was reading reviews of this movie and wasn't sure if I'd ever seen it when I was a child.  I think I may have at least once (on cable?), because some of the scenes sounded familiar to me.  I've always liked the MGM Wizard of Oz movie, but I've never read the Oz books, so many of the characters in this movie were unfamiliar to me.  I wasn't sure what to expect or what I'd think of it, and I actually liked it more than I thought I would.<br /><br />It is definitely a sequel to the first film--the title alone says it.  Dorothy is returning to Oz, only to find that it is not what she-or the audience of the first movie-remembers.  Spoilers ahead, so don't keep reading if you don't want to know some of the story.  Only 6 months have passed from when Dorothy returned to Kansas, but a LOT has changed in Oz.  The Emerald City is broken and deserted, except for some residents that have turned into statues-including her friends the Lion and the Tin Man, who look different than we remember, but we get the idea so it doesn't really matter.  New characters-mostly villains-are brought in.  The people at the mental hospital who Dorothy escapes from with the help of someone.  The Wheelers, Princess Mombi, and the Nome King are all trying to stop Dorothy from saving the Emerald City.  Somehow her chicken from the farm is with her, and can now speak.  She meets some new friends too-Tik Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, Ozma, and the Gump.<br /><br />I can see how the movie did not do well.  People were expecting certain things from the MGM film we all know so well.  I don't mind seeing the new characters.  I just had to get used to Dorothy looking younger/smaller in the beginning and then I didn't give it another thought.  The only thing I would have liked to see included in this one is Glinda.  I thought it was her as the prisoner in Mombi's castle-for a brief moment it looks like Glinda's crown and dress.  I wonder if the filmmakers did this intentionally so we would think it was Glinda at first.  She was a very important part of the first movie, as were the Munchkins, and you can't help wondering while watching this one-what happened to them?  It is naturally the first thing you think about when you see Dorothy first discover her old house and the broken yellow brick road.  But it doesn't really detract from the movie while you are watching it because there is so much going on to keep you interested.  But afterward, you can't help thinking about it again.  I have not read the books yet so I don't know how this all plays out in the stories.  But given that the first movie is so famous and how important Glinda was as a character, it would have been nice to see her.  I'm glad they brought the ruby slippers back for an interesting appearance-and of course the Scarecrow.  As others have mentioned, he only has a few lines, and he, Tin Man, and the Lion are not shown very much.  I don't mind that they have small roles in this.  The movie is very different and it doesn't really matter as long as they ARE there at some point.  To omit Glinda is weird.  I'll have to watch it again, perhaps I missed a mention of her.<br /><br />But the movie is good anyway.  I liked seeing Fairuza Balk as Dorothy.  She starred in a staple of my childhood, The Worst Witch.  Both movies fit in with 80s favorites like Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, The Goonies, and Neverending Story.  There is also a dvd bonus interview with Fairuza as an adult.  I was hoping she'd mention TWW, but she didn't.  It's interesting though.  There are a few scenes in the film that may scare very young children, it's a bit creepy but I didn't find it to be as bad as some people do.<br /><br />I watched the movie with my mother who also grew up with the MGM film of course.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I was recently introduced to this game by a friend and became completely hooked after my first play through.  In general, I like playing board games.  I am the kind of person who will go out of their way to have an evening of Monopoly (if you're not cheating, you're not trying).  I was a little worried this game would be too much like Risk.  I typically tend to shy away from games like Risk simply because they take too long and far too much of the game relies on luck of the dice which I find to be frustrating.<br /><br />Not so with Settlers.  While there is an element of random luck, there is a definite sense of strategy.  The rules are simple enough in that it takes about one play through and even the most casual of gamers will be able to start mulling over their plan of attack next time they play.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the notion of an expansion pack for a board game.  I also enjoy strategy computer games, and in a day and age when good strategy computer games are becoming harder and harder to find, I found the expansion pack feature to be rather exciting.  I appreciate the fact that Settlers allows room for adjustment so that you could literally play just this base game hundreds of times and never the same way twice.<br /><br />All in all, this game is an excellent buy.  I have been playing it rather consistently for several months now and still enjoy it each time.  I have also invested in the Cities & Knights and Seafarers expansions which I have found to be just as high quality as the original game.
0385532458|1.0|Grisham has been a long-time favorite author but this one confirms he should stop writing. Recent books have had weak endings but this one reaches a new low. The stories are generally depressing and sad and lack the twists that mark good short story writing.

B001UV4XUG|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I expected with the out of order sequence of scenes.  Joseph Gordon Levitt was good for the first time in a decade and Zooey Deschanel was phenomenal as always.  What makes her performances great is her uniqueness, the fact that nothing she says or does is what one would expect.  The ending could have been fleshed out a bit more, but overall it was good.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I understand why some critics didn't like the movie - but I still loved it!  I want to watch it again and again - and soon - but I will NOT buy this featureless release.  Please people!  Vote with your dollar.  Just like Lord of the Rings, tell the studios that you demand a quality release with bonus features.  You want a digital version you can play on your computer or other portable device.  You want at least the option to see the extended scenes.  Tell them you demand ALL of these features OR you will take your money elsewhere!  If all they are going to offer you is little better than the pirated version you can buy on any street corner or download from the net, well...
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Being that I'm a fan of science fiction and war dramas I have to admit that this was already my kind of movie before I ever even saw it. My love for campy, over the top or gritty realism films of all kinds aside, I found myself extremely skeptical of this one going in.  There was a lot of hype about Avatar before it's release and having been nothing short of violated by George Lucas' pointless and ill-conceived return to the Skywalker Legacy, I was strongly leaning towards the world of Pandora as being another special effects laden dud meant to distract my eyes away from rigid actors and invisible plots.  In short though, to me, James Cameron has always had vision and patience, the core elements that truly make for a unique and lasting movie going experience.  The only other modern day director I give credit to in this area is Peter Jackson for his masterpiece Lord of the Rings trilogy.    I was not let down.  Not in any way whatsoever by Avatar.  For the first time, I was watching a film enhanced with seamless CGI that actually helped build on the plot and character development, rather than try to cover a horrid line like \\"I wish I could just wish away my feelings\\" with floating fruit and beeping robots that could have saved themselves all sorts of trouble if they had used those spiffy built in jets later on in life. (Think R2-D2's first arrival on Dagobah).  I was immediately astounded by the world of Pandora and it genuinely feels like you're landing there with Jake for the first time and taking it all in.        Cameron's rendition of the military, or if I was following the story right, a powerful mercenary team with access to military equipment is awesome.  The scorpion airships look sharp and tough and actually lend to the eye, the imagery and behavior of a real scorpion.  Nicely done but there's waaaay more to Pandora than just what the humans have brought.      This world is a snapshot of Cameron's imagination.  Everything around you is unique but still maintains a feel of familiarity.  Which is exactly what's happening to Jake, the film's hero.  He is embedded into a returning peace envoy of scientists as part of a covert ops mission to find the Navi's weakness because they happen to be sitting on the biggest deposit of unobtanium within 200 clicks and the natives refuse to move.  Jake manages to be accepted into the clan because of a sign from one of the symbiotic lifeforms on Pandora and it is from here that most of the character development takes place.  I fell in love with Neytiri too and thus became intrinsically linked to Jake's dilemma.  He finds that he was meant to come to Pandora for an altogether different reason.  One nobody, not even the viewer of this film could possibly imagine.  Although the basic premise of this story has been done before, it is still used here efficiently and the acting is strong enough to remind us that there is a reason why we're seeing every single thing we're seeing.    It does not matter if you're not a sci fi fan or you don't care for the hyped up special effects laden garbage they've been hailing as blockbusters for the last few years (and they wonder why the theater business is in the toilet).  Avatar is THE film that has set the new standard and single handedly did its own part in upholding a sluggish global economy with a current worldwide gross approaching 3 Billion dollars, dethroning Titanic as the top grossing film of all time.  It's the kind of film we've always wanted to see done with CGI and the idea of using real world jungle settings in the principal photography and THEN overlaying the CGI, now that's just plain brilliant.  Cameron has taken Peter Jackson's technique for body acting CGI on Gollum's character and run with it to create the Navi and probably some other indigenous lifeforms as well but, I couldn't tell and you will not be able to tell where reality ends and the CGI begins when you see this film.  It's flawless and breathtaking.  The Hallelujah Mountains are of particular note and they are aptly named because if I saw something like that for real, I would say the exact same thing.      Please see this film, hopefully in IMAX 3D if you're lucky.  The 3D used doesn't hurt your head and make you nauseous like every 3D movie before it.  I believe Cameron developed new 3D cameras for this film?  I could be wrong about that but, Avatar should definitely be seen on the big screen in some format in order to truly appreciate it's scope.  You will not be disappointed.    Thank you James Cameron for giving us tired, financially strapped movie lovers something worth believing in again!
0470450266|5.0|Simply one of the best anatomy book for a ZBrush or character artist. As a character artist at Crytek Hungary I found this book essential to my daily job, and spare time projects. The language is very readable, Scott teaches the anatomy as a friend would teach you. It is the first book when I was explained how to learn the muscle and bone names, what is their meaning, and how to understand when you read a new one.    Great book, I suggest it to anyone from entry level to professional artists as well
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Heard \\"Need You Now\\" during the CMA awards show and had to have the album, which wasn't yet out, so I ordered it to be delivered when it came out.  I have it in my car CD player and play it over and over again every time I go anywhere. The other songs are also good, but that's my favorite. And the price from Amazon was the lowest I've seen anywhere!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|First, this is one of the first non-fiction books I've read in years - I'm a mystery/thriller fan.  That said, I have no idea why I picked up this book.  Wow, what a great random choice!  I made myself ration my reading time - I enjoyed the book so much.<br /><br />Barbara Demick weaves together the stories (based on interviews) of a very diverse group of North Koreans in a way that gives readers a picture of the population as a whole.  This isn't a history book or social argument.  It's a collection of stories based on interviews with real people about how they survived real - and tragic - events.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the information presented at the end of the book.  I'm sure few of us consider how the inevitable demise of North Korea will effect South Korea's economy and population in general.  That country's strategic planning and research will be invaluable as they attempt to both help their neighbors and control the potential damage to their economy, infrastructure and culture.
B002U6CJCE|4.0|Ten years after \\"Universal Soldier: The Return\\" flopped at the box office, and some say killed the franchise, the series returns with \\"Universal Soldier: Regeneration\\". Featuring a better story, even harder hitting action sequences, and both Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren reprising their roles from the original, will this newest installment wash away the bad memories left behind by its predecessor?    \\"Universal Soldier: Regeneration\\" begins when terrorists take control of one of Chernobyl's leftover nuclear reactors, threatening to unleash massive devastation unless their demands are met. Not wishing to negotiate with terrorists, the government sends in a military strike force; however, the terrorists have a nasty surprise up their sleeve... the next generation of UniSol (UFC Fighter Andrei \\"The Pit Bull\\" Arlovski). As their strike force is torn apart, the only alternative the government has left is to reactivate one of the original UniSol's, Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme).    If you're like me, when you saw that another entry into this franchise was being released you probably had these thoughts or something similar, \\"What? Someone's made another Universal Soldier movie? The last one was horrible. Why would someone go back for more?\\" Well, that someone happens to be up-and-coming director John Hyams (son of famed director Peter Hyams), and the end result is actually much better than expected.    Written by first-time screenwriter Victor Ostrovsky, this newest installment opts to completely ignore the events of \\"Universal Soldier: The Return\\", along with the two Made-for-TV movies, and serve as a direct sequel to the original film. The story is very tight, fast-paced, and filled with high-energy action sequences to thrill fans of the original. The previous film made the unwise decision to squeeze in as many comedic moments and cheesy one-liners (none of which were humorous) to break up the non-stop violence, while inadvertently causing the audienceto wince in pain at the cinematic abomination on display. In contrast, this film chooses to inject a simple, yet decently crafted dramatic story; which works very well for this type of film, I might add.    One part of the story is focused on the terrorists (although this portion is generic and by-the-book), while the second part centers on Luc Deveraux's attempt at returning to a normal life, despite his still prevalent killer instinct. It is in these moments regarding Luc's \\"de-programming\\" that the movie really begins to rise above being just another stock action title. Of course these quieter, more dramatic scenes within the movie were only made possible by the surprising performance delivered by fading action star Jean-Claude Van Damme.    In the original film, Van Damme showed some slight emotional range; however, all of his acting range was all but omitted from the sequel and most of his other action movies as well. For this film, Jean-Claude once again finds the emotional core of the character, offering a more contemplative hero who desperately wants to take control of what's left of his life. His performance here is proof that with the proper material and direction, Van Damme could still be an effective action star despite his age. For those of you that may scoff at this observation, I give you Sylvester Stallone (\\"Rambo\\") or Bruce Willis (\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\") as examples of how aging action stars can still make their most recognizable characters relevant in the modern day.    Alongside Jean-Claude is former UFC Heavyweight Champion Andrei \\"The Pit Bull\\" Arlovski as the next generation of UniSol or NGU as he is referred to in the movie. Andrei isn't the most eloquent of speakers with the English language, but thankfully, the script doesn't call on him to give much more than one or two word statements. Of course, his acting chops (what little he may possess) weren't the reason for his casting in the role. Obviously, with his background in the UFC, it's not difficult to determine why Andrei got the role of the primary villain in the film. His fighting prowess, not to mention the director has done a couple of documentaries surrounding the world of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fighting, made him an ideal candidate to inject new blood into the dying franchise.    On a related note, the fight scenes are extremely hard-hitting and brutal, thanks in no small part to Andrei Arlovski's UFC roots. The more up close and personal style of fighting is a departure from the flashier style with lots of cool moves, kicks and flips that most of Van Damme's movies typically employ. The downside is that initially the fights appear to run together because Arlovski's character of NGU seemed to dispatch his opponents the exact same way. Luckily, after the opening fight sequences the remainder became much more varied and exciting; otherwise, boredom would have set in as quickly as it had done for its predecessor.    Rounding out the headliners for the movie is actor Dolph Lundgren, who reprises his role as Andrew Scott from the original film. Sadly, Dolph's appearance in this movie is all too brief, and occurs very late in the story. I presumed with his character being shown on the cover that Dolph would play a major part in the film. In truth, his role is nothing more than an overly long cameo appearance to assist in tying this film directly to the first one. While his character of Andrew Scott was more unhinged and homicidal in the original film, this iteration is a much more subdued individual. Although, there is a hint that the maniac still lurks beneath the surface, just waiting for a chance to be unleashed. Thus, providing some added tension to his time onscreen opposite Jean-Claude, making those scenes even more entertaining.    The rest of the cast of characters are fairly forgettable, and amount to nothing more than typical action movie fare. The terrorists for the most part are bland and generic, as is the military forces brought into stop them. Of course, even if this weren't a Direct-to-DVD sequel, one wouldn't expect much more from a theatrically released action film either. After all, the main reason you watch these movies is to see the UniSol's in action, typically fighting each other, and anything else is irrelevant.    Overall, \\"Universal Soldier: Regeneration\\" is a satisfying sequel that blows its theatrical predecessor out of the water (a rare feat for a Direct-to-DVD follow-up). While not quite as good as the original film, the movie does stand up well on its own though. The story moves along at a brisk pace, without getting tangled up in plot holes or inconsistencies. The action is much more visceral than any of the previous entries, and of course, it's fun to have the two stars of the original film back to reprise their roles at least one more time.    \\"Universal Soldier: Regeneration\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B0000033TE|5.0|I  recently had the misfortune of buying the SHOUT remaster of this recently...How disappointing...But I just redeemed my soul by scoring a near mint copy of the RHINO/WEA version and what a MAJOR difference..RHINO comes thru again...<br /><br />The liner notes and pics are very informative and very cool.....but the remastering is simply amazing...exactly like the original LP..only better....nice and full...not muddy....every track is consistent in  mix and output (unlike the SHOUT version).

B002VPE1AW|1.0|Don't assume this film has a normal and 3D version like every other 3D film out there. Why no 3D? Because this is a joke. The punchline assumes that people who own Blu-ray players have money to burn and will dive on any plastic case with a blue strip at the top. Oh no no no we won't! It has me seeing red!<br /><br />UPDATE: After one person called me dumb (apparently the news media has taught us that civil behavior just isn't as cool as attempting to elevating ourselves and our opinions by calling other people names) and another said he had no idea where I was coming from, I decided to update this review with part of my answer to each.<br /><br />This movie didn't wow the children in my life because it had a great story they'd never heard before and super production values. They begged to see this and Alice in Wonderland because they were in 3D. Unless they make a version of this that you can view on a normal set with glasses, I won't buy it and recommend that parents ask their children if a great picture will make up for not having 3D before they purchase it.<br /><br />I saw from the previews that there is a whole wave of these films coming out, including a remake of Tron. While I'm sure that will make for good box office attendance, it will not make my niece want a take home version without the bells and whistles, nor goad me into buying technology that will be upgraded to something else in 6 months (that is my definition of dumb). Sorry but I won't buy a \\"version\\" of what I want because they are using the \\"real thing\\" as a come-on for new technology. They've lost my 3D DVD dollar completely.<br /><br />That is why I have no reason to buy this or any other version of a 3D movie not in an affordable version of 3D that can be viewed by the children in my life on my year old 50\\" flat screen. If I had bought it, I would be listening to disappointed children all day. Now that would be really dumb!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|In my opinion, this movie franchise set the standard for sci-fi and action movies. The concept is acceptable, the acting is tight, the direction is spot on and the technical production values exceed expectations of this film's genre.
0452286751|5.0|It's simultaneously subtle and obvious.  The first clew comes when the protagonist, Howard Roark, is booted out of architecture school for having ideas that are 'too original,' although all his professors admit that his ideas are quite brilliant.<br /><br />'Wait a minute,' the reader thinks, 'that's not realistic.  Professors in the liberal arts are desperate for students with original thoughts, practically begging them not to echo back the same tired ideas that they hear year after year after year.'<br /><br />Finally it hits; the reader realises that this is EXACTLY the description that persons of certain personality types would say if they had failed out of school, especially if they had a few good ideas that their professors liked, but kept interrupting class repeating them as a mantra and furthermore refusing to study any of the material that they are actually meant to be learning (which the narrator practically confesses to the main character doing).  Perhaps there is some merit to Roark's ideas, but that doesn't mean he should lack a background in neo-classical, or any other style of architecture (and personally I despise the style he's clearly promoting, which is seen readily in all those horrible spiritless poured concrete buildings that Americans were erecting in the 1960s).<br /><br />So here is the secret to understanding this book: It's written entirely in a sort of third-person unreliable narrator.  The character of the narrator is Howard Roark, and the Howard Roark described is a sort of trippy idealised version of himself.  Think of it as a sort of grotesque caricature of the conservative economic and social ideals emerging in the US at the time of the writing where we learn about what the narrator holds dear and his distorted picture of the world through the distorted retelling of the events that befell him.  It's the goal of the reader to read between the lines and try to figure out what actually happened, that the narrator is reinventing to cast himself as the hero (imagine Theodore Bulpington of H G Wells' The Bulpington of Blup).  For example, it's cleverly glossed over that Roark is practising architecture without a license, or passing any of the various certification exams required to show fitness in producing habitable buildings, but instead foils some backwater rube into allowing him to design a 'revolutionary gas station' or something, which probably by blind luck doesn't collapse or burst into flames.  As the story continues (and forgive me if I get details wrong, it's been two years since I read this book) he starts submitting plans for some housing development to an old schoolmate Peter Keating (possibly unsolicited) who he describes as being rather devoid of creativity and originality.  The buildings turn out looking quite different from how Roark designed them, and at some point he's challenging the allegedly spineless Keating (possibly reinventing himself stalking Keating, noticing some resemblance between a project Keating is working on and some schizophrenic scrawl he had posted to Keating's office unsolicited) and instead of just removing his name from a project that he was never officially connected with, blows the things up.  He's captured, makes some ridiculous (but obviously quite meaningful to both Roark the narrator and Roark the reinvention of the narrator's self) rant about the value of ego(!) and is heroically set free.  It's pretty safe to guess at this point that this is what the narrator wished had happened, but that he is probably writing his life story from behind bars.<br /><br />Other character emerge as the story progresses, including Ellsworth Toohey (an incarnation of the conservative view of the progressive movement) and Dominique Francon (a terribly board rich girl who gets her kicks breaking things, picking out random quarry workers (in this case Roark), imagining them as the men of her dreams, getting herself raped(?) and falling in love with them even more).  The implication with Dominique is that Roark the storyteller is reinventing some incident in his past where he became sexually attracted to some young woman, imagined her as troubled and he her saviour, and subsequently raped her when she didn't respond to him as he hoped that she would.  Think of the Jeanny songs by Falco (available on youtube for your viewing pleasure).<br /><br />There are other characters (all strangely on the same page with their thoughts), and one could do quite a sophisticated analysis of how these characters reflect an emerging conservative world view at the time or writing, and parody them to illustrate it's fundamental absurdity.  Amazon reviews, however, aren't the place, and I haven't the time nor the desire, but if you want to read a rather chilling tale told from the point of view of a psychopathic rapist/terrorist and is at the same time a parody of the ultra-right-wing movement then I strongly recommend Fountainhead.  This is a book that will stay with you for a long time.ication with Dominique is that Roark the storyteller is reinventing some incident in his past where he became sexually attracted to some young woman, imagined her as troubled and he her saviour, and subsequently raped her when she didn't respond to him as he hoped that she would.

0393072231|4.0|The story that Michael Lewis tells is riveting, but that's helped greatly by knowing how the story ends.  Where I feel that he fails is in explaining clearly the nature of the transactions taking place, nor does he spend much time at the end describing in detail the mechanism of self destruction of the large institutions involved in the debacle.  Some diagrams would have really helped.    On a side note, the one star reviews seem to be complaining about the lack of a Kindle edition or the fact that the author defended derivatives in times gone by.  Those issues are irrelevant to the worth of this book and it provides poor information to prospective purchasers.
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|This is such an awesome cd. To me, the music of ELO is timeless. This album marks the true talent of the group.

B002VECMAE|4.0|This movie, based on the book by [[ASIN:1439181772 Jon Ronson]], digs deep into the past to pull out some rather strange and unusual aspects of American covert activities, many of which were true, such as the use of [[ASIN:0312964137 Psychic Warriors]] and the [[ASIN:1449524559 First Earth Battalion Operations Manual]].  The story revolves around a \\"New Earth Army\\" that was formed back in the 70s as a means of avoiding wars moreso than engaging in them, bringing to mind the old \\"psi-ops\\" and rogue warriors like [[ASIN:1574881760 Edward Lansdale]].  Bill Django is the guru of this unconventional battalion, with Jeff Bridges pretty much reprising his role as \\"The Dude\\" in [[ASIN:B000A7DVR2 The Big Lebowski]].  Lyn (Clooney) has a vision of his former leader and finds himself headed to Iraq to locate him.  Along the way he meets Bob (McGregor) anxious to get a story out of Iraq after breaking up with his wife (Rebecca Mader in a cameo role).  The movie seems to follow a most circuitous path with the story of the New Earth Army told in retrospect, as Lyn and Bob fight off a band of insurgents and some private contractors en route to a secret base in Iraq headed by a former nemesis Larry Hooper (Spacey).<br /><br />For some this may be too much fun and games, but for others it should provide a refreshing change of pace from the current staple of Iraq war movies.  After setting up a fantastic story, the movie seems to rush to a conclusion, but I think those who like this kind of intrigue will really enjoy this movie.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|Sure do miss the originals.  This starts out with loud noise, too much action and general overall chaos.  By the time all this was over I was asking myself - and when do we get to the plot.    Not of the quality or character of the original.  We didn't like it much.

And that's a big clue as to what it knows about itself. It will not appeal to people who are looking for a feel-good comedy. You have to be prepared for \\"depressing\\". Nothing wrong with that, but I hate misleading packaging. At least it's nowhere near as dishonest as the packaging for \\"World's Greatest Dad.\\"<br /><br />Sorry to rain on parades, but I thought fair warning is needed, after seeing all those glowing reviews. It's an OK movie, and you'll probably enjoy it (as much as such things can be enjoyed).
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan is truly exceptional.  I thoroughly enjoyed the CD.  She is especially impressive singing religious music.  I was simply carried away.  The only criticism (reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the background music could have been softer to match her quality and style - also, the renditions of Daydream Believer,Cry Me a River, and End of the World could have been at a little faster tempo.  But this takes nothing away from her talent and gorgeous voice - again, its more the fault of the producer and musical director that he didn't maximize her talent to the absolute best it could be.  Looking forward to more of her albums!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|The first time I caught an episode on our PBS station, I was instantly spellbound by the beauty of the cinematography!

I have not read the books, nor have I seen all of the episodes...yet!
B0007PAMR4|1.0|I give my sympathies to the Herbert family and to the fans of Frank and Brian Herbert's storytelling.  I was finished reading the first three magnificent books when I saw the movie and accepted it because of my appreciation for Herbert's writing. After reading the Legends of Dune and the Dune: House Trilogy books by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson and re-reading Frank's book Dune, I am perplexed and agitated by the lack of cohesion and harmony between the movie and the books.  First time movie goers had to assume that Duke Leto's staff was well respected and knowledgeable. They had no back story. How does one explain how goofy they looked and acted?  Jessica, raised and trained as a Bene Gesserit (BG), is portrayed as weak. In the book \\"Dune\\" she has winning confrontational conversations with the duke's staff members that earned her respect.  Because the screenplay offered no back story or explanation of the BG, they ALL came across as ghoulish, floating heads. The Reverend Mother Mohiam actually barked and growled and she was SEARCHING FOR HUMANS!  The Fremen are not wearing cloaks or hoods in the middle of the blazing heat of the desert with black stillsuits. They are supposed to be survivors of the harsh climate and acclimated to the desert and mysteriously done in the movie as Caucasians with no sunscreen. Did the producers fear the portrayal of the heroes as Arab-like?  The Guild Navigators (not the Holtzman Engines) were shown to fold space.  I think we know which actor is the Shadout Mapes. I'm surprised she didn't recite \\"I am the Shadout Mapes\\" for her death scene.  The self-talk narration just made obvious observations making the actors sound a little crazy.  Those wishing to be entertained by a story which is complex and enlightening written by a great author (and son) should read the books. This is a story that influenced the creation of the STAR WARS, BATTLESTAR GALLACTICA, and other storyline ideas. READ THE BOOKS, ALL OF THEM!  READ THE BOOKS!
B0026NZR98|4.0|This is one I was goaded into seeing by someone shortly after it was released on DVD and I watched strictly for humoring them. I was pleasantly surprised and occasionally get the urge to watch it again about once a year or so. I make no comments whatsoever on which release is what or HD, different versions and tech specs. I speak strictly of the movie itself.    It was well done and very haunting with the psychology of loneliness and isolation. The silence and lack of soundtrack through most of the movie drives it home, though when you watch it for the first time, you usually can't put your finger on it. We're so trained to hear music scores and laugh tracks and they are effecting the feel of the story without us ever knowing it. Its almost subliminal. When you remove it, you can't help but know something is off and have a guttural reaction to the intense silence - something most of us rarely hear these days.     Considering how many times this movie has been spoofed with the line \\"Wilson!\\" You almost have to watch just for popularity purposes, but the reason it's popular is its so damn good. Hanks' character is so palpable and real, you feel his frustration, fear and sadness. To imagine being so close, yet so far and knowing for so long that everyone you ever loved is moving on without you. And how such a intelligent, grounded person is driven to making an imaginary friend out of a volleyball to keep his sanity.     Bottom line, its well done, well acted and a great story about resilience and loneliness and moving on. Definite must see, even if you only watch it once.
B00081U7HC|4.0|What can I say...It's a great movie.  Julia Roberts and Richard Gere have a wonderful on-screen chemistry and the cast is fantastic. It's \\"Cinderella\\" with a twist!  I can watch it time and time again.

I own seasons 1-4 and I can honestly say that Season 4 is by far the most compelling, and overall best season of the series. The beauty about this show is that each season get's better and better. The actor's are incredible and the chemistry between them is palpable. This is such a great show its like watching a mini movie. If you have not seen the first 3 season's do yourself a favor and purchase them before you watch season 4 and then watch season 4 it will blow your mind! Love, love, love it!

B001OQCV2E|1.0|This review contains no real spoilers but let me basically sum it up for you. This is just simply an absolute waste of movie film, digital film, or whatever the heck they are using these days to make cheesy flicks like this. Albeit, the special effects were decent but nothing you havn't already seen many times over in your typical disaster movie. On the other hand the acting was like something out of a 70's B movie, the plot was...wait a minute...there was no plot,and the storyline in general was nothing short of complete predictability. As if the non stop narrow death misses of the main characters were unbelievable enough the writer of this train wreck  apparently thought it amusing to have several moments of humorous quips from the characters while the world was falling down around them. Adding further suspension of disbelief, people in this film stop and talk about stupid personal issues during the most ridiculous moments as buildings are toppling all around them and the earth is virtually crumbling under their feet. By the way, did I mention that none of these characters are interesting or likable except for maybe Woody Harrelson as the amusing nut job conspiracy theorist. Poor ol Woody must have really needed the paycheck because this film will end up going down as one of the worst made on his resume. During the film  all I could do was wish and hope for everyone to DIE and die quickly to put me out of my misery from this maelstrom of over dramatic non-sense. Lastly, of course it's the MADE IN CHINA ship that provides the true safe haven for humanity. Gee, don't see any political double meaning with that? Guess we should all keep shopping at Wal-Mart because we are actually funding our future for survival of the human race.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|If you are in love with the original Phantom of the Opera score, you will love this one too.  Rating the original Phantom as my \\"favorite\\" show, I found this sequel to be quite compelling.  Needless to say, I have not seen the show as yet, but the music lyrics will give you a hint of what's to come.  The music is wonderful -- although there are a few songs that seem out of place -- but all in all this is a wonderful CD.
1416562591|4.0|This is a cleverly written, attention-getting, interesting, entertaining book. It's a page-turner, but it's different, not your usual drama, but it's dramatic. I can't tell what about it won it the Man Booker Prize, but it's prize-worthy. But I'm not sure about it. I think it takes a bit of sophistication and a seasoned reader to enjoy/appreciate this book. It's not easy to explain why I liked it. It's odd!
B001HN694K|5.0|One of the best Johnny Depp movies besides  the pirate ones that i have seen  really a great movie...a must see
B002UNMWAG|2.0|Just watched the movie; was a big fan of Saints I. It pains me to say that while it's watchable, it's ultimately cartoonish and overdone. The brothers' relationship is taken for granted, and they are moved through obligatory gunplay like pieces on a board. The humor between them and their Mexican sidekick is phony and overdone, and his character is never clear. And Peter Fonda's accent sucks. He obviously didn't take much time preparing for his role, as limited as it was. Don't get me wrong -- the movie wasn't terrible, but it could -- and should -- have been so much better. I watch the original every so often. I don't think I'll watch this one again.

B0034JKZ86|5.0|Music has always been a part of Walt Disney cartoons, going way back to Steamboat Mickey in 1928! But Disney never seemed to acknowledge jazz until now. The studio's newest feature film, The Princess and the Frog, has New Orleans jazz all over it! From the jazz based score by Randy Newman, and a jazz-talking alligator named Louis (who has the unmistakable voice of that cat named Satchmo) who plays \\"Dippermouth Blues\\" and a tribute to Sidney Bechet, this is one truly delightful film. The story takes place in the 1920s French Quarter and features the high quality hand drawn animation Disney is famous for. For the zydeco and cajun music fan there's a bit of that too, courtesy of Terrance Simien. Dr. John also gets a song and he's on the soundtrack CD too! Okay, there's the pop vocal love song by Ne-Yo to attract the teens, but there's plenty of other great music and a fun story line for adults. This may be my favorite Disney movie in years!  Highly recommended for anyone from 8 to 80! Check out the companion Soundtrack on CD too!<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />Anything Phonographic

B001QWBM62|5.0|I have used the H4n for over a year now, average 9 hours of recording a week, small and large venues, using the built in mics and direct inputs off a soundboard.  I love using this recorder, every detail but one is great.  The other  reviews are accurate.  This won't handle a normal line level.  I use a small mixer in between the H4n and my front of house mixer signal just to step the signal down.  I have had to go to extremes to step the signal down in other situations, like taking the signal off a mixer and running it through an old boom box with an aux in, and back out the head phone jack of the boombox then into the Zoom.  You can use anything to step it down, but what an unreasonable pain.  What were they thinking?  I have been in several situations where I didn't have anything to step the signal down, and lost the recording opportunity.    That being said, is it worth buying the Zoom H4n?  Without a doubt, YES!  I recorded a piano concert the other night, I placed the H4n inside the piano with a boom stand about a foot off the stings, back a foot and a half from the hammers, and set my mic levels.  Once the recording was complete I shared it with a university level music instructor.  He was amazed by the quality of the recording.  I have a friend who has been a top notch, professional, big name recording engineer in the past, he is also an amazing piano player.  He listened to the recording I got off that piano.  His jaw was dropped the whole time.  He said it was good enough to master, studio quality easily.  He picked up on the noise floor which is present... because it wasn't done in a studio... it was taken in a small chapel with maybe 30 uncouth participants who were making plenty of noise and driving me nuts.  Sometimes we take things too seriously, huh?  or maybe they just didn't know that I was tracking an amazing performance that would be worth putting on a CD... except for their talking, rustling, opening and closing doors... it all shows up on the recording... along with every detail of every note played on that piano, all in full stereo with great separation, complete left to right panned pick up of the full scale of the piano... everything is crystal clear and perfectly accurate.  The recording encompasses you and captivates you.  The stereo field of this recorder is breathtaking.    I have recorded full sets with drums, bass, keyboard, guitar, electric guitar and vocals with effects, everything I do is Christian, these sets were jazz and rock genre... in a sound insulated room... and the musicians agree everything sounds like it was picked up in a studio.  Every detail of the drums is present, the attack, the presence, the resonance of each hit.  Same with the other instruments and voices, you can hear every detail of every instrument and voice in the set.  The sound in the room was well balanced and aligned and the musicians were great, the noise floor was very low, so it all came together with this recorder and now I have some sweet tracks.  Not bad for the investment in the H4n.    As far as the signal quality of the built in mics on the H4n is concerned, I have never detected even a trace of self noise from the mics, and they pick up the full frequency range completely.  I have recorded at concert level volumes with plenty of headroom left before risk of clipping.  Unlike the line level adjustments, the mic level adjustments are very adequate.    Recordings in small venues don't sound perfectly clear because of the noise floor. In large venues they are even worse. Don't blame the recorder for less than perfect live recordings... it's the background noise that kills the recording quality. Like I say I have recorded with the H4n in sound insulated (studio) environments... and the recorder is perfect!  If your environment is clean from noise your recordings will be as clear and perfect as you could ever dream... the recorder picks up every high, and every low, and everything in between perfectly, accurately, through it's built in mics.      If you step your line level signals down, it records perfectly directly.  The remote is handy for setting your levels as it indicates with LEDs when you are within 6db of clipping.  Don't trust the LCD display levels, they can show the signal is within range but your button lights are flashing because your hardware is clipping.  Go by the button lights or the remote LEDs; if they aren't blinking red, then set your levels by the LCD.  Most of my recordings are off a little mixer with an adjustable output for the tape out, so line level is not a problem in my most frequent application.    I have a few bits of advice.  My rep at Sweetwater talked me into a set of Beyerdynamics DT770 pro headphones.  They are terribly expensive; I argued that I have a set of Sennheiser HD280's and thought they were unbeatable.  I didn't realize they were missing everything under 70Hz.  Until you listen to recordings through a real pair of studio-grade headphones you don't realize what is really available in a recording for your ears to hear and what you have been missing without them.  The Beyerdynamics bring that much out of your music. I would recommend them to anyone who is taking the time to create or record music; invest in a good set of cans.      Next I would recommend my favorite sound editing software, Audacity.  It is FREE.  It is worth the learning curve.  It is fast in it's performance.  It is perfect for the tracks and mixes you will be picking up with the H4n.  You need good editing software to get the most of your recording experience. Audacity is great for chopping up your recordings into separate songs, making them ready instantly to put on a CD. It is great for mixing the tracks you pick up with the mics and at the same time with your direct inputs. The  EQ in this program is amazing once you get used to drawing curves, you can EQ extremely precise... if you can hear the details in your recordings... (thus the recommendation for thegood headphones).  When first learning to use this program print out the help files on selecting your audio ranges for editing... and practice on a track.  Once you are used to it you will love it.  I spend at least 20 hours a week using this software.    I have used Free Audio Editor a lot, too.  It has the most intuitive interface but it is slow; editing with it takes a lot of time.  Also, it is not free for their full feature version.  I have used WavePad a bit, you might try it, the free version is pretty complete. The parameters of the EQ in Audacity are superior, though the real time interface of WavePad effects is priceless.  I really like the compressor and its interface in WavePad.  I have Cubase AI4 and can't even grasp the learning curve for it, it is way over my head without serious time to devote to figuring it out; plus it is not even free.  All this, of course, is personal opinion.    Don't do your sound editing without a programmable mouse.  You need to have the frequent commands at your finger tips when editing sound.     Take the time to assign hot keys to your frequent commands, how and where you want them.     Invest in dual monitors.  Video cards are cheap, monitors are virtually free at thrift stores or garage sales, flatscreens are inexpensive now.  I use dual 19\\" monitors for my editing, and a third smaller flatscreen for other apps.  Couldn't be happy without them.      Other notes on the H4n:  If you need a power supply with a longer cord the Tascam PS-P520 power adaptor works perfectly and reaches about 12'.  Identical connector, same voltage and polarity, twice the rating, twice the cord reach.    If you are using the unit outdoors or near even the slightest breeze you need the windscreen, and I would recommend an aftermarket fuzzy one.  Without a windscreen ANY breeze sounds like a tidal wave crashing over the recorder.      Also, don't expect to hold the unit in your hand while recording, any movement with your hand sounds like a building falling on top of the recorder.    The H4n comes with a flawed extra, beware.  It comes with a mic clip adapter, which is shaped like the stem of a microphone and screws into the back of the recorder so you can put the recorder in a mic stand.  Two problems.  The adapter is too small for the average mic clip on a mic stand.  I had to wrap mine with a thin piece of leather so a mic clip would hold it securely.  But really beware.  The adaptor thing, about 4 inches long, is made of two parts of plastic, the cone part and the top part that has a metal screw thread sticking out of it.  The two pieces of plastic are glued together.  The glue doesn't hold!  You screw the thing into the back of your recorder and stick it in a mic clip on a mic stand 6' off the floor... and the adapter comes apart! If you are lucky your precious recorder just falls into your hand... if you are not lucky it falls to the floor!  I had to use primer and Black Plastic Pipe dope to fuse the two pieces of plastic together so I wasn't risking having my recorder fall to the floor from 6' up!    As far as cables go, watch out for Hosa 1 / 4 \\" connectors.  First time I used Hosa cables I could barely get them disconnected from the recorder... it took way too much force to remove them.  The unit doesn't play well with Hosa connectors.  Other makes fit perfectly.    Before you buy, check out the Zoom Q3 video recorder.  If you are looking to record just with the built in mics this thing is cheaper, has the same mics.  Don't expect to carry it around and get clear sounding recordings, as stated above, it will pick up handling noise terribly.    Enjoy the H4n.  Hopefully Zoom fixes the line level issue and then they will have the perfect recorder.

0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown sticks to a winning formula. In the timespan of one day, Robert Langdon goes through a dramatic thrilling adventure. Similar to 'The Da Vinci Code', Dan Brown is excellent in mixing history, religion, philosophy, science and legends to make the story even more compelling. I could not rest until I finished the book - highly entertaining, frantic and breathtaking!
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I think people should continue with the one star reviews so that everyone is very clear on which version they are looking at.  Unless of course you actually prefer the Oprah version (which would be baffling).    David Attenborough is an excellent narrator.  I'm not sure what the deal is with releasing other versions (with different narrators).    Now they are even going a step further and airing the Oprah version on launch, at least with Planet Earth they aired the David Attenborough version first.    A lot of people that liked Planet Earth mistakenly ordered the DVDs with Sigourney...so this is just a warning to make sure you check which version you are ordering and be sure you are getting the one you want.    Let them know you want quality narration and vote with your $$$.    Update: Tried to watch the first two eps on TV and it was horrid.  At least Sigourney wasn't terrible (she just wasn't as good as David Attenborough). Oprah = FAIL or to put it another way \\"a big bag of hurt\\".
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|This movie was unjustly reviewed.  I like it.  I like the whole series and this is an integral part of the story.  That it got thumbs down is good news for us fans because it is reflected in a cheaper price, and you gotta like that.  Buy it.  Watch it. It's entertaining from start to end.
160094048X|3.0|I loved Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, and the copy I got two and a half years ago is mightily dog-eared.  And when Veganomicon came out I was over the moon.  But this just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />In fairness, I've developed some \\"issues\\" since I became a vegan.  First, I can't tolerate wheat, oats or corn (among other things), so I need gluten-free options.  Second, one of my children is very allergic to nuts of all kinds.  Third, another child is sensitive to sugar and therefore I need to use a lot of agave when I bake.  It would, of course, be unfair to demand that a straight-up vegan cookbook address all of these issues, but they are actually pretty surmountable for the creative cook.  I thank the authors for their gluten-free mix (including a non-almond flour option), but I was shaking my head when they were explaining agave substitutions.  It's not that hard!<br /><br />I was able to put much of that aside when I got the book... and I was still pretty unmoved.  Maybe it's the photographs- they're just not as gorgeously colorful as the cupcake book.  And frankly, some of the products just don't look that good.  Deluxe Cocoa Brownies on page 132 look really, really dry, as do the NYC Black and White Cookies on page 161.  (Although, in fairness, maybe Boston's Black and Whites are traditionally creamier.)  Having made my own vegan versions of these, I know that they can be vegan and luscious- and since these weren't in the \\"wholesome\\" chapter, I don't see why they'd skimp.<br /><br />The \\"wholesome\\" chapter also seemed lacking, and not just in the photographs.  It's personal taste, of course, but then this is a personal review.  I just had no desire to try something called Apricot Almond Quinoa Chews or 21st Century Carob Chip Cookies.<br /><br />So why 3 stars?  Because when these guys are good, they're really good.  The bar cookies are fabulous, and they're reworkings of favorites like Oreos, Milanos (Minonos), Samoas and Stella D'oro Swiss cookies were just about pitch-perfect.  Cookie aisle of the supermarket, watch out.<br /><br />I think it's still worth having, it just didn't rock my world like their other offerings.Cookie aisle of the supermarket, watch out.

B000JMKNV0|5.0|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie... and I am so glad I did. I love this style of writing, and this was my first Lehane book. I am hooked. Wow. Some were disappointed in the ending, but I thought it was perfect. Kept me turning page after page. Ready for my next one...
B001AQT11M|5.0|As a child, I loved Snow White.  It's a story you always remember as something wonderful from your childhood.  I bought this for my granddaughter who is 3.  Her mom says she loves Snow White and keeps watching it over and over again.  I thought some of the scarier parts would bother her but I guess not.  Surprise.  She is old enough to realize it is just a story but a wonderful one to pass down through the ages.
0061703257|4.0|This was an extremely nice distraction from all the thought-provoking literature I've been reading nowadays.<br /><br />I think one of the HUGE differences between \\"literature\\" and \\"popular fiction\\" is the reading level the book is written on.  No, I don't think one is better than the other-they both have their place in life.  Honestly, popular fiction is usually a much quicker read for me and I'm riveted to my seat to discover what happens next.<br /><br />But that's the subject of a different (and upcoming) post :)<br /><br />Set in the 1950's, Shutter Island by Dennis Lehane is about a U.S. Marshal, Teddy Daniels, who is called to a criminal psychiatric hospital to search for an escaped patient, a woman who murdered her children.<br /><br />This is my first introduction to Lehane's work-I've not read or seen his best known work, Mystic River-and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />In Shutter Island, the point of view placed you over Teddy's shoulder.  This is probably my favorite point-of-view for a story-it's also one of the most used for the advantages it gives.  For this novel, it was key-you see the story's reality through the eyes of the character.  Any other character's point of view would have given you a completely different story and not had the effect that Lehane was looking for.<br /><br />If I was going to suggest a few of the best examples of the use of this particular point-of-view, this novel would definitely be on the list.<br /><br />The story works and works well, however I will admit that the ending wasn't a huge surprise.  No, I didn't see it coming, but I also didn't try to figure out (most of) the clues when they were given.<br /><br />That's fine with me-when the ending was finally revealed, I was definitely engaged with the characters and, by that time, surprise wasn't an issue.  I could swear that I've seen this entire story done before in a different way-ending and all-so, for me, it doesn't have that completely \\"unique\\" feel to it.  And that's ok too.<br /><br />Sometimes it's nice to sit back and just be led down the story by the author rather than to try to figure out what the author was doing.  Suspense is nice-the reader should always WANT to know what's going on.  Adding clues the reader can figure out is fun as well, but you want to be careful about revealing too much through those clues.  I've read a few reviews of this novel that say the ending was obvious-I think those readers figured out the clues before the author actually wanted them to.<br /><br />So, for a quick and fun read, this was a really good book.  I've heard there's a movie out based on the book with Leonardo DiCaprio and a few other stars directed by Martin Scoresce.  I think I'll pass on the movie.  While yeah, it might be entertaining, I don't feel the need to see it performed on the screen.story by the author rather than to try to figure out what the author was doing.

B00000F6LQ|5.0|I ran this for my movie club. They loved it and found it extremely funny - both those who had seen it long ago and those seeing it for the first time.     I thought I might find the movie religiously offensive - but it was not at all offensive.    I know the Pythons wanted the movie to be completely absurd and nonsensical pointless.     Maybe humans can never reach that without some of themselves showing through.      In fact I thought the movie had some warmth and affection towards King Arthur and the whole story. Also made some good points about society.    I think the English have sought the Holy Grail for two thousand years - and still do not know what it exactly is(multiple theories), where it is (let's hope not in France) or even IF it is.     So some frustation about it is warrented. SPOILER: I thought bringing modernday characters in showed the lack of progress since 600 AD in finding the Holy Grail.
0812973992|5.0|I love Colm McCann's writing voice, and have witnessed how it has developed over the years. This, in my view, is a beautiful book.

B00064WSN2|4.0|Anyone who loves this album, as I do, need to buy \\"McDonald & Giles,\\" the album Ian McDonald and Michael Giles recorded during this time.  This will provide a much needed insight into what could have been.  The \\"Birdman Suite\\" on McDonald and Giles was a work in progress as far back as 1968 and was a candidate for the next Crimson record while they were on tour in 1969.  Then, McDonald and Giles quit, taking \\"Birdman\\" with them along with several other excellent songs such as \\"Flight of the Ibis\\" which was the ORIGINAL \\"Cadence & Cascade\\" and it is FAR superior.  As a matter of fact, ALL the material on McDonald and Giles is excellent and in the hands of the original Crimson would have made \\"Poseidon\\" a devastating album. But...that's the way it goes!

B001F0WXY0|5.0|**** This is a quick note about the Kindle edition of Dune called \\"Dune (40th Anniversary Edition)\\".  Amazon and the publisher should be ashamed to be marketing this Kindle version with so many misspellings.  This is one of the top classic Science Fiction titles of all time.  I am here to tell you to that this Kindle edition is not worthy of your funds.  I could excuse a couple of errors in the book, but the Kindle edition is **RIFE** with them.  A major Kindle  disappointment that I will not soon forget.  I have purchased *many* other Kindle books and witnessed misspellings, but was able to forgive due to infrequency and more obscure book titles.  But to see so many misspellings in such a renown title was rather disgusting.  I had planned to buy the other Dune books on Kindle but will not do so now, solely due to this issue.  I have better ways of spending ~$40 than to spend it on products that evidently the publisher and seller care nothing about.  Can't express in words just how angry I was to see this book given this treatment.  One final note, I saw another post that said the Kindle edition had the same misspellings as the original book.  I have no idea what Kindle edition this person was comparing to what print edition, but I am here to tell you that this is NOT the case with this Kindle edition.  The misspellings in this Kindle edition are NUMEROUS, GROSS in their error, and DO NOT match the paperback book I own of the same title  (I have Dune, 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback - the multitude of errors I checked are not found in this print edition).<br /><br />As for the book itself, what is there to say that has not already been said?  THIS IS A MASTERPIECE.  If you love Science Fiction, and have not read this book, then you do not know Science Fiction.  Get it, read it, enjoy.<br /><br />5 Stars for Frank Herbert and Dune<br />1 Star for Amazon and Penquin Group.

B002E01LL6|3.0|When I decided to buy this movie I was so excited. I felt really let down.  The story is just missing something.  The fight scenes weren't all that great.  I've never seen Channing Tatum as an idiot until I watched this movie.  And Terrence Howard?  This was so not his role.  There just didn't seem to be any chemistry between these actors.  It was too forced and the plot was cheesy and only half developed.  If I had seen this movie prior to purchase, it would NOT have been a purchase. Rent or borrow it BEFORE you decide you want to own it.

B0007939NO|5.0|If you love musicals as much as I do, this will become one of your favorites too. This is one of the most romantic stories I believe I have ever watched. What makes this DVD special are the \\"Special Features\\" which includes 3 outtakes, one of which is a dance number that was left out of the final product. It is so beautiful you have to wonder why it was not included. Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse, what more can you say? And this was one of Van Johnson's best roles. This is a good romantic movie to watch with someone special.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Last night's episode about pottery and sailing classes made me laugh so hysterically, I almost burst my gall bladder. No TV show has done that to me in years! Just too smart, too funny!  Get it, you'll thank me.
0307408833|1.0|You must be kidding me.  I'm real glad Erin McKenna has a clueless media machine behind her because she's made lots of money, apparently by baking for people with a few, specific allergies.  \\"Mostly Gluten Free?\\"  c'mon.  Oh and by the way if you've had gluten allergies for a while you're probably also not digesting beans very well either.  Guess what she replaces the gluten/wheat with?  Well a garbanzo/fava bean mix and in the entire scones chapter, spelt!  Well, whoopee for her and her bank account but that doesn't spell \\"allergy free\\" to me at all.  So unless you truly only have a \\"wheat\\" allergy it isn't worth it.  Trying to replace that flour blend only ends in tears and a full trash can.

B002WCLG3O|1.0|I'm not sure how some of these clips ever got produced, they have every annoying amine cliche, many are boring to watch and worst of all, depart from the established Halo storyline. Total waste of time. If you have any love for the Halo story or just good story telling in general, don't bother with these videos.
B00288KNLS|5.0|This is a great movie with a horror theme, but hardly terrifying.  A young girl moves into an old house broken into apartments.  There is an empty apartment there where a secret world lives and the girl Coraline runs into.  Coraline goes through a bricked up door and finds another mother and another father very similar to her own but nicer and more interested in her.  She is invited to stay with them forever if only she agrees to allow them to sew buttons into her eyes.  Coraline finds this wonderful secret world has a terrible dark side.  The author Neil Gaiman wrote the book that the story comes from and it is great.  I used the Graphic novel in school and followed it up with the movie.  My students are middle school students and we had a great time.  The kids loved the book and the movie.  It wasn't too scary but very intriguing to them.
B0012GVKVY|5.0|This film borrows its title from a collection of short stories written by Isaac Asimov (there actually is no individual story or novel called \\"I, Robot\\").  It also borrows several concepts and terminology from Asimov's \\"Robot\\" series, particularly the \\"Three Laws of Robotics\\", the first of which is: \\"A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm\\".  The movie received a lot of criticism from classic sci-fi fans because it is not really an adaptation of any of Asimov's stories, and because some of the action actually VIOLATES the Laws of Robotics.    However, this movie has a deeper connection to classic science fiction than many fans realize.  This movie combines themes from Asimov's \\"Robot\\" stories with ANOTHER classic science fiction story.  This story is \\"With Folded Hands\\" by Jack Williamson.  In the Jack Williamson story, a bunch of black robots appear on earth ostensibly to \\"help\\" human beings but in reality to protect them from any danger at all.  By the end of the story humans are being lobotomized and kept safely in padded rooms where they can't be harmed.    By combining these two themes, the movie makers are addressing the central conundrum of Asimov's \\"Laws\\", namely, how far can you go to protect humans before they're no longer human?  In addition, the movie's ending addresses another theme from Asimov's \\"Robot\\" stories that is actually much deeper than the \\"Laws\\": as robots drift towards becoming self-aware sentient beings, how will this affect them and humanity?  What will they (and we) turn into?  On the surface this movie appears to pay minimal service to Asimov's writings, but in reality it is built solidly upon a foundation of classic science fiction ideas.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|You don't have to be a Michael fan to realize the talent he had in everything that he did.  He had vision both on and off stage when it came to the creativity that made his shows and videos so fantastic.  This last performance was going to be completely brilliant.  One really interesting aspect was the black and white of Rita Hayworth and the gangster three-D of him sliding down the stairs.  How was that going to happen?  He was the \\"Smooth Criminal\\" :-).  He knew when to make songs \\"simmer\\" and to make his dancing \\"sizzle\\" to slow things down to make the crowd go wild.  We will never know just how fantastic these last concerts were going to be, unfortunately, but at least we got a glimpse into the perfectionist Michael was and how he became so popular and famous for his songs, his dancing, his shows and his complete talent.
B003102JDM|2.0|Until the last few minutes of this movie, its hero Larry Gopnik is both (a) a perfectly good man, and (b) a spineless worm who lets the world walk over him.  Neither trait is humanly credible.  Consequently, the movie is too divorced from reality to have much meaning, even as a comedy.  And since spinelessness is hardly admirable, one cannot say that Larry is an attractive or sympathetic figure.    The movie is also plagued by elements that remain--how to put it?--unassimilated.  Take its curious prologue, which is a parable about moral ambiguity.  Someone who appears to be a revered elder and a good samaritan may actually be a demon in disguise--or maybe not; it's hard to tell.  But the film itself is about a latter-day Job who suffers the insults, afflictions and outrages of the world:  an unambiguously good man to whom unambiguously bad things happen.  In short, the prologue has nothing to do with the movie.  It's merely the Coen brothers indulging themselves to no purpose, and not for the first time.    The same is true of Rabbi Marshak quoting Grace Slick.  Yes, it's a send-up of a false sage.  But it's also shallow Boomer populism, telling us, with a collusive wink, that we can get as much wisdom from trippy rock songs as from the learning of the ages.  I don't find that to be credible either.
B002ID08QS|5.0|Ordering and delivery was simple and brought no unexpected surprises.  George Benson's release here is my favorite listen and will be for a while.

B0029LHX1W|4.0|The author tells this story along three paths: the ugliness of the Stalin regime upon Russia; the internal struggle of the human spirit that emerges; and a mystery that challenges the reader.

0545123267|4.0|Shiver is a love story about a girl that is obsessed with some wolves after they bit her when she was a little girl.  One of the werewolves saves her life after she was bitten and she is in love with him.  He becomes human after being shot and they finally have a chance to actually get to know each other.  I thought that the book was a nice love story and had a better plot line than Twilight did.  You can tell that the two main characters are actually experiencing true love for each other and it was a very sweet story.  The werewolves are not portrayed as evil beings, but as humans who can't help what they have become.  I think that this was a good novel and I recommend it for people that like love stories.

B00328G4V6|4.0|If you approach this as a new Hendrix album, you will likely find yourself pretty disappointed.  \\"Valleys of Neptune\\" is a fine track that hasn't seen much of a release in the past (it did show up in different form on the \\"Lifelines\\" box 20 years ago), but everything else here is either a remake (\\"Stone Free,\\" \\"Fire\\"), a studio recording of a live staple (the extended \\"Red House,\\" \\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\"), or an instrumental take that probably needed some more work for an album release.  With the right expectations, though, this is a fine release.  I listen to this as if someone handed me a really great rehearsal/jam session tape of the Experience shortly before they broke up, which is when these recordings date from.  There are few overdubs, and several guest musicians (including Hendrix's fine later day bass player Billy Cox) to fit that framework.  The track sequencing even helps to support that idea.  We start with Hendrix excitingly trying out his new arrangement of \\"Stone Free.\\"  After another new song and a few blues jams, the band kicks into a fired-up, instrumental take of \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" for what seems like no other reason other than it's fun.  Later they sort of flub an embryonic take of \\"Night Bird Flying\\" (\\"Ships Passing Through the Night\\"), and as bands are ought to do while rehearsing, redeem their self-esteem by ripping through an older song that they've played incessantly live and know by heart (\\"Fire\\").  The rest of the album sort of drifts into an aimless jamming vibe (especially if you have the Target CD with two extra, instrumental tracks) before calling it a day.  Fortunately for the listener, Hendrix jamming, even aimlessly, is pretty dang impressive.  Mitch Mitchell comes across quite well here too.  He seems to be trying everything on the drums, and 95% of it works out great.<br /><br />No, this doesn't work as a proper album, but it is one of the best \\"official\\" bootlegs that you're likely to find.  While this is not on the scale of Hendrix's proper three Experience albums, it is a very intimate, human collection of recordings, and is far better than the doctored posthumous albums clogging up Hendrix's discography (I'm looking at you \\"War Heroes,\\" \\"Crash Landing\\" and \\"Voodoo Soup,\\" although \\"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\\" is welcome to hang out with the Experience albums) and flows better than past outtake compilations like \\"South Saturn Delta.\\"x's proper three Experience albums, it is a very intimate, human collection of recordings, and is far better than the doctored posthumous albums clogging up Hendrix's discography (I'm looking at you \\"War Heroes,\\" \\"Crash Landing\\" and \\"Voodoo Soup,\\" although \\"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\\" is welcome to hang out with the Experience albums) and flows better than past outtake compilations like \\"South Saturn Delta.\\"
1439148953|4.0|Colm Toibin (pronounced \\"Collum Toe-bean'\\" for those who don't speak Irish)'s most recent novel is lovely, quiet and, ultimately, quite moving. It is less \\"flashy\\" than [[ASIN:0743250419 The Master: A Novel]] or [[ASIN:0743203313 The Blackwater Lightship: A Novel]]--both short-listed for the Man Booker Prize. But in its quiet economy of means, the narrative slowly builds and by the end, you find yourself on tenterhooks to see how the books ends, how the heroine finally chooses her life. Toibin's writing is fine, but in its straightforward simplicity, it nearly disappears. This book is a wonderful addition to Toibin's work and an absolute pleasure to read.
B00328G4XY|3.0|5 Stars for the music, which was brilliant when it was first released and still a classic.  Jimi Hendrix's untimely death was a disaster for rock music still felt today.  There's considerable sonic difference among the tracks.  It starts off rather grating, but smooths out as the album unfolds.<br /><br />Zero Stars for the packaging.  Digi-packs are a pain if defective, and this one adds absolutely nothing to the music.  Looking at amazon's photo you'd think you were getting something special celebrating a new release of \\"Electric Ladyland,\\" when it's actually just cheap plastic trays glued over photographs of basically nothing.  Since the booklet fits into a standard CD case, I wound up putting the discs into a plastic 2-CD case and used the back tray artwork from another version.<br /><br />The DVD misses the mark as well.  It isn't that the comments by Chas Chandler, Noel Redding, and Eddie Kramer are worthless, but they should have been interspersed between concert videos of Hendrix playing some signature tunes.<br /><br />If you have a previous version and don't want the DVD, skip this one.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|I saw this movie first years ago and have not been able to find it again until an Amazon search.

0143039431|4.0|More than grapes and more than wrath, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a story about everlasting hope and compassion, despite pervasive hardship, poverty and death.  The Joad family, uprooted from their 40-acre Oklahoma farm during the late 1930s by economic hard times, brought on by drought and dust storms and exacerbated by corporate greed and efficiencies of big agriculture, journey westward to California because they \\"got to\\" in order to stay alive, make a decent living, and retain a tenuous sliver of human dignity.<br /><br />Through strife, exhaustion and personal tragedy, the Joads maintain their faith that the sun will shine tomorrow, no matter how heavily the rain falls today.  In sharp contrast to Grampa's dream to \\"get me a whole bunch a grapes off a bush . . . [and] squash `em on my face an' let `em run offen my chin,\\" and the family's hope that \\"it'll be all different out there--plenty work, an' ever'thing nice an' green, an' little white houses an' oranges growin' aroun',\\" California for the newcomer Joads is synonymous with difficulty finding work, menial wages when work is available, harsh living conditions, blatant animosity towards \\"Okies\\" from the local residents, constant money shortages, and always being hungry.  By story's end, we are left wondering how the Joads are any better off after being flooded out of their railcar encampment next to a cotton field in central California, but we somehow find solace and comfort in the poignancy of Rosasharn's bighearted willingness to give from her own breast the precious life she has to share.<br /><br />According to Steinbeck (and I think he is right on this point), the most generous people are those who have the least material wealth and fewest possessions.  \\"For the quality of owning freezes you forever into `I,' and cuts you off forever from the `we.'\\"  Further, in the words of (reformed) ex-preacher Casy (whose voice is probably Steinbeck's), \\"a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big one.\\"  If only each of us, in our consumerist 21st century material bliss, could take this message to heart, perhaps our ever-so-efficient, profit-oriented, techno-mechanical world might become a friendlier, more compassionate place better fit for our one big human soul.<br /><br />From a stylistic point of view, I found the many interludes juxtaposed between the primary chapters of the book more distracting than informative, particularly the ones written in stream-of-consciousness form.  If the reason for including these \\"extraneous\\" interludes is to provide background information to complement the \\"Joad\\" chapters, then, in my opinion, Steinbeck should have adhered to a more documentary form in these sections, doing the research to develop the interludes into a more substantive and factual picture of the historical setting, condition of American society during the Great Depression years, and ironies of California as a land of boundless opportunity.h of us, in our consumerist 21st century material bliss, could take this message to heart, perhaps our ever-so-efficient, profit-oriented, techno-mechanical world might become a friendlier, more compassionate place better fit for our one big human soul.

B000067DGX|5.0|Monsters Inc. is a delightfully funny film by Pixar and Disney.  Released in 2001, Monsters, Inc. reflects the modern human world in many ways, with production quotas, rolling blackouts, and families and children in bustling Monsteropolis.<br /><br />Almost an Abbott and Costello film, Sully & his assistant and best friend, Mike Wazowski.  Randall is Sully's greatest competitor, a scaly, evil chameleon with greed at his heart.<br /><br />Sully does the scaring of children through doors that when connected to children's bedroom closets become a doorway into the human dimension.  Energy is collected from the screams and powers the Monsteropolis.<br /><br />But kids are not getting as scared as they used to.  To increase the quota, there is corruption and intrigue afoot, which is realistic for an animated film.<br /><br />The adult gags and references, such as Harryhausen's Restaurant, are fun to see.  Also, with children being seen as a threat to Monster-dom, there are great penalties for even the slightest contamination from the child's world.  A sock on one unlucky monster's back is enough for panic by the yellow squad of the CDA: Child Detection Agency.<br /><br />The animators and writers made Randall the complete opposite of Sully.  Where Sully is kind, intelligent and gentle, Randall is sly, secretive and evil.  Randall will stop at nothing to get his own ends.<br /><br />The one-eyed Mike is fun to watch and see how the animators give a one-eyed guy such emotion.  He's pretty silly too where he just doesn't get what people are trying to say to him.<br /><br />Crime does not pay and making lemonade out of lemons are good lessons for kids.<br /><br />The \\"blooper\\" reel at the end is great, and the jazz music is well done.<br /><br />Great entertainment from Disney.<br /><br />The voice actors include:<br /><br />John Goodman<br />Billy Crystal<br />Mary Gibbs<br />Steve Buscemi<br />James Coburn<br />Jennifer Tilly<br /><br />Other Pixar Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0030IIYWA Toy Story (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo w/ Blu-ray Packaging)]]<br />[[ASIN:B001EOQWF8 Wall-E (Two-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars (Widescreen Edition)]]o-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray]]]  [[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars (Widescreen Edition)]]
B000W91RUG|5.0|I was introduced to this show by our friends on Hilton Head Island in January. I have not stop watching it since and can not get enough of it.  For an engineer / scientist, I can appreciate the \\"geeky\\" life these 4 guys lead and their interactions with the more normal girl next door.  Sheldon Cooper steals the show with his inability to understand the relationships between normal people let alone the relationships with more \\"normal\\" engineers / scientists.  I own both seasons of The Big Bang Theory now and record the show on our DVR religiously.  I look forward to when the 3rd season is available.
B0026RHR6K|5.0|This series was absolutely excellent!! This was recommended to me by a couple friends so I bought it with little expectation and I was completely surprised how good it was. I actually rank it up there with one of the best shows I've EVER watched in my life. The only negative thing about it is that it only played for 4 seasons. I found myself so sad when I finished it because I didn't want it to end. The cast was great, graphics with the ship to ship battles were excellent and realistic, the storyline was superb with excitement and unexpected twists throughout. An absolute MUST watch, you won't be disappointed. Never mind all the complaints about the packaging it's not as bad as many of these critics are posting and this show is so good you'll be more than willing to overlook it. This set comes complete with the miniseries that starts the series and the unrated version of \\"BSG-Razor\\" movie to start season 4, Enjoy.

B002UTDPE2|5.0|For those of us of a certain age, this performance needs no recommendation. It was universally considered THE PERFORMANCE. The only thing we are interested in is the sound. Personally, I have at least two other recordings of this performance and the sound is wretched and I really did not expect too much from this edition. The sound is not great but vastly improved.It resembles a fairly decent early LP. You can actually hear individual instruments in the orchestra and the voices come through clearly.       But for those who are new to this performance, you are in for a real theatrical experience, and that is the principal value of this performance. There are around three or four other performance of Maria Callas as Violetta, and, in my view, two of them are really wonderful (One with Alfredo Kraus and one from London). Similarly, there are a number of other performance with Di Stefano  and Bastianini (sic?), but this La Scala performance under the musical guidance of Guilini and the production expertise of Luciano Visconti is a real magical theatrical experience.    All of the performers are thrillingly alive to both the drama and the musical qualities of this really wonderful opera. Callas expert, John Ardoin wrote that if he could have only one recording of Callas, it would be her \\"Lucia\\" with Karajan, but I'm sure this \\"Traviata\\" would be next. Don't expect great sound but it is a once in a life time performance.
0785134352|1.0|Kick-Ass poses the question, \\"Why aren't there any real superheroes?\\" and then promptly answers it, \\"Because they'd get the **** kicked out of them.\\"     Young Dave Lizewski figures this out for himself pretty swiftly. He dresses up, grabs some weaponry, works out for a bit, and then goes and gets himself thoroughly beaten up by the city's criminal element. Thankfully, he lives in the YouTube era - so, despite his repeated visits to the hospital, he somehow gets a cult following. With great fame comes great respectability - so much so that other 'super'-heroes begin popping up... and the criminal element starts getting really irritated.    Essentially, Kick-Ass takes the same issues that Millar has already addressed in 1985 and The Ultimates, and grinds them into the reader's face with a cheese-grater. Comic violence, see, is REALLY REALLY MESSY. Whereas in 1985 it was terrifying... and in The Ultimates fairly modern and interesting, in Kick-Ass, violence is merely another way of getting cheap juvenile laughs. The entire book is an S&M treatise. Dave is lumped upon in every way - mentally, emotionally and physically - for the reader's entertainment. We're \\"ok\\" with that because he's clearly a disturbed figure that needs the thumping to get by. This is the \\"choice\\" he makes (not say, to get therapy - that's less funny and doesn't allow Romita to draw gooey lumps of brain matter on every page).    For everything decent that Millar writes, he churns out three more titles that leave me feeling physically ill.     I, do, however, hold out some fleeting hope for the movie. Wanted was an abysmal comic that became a sub-par movie. If Kick-Ass is improved to the same degree by the screen-writing team, it could almost be an average film.

B0035G9ABQ|3.0|Other reviewers have mentioned a lack of coherency and I couldn't agree more...it feels like a random mix of rap songs with almost no singular artistic vision. Guests make up the vast majority of the CD. It's not a bad hip hop record in its own right but Gorillaz fans will likely be disappointed by how little presence \\"the Gorillaz\\" seem to have on their own CD.     To get a real taste of The Gorillaz pick up Demon Days. Plastic Beach has a couple really good Gorillaz songs but overall it's rather forgettable. It's almost as if Damon Albarn wanted to make a new solo CD but, in an effort to make it sell, forced a couple Gorillaz songs into it so he could call it a \\"Gorillaz album.\\"     I realize this group's always had its own style but this album just doesn't feel like them....though several songs are quite good, nothing reaches the heights of Feel Good Inc or the Demon Days song off their last  CD.     Many Gorillaz fans will wonder what they've purchased. It's worth a listen or two but don't expect it to live up the the band you know and love.

B000BEZQ18|5.0|The Brokeback Mountain CD soundtrack has only a bit of Gustavo's beautiful original film soundtrack (which I've been searching for all over the place and cannot find).  This CD has only a few sections of his score, and many recordings by several singers whose songs are beautiful and fit the film exactly. (Some songs are written by Gustavo).    I loved the film so much and I do love this CD.  The beautiful ballad \\"A love that will never grow old\\"; \\"He was a friend of mine\\"; \\"I don't want to say goodbye\\", etc., bring me to tears - as the film certainly film.  All through the CD, as thru the film, the element of sadness and tragedy of Ennis' and Jack's lives is prominent. A beautiful love story which ends, sadly, in tragedy for both.  (I know the original film soundtrack has to be out there somewhere; I'm continuing my search.  \\"The Wings\\" alone the film's theme)is worth it!)

B001NEK2GE|4.0|It's about time a game pad was made by a company that knows how to produce peripherals. Saitek has the ability, but they made the mistake of trying to copy the terribly designed, though innovative for its time, N52. You can't really blame Nostromo, since they basically had to pioneer the market and had nothing to go on, but still. Until now, gamers had to settle for awkwardly shaped units that felt as though they were constructed from actual garbage. I mean literally materials pulled from a dumpster. Yes, the Logitech is the most expensive of the major pads, and for good reason.     The screen is pointless, though. There's nothing it can show that isn't better done on your monitor, at least not for actual gaming (the people who mentioned using it for MMORPG stats need to look into addons). It can do things like display system temp I think, which is cool, but not what you buy it for. You shouldn't be diverting your eyes from the screen to look at a tiny LCD above your left hand. If you really want that feature, get a G series keyboard; at least the screen is in front of you. It doesn't hurt anything, though, except for adding to the price unnecessarily. But if you're serious about gaming, you shouldn't be using a non-mechanical switch keyboard anyway.

It all came down to emotion. There are characters that I loathed and loved, and then there were characters that I didn't know how I felt about. When authors are able to develop characters that can cause an emotional connection with the readers, they not only have the readers engaged, but they also have the readers in what I call this conflict of emotion (who is right? Which way is the moral, ethical way of doing things? Are the characters being selfish? etc). Engaging the readers with the novel is important, which is why My Sister's Keeper is such a success.     The movie and book ended differently, which is what took me by surprise. I saw the movie before actually reading the book; therefore, when I was reading the book and finished it, it really left me speechless because it was not what I expected. Was it better or worse? To be honest, I liked both endings, but in my opinion, the ending of the novel left a greater impact. I'm not too much in favor of being the one who spoils the end, so I won't, but if you have seen the movie, don't expect it to follow too closely to the novel.     At the heart of the novel and the book, you have this issue of Anna being a donor and why she was born. Were her parents right in creating her for to save Kate? Is that ethical? Is Anna being the loving sister by obeying Kate's wishes to file a lawsuit against her parents? What about Jesse? How is he affected by Kate's illness? He's not a donor, but he's invisible...no one seems to care about he does or how he is affected. I believe that the theme that encompasses this plot is invisibility. All the characters are invisible...their needs, their wants...what is that they truly want and need? Why does Sara fight so hard to keep Kate alive? Maybe Kate is Sara's lifeline? Why does Campbell become Anna's lawyer, even though he is apprehensive about it? Is it more than just the fact that he can't control his own body? Maybe as the case progresses, he feels more of an attachment to Anna? What about Brian? He is an honorable father figure, but why does he not stand for what he believes is right? Why does he let Sara \\"rule\\" the show? It is not until halfway through the novel that he starts voicing his opinion, but what keeps him from doing it in the first place? Is it fear?     Maybe I've read too much into this novel, but I really enjoyed it. I did read it for pleasure, but the issues at hand were more than surface. It challenged me, especially with the conflict of emotion. Which way is right? Which way is wrong?     Purchase the book. It's well-worth the read. And rent the movie too: it's different, but let's face it. Most of the time, movies are different from the books.
B001676320|5.0|This is a fantastic concert DVD with two of the best bands of our time performing both together and separately.  The sound engineering is superb, and the camera work is great too.  One of the best I have heard in a very long time.

0061703257|5.0|Personally, I hate it when people write dissertations on books in these reviews.  I don't care for a book report, a literary analysis or how literate the person writing the review is, I just want to know if the book was any good.  I've read a ton of psych-sus books, and this one, once the ending blew me out of the water, I will have to read again.  This is a MUST READ...twice.  Great book!
0545123267|4.0|This is a great book that I have loaned out to many, and all have enjoyed it.  It is a young adult book, but one that has a good story that appeals to many age groups.  The romance is sweet without being sappy and the werewolf angle works well within the romance.  I admit that I like my vampires and werewolves to be \\"good guys\\" at least good most of the time.  I was thrilled to find out there is a sequel and can't wait to read it!
1594488916|4.0|For those of us who battle/revel in our own obsession with books, Ms. Bartlett has written an interesting little volume.  In it, she tells the story of John Gilkey, a book thief, and Ken Sanders, a bookseller with the skills to catch book thieves.  Along the way, she takes us to book fairs and antiquarian bookstores, teaches a little about valuable books, and introduces us to a number of people in the trade.<br /><br />Two things stand out in Bartlett's book.  First, how easy it is to steal even quite valuable books.  At the height of his success, it seems Gilkey was stealing credit card numbers from his customers as a salesman at Saks, and using them to make purchases via internet and in person.  Second, how little interest there is in prosecuting book-stealers even when they've stolen tens of thousands of dollars in merchandise.  Despite all his larceny, Gilkey has paid little for his crimes.  It makes one wonder why most of us--poor collectors who still dream big--are basically honest in our dealings.<br /><br />Bartlett makes a stab at understanding Gilkey's mindset.  She interviews him and visits his home and other book stashes.  Still, she doesn't seem to make much headway in understanding him, or why any person's obsessions end up making him cross the line.  This is a tough question, of course, that even dedicated professionals have yet to unravel satisfactorily, but it is a disappointment that she can't draw stronger conclusion.<br /><br />In the end, I don't think this is a book that can find a wide audience.  On the other hand, anyone with an interest in the world of book collecting should take a look.  It's an easy an entertaining read.
B0034JGBM0|4.0|I must preface this review by saying that I have not yet watched the film that accompanies this release, so my opinions are based on the music alone. Having seen the White Stripes live at their first performance at Madison Square Garden, I know how energetic their music can be in concert and with this, their first live release, I was very curious to see how well this energy would translate to recorded media.<br /><br />In 2007, Jack White and Meg White started a tour across Canada, making sure to hit every province along the way. Ten years into their musical journey together, they had never toured our northern neighbors, so with the help of filmmaker Emmett Malloy, they started their journey in support of their album Icky Thump and documented the entire trek for their fans.<br /><br />With heavy Scottish influences present throughout Icky Thump, Under Great White Northern Lights, opens rather appropriately with bagpipes to announce the band's arrival to the stage. \\"Let's Shake Hands\\", \\"Black Math\\", \\"Little Ghost\\", and \\"Blue Orchid\\" start things off which has the White Stripes hitting the ground running.<br /><br />The energy clearly builds with every song which is completely true of the real live experience. The emotion Jack White puts into each song is stunning. On \\"Blue Orchid\\", he presses through each line as if using his last breath to convey the importance of his words. When the music slows down on tracks such as \\"The Union Fever\\", the emotion is even more prevalent in Jack's voice and the slow swing beat provided by Meg follows along with the flow of the song perfectly.<br /><br />Those new to the band, like much of Canada was before this tour, should first listen to their studio releases before picking up this live album, but the track listing does read like a greatest hits album. The White Stripes are excellent at mixing the old in with the new to please every fan in the audience. One of the true highlights of this live performance is a new, slowed down rendition of their first big hit, \\"Fell in Love with a Girl.\\" It's moments like these that showcase how the White Stripes are able to keep all of their music fresh and that is truly what makes this album a must own for any fan.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Beck, The Hives<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Fell in Love with a Girl\\"ell in Love with a Girl.\\" It's moments like these that showcase how the White Stripes are able to keep all of their music fresh and that is truly what makes this album a must own for any fan.

B001FB55I0|3.0|This movie was sub-par. It was just called Terminator to sell tickets. I didn't enjoy more than half of this movie. It was OK. But the other three where so much better. For those of you who scoffed at T3, I think after you saw this one you where probably more grateful for T3 than you had been. Let's hope, since they did take in a little bit of a profit, if you factor in the worldwide total, let's hope the next one is better. Let's hope they get better writers and a better director and a better soundtrack. I'd hate to see the Terminator franchise meet its own Judgement Day.<br /><br />I think my favorite part about this movie wasn't the movie itself but Christian Bale's on set tirade.<br /><br />I give this movie a 3/10. Sorry...<br />It grows on you a little but, mostly it disappoints.
B00361HV02|5.0|Black Rebel Motorcycle Club (BRMC) introduces its first full album unders its record label. Leah Shapiro has stepped in to fill the gap of drums (Jago out of seat). This maybe BRMC teasing with their discography as a cumulative influence snapshot.    BRMCs debut (BRMC) to music industry is one of R&R revival (with influence from JAMC). BRMC progressively teased with Psychadelia with a blues-timge in their sophmore release (Take Them On, On Your Own). BRMC almost ditched all electronics for the natural sounds in Howl (and 2nd Generation Bob Dylans shines off both Hayes and Levon-Been). BRMC went back to the heavy stuff on Baby 81.    Beat The Devils Tattoo is the cultivation of all previous album designs and a new drum backdrop to the mix. Each track brings a sharp undertone of a previous album, but was well distributed to avoid a pattern forming. Leah Shapiro really complimented into this band and hopefully as the new permanent drummer. This is also the longest album produced by them.    Definitely one of best albums of 2010 - but will remain underrecognized most likely.    BRMC will remain a low key band with a devout fan base.  I have immense respect for these guys (and lady) in producing some great music to avoid the present day typical \\"noise and yammering so-called music\\". While this is not their best work, its a good way of returning from a long hiadus and recovery.    Will see them April 9th - cannot wait.
B00003CXPD|5.0|What's not to like about this film. It is a masterpiece in every way. It shows that a boy can participate in something that is generally reserved for girls and not be a homosexual. In fact Billy's friend was there to show that Billy was not gay but that he accepted his friend for who he was. It showed that even the most intolerant of parents can be turned to support their child once they see how much it means to them and what talent they have, even in the worst situations. All the performances where great from the adults to the kids. Jamie Bell was a master a \\"Billy\\". I'm glad to see that he has become an A-list British actor and that he is getting so many starring roles. He deserves it, his acting is golden. 10/10 all around for this move, which in my book is a timeless classic with a great message, and a must watch for anyone with an once of tolerance.
0307269981|5.0|I love these books!  \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" is the second of the trilogy, the first being \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo.\\"  The writing is intelligent, intriguing, and talk about a page turner!  Whooo.  The main character, Lisbeth Salinger, is unlike any character you've ever met, and she's difficult to get to know, but strong and most admirable.  Each book is self-contained, full of mystery, with an exciting plot, strength of characters, and even includes details of Sweden you may never have read about.  Simply great reading, so different and so beautifully written.  I am heartbroken that the author did not live to receive his accolades for these spellbinding, adventurous and finely executed novels.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan most of my life. I can honestly say this movie was probably one of the best (If not the best) Treks I've ever seen! I can't wait for the DVD to come out. What's more I can't wait for the sequel! and it looks very likely that their will be a sequel. And with a movie this good, you can't expect anything other than the huge success it's enjoying!    The things that made it great where: The story was fantastic, people who weren't already fans of Trek could really get into it, it wasn't hard to understand, but it was still very intelligent. The music was superb! it gave it a very grand and exciting feeling! The effects where top of the line, and just plain brilliant! The humor gave it a more personal quality, so it didn't feel as stiff as it could have been. And the acting was top-notch. They really hit the nail on the head by picking the unknown Chris Pine to play James Kirk. Not only does he look like William Shatner did when he first started playing Kirk, but his acting was exceptional. And there was Zachary Quinto, he did the part of Spock so much justice, it's hard to see anyone else play him. And there was the surprise appearance of Leonard Nimoy (the original Spock) playing Older Spock. He really tied the story together. And not to forget, there was also the wonderful performances of Zoe Saldana, Anton Yelchin, John Cho, Karl Urban, and Eric Bana. Also the children that played Kid Kirk (Jimmy Bennett) and Kid Spock (Jacob Kogan) gave masterful performances for the short background story parts they where tasked with.    So that is why I say this movie was a triumph in every way! Not just as a Star Trek film but as any film! I give this movie a 10 out if 10! If they'd let me I'd give it a 20 out of 10!!!

B002YIHO7I|5.0|I had been hunting stores for anything new from Sade for a while.  I wasn't paying too much attention but I was surprised when this album finally came out that it had been so long since the last release.<br /><br />Some who love this artist may find this album breaks new ground.  What a concept!  An artist that keeps growing!<br /><br />It's good to see that artists can still control when, where and what they produce.  This album has much to recommend it to new and old Sade listeners!
0307454541|5.0|Stumbled a little over Swedish names, and it's not an easy plot to sort out, but this was a very satisfying read. Love the main characters, especially Lisbeth. Made the mistake of starting the book when I needed to get a lot of sleep, and did NOT get a lot of sleep -- stayed up reading till wee hours. Plan accordingly. Really curious what the movie-makers are going to do with this story. Loved listening to the audio version AND reading the book (audio great for the voices, book great for getting the names straight, which wasn't easy on the audio).
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I would have liked to have met Jane Austen, and I think she would find it entertaining that her books have lasted as long as they did.<br /><br />I won't review the book itself, but rather, the Kindle version of it. The book was free (amazing) and works splendidly across my non-Kindle devices, my iPod touch and my Blackberry. That way, I can sneak 10-15 mins worth of reading in on the train or bus without worrying about people making judgements about a man reading Austen.<br /><br />The test of a classic novel is whether or not you want to keep it handy and refer to it when you need inspiration, a solid read or just to get lost in a different world. Thanks to the Kindle edition of Pride and Prejudice, I can pretend I'm in the world of Mr. Darcy.
B00000JSJC|1.0|Didn't get it at all. Had such high hopes because of all the good reviews. The premise sounded intersting enough. The movit was just strange. It was dark. I mean literally dark, a lot of shadow and dark and had to make out what was going on all the time. Nodded off about 30 min into it.. and didn't feel like I missed a thing. Thank goodness I rented, if I had bought it based on reviews I'd be kicking myself in the arse right about now.
0307588335|5.0|I can readily admit that I am Main St rather than Wall St.  As such, I found Larry McDonald's book fascinating.  It provided an easy to understand look into the world of distressed debt, mortgage-backed securities and the ins-and-outs of the trading room floor.  I now have a much better understanding of the events that took place in late 2008 and how we got to where we are today.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has interest in Wall Street and the current state of the economy.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|When in spring 2007 Andrew Lloyd Webber announced that his next musical will be a follow-up to his most successful work, `The Phantom of the Opera', many eyebrows were knitted and almost instantly many online theatrical forums were swarmed with bashing and hostile comments, continuing well until today. Yet the composer took this project quite seriously and took his time, carefully recording and re-orchestrating the cast recording that we have in front of us today. By and large, the finished work presents itself as a worthy sequel to the 1986 smash musical hit.<br /><br />The plot has moved from the candle-illuminated Paris opera house ten years forward to 1907 and takes place at Coney Island, USA, famous for its fairground rides, resort beaches and freak shows in late 19th and early 20th century. This setting enabled ALW to mark his newest score with the stamp of that particular time.  The principal characters of the first show (The Phantom, Christine, Raoul, now her husband, Madame Giry and her daughter Meg, with one addition, that of a 10-year old Gustave, their son) are all back and their fates are interwoven once again. Some choices have yet again to be made and some revelations from the past come to light. Most of the characters show different traits this time around and The Phantom is now living comfortably on the surface as a human rather than mysteriously below things as it was in the first show, feeling free `to walk among men', as one of the show lyrics puts it.<br /><br />ALW composed a rich and diverse score for his latest work and it has all been recorded on this double CD. The setting has allowed him to compose in different fashions, from lushly orchestrated waltzes and classical ballads to ragtime, vaudeville and even progressive rock, the last one once again having the signature of the main male character. As this cast recording shows, the whole score is wonderfully orchestrated by ALW and his long-time associate David Cullen. My personal highlights include `The Coney Island Waltz' (the opening number), several soaring ballads (`Till I Hear You Sing'; `Beneath the Moonless Sky'; `Once Upon Another Time', the beautifully operatic `Love Never Dies'), a tour de force rock number `The Beauty Underneath' and delicate lyrical pieces such as `Beautiful' or Raoul's pondering of his relationship with Christine `Why does she love me?' The latter has a lovely delicate and discreet saxophone accompaniment just on the edges of the song. One should mention that only several music passages are quoted from the first show, them being in connection with similar choices the characters have again to make. There are also several very melodic ensemble numbers that achieve vocal harmony, such as `Dear Old Friend' and `Devil Takes the Hindmost'. In the end, the score comes across as the best ALW has composed in recent years.<br /><br />The lyrics by Glenn Slater tell the main plot with basic simplicity, which is enough, despite the fact some might yearn for craftsmanship of Tim Rice.<br /><br />The leads give one good performance. Ramin Karimloo, who played the main character in London for more than two years, is a powerful Phantom, boasting his vocal skills in the variety of songs this score presents. He has an equal partner in Sierra Boggess, Las Vegas's Christine of the first show, whose passion is best evident in her rendition of the title song. The supporting cast are also good in their roles: Joseph Millson's Raoul gives a touching performance in `Why Does She Love Me?, plus we have Summer Strallen playing Meg Giry and Sally Dexter, one of Britain's diverse actresses of stage and screen giving a voice to Madame Giry. A particular praise goes to young Charlie Manson however, whose angelic voice shines as he brings to life the young boy Gustave.<br /><br />This deluxe cast recording comes with 2 CDs capturing the whole score and a special DVD that shows the development process and features interviews with ALW, Glenn Slater, director Jack O'Brien, the cast and the rest of the production team. It also shows footage from the London press launch in October last year. The recording includes a booklet with photos of those involved in the project, a note from the composer and a full libretto, the latter always coming in handy for the first listen.<br /><br />To sum it up, `Love Never Dies' presents a commendable sequel to `The Phantom of the Opera' and reunites us once again with the characters so many people became accustomed with during many years `The Phantom of the Opera' has been playing on both sides of the pond.of the production team.

B000P0J06U|5.0|Expanding on his original Batman movie, Tim Burton returned with this sequel, and outdid himself.<br /><br />This time, Batman battles both the Penguin and Catwoman--along with disability and gender stereotypes lurking throughout the big city. Unlike the 1960's Adam West camp vehicle, these villians developed their mindsets from having being abused by the mainstream society.<br /><br />He was also born into a rich family, but having been abandoned into a sewer because of his disability was the precipitating factor which then-caused Oswald Cobblepot's transformation into the 'Penguin'. Department Store Mogul Max Shrek even notes that their economic status would have otherwise made Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot roommates in exclusive boarding schools which they were likely to have attended together, away from the other schools used by the 'general' public.<br /><br />But his 'odd' appearance was an innappropriate kind of special to his parents, who abandoned him after birth.<br /><br />And Selina Kyle assumed the 'Catwoman' after being harassed and killed by Shrek, a rich white male believing that the world owes him. Really timid and mousy, the pre-transformation Kyle let everybody walk all over her. Her only friend appeared to be her pet cat Miss Kity. So when Kyle died, it wasn't at all shocking that Miss Kitty and 'her friends' revived her. They gave her new life as a catwoman.<br /><br />However out of the two, Catwoman is the empathetic anti-hero. Aside from vengenace against the Shrek empire, she prowls the street actually trying to help other women who would otherwise themselves be abused by society. She is not the 'robber' type from the comics/tv series...etc.<br /><br />It is a shame that this Catwoman was not the one in the later spinoff because her Selina Kyle alter-ego comes off as likeable even in the 'changed' state. I really wanted more of her.<br /><br />I am wondering if this was intentional on Burton's part, but the screenplay came around the time of the Anita Hill hearings, when a secretary accused her boss of abuse, in a nationally-televised Senate hearing. Women were publically standing up for what they believed in.<br /><br />And it's so obvious that Bruce Wayne has romantic feelings for Kyle after the change. He's also a 'rich white millionare' but contrasting with Shreck and the other powerplayers of Gotham City, Wayne is another type of 'oddball'.<br /><br />This is because for how rich he is, he uses his material resources to instead think of other people and make the world a better place for all.<br /><br />Keaton's character continues demonstrating that power itself is not problematic, it is the usage and context of usage which is what ultimately makes somebody good or evil.<br /><br />I first saw this movie in junior high, but it's not a 'kiddie movie', instead a very sophisticated political critique of power and community.

B002T9H2LA|1.0|I would never have gone to see this movie had it not been at a friend's behest on a dull Friday night. I got what I expected, and therefore - I suppose - what I deserved.    The inexplicably misspelled \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is an adaptation of a comic book. This World War II tale concerns an American Lieutenant (Brad Pitt) leading a group of Jewish commandos to carry out reprisals against German soldiers in occupied France. A para-plot follows Shosanna (played by Melanie Laurent), the sole survivor of the Nazi massacre of her family, plotting to burn down a cinema while the entire German high command are in it. Her scheme overlaps with that of Pitt's.    This is a movie which has obvious bad guys and obvious good guys: Nazis on the one hand; and the Jewish/French resistance on the other. Yet the most revolting violence in the film (which occasioned gasps of revulsion from the audience I was in) is not perpetrated by the Nazis, but by the people whom we were supposed to be cheering for. It is a testament to how morally garbled this film is that the most memorable scene in it has the 'Bear Jew' (Eli Roth) literally smashing a German officer's skull to pieces with a baseball bat and triumphantly screaming out that he's \\"knocked it right out the f***ing park\\" while fellow Jews stand around laughing and applauding. Stop me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the kind of thing the Nazis used to do? It seems that Tarantino was in such a stampede to get some gore on screen that he didn't notice his heroes descending to the level of his villains. (The dispatched officer is never seen doing anything we might feel obliged to hate him for.) Using music and overlong suspense, the scene is stylised in the manner of a gunfight, yet the German soldier is unarmed and on his knees throughout. Is this how we want to remember the Nazis?    Eli Roth is a friend of Tarantino's, whose cinematic oeuvre has no theme, just recurring violence. Roth has confessed - without any irony - that when he floated the idea for his movie \\"Hostel\\", Tarantino exclaimed that this was the sickest thing he had ever heard, before adding: \\"You have *got* to make that film!\\" Roth went on to make Hostel II. When confronted with the movie's box office failure, he blamed it on video piracy. When confronted with the movie's critical failure, he explained that he only cares about fans, not critics. (Translation: I only listen to people who *like* my films.) It is therefore entire natural that Roth and Tarantino should club together to produce an immature, sweepingly self-indulgent gore-fest. Their partnership is a boyhood friendship formed between adults. Would you have picked this pair to produce a level-headed film about Jewish suffering under the Nazis?    Brad Pitt's performance was - to use an industry term - phoned in. But of course - for reasons outlined above - the line was bad before he even started, so it's not entirely his fault. It is very rare in even a mediocre motion picture for the audience to see the mask slip and suddenly be made aware that they are just looking at some guy acting. Yet I saw this happen about twice with Pitt in this film. Plainly he didn't believe in what he was doing. So why should we?    The opening scene - which centres bafflingly around milk - is far too long: and the suspense, though present, is overwrought. When Michael Cimino made the universally execrated \\"Heaven's Gate\\", the critic Danny Peary remarked that the director obviously thought that everything he had filmed was too precious to cut. Plainly Tarantino - who was once nicknamed \\"The Ego has Landed\\" by an Irish critic - suffers from the same kind of galloping self-regard.    There is one redeeming feature in this mess of a film. And that is the superb European cast. The supporting performers Melanie Laurent, Daniel Bruhl, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, August Diehl and Christoph Waltz (who took the Oscar) are all polyglot thesps who can really shine. So much so, in fact, that theycompletely outshine the American actors (and the myriad mistakes in the film itself). This is painfully symbolised in the scene in the cinema lobby in which Waltz encounters Pitt, who is trying to pass as an Italian while equipped with little more than 'Bonjourno'. As Waltz (who in real life can speak Italian, German, English and French) launches into a conversation with Kruger in fluent Italian, Pitt just has to stand there with a pained and stupid expression on his face. It is a symbol of all that has gone before: a world-famous but monoglot American movie star reduced to haplessness when surrounded by multi-lingual (and thus multi-talented) European unknowns. Fame truly counts for nought.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|When i put in this blu-ray DVD, i noticed \\"judder\\" when the camera panned from one direction to another on close-ups.  My TV has a 24p mode, allowing the blu-ray DVD to similate play at the frame rate of 24p, the same as we all see at the movies. So i was confused when i noticed the judder(a shaky, not-so-smooth look) on some scenes.  Now, for the 24p mode to work on my television, the film must be 1080p.  So i looked at the box and this product is 1080i, not 1080p.  I went to the store and found the same blu-ray for a lot more money than it's sold here on amazon, but it's 1080p at the stores!  So it looks like BBC makes this video in both 1080i and 1080p.  The one sold here is 1080i.  It still looks gorgeous, but if you have a tv with a 24p mode, then try to find one in 1080p.
0764207407|3.0|From BethanyHouse, I received a copy of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility Insight Edition. The Insight Edition has \\"trivia, notes, and inspiration to amplify this beloved classic.\\"<br /><br />This book has \\"helps\\" which include, but are not limited to, historical and cultural details and definitions, facts and tidbits from Austen's life that parallel or illuminate the novel, themes of faith, and my favorite: parts of the novel that just make us smile.<br /><br />I have tried *unsuccessfully* to read this entire book. Every time I begin, I get so sleepy I have to take a nap. I loved the movie (with Hugh Grant), so I'm just not sure what's up with me. At any rate,<br />Sense and Sensibility is about three sisters and their mother. The main focus is on two of the sisters: Elinor & Marianne Dashwood. Both young ladies experience love and heartbreak. Of course there are characters you can't help but dislike and the wording that is used to get their point across in a polite yet \\"no-reply-is-allowed\\" is humorous. The notes added into the margins of the book are great helps. This book also includes questions at the end for discussion.
B001OQCV2O|1.0|I chose 2012 as my first Blu-Ray movie when I got my new HD televisiona and Blu-Ray DVD player. The picture was outstanding and showed on Blu-Ray capibilities to the fullest. But the movie itself was an exercise in over the top movie making with some of the lamest dialogue ever written for the screen. After about an hour I kept looking at my watch wondering when this movie was going to end. Blue-Ray is great but bad movies are bad movies no matter what the format. Still if you need a DVD to amaze your friends this will do the trick.
0385483821|5.0|I came across Andy Grove's, Only the Paranoid Survive via Jack Covert and Todd Sattersten's, The 100 Best Business Books of All Time. And I now see why it made the list. Although it was written well over a decade ago, it offers timeless insight into topics ranging from effective top-to-bottom management styles to steadfast career maintenance. What I found most interesting was his unique insight into senior management's stubborn outlook on change. It still boggles the mind that those in leadership positions cling so tightly to their positions - even as their companies start to fail. I think it makes a great case for a life-long learning process that focuses on keeping a fresh young mind. Add this one to your library because by maintaining an honest premise, this book offers candid insight to anyone who plans to succeed in a management position and it does so in a clear, concise manner that doesn't bore you to death.
B002VJ0576|2.0|To be honest, I thought I had picked up the Downey version of SH.  I 'looked' at the case, but it didn't register this wasn't the recent theatrical release.  I was curious about the dinosaur raptor on the case picture (looks like it was lifted from Jurassic Park), but, since I hadn't seen the movie at the theater, figured it must be something I hadn't seen in the TV commercials.      Shame on Asylum for making a buck on fools like me - and shame on me for falling for it.    THIS IS NOT THE DOWNEY THEATRICAL RELEASE - THAT ONE WON'T BE AVAILABLE UNTIL 30 MARCH 2010.    And shame on Hastings for putting this in the \\"new release\\" section.    I've definitely been punked!    As for the movie itself - (maybe this is a spoiler but...) robotic dinosaurs and mechanical women in Victorian England!  Times were grand, but not this movie.  Guess it was okay until the raptor arrived, then my interest steadily declined.  The actor how played Holmes was utterly miscast - 'mousey' has been used to describe him and that's an accurate description.  Watson was the only decent character (and actor).    Pass on this one - wait until 30 MAR 2010.

B000G6BM00|5.0|The gap between ALIEN (1979) and ALIENS (1986) is the same gap between a very scary film of suspense and an infinitely scarier film whose suspense is heightened by slam-bang action.  Sigourney Weaver return as Ripley, who was the only survivor from the Nostromo, which was destroyed fighting only one alien creature. Weaver's Ripley was strong without being dominant.  After a fifty-seven year hibernation she awakens to return to Earth as a much subdued survivor.  For the first half of the movie, she is quiet, allowing others to grab the spotlight.  Paul Reiser, as Burke, is portrayed as one of many characters who manage to impress the audience with their unique personalities.  Burke is so weasely that you know not to trust one word he says.  Jeannette Goldstein as Marine private Vazquez is a tough as nails female recruit whose toughness is as external as Ripley's is internal.  Michael Biehn is effective as the goodlooking near romance that never got off the ground with Ripley, which dramatically speaking is probably just as well.<br /><br />When Ripley is persuaded to return to duty to rescue a planet of colonists threatened by the same vicious creatures from ALIEN, she knows what is in store, but a contingent of gungo ho marines callously dismisses her warnings in a manner that foreshadows Newt's comment that Ripley's marines won't make any difference. There is a great deal of witty dialogue among the marines that is strangely appropriate for each occasion, much of which has entered the lexicon of movie dialogue immortality.  As soon as Ripley finds Newt (Carrie Henn), the film takes on a series of subtexts that richly add to rather than distract from audience involvement.  Ripley's maternal instincts kick in and play off surprisingly well in a daring move made by director James Cameron.  The Queen Alien is herself a mother and the scene in the brood creche connects two mothers determined to protect their offspring even at the cost of their own lives.  When Ripley yells at the Queen, \\"Get away from her you bitch!\\" the lines of feminine battle are irrevocably set and the audience, which has just emerged from numerous scenes of claustrophobic nerve-jangling action, is now ready for a more primal battle.  What emerges from a more than 150 minute film is one that could not have been more effective in less time.  ALIENS is the very nearly perfect blend of action, suspense, powerful acting, and witty dialogue, all of which add up to a movie that was richly deserving of the various awards it either won or for which it was nominated.the Queen, \\"Get away from her you bitch!\\" the lines of feminine battle are irrevocably set and the audience, which has just emerged from numerous scenes of claustrophobic nerve-jangling action, is now ready for a more primal battle.

0882709194|1.0|In a short 50 pages Ray Comfort has committed so many logically fallacies and made so many stupid arguments that it's hard to know where to begin when offering a critique of what he says.    In his biography of Darwin, Comfort usually sticks to the known facts, but he often highlights certain facts or misrepresents reality for apparent reasons. For example, he mentions (twice) how Darwin's father thought Darwin to be a terrible student. He tells that Darwin's original diagram of the evolutionary tree had the words \\"I think\\" beneath it. He includes a quote from Darwin that confessing evolution is \\"like confessing a murder.\\" He seems to indicate that Darwin developed his theory, in part, through \\"experimentation in his garden and the countryside around Down House.\\" This is not inaccurate, but it is a misleading and condescending portrayal. Within the biography, Comfort decides that God is needed so when speaking of Darwin's death he says that Darwin \\"went to make his Maker\\" and the last word of Comfort's short biography is \\"clergy\\" for clergy were indeed at Darwin's funeral. (Take that atheists!)    As for the rest of the introduction... Comfort first makes an argument by false analogy (ink spilling on to pages to make a coherent book is analogous to DNA being randomly sorted to make the genome of on organism) He then waves around two God-believers, Anthony Flew and Francis Collins. (Are you the reader, smarter than these two men? Are you? Are you?) Comfort conveniently omits that both these men reject creationism and intelligent design.     He then dismisses the fact that chimps and humans have 96% the same DNA. (He makes much of the fact that original estimates as to the level of similarity used to be around 98-99% before the genomes of both were compared.) Next he brings out the same old creationist refrains about missing links, evolutionary hoaxes, and not enough fossils. He quotes Richard Leaky saying there is \\"nothing found to truthfully purport as a transitional species to man.\\" Never mind that plenty of fossils have been found since 1990 and the very important fact that the theory of evolution does not need ANY fossils to be defended. It's simply fortunate that fossilization, as a process, does happen.    He goes into a 5 page diatribe about hearts. Which came first, blood, or the circulatory system? Instead of going back to the earliest stages of the evolution of circulatory systems, Comfort skips straight to the circulatory systems of fish. If he had been honest, he would have looked at worms that have a circulatory system that is basically a simple muscular tube which squeezes rhythmically to move blood-like liquid.    He repeats the usual stuff about eyes and vestigial organs. This man doesn't realize that although vestigial organs can serve some function for an organism (a penguin's \\"wings\\" being used for swimming) they are still vestigial because they are not performing the task that the organ was originally used for in an ancestor.    Next in the book. Shocking revelation: Darin was a sexist and racist. Think that sexism and racism existed before Darwin's theory? Nope, it all started then in 1869. To drive the point home he has several pages of quotes from Hitler. *yawns    He then misquotes Francis Crick and Dawkins to make it look like these two men are trying desperately hard to ignore the design they see all around them.     Quick note on the the pictures that Comfort chose to include. Some are of Darwin's life and are normal enough, but Comfort thinks the joke of Darwin portrayed as a monkey in late 19th century cartoons is so funny that he includes no less than four of these depictions. Really classy Comfort.    He then throws in his appeal to be saved. (By the way, he ruins the ending of the movie UP in his intro. Not nice.) Most of it is his standard spiel. You've broken the 10 commandments. Be saved! Christianity is better than those other silly religions. Be saved! Don't ask for proof; that's just silly.Be saved!     I'll end with this. Comfort has the startling pretentious audacity to include this story: \\"On February 24, 2005, a nine-year-old girl was reported missing from her home in Homosassa,Florida. Three weeks  later, police discovered that she had been kidnapped, brutally raped, and then buried alive. Little Jessica Lunsford was found tied up, in a kneeling position, clutching a stuffed toy.\\" Why does Comfort include this story that would make any decent person furious? Because he wants to let you know that God, too, is very furious that this took place. Then he makes this point: \\"The fury of Almighty God against evil is evidence of His goodness. If He wasn't angered, He wouldn't be good.\\" My pulse quickened as I read that. It was the one time in the intro that I wasn't amused by Comfort; I was furious. What's even more sickening then Comfort's twisted logic on that point, is that the reason that he includes the story is to indicate that God is VERY angry not just at child rape and murder. He's also VERY angry when you, a 20-year-old-male look at a woman in the wrong way. He's VERY angry when you say \\"God damn it.\\" Yes, dear reader, I know child rape gets you angry, but just remember that God is just as angry with child rape as He is with lust, or envy, or the belief in evolution...
B00004RF83|4.0|Excellent film when I first saw it in 1963 and still valid today. There are two versions of the movie on this DVD. One version is the standard film you expect. The other version adds a wonderful behind-the-scenes commentary by director John Frankenheimer as he watches the movie with you. Each scene tells a story and each word of dialog is spoken for a reason. The fact that his film is shot in black and white only enhances its impact.
B000UEA5EW|5.0|The 1981 Presidio hard cover edition is a very sturdy binding of this book. My copy has held up well to nearly 19 years of being stuffed into suitcases and helmet bags, dropped, dog eared and underlined. Early in its life I lent it to a number of people in my squadron and later to my children, so who knows what abuse it has suffered. It appears to be printed on high quality paper and is barely discolored despite its hard usage. In my opinion it is a very good buy if you can find a copy.

B00127RAJY|5.0|August of 2009 I had a 7 in tumor removed from the center of my spinal cord. It ran from the base of my brain to the center of my shoulder blades.

Due to my reduced mobility the pounds have poured on, and needless to say I have become very unhappy with myself.<br />I have been an avid fan of Jillian Michaels, watching Biggest Loser season after season. When I heard about the 30 Day Shred I figured I'd give it a try. If the folks on the show could do the workouts with Jillian hours on end then I most certainly could do 25 minutes a day!<br />Let me say that this is DEFINITELY an intense workout! Day 1 & 2 had me cursing Jillian and wishing I had never heard of her before. I had to lay off on day 3, my husband insisted as I could barely move. He had to remind me of all my body had been through and that I'm not the average person. I went right back to it the next day, and stuck right with it.<br />While I have had to modify a few things in the routine to meet my disabilities, I can feel my strength and endurance returning. At a time where I was starting to be resigned to the fact that I may never be my old self again, Jillian's tough, no-nonsense approach has brought back my spirit and fight.<br />For this I wish to thank Jillian Michaels and The 30 Day Shred. While it's not an easy workout, if I can do it, anyone can! There are no excuses!

You have put to words all of the thoughts and feelings that I have had in my experiences as a business woman.

B0000026UV|5.0|I first bought this album back in the 90's and had to replace it recently such was the amount of wear it got. This is more than just suprememly talented musicians having fun with what they do best; it is a celebration of friendship and the power of music to affect our mood and demeanor. I defy anyone to listen to this album and not feel (in turn)happiness, joy, melancholy and admiration.    Mark Knopfler is a giant of a guitarist. His musical range and ability seems without limit. I swear the guy acould drag a chair across a wood floor and make the ensuing squeak sound musical. He is head and shoulders above the overwhelming majority of one trick pony rock guitarists. He's the real deal. Am I the only one who hears the occasional Django punctuations in his acoustic playing?    As for the late great Chet, it has all been said before and I have no idea where to start save to use a much over used word in it's proper context: Genius. Check out his biography if you don't believe me. A lovely guy too, and not the least conceited. I saw him on an award show in Nashville many years ago. Someone gave him a big compliment onstage and he brushed it aside. The person he was talking to said \\"Chet, don't be so modest\\". Chet said. \\"Well... I've got a lot to be modest about\\".    Beat that for charm.    I think Mark should invite another great country player to make \\"Neck and Neck II\\". A guy who is as good as any and hails from the UK also. Mark, get on the phone and call Albert Lee right away!    If you love music, and love it so much you don't need gimmicks, fashion or wacky hair cuts, buy this wonderful and historic recording.
B0017I0KVI|5.0|I've always found Mr. Knightley to be an appealing character, but it's not necessarily easy to make a nice person interesting.  Written from Knightley's perspective on the events of Jane Austen's _Emma_, Amanda Grange does a fine job of filling in our knowledge of the character and what his life would be like, and particularly of letting us hear his view on pivotal scenes from the original novel; further, the author masterfully writes the gradual realization by Knightley that he loves Emma.  Nice writing, believable.  Perhaps not as elegant as the source material, but what is?  I will read other books by this author.
B0035V35PI|5.0|I don't write many reviews and i've never written a review about a movie, but this movie has motivated me to write my thoughts on why its the best ninja movie i've ever seen.     My Review: In my opinion this film is as good as it gets. This movie is non-stop action from the opening sequence through the end. The only thing i have to warn others about is the amount of gore present in the film. Its extremely graphic. But if you can stomache the blood you'll be rewarded with one of the best fight films to ever grace your television. The sound effects are phenominal and if you don't already own a surround system then this is the perfect time to get your home theater up to par and invest in some hardware, you won't regret it. The sounds from swords, shirukins, fighting action, etc will blow your mind. This film offers a level of immersion i have never experienced in a martial arts film. In fact i don't think i'm going too far by saying this is the single best martial arts/ninja movie of all time. I'm trying to keep this review short so i'll end by saying if you have not experienced this film yet you are just cheating yourself of one of the best films of all time.
B0027CSNBM|5.0|Personally, I was excited to see something interesting while I waited for the 5th Percy Jackson book to come out, but I'm also fairly cynical about what to expect.  This inexpensive volume was a pleasant surprise, with three decent short stories, goofy interviews with characters, a map of Camp Half-Blood, a color insert section with pictures and profiles of the main characters, a crossword puzzle, word search and chart of the Olympian gods.  I thought this was a fun treasure trove of odd materials -- quite interesting and enjoyable.

B00337KM2S|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />With the plague of 'corporate downsizing' now reaching its zenith, such a social phenomenon is bound to come to the attention of Hollywood's top name producers. Hence, Jason Reitman, son of famous Hollywood producer/director Ivan Reitman, has been given the reins to address this very issue. It also helps to have heart-throb George Clooney in the role of corporate down-sizer Ryan Bingham, who flies around the country as a sort of 'hired gun', informing various downsized employees that their services are no longer required.<br /><br />Soon a young upstart, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), comes up with the brilliant idea of firing employees via a computer video linkup. One wonders why Ryan's company hadn't embraced this method years before, since obviously it is much more cost effective. And it's also hard to believe that a new employee such as Natalie, who is just out of school, would be the one introducing the new prototype as these video linkups (as just pointed out) have not only been around for quite some time but it's more likely a more experienced person would probably be responsible for developing or customizing it.<br /><br />Somehow Ryan convinces his boss that 'face-to-face' firings still are much more preferable to firings via computer and that Natalie needs to understand the value of the 'human touch'. Ryan's boss puts the video project on hold and allows Ryan to keep jetting about firing people in person as long as Natalie accompanies him. This of course allows 'Up in the Air' to become something of a 'buddy' picture with Ryan and Natalie 'duking it out' over the nature of relationships. When Natalie finds out that Ryan has been having a casual affair with Alex, who is he is constantly meeting up with while on the road, she castigates him for not getting involved. Let me add that Natalie only becomes emotional over this issue after she has been dumped by her own boyfriend (via text message). For the most part, she is a one-note cold fish who soon learns the delicate art of firing people face to face, under Ryan's tutelage.<br /><br />Not much happens during the 'second act' of 'Up in the Air'. Director Reitman spends too much time presenting cameos of real-life people recreating their reactions to the news that they've been downsized. Was it necessary to 'pad' the film with these cameos? Basically one minute of the fired employees would have been enough to convey the despair of these hapless people. There are additional repetitious scenes with Ryan, while moonlighting as a motivational speaker, utilizing a backpack to illustrate his 'life philosophy' to an audience of self-help junkies at various hotel conference rooms. Reitman wastes additional time with a scene where the three principals attend a corporate party, culminating with a 'heart-to-heart' talk between Alex and Ryan on a corporate yacht.<br /><br />You would think that the big 'Act Two Climax' would have something to do with the relationship between Ryan, Alex and Natalie, but it doesn't. Instead, there's an awkward subplot that pops up involving Ryan's sister's fianc&eacute; who gets cold feet just before he's about to get married. Ryan is called in by his other sister and uses his 'motivational speaker' skills to convince the errant husband-to-be, to go ahead with the wedding--which of course he does and the couple live happily ever after.<br /><br />The wrap up of Act Three is decidedly a downer--and thoroughly unconvincing to boot. Despite the fact that Alex attends Ryan's sister's wedding and seemingly is now ready to become more involved with him, it just doesn't turn out that way. After giving up his motivational speaker gig, Ryan somehow finds Alex's home address and knocks on her door--only to discover that she is a married woman. Since Alex only wanted a casual relationship, it would have been much easier for her to simply tell Ryan that she was married and there would have been no hard feelings. But since the film's screenwriter was desperate to create some kind of drama (and there is so little of it in this film), we're treated to the unlikely scenario of Ryan being deflated when he discovers the true nature of Alex's marital status. As for Natalie, she quits the company after learning that one of the downsized employees that she had fired, killed herself. It appears that both Ryan and Natalie did not heed this particular employee's pronouncement while on one of their firing jaunts, as the woman did indeed explicitly state that she was going to jump off a bridge. Inexplicably, Ryan's boss puts the computer video link program on hold despite the fact that the communication between Ryan and Natalie and this particular employee, took place face to face!<br /><br />Up in the Air is a slow-moving 'dramedy' with an underdeveloped plot. While it's a very nice-looking film, the actors can do very little with their parts due to the weak script. Clooney basically plays himself (as he usually does) and offers up an only serviceable performance. On the basis of director Reitman's last two films ('Juno' preceded 'Up in the Air'), it's likely we'll be seeing uninspired, mediocre films from him in the future.create some kind of drama (and there is so little of it in this film), we're treated to the unlikely scenario of Ryan being deflated when he discovers the true nature of Alex's marital status.

Despite its overt campiness and obvious D&D campaign structure,   the story has a lot of imagination, is a lot of fun, and never gets   pretentious or bogged down by its own \\"world building\\" mythos.

B0034JKZ86|3.0|OK, who remembers outstanding Disney animated films?  I sure do.  This last decade Disney dropped the ball after they reclaimed their standards in the late 1980's.    If it had not been for the Pixar films the last decade would have been a failure.      This film was much talked about.  Then, underperformed at the box office.    Anyone remember good Disney characters?  How about memorable Disney music with their films?  Gone are the days.    The film is good BUT not up to the old Disney standards.  Some humor.  NOT enough to carry the film.  In my opinion they went back to the standard of 1996's  The Hunchback of Notredame which just was OK.  Watchable but not outstanding.  Not a film you look forward to watch again nor do you talk about.    Copied, used ideas.    Same here.  A few minor characters like Louis the alligator.  No Disney songs you will remember.  Notice no Oscar wins for Disney music in years.   Jazz.      Good looking animation is a plus.    Now, Disney has just gone cheap in their DVD releases.    Pushing or better said shoving blu ray down everyone's throats.  The DVD was like original DVD releases after the format came out in the late 1990's.    A plain Jane silver disc.  WHERE is artwork from the film on it?  No chapter search list.  NO good extras.  Just plain cheap.  DISNEY, TAKE NOTE, NOT EVERYONE IS SWITCH TO MORE EXPENSIVE BLU RAY.  I am sure NOT.  I want to see extras on Disney DVD's.  Not you have to spend a lot more money to get a blu ray or blu ray combo pack just to get any extras of worth.      Just a watchable animated film.  You will not be talking about it or remembering the songs.

There's always a scene or two that will leave you puzzled and make you wonder why it was even necessary but I guess that's part of their creative process in establishing their setting. The intro to this movie had nothing to do with the rest, but I was still fascinated by it.<br /><br />It stars Michael Stuhlbarg as Larry Gopnik, a Jewish man facing a lot of escalating problems that stack up as the movie goes on. His brother played by Richard Kind is a nuisance who mooches off him, sleeps on the couch, and gets into trouble with the law. His wife played by Sari Lennick wants a divorce and has already picked out someone to remarry played by Fred Melamed. His son is getting ready for his barmitzvah but also owes a pot dealer money. Problem after problem and it seems like no one really listens or has good advice for him. Michael Stuhlbarg really sells us the persona of a good man, trying sooo hard to do the right thing, be a good person and doesn't consider for a moment getting really upset with his wife or kicking his brother out. He is so earnest and so desperate (and so funny) in this dark comedy.<br /><br />This wouldn't work without the other supporting cast members delving deeply into the Jewish culture for us to get a sense of this society in the 1960s. Absolutely fabulous performances by Sari Lennick and Fred Melamed in particular. Also Richard Kind is still the king of playing that guy, that mooch of a guy that's always there and you have a hard time saying no to.<br /><br />I loved the set up, the music, the drama, the darkness, the off-the-wall stories and comic moments, the suspense, and the surprise dream sequences (one of which got me GOOD, I jumped!). The ending will have you scratching your head and wishing for more. I highly recommend this movie if you are into dark comedy, Jewish movies, and/or Coen brother movies.music, the drama, the darkness, the off-the-wall stories and comic moments, the suspense, and the surprise dream sequences (one of which got me GOOD, I jumped!).

B002RVZV9U|5.0|I enjoyed this video mostly because Jimmy Page was featured. When I first heard about this production and of what guitarists it featured, I didn't understand how either The Edge or Jack White could stand on a stage next to Jimmy. I wish Paul Gilbert, Jake E. Lee, Doug Aldrich, Gary Moore, Audley Freed, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, David Gilmour, Eric Johnson, Eddie Van Halen (if he could stay clean) or any number of other true guitarists for the guitarist community could have been featured rather than Edge or Jack. Don't get me wrong; I like U2's music and appreciate the unique quality of The Edge's style but his playing could never be considered in the same league as that of Pagey. For the most part, I enjoyed Edge's parts in this film, particularly his modesty in afirming that his array of effects has much to do with his sound. Seeing he and Mr. White react to Jimmy whipping out a couple of timeless Zeppelin riffs was very cool and I appreciate the subtle respect paid to JP by both of these professional musicians. I appreciated Jack White as an artist a great deal more after seeing this film. Anyone in today's creative vacuum who has the guts to revisit late 60s to 70s blues guitar style gets at least some of my attention. It's pretty hard to come up with new creative techniques on guitar today but this film features a couple of Jack's creative 'inventions' that really impressed me. Quotes by all three musicians are thoughtful and encouraged me as a guitarist to enjoy the music creating experience for what it is at the moment and for what it does for it's creators emotionally. Led Zep received a great deal of criticism, especially with the first 4 albums and this was revisited. During different segments, the 3 play each other's music together and seem to have a good time with it. Each tells what his influences were when they were young and much of it was surprizing to me. If you are a fan of late 60's, 70s or 80s rock, any blues based rock or of the bands represented by any of these guitarists, you'll want to own this disk. I rented it first only because it appeared at the rental store when I had a free rental coming to me. Even after watching it twice, I had to buy it to keep in my library. I thank each of these musicians and those like them who enrich our lives with the sharing of thier talent and compositional talent.any of these guitarists, you'll want to own this disk.

B002UNMW7O|1.0|In honor of St. Patrick's Day yesterday, I decided to finally view this movie to find out if it had much in common with its successful cult classic predecessor. This movie made me almost forget everything I enjoyed about the original. If you are an incredibly devoted Boondock Saints fan, you'll probably love this movie because of all the throwback themes of the brothers screwing up on the way to their missions and the willingness of bad guys to stay kneeling in one spot while they are prayed at before being executed.<br /><br />For the more casual observer, this is one of the most ridiculous over-the-top B movies I've seen in a long time. So much that I had to look up and confirm that yes, this movie was also written and directed by Troy Duffy, the same man who did the first one.  Only 8 years have passed in movie time, but 10 years have passed in real life. Connor and Murphy are still played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, but they look much older now! The stuff they got away with looking like kids just doesn't play as well now that they are in their 40s! There's just no hiding how weathered they look. When you're making big mistakes at their age, they just look incompetent and it isn't as much fun when it feels so sad.<br /><br />Unique and honest moments in the first film that became quotable and memorable as a result did not happen here. So much felt forced, profanity for profanity's sake led to a trio of cops sounding more like the Three Stooges than law enforcement. They added a Mexican to their team complete with lots of stereotyping and his eyes bug out of his head so badly, I guess he must be the comic relief. But to what? The whole thing feels like a comedy, the drama almost never gets over.<br /><br />Let's start with the beginning. The brothers are shepherding on a sheep farm in Ireland with their father and have grown almost Moses-like hair in matching brown.  Wow. After a copycat kills a priest in the same style the Saints did, they feel the need to go to America to confront them. This results in a lot of dead people.<br /><br />Willem DaFoe's successor is FBI Special Agent Eunice Bloom played by Julie Benz whom you might remember as Darla from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel TV Series. A lot has changed in her appearance but she shows up with a saucy Southern accent to prove how dumb (as if we needed the help, they can barely form sentences) the Three Stooges of law enforcement are by explaining the crime scenes as DaFoe once did. She lacks his charm and charisma and comes off as you-can't-touch-me diva with an attitude so hard-as-nails that you never really warm to her character. Her accent does not make her seem more intelligent, just saucy. But I'm sure guys will warm to something else about her like the long legs and insane heels made for street walking.<br /><br />The movie gets a little better when their father joins in played by Billy Connolly shows up to be dramatic with an old foe. The flashbacks of his youth don't add very much to the story and when you find out the big reason behind all this blood and violence, you'll probably feel pretty annoyed as I was.<br /><br />The action feels similar, that whole disorganized randomness that results in precision headshots and criminals willing to hold still and wait for their death.<br /><br />Overall, this movie feels very disappointing and takes away from the greatness of the original by association. I really need to go rent the first one again to remind myself what I liked because this felt so wrong.o confront them. This results in a lot of dead people.

B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zep 3 is an under-rated classic. Immigrant Song rocks, Friends and Gallows Pole are folksy and Celebration Day and Out on the Tiles are terrific rockers. Since I've Been Loving You has one of the best guitar solos Page ever recorded. After LZ 1 and 2, no one was expecting something like 3, with it's acoustic sensibilities. But Zep needed to show the world that they weren't one trick ponies and could do something different. Often overlooked, but that's a mistake. This is an excellent album.
B001UV4XWY|3.0|\\"The Box\\" was written and directed by Richard Kelly, director of \\"Donnie Darko\\" and \\"Southland Tales\\" based on a short story called \\"Button, Button\\" by Richard Matheson which also inspired an episode of the Twilight Zone. This movie stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as a couple chosen for a social experiment - whether if given the opportunity to be given a million dollars they will push a button on this box, knowing that the action will result in the death of someone else.<br /><br />Normally I would be really into a psychological thriller like this, especially from the same guy as \\"Donnie Darko\\". The premise is intriguing and could really get a lot of discussion going on who is conducting the experiment and why, but I felt this movie actually gave too many answers away. It was derailed and fell into a realm of weirdness that was very disappointing to watch.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz as a young mother/teacher with a deformed foot was sometimes heartbreaking to watch as she struggled day to day and at other times surprisingly monotone as she delivered her lines. Granted some were very simple lines and could have been jazzed up a bit but you would think someone with her experience could play a little more with subtext in that situation. James Marsden was endearing for his obvious love of his wife but it seemed like he was very slow to react in bizarre situations.<br /><br />Frank Langella played the mysterious Mr. Steward (haha, get it?) who delivers the box to the couple and answers some of their questions and leaves others a mystery. He has a deformity of the face from being struck by lightning. I think his acting was creepy, mysterious, properly monotone and always acting like a gentleman even when presenting a macabre choice. However, too much was given away about his origins and who he was.<br /><br />This story clearly works better in the short version. By stretching it out, they invented many additional angles with NSA, Langley, NASA, family, school, and neighborhoods and it was a lot to juggle. The bigger the conspiracy got, the smaller it got too with the possibilities of what it could mean. There was a lot of waiting for things to happen and too much drawing out of scenes meant for suspense but not achieving it entirely. A few good moments does not a screen gem make! An hour or less would have done this one just fine. If I didn't already like this genre of film, I would have thought less of it so the average person probably wouldn't like it much.gle.

0894803123|5.0|First, the \\"warning\\": This book was written over 23 years ago, prior to all the health scares about using RAW EGGS. If this is the deal breaker for you, before you buy this book, check your markets to see if they sell pasteurized eggs such as Davidson's or another brand. IF you are concerned about this factor and IF you've found safe eggs, THEN buy this book. If you can't be bothered, then move on and don't whine about the raw eggs!<br /><br />Now, on to the review: I've owned this book for 23 years and have worked my way through every single recipe, many times over. Chatty, illustrated in the style of it's time (very Peter Max or Moosewood-ish), it is a user-friendly 1st owners guide to making incredible ice creams, sorbets, sundaes, brownies and other delights. It's fun to read about the beginnings, literally, of both Ben & Jerry, their various metamorphosises along the way to creating their company. The ingredients called for are very common and easily found such as strawberries, plums, Oreos, etc. The entire book is in colour and charmingly illustrated, making it easy to follow directions and not become bored by the whole experience.<br /><br />If you just want a basic, simple, easy book that has kid and adult friendly recipes, then THIS is the one for you! If you grow beyond this book, then I highly recommend Mathew Klein's \\"The Joy of Ice Cream\\", which has more exotic and adult flavours such as Chocolate Almond Brittle and Buttermilk Peach. That one came out in 1985 and is my second ice cream companion.
B001QOGYFO|2.0|\\"Whiteout\\" is directed by Dominic Sena based on a graphic novel by Greg Rucka and Steve Lieber and adapted by four other people. In all this mess, it is clear that the suspense and energy of the original version was lost along the way leaving us with a very cold, seemingly unoriginal movie.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale stars as Carrie Stetko, a U.S. Marshal stationed at Antarctica for some reason. A murder is discovered shortly before six months of darkness oncoming and no one will be able to leave. She has an obligatory shower scene where you get to see a lot of skin before she bundles up in heavy sweaters and parkas for the other 130 minutes.<br /><br />Everything that was scary and suspenseful about this idea in \\"30 Days of Night\\" failed to be captured here. People are so hindered by the wind and snow that they can barely attack each other. They are so bundled up, you can't tell who is the good guy and who is the bad guy while they badly fight each other. Inbetween short bursts of action, there is a considerable amount of down time where characters talk quietly to each other about their feelings and flashbacks. I really didn't feel that the set up for WHY Carrie was in Antarctica was really so important that it overshadowed the current crime! There's a murder and I don't get as much of a sense of urgency to finding the killer. It might determine whether they will be stuck in this cold dark place all winter and I feel like people drag their feet a little.<br /><br />Action! Drag, drag, drag. Skirmish! Drag, drag, drag, drag. Surgery! Drag, drag, drag. Get my point?<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale is a pretty girl, but she is much better suited for the Underworld movies and general rom-coms. I just don't see her as a marshal. She just doesn't look like she can kick butt unless we know she has supernatural powers. She might have abs but she's still so skinny she looks like she could be broken in half. She is NOT Michelle Rodriguez on the bad-ass girl scale.<br /><br />Only pick up this thriller as a rental if almost all other new releases are gone already. And you'd be better off with \\"30 Days of Night\\" if you want to experience the graphic novel feel, the scary coldness of that type of climate, and have suspense and action worth watching!most all other new releases are gone already.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|Touching true story.I wish it was set in real time (1920's) and keeping the story in its origin (Japan). Never the less,beautifully directed and moving performance by Richard Gere and Hachico.Too bad Americanizing it and making it more current still did not put in in more theaters. Interesting added behind the scenes footage too.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|This is a nice piece of rom-com fluff at the end of a hard day. As long as you try not to read too much into it. \\"The Proposal\\" was directed by Anne Fletcher who also directed \\"27 Dresses\\", a rom-com with cute possibilities but little substance. This movie starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds was an improvement. Sandra Bullock plays Margaret Tate, a hard-nosed book editor Canadian about to be deported who demands her assistant, Andrew Paxton played by Reynolds to marry her. To prove their relationship, they have to go on a weekend with the Paxton family in Alaska where it gets a little silly.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock always plays a sweetheart and has a Lucille Ball-like clumsiness in her comic arsenal. I fully believed her emotional journey in this movie, but the tough part would have to be believing her being the big bad heartless boss. She was forthright and stern, but she was not exactly Meryl Streep from The Devil Wears Prada and I think that's where she needed to go to really complete that change well.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds is usually an actor I detest because 90% of his movies, he plays someone who's a big jerk. He's great at smart ass line delivery but I could never feel for him in those because it just wasn't genuine enough. This movie was a BIG change and he came off as a sweetheart. He had the balls to stand up to his dad about not joining the family business and pursuing his dreams as a writer and editor. This was an older, more mature Ryan Reynolds and I hope this turn in his career keeps up because if it does, I'll be happy to watch many more films from him in the future.<br /><br />Betty White was hilarious as Grandma Annie. A scene between her and Sandra Bullock doing some sort of tribal dance in the woods was very strange and occasionally awkward but I had to let it go and laugh since Bullock was singing about \\"sweat drip down my balls, all you *itches crawl!\\" and freak-dancing. Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen were very good ensemble members playing Andrew Paxton's parents.<br /><br />My favorite off the wall cameo was from Oscar Nunez from The Office. He apparently works every job in this small town - store clerk, minister, exotic dancer. His accent was killing me since he has none in The Office and dancing around with very little clothes.....I just about died laughing because it's such a change from his straight-laced gay accountant character on TV.<br /><br />So was the writing brilliant? Heck no. The ending of course shouldn't make any sense by any stretch of the imagination in real life. Basically you had a premise, a hook, to bring the audience in and then you have to make it play out somehow. There are lots of funny scenes linked together with a fluffy ending and it's a no-work light movie that will amuse you and relax you at the end of the day. For that, it serves its purpose well. It should not be winning any awards, but hopefully it helps the careers of the lead actors.ton's parents.    My favorite off the wall cameo was from Oscar Nunez from The Office.

1400052173|5.0|This is the most thoroughly captivating book I've read in a long time. Whether you are slightly interested in science or love science (and great science writing), this book is for you. The story is real and urgent, and demands thoughtful engagement from its readers, so I would strongly suggest waiting to pick it up until you have a few hours to devote to it -- once you start it, you may find it very difficult to divert your attention to anything else for a while!
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Michael Haneke, director of Cache, now brings us an equally disturbing, tension-filled story told entirely in beautiful black and white cinematography, \\"The White Ribbon.\\" Taking place in pre-WWI in a small Protestant German village, religion and fear take their toll on the villagers as mysterious events and \\"accidents\\" take place around their peaceful town. The mystery of who might be behind it grows stronger every day and perplexes everyone. The most disturbing part is the fact that it seems children might be the source of the evil. I will be giving a bit more synopsis than I normally would, but I think it's important to properly understand the story.<br /><br />This is not a film for the average movie-goer because it moves slowly, it's quiet, there are subtitles, it's not in color, it's cranked full of symbolism, and let's not forget it's two and a half hours long. However, if you are a film buff and like artsy stuff as well, this is your cup of tea.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Haneke's strong build of suspense throughout the film. For an R-rated film, there is not a lot of on screen violence. Taking place off screen, you are left to imagine the consequences most of the time and that can be scarier still. Walking around slowly in this old creaky houses waiting for something to happen will keep you alert and interested and the time passes by quicker than you'd think.<br /><br />This is a strong patriarchal culture. Father sets down the rules and the punishments for even the smallest of misbehavior and the degree of intensity and psychological damage being inflicted doesn't leave a lot of room for surprise that this could have been part of the generation of children who grew up to be Nazis. The children test their boundaries to see what they can get away with and the more they get away with, the easier greater crimes seem to be. Not that the adults are any better! The adults' infractions and bad qualities are laid out for the audience and all members of this society are concerned with proper punishment above all else.<br /><br />The actual \\"white ribbon\\" is a punishment itself to be worn by the pastor's children after they act up. The white color is to remind them of the innocence and purity they should be seeking in their everyday lives and they have to wear them for the world to see.<br /><br />The story is presented to us over a long period of time by a narrator who is schoolteacher to the children. His subplot also lends the film its only beacon of shining light as he falls in love with a nanny and attempts to woo her.<br /><br />The children in this film seem mature beyond their years, even the youngest ones. They handle the heavy themes with faces of innocence that conceal the malice that might lay behind them.<br /><br />This film had the best/worst break-up scene ever. This man laid out the most derogatory base insults upon this woman in such a matter-of-fact matter and it was so utterly raw and scathing, it made my jaw drop.<br /><br />This is the best foreign language film I've seen in a long time and one of the best movies I've seen this year so far (even though it was released in 2009, it is only just now coming to theaters in my area). It has already won some awards and is up for Best Foreign Language Picture for the Oscars. Not for everyone, but a good hearty meal of a film to the right audience.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Features:<br /><br />There is a making of the film feature. They looked at around 7,000 children over the course of six months in casting the ten main child roles. Any children that were second choices ended up filling up the background in classroom and church scenes. There is some amazing audition and rehearsal footage of the children running through certain scenes and fascinating to see how normal and modern they look since their costumes and manner fit the time period so well that one could have believed they were just snatched through a time rip! Many of the adult actors were fascinated with the story and fought to get into this project. Not enough weathered-looking people could be found locally so the search went out to places like Romania where people had it much harder and could look more appropriate for the time period. The awards and nominations for cinematography were well earned, not only because of the beautiful final product, but in seeing how much they had to deal with cameras jamming and other problems during the process.<br /><br />In Haneke's films, you never see any direct violence, but the humiliation factor of turning the children into outcasts or failures is horrible enough on its own to let the audience imagine the rest. Haneke talks at length in a feature called \\"My Life\\" about his upbringing, film experience, influences, and reasons for certain styles he uses in his work. This is a very detailed look at the career of Michael Haneke from his perspective and others who have worked with him.<br /><br />There is a feature of footage of the cast and crew at the Cannes Film Festival where the film won the Golden Palm. They take place on a panel for a lengthy Q&A session with the audience talking about the themes of the film and motivations behind the characters.<br /><br />Besides trailers and previews, there is also ANOTHER feature interview with Michael Haneke discussing the film. With all these extras, this Blu-Ray is packed with everything you could want to know about \\"The White Ribbon\\". Beaucoup d'extras!

B000BNX4MC|5.0|\\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" was written by John Hughes in a WEEK because he had an idea and knew he had to make it happen quickly before an oncoming writers' strike. Hughes' directing is always memorable, he knows just how to edit a funny scene to get the most out of it with different perspective shots thrown together. In this story, Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) along with his best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend, Sloan (Mia Sara) skip a day of school to enjoy a day in downtown Chicago seeing the sights in a fabulous sports car.<br /><br />This movie resonates with so many different people because we all have that innate human quality where we crave freedom and a day away from the grind just to do whatever we want. Where we dare to dream, Ferris makes it happen with charm and finesse. No situation can break him as he tip toes around getting caught by his sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), his parents, and his principal, Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones).<br /><br />Matthew Broderick was a young, charismatic (not to mention, CUTE!) guy who had a background on Broadway in Neil Simon plays like \\"Brighton Beach Memoirs\\" (a favorite of mine from my theater days) where his character would spend a lot of time addressing the audience (AAAHH, you're breaking the fourth wall!). That fourth wall break is a difficult thing to do because you have to win over the audience immediately or they won't enjoy hearing the story from your perspective. The character of Ferris is a \\"righteous dude\\" who never actually harms anyone throughout the course of the movie so his reputation as an idol to the student body holds up. He is just so charming and knows just the right degree of push to get someone to do what he wants.<br /><br />Alan Ruck was performing with Broderick on Broadway at the time and there was a concern that his age would make him too old but in the play, both characters were young so they decided to give him a shot for Cameron. Already being friends made it easier to be best friends here. Cameron is a nice, smart, funny guy who lets everyone push him around and the main reason Ferris takes this day off is to try and help his friend. I think everyone has a little bit of Cameron in them with his nerdiness and fear of authority. Mia Sara plays Sloan, the classy girlfriend of Ferris who can keep up with him. In a pinch, she can act her way out of any situation just like him.<br /><br />The ineffective antagonist of the movie is Principal Edward Rooney who wants to catch Ferris and make him an example to other kids so they wouldn't get any ideas like him. Ferris is a symbol for all that is disobedient and anti-conformist, making him miserable at his job. Jeffery Jones' portrayal (and all actors in this film for that matter) just defined him as an actor. Every actor in this movie is remembered for simply BEING in this movie and a lot of careers got off the ground here.<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />There are three featurettes: \\"Getting the Class Together: The Cast of Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" which interviews the cast years later about how the film impacted their careers and lives, \\"The Making of Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" which covered more of the events at the time and how actors ended up in their roles, and \\"Who is Ferris Bueller?\\" which explores the character and what he meant to that generation and every generation afterwards since this movie still holds up.<br /><br />There were a lot of fun things to learn about the movie, for example, the actors who played Ferris' parents met for the first time on the set and went out on some dates to get to know each other better for the movie and later got married in real life.<br /><br />Ben Stein was an unknown in the movie world, his background was being a speech writer for Richard Nixon and was supposed to just be an offscreen voice calling roll but the director thought he was so funny, it got switched to on camera. Then he was asked to improv a classroom scene teaching the kidsabout something he knew a lot about so he talked about the Great Depression and of course, it was hysterical. Ben Stein admits he's not an actor and could never do an accent to save his life but people want him for his distinctive voice and every single day people come up to him just to say \\"Bueller...Bueller...Bueller.\\" There's also a feature called \\"The World according to Ben Stein\\" where again he emphasizes how being in this movie changed his life forever for the better and embarks some of his own personal philosophies on life and living.<br /><br />Another feature is \\"Vintage Ferris Bueller: The Lost Tapes\\" that shows Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, and Mia Sara messing around on the set and interviewing each other and Jeffrey Jones about being in the movie. It's really cute and fun to see them interacting with each other and having a great time with Broderick still wearing the leopard-print vest!<br /><br />I do not know a single person who doesn't like or better yet, LOVE this movie. It just means so much to so many people. For me, it's my favorite escape movie when I'm sick or just bummed out because it always lifts me with its comedy.t Depression and of course, it was hysterical. Ben Stein admits he's not an actor and could never do an accent to save his life but people want him for his distinctive voice and every single day people come up to him just to say \\"Bueller...Bueller...Bueller.\\" There's also a feature called \\"The World according to Ben Stein\\" where again he emphasizes how being in this movie changed his life forever for the better and embarks some of his own personal philosophies on life and living.    Another feature is \\"Vintage Ferris Bueller: The Lost Tapes\\" that shows Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, and Mia Sara messing around on the set and interviewing each other and Jeffrey Jones about being in the movie. It's really cute and fun to see them interacting with each other and having a great time with Broderick still wearing the leopard-print vest!    I do not know a single person who doesn't like or better yet, LOVE this movie. It just means so much to so many people. For me, it's my favorite escape movie when I'm sick or just bummed out because it always lifts me with its comedy.
1449910416|5.0|Yes, I cried several times when I reread this classic. It is filled with the stuff that modern America needs: A decent respect for humanity, a will to help the sick, the tired, the poor, the hungry, the weak, the crippled. Scrooge changed and so can the current tendency to disrepect and discourtesy anyone and everything. The plot of the story is well known: Jacob Marley returns from the grave to warn Scrooge that the chance to help people and the chance to get great joy by helping people will vanish after death. Alas, it's too late for poor Marley who must prowl about the globe seeing terrible things that he could have helped while alive but now cannot help at all. The moral reality of the idea of the strengthless dead needs greater emphasis than it usually gets: The time to do good is now, now, now. Fortunately, Scrooge sees the warning clearly, the three ghosts of Christmas having done their job well, and Scrooge wakes up on Christmas day to do the good deeds he should have been doing all along. This is a book for all seasons, not just Christmas.
B00275EGWY|5.0|This is not my favorite movie genre, but I will say it is a well-made movie.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker was directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) and written by Mark Boal. It stars Jeremy Renner as Sgt. William James, a team leader for a bomb squad stationed in Iraq. The other members of his team are Sgt. JT Sanborn played by Anthony Mackie and Spc. Owen Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty. The story takes place over a 39 day period where Bravo company is waiting to be relieved so they can go home.<br /><br />This movie's directing is fantastic. The terrifying suspense that builds over time with each bomb wondering if it will be someone's last bomb to attempt to defuse. The terrain, heat, and dust were so well captured, they were making ME thirsty! Emotionally, the life and death situation these soldiers were put into everyday really messed with their psyche and perception of their mortality. James is a wildman, fearless to just jump into any situation recklessly, Sanborn tries his best to keep everyone safe but is afraid of commitment and getting too close to a woman back home, and Eldridge is getting therapy from a Colonel because he so intensely feels the strain that every day he might die.<br /><br />The actors very clearly defined their characters. All were well developed with layers in their performance, not all bravado or all fear. They just worked amazingly well as a unit. I have a hard time even singling out any of the three because as soon as I attribute something to one in my head, I remember something else one of the others did. Let's just say they handled the heavy burden of this movie incredibly well and I hope to see more from them in the future.<br /><br />One last note, turns out James' wife back home is Evangeline Lilly, Kate from LOST. My husband and James have something in common, if that was what they had to come home to, they'd be bored too, haha. We're not Kate or Jack fans. We are fans of Locke and Ben and Hurley!
B001675YQ6|5.0|This movie is absolutely adorable. It's kind of sad at first just because Brittany Murphy is no longer alive, and remembering that is obviously disheartening. Once you get past that, however, this romantic comedy is a perfect feel good movie. While it doesn't lack cliches that this genre is known for, it is different from the average romantic comedy. It also has a couple very attractive, love-able men, which is always a plus, and you end the movie wanting to be BFF with Brittany Murphy's character, which I think is fun. Definitely worth watching--I highly recommend it!
B001HN69AY|4.0|The tagline reads, \\"A traveling theater company gives its audience much more than they were expecting.\\" I would concur with that.<br /><br />\\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\" was written and directed by Terry Gilliam who also directed the Monty Python movies that we know and love as well as the classic, \\"Brazil\\". It clearly shows that it came from the same mind as Brazil....with a better budget and more impressive digital effects than he's ever used before. If you are a Gilliam fan, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer plays Doctor Parnassus, a monk tempted by the devil (Mr. Nick) played by Tom Waits into a game of betting for souls in order to reap rewards like immortality, youth, love, and family. In this latest bet, he risks losing his daughter, Valentina played by Lily Cole, forever. Chance results in coming across a doomed man who calls himself Tony played by Heath Ledger. As we all know, Ledger died before completing his filming so different versions of Tony going through a magic mirror into the Doctor's imagination are played by Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell.<br /><br />It is a lot to take in, but it has the feel of a dark fairy tale that you may have read from the Grimm's. The themes of good and evil and temptation are common themes, but it feels like a fresh presentation. Doctor Parnassus' method of attracting souls is hitching himself and his family in a giant carriage and setting up a fold-out stage everywhere they go, decked out in fantasy costumes, calling out to the crowds offering a life-changing experience. His magic mirror doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you go in, it's CGI galore. Beauty, fantasy, and occasionally danger and temptation provided by Mr. Nick. Each person who enters must make a choice between purity and temptations and that is how the souls are collected.<br /><br />I was really happy to see Verne Troyer in a role like this that was so dialogue heavy and free of Mini-Me. I might even be able to forgive odd reality show stints like The Surreal Life from this performance. Lily Cole was a real stand-out in beauty but also captured the young ingenue never understanding her father's real background or her own origins, wanting to break free and lead a normal life. There is just no taking your eyes off her on screen, the camera loves her and she is captivating.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer played a tragic character dealing with the side effects of immortality and depression, clearly an alcoholic with many regrets. Each bet since the first seems to offer a chance at redemption, but each sinks him deeper down into his own personal torment. Tom Waits was a wonderful devil with a pencil-thin mustache and a joyful demeanor living only to continue the fun of the game.<br /><br />Heath Ledger's performance was clearly well thought out like many of his roles with little ticks and motivations behind his mysterious background. You never get the complete picture on Tony as bits and pieces come out over time. The trick with using three additional actors to fill in was ingenious to the story, except for his last section of scenes. There's a point where Tony realizes it's HIS world in the imaginarium at that moment and it would have made more sense to revert to his original self for that last sequence but for obvious reasons, impossible. It is noticeable at that essential point, but Collin Farrell does his best to wrap it up. Each of the three actors brought their own business to the role as could be expected and seemed like extensions of the most charming versions of themselves from other films. They did deliver adequately enough in a pinch and there is so much going on in that imaginary world that there is plenty to distract you from it.<br /><br />This whole movie feels mind-bending with the story and effects. It isn't the way you want to remember Heath Ledger by, that's for sure. His character's entrance and exit from the movie are sobering and chilling. It's a movie that will stick with you a while as it is thought provoking and a fascinating character study. Definitely worth a watch!ught provoking and a fascinating character study. Definitely worth a watch!
B001NGWFQ2|5.0|Just wanted to add my praise to this album, one of the top albums from 2009 for me. Difficult to compare with anything else but there's a touch of the crazy intersection of metal, avent-garde jazz and dance music it shares with Shining's [[ASIN:B001BF1MLY Blackjazz]]. Yes I really said dance music, but this comes from a guy who likes to dance to [[ASIN:B00004TA40 Ascension]]. For me, rhythm is at the heart of these different forms of music, and this is a rhythm album. The guitar input from King Buzzo and, in particular, vocal input from Mike Patton really helps to make this. The sound quality is extremely impressive. This album flows beautifully from the immediacy of floorpounding Ostia to ethereal Orc.    Congratulations Zu for this, which for me was a complete revelation. Thank you.
B001FB55L2|4.0|\\"Brothers\\" was directed by Jim Sheridan, director of \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" in 2005 and is based on the motion picture \\"Brødre\\" from Denmark. The story is about two brothers, Tommy and Sam played by Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal. Sam is the good son, a marine deployed to Afghanistan and Tommy has always been a bit of a screw-up and just got out of jail. While Sam is gone, Tommy attempts to take care of Sam's wife, Grace played by Natalie Portman and their daughters.<br /><br />At this point, the film takes a \\"Pearl Harbor\\" turn and Sam is announced dead to his family back home from a crash, but the audience knows he's actually been taken as a P.O.W. The grief and Tommy's great playfulness with the children brings Tommy and Grace closer together to try to build back the broken family. Until one day when Sam returns home....<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, do not watch the trailer first, go in blind. The trailer really emphasizes the few moments of heightened tension in the film and makes it sound like this really intense nonstop drama. In truth, most of this movie is spent with long quiet sad looks and adorable children playing. The overall film was a result felt underwhelming from what I was expecting. I would not call this film boring though. What kept me interested were the individual performances.<br /><br />Tobey Maguire has really picked a good role here with Captain Sam Cahill. In the beginning of the movie, he's a loving father and husband and when he smiles he looks just like Peter Parker with a military crew cut. After being put through the physical and emotional torture of imprisonment, he comes back a damaged man projecting his turmoil on everyone around him. His post-traumatic stress is always simmering under the surface and really comes to a boil near the end in a powerful scene where he screams at his wife about how much he loves her while waving a gun around.<br /><br />The big question throughout the film in regards to Grace and Tommy is did they or didn't they? Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhaal bring poignant performances to this otherwise very depressing film. Serious Kudos to young Bailee Madison for her portrayl of daughter, Isabelle. She shows maturity beyond her years with control of a very difficult role. It is definitely worth a watch for slow building drama and more commentary on the after-effects of war, but while they are explosive moments, it is not nearly as intense as the trailer might have you believe.Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhaal bring poignant performances to this otherwise very depressing film.

B002BSHWUU|4.0|This is a mirror of my review on the mono version of this release, now that I have had time to go through both.  It is less a review of the albums themselves, rather, which boxed set is best, particularly if you only can afford one, or even just don't want two copies of something that is almost, bot not quite the same.    Musically (pulled from the mono review):  The the music is amazingly, almost insidiously brilliant is beyond doubt. The sheer amount of songs on all of these albums that are recognizable is beyond doubt. The Beatles influence on modern music cannot, in my estimation, be underrated.  All of the albums have remarkable musical strengths.   On the stereo release, my favourite albums are Abbey Road, Magical Mystery Tour and the White album, which were all recorded with a bit more of a nod towards stereo imaging.    Boxed set specific (again some of this was pasted from my mono review, as appropriate)  The downside...  Nothing to do with the actual music, but rather, the apparent greed of the label. For the vast majority of the Beatles albums sound better on the mono release.  The latter albums sound better in stereo, and, the mono version does not contain the later releases that were stereo only (Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road, Let it Be, also the videos).  So you have three choices:  1) Buy the mono, and if you want the latter albums, buy them separately. Considering the mono version is more expensive to start with this is a frustrating option.  2) Buy the stereo version. You get all the albums, and thus some sense of completeness, with this method.  But not all, or even the majority are in their optimal format.  3) Buy both. Maybe the only way to make sure you get your preferred version of each album.  The obvious annoyance, is cost.  And who really wants to buy two boxed sets for completeness sake, apart from those like me who want both optimal and completeness.  It does annoy me that to get this I needed to have so much space taken up, but, such is life.    Comparatively, my review is not as good as many of the others here, that is obvious, but as a mainly metal fan I still have to admit to this bands genius and believe most collections are replete without at least one of these re-releases. It's just a shame about the purchasing options..   As per my mono boxed set review, it is a shame that the releases have come out like this, but I have to recommend this stereo boxed set over the mono, especially if you only wish to own one of the boxed sets for whatever reason you have.
B0000639FE|5.0|\\"Jerry Maguire\\" was written and directed by Cameron Crowe who also wrote and directed \\"Elizabethtown\\", \\"Almost Famous\\", and \\"Say Anything.\\" It is about a sports agent played by Tom Cruise who in a sudden change of conscience when it comes to his work, ends up losing his job and girlfriend. With his single client, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.), he has to find a way back to success and negotiates the biggest deal of his life when a single mother (Renee Zellweger) and her son enter his life.<br /><br />This is the movie that got Cuba the Oscar in one of the most memorable Oscar moments that I can remember involving a spinning-on-his-head break-dance and shouting that he loved Tom Cruise and others. He truly deserved that Oscar in his performance as Rod Tidwell, the athlete with a huge chip on his shoulder and crazy passion for his family and the \\"quawn\\" (his coined term for money). He is so charismatic and loud and emotional and is a huge part of this movie's success. In fact, when I heard someone trying to sing, \\"Brother, brother, brother...\\" on American Idol the other night, all I could think of was how Rod Tidwell did it better at Jerry Maguire's wedding. His performance is so great here, it overshadows everyone else. He works amazingly well with Regina King who plays his wife in her defining role as strong family woman. Her emotion for her family always gets me, particularly when Rod gets injured. She is an amazing actress so I found her recent performance in \\"Our Family Wedding\\" to be lacking since she doesn't get to have as much power as she normally does.<br /><br />Tom Cruise really went to the depths of despair as far as he could here with Jerry Maguire. His drunken ramblings here are reminiscent of his drunken ramblings in \\"A Few Good Men\\" as well. Jerry Maguire and his competition, Bob Sugar played by Jay Mohr really became the voice of a generation of sports agents the way Gorden Gekko and Bud Fox did for stockbrokers. There are so many amazing fast-talking scenes on the phone that are edited together brilliantly in a flow almost like a dance. Cruise's monologue to the agency after he is fired is peppered with moments of dramatic and comedic brilliance equally, I love it when he takes the loyal goldfish with him.<br /><br />It is easy to get wrapped up in the relationship between Jerry and Rod but when it comes to Dorothy Boyd, it's something different entirely. There is some great romance here and it's nice to see a more realistic story about a woman giving all the love she can but being strong enough to know when her man isn't yet capable of returning it and stand up for herself. Dorothy's son, Ray played by Jonathan Lipnicki in the most notable breakout role of his career, really charms the audience with being cute. I just IMDBed this kid and I can't believe it, he's 20 now and got contacts apparently, you wouldn't recognize him if you passed him on the street. The reunion scene between Jerry and Dorothy is infamous now and has been quoted time and time again and parodied in such movies as \\"A Night at the Roxbury\\" to perfection. Also Bonnie Hunt as Dorothy's \\"disapproving sister, Laurel\\" is dead on.<br /><br />This is a fantastic movie with a great through line of narration that slows down once in a while with the love story but if you focus on the other characters in the movie, you'll really enjoy the ride.<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />Cameron Crowe is nothing if not thorough on this edition of the Jerry Maguire DVD. There is audio in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. There are subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai. Another thorough touch: You can view the ENTIRE mission statement in text form and if you pop Disc 2 into your computer as a DVD-rom extra, you can read the script to the movie.<br /><br />There is audio commentary by Cameron Crowe, Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding, Jr. AND there is video commentary on Disc 2! This is the first time I've seen video commentary as an option along with audio and I've learned this: while a unique idea, it probably isn't the best idea. They're not using makeup people here and Tom Cruise is wearing the droopiest bucket hat ever and it makes you wonder if he's covering up a hangover. He gets a little loopy as it goes on. They have two different monitors in the room they are viewing the movie on so Cuba is looking one way and the other three are looking the other throughout. They do interact with each other on stories sometimes and Renee and Tom look a little like they want to blush during the love scenes but overall, you don't gain as much as you'd think from this new perspective.<br /><br />There are deleted scenes with optional director and editor commentary and they look awful. They aren't finished looking, practically like you are watching them with a scratchy VCR and the audio is difficult to hear. The commentary doesn't give many answers except things like \\"this didn't seem to fit the mood, those poor guys spent 12 hours on that take for nothing\\" or \\"this pickle mascot was funny but we took him out.\\" The BEST extended take is getting to see Jay Mohr let loose and go on one really, really long take of being handed phone after phone talking to clients and never losing it. Apparently the director always sent that take to people when they asked about working with Mohr and he would usually get the job as a result. Now Mohr is in a TV series called \\"Gary Unmarried\\" and I also reviewed that if you want to check it out.<br /><br />You can also watch rehearsal footage with optional director commentary and I recommend as with the deleted scenes that you listen to the commentary instead because the audio is difficult to hear and it looks like a VHS tape again here. What you gain from rehearsal footage (which I don't often see on DVDs) is a really raw look at how the actors got from A to B.<br /><br />There's a cute extra called \\"My First Commercial\\" that features Cuba as Rod Tidwell doing a Reebok commercial and it's pretty funny. Bruce Springsteen's \\"Secret Garden\\" music video is also on this disc and I remember you couldn't go anywhere that year without that song coming on the radio complete with sound bits from the movie laced in.<br /><br />There is a making-of featurette that goes into detail about the character of Jerry Maguire and why Tom Cruise who is often viewed as a success wanted to venture off into the world of failure and redemption for a change and how all the actors worked together and what they thought of the project and their characters.<br /><br />One last interesting extra is Drew Rosenhaus, a sports agent giving a spiel on his life and career and how hungry he has to be as a sports agent to get the job done. It's pretty funny because when it was taped he has a giant cell phone and a super-thick lap top that I bet was pretty impressive at the time.

B0028K3192|5.0|At the time Maxwell dropped this stellar album, I was so distracted by another musical genius and the tragedy that had befallen him, I could not focus.  All the while, I was listening and asking could it really be so?  Could it be so, that Maxwell is incapable of making a bad album?   This.  Man. Is totally incapable of making a bad album!!!  I love every single song just as I've loved every single song on every single album that Maxwell has blessed us with.    My most hugest, biggest crush at this moment is STOP THE WORLD.  I don't know if Maxwell can be touched, lyrically, at this given time.  He says, in many of these songs what every woman needs to, longs to hear.  He is so incredibly, romantically, lyrically gifted in a very cool and soulful way.   STOP THE WORLD reminds me of PRINCE on a very, very good day.      The music on this album is crazy good.  Who are these musicians?   Like all the rest, Blacksummer's night is another timeless album by this amazingly, talented man. I don't begrudge Maxwell for taking his time and putting it down.  In a nutshell:  Not a bad song on it.  An album men and women can fall in love with.  Will stand the test of time.  Soulful, mellow and jazzy.
B002RSDW8A|4.0|I enjoyed this video very much.  Merle Streep is great as always. I would recommend this movie to a friend.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Avoid seeing this Cameron ego trip on the small screen because its confused and overall horrid script and muddy characterizations will not have a massive screen to carry things along.  This is a typical example of Hollywood's all flash and no substance.  Take away the flash by reducing your screen size and the hollow shell will certainly disappoint you.  Skip the home versions.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I loved this version of Emma. I highly recommend this DVD to any Jane Austen fan.  Johnny Lee Miller is wonderful as Mr. Knightly.
B0001ARCFA|3.0|They have a good sound and don't get uncomfortable after wearing them for a long time.  It's actually bad to listen to some music through them, with a good headphone amp, because you can hear all the high-frequency flaws and imperfections in the recording.<br /><br />Actually, years after writing this, I've realized that these headphones are really distorted.  Play a 100 Hz or lower sine wave through them and it will be obvious, in both channels.  Other headphones reproduce the same frequencies but without distortion.<br /><br />Also the cable failed after a while, and the replacement is $30, half the price of the headphones.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|Agree I will wait for the special director's cut to get all the special content.  This was 25.00 over the last few days and now it's showing 24.99.  My guess that is a move to get you to pay shipping charges since 25.00 is the min for free shipping unless you have prime.
B000N3ST7K|4.0|the version of \\"Hold Tight!\\" on this cd is mediocre compared to other version(s) out there.

The version I bought, downloaded from Amazon, came from their \\"Remind\\" album

0307269981|4.0|I think the book was great!  A very entertaining story with a lot of mysterious characters that will keep you guessing until the last pages.  I liked the fact the it continues the story from previous book.  It seemed that it was just part of the first book and had a continued flow.  There are new characters that will play a big role.  I can't wait to get the 3rd installment.  If you liked the first book you are going to enjoy the 2nd for sure!
B002S0OBN2|5.0|Well obviously the reviews are very mixed on Love Never Dies. As one who just loves musicals in general, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Love Never Dies. When I first heard POTO, I was hooked. Well, the same has happened with Love Never Dies. I'm hooked! Sure, the story didn't play out quite the way I expected, but that makes it all the more interesting! I'm glad I ordered the Deluxe Edition because it includes a great DVD with bonus features and behind the scenes footage as well as a libretto, which is basically the whole Love Never Dies script. And that really helped when it came to understanding the story. If you love musicals or if you have enjoyed anything by Andrew Lloyd Webber, you will enjoy Love Never Dies. Give it a chance!
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Excellent CD. This is the first time in years I`ve really been impressed with a talent like her. It`s about time. I never get sick of listening to her. I immediately got her first CD also.  NOT at all disappointed.  Can`t wait for her next CD
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I bought my first HP 12C in 1981 and am still using it.  I decided to buy a second one so I can keep one at the office and one at home.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the HP 12C Platinum has all of the features that I like so much on my 1981 model, and has added some features not included on my original.    The only caution I would mention is that the RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) form of entry is different enough from the standard calculater mode that you will eather hate it or grow to hate the standard mode.  As an illustration, to add 1 to 1 and arrive at the result 2 in standard mode involves the following keystrokse:  1 + 1 =. In RPN mode, you use the keystrokes:  1 enter 1 +.  The HP 12C did not offer the standard mode, but the HP 12C Platinum offers both.  I still use the RPN mode, and prefer it over the standard mode.    I think you'll grow to appreciate this calculator as much as I do.
B002RD4UZ4|5.0|Melody Gardot is and will always be one of my choices as the unknown best in the field of jazz vocals. Her songs and voicing along with the musicians backing her on this cd are just simply great.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is truly one of the most touching movies I have ever, EVER seen, it is very sad but one of the best watches you can ever wish for! And, it is based on a true story and to learn about this dog and this amazing level of love and devotion, is inspiring, truly touching and inspiring. Despite how sad this movie is (this movie had me in tears through half the film! and I am a big, musuclar, former football player, bouncer and bodyguard!) it is one of the most wonderful, deep, emotional films ever made, and the cast is itself amazing with the always great Richard Gere at his best, Joan Allen wonderful as always, and the always cool Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa once again, cool as always! Along with Jason Alexander and Erick Avari, this is an all-star cast in a movie that is one of the best films I have ever, ever seen!
1423101472|5.0|Ordered book for daughter, she previously read volumes 1-4,wasn't complete without reading book 5.She loved it!. She couldn't wait to see movie and enjoyed that also.There were a few things different from the book, but she still enjoyed the show. Looking for a book 6 if possible.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|This movie look exceptionally good on blu ray. the colors are vivid and bright and the sound is crisp and clear. there are over 3 hours of extra features on the second disk. there is also a demo game for star trek on the third disk. The demo game was a waste of time not worth playing. Acting was excellent and the story kept pace and didn't get boring. Tyler perry was an admiral in this movie and he made me wanna puke but he only had about 5 minutes in the film so it wasn't too bad; at least they didnt give him a starring role elese i wouldn't have bothered to buy the film. Overall the director did an excellent job on the movie and I'm waiting for star trek 2 (hopefully Tyler Perry won't be in another star trek movie)!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I thought 'Mad Men' was going to move me like this...and while it is very good, it can't touch 'Breaking Bad'.  BB is the best thing to come along since my beloved 'The WIRE' ran its course.      It is a twisted combination of, 'Of Mice and Men', 'Midnight Cowboy', 'Some Like it Hot', 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', and 'The Odd Couple'.  The pathos and black comedy are sublime, yet in your heart of hearts, you know this can only end badly for both Walter and Jesse. They are irreparably 'broken' by what they have experienced.      What does that say about America?  Both generations, 'Baby Boomers = Walt' and 'Gen. Xers = Jesse' are like 'The Whispers' \\"Olivia\\", they're 'hopelessly lost and turned out'...God have mercy on us all.
1423119509|4.0|Although this series is for young adults, adults will enjoy it as well, it reads very similiar to the Harry Potter series, so if you liked Harry Potter you are going to love this.  Excellent references to mythology and an easy, fast-paced, enjoyable read.  Excellent series.
B00007AJGH|5.0|This is one of the greatist movies I have grew up on as a child and sadly movies like these don't exist anymore. The story is the most valuable part of this movie and the characters too.<br />The toon hater eddie valiant (bob hoskins) who has been set up in a crazy sceme for a greedy studio owner must help roger rabbit who has been set up for murder prove he's innocent and get the justice he deserves  and to get the killer of the evil judge doom (christopher lloyed) to justice. This is one of the best family films even now and days it's still an epic classic that would want other youngsters watching also.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />RIP Bob Hoskins (1942 - 2014)

B00319KS7C|4.0|Matt Damon does his usual good acting job in this story of a sociopathic biochemist/businessman.    The film style is rather quirky with an incongruous soundtrack and stylistic settings in the Midwestern United States. I was kept interested throughout the film by new revelations regarding Whitaker's embezzlements.    The story progresses from Whitaker seeming to be a blameless whistle-blower to being the creative force in his own little 10 million dollar embezzlement scheme, while the company he worked for ripped consumers off for hundreds of millions in price fixing.    If you are a matt Damon fan I think you will enjoy this film.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This was by far the best season of Dexter and John Lithgow played a fantastic role!  It is extremely creepy, but brilliant and there are so many twist and turns in the season you won't get bored!   But i should warn you, you probably won't leave the house for the entire day because you will be watching episode after episode!! It is not only the best, but also the most addictive season!!!  Highly recommend getting it if you haven't seen it already!  Even if you have seen it, i would still get it!! I know i'm getting it :)
B0035P0OTE|5.0|I really like this album because this is the first rapper, I know of, to step out of the usual rap and hip-hop beats. I think there are going to be many rap and hip-hop fans that will not like it because it is different and does not fit there typical category for rap and hip-hop. I do not have a problem with Lil Wayne's music, but I do admit that as a person, he is not the best role model.<br /><br />I really like what he has done in this album!
B000BJV3E2|4.0|The book's title and premise, Catch-22, is a term defined a number of ways by many men in the course of Joseph Heller's seminal book from 1955. Each time, Catch-22 is referred to as an irrational policy for legalized craziness - a way to make sure that no combat pilot can be grounded for being crazy - especially when they are crazy.<br /><br />A fellow airman, suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress, is described as \\"babbling incoherently when they fished him out of the dank bottom of the slit trench, babbling of snakes, rats and spiders. The others flashed their searchlights down just to make sure. There was nothing inside but a few inches of stagnant rain water.\\" Following the hallucinations and panic attack, the airman, absurdly named Hungry Joe, is almost immediately re-assigned air combat duty by his superiors.<br /><br />Heller's own experiences as a B-52 bombadier relate with a painfull, crisp clarity the effects of war on the male psyche.<br /><br />Heller presents War as institutionalized insanity - a world at war being enough to drive anyone who lives in it completely crazy. Bombadier Yossarian, although high-strung and violent, is the lone sane man in a world gone completely crazy with war. The only place Yossarian feels safe at is a military hospital in western Italy. At this hospital, Yossarian is surrounded by war-jangled men who've come down with sudden cases of sanity in the face of a fiery death. They each argue the meaning of Catch-22 while trying to find a way to survive the war.
0767802470|5.0|This was a excellent movie on the life of German submariners during WW2. Makes the submarines of today look like under water cruise ships by comparision.     BUT DONT STOP HERE! After you watch this great film, read \\"Iron Coffins\\" by Herbert Werner. Which is a real life account of his career in the U-boat flotilla. What Werner experieces even tops what happened to the characters in this movie, and this guy is STILL alive in his 90's living in Florida! Amazing!
0618918248|3.0|This, along with books by Hitchins and Harris, are enjoyable reads and make some salient points. The problem with Dawkins, as well as the other authors here mentioned, is the way that they pick on the most shallow and literalist versions of religion in existence. If Dawkins really devoted some time to studying the Perennial Philosophy and some of the more intelligent Eastern and Western religious thinkers, and studied the experiences of the saints and mystics of different traditions, he might not be so swift to discredit all religion. But then again, maybe he would. After all, atheism, and the modern materialist view in general, seem uninterested in personal experiences or revelations. Atheism is bent on explaining everything in terms of objective, empirical evidence. What about subjectivity? What about 'my' experience?     This new atheism is just as shallow as the religious fundamentalism it attacks, and is a cold, purely logical attempt to explain everything with the preconception that only that which is verifiable by the five senses can be considered real. At least Sam Harris, in 'The End of Faith' had the sense to stick up for experiential, empirical 'spiritual' practices such as Buddhist meditation. Both religious fundamentalism and Dawkin's brand of atheism are sides of the same coin. Both are the results of a tremendous imbalance: masculine over feminine, logic over myth and intuition, and the left side of the brain over the right side of the brain. The symptoms of this imbalance are manifesting everywhere: the arts are losing their place in schools, the crafts are no longer valued, aboriginal peoples are losing their land and their livelihood, and valuable human, archetypal myths are being discarded as useless. What a tragedy!
B0000TB03W|5.0|this is a superb video, with most of Shania's hit songs. the video is fantastic just like the artist. The part with the 3 little girls,I found was so cool, and the guy who proposed to his girlfriend in front of so many people, awesome.

B002GJT4XW|5.0|These box sets are extremely nice; at almost 7-3/4 inches (194mm) tall, 5-3/4 inches (145mm) deep and just over 2 inches (52mm) wide, make sure you have enough room on your shelf to display these (remember, there's going to be eight of these sets).

0307454541|1.0|Agree with all the above. Cliche ridden exposition. Maybe it's just the translation, but this book was disappointing.
142313494X|5.0|I thought The Lightning Thief was a fantastic book to start a series. I liked how the characters were very important and memorable. It was a page-turner book that just got better and better throughout the series. It wasn't like the Pendragon series, which got worse throughout the series. I can't even think of anything negative to say about this book. If you like the first book, continue the series! Anyone who likes hip-type, funny, n magic and god relating books, READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!
B002SJIO4A|4.0|In the special features, director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp makes an explicit statement that this movie is first and foremost for the purpose of Entertainment. To his credit, he is obviously an astute observer of the human condition and the story that makes its way to the screen is more than just entertainment.<br /><br />The main story follows a story of how two individuals, hostile aliens to one-another, find a level of commonness where it wouldn't have seemed possible from a casual outside perspective (as cleverly illustrated by the initial perspective of a documentary that flows into a more conventional 3rd person narration). It is a story of how we treat \\"others,\\" in the guise of extraterrestrial aliens and human aliens who live outside of the mainstream. Woven throughout the tale are layers upon layers of us-versus-them themes and the demeaning consequences each has on our existence.<br /><br />Beyond this informed tale of relationships is a blisteringly paced action thriller pitting a ruthless paramilitary corporation against a hapless group of refugees and a man who finds himself literally torn between the worlds. While the science fiction is pretty poorly imagined (Blomkamp admits that he didn't work hard on this aspect), the choreography of the action is intense and visceral; a well done amalgam that takes pieces from just about any decent sci-fi action movie you can think of.... And for those inclined to enjoy dark, sometimes bleak humor, you'll find a fair amount here.<br /><br />So other than the weak science, District 9 is riveting. Prepare to experience a brutal world of extreme alienation, and hope that we might grow away from the tendency towards this sort of dystopia some day.
0802136834|1.0|This read very like a history textbook, a dry recitation of names, facts, and dates.
0882847953|2.0|I'm not commenting on the content, but this is hand-written musical notation that looks like it has been through a few generations or recopying.  It looks sloppy, and when you are taxing your brain trying to learn exercises, you shouldn't have to worry about reading muddy and blurry print the publisher was too lazy to spend a couple hundred bucks to transcribe into sharp, readable text.  Sometimes, it's hard to tell the quarter rests from the quarter notes, such as on the bottom right of page 5.
0812973992|4.0|I generally am patient about books but after hearing  author Colum McCann interviewed on NPR,I went to my library. They had the book, but it was out. I ordered \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" online from Amazon and because I have \\"PRIME\\" ,it arrived in two days. I have  certain criteria for judging books. The writing must be excellent, the characters believable, and the plot line  must be progressing toward  the answers. The narrative does not have to be riveting; I prefer evenness. Yet I admire an author who can pull me in to the narrative so well  that I feel more like an observer than a reader.<br /><br />\\"Let the Great World Spin\\" is the work of someone who knows his craft and who knows how to weave characters and more characters into a complicated plot It is a story of loss and hurt, of healing and hopefulness.  First and last it is a story of love and connectedness. It is elegantly and beautifully written. It is NOT TO BE MISSED.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|This is a very awesome CD that shows a very fresh and new side of Enigma never before seen.  It's funky, upbeat, different, and even a new language that Engima has never explored in its music to date.  I found it great to listen to, meditate, work out, and fun to crank up in the car and go for a drive.
1932100660|5.0|This book stands out for its enlightenment of the bodily functions regarding diet and long term good health.  It reveals the importance of healthy eating and how vital nutrition is to the betterment of life. The fact that cancer and many other diseases have a direct connection to the lack of good nutrition is defined so wonderfully in this book. It is changing my selection of the foods I consume now and I regard nutrition with greater understanding.  I've not finished the book, but I will be very soon and I will pass it on to my children hoping this will help them to secure a better future, both physically and mentally. I've touted this book to all those that will listen and I most certainly let them know I purchased it through Amazon.com. at a very reasonable price.
B000055Y0X|5.0|I was just a kid when this movie came out.<br /><br />I didn't get ANY of the sexual innuendo and didn't know who the hell Stanley Kubrik was but, guess what, I laughed my little butt off and loved the movie!<br /><br />Over the years Dr. Strangelove has been on every late night movie marathon station enough times for me to see all the little things I missed as a kid and I've liked it more and more each time I've seen it.<br /><br />Don't worry about what sort of cameras they used to film it or where the actors bought their cigars or any of the other trivial crap the other reviewers seem to think is important; nuke some popcorn, sit back and just have fun watching some of the greatest actors of all time doing what they do best - entertaining!
B00004UEDQ|4.0|Sandra Bullock shined throughout the movie, of course, but we also liked Loudon Wainwright III's few appearances and his songs.  Surprisingly, Steve Buscemi fit well in the role of an addictions counselor.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|Bought the box set as a christmas gift for my sister and she loves it, but we did have a little bit of a mess getting it replaced when we found that a disc was missing fron the set. Aside from that, the box set is awesome. Love the show.
1582406723|4.0|I like this series. I bought Volumes 1 to 8. The story is very engaging. However, there is such a thing as \\"too much of a good thing\\". I gave it 4 stars because the series goes on and on, I just don't know if I want to invest much more in the series. A great ending somewhere between Volume 10 and 12 would be nice. I am not sure if I will ever get there as the series volumes just keep going, and going, and going.....
B000ERU5EK|5.0|Above and Beyond really went out of their way with this cd. My favorite track has to be \\"Can't Sleep\\" with Ashley Tomberlin from Luminary. This album is beautifully mixed and very mellow. It made me fall in love with the trance genre and turned me into an AB fan for life. Oceanlab cannot compare to their original music. This is Above and Beyond at their finest.
B00338QENI|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this novel, but was quite surprised at the humanity found within. The Lacks family has been through so much, and it really makes you stop to think what right the Medical association had to profit off her cells and give nothing to the family. Henrietta Lacks daughter Deborah especially is a victim of this, and without giving much away is just as interesting and funny as any character in fiction.<br /><br />Part history of the cells, part history of the family, this novel is filled with humanity and a must-buy if you like biographies.

B001GCUO52|5.0|Fans of horror movies can't miss this one.  Without any big Hollywood star, no big budget, the story is told with rythm, involving you.  I'm a big fan of it.
B001QOGYFO|2.0|This was an ok movie.  B-rated, wouldn't recommend it for anyone else to buy.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|I'm a big fan of John's previous work.  I have every album he's made so far and a ton of other concert downloads.  With that said I'm not a fan of this album.  I've listened to it online, didn't buy it, and I heard it live in concert.  It's not bad but it's not something that you can really get into.  In my opinion it's too slow and depressing.  For example, in one of the songs he repeats \\"All we ever do is say goodbye\\" over and over again.  Does that sound like something you'd enjoy listening to?  If not then I recommend that you skip this album because it's a pretty good sample of what's inside.  Hopefully we'll get back to the good stuff in the next album.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|you need to consider international customers who dont have english as MOTHER TONGUE!!!!this is why i gave ONE star only
0307463745|1.0|Please do not read this book. I want everyone to keep doing business as they always have - screwing the consumer, talking instead of doing, and pretending to be important. What if my competitors read this book?? The only saving grace is that most people are too stupid, arrogant, or self-important to take the advice in here. But seriously, what were you guys thinking?? I'm FURIOUS that these two a-holes have the audacity to share all of the most important business advice in one single, easy-to-read book. Jerks.
0896898288|5.0|When you look at the number of blocks in this book don't be overwhelmed.  I just finished piecing the Civil War Love Letters, all 121 blocks.  It's rather addicting once you get started.  The letters in The Farmers Wife and the blocks are so charming I can't wait to get started. This will be a joy to piece. Even if you never sew one block the book is beautiful to look at and fun to read.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Excellent cinematography, solid editing and directing, and a good performance from Portman and a superb and brilliant performance from Weaving.  I haven't read the original story/graphic novel, but I really enjoyed the visuals and idealistic beliefs portrayed in the film.      We do live in a world where the majority of the people are silent, because they lack the conviction to say something.  We do live in a world where governments silently threaten the majority.  We are in a world where governments do not act on behalf of the people [who voted them in], but instead act on their own agendas.  We do live in a world, where sometimes a vendetta by those agrieved by political hurts is the only way of expression.  Hopefully this film wakes the silent majority up!    A thoroughly spellbinding and enjoyable experience, a must see.    Dave
B001NLKT60|5.0|So I read The Girl With The Dragoon Tattoo and loved it, so I picked up the sequel and couldn't put it down.  The Girl Who Played With Fire definitely picks up where the first left off although with a new \\"case\\" to solve.  And like the first, I'm always a bit confused with the first and last names of the characters - Larsson uses both - so sometimes I'm not sure who's being referred to.  This isn't a dig on the book or author, just my own issue that I noticed.<br /><br />Here in this latest action packed book, you'll find yourself getting caught up in a world of underground crime and violence that packs a punch.  One of the things that I use to evaluate a book is whether or not I have any of those \\"whoa, I never saw that coming\\" moments.  And in this book, I actually had a few - some more than others - but one was a whopper (don't worry no spoilers here).<br /><br />One of the reviews I read had said this book was full of cliches but I've been sitting here trying to think of what s/he was referring to.  Yes, you do have the good guys, the bad guys, the ones caught in middle but the twists and turns that Larsson throws at you are fun and exciting...at least for me they were.  Maybe these are the cliches but I guess if this is the case, I'd like a few more please!<br /><br />I do suppose in an instance or two, some things could be a little farfetched but the subsequent explanations seem plausible.  One thing I did enjoy was having some of my questions answered that remained from the first book.  I wanted to know a bit more about some of the characters in the first book and, unfortunately, Larsson never detailed them.  Anyway, a good portion of these nagging questions were answered and I was left fulfilled...only to open a few more though :)  Hopefully the third (already on order) will tie everything together in a nice little package for me!<br /><br />Overall, I gave this a 5-star review because I truly did enjoy everything about it.  I guess if I had to pick one thing that left me feeling empty was the ending, or maybe better stated: left me wanting more.  You'll just have to read the book to find out why.<br /><br />Enjoy!!the ending, or maybe better stated: left me wanting more.  You'll just have to read the book to find out why.      Enjoy!!
0316044938|5.0|I made sure to see the movie for this novel first. I absolutely adored the movie and after finishing the book, I feel that Jackson did for the Lovely Bones what he did for Lord of the Rings. He kept as close to the book as possible without making the movie excessively long. He took creative liberties but overall, it kept the same tone.    I loved the book. I have never read anything quite like it. Grief and loss from a parent's perspective through the eyes of a child. The mental processes of a serial killer. How families move on and cope with loss. Flaws and passions and everything in between.     This book was phenomenally well written (after submitting this review, I intend to go look into Alice Sebold's other works) and unlike anything I have ever read before. I would recommend it for young adults to see it through the eyes of a teen denied the chance to grow up. I would recommend it to people who want another creative interpretation of the afterlife. I recommend it to people trying to deal with loss and grief, I recommend it to people who just have a passion for reading and are looking for something new and unique.
0312360258|2.0|Just because the main character is a teenage girl does not mean the author's have to write like one.   I was disappointed with the story line, the writing and the main character. I had to force myself to read this book and if it were not for the supporting character's and the small attempt at a plot, I would have never finished.  The ending of the book was pathetic but it left some hope for more interesting twists in the future books.   Also, expect to be offended countless times while in Zoey Redbird's thoughts. The author's did a great job of taking low blows at most of their readers.

B002U33GUQ|5.0|I usually do not review a product and other people said everything about this album, so I know there is no need for me to review it, but I just wanted to say thanks to Brad Mehldau and all the people who worked for this album.  If you are already aware that this album features orchestra, you should go ahead and buy it right now, even if you have to cut down on other spending. You will not regret it.  If I were to chose one CD that's allowed to take with me to the space or anywhere, I will definitely pick this one with no hesitation.  It's so good. I will recommend to anyone even who does not listen to jazz nor classical music.    Thanks for sharing this with us Brad.
B00275EGX8|2.0|This movie is repetitive and boring. The same cowboy (Jeremy Renner) rushes in where wise men never tread to dismantle bombs, dismantle people, and dismantle our time. All the characters are one-dimensional. The story does not have any redeeming social value. There is no rhyme or reason; there is just a bunch of explosions and more explosions and more explosions.<br /><br />They did borrow a tad from \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" by sending the dissenbomer home to an environment that did not understand him.<br /><br />I would give you more details about the film but that is all there is. Okay takes place in Iraq 2004.<br />Actual filming Locations are \\"Amman, Jordan\\", \\"Kuwait\\", and \\"Langley, British Columbia, Canada.\\"<br /><br />The Blu-ray has a voice over commentary. This explains why this looks like one long commercial for a film by people that were just reporters.
0393072231|5.0|Economics is a social science. It is predicated on an understanding of human behavior, among other things. It's also recognition that what we think we know may be incorrect. In their recent book, From Poverty To Prosperity - Intangible Assets, Hidden Liabilities and the Lasting Triumph Over Scarcity, Nick Schulz and Arnold Kling posed the following question to Douglass North, Nobel Laureate in Economics (1993). North is the Spencer T. Olin Professor in Arts and Science at Washington University in St. Louis:<br /><br />Here's the question from Schulz and King: \\"What other obstacles prevent economists and policymakers from seeing what really matters?\\"<br /><br />North's response: \\"Until they understand that our understanding of the world is very fragmentary, is not complete, is - I believe - partially incorrect, no matter how intelligent we are, we're not going to make sense of the world.\\" p. 151.<br /><br />We live in a world where we must listen for the voices of dissent - the contrarians. When Michael Lewis' The Big Short was delivered, I thought I might pick it up and read a few pages. Warning: This magnificent work is crafted in such a way that sampling the first few pages will transform your day (as it did mine) into devouring this masterpiece cover-to-cover. It is a book about the dissenters, the contrarians, \\"the few who truly knew\\" - who developed and exercised the foresight to comprehend the emerging financial crisis in the U.S. (and around the globe). It is a story from the perspective of a very few who recognized that \\"a great nation lost its financial mind.\\" P. xiv<br /><br />As Lewis writes:<br /><br />\\"A smaller number of people - more than ten, fewer than twenty, made a straightforward bet against the entire multi-trillion-dollar, sub-prime  mortgage market and, by extension, the global financial system. In and of itself it was a remarkable fact: The catastrophe was foreseeable, yet only a handful noticed.\\" P. 105<br /><br />\\"Even as late as the summer of 2006, as home prices began to fall, it took a certain kind of person to see the ugly facts and react to them - to discern, in the profile of the beautiful young lady, the face of an old witch. Each of these people told you something about the state of the financial system, in the same way that people who survive a plane crash told you something about the accident, and also about the nature of people who survive accidents - all of them were, almost by definition, odd. But they were not all odd in the same way.\\" P. 107<br /><br />This book is incredibly insightful regarding the motivation of homo sapiens in a capitalist society, how we think, what we overlook, and the necessity to learn to question the world around us. Consider the following excerpts from this book:<br /><br />\\"All shared a distinction: They had proven far less capable of grasping basic truths in the heart of the U.S. financial system than a one-eyed money manager with Asperger's syndrome.\\" Lewis' commentary on the failure of foresight by Paulson, Geithner, Bernanke, Blankfein (Goldman Sachs), Mack (Morgan Stanley), and Pandit (Citigroup) vs. hedgefund manager Michael Burry of Cupertino, CA P. 260.<br /><br />\\"I hated discussing ideas with investors,\\" he said, \\"because I then become a Defender of the Idea, and that influences your thought process.\\" Once you became an idea's defender you had a harder time changing your mind about it. P. 56 - quote from Michael Burry.<br /><br />\\"In retrospect, their ignorance seems incredible - but, then, an entire financial system was premised on their not knowing, and paying them for this talent.\\" --- Lewis' characterization on what percentage of credit default swaps were sub-prime. P.88<br /><br />\\"Lippmann soon found that the people he most expected to see the ugly truth of the subprime mortgage market-the people who ran funds that specialized in mortgage bond trading-were the ones least likely to see anything but what they had been seeing for years. Here was astrange but true fact: The closer you were to the market, the harder it was to perceive its folly.\\" P. 91<br /><br />\\"The markets were predisposed to underestimating the likelihood of dramatic change.\\" P.108<br /><br />\\"Just throw your model in the garbage can.

B001UV4XWY|1.0|This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen.  I kept waiting for it to get better but that moment never came.  The movie ended abruptly because the movie never had a plot to begin with and it must ended sometimes; it is one of those endings that you say to yourself.  What the heck was that?  The concept and story is so bad and I can't believe that they actually spent money on it to make such a film.  Bad acting and directing did not help.     Please do NOT see this movie.  You will loose 2.5 hours of your life that you will never get back.  Cameron Diaz career is over after this movie.  For those folks who gave it 5 stars, are you on some kind of meds?
B00337KMAA|3.0|We have seen the two formulas separately. One where the stoic individual that need no one breaks down in the end and even wants to be a part of something; this can be the start of something big. The second formula is firing people or tearing down a company. Waite did not we see this vary same combination in \\"Office Space\\", \\"Cash McCall\\", \\"Pretty Woman\\" etc.<br /><br />So being left without innovation we are left with acting. Hey, wasn't George Clooney great in \\"Solaris\\" (2002) where he showed emotion or \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" (2001) where he showed action, now we get cardboard.<br /><br />We start from nowhere go to nowhere. Moreover, do nothing. The only redeeming social value was the lady (Vera Farmiga) wearing the tie; now that was class.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare. However, the voice over commentary helps you figure out what the purpose of the film was.
0688172377|5.0|An emotional trip of a woman from the desert of Somalia to the United Nations. I will not follow that road which is detailed and marked by exploitation, scarification, mutilation, alienation, rejection, and all other words in that line rhyming with immigration. The film is dealing with one day in the life of an Africa woman that changed that very life into an ordeal. It is called excision and it is performed at the age of three. Beside the direct death rate, and even the indirect death rate (later when pregnant and wanting to deliver the baby) those who survived are made psychologically inferior and dependent. They are not able to control their lives and to develop the energies that would transform the whole African continent. A tradition coming from Black Africa that was later integrated by Islam when it arrived, though Islam was careful not to spread the practice in the population that did not have that tradition, particularly the Arabs. It is nothing but the survival of an enslaving sexual practice that has to disappear from this earth as fast as possible. Yet we are far from it. Excision, and I will say like all other sexual mutilation, is a crime against humanity, including in the US where 95 per cent of males are circumcised. They have even invented a word for natural: uncircumcised and uncut, which is the barbaric  bigotry of some turned into lexical tyranny.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID
B000TSIK14|5.0|Scorpions really hit the nail on the head with Humanity: Hour I.  I have listened to this album all the way through hundreds of times and it never gets old! Every song is superbly crafted and the lyrical content is brilliant! I really dig the concept of humanity being taken over by the very things it created, but I also feel that the songs don't push that concept very hard.  You aren't going to hear a play by play of the story. The songs are strong and deeply intuitive and are very moving. This album is my favorite album of all time and it is one of the only albums I can listen to over and over and over again, every song! My favorites are \\"Loving Me to Death,\\" \\"We Were Born to Fly,\\" and \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive.\\"  Get this album because it will be the best musical investment you will ever make!

B0007PALZ2|4.0|12 Monkeys is an excellent film that works well in many different areas - science fiction thriller, off-beat love story, semi-noir comedy, etc. -, while superb execution in many general areas pushes it beyond these genres. It thus comes highly recommended not only for fans of these elements but for anyone alive to well-made films.    It quickly becomes clear that director Terry Gilliam made the most of a small budget, not only hiring an impressive talent cadre but also overseeing an ambitious production with large sets, dazzling imagery, and hundreds of extras. His ability to make all the disparate elements coalesce is truly impressive. The sets and special effects are not as flashy as big budget films' but are very creative and extremely well-done. Gilliam's year 2035 is not the usual SF extravaganza but almost daringly bland despite a futuristic sheen; he gives a vivid idea of how society might look if forced underground and in many ways held back but with some technology and intelligence remaining. The cinematography is quite fine throughout, and some of the camera angles are particularly excellent. Paul Buckmaster's score is also up to his usual high standard and used quite effectively.    Perhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise is that the acting is very solid. I was highly skeptical of Bruce Willis taking the lead role in a film with little action, but he does a very admirable job. His role is full of subtlety, at once intimidating and vulnerable; it was certainly his greatest performance up to this point and a major breakout. Much the same can be said of Brad Pitt; though his role is small - much smaller than the advertising suggests -, it is very different from anything he had done before and quite strong. Some take issue with his performance, but this seems to be more a criticism of his character than of his acting. Madeleine Stowe is also exemplary in the lead female role; her performance is again notably nuanced, incorporating everything from academic authority to panic-stricken ambivalence to disguised bimboism. All the minor roles are also well-done.    The real standout, though, is David and Janet Peoples' script, one of the freshest and most invigorating in recent memory. Inspired by a classic French art film and incorporating many other influences and elements, it welds all into a memorable and original whole. The film is on its most obvious level an SF thriller; exciting, entertaining, and engrossing, it can be appreciated in this sense alone. It certainly has the most interesting spin on the time travel paradox in some time, and its future vision is refreshingly unusual. However, the love element is also important; Willis even says he thinks the film is a love story and may well be right. The execution is far from conventional but not without a certain charm and can be strangely moving. There is also a significant comic element to the film overall; it pokes good-natured fun at some SF conventions; wields a sharp satirical blade at psychiatry, professors, extreme animal rights activists, and others; and has a curious dash of black humor that, in the \\"trunk\\" scene at least, even borders on slapstick. Such diversity could easily have been disastrous, but the script's commendable tightness - no doubt helped by Gilliam's strong guiding hand - prevent this. Many films, especially SF thrillers, try to puzzle audiences with plot twists and other tricks only to have it all come together in a devastating ending, but very few succeed so well. The story is told concisely but in a way that keeps us guessing; as in stories by SF great Philip K. Dick, we never quite know what is real and what is not, giving a disarming but pleasing disorientation that draws us in quickly and keeps us interested. The writers deserve special praise for not dumbing-down the story to normally Hollywood standards; this is an intelligent script demanding attention and concentration and that truly rewards repeat viewings. There is also muchto provoke thought about a variety of important issues:  the definition of sanity, the ethics of science, the rights of animals, authority vs. individualism, etc. Finally, we should be thankful that the Peoples did not take the easy way out with the ending; though ultimately triumphant, it is shot through with tragedy and strongly moving.     The associated documentary is noteworthy enough to attract those who have already seen the film - perhaps even those who already own a prior version. It is easily the best \\"Making of\\" I have ever seen. An hour and a half long, it covers every production aspect from initial brainstorming to post-production. Many facets not usually seen - editing, marketing, test screening, etc. - are here in detail. Most fascinating of all is that it has a true behind the scenes feel that is rarely achieved; the principals are unusually open about filming's ups and downs, and their reactions to outside views and pressures are surprisingly candid. The documentary is also a well-made film in itself, entertaining and often funny. It is essential for 12 fans.    All told, anyone looking for a well put together SF film with other attributes - some action, a surprising number of laughs, and even a little romance, plus much to provoke thought - would be hard-pressed to do better than 12.
B00002MZ4V|3.0|I am not going praise how good John Williams is, and how good these masterpieces are, because I am sure if you are reading this, you already know that.    All I want to say is the quality of the recording.  If you are looking for audiophile quality from this CD, you will be dissapointed.  If you are playing this in your home theatre audiophile system, you will be dissapointed with the bland and flat output.    I hope John William will remake this into Bluray (I would like to see his live performance!) and HD quality.  It is about time too.

I'll be happy if running and I can grow old together\\" (172).<br /><br />When we discovered that we were going to Okinawa, Wendy suggested one of her favorite authors, Haruki Murakami. I never read one of his books until I saw this in the library. Strangely enough, it's about running, a topic I have little interest in reading an entire book about. What compelled me to read something from him was the fact that he translated Raymond Carver's short stories into Japanese. In fact, I thought he ripped off Carver's title, What We Talk about When We Talk about Love, my first Carver collection.<br /><br />This is a memoir of sorts, both of his training for several marathons and his writing process. I enjoyed his ability to use running as a metaphor for writing, and writing as a metaphor for running. Murakami has an easy style of writing without pretension, something that books about writing rarely have.<br /><br />I loved the descriptions of his runs around both Tokyo and Boston best, but I found the most inspiration in his recounting of his run in an ultramarathon (62 miles). That serves as a reminder for me to persevere in my Christian faith and to pursue Jesus as the ultimate prize.<br /><br />\\"Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it\\" (1 Cor. 9:24).
B0012GMVDK|2.0|This album, surprisingly enough, has received numerous accolades from other Amazon reviewers.  I have read some of them and have to politely disagree with anyone who says this album is among his best.  First off the album has an economy of tracks.  Of the fewer than 10 tracks, 2 are covers.  Always is an Irving Berlin cover that absolutely drags and goes on forever without much sense of life or melody.  Be For Real is a more melodic song but not exactly inspiring.  If I wanted to hear Barry White \\"in the mood\\" music, I'd listent to Barry White.  Cohen goes out of his realm here and fails.  As if he wants to leave nothing to the imagination, he ends with the over the top line \\"I don't give a damn about the truth baby, except the naked truth.\\"  Here we have a man who has gotten a reputation for being a ladies man trying way too hard to live up to that reputation.  Silly.  From there we can move on to something that should never appear on any Leonard Cohen album- an instrumental.  Cohen is an amazing songwriter but he is NOT a musician's musician.  Tacoma Trailer, the instrumental in question, is slow synthesizer music that if I'm not mistaken is actually played or composed by SOMEONE ELSE.  What's the point?  So now we're down to the  songs Cohen wrote and sang.  Those would be The Future, a mediocre song with a pretty good refrain that simply isn't interesting enough to stand the test of time.  Waiting For the Miracle, a cousin to Everybody Knows, is possibly darker and more hypnotic.  Beautiful song with interesting lyrics and great instrumentation and melody.  Definitely the standout track on the album.  Anthem, yet another standout track with a much different feel that is more hopeful.  Light As the Breeze, Democracy and Closing Time are all functional songs   that when done by others (billy joel has covered Light as the breeze and Don Henley has covered Democracy) get a new boost of energy.  With that said, I've come to appreciate Cohen's sedate delivery of thesetunes.  The version of Closing Time that appears on Cohen Live in London is far superior to this album's version due to a huge boost of energy from the touring band.    Overall, Cohen sounds like he's asleep throughout this album.  Ten New Songs (the follow up album to the Future) is a far superior record in songwriting, delivery, lyrics, groove and melody.  Don't waste your money on this one.  For someone who has traveled to Montreal just to find the poetry of Cohen at used book stores and see where he grew up, that's not an easy thing to say.
B00004YZFR|3.0|I bought this used for about half price and I'm sure that's why it sticks on the commentary feature and won't budge when I play it on my TV. Hence, the title of my review. It works ok on my computer, though.<br /><br />The liner notes for this product are the best part.  A lot of information from all sides involved illuminate a chaotic, seemingly one sided situation.  It also provided insight into the crap shoot unpredictability of touring with even the most famous rock band of the day before the information revolution provided cell phones and the internet.<br /><br />The movie itself is much more boring then I remember.  It only gets interesting when they get to Altamont.  The concert footage is great but too scarce, especially from the Madison Square Garden show.  The negotiations for Altamont are more interesting then watching the band hang out.<br /><br />In closing: Not Amazon's fault, but I would only recommend this if you're a Stones fan.  Like most of the Rolling Stones' products, it's overpriced.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|This is a the rip-off edition of the Blu-ray. It has absolutely no special features, and is missing the additional footage being added to the film.

1416550542|5.0|Sigh. If only real-life genealogy was like this . . .    This epic novel is about a genealogical mystery. In 1913, a four-year-old girl was found alone on a wharf in Australia, having arrived by ship from London. She says she doesn't remember her name. You might think that a little girl alone on a ship isn't realistic, but the book explains the chain of events in such a way that it makes perfect sense.    The wharf worker who found her called her \\"Nell\\", and he and his wife raised her as their own. Only at Nell's 21st birthday does her \\"father\\" reveal the truth about her origins. It changes her life, but she keeps the secret.    In 2005, after Nell's death, her granddaughter Cassandra discovers the secret. She embarks on a search to discover who Nell really was, and how she came to be abandoned on an Australian wharf. Along the way, she learns that Nell had also tried to find the same answers to the mystery of her origins.    The story jumps around back and forth between the early 1900's (the story of the mysterious woman Nell vaguely remembered as \\"The Authoress\\"), the 1970's (Nell's search for her birth family), and 2005 (Cassandra's investigation into the mystery.) But each section is clearly labeled at the start, so there is no confusion. It also helps (and enhances the interest) that each section is closely correlated with the others - each chronology concerns the same events and clues. You read about something that happened in the early 1900's just as Nell (in the 1970's) and Cassandra (in 2005) are discovering clues about that particular event.    It is a great story, with all the fascination of real-life genealogy but with the additional satisfaction of eventually finding all the answers - something that rarely happens in real life. And not only do we get to know the answers, but we also come to know each of the people involved intimately, their personalities and their feelings. The reader is omniscient: unlike Cassandra and Nell, we don't just uncover the facts, but are able to watch the entire story unfold through the narration of the earlier events. It is so very satisfying - if only I could really know my own ancestors and what happened in their lives, like this!    I did figure out the answer to the mystery fairly early in the book, but not the reason why. I had a theory - and a backup one - and neither one were right!    The characters are thoroughly developed, the plot is a real page-turner, the settings so alive, and the ending so satisfying: neatly tying up all the loose ends but retaining the poignancy of the story. This is a moving and perfect novel. Even at this length, I didn't want it to end.    (552 pages)
1592402690|5.0|READ THIS BOOK if you want to understand more about the music and the studio recordings of The Beatles. You will feel like you were there in the studio during the most important sessions of their careers. It will change the way you look at The Beatles, both as individuals and as the greatest popular music phenomenon of all time.    This is a book that describes events in the studio. It is not a memoir outside of that environment, but it gives interesting insight into the personalities of the four musicians who came into that studio, wrote the music, developed the arrangements, created the sounds, captured the performances, enhanced the sounds, and otherwise contributed in one way or another to the magic of those recordings. You will learn more about who and what drove the group, how they interacted, and what contributions others such as the author and George Martin may (or may not) have made to those recordings.    The Beatles were driven to do things that had never been done before; they were always pushing the envelope. They eventually turned to creating music that could be created no other way than in the studio, and they pushed the envelope there as well. The author was a key player in these recording sessions; he helped them to capture sounds that led to such masterpieces as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.    Those of us who played their music, followed their careers, and listened intently to their recordings once they left touring behind and moved into the studio will want to read this book to get a glimpse of what it was like to have been there and witnessed their artistry in the studio.

0810993139|4.0|Eleven-year-old Greg Heffley knows he's going places. unfortunately, to get there he has to pass through middle school--that cruel, no man's land where everyone is mashed together irrespective of maturity. What diabolical mind created this strange limbo where kids who haven't had their growth spurt mingle daily with giants who shave twice a day?<br /><br />Not to worry, Greg has figured out most of the ins and outs of surviving middle school already. The key lies in walking that fine line between keeping a low profile and earning the school's admiration as one of the Yearbook Favorites. Now if only Greg could get his best friend Rowley on board with his grand plan to put the cool into middle school in Diary of a Wimpy Kid (2007) by Jeff Kinney.<br /><br />To call Greg self-centered would be an understatement. He is one of the most self-absorbed characters I have ever read. And yet, as is the way, Greg does have a certain charm. His daily trials and tribulations are also quite funny.<br /><br />As a character Greg is one of those anomalies--not quite bad enough to be a villain but not always nice enough to warrant his spot as protagonist. Although they would probably attract two very different audiences, Diary of a Wimpy Kid reminded me a lot of Louise Rennison's Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging. Georgia Nicholson, like Greg, is one of the most self-centered characters I have ever encountered. But, and perhaps this is a credit to the respective authors, it kind of works. I'm waiting for the day I find a cross-over fan fiction where Greg's family moves to England when he is a bit older and he and Georgia meet and start to date. It's a match made in heaven. Can anyone else hear the tinkling sound of wedding bells?<br /><br />The book is a fast read and, honestly, popular enough with kids and parents that I don't really need to say anything else about it. A blend of cartoons and narrative, this is one of those books that sells itself.<br /><br />As if this book series wasn't popular enough, there is also a movie version. Diary of a Wimpy Kid came out on March 19 and I was, amazingly, one of the people who saw it on opening day (this never happens). I wasn't over the moon about the book, but it was kind of fun.<br /><br />I'm over the moon about the movie.<br /><br />The idea of a novel in cartoons being recreated as a live action movie is worrisome at best, but in this case, it works really really unbelievably well. Director Thor Freudenthal blends the actors and live action of the film almost seamlessly with integrated snippets of Kinney's original art brought to life in animated form.<br /><br />The actors themselves were also fabulous. Unsurprisingly, a lot of the cast consists of children. Talented actor children who I fully expect to be going places when they get older. Zachary Gordon and Robert Capron really brought Greg and Rowley to life.<br /><br />The movie also added a different spin to a lot of events in the book--it removed some of the hard edges (and hard knocks) from Greg's story in a way that ultimately made the story tighter. The actors also made a lot of characters that fell flat on the page more dimensional and approachable for me. Steve Zahn was a kinder, gentler father than the one we see in the book. Similarly Devon Bostick was kind of brilliant as Greg's villainous older brother Rodrick. His exploits and tricks are so much funnier (and more diabolical) in the movie than they were in the book.<br /><br />Call me crazy, but this might be the movie that turns out to be better than the book.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Al Capone Shines My Shoes by Gennifer Choldenko, Neil Armstrong Is My Uncle & Other Lies Muscle Man McGinty Told Me by Nan Marino, The Mostly True Adventures of Homer P.

B002XMGGJM|4.0|This was very entertaining to see how it would end. You are surprised at almost every move. Quite violent though.
B002M9WW30|4.0|Five stars for the movies, yet for being a special collection, I was hoping for more bonus features. The bonus disc that comes with it is nice, but there are no bonus features on Rocky 1-5, not even audio commentary. Oh well, still great movies and I got them for dirt cheap. Gotta love Rocky!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|After watching the 1st season we immediately ordered the 2nd.  We were not disappointed!  The second season was also full of laughs and you really get to know the characters even more.  If you loved the 1st season you will be equally pleased with season 2!
B001OQCV6K|4.0|I grew up in a film family, my father worked for MTM productions for years, he started with Gunsmoke,and retired on Sister, Sister, and worked on several movies and television shows in between, so I would say that I am very critical when it comes to movies.  I loved this movie.  I watch a lot of English movies and I really enjoyed this, I thought that Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law did a excellent job.  I am a very young grand mother , but only go to the movies that peak my interest and this movie was one of them.  I liked the point that Sherlock Holmes used his brain a lot in the movie and that Dr. Watson was a faithful side kick, and as for using his gun he did shot it twice in the movie, for that person who fell asleep in the movies 5 times; and don't remember if Watson shot the gun or not.  I also loved the theme music and feel that Guy Richie did a good job as a director. I would not say that is one of the the best movies that I have ever watched but it was a good movie and I would recommend it to others.  The movie did very well at the box office and I hope that a sequel is made, for I would go and watch it again.

B002XZ62HK|5.0|Thanks PBS, for introducing CW to me. Even with personnel changes, CW continues on with stellar performences by the group and individual solo numbers as well. To really understand the groups' success, one must listen to the individual solo CDs to find the magic of the group. Lynn Hilary is an able replacement for Orla Fallon who's now on her own, but not forgotten. A personal note - get the DVD as well. Due to CD capacity limits, you miss five of the concert tracks that are on the DVD.
0385504225|3.0|My Thoughts:<br /><br />Okay now that you know what Daphne Durham from Amazon.com thought of this book I will give you a little bit of what I thought about Dan Brown's newest book. I want to set up a disclaimer right of the bat, I didn't read the other two books by Mr. Brown, I watched their movie equivalent. That is an important piece of information as I may have not a full outlook on how this series has gone.<br /><br />I titled this post exactly how I felt about the story. IT WAS A GOOD STORY, however, it was very easy to figure out if you paid halfway attention to it. Maybe that is Mr. Brown's skill, he makes you fell like his main character. Even if you aren't highly educated or super smart you fell that way reading a Dan Brown Novel (or watching it as a movie).<br /><br />I wanted this book to be mystical, I wanted Dan Brown to finally reveal that the magic stuff in his stories is real...I was let down again. Especially in the last film we are pulled along a path that makes you think...wow he really is going to embrace the supernatural - and then bam! He brings you back to a logical and reasonable world. That is a fun thing, but I really wanted him to let that go with this story.<br /><br />I wanted the main villain to be a supernatural character, he wasn't. The bad thing is that it didn't take long to figure that out. That is where this book falls apart for me, the fine line of feeling smart but not know what is going to happen next (a perfect thriller feeling) didn't happen. I knew that the main villain was the son, it just made sense. I apologize already  for those of you that didn't figure it out...but it was pretty apparent.<br /><br />Good things - I loved the Washington D.C. material, learning about all the ins and out of the capital was simply fascinating. If Dan Brown just wrote non-fiction history books...he would still be very successful. I think he should do that, I really do. Dan Brown, if your listening, cross over to the non-fiction side. Sure there isn't as much money involved...but you have made your fortune.<br /><br />I found the story enjoyable in \\"The Lost Symbol\\" but I this isn't amazing material. It is entertainment, and Mr. Brown does a great job of that.

B001OQCV2O|1.0|I liked the other movies from Roland Emmerich and was hoping to see something exciting with great visual effects.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was boring, predictable, the actors were really bad and the special effects looked as if they were made 15 years ago. When the ground is initially separating behind somebody running, then behind a car driving, then behind a plane taking off, this is seriously getting old. Some special effects were great, the vast majority so bad though that you immediately thought about the green room these scenes were taken in. Planes that after takeoff do not gain altitude, but drop a few thousand feets, then fly maneuvers that physically would not be possible, the scale of the model used does not match the environment and so on ...<br /><br />For me this was the worst movie I have seen in the last 2-3 years, not worth the money, but maybe for younger kids that do not have a lot of comparison, it might be an O.K. movie.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|As a HUGE fan of BBC and of nature, I have to say that I am offended that they would choose somebody like Oprah to narrate this. I can understand why they do a U.S. version, but come on!!! They could have chosen anyone! I hope more people complain, so that their next show won't be narrated by Jerry Springer! Buy the UK version, David Attenborough is the best in the biz.
B000AP04MO|3.0|Interesting period cars.  Interesting European scenery.  Plot and pace drags a little but presence of fine actors salvages the situation.  I did not care for the continual shifting of scenes from now to then and back.  Not one of Audrey Hepburn's best.  Of course, Albert Finney has always been a little difficult for me to like.  But, he got to do a lot of love scenes with Audrey, and that ain't bad!  Overall, not too bad but not as good as I was expecting.
1590171993|5.0|Every time I want to really knock someone out, really level them, I recommend this book.  I can't tell you how many times people have thanked me for having recommended Stoner.  I've now read every book by Williams, and though they're all superb, this one really does exist in that elite galaxy alongside Anna Karenina and Swann's Way.  Read it or don't, I don't care--I'm just glad to know that I have.
B000VBP382|5.0|I have all 3 renditions of this fine book. They are all slightly different versions but this one is far more detailed and very romantic. I think anyone who likes this story will also enjoy this particular version.
0307266303|5.0|I've been running since I was 12 and chubby. Running not only helped me get in shape, but it gave me a place of my own and some peace in a chaotic life. And in the years since, I've gone through periods of running and not running, but never really thought it was something I really did. I was almost apologetic about it. I'm a weightlifter and a jock, not a runner. Running was just something I did to stay in shape for other things, and always with the awareness that I was just asking for injury by doing so.<br /><br />Then I read this book. It was like reading something of my own story. And the stories of runners, mythical, real, and somewhere in-between. The story pulled me in so hard that I read it cover-to-cover in one afternoon at a bookstore (despite the fact that I already bought and downloaded it to my Kindle... it just needed old-fashioned reading). And now I'm back running because I understand that is quite literally what I am born to do.<br /><br />If you have ever wanted to truly ENJOY running, read this book.
0385504225|3.0|All due respect to Dan Brown and fellow readers, I must say that while I was excited to read his latest book, I found myself extremely disappointed about half-way through.  It wasn't that the book was poorly written (though I must agree with other reviewers that certain elements were extraneous), but rather that the story felt suspiciously familiar:  I'm sure many will remember the Bruckheimer blockbuster \\"National Treasure\\" that all but tells the same story--though, in my opinion? Theirs was better.    On the whole, the book was very interesting.  Brown did a great job of introducing mass numbers of readers to a newer field of science that is unlikely to be commonly known and, as some others have said: good for him for spawning the thousands of subsequent Google searches.  However, for all the elements that are individual to the novel, the story was far too predictable for my taste, and, as I said earlier: far too close to \\"National Treasure.\\"  Don't get me wrong, mostly--I enjoyed the book.  I got a little bogged down in certain areas because the book tended to drag along--but mostly, it was very fascinating historical material that did its job in making me curious enough to keep reading (that and, after paying so much for a hardback, I was certainly going to finish the thing).  But the formula felt desperate--it seemed to follow almost the exact general idea of \\"National Treasure\\", though the specifics were different.  The characters are in DC, searching for some great mythological 'treasure' and there's a token bad guy desperate to beat them to it.  While that summary is extremely generalized, if I were to go into detail it would get boring.      Basically, I found the book good up until about half way through when I realized I could already see the exact path it was going to take.  Even the scenes of suspense were simple enough to guess how they would play out, and some even felt desperately contrived (ie: Langdon's \\"experience\\" at the end--not to give anythingaway).  I give Brown major points for turning out what is considered a bestseller with such pressure after two previous hits (especially after the success of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\")--but I think there was too much pressure on him to create a book of the same caliber, and in the end I found this to be far below the bar set for it.  It wasn't a horrible book by any means--it was entertaining enough and paced well enough that I got through it.  Plus, I give him credit for delving into dark details that would likely make a lot of people uncomfortable. I won't lie: there were parts of that book that just plain creeped me out--but that was the nature of the subject material he was investigating and I have to give him props for being willing to go there knowing the type of fan-base he'd have reading the novel.  Also: to start the action with a severed hand?  That's brave.  It wasn't just some hand--it was the hand of a character you'd already been introduced to and predisposed to feel compassion for.  For this and similar elements, I was hoping the book would have the same feel of academic adventure as the previous two--but in the end, I felt as if the plot were pushing an agenda (not unlike Da Vinci Code) and the whole last third of the book was not too difficult to dissect and predict.  Now, that is not likely a typcial result for readers, and again: no offense to those who praise this as a work of literary brilliance--but simply for my own opinion?  I'd much rather sit and watch Bruckheimer's film every day than ever read this book again, and I sincerely hope that this novel has not already been offered a film contract because I truly think the stories would be far too similar for it to be properly enjoyed.
B002VWNICW|5.0|... so its not really that kind of movie, but its very good. I've not read the book so evaluating the movie on its own merits. Beautiful in hi-def, romantic, funny, fabulous score, great cast, great dialogue. Like nothing I've ever seen. I saw it on TV first in 4:3 SD but does not do it justice. As at least one reviewer has mentioned, the rapidity and manner of speaking is, in a few places, hard to grasp. The \\"rejection scene\\" between Lizzie and Mr Darcy was particularly troublesome for me, but the subtitles and pause helped. Kept me captivated throughout. Many great scenes, e.g. the scene near the end which begins with Lizzie noticing Mr Darcy walking towards her in the field. Fabulous movie... even for this guy.

B002Y5FKUE|5.0|What do you do with a cockamamie plot, deplorable lyrics, and beautiful music. One solution is to hire two of the best star singers around, surround them with top notch support, and .....well, take your best shot on everything else. Obviously, in today's world this should be played as a comic opera, a bedroom farce with music, a full scale camp outing with today's Marx Brothers (or even the Ritz Brothers, Laurel and Hardy or the Three Stooges). I suppose the dream of any director is to have the funds to hire the right people to redo the book and the lyrics, keeping only the music. None of that is  yet to be. The Director of this production, imported from Hollywood, I think I saw some place, had a pretty good idea (borrowed from Kiss Me Kate and who knows how many other star vehicles). Put it in a rehearsal hall, modern dress, and let it be a play within a play. Personally, the setting worked for me as did the costuming, in rehearsal clothes, of the cast. What somehow got out of hand, not just a little bit but completely, was the creation of the play within a play and the play itself. For reasons beyond me, the two merged with no perceptible difference between them beyond the first part of the first act. Perhaps the next time (and, unlikely it will be at the Met, given the reception by the audience), someone will do a better job, perhaps, a complex, multi-talented artist, like William Kentridge, designer and director of the now current (as I write) production of The Nose, also at the Met. Both it, and his earlier production of The Magic Flute, are the work of a highly creative guy who is not afraid to take the plunge into \\"way out\\".  Given my qualifications with regard to the production, why 5 Stars. Simple. It was quite entertaining once I got the hang of it. These two singers can and do make an evening regardless of difficulties with the plot. Opera is still 90 % song and music.   (Whispered aside to the one sitting in the next seat, at the Met, with you: \\"Who on earth, today, would believe other than that both woman slept with The Count.)
0547258305|4.0|I found Katsa to be a very interesting character. Her growth in her personal life as well as with her Grace was what really made the novel work for me. I truly loved all of the characters and felt for them as they suffered through their own struggles.<br /><br />Po's issues effected me harder than I would have imagined. What he deals with towards the end of the book was uncomfortable for him and I physically felt that discomfort. I was annoyed until I realized that it wasn't the story line that was bothering me, but the fact that he was so unhappy. That right there blew me away. Writing that gets under your skin in such a way is very hard to find.<br /><br />The world Kristin Cashore created is vast and filled with vivid imagery that makes it possible to envision the kingdoms with ease. I really enjoyed Graceling and will be reading the prequel/companion novel Fire in the future.
1416594787|5.0|Fantastic book!  It discusses the evidence for evolution on a \\"popular science\\" level that almost any reader can grasp.  My only complaint is his numerous literary references that many readers *won't* get.  Other than that, the book is sound, interesting, and covers the topic pretty thoroughly.  I fear that the audience that the book was written for may never pick it up, but I hope that it (or something like it) will become required reading in high school biology classes in the future.
B0034BW9CO|5.0|Every so often an artist or group comes along that redefines bachata.  Monchy y Alexandra, Aventura, Xtreme, and now Prince Royce.  While his debut album is only 10 tracks deep, it's amazing from start to finish.<br /><br />Xtreme has more of an R&B edge to their music, whereas Royce adds some pop and R&B flavor both to his songs.  This Bronx Dominicano writes all of his own lyrics, and the music production is as perfect as a plate of abuelita's mofongo.  Even though his Spanglish cover of \\"Stand By Me\\" was the chart-topper, I think the rest of his tracks are even more amazing.<br /><br />If songs like Hoja en Blanco moved you, Royce's \\"Mi Ultima Carta\\" will have the same impact.  The standout track on the album for me is the love-is-blind themed \\"Corazon Sin Cara\\", a throwback to Anthony Santos singing Obsesion on the smash 2002 Aventura album.  I also predict that Rechazame is destined to become a club favorite.  If you dig songs like \\"Tempted to Touch\\" by Rupee, then the album's English tracks like \\"Crazy\\" will appeal to you.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to listen to this CD without dancing.  If you love bachata as much as I do, treat yourself today and buy this album.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I you are a CAD designer & have not tried any of the 3Dconnexion products...what are you waiting for.  I migrated from a SpaceBall 4000 to the SpaceNagigator & love it.  I opted for the SpaceNavigator because I didn't use the bottons on my SpaceBall, so why spend the extra money for features I wouldn't use.  The SpaceNavigator handles a little differently than the SpaceBall, but I got used to it pretty quickly.  If you want to increase productivity & flexibility while designing you need a 3D mouse.  They take a bit to get used to, but you can adjust the sensitivity of the puck until you get used to it & then gradually increase it until it fits your style.    The SpaceNavigator is very heavy & stays put during use.  I also like the small footprint so it gives me more room on my desk top.  What more can I say, except this is a must have for every CAD designer.

0812973992|1.0|I hate this book and those boring Irish brothers. The author was trying way too hard to create eccentric characters but I found the whole thing to be totally ridiculous and the characters to be so annoying I never want to encounter any of them again. I wanted to stop out of the gate but there were so many great reviews I persevered assuming I was missing something that would soon reveal itself. I know that \\"persevere\\" seems like a strong word to use given I only made it to page 55 but it took sheer will to do so - then I set it aside hoping to gain the strength for a second round but that's not going to happen. Dave Eggers, whose writing I respect, gives a glowing review on the cover of Let The Great World Spin. How is it possible? I've considered never buying another Eggers book on principle. This is among the worst books I've ever almost read.
1400052173|4.0|A an extremely interesting story and well-researched.  My problem is with the author who made me feel at times like I was reading a high school essay. The book became tedious for me at times and while I was very fascinated with Henrietta Lacks I found the in depth conversations between the author and her family members quite pointless and rambling.
0684800713|5.0|Read this book many years ago, and still love it.  Someone once told me I reminded them of Brett (of course, ran out immediately & bought to read).  I think I was 19, but just loved & about time to read again.

B001IHJ97E|4.0|DVD review: I understand why part of this film is one aspect ratio and why the other part is another; I get that!  So, film purists, don't attack me;  I was singing praises of preserving a film's aspect ratio and bought letterboxed laserdiscs before dvd back in the early 90s when some of you were kids watching Home Alone movies with your mamas.  And on a theater screen the explosion of the wider screen brainstorm scenes may have been impressive. But at home most of the film is puny and windowboxed and it is annoying. I have hung onto my 2000 dvd with the constant aspect ratio and hope that in the future a bigger, better special edition dvd will be released. It should contain two versions: one for the purists and one with a constant widescreen for heathens like me, and it should be chock full of extras including commentary and deleted scenes and a gag reel (Walken must be precious and priceless in those outtakes) and making of documentary. The history of this movie is even more fascinating than the movie itself and there is so much to be explained, from Wood's death to the special effects, etc etc. It's an insult to keep re-releasing this and offer nothing but a change in aspect ratios.     Film review: Brainstorm is not a major classic but an underrated early 80s gem with a climax that does disappoint, I'm afraid. Still, the rest of the film is compelling, it's a fascinating premise, and all of the leads are solid. I'm a huge lifelong Christopher Walken fan and he is as always stunning to watch, but I have to be objective and say that he may have been upstaged by Fletcher in this. She may have an Oscar, but she is tragically underrated and deserved another one for this. I first saw her heart attack scene when I was little and never forget it. Thanks to her, I never smoked.

B000A0GXGA|5.0|True genius of early TV (1950s & 1970s).  MAVERICK was probably the best \\"adult western\\" ever made...Neil Simon-like satire in every script and Garner's instantly accessible blend of brilliant con man, coward, and virtuous soul made them classics.  Twenty years later, Roy Huggins, Garner's MAVERICK collaborator, repeated their lightning-in-a-bottle trick for the P.I. genre in THE ROCKFORD FILES.    Ranks with THE HONEYMOONERS at the top of the TV heap!
B0000025KI|4.0|This is ok, it is Bruce shortly after his early peak. His poetry is strong enough, the visuals sometimes compelling, sometimes lame. The band is healthy, the quality is good, but. Truly there are only a couple of tunes on the whole thing that work for me.  I'm not sure if the packaging is early pretense or what- nice enough, but kind of a 'so what?' set other than those few strong songs, regardless of what made the air play back when released.   I guess New Joizey rock is ok, but I'm a Texas rocker, so my viewpoint is obviously skewed.  Might be worthwhile for a Bruce nut, but cherry pick from iTunes or something if you just need those couple songs...
074322454X|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much.  It is very well written and provides a level of detail not available in the HBO series (although I enjoyed that too).  Anyone interested in the 101st Airborne during WWII would be happy with this account.
044654146X|5.0|Through the recent availability of venture capital and the utilisation of the capabilities of IDF personnel, Israel has begun to establish a viable economy, based on innovation in new lines of technology.  This accomplishment is further bolstered by the Israeli culture, which, in general, is distinct to the region and the rest of the world due to its lack of social hierarchy and willingness to tolerate challenge to authority.     That said, because of the focus on skills obtained in the IDF, and with venture capital directed towards  a limited variety of options, the economy is in danger of being akin to a wagon with only one star to hitch to, and overburdened with the Haredi and Israeli Arabs who are often excluded from participating in the economy because of their own actions, or because they have skills and qualifications, but lack the professional and social networks that IDF personnel have developed and have access to. So it is essential for Israel to develop the means that will enable Israeli Arabs and Haredi to gain the skills they do not gain in the IDF, and for IDF personnel who have not had to test their abilities on the battlefield.  Hard to believe, I know, but not all of the IDF are fighting all of the time :-)     The Science of Success by Charles G. Koch, and The Puritan Gift and William and Kenneth Hopper, may be useful sources of inspiration for Israel, and for those keen to emulate Israel's success.
B001UV4XWY|4.0|Where exactly R. Kelly comes up with the ideas (both intellectual and visual) for his assortment of works can probably best be explained as being those of his \\"employers.\\" This is a tricky film, much more accessable to the average moviegoer (heaven forbid my saying that) and yet it is truely subversive. Who would have thought that the ramifications of moral choice could be wrapped in such an enigmatic piece of \\"entertainment\\" (to use the old cinema dichotomy of art vs.)?    Maybe that is the problem with many of the reviewers who gave negative opinions of this film (two to one). The message (old as the most ancient religious texts) is too simple, or from the opposite extreme, it was simply too difficult for an \\"average audience\\" to pick from the stunning visual imagry. Regardless, it is well worth seeing and a new twist on Kelly's expanding ouvre. I have nothing but respect for an auteur who understands that at least some in the audience have a brain and imagination of their own and the ability to utilize both. Bravo.
0385338910|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and read it in a day.  The author did a fantastic job of individualizing each character.  Their voices and nuances were different and I loved each of them, especially the father.  The novel is funny and not at all morose, considering the subject matter.  A truly heartwarming read of a few months in the life of one crazy family.
1567184855|1.0|I think this book is another victim of \\"PhD found good money idea and went with it\\". Its not that there is no validity to anything said, its that there is so little credibility to most of it that it does a major disservice to many in the field who have strived to do actual research on the topic of reincarnation.<br /><br />Nobody incarnates in Canada and the US at the same time. Nobody is a \\"we\\" inhabiting multiple bodies. So many things about this book make you raise your eyebrows if you are a scientist or critical thinker.<br /><br />If you really have an interest in real research done by scientists regarding reincarnation read the works of Brian Weiss and also study the decades of work done at The University Of Virginia by Dr Ian Stevenson.

B001NXBRJG|5.0|The Matrix is basically the Star Wars of this generation, a science fiction movie so profound and visually appealing that even a decade later nothing else has come close (Avatar looked great, but even its fans agree that it had a fairly unoriginal story). It's telling of our society that it took 20 years for the Star Wars trilogy to be tarnished by its sequels, yet The Matrix sequels came only 4 years later (along with plenty of games and tie-ins). In any case, it was a real treat to see the movie again; even though I'd watched it a couple dozen times before, the last time was a while back and via the original DVD release (which came out in 1999 and still holds up pretty well).<br /><br />I have to admit that the negative reviews regarding the Blu-Ray's picture worried me, but there has to be something else in play there, as I thought the transfer was FANTASTIC. The layers in the foreground and background looked fine to me (and almost 3-dimensional at times). There isn't one second of the movie that isn't razor sharp and crystal clear, and every little detail can be made out, right down to the pores on the actors' faces!<br /><br />Having said that, two scenes did lack perfection to my eye:<br />1 - You've probably heard that the movie was recolored to match the sequels (ie, the scenes in the Matrix have been tinted green). For the most part, this has been integrated well, but in the scene where Mr. Anderson is being chewed out by his boss, I found the sickly green tint on Keanu's face to be overdone and distracting. Thankfully, the rest of the movie didn't suffer from this effect.<br /><br />2 - When Trinity first talks to Neo in the club, her face, shoulders and upper chest (she wears a strapless dress) show some strange image noise, possibly because of the way the scene was lit. This goes away as she approaches Neo to whisper in his ear.<br /><br />This package comes with tons of great extras. My favorite is still the music-only audio track (something I wish more dvds had), as you only really get to hear the subtleties in Davis' score when the dialogue and gunfire is removed. I doubt most people will go through all the commentaries and documentaries, but it's nice to have them there. Collectors will get a lot out of this release.o hear the subtleties in Davis' score when the dialogue and gunfire is removed.

The filmmakers explore fear here in a compelling, genuinely human  at times, even poetic manner. Good movie.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|The first point of this review is actually to let people know that Garmin is offering a (...) rebate on this unit (blue only and 405 non-CX models) if purchased between 2/1/10 and 5/31/10 (...); I only found out about this offer accidentally when price checking on another site.    Now, the actual review - note, this is the first GPS unit for running that I have used, so I don't have any basis for comparison.  I also haven't spent too much time with the unit yet, as I wanted to post the above rebate info asap.    The unit is bulky, but light.  I immediately swapped out the plastic wristband for one of the velcro bands, which is definitely more comfortable.  The touch bezel that seems to be the source of much angst is a little flighty, and I'm still getting used to it.  Controls are not immediately intuitive, but one run through the owner's manual pretty much got me up to speed.  The customizable data fields that display during training are really cool.  No problems pairing with HRM, acquiring GPS satellites, or pairing with ANT.  GPS works as expected.    Two software options are available: Garmin Connect (online) and Garmin Training Center (downloaded from Garmin, installed on your computer).  Training Center offers more detailed information and data tools for analyzing your workouts; however, the website is better with street maps (uses Google Maps), so this may be better if you do a lot of street running in a heavily populated area and you want to keep track of your routes.  You can use either, or both.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|This movie appears at first to be just another crime thriller, but this movie turned out to be much, much more.  Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler are superb actors and are at the top of their game in this movie.  Foxx plays the D.A. that lets Butler's daughter's murderer off with only minimum jail time for cooperation and testimony against the other, lesser guilty accomplice.  That begins a long drawn out and tightly woven \\"cat & mouse\\" chain reaction that leads to Foxx believing Butler is behind an attempt to \\"punish\\" all in involved in the injustice of his daughter's murder.  This movie feels much more like a psychological thriller or something similar to a horror movie like Saw - much more than it feels like a typical crime drama.  The movie Se7en had a very different story line, but at times throughout the movie I was reminded how much that movie and this movie had in common.  Law Abiding Citizen was the \\"sleeper\\" film of 2009 for me, definitely worth watching for fans of the \\"cat & mouse\\" or revenge genres.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|While I'm not a serious audiophile, I wanted better speakers headphones than the default that came with the package (a digital piano).  There IS a difference.  For me, particularly in the low frequencies.  It's also true, as others have noted, that you should set the volume down before listening because it doesn't take much to drive these headphones.  Extremely comfortable and no reason to think they won't last a long time.  Overall, very happy and I appreciate the customer reviews that led me to buy these.

0307271862|3.0|This long and complex story begins following the trek of a lone wolf across the border in the deep stillness of a Swedish winter landscape. I could have read an entire novel based on this wolf's travels, so captivating is the story telling skill of Henning Mankell. Alas, this story closes when the wolf finds a small hamlet in rural Sweden only moments after a gruesome mass murder has occurred that eliminated every member of the Andren extended family. Mankell's newest police heroine, Vivi Sundberg, soon arrives on the scene. She is a formidable middle aged amazon that we instinctively trust, much the same as we instantly relax when Kurt Wallander takes charge of the situation. She makes the grisly discovery of mutilated bodies in practically every home in the town. Vivi assumes a leadership role in the investigation, in the same manner as Kurt Wallander usually does; more from a reluctance of others to do so in a void of leadership. Mankell's readers are already looking to Sundberg as a Wallander-type character but that hope is soon dashed as she demonstrates a unbelievably unimaginative aptitude for police work. This angle introduced by Mankell profiles a confusing and ultimately unresolved commentary on the Swedish judicial system but what is worse for the reader is to meet a potentially fascinating character who quickly disappoints.<br />Now we meet a female judge, Birgitta Roslin; a tedious character that Mankell fails to make interesting despite his tremendous success with similar unlikeable characters in his other novels. Nevertheless, Roslin has a pivotal role in the novel; she has a connection to the murders in Hesjovallen! Her mother had been fostered out to an Andren family there as a child. This tenuous link to her past tweaks her interest in the murders and, together with her unaware, yet barely concealed desire to evaluate her mid life status, sets her on the road to the hamlet. This story would be far more thrilling and believable if Roslin had a genuine familial relationship that advanced the plot but the tenuous thread fails to convince the reader. Nevertheless, the reader is so eager to get back to the original murder investigation that we are willing to accompany Roslin.<br />Roslin is a far better detective than Sundberg . Mankell chooses to have these two women work in exclusion of each other despite an abundance of opportunity; this diminishes the plot and further frustrates the reader. Next Mankell introduces Lars Emanuelsson, an investigative journalist, who repels Roslin with his aggression and foul personal hygiene, but who is the first potentially decisive and focused character we have met so far. The reader is engaged once again and clings to Emanuelsson in the hope that Roslin and Mankell make use of him to deepen and advance the plot. Both fail to do so.<br />Roslin discovers old Andren family documents that link the Swedish Andrens to a man who emigrated to build the railway in Nevada at the turn of the century. She is investigating an Andren family connection as the motive for the murders. She uncovers a similar murder of a family of Andrens in Nevada just months ago! Roslin briefly excels by conducting her own investigation that actually reveals the real murderer. When this evidence is presented to the police, they fail miserably in pursuing the leads she hands them. This would have been an excellent time for the abrasive and foul smelling Lars Emanuelsson to become involved in order to develop the plot but Mankell opts instead to introduce a second, even more complex and far less original story line into the novel as a means of connecting the characters. At the crossroads of making a real thriller out of this novel, Mankell again drops the reader in what is quickly becoming a familiar sense of disappointment.<br />The second third of this long novel begins with the story of 3 brothers in 18th century China and their suffering in slavery at the hands of a brutal man called \\"JA\\". This extremely drawn out story line side tracks merely to introduce the JA character and his impact on the Chinese brothers. It takes too much time to tell and is not very interesting to boot, especially when it fails to clearly connect to the present. The reader becomes more distanced from the original story line and is further frustrated.<br />We are then introduced to Ya Ru, a Chinese megalomaniac of wealth and power in present day China. He is a political `facilitator\\" and behind a plot to rid China of its millions of poor while leveraging control over an African country that is a rich source of raw materials for China's manufacturing industries. We also meet his sister Hong Qui, a modern but conservative political force who opposes her brother's goals, but even she cannot imagine how vast they are. Ya Ru's story includes his intermittent readings from the journal of his ancestor, the only surviving brother who so suffered at the hands of the railroad boss \\"JA\\". We begin to suspect the possible connection to the Sweden and Nevada murders, however, because of the century plus interval and the current political intrigue in China, this theme is all but obscured for the reader. Mankell tries to connect the Roslin/Andren family to this powerful Chinese family in the present as well, but his efforts are transparent and not convincing. It does build suspense but at the cost of the better story which is the Swedish murder mystery. The China story is well worth its own novel and both stories would have been better told if done separately.<br />This novel began with terrific promise and a great investigative story. The reader was dropped too many times however and soon begins to feel taken advantage of. The characters with promise were born and died in a breath while the indulgent characters went on forever. There were too many unnecessary characters and in the end, Roslin was simply lucky, not smart, to have survived. For diehard fans of Mankell, this book was endured with renewable anticipation and loyalty but was a frustrating and disappointing read.ry line side tracks merely to introduce the JA character and his impact on the Chinese brothers.

1400052173|5.0|Rebecca Skloot tells the fascinating, tragic story of Henrietta Lacks, who contributed to some of science's biggest advancements in the 20th century, including the polio vaccine and cancer and AIDS research. Her stored cancer cells, known as HeLa cells, are used daily around the world in various fields of medical research. Henrietta herself never knew that her cells were collected and distributed; despite the millions of dollars generated by HeLa sales (depending on the variety, some labs charge as much as $10,000 per vial), her surviving children and grandchildren never received a penny or a formal apology from Johns Hopkins.<br /><br />Lacks was descended from slaves and sharecroppers, and lived her short life working in Virginia's tobacco fields and raising her five children. She started having children with her first cousin David as a teenager, and her youngest daughter Elsie was born retarded and epileptic, quite possibly from syphilis passed on to Henrietta by her husband. Elsie was institutionalized and died at fifteen. A year before Henrietta finally went to the colored ward at Johns Hopkins, she felt a lump in her cervix. She shared her fears with her girl cousins, but never went to the doctor. Soon after, she became pregnant with Joe, her fifth child. The lump was put aside until months after Joe's birth, when more pressing symptoms presented themselves. Howard Jones, the gyncecologist on duty, had never seen a tumor quite like Henrietta's: it was shiny and purple \\"like Grape Jello\\" and bled at the slightest touch.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to Henrietta, Jones and his boss, Richard Wesley TeLinde, were involved in a national debate on cervical cancer. TeLinde used patients from the public wards for research, including Henrietta. Before inserting radium to treat her tumor, Jones removed two dime-sized pieces of cervical tissue: one healthy, one cancerous. He took the samples to George Gey's lab, where scientists had been trying and failing to grow cell samples. But Henrietta's cancer cells didn't die; they multiplied at an astonishing rate, doubling every 24 hours.<br /><br />When Henrietta came back for radiation treatment, it initially appeared that her cancer was cured; doctors found no new masses, despite Henrietta's complaints of pain. Doctors dismissed her claims on several other occasions, until she ended up in the hospital with a large inoperable tumor that blocked her urethra. Henrietta declined rapidly, and her abdomen was scorched black from the radiation treatments. This didn't stop the spread of the tumors, which seemed to appear daily on nearly every surface. Henrietta was in excruciating pain during her two-month hospitalization; it was so acute that she was strapped to her bed to keep her from thrashing onto the floor. She died at age 31 on October 4, 1951 from acute uremia; because doctors were not able to pass a catheter into her bladder, the toxins in her urine built up in her bloodstream. During the autopsy, her body was so riddled with tumors that it appeared that she had ropes of pearls inside her abdominal cavity.<br /><br />Her four children were shuttled between relatives, where they were subjected to verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Two of them would later be involved in murder and substance abuse; all suffered from health problems and didn't have adequate insurance. When Rebecca Skloot tried to meet with them in order to conduct research, she was faced with fierce initial resistance. The surviving Lackses were deeply angry, frightened and confused about the theft of their mother's cells and the enormous profits that they generated for biotech companies (however, the initial samples taken by Jones and cultivated by Gey were given away to other researchers without profit); they'd also been hit by a con man claiming to help them research their mother's hospitalization and treatment at Hopkins. But Rebecca is finally admitted into their inner circle, and tells their story largely in their own words recreated from numerous interviews and visits. She takes the time to truly help them understand the impact of their mother's legacy (they had limited formal education), and to set up a Henrietta Lacks Foundation to be used as scholarship money for Henrietta's grandchildren.<br /><br />The chapters shuttle between Henrietta's final months in 1951 and the development of the HeLa line throughout the 1950s to today, as well as Rebecca's meetings with the family in 1999-2001.  Each chapter heading has a timeline graphic clearly showing the timeframe, which helps to follow along. Henrietta's enormous contribution is discussed in detail, as is the emerging field of bioethics and cloning. Several tabloid-style articles referring to HeLa merged with plant and animal cells conjure nightmarish sci-fi images of giant mice men and human plants (there are references to Jurassic Park). I was deeply interested in biology and anatomy / physiology in high school, so I had no problem following the scientific aspects of the story.<br /><br />There are numerous vintage photographs of Henrietta and her young family, the town of Clover, VA, and more recent family photos. A fairly comprehensive notes section is also included.  I couldn't put the book down; Henrietta's story is gripping; not just for her contribution to science, but as a vibrant portrait of a loving mother whose children never get to know her, and the deep hurts that Rebecca tries to heal.terviews and visits.

0312360266|4.0|In the world of the House of  Night books, vampyres have always existed side by side with humans. They are, in fact, leaders in the arts and culture. Vampyrism is not hereditary, nor is it a blood disease; instead, teenagers are \\"marked\\" with a tattoo by a vampyre Tracker when they are near their change, and they must be brought to live with other vampyres or they'll die. Death remains a danger for these young fledglings, as they're called, as there is no way of knowing for sure if they will ultimately survive the change to full vampyre.<br /><br />Zoey Redbird is just trying to get her textbook so that she can study for the geometry test that she's dreading when the Tracker marks her in the hallway of her high school. She isn't exactly loving her life before this happens: her best friend is annoying, her boyfriend (almost-ex boyfriend, that is) drinks too much, and her mother is more interested in her new marriage to an Elder in the People of Faith than she is in parenting. The Mark means that Zoey needs to get to the House of Night, a vampyre boarding school in Tulsa where she can learn to be an adult vampyre.<br /><br />I like a lot of things about this novel. I like that it is set in Oklahoma and not New York. I like Zoey. She manages to be tough and vulnerable at the same time. As a reader, I believed that she was overwhelmed and scared on this new world, and at the same time I believed that she was strong enough to stand up to the school mean girl. I also like the elaborate world that the Casts have created. There is a lot of detail and description in this novel, all of which takes place during Zoey's first few days at the House of Night. Because Zoey is also new to this world, everything is explained and described.<br /><br />That is also my one criticism of the book: not a lot happens. I mean, a lot happens, but there's not really one plot that drives you through the story. Zoey adjusts. Zoey makes friends. Zoey finds her place in the school. While I enjoyed all of this, it was pretty clear that this novel was primarily a launchpad for a full series. When you get to the end of the book, you still have no idea who the ultimate big bad is. In fact, if I didn't know that this was part of a larger series, then I would say that this was an entertaining novel where nothing much really happens, and not much was resolved, and I wouldn't like it.<br /><br />There are, however, many more novels in the series, and so I like this one. I want to know what happens to Zoey and her friends, and I hope that later novels address what has happened to the rest of Zoey's world, like her family and her friends. I'm not racing out to by book two, but I'll definitely pick it evetually.<br /><br />Also, although younger kids will want to read this, it should definitely be 14 and up.tty clear that this novel was primarily a launchpad for a full series.

B000002MTR|5.0|Contrary to many critics who think this album are either bad or medicore I actually enjoy it from start to finish. I already own all RHCP albums except this and by the way and I must say I'm not disapointed any bit, the first 2 tracks I'd consider it as one of RHCP classics, Warped somehow sounds like an alternative-metal, aeroplane is really a great groovy tune with great bassline etc. My friend &  tearjerker are a solid slower tune on this record.<br /><br />The other tracks are great but this album is NOT as catchy as most RHCP big hits  such as californication, scar tissue, otherside, dani california, descreation smile, give it away,etc. Dave Navarro influence on this album is in fact what makes this album a unique RHCP album as he only appeared on this one record and he wrote some really cool stuff.
0451208706|5.0|This book enjoys continuing popularity twenty eight years after it first hit the bestseller list, and with good reason.  It is a masterfully crafted thriller.  In fact Albert Zuckerman (Writing the Blockbuster Novel) uses The Man from St. Petersburg as a pedagogical tool for outlining a novel.  Zuckerman shows how Follett's outlines of the plot evolved over four outlines.  The complexities of plot and the revelation of character did not flow through Follett's fingertips as he was typing.  The result is one of the very best novels written, of any genre, and one of the few which deserve its commercial success.<br /><br />Feliks, a Russian anarchist, is intent on killing the Russian Prince sent by the Tsar to negotiate an alliance with England, to prevent Germany from taking over all of Western Europe.  His motivation is to save the lives of Russian peasants who would be killed in a cause not their own.  His unwitting ally is the daughter of an English lord, who is at an age when rebellion against her parents is natural.  The action builds to a fiery crescendo as the lord's manor house burns, and young Winston Churchill gets the prince's signature on the treaty minutes before the anarchist fires a shotgun point blank into his chest.  In the process Follett gives us a rather serious lesson in history.  You will understand where all the pieces were on the chessboard that was Europe in 1914.<br /><br />Read it for the excitement; read it as history; or read it for its classic structure, but you must read it.
B00162GWFS|4.0|1 star-It sucks  2 stars-Fair  3 stars-Good  4 stars-Great  5 stars-Excellent    In 1983, a new style of Metal was forming. The music was getting faster and heavier and lyrics were getting darker, more nihilistic and glommier. This new music was Thrash Metal and it combined elements of NWOBHM and Hardcore Punk. And a good way to kick start this new scene was Slayer's Show No Mercy. While not as memorable as Kill 'Em All by Metallica, I feel this album should deserve its share of the credit. If you know Slayer by their \\"Reign In Blood\\" type stuff, you may be surprised that this album has more in common with their NWOBHM roots than their Thrash/Speed Metal stylistics. The music is pretty good. It has a lot energy and the lyrics remind you of early Venom. The production sucks, but it hey, the songs are good so it doesn't really matter. The only gripe I have about this album, that I really don't care much for the NWOBHM style. Don't get me wrong, I like the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, but I feel that Slayer is still trying to find their sound and is not sure about the direction they want to go. But it's a good album and should be reconized as one of the albums that helped kicked start the Thrash Metal scene.

B002Q9MZHE|4.0|I bought this blu-ray disc for my husband's Valentine's Day gift. We are both opera enthusiastc, but since he sings in the chorus of our regional opera company, we never get to watch them together. So, a film like this one was areal treat for us.    The production values were very good and the singing suberb. However, We were both disappointed that the chorus was never shown singing, which for us, detracted somewhat from our enjoyment-- my husband would have like dto see another chorus in action. We were also disappointed to watch the credits and learn that some of the other bohemians were lip-synching. Of course we had expected some over dubbing, but lip-synching...    Still, these were relatively minor disppoaintements and over all it is very enjoyable listen to and to watch.
B0010ZR160|4.0|This starts as a crime drama about a missing child in inner-city Boston, but quickly morphs into a more complex and rather unrealistic story. I will just mention elements already discussed by others: The plot is verrry hard to swallow, almost laughably so, with the entire cast of characters (including all the cops) turning out to be part of a highly improbable conspiracy. The high profile actors Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are professional but lack something in their performances here. Casey Affleck is unconvincing as a \\"teenage\\" private eye and his girlfriend comes across as a bland cipher. Ben Affleck's first try as a director gets uneven results - Ben, don't give up your day job. The supposed overarching moral dilemma does not appear in the first 3/4 of the movie; it is just dropped in at the end as from a helicopter. And in contrast an earlier 'moral' item - Casey's extrajudicial execution of a suspected child molester by summarily shooting him in the head without benefit of arrest, judge or jury - this does not seem to cause a ripple. To put it mildly, things just wouldn't happen that way. Bottom line: a vanity project for the Affleck brothers.<br /><br />But let me move on two elements that make this worth watching, especially if you have lived in Boston.<br /><br />First, the depiction of white working-class inner-city Dorchester (Boston) is really very good, including the photography of the neighborhood, the Quincy quarries, and the colorful lowlife townies, especially in the scarey first bar scene. I lived there and I've seen those guys! And the cinematography is excellent; every shot well framed.<br /><br />Second, there is one standout performance plus a memorable cameo. Amy Ryan plays the hard-edged, slutty, coke-addicted mother of the missing child - the sort of mother who leaves her 4 year old alone while she gets high in a bar. She is just phenomenal in this difficult-to-capture, unsympathetic role, right down to her too-tight jeans and streetwise humor. She gets it just right; all the nuances are flawless. Her early scene of foul-mouthed verbal abuse of her extended family, her sarcastic admissions of criminality, all perfect, the equal of any high-art Tennessee Williams play. She received not only an Academy Award nomination but several other awards for Best Supporting Actress, all fully deserved. She is assisted in this through a cameo role by one Jill Quigg, a non-professional from the neighborhood who was drafted off the street for her ability to crack out expletives in the local dialect. She has not just the accent but the authentic persona of a tough Boston Irish girl from the projects. I ran back the movie a second time just to watch Quigg, her tone of voice and mannerisms; perfect.<br /><br />By itself the movie would get two stars because it is poorly structured. But if you have lived in Boston it will be so much more interesting to watch, so make it three. Amy Ryan shows what it means to be a high end actress and easily adds a fourth. Nothing will make it five however.ight; all the nuances are flawless.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|Just like when they had Sigourney Weaver narrate Planet Earth, they decided that U.S. audiences aren't sophisticated enough to listen to the very well spoken David Attenborough.<br /><br />I was surprised with the Discovery Blu-Ray of Planet Earth as a gift, and was unable to return it to get the BBC version. I certainly don't watch it as much as I would if I had the BBC version.<br /><br />Hopefully, few people will waste their money on this turkey.  Get the BBC version, and if they sub with this one, send it back without opening the package.
0670021652|4.0|I am on vacation in Penscola, Fl and I have just finish reading this book.  Like the book before this one, it immediately captured my interest and I found it hard to put down.  Ms. Gilbert does a wonderful job of telling her story and allowing me the opportunity to resolve some of my own skepticism on this subject.  I too have been married once where the relationship ended after only 18 mos. or so.  Now I am in a new relationship but I can't seem to bring myself to marry again.  Most everything she discusses in the book is very close to my heart.  While I have not made peace completely in marrying again, I believe I am a tad bit closer and I have started to piece back where marriage might actually be beneficial for me.  Thanks for doing the research and sharing your most intimate experiences.  I am forever grateful.  Very well then and I wish you all the happiness being \\"one\\" can bring.

B0006B2A42|2.0|I enjoyed and admired Alistair MacLean's book _Ice Station Zebra_ (which I have reviewed at my site AlistairMacLean.com, along with all his other novels). Wish I could say the same for the movie.    One quibble is with the acting. Rock Hudson acquitted himself well as the submarine commander, but Patrick McGoohan alternated strangely between mystery and buffoonery; Ernest Borgnine was a bad parody of a Russian; and Jim Brown looked like a football player trying to act.    The weird musical interruptions at the start and at \\"Intermission\\" time were a jarring note. So were the bad special effects trying to show Soviet jet fighters zooming around.    Worst of all, though, was the desecration of Alistair MacLean's original plot. That one had long sequences of mysterious action, intelligence operations, and the good and bad guys trying to stay a step ahead of each other. The movie plot introduces two new goofy major characters (played by Borgnine & Brown), as well as an unrealistic confrontation between US/British and Soviet forces.    Some other film versions of MacLean thrillers, such as _The Guns of Navarone_ and _Where Eagles Dare_, are well worth watching. The film version of _Ice Station Zebra_ left me, in a word, cold.

B002VPE1B6|2.0|Unless you own an IMAX screen I can't fathom why anyone would bother with this soon to be obsolete non-special edition of a film that will age horribly..    No 3D, no features, no 300\\" Screen?  Pass... a better edition will come out but at that point you won't care.    With bad characters, horrible dialogue and an unoriginal story this film is 100% reliant on visuals.  Expect in a few years for it to look dated and be considered the turd in pretty 3D it is.
B000O174CM|1.0|What a shallow, jivey take on the heyday of black pop crossover.  We've seen it all before, done with just as much disregard for pop history and music similarly mediocre.  I'm thankful that Jennifer Hudson fever has passed. Correction, she sings horribly in a new series of Weight Watchers ads in which it seems each syllable has been edited and even that can't fix the shrill, constipated performance.  She's a run-of-the-mill, overheated, overrated faxed-in diva.      Unacceptibly poorly lip-synched, the forgettable, mediocre music is fake early 70's soul cheese/Broadway maudlin, yet the plot - show bizness back-stabbing, Cadillacs, cliched cash-accumulation montages, sundry pimpy stuff and of course, Negroes dopin' it up - seems set, judging by all the cultural references, vintage cars, riots, MLK, at the rise of the Supremes in the 60's.  I do like Eddie Murphy's slippery, egotistical character but his instant transformation into James Brown was absurd.      Will Hollywood ever stop making movies like this?  Apparently not as long as people have short-memories and are swayed by relentless media-hype.  This is dreck. Have you forgotten about it yet? This is \\"soul\\" jive for white people, Simon Cowell and Hollywood tinkling on us all for cash.  It has nothing to do with the Supremes, or anything real for that matter. I wanted to like it, having heard so many raves from the professional critics, but I should have known better.  When one-word reviews like \\"magnificent\\" and \\"stunning\\" are all you hear, you're hearing the voices of shills whose highest aspirations are to get their banalities on TV so maybe they can get famous too.
B00003CXPD|4.0|Billy is a wonderfully happy and energetic boy with a great talent.  This movie is uplifting but realistic and I suggest for audiences over 14. I thought it might be something I'd like my 8 year old grandson to see but too much profanity and the 'F' word.
0312370849|5.0|Two voices, one wonderful book!  Chapters are short and beautifully written.  The voice switches for much of the book between (third person) a Jewish child in France during the war and (1st person) a journalist studying the period of the \\"roundup\\".  Both the child and journalist bring mysteries to the story and, each is very intriguing and dramatic.  Can't say anything more except:  highly recommended.
B00005JLR2|4.0|Is this the best kids movie/Disney movie ever?  Not quite - but, it is certainly worth watching.  With the onslaught of girly, princess shows/films, it is sometimes difficult to find a fun, age appropriate show/movie for little boys.  My son is four - we just watched it for the first time, and he loved it.  Most super hero movies interest him, but are way too violent - hence, he doesn't get to see them.  There is a lot of action in Treasure Planet, enough to spark the imagination of my four year old - but not so scary/violent that it scares him.<br />I don't look at this as a replacement of Treasure Island, it is just a fun, pirate-space movie.  Realistic?  maybe not to the critics, but it is wonderfully real to my kid.  (the opening sky surfing scene had him shouting \\"That is SO cool!\\" at the TV. )  This will have a  spot on our shelf next to Meet The Robinsons, another fun \\"boy\\" movie.

B00138KBQ6|3.0|I have compared the 2002 remastered versions with the orignals... the difference might be missed by some but... i assure you the 1995 remaster is better if you take the time to listen closely....it's better because the 2002 is remixed and partly remade (easiest to hear the difference for yourself by comparing Goodbye to romance orignal stuidio version to its partly remade version both are easy to find on youtube) . This is falsely labeled remaster it is a remake. Do yourself a favor and DONT buy the 2002 remade version. Plain and simple if u have ears and are payin attention it just dont sound as good. Besides i think any real fan would want the orignal versions no matter what.<br />PS theres a new remaster of this out thats 2nd best with bonus tracks(due to some small defects and loudness of the mix) to the 95 remaster.

B00011V8AE|5.0|An album like this can easily be lost in a catalog of the greatest American musician of our times, with enough songs that could fill several albums worth of greatest hits collections, its no wonder that the baby faced self-titled \\"Folk\\" debut is frequently skipped over. Sure, Folk music as a genre hasn't held up as well as Dylan himself, heck the man went electric and never looked back. That being said,  this isn't Folk, this is Dylan...  the man rips, I mean rips the hell out of songs like \\"In My Time of Dyin\\", \\"Fixin to Die\\", \\"Highway 51\\", \\"House of the Risin Sun\\" and the goose bump raisin \\"See That My Grave is Kept Clean\\".   Keep in mind this is Dylans voice, his acoustic guitar and the occasional harmonic; nothing else. The bareness of the production only increases the intensity of this whole recording.   This is mind blowing stuff, a testament that Robert Zimmerman was a phenomenon from the moment he allowed us to listen.     This is my first Sundazed record, all my other Dylan records are original Columbia mono pressings, that being said I'm extremely happy with the sound and the remastering that they created with their new pressings. I look forward to buying many more new pressings from Sundazed and hope that all their records are this great.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I'd like to begin in saying that if you're looking for a film that can be described as the modern-day classic Disney, then this is the movie for you!  Naturally there will probably never be another 'classic' quite like Snow White or Cinderella, but The Princess and the Frog does a fine job of living up to the classic Disney name.    I first seen the film in theatres, and though a bit skeptical in how much I'd be into an animated, 2-D musical formatted like the oldies of yester-year, I found myself thoroughly enthralled by the perfection of the animation, the plotline, and the over-all quality of the film; considering the film was brought to us by the directors of such films as \\"Aladdin\\" and \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" we can only expect as much!  I'm in my early 20's, and I was just as giddy about the film as the little girl sitting next to me in the theatre was.  It's filled with wonderful music, spectacular scenery, and a very nice streak of comedy that will keep you asking for more!    Over-all \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" has, to me, turned out to be a true masterpiece which I am sure will be treasured in the years to come.  (Especially since it's the last 2-D film that, may possibly, ever be created by Disney.)
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Saw it in 3-D theater. One of the best movies ever made in my opinion, and bought a Blue-Ray player in anticipation of it's release. Granted, there will be a Special edition later as some people mention, but the way marketing is I'm betting not until near the holidays. Great idea for your Christmas list though ;)
B000AJIAOO|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this album.  I'm a bit apprehensive about buying new artists in the symphonic/gothic/metal category.  My experience is that as the genre grows in popularity, the range in spectrum from the band that make a lot of noise with lyrics that only gods and goddesses would relate to, to the ones that have memorable music and great lyrics continues to grow.<br /><br />I'm glad to say The Silent Force falls into the latter end of the spectrum.  Most of the songs on this album are very strong.  The Intro, \\"Angels\\", \\"Destroyed\\", \\"Jane Doe\\", \\"Jilian\\", \\"Aquarius\\", \\"It's the Fear\\" and \\"Memories\\" are my top picks.  \\"Stand My Ground\\" has great lyrics but not as powerful musically as the songs I just listed.  \\"Somewhere\\" is beautiful but sounds a bit overproduced and I have to be in the right mood for it.  The rest of the album is tight and solid, but not memorable which is why I only give it four stars.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a good symphonic metal album with a wonderful female vocal lead sans death grunts of any kind and meaningful (for mere mortals) lyrics, this is a good choice!

0375842209|5.0|This is not typically anything I would pick up to read.  A story about a German family hiding a Jewish man during WWII?  Uh no thanks, too heavy for me.  But it has gotten so many rave reviews that I had to pick it up, and then of course, I could not put it down.  A couple of things really intrigued me:  First of all, the narrator is Death.  Hmmm.  And guess what?  Death has a really funny sense of humor!  Secondly, the use of language is so unique that I thought for sure the book had to be translated from a different language, but it was not.  It was originally published in Australia (and I *think* they speak English there, haha!)  Another unique aspect to the book is the little interruptions, which add greatly to the whimsy - if whimsy is a word you can use about a story narrated by Death on the subject of Jewish persecution in Nazi Germany.  Actually, this is quite a compelling book, and surprisingly not heavy, and not desperate and depressing, even with such a dark subject.  It's technically classified as YA but I would suggest it for more mature teens, as it might not be quite interesting enough for the group that is currently reading Twilight and Hunger Games.  And adults, of course.  It's great for adults.
B0029LHW68|4.0|If u liked A Beautiful Lie b sure to pick this up. 30 seconds definatley delivered in this follow up. Kings and Queens was a great way to attract people to this album it's probably my favorite off this cd. The chourus is sung by fans of the band, how great is that. There r plenty of great lyrics w/ their signature dramatic backdrop. The cover art was such a great idea there r plenty of faces and then the tiger is underneath. You can throw this in and listen to a couple songs but its also good to put on and let it play through.
1400032717|5.0|This was a great book for me for two reasons - first, it's written from an interesting POV, that of a 15-year-old autistic boy.  Second, it's a mystery, a murder mystery to be exact, the mystery of who killed the neighbor's dog by stabbing it with a garden fork.  The POV was the more compelling reason, and I was totally intrigued by the thought processes displayed.  While autistic children are generally portrayed as self-enclosed, it is the furthest thing from the truth - in actuality, they are too exposed to sensation; their brains seem to lack the filters that ordinary people unconsciously use to make sense of the world.  Christopher is a complex mathematical genius, but he can't understand the complexity of human emotions.  Every statement is taken literally, so he can't make sense of slang and idioms.  He loves red and hates yellow and brown with a passion.  He can't stand to be touched, even to be hugged by his parents, and resorts to screaming tantrums or \\"groaning\\" to himself when he is disturbed or overwhelmed by his surroundings.  The toll this takes on his family is enormous, as they try to deal with his idiosyncrasies through varying levels of patience and frustration.  It's a quick little book to read, but powerful in its story.  The characters are sympathetic in spite of their failings, and Haddon doesn't descend into trite sentimentality.  I felt enlightened and inspired when I was finished.
0553057006|5.0|This is a very well-written and helpful book that should be read by everyone who is a parent or who had toxic parents to avoid repeating the same mistakes with their own children. If the mistakes have already been made, there are tips on how to correct them...
0061537969|5.0|I want a dog like Enzo!  This wonderful bittersweet little book is told from the point of view of Enzo the dog, who lives with Denny Swift, an aspiring race-car driver.  Enzo is kind, loyal, and very smart. Very aware of what is going on in his world.  And he makes a convincing argument for why dogs would be just as good as humans if they only had thumbs.  Enzo has done a lot of learning from watching things like Discovery Channel all day on TV, and he absorbs all of the racing lessons that Denny imparts to him.  And he believes with all his heart that when he dies, he will be reincarnated as a man.  So Enzo lives with Denny through his romance and marriage to Eve, through the birth and early years of their daughter Zoe's life, and everything is wonderful.  Then Eve gets sick, and their life quickly becomes very bad.  Enzo chronicles it all with an amazing perception that most people don't have.  This book will make you laugh and will probably make you cry, but it is a happy kind of sad, and a sad kind of happy.  And truly a wonderful book.
0609610570|1.0|I tried to read this book. I value books that speak to the importance of operational excellence (re \\"Out of the Crisis\\" by Deming) but this book is vague, verbose, and simplistic. I found myself getting frustrated in chapter 1 and by chapter 3 I could not read another word.
0061474355|5.0|I heard a lot about Garth Nix before I finally decided to look up his books, and I am so glad I finally did.  Sabriel is the first book in the Abhorsen trilogy, set in a world where the Dead can come back to life (and they are never good, only hideous and evil)  and only a wall separates the safety of Ancelstierre from the dangers of the Old Kingdom.  Charter (aka Good) magic fights the endless war against the evils of Free Magic and the necromancers who call the Dead back to life.  The Abhorsen is a magician who uses Charter Magic to bind and force the Dead back across the thin line between Life and Death.  Death is a place, and Nix's vivid descriptions of gates and landscape render its geography as real as any in our world.  Sabriel has grown up on the safe side of the wall, not knowing that her father is the Abhorsen, and she reluctantly discovers that she must take his place when he disappears.  Definitely not your ordinary dragons and fairies fantasy story, this is a lot darker and grimmer.  But awesome!  And there are many more books from Nix; I suspect he will soon have a permanent revolving spot on my shelf.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I finally got around to seeing this film after so much talk about how awesome it is, and so many spoofs and parodies done about it. Totally Awesome! After studying film, I enjoy that this movie, although very CGI (but you couldn't pull off even 1/20 the visuals without it), this movie takes you into the mystical and inspiring world of ancient Greece, and tells of the legendary 300 spartans.    If you enjoy action movies, or other movies based around epic historical accounts, do not hesitate like i did, buy it, rent it, whatever, just watch it! You will not regret seeing this EPIC film!    And for those who give it a low score, come on, enjoy it for what it is, a truly epic film (which if you've seen most movies recently, besides say Avatar, you will not find anything close to this in recent cinema history.)    Spartans, what is your profession?  HAWOO! HAWOO!!
0545123267|5.0|When Grace was a little girl, she was attacked by a pack of starving wolves that lived in the woods behind her house.  Somehow she was rescued, but who rescued her has never been clear, and she retains strange memories of one of the wolves stopping the others from killing her.  Years later, she still watches the wolves, especially the one she has identified as HER wolf.  The town, however, is not feeling as kindly toward the wolves, especially after a local boy is mauled to death.  When a hunting party is organized, Grace tries to stop it, then finds a boy on her porch who has been shot.  It is Sam, and he is HER wolf.  Human in warm weather and a wolf when it turns cold, Sam is in love with Grace, and she with him.  He fears that when this winter comes, he will turn into a wolf forever, and neither he nor Grace can stand the thought.  The love story is tender and beautiful, as the falling temperatures intensify the desperate need to find a solution to their problem.  Will they find it before Sam loses his humanity forever?  Completely satisfying ending, although it looks like there is a sequel (Linger) coming in July.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|If we're going to establish credibility where non can be found (Oprah's academic credentials anyone?) why stop with her and try to find an even more unaccomplished narrator?  No wonder kids who most need education don't want to expend the effort to attain it when a celebrity buffoon con artist can shortcut all the efforts of concentrated study and pose as a deliverer of unattained knowledge?  Just when you think corruption of mind and spirit couldn't possibly take a deeper form, it does.  So, with all due disrespect I'm holding out for the Jerry Springer version.
B0034JKZ86|3.0|I like this movie a lot.  It is cute and funny and I love the new characters.  I like the history of the New Orleans area that is included.<br /><br />I am not Cajun or African American, but if I were I would be offended at the way they are portrayed in this movie.  The Cajuns are made out to be stupid idiots roaming the wild.  I thought the African Americans would be the successful ones the story was about and was sorely dissapointed to find out that they were the average Joe's and the white people were the successful, rich people.  I really had hoped that Tiana would be the princess that was successful.<br /><br />It is somewhat dark though.  I appreciate the VooDoo that was included since that is true to the story of New Orleans, but for a kid, it is a little scary.
B002Y0MQ6A|3.0|Hardly the worst 90 minutes I ever spent, but it was such an attempt at a 28 Days Later imitation for the weak stomached I can't give it rave review. It was able to hold my attention, but just missed that wow factor that 28 Days had for me. Perhaps it just set the bar too high. This was a nice try, but no cookie.     The acting was decent, I'll say that. It at least had a few recognizable faces and they gave a good performance. The script was ok, and the plot was a bit sluggish. The production values were nothing to complain about nor the special effects. The story line as a whole just missed the mark and needed more substance, less predictability. It undoubtedly referenced several other movies, leaving hard core genre fans with nothing new to experience. Those that haven't seen as many zombie/Apocalypse virus movies, might find it more interesting. While definitely watchable, it left me unfulfilled.      All in all, I'd say it's 28 Days Later, the \\"diet\\" version. It may taste great, but seriously less filling.
0545123267|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down!  The use of imagery that Maggie Stiefvater uses is remarkable.  The story immediately draws you in and you become addicted, unable to put it down.  The characters are well developed and the storyline draws you in.  I love how the book is written from the two perspective's, Sam's and Grace's.  A must read!  Can't wait till the second book comes out as well.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Though it was a long time coming, in the case of \\"Up\\" it's almost a shame that the Academy created a separate category for feature length animated films.  In a word, it was one of the best films of 2009, period.  Aside from terrific visuals and a great story this film makes cogent observations about aging and loneliness as well as the value of friendship.  My parents, in their seventies now, loaned this movie to me.  They bought it after taking the grandkids to see it.  I conclude this review by saying, \\"Thanks, Mom and Dad!\\".
B001G0MFOM|5.0|Many people have given poor ratings for the 6th season, and for The L Word in general.  I must refer to one of my earlier reviews about The L Word series.  Any internationally shown TV series involving lesbians is a fantastic feat. If you are over 40, then you will know what I'm talking about.  The more coverage the LGBTQO communities get the better all around.  Lighten up folks, and go with the flow.  Time moves very slowly ('80's) at times.  At other times, it moves VERY QUICKLY ('70's).  Think of it in this simplistic way: 3 steps forward, 1 step backward!!!THE L WORD,
B002SJIO4A|3.0|This flick was definitely overhyped.  I was taken in by the rave reviews it got plus the Oscar nomination for Best Picture(!).  This is not the groundbreaking film you would be led to believe.  The docu-style filmmaking isn't exactly groundbreaking and it's been done before and better.  You might raise an eyebrow when you consider that it was done on a lower budget, $30 million, than your average Hollywood flick but that passes.  The Johannesburg locations are certainly exotic.  The analogy to apartheid is trite and obvious.  This flick certainly isn't in the same league as \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" or the first two \\"Alien\\" movies.  The best you can say about \\"District 9\\" is it moves pretty good and keeps your attention throughout.  Just don't confuse it as something significant because it certainly is not that.

I couldn't load the copy, so I expect most people never us the copy.  Otherwise there would be more compaints.  There is not convenient Disney number to call when it does not work.   Good luck.
B000053VBL|5.0|I LOVED this film.  My heart jumped so many times I was shocked.  The last 2 minutes are astounding.  I had no idea how much Quentin Tarantino was influenced by foreign films as well as the usual roadhouse B-movie flicks he rants about.  This is brazen, sexy, obsessed, intense vicious cold-blooded killing; period.  And it's done by a petite little woman who knows exactly what she wants and how to manipulate men into ASKING FOR IT.  Oh Boy, do they get it!!!!!!<br />I just can't believe modern film makers (women especially) don't refer to this film more when talking about Kick-Ass Deadly Women.
1423119509|5.0|This is such a great buy!! I recentlt saw the first percy jackson film and eventhough it was a little 'kiddie' I still really enjoyed it and thought I'd give the book a try. I was so glad I did because they are soooo much better than the film! And so much more exciting.<br /><br />Would recommend these books to anyone who enjoyed Harry Potter or likes a little adventure!
B0039UTDFG|2.0|BBC's \\"Life\\" series brings us breathtaking images of wildlife from around the world. As they did with Planet Earth, Discovery Channel has decided to replace the iconic and immensely believable David Attenborough with a \\"celebrity\\" narrator.  I made the mistake of buying the Discovery Channel version of Planet Earth, then had to re-purchase the series in order to get Attenborough's narration, which was different not only in delivery, but in script.  I ordered the new Life series as soon as it was available for pre-order, but only after checking carefully that it was the Attenborough version.  Now I see that Amazon is offering Life in both BBC and Discovery versions.  Take your choice.  Be aware that the Discovery version is different not only in narrator and script, but in length as well, being about one-and-a-half hours shorter than the BBC version. For five stars, get the BBC edition which features the irreplaceable David Attenborough.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I was so so disappointed why the movie company didn't put this in the movie theatres like they said they were on December 9.   R   For some reasons, they brought it direct to DVD, which in my view was very very disrespectful to Hachiko and the Japanese people.  If they were going to do that, they should have not made it in the first place with the top actors and directors and people who contributed to the film.  I was very disappointed with that decidsion.    If anyone knows why, does anyone know why they didn't show it in the movie theatres and decided to put it out direct to DVD?  I can't get an answer anywhere on the internet.  The film company just decided to do this without any explanations.  Someone must know.    If anyone know, please let us know.  From the reviews I've read, it seems they enjoyed this movie.  So why not put it in the theatres?????    Thanks.    Peace and love to Hachiko and the people who help to make this movie  Peace and respect
B002U33GUQ|5.0|Firstly, enough of the Keith Jarrett comparisons.  They are two very different musicians...get over it.    Ok, I've only been listening to this album for a couple days now but WOW!!!  I first became a fan of Mehldau through Largo (the first collaboration with Jon Brion) so I already loved the mix of Brion's out of the box production style, with Mehldau's melancholy and often fierce playing along with the heavy groove of Matt Chamberlain.  I think Brion and Mehldau are kindred spirits in their approaches to music (anyone who doubts it can go see Brion's own virtuosity at Largo in Los Angeles every month.)  That said, this is a VERY different record than Largo.  Largo were a bunch of songs clearly built around Brad's playing with some cool trix thrown in (strings, mellotron etc) to give the overall experience a fresh twist.  Highway Rider is more like one long story.  The strings don't just compliment the piano, in many instances, the orchestra, sax, bass etc., actually drive the songs.  At times you forget that you're listening to an album written by a virtuoso pianist because Brad hangs back and lets the arrangement speak for itself.  And Joshua Redman is the perfect pick for the predominant soloist.  Just listen to the way his solo weaves among the tangled string parts on \\"Don't Be Sad\\"...amazing.  \\"Highway Rider\\" goes from a very chaotic melody that is kinda hard to put your finger on and then resolves towards the end of the song into a beautifully hummable outro.  Jeff Ballard and Larry show why they might be the best jazz rythym section on the planet.  For me the real highlight of the album is the 20 minutes that is the truly epic score of: \\"Now You Must Climb Alone/Walking the Peak.\\"  This might be the most elaborate and beautiful piece that Brad has ever written.  It is like a Sergio Leone soundtrack in it's many peaks and valleys yet never straying far from the initial theme.  Positively breath-taking.  Aside from Ben Allison, I can't think of too many jazz musicians who are pushing so many conventional boundaries in their music with such wonderful results.  Like Allison, Brad makes albums for album-lovers.  This is a straight-up, fire-up the bong, put on some headphones and take off to another world kinda record.  Thank you Brad and the rest for this stunning album.  I haven't dug into the second half of the album yet but I will update my review once I have more to say about that portion of this masterpiece.    Bravo Brad!
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam came out of left field and knocked the music industry on its rear with their debut release \\"Ten\\". On its release date of August 27, 1991, it was not yet successful. It wasn't until they released the single `Jeremy' with its memorable and controversial music video that Pearl Jam's popularity exploded.    \\"Ten\\" is a perfect 10! Lyrically dark and depressing, but musically uplifting and powerful! Mike McCready and Stone Gossard make the album soar with their amazing guitars. Jeff Ament beautifully accents and carries the melodies with his top-notch bass. Dave Krusen assaults each song with his hammering drums. Eddie Vedder scolds life and faces demons with his amazing voice and thought-provoking lyrics.    \\"Ten\\" fades in with a meditative tune led by samba percussion and Jeff Ament's bass. This gives way to a screeching guitar bringing in the first track, `Once'. A great hard-hitting rock song and a great opener.  `Even Flow' is a straight-forward rock anthem, led by a now-classic guitar riff. Labeled as the greatest anthem of \\"Generation X\\", `Alive' is a definite classic. It's a powerful, mid-paced song with a climactic finish due to McCready's amazing guitar solo(only one of his many great solos on the album). `Why Go' begins with a quick drum and bass intro that is joined by crunching guitar. A pretty guitar riff that sounds like it's being broadcasted over the airwaves starts off another classic, `Black'. There's great blues guitar throughout, and then the song is carried out by a wailing guitar. `Jeremy' opens with a haunting bass line, and has the most catching and beautiful melody on the album. Very powerful. While it is an awesome song, `Jeremy' is most known for its video, which is what broke Pearl Jam into mainstream success. Not wanting their songs interpreted and remembered as videos, Pearl Jam stopped making music videos after `Jeremy'(their next music video wouldn't be until 1998 for `Do The Evolution', which is fully animated) . Another contender for best melody is `Oceans'. Great bass line during the verses, great rhythm guitar during bridges, and pounding drums during the instrumental breakdowns. `Porch' is a standout, adrenaline-feuled tune that is angry and genuinely structured with a great climax. `Garden' slows things down with a great rock song that builds from brooding folk to arena rock with good bass during the verses and amazing walls of guitar during the chorus. About halfway through is a great instrumental breakdown with a cool, understated guitar solo. `Deep' is the most frantic and venomous song on \\"Ten\\", it is beautiful chaos!  The album closes with the slow-paced `Release', a beautiful afterthought that builds with power into a great 3-note guitar riff. Once the song fades out, that familiar meditative tune makes its way back into your ears to bookend an excellent album.    \\"Ten\\" is a sure classic, and one of the great triumphs of Grunge and Rock N Roll!    5 HUGE STARS!    PJ Fun Facts: Rumor has it that the name \\"Pearl Jam\\" originates from Eddie Vedder's claim that he had a grandmother named Pearl married to a native American who used to make hallucinogenic jam. The band's original name was Mookie Blaylock(a basketball player), and they titled their album \\"Ten\\" in tribute to his jersey number.
1846553482|4.0|Jo Nesbø:  THE SNOWMAN<br /><br />This is Nesbø's seventh Harry Hole novel, but the fifth to be published in English.  While this is a serial killer novel, which I normally don't care for, I did enjoy this book.  Nesbø is a fluid, lyrical writer, Don Bartlett a talented translator, and Harry Hole a compelling character.<br /><br />It's the first snowfall of the season and a snowman appears outside young Jonas's house.  Strangely, the snowman is facing the house, rather than the street.  In the middle of the night, Jonas awakes and finds his mother is missing, but her scarf is now around the snowman's neck.<br /><br />As Harry's team works this missing-persons case, Harry fears that they are actually dealing with a serial killer who has left a note for Harry, taunting him.  His fear heightens as other crimes are discovered that seem to him to be related.<br /><br />As in previous books in this series, there are certain themes that connect the crimes being investigated and Harry's life.  The complexity of the various plots means that the book begins slowly and deliberately to get the stories in motion.  Then, about halfway through, things take off and become breathtakingly tense and exciting.<br /><br />Several times you may think you have the whodunnit figured out, but there are more twists and turns to come.  You learn new clues along with Harry, so there is no feel of trickery in the plot's movement.  This is typical of a Harry Hole mystery, though in this case, probably because of the nature of the crime, the red-herring suspects were less believable than usual.<br /><br />Harry's relationships with his team, his superiors and his former lover Rakel and her son Oleg continue to be an important part of the books.  And as always, Oslo itself is almost another character.<br /><br />Harry's self-loathing and titanic struggles with drink continue in THE SNOWMAN.  His addiction to his job helps combat his addiction to alcohol, but in moments of despair he falls into the pit again.  Another character tells Harry that all of the best stories are about losers.  Readers of the Harry Hole series should agree.<br /><br />Ideally, the Harry Hole series should be read in order, though that is not absolutely critical with THE SNOWMAN or its predecessor, THE REDEEMER.  It would be unfortunate, however, to read THE REDBREAST, NEMESIS and THE DEVIL'S STAR out of that order, because they function as a trilogy in one important thread of the story.f the best stories are about losers.

B002ONC9NC|4.0|You are probably reading this review after having read other reviews many of which - in my opinion - give away too much of the plot .  Like Jenny (the lead character in the film, played by first time actress Carey Mulligan), this is a film of discovery, and the less you know going in the better. Yes, it's a coming of age story, set in London in 1961. This is a period well known by Nick Hornby, who wrote the script (and is responsible for a similar sixties period film: \\"High Fidelity\\"). Hornby based his script on an autobiography by Lynn Barber and the film is directed by a woman : Lone Scherfig. So this gives it a nice balance in the sexual politics department. Jenny is a high school student - in her senior year - and meats an older man - who might - or might not  -be the one for her. That's all you need to know to enjoy this film. The Oscar nominations will tell you immediately that it is high quality.<br /><br />The DVD special features include which is now considered the standard \\"Making of\\" featurette (eight minutes) in which the actors on the set tell why they joined the project. Another eight-minute featurette \\"On The Red Carpet\\" consists of more recent interviews at the Hollywood premiere of the film (after making the \\"film festival\\" circuit). Nothing revealing there. There are 12 deleted scenes (16 minutes total), most of which are too brief to matter. The most interesting deleted scene here for Hornby fans is a brief scene in a record store. There is also an alternate ending that, when you see it, I think you'll agree it wouldn't have worked.<br /><br />There is a minor plot device about one of the characters being Jewish. This seems out of place and adds nothing to the story.<br /><br />This is the kind of film you can best appreciate at home (even on a smaller screen). It gives you time to connect with the story and the characters without disruption you might find in a theater. Enjoy it! Discover it! And you'll remember it.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

0385528752|5.0|I haven't read the Heath brothers' first book, so I didn't know what to expect. For full disclosure, let me say that I saw a promotion to get an advanced copy of the book for free, filled in my contact information, and was selected (apparently along with 10,000 other people) to get it. So, I didn't pay for the book. I've since bought the book to give to an executive at the university where my husband teaches. And he's giving it to other executives.    The book is a great read but more than that, it's inspiring. The Heaths tell stories of people who successfully changed situations and weave the stories into a series of principles that anyone can use to implement positive change. The story that stands out takes place in Vietnam; it involves solving the problem of malnutrition in children there. I won't say more, except that it will warm your heart.    Of course, the practical principles that the authors derive from the stories are what you'll be able to use to effect change in your own life or organization. If change is important to your success, I highly recommend this book. Like me, I think you'll start giving it out to others.
0393072231|5.0|I will echo many of the positive reviews here.  This is a riveting tale, told from the perspective of Wall Street \\"outsiders\\" who detected fraud, incompetence, greed, and a mix of arrogance and ill founded assumptions.  They suspected that the system was being taken over by a mass delusion, and bet against the system.  Unfortunately they were correct in their analysis.  No one in the Wall St. mainstream would listen, blinded by the biggest bubble in memory.  The real estate, subprime, credit default swaps, and \\"synthetic\\" financial instruments (full of air) crashed, and the effects are still playing out today.  As I write this another wave of mortgage defaults will soon be upon us.  The massive govt. bailouts did nothing to stem the tides of incompetence and greed.  It will, indeed is, happening again.  No one went to jail, and some of the perps are now in the Federal Govt.  So where do we put our money now?  As my broker has told me for years, \\"The system is rigged\\".      Kudos to a well told tale.  Baloney to the Kindle crybabies.  Buy an iPad...
0451169514|5.0|For me one of the best S.King novel , ever . I'm reading it for the fourth time in almost 20 years , the part when they are kids is King at his best , he knows so well how to describe naïvet&eacute; and cruelty of childhood , that Big Bill , Bev , Ben & Co are not little kids and not teenagers , too , is important . When the chapter 4 starts 'the school is , the school is ... Out !' I'm every time so excited ! William 'Bill' Denbrough with his parents grieving his little brother and that they don't even notice him anymore , Beverly and her crappy daddy , Ben and his pounds , Rich and his placebo medecines ... Just a pure marvel ! I also like very much the first part when we meet everyone , Bill married , Bev and her violent husband , Stan ... And Penny Wise the Dancing Clown ! Me who always did not liked that much clows , I can't see one now without thinking of him !<br /><br />The novel is a pure marvel , yes , except the end . The end is the big disappointing part but I still love the book . And it is a pleasure every time<br /><br />Thank you Mr.King
B0010DRYRI|5.0|This movie is superbly produced and acted. One is transported back to those days of Patrons of the Arts and fashionable Salons ruled over by the matriarchs of local society.   Mozart doesn't come out of history with too much credit and for his sake, it might have been better had this film - and history generally - had skipped over his private life and character.  His music, on the other hand, lives on and delights all music lovers to this day. Mozart was certainly a paradox of supreme proportions.
0307271862|3.0|The premise of \\"The Man from Beijing\\" is intriguing, in which almost an entire Swedish village was slaughtered and the clues led to the possible involvement of a mysterious Chinaman in the world stage. The first half of the book revolves around the mystery in Sweden, where the Swedish judge, Birgitta Roslin, found out that she is related to some of the murder victims. The ennui of her faltering marriage, ailing health and unsatisfying career is shattered by the realization that the Swedish police may be barking up the wrong tree and only she knows and believes this. She is akin to the modern day Swedish Miss Marple, and persisted in her investigations that led her halfway around the world, to Beijing.    Interspersed in the first half of the book are the experiences of three Chinese brothers who find themselves victimized and kidnapped to be forced to work on American railroads. The only indication that the Chinese story is related to the Swedish one is that the Chinese workers were supervised by a cruel man of Swedish descent.    Although the second half of the book is still fast-paced and explores the consequences of Birgitta Roslin's investigation into the Swedish murder mystery, I found it to be lackluster. The adventures and encounters she experienced seem plausible, but I couldn't help thinking to myself how out of this world they all seem to be on the pages of the book. Birgitta Roslin's character is sufficiently developed but I don't find her to be too likeable. On the other hand, many of the other characters in the story are two-dimensional and would have benefitted from more development.    There are numerous themes explored and questions posed, including those about communism, imperialism, lost foolishness of youth, etc. The story is quite thoughtful and leads readers to introspect about these questions. I found the writing style to be curt and direct, thus quickening the pace. Although the ending of the story is not open-ended, I found it to be unsatisfying and there are still questions that remain unanswered.
0060557818|4.0|A very fun, imaginative book, that is easy to read in just a few sessions. The writing is excellent, and it is easy to get swept along in the story. My complaint is that it isn't a very complex novel. It is very linear, has no subplot, and it feels as if some characters or ideas were introduced, but not ever explored by the end of the novel. A fun urban fantasy, but not much more than that.
B00004TX5F|5.0|Any fan of the Opera and Classical Music - this is a MUST see.  This movie chronicals the life of the Castrati purported to the the greatest of them all - Farinelli.  Lavish costumes, sets, direction, every thing about this movie delights the senses.  Brillian acting and the score is just wonderful.  I've heard a recoding of the last of the Castrati and in this film a male alto and female sporano are digitally combined to replicate the voice of the Castrati - not male and not female.  The practice barbaric and long discontinued, the legacy of the Castrati are preserved masterfully in this movie.  I watch it again and again.
B0011NVC98|4.0|Initially the animated style of the move turned me off. I thought why don't they just make it live action? But I really like this movie after watching it despite my initial misgivings.The story is epic, the acting terrific, and yes the animation is actually quite good.  I also had misgivings about the story itself, which suggests that Beowulf is less than honest about his dealings with Grendel's mother.But if you view the movie not as a canonical Beowulf, but as a representation of the spirit of Norse Mythology the movie has much worth.  The story is different than the poem, but the spirit of the movie is closer to the spirit of Norse Mythology than many other versions of this story put to film.The mother of Grendel is obviously the queen of all wicked witches, Gullveig as well as Angreboda the mother of monsters.Beowulf gives in to temptation, but in the end proves that he is a hero.
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|In my view, Disney's golden age of hand-drawn animation was when they pumped out memorable hits like \\"Little Mermaid\\", \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"Aladdin\\". These movies were followed by a series of lower quality relatively forgettable films like \\"Emperor's New Grove\\" and \\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\\".<br /><br />When I saw \\"Princess and the Frog\\" I felt like it ended Disney's down streak and \\"Princess and the Frog\\" might even rank it among the more venerable modern classics - sort of. The story is fresh and interesting, the characters engaging and the music is pretty catchy, even if it doesn't live up to the unobtainable legacy of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, who wrote the Oscar-winning scores of what I call the \\"golden age\\" classics.<br /><br />It's also a good change of style to the Pixar hits, as much as I love them, and makes me feel a bit nostalgic about how cartoons used to not all be rendered by computer.<br /><br />My toddlers love it, and I myself find the film entertaining! It isn't quite on the level of a \\"golden ager\\", but pretty close! Bravo, Disney!<br /><br />As far as this particular package (the \\"Three Disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy\\"), I'm a big fan of being able to take my movies with me on my iPhone for the kids to watch on car trips so I love the iTunes copy!<br /><br />Also, while I hold the controversial view that some hand-drawn Disney Blu-ray films don't really shine at 1080p (the antiquated cel animation of Snow White, for example, feels too basic to make the picture really pop), \\"Princess and the Frog\\" looks phenomenal! Cool lighting effects, shading and detailed scenery easily make this the most impressive feeling Blu-ray cartoon that doesn't use clay or silicon as the basis for its animation.<br /><br />All-in-all a great movie and an excellent package. I highly recommend it!
B0000035E7|4.0|Raw and confrontational and with a more aggressive edge than they would ever display musically again, \\"Bleach\\" was Nirvana's hungriest CD, and in my opinion, their finest. Kurt Cobain exposes the tedium and conformity of small-town life (\\"Swap Meet\\") the rigidity of the traditional masculine roles it demands (\\"Mr. Moustache\\"), demanding,one-sided relationships (\\"About a Girl\\"), Seattle's ultra-competitive, judgmental, unforgiving alternative-rock scene (\\"School\\"), significantly troubling mindsets (or behavior?) leading to (or resulting from?) drug use (\\"Negative Creep\\"), unresolved issues with autocratic authority figures (\\"Big Cheese\\") among other topics with pithy, observational lyrics, all the more refreshing because his concern was more for artistic integrity than shifting units (\\"Nevermind) or lamenting the compromises success later forced him to make (\\"In Utero\\"), lending them an unforced sense of honesty and authority that sounded hungry and alive. Cobain spits and sneers the vocals on a number of these tracks, and his razor-throated howl on \\"Negative Creep\\" and \\"Floyd the Barber\\" serves that material especially well.    And the guitar sound is much heavier than \\"Nevermind\\"s (which was located directly in the middle ranges), and more resonant than \\"In Utero's\\" (which was recorded with the intention of being abrasive, in order to re-establish street cred that only Cobain was convinced that Nirvana had lost). You can also hear the influence The Melvins had on Cobain's development as a guitarist and composer on \\"Sifting\\" and \\"Paper Cuts\\" with their deliberate pace and molassive sound.     This is what real woodshedding sounds like, and that's what got recorded on this release, the originial genius of Nirvana's sound. Though probably not for everybody, it's a crucial CD, and well worth ordering.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|In [[ASIN:B000MRAAJM Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray]]], BBC's Natural History Unit used the power of hi-defiition technology to show us the natural world as never before. In [[ASIN:B001W79MQS Nature's Most Amazing Events [Blu-ray]]], BBC raised the bar with exciting wildlife events. In [[ASIN:B002UXRGM0 Life (narrated by David Attenborough) [Blu-ray]]], BBC surpassed even its high expectations and raised the bar even higher!     I know it's cliché to say that a wildlife documentary shows you nature like you've never seen it before, but with [[ASIN:B002UXRGM0 Life]] I actually think it's true. BBC's Natural History unit seems to have gone out to find the most bizarre and wonderful animal behaviors. This isn't simply yet another Cheetah hunting another gazelle. [[ASIN:B002UXRGM0 Life]] shows you things that you (and frankly most conservation biologists) had never seen before. In fact, the series starts out with a pack of Cheetahs hunting an Ostrich! Before [[ASIN:B002UXRGM0 Life]], scientists hadn't even believed this happened.     At some points, I literally couldn't believe my eyes. I found myself rewinding every once in a while just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. For example, in the first episode, there is a scene with a Malaysian fly emerging from its pupa. That was pretty cool, but I admit I was kind of wondering whether this little insect deserved its 5-minutes of fame. What happened next shows that it did. Right in front of the camera, the little bug extended its eyestalks, blowing them up like a balloon, until they stretched ridiculously far from his body!    Each episode focuses on a different class of animals. Here is the list of episodes:    1) \\"Challenges of Life\\"  2) \\"Reptiles and Amphibians\\"  3) \\"Mammals\\"  4) \\"Fish\\"  5) \\"Birds\\"  6) \\"Insects\\"  7) \\"Hunters and Hunted\\"  8) \\"Creatures of the Deep\\"  9) \\"Plants\\"  10) \\"Primates\\"    One note: I saw the U.S. version narrated by Oprah Winfrey. I'm sure this blu-ray version of [[ASIN:B002UXRGM0 Life]] narrated by the great David Attenborough will only be even better. In fact, I can't imagine how BBC's Natural History Unit will outdo itself in its next documentary. Perhaps it'll make a 3-D wildlife documentary?

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I came here after watching about 1 1/2 episodes of Life as aired on the Discovery channel, with Oprah Winfrey narrating. That's about all I could take. Judging by the other reviews that have popped up in the last 90 minutes (tonight was the first airing on Discovery), it looks like I'm not alone.    Whenever Planet Earth was rerun on the Discovery Channel or HD Theater, I always enjoyed watching (even though I owned the blu rays). I personally thought Sigourney Weaver was decent. She was no David Attenborough, but at the same time, she didn't bug me. Not so with OW.     Simply put, Oprah is an awful narrator. There's something about her that's just, well, condescending. You'd have to watch the series on Discovery (and I don't recommend that), to see what I'm talking about. The best way to describe it is that this seems like it was narrated for a PBS documentary... aimed at kids. I mean really. The inflections in her voice sound like she's talking down to a five year old. It's so bad that after the 90 minutes I've given I refuse to watch again. I'm waiting for the BBC blu rays.     As for Life itself, it lives up to the hype and I think the camera work is just as amazing as with Planet Earth. It's definitely a buy, but just not the OW version.

B0035G1K7S|3.0|This is not a concert disc like Under Blackpool Lights.  This film follows the two as they tour and most of the songs are cut short.  Also, Jack is very annoying.  He spends much of the time talking about what others have said about him and the band.  Who cares.  The negative reviews appear to really get at him.  Overall I recommend watching it but I would rent it instead.  The songs that are fully shown are really good and it is fun to see how they take on so much more risk than most bands.  If you want a concert disc go with Blackpool.
1401207529|5.0|Again another 5 star book. Great depiction of the upraising of Batman and his basic origin.
0061922315|5.0|Gowda's novel transports the reader to India and back with her tale of two families with a common bond---the love of a daughter.  Secret Daughter inspires thought, hope and a broadened perspective of the world while remaining appealing to those who are just looking for a great story.  The integrity of the author's writing keeps the reader engaged in the characters' lives---I couldn't put it down.  Wonderful, wonderful book club book!!!  I hope many more novels will follow from Gowda as I would buy them all with excitement and enthusiasm!

0060837551|5.0|I read this book over 20 years ago, and I never forgot that beautifull story , for long time I want to read that again. It is the best book I ever read.I sent this one to a friend, and I got another one for myself.   Just the best.
B001DUMHA2|5.0|Many listeners after hearing the tight arrangements on this album are surprised to hear that it was largely a spontaneous and improvised feat. This is what makes it a quintessential jazz album - the balance between form and improv. Miles was playing with some of his best players ever - Coltrane, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, Cannonball Adderly (on one track anyway) and James Cobb. He was at the top of his game - so much so that after the popularity of this album, he was driven forward into freer jazz while refusing to look back.
B00006830P|5.0|Who are the top three rock artists of all time ?  To my mind they are Elvis Presley, The Beatles and Bob Dylan.  And the top act is ... Bob Dylan!  Elvis started it all, but hardly wrote any of his songs.  His 1960s and 1970s recordings rarely matched his bomb shells of the 1950s.  The Beatles took the world by storm from 1963/1964 to their split in 1970.  They had 2 and then 3 top songwriters to propell them to the top.  Bob Dylan first significant recording, Blowin' In The Wind, proved to be just the tip of the iceberg as he has released more meaningful songs than either of his named rivals.  Highlights are nearly all the 36 tracks, although my wife thinks Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35 is fun and carefree, I don't agree!  Apart from the more odvious choices I love Positively 4th Street, Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window, I Shall Be Released and Blind Willie McTell.  Missing are I Threw It All Away, I Beleive In You and Every Grain Of Sand.  5 stars are not enough, I'd like to give it 10 !
B001OQCV2E|4.0|\\"2012\\"<br />------------------<br />This is a silly romp of a disaster thriller, a goofy-on-purpose homage to any number of 1970s-era disaster flicks (\\"Poseidon Adventure,\\" \\"Towering Inferno,\\" et al) with plenty of nods to other films as well (\\"The Ten Commandments,\\" \\"Close Encounters,\\" \\"Independence Day,\\" TV's \\"10.3\\"  and many, many more...) The filmmakers only briefly make any pretense that this is a serious film, but once Woody Harrelson's wacko pirate-radio conspiracy theorist character shows up to babble about the end of the world, the mood shifts into pure camp: a man tells his lover, \\"I feel like something's come between us,\\" and an earthquake opens a giant chasm between them... Ten minutes later, Los Angeles is sinking into the sea, with numerous LA in-jokes along the way. If you're looking for a white-knuckle, nail-biting action film, this certainly has spectacular special effects galore and a strong \\"how-can-we-top-THAT-one?\\" sensibility. There isn't much suspense -- you know things are going to get blown up, and that the effects are going to get bigger and bigger... But what it lacks in surprise, the film makes up in self-referential, over-the-top comedy. Some of it (Woody Harrelson) falls flat, but mostly this is a movie that works just fine i you take it on its own terms, as an action-flick parody, rather than as a straight-up action movie. I watched it on DVD, but I imagine it would have been a lot more fun in the theatres, where the entire audience could be in on the joke and laugh along together. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This should be required veiwing in every school. Kids would reallly know what is happening with their food and how the government has ruined the farming and food supply in the United States. While they force healthcare reform through the house, they are responsible for killing more people with their \\"cheap food\\" then anything other cause.
B000000Y87|5.0|I had been hearing for years about Bill Evans' trio recordings and particularly about these sessions at the VV, and of course, like every one else I'd heard and admired his work with Miles on \\"Kind of Blue\\". Well, it was worth the wait. It sounded great from the first listening. A must for every jazz fan's library. One for my top twenty jazz list. If you don't have it, buy it, you won't regret it. A shame about the young bassist dying so soon after, he was destined for great things.
B002WCLG3O|4.0|Really loved how the material on this Blue Ray/DVD fills in the gaps in the HALO story line and history of the conflict with the Covenant and the Flood. The animation is all very high quality, even the stylized chapter featuring the Arbiter and his conflict with the Prophets was well done. The Extras that feature game creators and authors of the books also adds great insight into the HALO universe. Made me want to go back and play through the games again and also looking forward to the new HALO Reach game that's coming out this year. I would recommend it to any fan of the game and/or the books who's looking for more background and insight on Master Chief, the UNSC and the Covenant's ongoing battle.
0307266303|5.0|This is the best book I've read in years ... and to think I wasn't even sure I'd care for it.  Not enjoying running is no reason to stay away from the book.  It has all sorts of sociological and anthropological insights into our mobility and reasons for related injuries that seem to be in abundance these days.  I'm lending my book out to some friends and telling everyone else I meet to get a copy.  Truly inspirational!

B001DPC52C|5.0|I am regrettably late to the Within Temptation party [and indeed, the entire genre of Euro female rock bands] - after watching this DVD and hearing their entire catalog, I am now inescapably hooked.    Within Temptation's Black Symphony concert is unquestionably one of the finest rock concert spectacles/presentations/live performances I have ever seen.    Sharon Den Adel's voice and stage presence puts nearly every other band's front-person to shame, the band is superlative, the inclusion of the Metropole Orchestra is inspired - the entire affair reeks of sheer joy and celebration, flawlessly executed by a musical group that is clearly having the time of their lives.    Just not enough superlatives to describe how I feel about Sharon, Within Temptation and this DVD performance.    Bravo, WT, bravo...
B001PJRAUS|4.0|OK. Now, everyone calm down. No, this is not a faithful adaptation of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Hint: It's not supposed to be. It's the crazy story of a modern-day woman who falls into the pages of her favorite Austen novel and screws everything up. Is it the best thing I have ever seen? No. Was I glued to my seat for the entire three hours? Yes. Did this movie have issues? You bet'cha. Do I recommend it? In the immortal words of Mr. Bennett in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" \\"read on\\":<br /><br />The hits:<br />1.) I loved the casting of Darcy. Not only was Elliot Cowan swoon-worthy (a pre-requisite in any Darcy casting), but the man could smolder with the best of them. Although, it must be said that this guy looks a lot like Stephen Moyer from \\"True Blood.\\"<br /><br />2.) I loved the twists and turns in this movie. You never knew where they were going to go next. There are three OMG bits, two oh-no-you-didn't parts, and a seriously loud screaming at the top of your lungs while clapping at the same time scene. (Believe me; you will know when you get to that last one especially.)<br /><br />3.) I loved the interaction between the new heroine, Amanda Price, and Mr. Darcy. I loved how she not only seemed to get beneath his skin (like Elizabeth in the book), but she dug even deeper than that. She could make that man scream at her and lose his composure completely. Now, I have always been of a mind that the person who can make you that nuts is the one you should marry. Yes, Elizabeth and Darcy were much wittier in the book, and it was a pleasure to the senses and all that, but it was refreshing to see Darcy knocked for such a loop that he would yell at a woman he barely knew. It was nice to see him come down off his pedestal a little quicker than he does in the book.<br /><br />4.) I loved that they made Miss Bingley is lesbian. It was totally inappropriate and wrong for her character, but I loved it nonetheless.<br /><br />The misses:<br />1.) The fact that so many of the manners of that time period were ignored and, at times, bulldozed over by Amanda---all with no one seeming to care. It seemed out of place to me that she would show up in modern clothes and it would take that long for anyone to make her change. There are also the copious amounts of make-up she wears, the overall lack of couth on her part, and her ignorance of the common manners of the time. This is supposed to be a woman who has practically memorized \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" She should know what the right thing to do is as well as the wrong. Then, there is the fact that a large number of these wrong things are not even commented on by anyone. Common trollops wore make-up back then, not proper misses. Ms. Bingley (as much as she disdains anyone without good breeding) would have publically chastised Amanda about this if no one else. And don't get me started on Amanda's hair . . .<br /><br />2.) The on-again/off-again engagements/weddings weren't realistic or even possible. That Mr. Collins would become engaged with Amanda and then just end it at the Netherfield ball is ridiculous. A man was pretty much cemented into an engagement once his proposal was accepted. A woman had a little more wiggle room here, but both parties would be subjected to harsh sanctions by society by \\"crying off\\" without some just and public cause. Then, there is the quick engagement between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley. (which is never really talked about again later now that I think about it.) How is it that Miss Bingley, a woman whose sole mission was to secure Darcy, would blithely let him go to be with someone else? Why would a man such as Darcy make such a reckless proposal in the first place? Plus, there is the fact that, once someone as prideful and correct as Darcy popped the question and was accepted, he would follow through on the marriage. There would be no choice. Last, the marriage between Mr. Collins and Jane is utterly moronic. That the man would not consummate the marriage is contrived (as much as the fact that he would happily dissolve the marriage just because Lady Catherine told him to). Parts like these seemed to be written in simply for shock value. It cheapened the movie overall, and irritated the crap out of me.<br /><br />3.) The idea that Bingley would fall for Amanda first is ludicrous. In the book, Bingley is beguiled at first by Jane's beauty, but falls in love with her sweet, gentle demeanor and overall generous presence. Since Amanda hasn't any of these qualities to recommend her, it felt a little foolish that Mr. Bingley would become enamored with her. Then, when you add the fact that Amanda gets drunk at the first assembly and makes out with Bingley in a darkened alley, you accelerate from ludicrous to the repeatedly-slapping-your-head-against-a-brick-wall-for-fun kind of stupid. I found myself screaming, \\"What the hell are you doing?\\" during that scene especially.<br /><br />4.) I hated how they turned Wickham into a good guy. C'mon! Everyone knows Wickham is the unrepentant bad boy, and, honestly, I love him because of that. If you notice, there is a bad boy in every one of Austen's novels. I think she, like the rest of her sex, had a tendre for them. Who doesn't? So, making him into the nice guy is akin to taking a stud horse, cutting off his Johnson, and putting him out in the paddock with all the mares. What is the point? (And, while I am pointing it out: Why make Georgiana---in the two scenes they gave her---into a lying brat? I hated that one especially).<br /><br />So, what is my recommendation? Well, if you are looking for a movie that is \\"faithful to the original classic tale\\" or some other such nonsense, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you are looking for a rollercoaster ride of fun, shock, and laughs, I highly recommend this piece of fluff. You will not believe the three hours have gone by this quickly and, whether you have issues with it or not, I guarantee you will be clapping at the end.uch as the fact that he would happily dissolve the marriage just because Lady Catherine told him to).

1591843162|5.0|I like Seth Godin, because I have seen many of his video presentations and only one of his books in times past. But this one... if you read no other Seth book... no other book from anyone else... Read this one Book.   Talk about a book for our times! Read it just the information in the front, where Seth talks about how we all got into this economic mess we find ourselves in today. Why there once was a time when no body in the world had a 'job' so Seth posses the question... why should anyone need one now? Why do we need industrialization and factories and all the 'trappings' of our modern world... and above all Why our world has made us believe... \\"that we are NOT indispensable\\"... That \\"you can be replaced\\" at any time... and how that has effected our modern lives today. This is the book that will change the world for the next century. It's about work, it's about ideas, it's about Art and how we all CAN and SHOULD be working toword and being thought of by others as indispensable linchpins.

B002ZHKZEM|4.0|The DVD set arrived in good time and in good order.  No worries what-so-ever.  Some of the story lines seemed just a bit weak.  The one on Mars I think would have been the weekest one with the last double episode being the best.  I have been hoping for ages that they would find a way to bring back the Time Lords.  I hope they have been incorporated into the adventures of the newest incarnation of the Doctor.  Here's to hoping!!!
142312166X|4.0|The beauty of the Percy Jackson series is that your kids will enjoy and you will too. I love the short stories contained in this book.It definatly is nice to see more of some of the other characters. The interviews and 'extras' however, were definatly more geared towards the kids and that is ok as it states that in the age range for the book. I still recomend buying it especially if you have children who love the series.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been working out for years - at least 5 days a week 45 minutes a day and I needed to change up my workout because my body got used to my routine.  I bought all 3 videos and I am so glad I did.  It is amazing!  I rotate between all 3 of them and mix in jogging, yoga, the elliptical, and biking.  I usually don't believe in DVD workouts but this is the exception to the rule.

B002SJIO4A|4.0|A friend of mine and I were sharing opinions about District 9. I liked it better than I thought I would. He thought it was brilliant. He wrote that it was a very incarnational film. This was a definite theme. The main character was contaminated by a liquid and he was slowly being turned into an alien. The man had insights into the human condition and the alien condition that he never had before. He was selfish and became sacrificial at the end. Another example, the gangster wanted to eat alien flesh so that he could become an alien. The bad military officer was eaten at the end. Some of the aliens were more humane than any of the humans.     The movie's newsreel style was a slight turn off at the beginning, but it grew on me. The foreshadowing was a key part of the picture. Hinting at regular intervals at what was coming, kept my interest in the movie. The special effects were very good. The character development, except for the main character, was very limited. The mother ship just hanging over the city was a cool special effect. The parallels of the treatment of aliens in the movie and apartheid were strange.     The movie is deeper than one thinks at an initial viewing. The movie stays with me and I keep coming back to the themes it presents. The movie is very subtle in some ways. I strongly recommend the movie.
0937381888|5.0|Great, possibly best book on homebrewing I've found. The title had me worried that it contained only basic brewing information, but it actually has detailed information on just about everything I care to learn about homebrewing from 20-minute boil kits to all-grain brewing. Get it, you won't be disappointed.
B002ZTQVGQ|2.0|FIrst off I half to say I love the story of the little mermaid. I also really love director of this movie. But I really didn't care for the story line. I was hoping for a little more adventure like in Howl's moving castle.<br />The animation is beautiful and outstanding.

B001EAWMGA|5.0|I was going to give it 4 stars. Then, I watched the 41 minutes of deleted scenes included in the extras and decided to give it 5 stars. It is baffling that the deleted scenes were not included in the original release. They add a nostalgic NORSE mythological touch to the film. The additional scenes show beautiful nature, the religious habits of the Norsemen, the story and plot are much deeper. When it is released with the deleted scenes i will purchase the extended release. This is a classic.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I watched season 2 and became so addicted I had to purchase season 1 to not only catch up on what I had missed, but also cause I can't get enough of the show. Now I can't wait for season 2 to com out on DVD.
B001QOGYFO|3.0|Some interesting footage of Antarctica. The film seems to rush a bit. You don't get a feel for the charters. It was more like a TV drama then a motion picture. A throwback to the old cop dramas where we are told to ponder if  a female cop can handle the work. Based upon a graphic novel/comic book as most movies seem to be of late this was an OK mystery.
0764207407|5.0|Sense and Sensibility is the classic tale of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who share a remarkable bond of love despite their differences.  Marianne is given to emotionalism; Elinor is refined and self-controlled.  Both women indulge in unhealthy extremes of these mindsets throughout the story and yet they find that they are in many ways alike as they walk through life and search for love.<br /><br />Jane Austen is one of my favorite historical authors.  Her characters are real and I found that I could identify with Marianne especially.  The only thing I found to be questionable was the presence of Margaret. She was rarely present and did not seem to contribute much to the story.<br /><br />The version of this book that I read was very insightful.  Throughout the story there were notes in the side margin that explained certain words that may have been unfamiliar to some readers.  The notes also mentioned parallels between Jane's life and the lives of her characters.  Having seen the 1995 version of the movie, I had some expectations as to what the book would be like.  As with most films that are based on books, I found that I enjoyed the book more than the movie simply because the book gives so much more depth to the characters and their situations.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|An entertaining film with fine production design and costumes. Miklos Rozsa's score for El Cid is one of composer's greatest achievements. The widescreen picture is enhanced for 16:9 TVs and of very high quality.
0812550706|5.0|I understand that you don't want to stop reading what ever your in the middle of so I will just ask you to make this the next book you read. I don't think I have ever read a more direct author. He wastes no time with the narrative. I don't need the language flowered up to enjoy a book. I'm not saying that this is always bad, but I like to focus on plot more. Well, anyway, Card is just in your face this whole book. I love authors like this. Very easy to read. You will not regret it. I want to make sure that you know that he does a great job with character development as well. It may sound like there is only story, but the truth is that the character's life and the story are so tightly intertwined that you really get both at the same time. Also a really good twist at the end and this is always welcome.
0393072231|5.0|This is an outstanding book. I could not put it down. I think only about 10 percent of the book gets involved on a technical level. Hence, even someone with basic knowledge of the financial markets should enjoy the book. Michael Lewis takes his readers through a cast of characters who were mostly involved on the periphery of the financial crisis. Lewis does an outstanding job walking you through the thought process and people who foresaw the crisis that most other people missed. The book is not just a recount of the financial crisis like the countless books that have been released in the past year. It is a witty, well research, thought provoking book that looks at the financial crisis from a whole different perspective.

0307463745|5.0|The following was originally posted on my blog [..]    Rework is what I'm going to call a new business book. It aims to rewrite the rules of succeeding in business with a fresh, down-to-earth approach. In all 12 chapters the authors give advice contrary to everything you've been taught about business success. (\\"Emulate drug dealers? Huh?\\") They aren't saying these things just to be different, though. They make sense. That's what so promising about this new business crowd. How we've learned in the past has been based on trust and tradition; the future is based on logic through proof and transparency.    Rework is a quick read. It has big margins, illustrations, and short rapid-fire sentences. But the amount of experience and great advice is equal to that of a book three times its size. With topics ranging from productivity to progress to hiring to promotion, even to damage control, practicality soaks every page. And nobody could say it better than Jason Fried himself: \\"Concise is what we do. No one should be reading a business book for days. Read quick and get back to work\\".    Rework teaches to be as small (and thus agile) as possible, seek outside funding only when absolutely necessary, and make money rather than spend it.  This book isn't for everyone, though. Some people's definition of success is lots of employees, fancy offices and big bureaucratic board rooms filled with executives and departments. Some people love the thrill of finding venture capital. These things go against the efficiency mantra preached here. Rework teaches to be as small (and thus agile) as possible, seek outside funding only when absolutely necessary, and make money rather than spend it. These are the kinds of ideas a profit-minded individual should have lots of fun implementing, and why this book is a must-read for anyone that owns a business, is thinking about owning a business, or even works for a business.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I agree with the reviews that rate this album 5* and 1*. I love her singing and several of the selections give me goose bumps (5 Stars). But I was disappointed that she was not \\"allowed\\" to let loose as she did on her BGT performance. Her songs felt reserved, as if she was \\"holding back\\". The backgrounds often drownded out her voice. (2 Stars) I hope these flaws were the result of trying to get this album out in time for Christmas. I look forward to Album #2. I hope the studio will have more time to iron out the production issues and she will have more studio singing experience.  All in all though, I thoroughly enjoy this album!

B0035G9ABQ|4.0|For all of you who do not know, Gorillaz is an animated electronic rock-rap group created by Damon Albarn, who is best known as the frontman of Blur (also known as the \\"Song 2\\" Band).  The \\"group's\\" 3rd album Plastic Beach follows suit with its predecessor's as being a unique mix of Rap, Electronica, and Rock.    Some songs are more successful with blending these genres than others, with one or two songs stretching on too long and too repetitively.  That said, other songs simply soar creatively.  Songs like \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\" and \\"On Melancholy Hill\\" sound like something you won't hear anywhere else. Unlike the previous Gorillaz albums, Plastic Beach does not seem to have a single that will appeal to the mass market, but don't let that deter you from experiencing an otherwise very enjoyable album.      Plastic Beach, like every other Gorillaz album, is loaded to the gills with guest artist. There is no shortage of star power with guest like Snoop Dogg and Mos Def.  The problem with this is, their previous albums felt like a cohesive band with its own voice, Plastic Beach feels like a compilation of many different artist on admittedly well produced song.    That said, Plastic Beach really is a good album.  All of the songs are very enjoyable in their own right, but the lack of unity holds it back from its true potential.
B002RKS81O|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

B002EWD0I6|5.0|This is delightful!  There are so many wonderful characters:  Dorcas Lane, Robert, Emma, and Laura Timmins, Alf Arless, Queenie Turrill...and on and on.  BBC has produced a captivating story of two communities, one a farming village and one a small marketing town.  It is quality viewing for the entire family...no worries about inappropriate language or situations.  I have watched all the episodes several times.  This ranks at the top with Cranford!
B0039UTDFG|3.0|Watched the first two episodes on Discovery Channel and... very disappointed that Discovery and BBC let Oprah narrate the U.S. version of Life.  For sure, they want her audience of millions.  Still, she may be the queen of talk-shows but definitely not a narrator voice for such top notch nature show like this.  I will definitely order the British version with Sir Attenborough. He brings so much more \\"life\\", natural fluidity, much more convincing, and great credibility to such an awesome show.

Since HDMI cables carry a digital signal, the cheaper materials do not compromise the quality of the audio and video.

Wayne Dyer has been my guru for years, and Deepak Chopra and Echart Tolle are threads within the same weave.  Tolle's \\"A New Earth\\" is also amazing. It sits alongside my bible. The Power of Now and A New Earth should be in everybody's library if you can hold on to them. These are the types of books you want to give to everybody you know and even people you don't. If I was Oprah, I'd do just that.  Enjoy the journey.

The diagrams and drawings of the buildings, temples, towns, etc. provide another layer of understanding to the texts.  Also, the maps are very well done to provide further understanding to the Georgraphy of the times.  I really enjoy reading this Bible!  I feel like I learn so much more each time I read it.  It has rekindled my desire to get into the word.  Also, the online sites is an excellent resource.  With this Bible, you get a card to login to the ESV study Bible online.  The site is free for anyone even if not a purchaser of the Bible.  However, if you login with the code, you get access to all of the notes online as well.  This makes reading even easier with the ability to click on the notes to quickly reference other references and notes in the text.  You can also add highlights and notes into the text for your own personal online Bible translation.  I could not be more pleased with this Bible.<br />  I read the earlier comments about poor quality control on the printed copies that some purchasers had received.  I thoroughly reviewed mine when I received it, and I did not have any issues at all with mine.<br />  Again, I could not be more pleased with this Bible.  I hope you enjoy yours as much as I enjoy mine.
B00007LTIG|4.0|The first Dead album is sometimes criticized for being too speedy. But this is part of what I love about it. The music is from a young, energetic band just emerging from the Haight-Ashbury scene and ready to mix their folk, blues and country roots with psychedelic rock experimentation.     \\"The Golden Road\\" captures that youthful hippie spirit at it's best and Pigpen's confident vocals and playing on \\"Good Morning Little School Girl\\" show just how important he was to the early Dead's sound. \\"Cream Puff War\\" is one of Jerry Garcia's few efforts as a lyricist before bringing in brillant wordsmith Robert Hunter. It's a decent song but I still think Garcia's later partnership with Hunter was a wise move and helped take the Dead to the next level in terms of songwriting. Among the covers I especially love is \\"Viola Lee Blues\\" which I consider among the very best songs on the album    In addition there is the excellent bonus material and much improved sound quality achieved by remastering. I'm subtracting a star only because the Dead would record even better albums in the future. But this truly is both an important historical document of an extremely influential period in American music and culture along with a fine collection of songs that stand on their own. Highly recommended.

B002VECMAE|5.0|After making serious political films like [[ASIN:B000F7CMRM Syriana (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000E1NXJ0 Good Night, and Good Luck (Widescreen Edition)]], it's nice to see George Clooney starring in a political satire that is funny but still has something to say as it shows the absurdity of the war in Iraq. The Men Who Stare at Goats falls under the truth is stranger than fiction category as it presents a story populated by eccentric characters and tall tales, some of which might be true. Regardless, it is an entertaining film with a wonderfully oddball sense of humor. Don't be put off by the setting. Although it takes place in Iraq, The Men Who Stare at Goats is not weighed down by the baggage of this war.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by the film's director Grant Heslov. He points out certain characters that are composites but is quick to explain that what they say comes from Jon Ronson's book [[ASIN:1439181772 The Men Who Stare at Goats]]. He sometimes spends too much time telling us where certain scenes were shot which gets tiresome pretty fast. Heslov's focus is mostly on the nuts and bolts of filmmaking but done in a fairly dry and uninteresting way.<br /><br />Also included is a commentary by the book's author Jon Ronson. He points out the scenes that are based on real incidents and talks about meeting the actual people that the characters are based on. He also explains who the composite characters are and tells all sorts of fascinating anecdotes. If you want to learn more the people and events behind the ones depicted in the film, this is worth a listen if only to find out how much is taken from his book and experiences.<br /><br />\\"Goats Declassified: The Real Men of the First Earth Battalion\\" features some of the actual military personnel depicted The Men Who Stare at Goats. They talk about some of their intentions. We also learn about how this top secret unit's techniques were brought to light.

0984334904|5.0|White Rabbit Press produces the best flashcards for learning Kanji and Japanese vocabulary in the world. A bold statement that the cards on my desk verify. Over the years, I have tried off and on to learn Japanese and often get discouraged by Kanji and made it fun and easy. I highly recommend anyone with an interest and desire to learn Japan pick these cards up.  1. High quality cards with a great feel in the hand. The cards are built to last, which is extremely helpful as you cycle through the various cards to pick up all the kanji.  2. The design is simply sleek and cool. Who would have thought flashcards would make you feel fashionable? The amount of time taken on the packaging, graphics on the cards and layout scream class.   3. The cards are extremely informative, each card is dual-sided and layered with information that is accessible and not daunting. This includes the Kanji itself, similar kanji,  a nice illustration of the stroke order and  various examples of the kanji usage in various words. The flip side of the card explains the meaning of everything on the front. Simply put, it is outstanding and easy to read.  4. WRP really cares about its customers and highlight they are really making something special for you, the Japanese learner. It is evident in the language used in the none kanji cards, including the cool \\"Tell a friend\\" cards in the set.  I highly recommend getting these cards and the matching poster if your serious about learning Japanese. You will not be disappointed.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|En mi opini&oacute;n, un excelente reparto, una muy buena trama, muy apegada a los relatos originales de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, con acci&oacute;n, cambios vertiginosos de secuencias, el carisma innato y la antisociedad tan caracter&iacute;sticos de Sherlock Holmes. Fascinante el nuevo rol del Dr. Watson, siempre mostrado como un gordito bonach&oacute;n, ex heroe de las campa&ntilde;as en Africa y m&eacute;dico de profesi&oacute;n, ahora un tipo delgado, excelente luchador y mucho mas din&aacute;mico que su figura literaria. Y Lestrade? el \\"gordo y fofo brazo de la ley\\" como siempre lo describ&iacute;a Holmes, sin mencionar a la hermosa Irene Adler, \\"la mujer\\", esa hermosura que cautivo al unico hombre en el mundo que pensaba en atrapar a un criminal mas que en seducir a una mujer, jajaja. Un buen trabajo, una buena pel&iacute;cula, digna de colecci&oacute;n. Solo espero que la edici&oacute;n de blu-ray y DVD est&eacute; a la altura.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I just don't get it. Why replace the marvelous narration by David Attenborough with Oprah's? Do the folks at the Discovery Channel think that Americans can't understand Attenborough's accent? Other than trying to cash in on Oprah's name, I can't think of a reason why they decided to ruin this incredible series. I'll pass on this version and stick to the original BBC release the same way I did with Planet Earth.

B002KSPKRS|1.0|This headset is not worth the money!! The headset feels cheap and heavy on your head. Also makes ears warm and sweat. The sound was alright, not great. Sound settings do not really change the sound all that much. Friends said I was echoing on xbox live chat. And about chat, if I'm paying $200 for a wireless headset, why do I still have to plug a cable into my xbox controller for chat??? Not really wireless now is it? I have a wireless network set up at home for my computers, xbox is directly plugged into router. All of a sudden, I started getting incredibly slow transfer rates between computers. I tried changing settings(router, computers), nothing helped. Guess what? It was the headset transmitter interfering with my router!!! When I turned it off, everything started working again the way it is suppose to. These things make hissing noises, popping noises, and other noises. There are no rechargeable batteries. I will never buy Turtle Beach again. There are other headsets that are way more cheaper and better.

Where the other books felt a bit sophomoric, this, like it's hero Percy Jackson, seems to have matured, and with it seems capable of capturing a larger audience. Percy's race to beat the evil Luke and thwart his plan to overthrow all of Olympia leads he and his rag tag crew of friends into the heart of the famed Labyrinth, in an attempt to be the first to reach the master inventor Daedalus, their only hope to win the war of good vs evil. Fast paced, and filled with one thrill after another Riordan builds to a climax that sets up the final book for what is sure to be an explosive conclusion.

1416575464|5.0|My husband and I were tired of living like grad students, so I bought this book.  I never read the magazine and knew NOTHING about decorating.  Somehow, after flipping through it a few times, I felt confident to attack the apartment.  One month later, we now live like adults, and I love coming home to our organized home with real furniture.  I found the book so accessible and sensible in terms of costs (no telling me to drop a couple grand on an armchair or whatever... unless I want to) and effort (no one suggesting I retile my own floor).<br /><br />I can't speak for people who already know what they're doing in terms of interior design, but for a novice like me, this book has been worth every penny.
0805091742|5.0|Dr. Gawande has written another book that is not just enjoyable to read but actually helpful to the reader.  But note:  You do NOT have to be in the medical field to benefit from reading this book.  Gawande spends a great deal of time addressing other industries that can or do benefit from checklists.    A couple of comments:    *  I am a cardiac nurse, a fairly new one, and when I started working as a nurse, I made a checklist that I use for each patient I'm assigned.  The list makes sure I address the key aspects needed to properly care for the patient AND that the patient's case is actually moving forward.      I've been made fun of by other nurses because of this list.  It doesn't matter.  I have lost count of the number of things it has helped me catch in patient care and at least when I am assigned a patient, things get done.    *  I cannot begin to stress how impressed I am with Dr. Gawande and his openness at admitting mistakes.  If you have never worked in health care, I can ASSURE you that surgeons and most doctors simply do not admit to errors or mistakes.  Ever.  They act as if they are perfect and omniscient and nurses and others are treated as if they are 8th grade drop-outs.      But Dr. Gawande is different.  He's actually better.  His admission of things he's overlooked or errors he's made make you want to be better at what you do.  Why?  Because you know if someone like him, who embodies excellence, can make mistakes and come out better in the end, you can too.      *  A very, very small quibble.  In the beginning of the book, Dr. Gawande discusses a \\"Mr. DeFilippo.\\"  When you read that section, you could be forgiven for thinking that patients in ICUs are constantly surrounded by doctors/intensivists providing care, titrating powerful drips, examining and changing dressings, the lines, etc.      That may be the case in some hospitals but in MOST hospitals, the doctors are in the ICUs for several minutes per day.  That's it.  Why?  Because they havea lot of other work to do elsewhere.  What does that mean?  It means that it is a nurse who is constantly providing you with care, never leaving your ICU room, titrating powerful medications, watching and managing your incisions and lines, and making sure all your numbers look ok.  Patients and families come into the ICU and are always shocked to find that the doctors are rarely there.      The point?  Dr. Gawande's checklists MUST be incorporated by a variety of practices in health care simply because the doctors only provide a slice of the total amount of care given to a patient. If you are coming in for \\"simple\\" pacemaker insertion, you can rest assured that over 50 people are going to be involved in providing you care.  You are only going to see about 15 of those people over the course of your 36-48 hour stay.  But those other 35 people have a huge impact on your care.  You want their work to be right.  Not just the doctor's.  So take to heart what Dr. Gawande suggests:  start designing a good checklist!
B00000DI06|4.0|I was introduced to this piece rather recently and wanted to hear it in its entirety - due in no small part to the fact that the soprano solos are quite tricky.  The Cambridge Singers, under the baton of Rutter himself, give a very true rendering with meticulous attention to the straight tone sound for which Rutter is so fond.  Although this was purchased primarily as a learning tool, Rutter's unusual and often haunting harmonies are a welcome addition to my rather eclectic listening collection.
B001OQCV2O|2.0|2012 isn't a Disaster Movie...it's a Movie Disaster! But...my kids liked it. Perhaps because the acting and script writing were childish at best.<br /><br />I did give 2012 an extra star for the special effects, but even some of the FX were lacking. Roland Emmerich's last Disaster Movie effort in 2004 called [[ASIN:B000VDDWE2 The Day After Tomorrow]] was much better, or, eh, not as stupid as 2012. The Day After Tomorrow got really stupid after the part where we were all to believe that Dennis Quaid could survive a walk from Washington DC north to NY City through weather that was, what was it supposed to be?...100-something degrees below zero Fahrenheit? Well, Emmerich and his team of writers took dumb to the dumber level with 2012. Gotta at least give him a C for consistency I guess.<br /><br />2012 was stupid right from the starting gun: from the highly unbelievable hiking trek by John Cusack's family into government restricted areas, to unrealistic aerial acrobatics by under-skilled pilots, to the eventual premise that \\"someone\\" would be somewhat prepared for this kind of disaster but only save politicians and royalty.<br /><br />Oh don't worry, none the above will spoil the movie for you; it'll do that all by itself. The only fun in this movie is watching the special effects unfold. 2012 is no collector's item so save your money. See this on cable on a rainy day when there is absolutely nothing else on.

B002VECMAE|3.0|George Clooney, Ewen McGregor, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey, Robert Patrick, Stephen Root, Stephen Lang...THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS has an one of the best cast lineups of any 2009 film (a year in which a lot of good actors made a lot of good movies).  The film is based around a supposedly true plot: \\"psychic warriors\\" trained to fight terrorists, led by a hippie soldier, attacked by an arrogant Army officer, and infiltrated by a bored investigative reporter and a former psychic soldier.  It makes for a great story, and overall, GOATS succeeds brilliantly; it is a delightful, at times dark film (the last 20 minutes or so get so dark, you'll wish the whole film had been this gutsy) that proposes a lot of questions, and doesn't bother answering them (like any good satire should).<br /><br />However, something's lacking.  Peter Straughan's script isn't up to par; and Grant Heslov's directing seems at times undecided.  The acting is fine--Clooney is understated; Bridges is himself; Spacey is delightfully off-kilter; and watching McGregor deadpan the question \\"What's a Jedi?\\" is just good geeky fun--but the film itself doesn't live up to the cast's combined talents.  The end result is a film that's certainly an enjoyable watch, even laugh-out-loud funny in spots (though it's overall a subtle comedy; this isn't slapstick, it's satire), but doesn't have the lasting effect something with this weight should.  The ending is ultimately a let-down; a lot of build up for very little.  That's not to say the movie isn't worth your time; if you enjoy intellectual comedies, you'll definitely want to check it out.  However, unlike others of the genre--DR. STRANGELOVE comes to mind, though it's probably unfair to compare any war satire to Kubrick's masterpiece--THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS doesn't stay with you once you're done watching.  And that is a damn shame, because a film with this great a cast, and this interesting a premise, deserves--almost necessitates--a lasting presence.  As is, we have an enjoyable intelligent comedy that is slightly less than the sum of its parts.ave an enjoyable intelligent comedy that is slightly less than the sum of its parts.
0385532458|3.0|I enjoyed reading each of the seven short stories in John Grisham's Ford County. Grisham writes crisply on these pages, providing readers with just the right amount of description and character development. He delivers well-told stories here, with characters that are memorable and situations that reveal the breadth of human behavior. While I have been entertained by some, but not all, of Grisham's novels, I found these stories to be engaging and entertaining and recommend them to any reader who enjoys a well-written story.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
0743289692|5.0|This incredible story is one of such courage!  I couldn't put the book down.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|This is my favorite new show! A depiction of the roman empire at its best. Andy Whitfield is impressive as Spartacus. Superb action scenes, intrigue, lust, what do you want more .... ;-))   check out this series!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|As usual, the purchase from Amazon was great with free shipping.  This DVD of Michael is FABULOUS.  I didn't expect the rehearsals to be so elaborate.  It was if it were a concert.  Michael had not lost a thing in the 10 years since he had last preformed.  He was excellent with his singing and dancing. It was also nice to see how a rehearsal for a tour is conducted and the many people that it takes to do a production like this.  It was also almost 2 hours long and it is so nice to have this DVD, watch it whenever I want in the convenience of my home as opposed to going to the movie theatre and seeing it once.  The DVD was the same price as going to the theatre.  A good purchase.  We will definitely miss Michael Jackson as he was without a doubt one of best entertainers of all time.  It is a shame that he was so misunderstood.
B00168OIOE|5.0|If you have a HD-TV and a Blu-Ray player, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie in 1080p.  It's stunning!  I put the movie in for my girls, and ended up sitting there watching the whole thing.  The detail was so crisp and clear.  I was blown away.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This movie is hilarious and really fun! I wasn't an old Star Trek fan, so I wasn't sure but it was great!
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Could have been a great movie. Special effects were great, the whole idea was good, but turning Cusak into the next Rambo was ridiculous. The story line was terrible!!!!! At least I did not spend money going to the movies for this one!!
B0027CSNBM|4.0|I think this gave you another side of the characters and further stories to keep you going. I love the charcter of Clarrissa and glad that they did something further with her. I love the character of Percy and want to see him continue to grow and flurish as a hero, son and friend.
B001EYU1VO|1.0|Started by having an hard time to get it to work on Windows 7 64, the throttle is stiff, and it ended up breaking after 2 weeks of normal usage ( from 30-to 1 hr daily usage, Falcon 4 ). What happened is that all of a sudden the rudder control was going off  randomly. Returned for a refund and the shipping costed me a whopping 17$ ( although the estimate cost was 6$). Definitely won't order hardware from Amazon again unless they start giving free shipping of returns.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I went to see \\"This Is It\\" in the movie the day it came out and another time after that. I will say that I loved every minute of it. I have been a Michael Jackson fan since day one. This man put his life in his music and what he was planning for his comeback concerts would of been amazing. His tours just kept getting better. I honestly believe that this tour would of made it to the United States and it would been my favorite of all his tours. My favorite tour by Michael is \\"The Dangerous Tour\\". These are rehearsal footages, he is not on point because it is rehearsal. In this movie, you can tell what kind of person Michael is, deep inside. He was so humble, loving, and caring. Looks like he never got angry with his employees, during certain songs, he would ask to \\"let's try it one more time\\", \\"that's ok, thats why we have rehearsal\\", and he was so funny at times \\"putting more booty into it\\". Michael has always been one of my favorites and he will always remain of my favorites.    1. Wanna Be Startin Somethin  This song was included on all of his solo tours and the Jacksons \\"Victory Tour, opening the tours on the \\"Victory Tour\\" and \\"Bad Tour\\". It was the second song on setlist on the \\"Dangerous Tour\\" and fourth song on the \\"History Tour\\". Since there was no new album, this is the perfect way to start the show, \\"with a bang\\". You can tell how happy he is to be back on stage again, he enjoyed what he was doing. It's hard to believe this guy was 50 years old. During the break of the song, he sings an accapella version of \\"Speechless\\", from the 2001 album \\"Invincible\\". Here you can see how pure and beautiful Michael's voice is. After, you see dancer auditions and how Michael always wanted the best of the best and thats exactly what he recieved.     2. Jam  The last time Michael performed this was on the \\"Dangerous Tour\\". He puts alot of energy into this song, the rap part of the song is cut short but still the rehearsal was still great. Showing ideas of using \\"the toaster\\", from what he used on the \\"Dangerous Tour\\". I had heard that Michael was supposed to be play a montage of the \\"Jam\\" video on the big screens on the back. He even did the break of the song chreography correct, it was well on packed. He includes a snippet of \\"Another Part Of Me\\" in the song, during the break of the chereography.     3. They Don't Care About Us  This had to have been one of my favorite parts of the show, with the new video made of 100,000 army soliders, which was only 10 dancers multiplied. Michael put alot of energy into this song and this where you can see him behind the scences working with several producers, trying to get it perfect. I love how at the beginning of the song, he has the military chreography, which just brillant!! Towards the end of the performance, he includes a snippet of the songs \\"Why You Wanna Trip On Me?\\" & \\"She Drives Me Wild\\". Which I am glad he included a snippet of those songs.    4. Human Nature  This song is one of favorite Michael Jackson songs of all time. He used his vocals hard on this song and it would of came out great. He shows off newer dance moves, which you've never seen him do before. During the middle of the song, he goes into the silence of the song and comes back with \\"until the night time\\", and finshes the rest of the song.     5. Smooth Criminal  This was my favorite part of the show. Not only he digitally puts himself in the movie \\"Gilda\\" while Ray Hayworth sings \\"Put the Blame On Me\\", its in 3D as well. You can see how he was a true artist, because he would feel the video turn the city scence. You can still tell that Michael had it in him, after all he had been through. Even though the \\"lean\\" was not rehearsed, it was supposed to be in part of the actual show.     6. The Way You Make Me Feel  Right before the actual rehearsal of the song, you see Michael really at work. Telling the musical director, it has to sound \\"like I wrote it, how the record plays and how the audience hears it\\". Like \\"your dragging yourself out of bed\\". As the tone gets right, he makes sure the growl comes at his command, and not automatically. He wants it to \\"let it simmer\\" and let it bay in the moonlight\\". As the song starts, his dancers climb down from a 3-D skyscraper and Michael comes out in his \\"signature\\" blue shirt, follows a girl around and ends it with the original chereography from the video, Michael still had it. I loved that part of the song.    7. I Want You Back/The Love You Save/I'll Be There  Michael goes back old school with the Jackson 5 hits and you can see that he loves it, because of the huge smile on his face. The only thing is that he ask if the sound can be brought down lower because of the inner ears, when Michael last toured, he was just used to of the human ear volume. When \\"I'll Be There\\" was sang, I believe just about everyone in theater got chills down there spine. Honestly, I would say it almost brought tears to my eyes. Michael was just so humble. At the end of the song, he named \\"Jackie, Marlon, Tito, Jermaine,Randy\\" and I love You. Joseph and Katherine, I Love You.    8. Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground)  Even though there was not any real vocals done here, the chereography was great. During the song, there was a snippet of \\"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough\\" included.     9. I Just Can't Stop Loving You  Michael was so humble and great person. He was so comical as well, towards the beginning of the song he started to sing it in Spanish. The song was a duet with one of the back up singers. The song came out great and he put so much passion into his performance. At the end of the song, he stated \\"I have to save my voice\\", and the band told him \\"you better sing boy\\". Makes you laugh.     10. Thriller  This was just an awesome part of the movie, the entire video was re-shot and was put in graphics ahead of it's time. Towards the end of the song, a black widow spider comes out on stage and what do you know, Michael pops out of it. It was brillant! He starts outwith the main chereography from \\"Thriller\\". At the end of the song, it includes a snippet of the song \\"Ghosts\\" from the \\"Blood On The Dance Floor\\" album and also a snippet from the song \\"Threatened\\" from the album \\"Invincible\\".     11. Beat It  Another brillant part of the show! With the fire chasers, it was just amazing! The fire works at the beginning, it was just amazing. He performs the classic chereography to the song and it comes out great, he performs the second verse of the song. He ends it with. \\"let it burn, lights out\\". He was supposed to take off his jacket, set it on fire, and lights out. Michael was just pure genius!    12. Black Or White  I just loved this part, Michael looked like he was enjoying this part as well. Another part of the movie, where you know Michael was a true perfectionist. He started it all over, \\"wanted to try it one more time\\". On the back screens, you can see the original video playing and at the end of the song, it ends with a new hard rock encore.    13. Earth Song  This was amazing! A new 3D video was created and where you can hear Michael talk about the planet, it's really touching to hear him talk. Michael was so commited to healing the world, and he wasn't fake at all about it. The song was suppose to end with a large tractor coming on state and, in his words \\"when that doors opens in silence, you start that piano\\".    14. Billie Jean  Aww, what can I say what hasn't been said before. Pure genius! Michael was enjoying this song and at the end he told the dancers \\"that's just a preview of what you'll get for now\\" He did not do his signature moonwalk, he was saving it for the actual shows. Michael was full of energy on this song.     15. Man In The Mirror  The perfect song to end with, he ended his \\"Bad & Dangerous Tours\\" with this song. It was going to end perfectly, with the 3D \\"MJ Air\\" video, and it would of been just brillant show.    I recommend getting this movie, because it is just brillant and will make you want moreand more. I hope they do release the rehearsal footage for the other songs that were rehearsed, such as \\"Rock With You\\", \\"Dirty Diana\\", \\"You Rock My World\\", \\"Heal The World\\", \\"Dangerous\\", \\"You Are Not Alone\\", & \\"Will You Be There?\\". You also get the bonus features, which includes interviews with all the cast and you can view all the costumes Michael was supposed to wear on the tour.     Michael Jackson was and will forever remain the King of Pop! No one will ever replace him! Long live the King!
B00009P1O0|5.0|Compared with the preceding Neil Young album \\"Harvest\\", \\"On the Beach\\" marks a pretty significant style in change. Where \\"Harvest\\" was generally a very melodic and catchy album, with strong roots in country music, the songwriting here is very much \\"Down to Earth\\", leaning strongly on the blues, and at times quite similar to the style of Bob Dylan.<br /><br />One song sticks pretty much out from the rest; the beautiful \\"See the Sky about to Rain\\", which is a lot in the style of \\"Harvest\\" and also a personal favorite of mine.<br /><br />Another very memorable track is the closing song \\"Ambulance Blues\\" which sounds like a song that Lou Reed could have written.Other favorites are \\"Walk On\\" and the acoustic \\"For the Turnstiles\\"<br /><br />All songs are worthwhile, of course, and the album is another good example that  you'll never know which way Neil Young will go next. Lyrically the songs are often dark and disillutioned.<br /><br />Among the musicians you will find prominent names as David Crosby, Graham Nash and Rick Dank and Levon Helm from the Band.
B000LPS4BG|4.0|A Classisic every home should have this movie in their home movie library[[ASIN:B002UOMGVU Goodfellas (20th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]]
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe is one of J.J. Abrams better ideas. Fringe has all the elements of a successful series, action, deep character devleopment, humor, intrigue, grief, and humanity. For those fans of X-Files that were missing their dose of reality mixed with insanity, this is it on steriods. Do not miss the opportunity to to go over this series and discover the small things that add up to so much more and make the story line an intracate weave of possibilities. Torv, Jackson, and Reddick are perfect for their roles and make the story all that much more engaging. All I can say is this is masterful TV.
1934429376|5.0|i had had my eye on the original LARGE \\"illustrated life\\" for over 3 years, but it was #1: always too pricey, and #2: where can i put it, it's huge!  this smaller version is still large enough to use as a coffee table book, but not so large that it requires it's very own table.  the paper is high quality and the drawings are all the same as in the other version.  i love it.
B002LBKDYE|5.0|This movie is a must see!!! It Does not show the butchering of the animals and it's not all about how the animals are mis treated it's a WAY BIGGER picture than that!!! It 's about what the food industry isn't telling you about what actually is in your food!!! What you may be feeding your kids!!! Everyone has the right to know what's in their food and how their food is being processed!!! You think it's gross if you're out eating somehere and the cook drops your food on the floor or he/she didn't wash their hands before handling your food well do you ever wonder how your food was processed before even getting Into that restaurant?!? Or what kind of chemicals or how many antibiotics they put on your food before it got into the grocery store you shop at?!?! everyone has a right to know and the food industry has kept it behind a curtain for too long!!! This movie did not make me a vegetarian or vegan not that any of them are bad!! Bravo to those who can give up meat!! I just am so much more aware of what's in my food and what I eat! One thing that I have boycotted is fast food! Not only because of how the food is processed but because of what the fast food industry stands for! It's horrible!! This is just my own opinion watch the movie yourself and make an opinion for yourself!! If anything you'll be more knowledgeable of what is being put into the food you eat!!
B0021L8UPS|4.0|Looking for something a little different?  While the overall storyline is nothing new what sets this movie apart is Vera Farmiga's role as a concerned mother.  Just like a momma bear, Farmiga's character will go to any distance to keep her children safe from the sadistic, psycho, little &#*&# named Esther.  The main plot twist near the end was great.  This movie does take a while to get warmed up but once it does it is roller coaster ride.  Movies are about being entertained and that's just what this surprisingly good movie did....kept me entertained as I tried to piece together just what made poor little Esther tick!!!
B001XJEKGC|5.0|My review of Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood's DVD of their concert at Madison Square is simple and short, I love the package. The sound is just right, no frills, the mix was honest to goodness, as if I was there watching the show itself. The camera work showcasing both stars is spot on. The music is quite stellar, too - great supporting by the bass player, drummer and keyboard player. I love this DVD as it is about the artists and their talent and songs, not some showbusiness type mockery of the music.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|Beauty is in the eye of the beholder....so they say!  I guess this applies to movies as well.  While many may claim this is a great movie I digress otherwise.  It's slow paced, poorly acted, and comes across as being somewhat pretentious.  The only part of this movie that I did enjoy was the part played by Diane Kruger (Troy)and the twist of her character's appearance.  Other than that this movie is one that should be placed on life support.  Tarantino's only GOOD movie was \\"Pulp Fiction\\" which is a classic.  This stinker is no where close to being a good movie let alone a classic.
B001OQCV6K|1.0|This movie did absolutely nothing for me. Definitely wait to watch it on TNT next year when you can watch it for free.
B00005MP58|4.0|This is easily the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  Well worth your time.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Ive read this book mare than 30 times. theres another series after this coming out on october 10th.
B00127RAJY|4.0|It's a good workout.  The three segments are very challenging - even for someone who works out on a regular basis.  But don't purchase based upon the \\"up to 20lb\\" weight loss claim.  I am in better shape after 30 days but haven't  lost any noticible amount of weight.
B000063V8R|5.0|The 3rd season of the Next Generation Star Trek series marked the beginning of the best of the episodes the series ever had. It also introduced the Borg, brought back Gates McFadden, and continued the growth of the strong inter-personal relationships between the crew. Definately a good season, all the way through.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I will make my review short, sweet, and to the point. This is the best movie that has ever been made. Everyone should watch this movie. Anyone who says they don't like this movie doesn't know what a good movie is.
B000HTMQW4|5.0|The book was as described.  The dust jacket was worn and had holes along the spine, but the book itself was in good condition.  It was pricey at 60.00 but the book was the 14th reprint of the originaL book.  It was shipped right away, so I had it in just days after ordering
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I was kind of surprised that I would be entertained by this film. I am not into Sherlock Holmes at all but I found Robert Downey Jr's performance to be highly entertaining and should have been an easy Oscar nomination but that didn't happen so maybe next time. Jude Law was fantastic as Dr. John Watson, a doctor who is going to get married to Mary but Holmes has this unusual dependence upon him. It's a platonic relationship and the movie doesn't dwell on that too much. It has a great supporting cast like James Fox OBE and Geraldine James OBE and Rachel McAdams as the love interest. There are some funny moments especially when naked Holmes is cuffed and bound and caught in bed by a startled maid. There is also adventure and it's a fun film. I think Guy Ritchie deserves credit in directing this film. Downey and Law were on their marks and Holmes and Watson.    The only part was the script's weakness and the plot. Anyway, I'm sure that you'll find it entertaining. The costumes and art direction are first rate. Unfortunately, Downey nor Law didn't get nominated for that Oscar. Maybe they should have Sherlock Holmes investigate the matter.
B0000029LG|4.0|After Michael Passed I went and got all of his mainstream cds but could not find this one. I finally looked online and found it here. Songs like Scream, You are not Alone and Earth Song are up there with his best and greatest hits. 2 personal favorites of mine are Childhood and Stranger in Moscow. I also enjoyed They dont care about us. After that the songs get a little bit, I want to say boring or uninteresting. This time around and Tabloid Junkie are tolerable, After listening to DS, money and 2 bad I thought the lyrics were ok but the music was lacking somehow. There are a couple of real MJ Gems to be found though.
0920668364|5.0|This book was read at my high school graduation banquet by a mother to her son, one of my friends. It brought the room to tears. I still can't read it to my son without crying and laughing. It is not a literal book that as a mom you will climb into your adult son's bedroom and rock him to sleep. It is a metaphor of how you will always be in your child's heart and the child in your heart. Those who think this is creepy are being too literal and not giving children and children's books credit for the depth they are written at. This is a beautiful simple story about love and family.
1401923119|1.0|Save your money!  I bought this through Kindle so I didn't even pay full price for it, thankfully!  The first 5 chapters of this 7 chapter book was mostly scientific biology which didn't interest me at all and was able to skip most of it without missing much.  I thought I was getting to the heart of the book and was finally going to get some answers to find out that there aren't any answers...anywhere.  I was looking for something that would guide me into changing my way of thinking, things to practice.  No luck - not here.  In the Addendum he references PSYCH-K with Rob Williams which was basically a plug for you to attend one of their seminars.  UG!!  A waste of money and time!  I'd give this book zero stars if I could.
096798467X|5.0|I have looked for a good source book on making an outdoor bread/pizza oven.  This book is just the ticket. Since I picked it up, everyone I have talked to has told me over and over again that I made a good purchase. The writing is clear and the images help to convey the image.  I recommend it highly!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Not much to add other than what's been written by the other 260+ reviewers.  I'd just say if you have any interest in this show, buy this, it's a total hoot to watch.  This series started strong, and has kept going strong since.  Buy it!
B0035G1K7S|5.0|This is one of the most powerful yet nuanced live performances I can remember! Most live recordings lose the subtle flavors heard on studio recordings, but the Stripes deliver a complete sonic palette. And if you don't think Jack White is one of the legendary guitarists, just watch this (especially Icky Thump in Yellowknife) before making up your mind.     Plus, Meg looks especially fetching with her skinny legs, tight butt, impressive rack and shy demeanor!
B000008JUM|3.0|What Lisa Stanfield does with \\"Down in the Depths\\" will absolutely raise the hairs on the back of your neck, and k.d. lang's delivery of \\"So In Love\\" is heart wrenching.    If you buy this album for just one or two tracks: own it to listen to what these masters of vocal artistry can do with a song.    (Some of the interpretations by other artists were immediately forgettable when the album was released and have definitely become dated.)
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Resemblance?    A man is unhappy and looking for direction. Through fate, he's given an opportunity to go into the unknown. The West, Pandora. He's given a mission. Once there, he encounters the wonder of it all. The sky, the wildlife, the isolation from an uncaring world. He tries to communciate with those, who know this land. He becomes closer to a mysterious woman, who teaches him about her world. Romance blooms, as he soon begins to lose himself. His mission becomes less important.    She teaches him how to talk. They laugh and smile, and fall in love. The land around him grows and grows. He learns about her world. Her people's history, battles, and way of life. He eats their food, devours their poetry, and becomes one of them.    He consumates their union. His connection to her grows. His past reaches back. The world he served... wants control over everything. He watches, as something he loves dies. The loss effects him greatly.     Dubbed a traitor and captured, he no longer has anything in common with his former world. He escapes.     Killing many who were once his kin, he beomes a symbol for his people. Given his own name. Reunited with his beloved, he lives on. Turning his back, on his former life.    Is this Avatar or Dances with Wolves?     Both films are solidly made, but one can't help but notice. Similarity.    Both films are well over three hours. And had huge box office success. Which tells me, it works. No matter how many times it's tried.    Avatar is a benchmark of blockbuster storytelling. Its success shows the formula works.     Had Avatar been live-action (fully, not partial), it would have won the Oscar.
B00005JNX0|5.0|I didn't think these films would be any good so I didn't see them.  My brother told me they were really good.  I watched and agree.  They're both REALLY funny.  Thanks bro.
B000VWLEP2|5.0|This is one of Clapton's best albums, in spite of the drug problems he had up to then. First heard this when I'd moved to California and it was a main attraction to many of the events & assorted parties out there.    MP3 files are not my primary choice when it comes to good music. The compression tends to lose some of the detail and I'd rather have the CD, vinyl, or a wav file for the higher resolution. But the price and the convenience of immediate ownership, plus the better-than-average survival of the quality all make this a download worth the purchase.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Although she has a beautiful voice, I never thought I would buy a Susan Boyle album, but I heard her sing a bit of \\"Wild Horses\\", originally done by the Rolling Stones and I was hooked.  She put a wonderful spin on this song and her beautiful voice delivered the rest of the album, making you want to listen as often as possible.  The album has a lovely selection of songs, do yourself a favor and go for it, you won't be disappointed.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|2 disc set of all the hits...superb song writing poetry. I'm going to order a bunch for holiday presents...you can't get better than Cohen!
1594481717|3.0|First, let me make it clear that Pink's targeted audience is an uneducated majority or a group looking for a quick read. He paints his argument in a black-and-white fashion, ignoring complexities, probably angering more sophisticated readers. In addition, he seems to be writing to a \\"right-brained\\" audience to reinforce thinking rather than to create converts. Reason is, his arguments are not supported with factual data, but rather with anecdotes. Although they read well, \\"left-brainers\\" will be disappointed if looking for any type of intellectual thesis. Also, if you're shopping at Barnes & Noble, it will be found in \\"self-help,\\" a section that is less hard science and more motivational. Reading Pink's book in this context will make it more enjoyable, because all in all, it's not a terrible book.    It does make several big blunders.   1) It underestimates the capabilities of our Asian counterparts, reducing them to machines basically, while overestimating our own potential.   2) It encourages individuals to go into design fields, which economically, there is no demand for. Not to say it's not important, it's definitely a value-added function, but either the demand is being met or companies will have to find a way to make it a larger competitive advantage that can translate into $$. Apple has done it, but other companies have not.    On the other hand, it does have good overarching messages (when you read through the crap).  1) Society should focus on value-added activities because yes, a lot of jobs are replaceable through technological means.  2) American liberal arts education provides a very different perspective and way of thinking which can be an asset.  3) Parents (if reading) should encourage creative arts in conjunction with the hard sciences and maths because everyone learns differently, and having a balanced education provides better synthesis.    It's not a bad book... just remember to read it in context of the author's audience. I seriously doubt thatPink is actually as extreme as his book presents him to be.
B001UV4XX8|3.0|Mr. Richard Kelly has written and directed what may become a cult classic. I have seldom seen such divergent opinions of this film, but I don't think anyone can claim that it is boring. The cinematic images alone are stunning, and I think that the F/X was up for awards of some kind.   \\"The Box\\" has either angered, baffled, delighted, or caused its viewers to scratch their heads. The best version to purchase is the \\"Blu-Ray\\" edition. First, watch the film, then see it again, listening to Mr. Kelly's commentary. The film is extremely complicated, and draws some of its story from science fiction, and some of the personal story of Arthur and Norma Lewis from Mr. Kelly's own parents: his father was a NASA engineer, and his mother was a high school English teacher. His mother DID have an accident and injury to her foot when she was younger, and his father DID make a prosthetic device for her, enabling her to walk better and without discomfort. His mother is from Texas. Many people criticized Cameron Diaz for her Virginia accent. I think Ms. Diaz was trying for a TEXAS accent. As a native New Yorker, I have no idea how successful Ms. Diaz was.  I also think that it must have been an honor for Ms. Diaz and Mr. Marsden to have been selected to portray versions of Mr. Kelly's own parents. Marsden looks nothing like Kelly's father; there must have been something else in Marsden's onscreen persona or acting ability and/or personality to have been selected for the role. Diaz, similarly, looks nothing like the senior Mrs. Kelly.  Besides science fiction (because of a Mars space landing, alien creatures want to test these upstart humans for their audacity in attempting space exploration--why don't they just stay on their own little planet and mind their business? and who are they anyway, and what are they capable of), another stream I see is a religious/theological one.  There are issues of damnation/salvation/atonement/sacrificial substitution/paying your debt for your sin.  Thoughts of Adam and Eve in the Garden come to mind. Temptation came and the challenge was too great. They knew better. Their sin (and I mean \\"their,\\" for Arthur, although he did not personally push the button, he was complicit) was a combination of greed and a quest for power. The power of life/death over someone else's life. There was poignancy over the fact that this couple were good, worthy, loving, and compassionate people. They were intelligent, and had great personal promise, despite their sin. This aspect of their personalities surprised Arlington Stewart, who may have been pessimistic about human possibilities.  I saw religious symbols: the most notable of which was water. Baptism. Noah and the Flood.   exodus and the Red Sea. Arthur was submerged in water, which saved him. Tragically, he was not able to save his wife; she had to pay the ultimate price for her sin, and sacrificed herself to save her son. Arthur's final fate was indeterminate: in the director's commentary, Kelly stated that Arthur would be \\"taken care of.\\"  I loved the acting. Kelly loved the acting. James Marsden is one of my favorite actors, and this is probably the most complicated role I have ever seen him play. His past success at comedy and singing and dancing are not featured in this role. Also, this is the first time I have seen Cameron Diaz in a serious performance. Her past comedy roles (\\"What Happens in Vegas,\\" \\"In Her Shoes,\\" etc., are not a factor in her performance.  I do not recommend this film to just anybody. In fact, I told my own sister not to see it; perhaps I am not giving her enough credit.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|After having viewed most of the UK version and the first two episodes of this documentary on Discovery, I agree  with the negative reviews this is getting. To summarize, here's the pros and cons of the US version:    Cons:  - The script was re-written for the US. The narration sounds like it's directed toward an 8 year old instead of a    general audience. At times it feels like you're being talked down to.  - You can tell Oprah is reading instead of narrating; she sounds like she's telling a bed time story.  - Oprah mispronounces several times fairly common words and sometimes drops her voice tone too quickly at the end    of her sentences. Can get a bit annoying.  - The editing is all over the place. It does not flow as well as the original as some segments are shown before    others so continuity is broken.  - The commercial breaks are placed in really bad spots during the broadcast. Kills the excitement for the next    segment.    Pros:  - It's finally available for viewing in the US for all those waiting for this series. (The mute button works    wonders)  - Makes you appreciate even more the great job Sir David Attenborough did narrating this excellent series in the    UK broadcast of this show.      By the way, you may see the UK version already available for purchase on Amazon.uk. Please do not commit the same  mistake I did and purchase that version for a US PS3 blu-ray player. Although the discs are region-free, the  content is encoded with a mixture of 50Hz and 60Hz signals. So although the US PS3 can view 60Hz content fine,  it just shows a black screen on the 50Hz content. Unfortunately the main menu and the credits at the end of each  chapter are encoded in 50Hz so the PS3 would just go to a black screen and stay there (it can't skip it). Hence I  could not get past the main menu. Other US blu-ray players are able to play/bypass 50Hz signals, but the US PS3  cannot. So now I patiently wait for the US version of the UK broadcast...
B001AVCFK6|5.0|this movie is a box office GREAT, hands down! really an enjoyable movie to watch for any age group. it has comedy, emotion, suspense, action i mean...what more could you ask for in a movie ( =D) 5 Stars!!
B001SO6KNS|5.0|This movie was much more than I expected. If you think this is just a martial arts movie you would be wrong. I consider it the best martial arts movie I have ever seen and one of the best overall movie I have ever watched. A new favorite for me. My wife usually doesn't care for martial arts movie and she loved this one. A classic.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|This movie is on par with ALL the other bonds movies from my generation. never saw the older ones with sean connery, but i think daniel craig does a great job as 007. its currently one of my favorites from the bond movies i've seen to date. 5 Stars for Casino Royale!
B002MW50KO|5.0|This is a great cd. I almost wore it out during the holiday. Great job Dylan!
B001F7MSG6|5.0|i really enjoy the hellboy movies. if you are a fan of hellboy then you should love his movie too! 5 Stars!
0321544080|3.0|There are some good tips about lighting, lenses, flashes, filters, working with models.  I wish it was more technical, but you can't expect a magician to give away all his secrets...Even in his own book.
B001E75QGG|5.0|i've always been a fan of the indy movies. this one just reels me in more, period! 5 Stars
0439023483|5.0|I didn't think that I would like this book. I didn't like the premise. I don't generally like post-apocalyptic books, and a book about a reality TV show in which teens fight to the death didn't appeal to me. I thought it would be disturbing and depressing, but I heard a lot of positive things about it and eventually read it. I loved it! I didn't find it overly disturbing, though it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It ended really hopefully.
B001GCUO16|5.0|i really enjoyed this movie, saw it in the theater and now am a proud owner of the blu-ray! great cast and hope there is more to come! 5 STARS!
0385737947|3.0|It was exciting and interesting. It kept me pretty riveted, but the violence and death in this book, especially toward the end seem overdone, gratuitous. The ending was disturbing and unsatisfying.
B000Q7ZND6|4.0|this is a decent movie to get a good fright to lol just as good as when i saw it in theaters. i have the dvd and blu-ray now, time to ditch the dvd lol 4 Stars!
0439023491|4.0|It was good, but there is a lot of summing up of things, not just the previous book--a lot of telling rather than showing. Also there was a period toward the end when I was pretty confused. It eventually all got cleared up, but the book just didn't seem quite as well done as the first one. Still, it's definitely worth reading.
B001HN694K|1.0|\\"How yet this dark and lonely night  About us tempts and teases;  How, too, this ever-waning light  So thoroughly displeases...\\"    So proclaims the Queen of Hearts in her final soliloquy to the doomed Knave of Hearts in J.T. Holden's masterful retelling of the Lewis Carroll classic, appropriately entitled [[ASIN:0982508999 Alice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland]]. These mournful words could just as easily be attributed to the bewildered moviegoer who has shelled out good money for Tim Burton's spectacle-without-substance sequel to that same Carroll classic. As the credits roll and the truth settles in, it is the advice of the wily Cheshire Cat in Holden's book that haunts with its greater truth:      \\"If you really must go, then it's best you should know  That to find you need only to seek--  But in seeking and finding, you may need reminding,  Once found, is what's sought worth a peek?\\"
1584282584|4.0|As someone who knew very little about flash photography this book (On-Camera Flash Techiques for Digital Wedding and Portrait Photography) has been a tremendous help.  It is not overwhelming filled with jargon and there are heaps of examples to prove points in the text.  I have found it to be extremely helpful for a not-quite-novice photographer.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|When I first saw the trailer for this, I was intrigued with the entire concept of the film. Gerald Butler plays a engineer who goes more than a little mad after his family is killed and the killer gets off scotfree via plea bargain by turning in and blaming it all on his accomplice. Flash forward to ten years later and Gerald's character unleashes a revenge scheme so grandiose and detailed you can't help but be impressed with his determination. Jamie Foxx plays the DA who allowed the plea bargain to go through and who now has to watch Butler destroy everyone involved in the original murder trial before he goes after the American \\"justice\\" system itself.    This is a great concept but there are a few problems. All of the protagonists in the film are utterly unlikeable. They are shallow short sighted and well, they're pretty much self-obsessed jerks without any redeeming qualities. Butler's character, as insane as he is, is the most likeable person in the film and you find yourself rooting for him if only because a) everyone he is targeting does deserve it and b) everyone he is targeting come off worse than this serial murderer.    My other issue is the ending. I'm not going to spoil it, but there are some huge plot holes and things that could happen based on time, location and prior characterization throughout the movie. It really kills the suspension of disbelief and you end up being disappointed with the overall package because of how sloppy the ending is.     At the end of the day, this is certainly worth watch, but I can't say it's worth owning.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book was extremely touching...I was hanging on every word attempting to guess the end result of this story...heartbreaking and fantastically written, this hearwrenching story is a must read for anyone and everyone.
B002TYZKIM|3.0|There's really only one song worth buying this cd for, otherwise just get his albums which are much better. I guess this is for people new to Michael, but I'm sure all his diehard fans that have everything he's ever made are buying this one as well when they don't really need it.
0123694965|5.0|I'll be honest, I haven't gotten too far into the book. Every time I pick up the book, I read something interesting and start working on an idea I have. You've heard of one liners? This is jam packed with them. Get your highlighter ready, it doesn't matter if you're in game design, UI Design or ad design, I think you'll find something interesting.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Really, why not Marta Stewart or Tiger Woods? There is so many famous and wonderful folks in America, why this morons choosed oprah? To sell more? Sorry I'm russian and I'm not in oprah fanclub, I cannot care less about her remarkable achievement in entertainment biz.  Just people please keep those mcdonalds guys away from nature, documentary or anything with planet earth in it. By the way Sigourney Weaver was cool in Avatar and Aliens, but this is our planet.  David Attenborough is the guy. Many people said that to listen to oprah like to listen bedtime story, sorry but I still would rather listen bedtime stories narrated by David Attenborough.
1423119509|4.0|This is a very well done book set.  Even if you didn't like the movie, the books are wonderful.  They are also very simple to read, so your kids may love it too.  It only took me a couple of days to read the whole series, but I enjoyed it very much.  This set has hard cover books in it, but the outer box is made of card board and by design tends to tear at the corners of the cover.  I ended up throwing it away after a short while because it got to the point where it looked really shabby and tattered.  This is the reason for the loss of one star.  It would have been nice to see a better quality case.  Overall, the story is excellent and this set is a good deal even with a cheaper case.
B00003CX8N|5.0|This film is a real gem!  Unlike most films, this one sticks very closely to the facts and ambiance of the book (with the same name) on which it is based, and the actors and actresses for all roles were very well-chosen. It is a romance about people, and about old books and second-hand book-shops.  It will make you love the feel and smell of well-bound old books, as well as their contents.  It will make you appreciate margin notes,the names of previous owners and the significance of books falling open at pages that have been loved and much looked at.  It is a film about warm, kind and thoughtful people that will leave you feeling inspired, uplifted and happy. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
0896898288|1.0|I purchased this book thinking I had a great set of stories and quilt blocks from the past. Over the last few months as I have been attempting to make the blocks from the \\"templates\\" included in the book, I am ready to toss the whole thing in the trash. I have been quilting for 38 years, I cannot imagine just starting out and trying to put this together.    The templates are all placed on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper, when the template is 1 inch by 1 inch. You must print out the template in order to make the block, but when you do use the template, it doesn't matter. Because the blocks are different sizes, IF they even go together.    I will not purchase another book by this author, nor this publisher, no facts were checked when creating the templates and obviously no blocks were made, which makes me doubt the \\"facts\\" as presented otherwise, also.    The editor should have hired someone to at least check the measurements.    This book was a waste of money. It was a great concept with lack of follow-through.

B001HN694K|1.0|I have always love &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; and newer nonsense like &#34;Monty Python's Flying Circus&#34; & &#34;Brazil&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; is a wonderful book, influential in my formative years, I saw the Disney version and read the book, first in college. Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a Mathematician and Logic Professor at Oxford. The girl on whom &#34;Alice&#34; was based was an inquisitive, sweet young child, Alice Liddell. The greatest thing about this book was it is nonsense. Carroll plays clever but logically consistent nonsense word games throughout. It prepared me for a world which should be logical and rational but seldom is and is often laughable nonsense. Think of an America president going to war, searching everywhere for nonexistent weapons of mass destruction while ignoring the real threats to America. Nonsense and silly logic abound.<br /><br />Tim Burton destroys the basic nonsense premise of the book wherein Alice is the only one asking logical questions and the other characters respond with silly nonsense. This movie starts with Alice, a willful teen whose major act of defiance is refusing to wear a corset. (When John Tenniel did etchings for the early Alice editions, he sometimes substituted a girl that looked more like the teen in this movie.) Burton has supplied us with rational explanations at every turn. Tweeledum and Tweeledee are the wonderland equivalent of annoying teen girls above. Everyone in Wonderland has an analogue in the real world. Alice is being pushed into an unwanted marriage with the Upperclass Twit of the Year, no chin and bright red hair. So she escapes from this pressure down the rabbit hole into Wonderland.<br /><br />In Wonderland, all of the characters, and I do mean all, are dumbed-down into Friends of Alice (FOA) and Enemies of Alice (EOA). Alice in Wonderland is turned into the equivalent of a car chase movie. Instead of the nonsense all of the characters of the book, there is a plot - the evil oppressor Queen of Hearts (Helena Bonham Carter) and her henchmen want to kill Alice (EOA) and the March Hare, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, Smoking Caterpillar and Cheshire Cat (FOA) want to help Alice into being a lib Wonderland superhero. This dumbing-down doubtless makes the movie clearer for Little Johnny and Little Suzie, so they can understand these black and white/good guys and bad guys, but it destroys the essence of Carroll's original. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter has a bit of the clever Carroll word play (but even his part is over-explained and rationalized). He and lead Helena Bonham Carter have the only real acting parts in this movie. She puts her feet up on a pig to rest them! I'm surprised the Walrus and the Carpenter didn't' choose sides. One of my favorite nonsense poems, the Jabberwocky, is similarly forced to choose sides with Alice the hero in armor! I searched in vain for an interesting character and the only one was the &#34;evaporating&#34; toothy Cheshire Cat.<br /><br />Why do movie producers insist on overlaying contemporary values on historical fiction?  The rationalized end of this movie is a cloyingly formulaic, Victorian feminist, coming-of-age wish-fulfillment. The end of the movie (which I won't reveal) is so bad, so lib, it made me want to gag.<br /><br /> Is this the future of movies, dumbed down 3D predisgested pablum? Why waste all this acting and animation talent on a ludicrously bad screenplay?<br /><br />Hey, just trying to save your money!<br /><br />If you want to see a much better feminist coming-of-age movie, try &#34;An Education&#34; or &#34;Young Victoria&#34;; a better cartoon-ish movie with a much better plot and more believable fleshed out characters &#34;The Princess and the Frog&#34;; or a better &#34;Alice in Wonderland, try Disney (or any other version ever made).n of Hearts (Helena Bonham Carter) and her henchmen want to kill Alice (EOA) and the March Hare, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, Smoking Caterpillar and Cheshire Cat (FOA) want to help Alice into being a lib Wonderland superhero.

B001FB4VZS|5.0|I am a recent Smallville convert, having watched all of the first 8 seasons over the last couple of months. I love the new darker turn of this season; thank heavens for finally getting rid of Lana (of whom I was previously a fan until her character played itself out and yet the writers kept her in, no matter the ridiculousness of the plot - seriously, marrying Lex? superpowers?). I am missing Lex Luthor (and the fantastic Michael Rosenbaum) however, as we didn't really get to see the final turn in the Superman/Lex story. I only hope that the writers plan to bring Lex back down the road once Clark completes his turn into the superhero. Of course, this wish is pinned on my desperate hopes that they bring Smallville back for a 10th season now that it has finally become less teen-soap-like. I really like the replacement character of Tess though since she can't really be pinned down. I love the relationship between Clark and Lois, especially since we all know how inevitable it is. It felt a little patchy, however, when Clark was supposedly so in love with the returned super-powered Lana, who leaves Clark devastated and in the next episode he is completely over her and back on track with his infatuation with Lois. This can most likely be attributed to the writers realizing that Clark had really long since fallen out of love with Lana and her farewell episode was idiotic and there was no need to dwell on the writers mistake. Love Oliver's character (played by the great Justin Hartley) and the always reliably wonderful Allison Mack as Chloe. It's nice to see them as more than just background characters for Clark to bounce off of. My only complaint is this: let Clark fly already!!
0634022296|2.0|I've been working with this book. The chords don't always sound right.     Also, the chord tabs often seem to choose a difficult fingering for a chord that has a much easier fingering.     I find that when I can get chords on the Internet, they often sound better and are easier to play. Are these chords coming direct from the Fab Four, or did someone make these up from listening?
0312370849|4.0|Amazon.com delivered the book \\"Sarah's Key\\" in excellent condition and the book is terrific!  The price for this new book was at least 45% lower than the price in a bookstore.  It is certainly worth the wait to have it shipped from Amazon.  Shipping was minimal and as I said the price of the book was substantially lower than buying it retail.  This book was selected by our book club here in CT and all of us loved it.  I would definitely recommend buying books from Amazon and also would strongly recommend this book for its historial information as well as the compelling personal stories (two stories in the book) and very well written.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|Oh, come on now. No one watches a movie like this for erudite dialog or tour de force acting. We watch it to escape and have fun. And that I did!  My partner wouldn't watch it with me, so she spent the entire 2+ hours downloading (and printing!) a selection of bad reviews. She can't understand why I liked it, but it had it all -- action, special effects, romance, special effects, humor, special effects, and a hopeful ending (oh yes, did I mention SPECIAL EFFECTS???).<br /><br />I'm a 60-year old woman who loves gentle, leisurely paced foreign language films and what has been dubbed \\"Spiritual\\" movies. I cannot stand blood and gore or realistic violence of any kind. But I had a ball with this film!
B002IVLH60|3.0|I bought this CD for the sole reason that it was the only way I could get the song - Just Breathe by Pearl Jam - Eddie Vedder, because it is not available any where else. If it wasn't for that I would not have bought it. It was also because I was DJing a Wedding and the Bride wanted this song included in the Pre-Wedding / Diner Music playlist. If the song had been available as an MP3 download I would have purcased it that way vs buying the entire CD which is not near as cost effective.

B002ODEJYE|5.0|I never review products on Amazon. However, this DVD is amazing. P!nk's is an incredible singer, song writer, and performer. I watched this performance on TV and had to have the DVD. In addition to listening and watching, I use her music as motivation for exercise.<br /><br />Her singing, acrobatics, and energy is so invigorating. Oh yeah, and she's funny too.<br /><br />Thank you P!nk for this beyond incredible performance.<br /><br />Ken Leebow<br />[...].

0545123267|5.0|Ever since she was attacked by wolves when she was eleven, Grace Brisbane has watched them every winter in the woods. There's one yellow-eyed wolf in particular, the one who saved her, that she can't stop herself from looking for.<br /><br />I read this book with a boring week of no writing or reading and just pure boredom when it came to it. I was excited when it came in the mail, though, my fingers itching to read it. When I started off, I was confused and curious at the same time.<br />Maggie Stiefvater writes beautifully. You don't want to miss a page or paragraph, or sentence. I felt myself reading this book in no time with excitement and ease. The romance in this book is at a good level in my opinion. There is always the angst in books nowadays that doesn't hold the regular, gooey, fluffiness that some readers like. There's either too much gooey, fluffiness or too much angst. Shiver is a good example for a book that is beautifully written and balances angst and romance at a level I wish was in more books.
B0000640VO|4.0|I received it in excellent conditon and in a timely manner! The quality and humor are great for a foreign film......Great gift!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I love board games and strategy games. Risk used to be my favorite until I discovered Settlers. You create the board each games, so the board looks different every single game. No one strategy can be used every game. Endless board arrangements are available. The game is best suited for 3-4 players, but can be played with up to 6 with the 5-6 player expansion. The game is kind of a hybrid between Monopoly and Risk, but can be played in 60-90 minutes. It can be even quicker with more experienced players. You will not regret buying this game!
B000000HHE|5.0|I believe it came all the way from Europe! It was in excellent condition and I received it in a timely manner! The quality of sound and music was superb! I didn't think I could ever find it again--surprise!!!! It is an excellent gift for any music lover of my generation!!!!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|You can't beat having all the Greatest Hits from the Great One in one collection. The DVD has some of the same videos as History and other concert dvd's, but worth it. Especialy \\"They Don't Care About Us\\". The booklet included is an awesome read. I love the white finish of the case. I uploaded all the songs to my iPod, but worth the keepsake!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I grew up watching The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and the like, and while I absolutely adore all of the stuff that comes out of the Pixar studio, I was missing some of the classic Disney. I have to admit that before I watched the Princess and the Frog, I was a bit concerned. A lot of fuss had been made over the fact that the princess was African American, and while I have no problem with princesses of any color, I hoped that they didn't focus more on the ethnicity than on the story.<br /><br />Thankfully someone at Disney got their head screwed on straight and the story is superb. Not only is it fun to watch, but there are a number of life lessons that you can learn from the movie. While I enjoyed the entire movie (and yes, I cried) I really liked a few specific things, including the fact that the \\"spoiled little white girl\\" in the movie wasn't a bad person. She, in the end, while definitely being spoiled, had a very sweet personality. I loved the music (can't go wrong with Randy Newman) and the fact that they selected actors who weren't hugely famous (save Oprah and Emeril, of course) so that the voices didn't immediately bring that person to mind. Instead you were able to connect the voice to the character, which always makes an animated film better.<br /><br />This movie has already been watched five times in our house since we purchased it - and I'm not ashamed to admit that twice I watched it for my own private viewing while the kids were at school. Well done Disney! You definitely were able to go back to your roots while, at the same time, bringing some great lessons.

B0030BOCEG|5.0|I have been a huge HIM fan for a long time. I DO have a heartagram tattoo and I pretty much worship the ground these guys walk on. I've read a lot of reviews and the first thing I notice is that there are a lot of people who genuinely dont like this album because it has a different sound. And that's understandable considering this is a far fetch from Razorblade Romance or Deep Shadows. But you cant say you didnt see this coming. Every HIM album has been different in some way. Razorblade was really edgy and rocky. Deep Shadows mellowed out and it changed with each album. I have not been disappointed with any of their albums. They all brought something different to the table. Now that thats out of the way, let's talk Screamworks. It is a mix of Venus Doom and Razorblade. Its got the gloomy songs of VD and the rocky vibe of RR. I can easily say that I can listen to this album all the way through without skipping a song. My personal favorites are Ode to Solitude, Disarm Me, and Like St. Valentine.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|I think I love the songs in \\"Love Never Dies\\". They are beautiful in their own way.  It's not fair if we are going to compare \\"Love Never Dies\\" with \\"The Phantom of The Opera\\". That was best of the best.  But \\"Love Never Dies\\" is also great if you seperate it from \\"The Phantom of The Opera\\". The storyline is about 10 years pass, life move on, even the Phantom.  He have changed.  From the bitter genius who was denied by the society, now he is a great and powerful American citizen (I guess).  And by the way, the location is Coney Island, not a sophisticate French society.  Also it is the island that the \\"FREAK\\" can walk among men. Have you ever go to the freak show or circus, the environment must be fun, lively, colorful not the bitter, grumpy and dark relam underneath the opera house.<br /><br />So, forget about \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"Love Never Dies\\" is different. Why else the place called \\"Phantasma\\"?. I think ALW should be praise for delivery the show this great.  Especially Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess and the rest of the casts and crews, it is fantastic job that they are doing.  For example \\"Look with You Heart\\", this song bring tear to my eyes (a lot) it is a song that mother try to comfort her dearest son that his father (Raoul) also love him even he is angry all the time.  And when it is reprised at the end of the show, it's telling the audiences to \\"Look With Your Heart\\".  It has a very complex meaning in so very simple words. Just only need us to listen carefully.<br /><br />And UMMMM WOW!!! \\"Beneath A Moonless Sky\\" - WOW!!!! That's HOT! HOT! HOT!. The song is so sexual, confession, passionate and ... so much more ... you can only imagine. The love flame grew hotter and brighter in every note that The Phantom and Christhine have been duet. WOW! WOW! WOW!<br /><br />That's all for my review and please \\"Look with your heart and not with your eyes. The heart can't be fool, the heart is too wise. Forget what you think, ignore what you hear. Look with your heart, it always see clear\\"ee clear\\"
0316044695|4.0|Highly recommended. The first half of the book follows the author's training as a Navy SEAL, from enlistment to \\"graduation.\\" This in itself is a fascinating read; the author states that the SEALs are the most rigorously trained special forces group in the world, and after reading about what they must endure, I would not argue. These guys are tough. I knew that SEAL training was demanding, but I had no idea just how few individuals can stand up to it. Even the biggest, strongest men drop like flies. I'll never forget the phrase \\"get wet and sandy.\\"    The second half of the book relates in detail the disaster that befell the author's SEAL team in Afghanistan. It is an incredible story, reading like a fantastic Hollywood action movie, yet all true. Everything is there; remarkable bravery, courage against overwhelming odds, tragedy and triumph, brotherhood and sacrifice, and ultimately an affirmation that there are some good people even among the \\"bad guys.\\" A remarkable story in every regard.    There is also a message to those in the U.S. who don't understand or appreciate what our armed forces must endure; and the battles they must fight both with a fanatical enemy as well as with \\"friendly\\" elements back home.    Very well written and a must-read. It won't take you long to read this exceptional book, because once you start, you will not be able to avoid turning the page.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|It's not good enough that you spent you money to get the movie the legal way. They want you to spend now AND spend later. There is a Avatar special edition already confirmed for November 2010, just in time to cash in for Christmas. It will have additional footage, deleted scenes and other bonus features.<br /><br />I guess it was too easy to give the consumer the additional movie features the studio and director already have from the get go! That's called greed.<br /><br />Those of you who keep complaining about there being no 3D don't seem to realize that you need a 3D TV 1st to do it the best way. 99% of homes still have 2D so why would they release a higher priced movie for the sake of 3D TVs that only 1000 people in the whole world have?  2nd, do you have $4000 for a 3D TV set after you just bought a HDTV? Doing 3D on a regular TV is NOT the same quality as in the theater. It won't look nearly as good.  I think they want to wait and do it right, when more of the sets are in people's homes.<br /><br />I'm sure there movie studio will have 2 or 3 other versions, including 3D, to get more of your money.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|Really do NOT like Oprah's voice as a narrator.  While watching the televised version she says \\"octopuses\\" instead of octopi (yes, I know there is debate on -pi versus -puses) but it sounded bad.  Next, she pronounced \\"ecosystem\\" as \\"echo\\" system - again, it hit the ear as just really WRONG.  Would take Signorney Weaver over Oprah any time.  Signorney did a much better narration for Planet Earth.  Oprah's voice lacks depth and character, and often she drops her voice so you can't hear what she's saying.  She's not clear and crisp.      BTW - My 18 year old's first reaction was negative upon hearing Oprah's voice, and she was quick to point out the Octopi and Ecosystem pronunciation errors.  Don't waste your money on any version with Oprah narrating.

1400052173|5.0|The story of Henrietta Lacks embodies the racial, cultural, educational, and medical disparity that was and is the American Experience for far too many.  This wonderfully narrated and exceptionally documented drama flows back and forth over the lives of ordinary people, doctors, scientists, journalists and others who by intention, chance, struggle or degrees impact our lives in extraordinary ways.       Rebecca Skloot has produced a moving narrative that captivates, amazes and illuminates.  Through determination, passion and talent, Ms. Skloot has created a ripple (thunderous breaker) in the reality of her readers, and thereby, amplifies the immortal wave of Henrietta Lacks.  Thank you, ReSk.    The question is, how will this true life story move each of us to change and improve the American Experience and to become a better part of the immortality that carries others along with us?

B001OQCV2E|1.0|This film has perhaps one thing to recommend it and that's some of the visuals.  Apart from this aspect, it really is a complete waste of time and money and I deeply regret purchasing it.    The story is representative of what appears to be the very worst of Hollywood which appeals to the same sort of base instincts that make people want to stop and look at accidents - it has no intellectual content whatsoever, the story is vacuous, the parts are completely unbelievable and what might have been interesting, an exploration of the predictions by the Mayans and Nostradamus are left out completely.  Presumably deemed too challenging for the targeted audience.    Don't waste your money, honestly.
B0002XNRG4|4.0|The Canon 17-85 lens is now my favorite walk-around lens. It has the flexibility for all the field requirements that I need when out in the wilderness. I can take the overall wide angle shot and then get right in there for the close-up, detail shot. I was recently out shooting wildflowers in Anza-Borrego and this was the perfect lens. I never had to switch lenses for any shot. I wish I had this lens back in '05 for the great wildflower season! I almost fee the macro is unnecessary because I can get in extremely close and seatill keep the focus I need. For the price, you can't beat it.
9113020730|5.0|I couldn't wait for the US publication of the 3rd volume of Stieg Larsson's \\"Millenium Trilogy\\", so I ordered it from Amazon UK. It was worth the cost - exchange rate, shipping and all!<br /><br />Picking up right where \\"The Girl Who played With Fire\\" left off, we find crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist once again contending with a stultifying police bureaucracy while brilliant, enigmatic researcher/computer hacker Lisbeth Salander lies hospitalized with 3 bullet wounds, including one to the head.<br /><br />Larsson keeps his readers intrigued with the question of whether common sense and justice will prevail over the forces of bureaucracy, sinister secret police doings and old-boy-network track-covering, not to mention the sometimes lumbering, but still dangerous, criminal forces that are out to silence Salander and Blomkvist once and for all. Though confined to a hospital bed, and under police custody, Salander works her computer miracles in support of her own cause, and she and Blomkvist find allies who rally to their aid.<br /><br />I stayed up much later than was wise several nights in a row to finish this book -- I couldn't make myself put it down until I was so tired that I couldn't keep my eyes open! What a pity that Larsson passed away so young, with only these three books complete... (I have read that there is a fourth, incomplete, manuscript extant, but that his father has decided that it should not be published.)
1400032717|2.0|Though the writing is good the story is not one to choose lightly.<br />The book portrays dysfunctional family through the eyes of mentally challenged teen boy. To put it in a nutshell:<br />The mother is sick & tired of caring for her Autistic son, so she runs off with some guy to London, while the angry father proclaims to everyone that she died of Herat attack (to save his pride). The lonely father befriends their neighbor (mistaking pity for romance) who helps them out with the daily chores of cooking and cleaning. When the father spills the notion of marriage to the charitable woman she goes into a fit and slams the door in his face. Then he goes into a fit and kills her dog with a garden-pitchfork (??)<br />His son finds the dead dog and is arrested, which gives him the idea, to go and find the killer. Instead of finding the killer he finds hidden letters from his mom who isn't dead as he thought. After the father comes clean to him about Moms' \\"death\\" and the dog, the boy runs off to London, where his mothers' boyfriend goes into a fit when he sees him. The mother returns him to the father a day later. Everyone is surprised she isn't dead. The end.<br /><br />Half of the book is about solving mathematical problems (prime numbers, size of the universe') the other half is distressing (effects of Autism), depressing (father), and discussing (mom). WARNING: Definitely NOT creative, light, funny, great read, or re-read as the other reviews claim. You may find your self lost... (I give it **)

0393072231|5.0|Pretty standard Michael Lewis book. If you've read his previous books, you know the style. He finds people who actually predicted the unpredictable crash and follows them as they recount interactions with the people who did not see it coming.    It is interesting to see things from their perspective, and Lewis is a very engaging storyteller. If nothing else, the book serves as a great follow up to Liar's Poker. If you care about what happened, or how we got into the mess we are in, I suggest reading the book. I certainly plan on passing it around my friends and family.
0807014273|5.0|Man's Search For Meaning by Victor Frankl is one of the most profound, insightful books I've ever read.  Perhaps the perfect blend of circumstances-a trained psychologist subjected to the horrifying human laboratory of Nazi concentration camps, has produced a work of notable impact.  Part biography, part diary, part lab notes, Frankl analyzes his circumstances, his captors, fellow captives, and the human condition with clinical precision and gifted insight.  I found myself enthralled with the descriptive skill and hard-won conclusions the author shares such as: love is the highest aspiration of human kind, life requires meaning, that nobility cannot be taken from the truly noble among us.  Some editions also include an introduction to Frankl's psychological theories of Logotherapy, which I also enjoyed.  I fully recommend this book to everyone!

B002RSDW80|4.0|When my daughter called and said that she was coming over with the DVD-Julie and Julia for us all to watch, I immediately began a review of all the things that I \\"needed\\" to do today.  In other words, I had no interest in watching a film about Julia Child and some blogger named Julie.    Of course, I was hooked once the film began after numerous previews of films that I had heard of and had no interest.  The music and Paris in the late 1940's kept my attention.    Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci as Julia and Paul Child had instant chemistry which was interwoven by the exceptional writing of Nora Ephorn as well as her superb direction to bring life out of her written words.  Amy Adams and Chris Messina as Julie and Eric Powell, the young couple living in post 911 Queens, added a parallel story line which was adeptly integrated into this film.  The two parallel stories reflected the times very well.    I have to admit the costumes, sets, and especially the vintage automobiles for Julia and Paul Child's story were outstanding.  Their love for each other came to the surface in each scene. It reminded me of the old fashioned type romance movies which Hollywood did so well in the 30's, 40's and 50's.    It was good to see Mary Lynn Rajskub from 24 playing a normal friend for a change of pace.  She did a great job and was quite comical at times.    A follow up to this film is to read the two books on which Nora Ephorn based her beautifully crafted screenplay--Julie and Julia and My Life In France.      Now for the note about the Oscars: did Meryl Streep deserve an Oscar for her performance?  You bet she did!  At least the Golden Globe recognized her acting in this fine film.    Keep in mind this film is over two hours long, but I was so engrossed with the stories that I did not mind the length.  A well crafted film is worth the time investment.    Enjoy! Bon Appétit!
B003102JDM|5.0|Joel and Ethan Coen have time and time again managed to take us on the strangest and most fascinating journeys. With indelible characters that are alive, and possess the quirkiest of qualities, and worlds that are as odd and captivating, the brothers always manage to create something that has never been seen before, but is, at the same time, oh so familiar to us all. I don't think that anyone sees the world quite the same way that they do, and with A Serious Man, their collective vision has conjured up what may be the most personal film of their career. It is also one of the best.    The movie begins with a prologue of sorts, entirely spoken in Yiddish. A wife quarrels with her husband after he invites a dybbuk (Fyvush Finkel), a spirit from beyond the grave, into their house. This opening segment doesn't so much set up the main story as set the tone for the rest of the film. It is richly drawn out for suspense, and darkly comic, in traditional Coen brothers fashion. I at first thought the prologue may be an actual Yiddish folk tale, but I did some research, and as it turns out, it is entirely original. It is also delightfully off-putting in the finest possible way.     After this prologue, the main story begins in 1967. It revolves around Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor who is questioning his own purpose and existence as his life seems to be slipping out of grasp, to put it lightly. His wife, Judith (Sari Lennick), wants a divorce so that she can remarry their neighbor, Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), a widower whose wife's body is \\"barely cold\\", and who is also Larry's \\"best friend.\\" This is just the tip of the iceberg. Larry also deals with a disgruntled student whose bribe for a passing grade turns into blackmail, a woman sunbathing nude next door, and his brother Arthur (Richard Kind), who is staying on the couch, but is almost always in the bathroom, endlessly draining his cyst.     Larry attempts to understand why so many terrible things arehappening to him, and throughout the course of the film, receives no concrete answers. He sees two rabbis, and fails to see a third. His visit with the second unveils an utterly enigmatic story of a dentist who finds the words \\"Help me\\" in Yiddish on the tooth mould of an oblivious gentile customer.     Michael Stuhlbarg is terrific in this film, and he plays Larry as a very likeable guy. It's as if at every catastrophe, he is watching the storm in shock and awe, wondering how this could be happening to him. As things escalate, and become increasingly worse, instead of giving Larry a breaking point, Stuhlbarg levels off at his peak of disbelief and tries to allow the character to come to terms with the situation, and to deal with it. This, of course, is ultimately an impossible task seeing as how God, or Hashem, is as ruthless to Larry as he was to Job.     Fred Melamed made me cringe in every one of his scenes. Sy's pompousness and calm are so potent, and his interactions with Larry are not for the impatient. They are downright frustrating, and it is a joy to watch Larry burn under the surface of his disbelief. The Coens are masters of these kinds of awkward interactions, and their writing and direction in this is flawless, as is the cinematography by Coen brothers regular, Roger Deakins. It is the movie that Joel and Ethan Coen needed to make, and to follow the deeply flawed, but hysterical, Burn After Reading with such an existential masterpiece is what the world of cinema needed.     *On a side note, Carter Burwell's score is genius as usual, but Jefferson Airplane's \\"Somebody to Love\\" is the true anthem for this film. It has never sounded so perfect and crisp, nor has it ever fit into a film so exquisitely.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a great one day read to take along on a plane, to the beach or anytime you will have the opportunity to read.  Mitch is the everyman in this work, too wrapped up in life and not enough in truly living.  Morrie is the voice of wisdom and experience, who desperately wants to live his last days with as much love and meaning as possible.  Together again after many years apart, both find their coach/player, student/teacher relationship deeply meaningful and rewarding up until Morrie's passing and beyond.    We should all be as fortunate as Mitch to have a mentor in life, and wise enough to recognize it.  Filled with wisdom on many aspects of life, Morrie teaches Mitch, and us, that love and relationships are the highest aspiration of life.  I completely agree.

B00337KM2S|5.0|Based on the novel by Walter Kirn, Jason Reitman's latest hit Up in the Air revolves around Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who is hired to do what corporate bosses don't have the stomach to do: he fires people. As a corporate axe man, Ryan is constantly flying all over the country and is extremely systematic in his travels. He is very close to reaching that big number (10 million) in frequent flier miles, and this seems to be the solitary goal in his life. That is, until a wrench or two get thrown into the machine of Ryan's life.    He meets a fellow frequent flier named Alex (Vera Farmiga) in an airport lounge, and almost immediately begins the infatuation between them-or is it more than that? This is Ryan's question to himself, and with his way of doing business also put in jeopardy by a newcomer, Cornell graduate Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), he must also decide what he really wants in his life, and whether or not what he wants is best.     What makes Up in the Air work so well is the smart, edgy script, and the way the story never makes anything into a gimmick. There are many opportunities for broad jokes and gags to barge in, and in lesser hands, they very well might have. Luckily, Reitman handles the material with care, and delivers each scene with sharp precision. The comic and dramatic moments are brilliantly balanced, and there never seemed to be a moment of discomfort or awkwardness. It is a smooth plane ride without the turbulence of many dramatic comedies around these days.    This is the point I think: it is so rare to see such a well conceived and executed film such as this. It is so terrifically written and directed, polished and edited, and it delivers some excellent performances from Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick. There are also some delightful cameos from Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons, Danny McBride, and Sam Elliot, whose wisdom and presence grow the more his moustache does. His scene reminded me very much of the stranger's encounter with the Dudein The Big Lebowski.     I enjoyed Up in the Air much more than Juno in 2007. I found it to be sharper and more intelligent, and one of the best films of the year. All of the positive things I heard people say about Juno are here, and that has everything to do with the script. This reminded me more of Thank You For Smoking, which Jason Reitman also wrote. He is a tremendously talented and young director/writer, and I'm sure he has many great films left in him.
B0031ESW8O|5.0|This book is a page turner!  I work from home which means that I am extremely self motivated person.  I have my work times and my play times.  When I started reading this book though that all went out the window.  I read it from cover to cover without stopping.  I can rationalize and say that I needed the time off from work but that would be a cop out.      This book is that good!    If you are into suspense/mystery types of books then this is the ticket for you!
B0039UTDA6|1.0|I watched the first two episodes of \\"LIFE\\" last night and totally agree with all the negative reviews.  The video and soundtrack music were both fantastic but the narration by Oprah Winfrey was surprisingly juvenile.  I did not appreciate being talked down to and given blatant mispronunciations.  Apparently, DISCOVERY missed the target with her narration.  They can learn much from the BBC version with David Attenborough (that's the version I will be ordering).  This isn't a problem for Amazon since they will be selling both versions and will profit either way.  The fault lies with DISCOVERY...and I watch everything on DISCOVERY.  No other well-known series attempts to talk down to its audience...example:  Mike Rowe from \\"Dirty Jobs\\" is always intelligent and informative.  DISCOVERY forgot that we are smarter than they think we are. They tried the same \\"stuff\\" with the Weaver version of \\"Planet Earth\\"...she did an adequate job and was not insulting as Oprah is but most people I know, including myself, purchased the Attenborough version.  No one can come close to Attenborough and his sensitivies to LIFE !!!
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|I'm an opera, classical, and Celtic music fan. But there's something about K. D. Lang's voice that keeps me coming back for more. This is music I never get tired of listening to. I currently have the album in my car so when I'm driving I can sing along - most of us probably remember the words. I especially liked the remake of Hallajullia.    There's an introduction by Tony Bennett on the album that says it all. She has an amazing voice.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I'm a runner and love the combination of the nano and the Nike + sensor.  I tried running without an armband and it didn't work well to hold the nano when my hands got sweaty.  I love this armband because it protects the nano, and is comfortable to wear (and it still lets me enjoy the color and design of the nano since it is clear plastic).  I have thin arms (they measure about 11 inches where I wear it), and this is just about as small as the armband gets.  Very few armbands work with the Nike + sensor, but this one does. I rarely take the nano out of the case, or the case off the armband, so I can't evaluate the ease of those features. I like the fact that you can sync it while it is still in the case because both the top and bottom are open. The only complaint I have is that it is hard to move the lock button while it is in the case because the case's top opening edge is very close to the button.  Other than that, I highly recommend this product.
B002VECM4A|5.0|What tenacious intensity and brilliance the cast of Lee Daniels' new film, Precious, has. From the powerful, terrifyingly believable performance of comedian and actress Mo'Nique, to the heart-breaking portrayal of the title character by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe, this movie is a gritty, intimate portrait of a young girl who has never had hope in her life, just her dreams and fantasies to comfort her.    Based on the novel Push by Sapphire, Precious tells the story of Clarice Precious Jones, a deeply disturbed and broken down young girl who cannot read or write, and who has one baby girl, and another on the way. Both children were conceived from her father raping her. Precious is fat, her clothes don't fit her right, and she is constantly mocked and cruelly treated by kids at school, and by her mother, Mary (Mo'Nique), at home. Rather than blaming her boyfriend for raping her daughter and getting angry with him, Mary blames Precious for it all, accusing her of both stealing him, and chasing him away.    There is a great deal of despair in Precious' life, and the abuse that she receives at home is by far the most difficult and painful thing to watch in this movie because of how convincing and believable these actors are. However, along with the despair, there is also much inspiration and hope. Ms. Blue Rain (Paula Patton), Precious' alternative school teacher, Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey), a social worker, and even a nurse (Lenny Kravitz) are all people that Precious needs in her life. It is these people who don't simply dismiss Precious as a hopeless girl surviving off of welfare checks. They all see the pain that is rotting inside of her, decaying her soul, and when in her darkest hour, these people reach out a helping hand.     Her mother is not necessarily evil, but rather someone who has been beaten down emotionally, physically, and mentally. She is a hypocrite, however, who has taken that pain and suffering and turned it on her own daughter, instead of channeling itin a more positive way and seeking guidance, which is what Precious is pushed to do. Perhaps that is why her mother never did seek help: no one ever pushed her to do so.    Patton, Kravitz, and Carey all do wonderful work in this film. I would have been skeptical about the casting of Carey and Kravitz maybe a few years ago, but there have been tremendous dramatic turns from music stars in recent years-such as Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges in Crash, and Mos Def in 16 Blocks-that has made me rethink this skepticism. These two continue this trend, and I was thoroughly moved by both of them.     Mo'Nique, Sidibe, Patton, and Carey would have all been suitable oscar contenders, and Mo'Nique earned every inch of her award. The style of the movie, in all respects, is phenomenal. We care about this young girl, and the more she has to push herself to grow, the more we feel for her. It is remarkable how Sidibe has accomplished something so profound here, this being her first acting job. She is electrifying in this movie, and if she should choose to continue acting, I would hope that she keeps every ounce of charisma that she displays here.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|There is zero chance I would order this version. Besides changing the music, a horrible narration, and cutting a hours worth of content for this release, its the BBC version 100% for me. Why Discovery chose not to use the original Attenburough narration again is beyond me.
B000GG4XJM|3.0|I originally bought the dual disc version of this CD but it would not play in my stereo so I gave it to my sister who loves it.   I feel after listing to Live In Dublin that the songs on this album are works in progress.Bruce constantly calls out chord changes in the middle of the songs and there are a few mistakes from the band.   This album has a raw, on the fly feel to it, like a bunch of friends have come together to pay homage to Pete Seger.This is not a bad album but I prefer the synergy of Live In Dublin better.   The bonus material on the DVD is intersting but I will probably not watch it again.The extra songs on this is well worth the extra cost.I just wish they put them on the CD as well because I burn the CD and put the original away to keep it from getting damaged.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|I don't know why I thought this movie would be good.  Typically nowadays disaster films are all about CGI and zero about the character developement and script.  It was HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE, LOUSY ACTING AND JUST PLAIN BORING!     There's not much else to really say.  Danny Glover as the president was moronic and couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.  The rest of the totally forgetable characters (I can't even remember any of their names!) were not expanded, developed, or cared about at all. The CGI was great but good movies aren't built on CGI, as history has shown, but Hollywood still doesn't get it.  I invest time in these films and they disappoint everytime.      Don't wsate your time.
B0034JGBM0|5.0|I have been a fan since they first started.  Everything Jack White does is quality in my opinion.  I would rank this live album up there with \\"Get your Ya Ya's\\" and \\"Live At Leeds.\\"  It sounds awesome on headphones but I think you really need to let the music breathe on quality open air speakers.    The only thing I wish is that there would have been more songs from De Stil. You can't have everything I guess.    I saw these guys in Detroit when Jack White was actually in the opening band as well.  Good to see him doing so well.

Prepare yourself for 509 pages of suspense-filled fiction that will have you up at 3 A.M. to read like I did three nights in a row, in order to finish and have the final answer, or rather, the location and meaning of the lost symbol.<br /><br />What a wonderful read. Major kudos to you, Dan Brown. Not too many books can make me deliberately lose my sleep in order to hurry and find an answer.

0307463745|4.0|I must admit that being a software craftsman, I had been a big fan of the \\"Getting Real\\" book from 37signals that come out in 2006 which talks about a smaller, faster, better way to build software and religious follower of their \\"Signal vs. Noise\\" blog. To me \\"Rework\\" is an extension of \\"Getting Real\\" in the Entrepreneurship world where most of agile software development practices can be leveraged by a business has been illustrated in chapters such as \\"Planning is guessing\\", \\"Ignore the details early on\\", \\"Less mass\\", \\"Getting it out there\\" etc. which has the power to turn a new business into a success story. \\"Rework\\" layout is exceptional as the chapters are between 1-3 pages only with bird eye focus on the title with concrete real world examples.    Having an appetite for business, there were several key take away for me with the prominent one being \\"Scratch your own itch\\" - How many times do we think while solving a problem that there might be others out there going through the same problem that may need our solution? Being a software person, I not only research various open source frameworks solutions out there that might be helpful for my current project but also look for opportunities to contribute solutions that I had worked on, back to the open source world if I think it would be useful for others. The objective while developing my own solutions if I don't find any available is to learn from a real problem by \\"Start making something\\" and \\"Making a dent in the Universe\\".  You can market your solutions of a real world problem to others which may very well be a start of a successful business for you.    The concept of \\"Interruption is the enemy of productivity\\" resonates with me to the core as a software developer, I very well know how destructive the interruptions can be to a developer's rhythm - these interruptions could be long meetings or other personal distractions such as phone calls, IMs etc. This concept is not necessarily an enemy of collaboration, which I think, is very important but as long as the collaboration is focused towards your business objective. In the real business world as well, you can have numerous interruptions come your way - but the successful businessmen is the one that steers clear of them keeping the focus on the business objective.    This book also challenged a lot of my core concepts such as \\"Ignore the real world\\", \\"Learn from your success instead from your mistakes\\" etc. that actually challenges these built notions which has been negatively impacting achieving success for me in the real world. I would like to end this review with a statement in the book that struck me the most \\"You just need an idea, a touch of confidence, and a push to get started.\\"     So what are you waiting for?!

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I am not a movie fan.  When I watch a movie with my wife, it is usually without enthusiasm, and I generally find myself sneaking peeks at my watch every few minutes, calculating how much longer the movie will run.  Prior to seeing the story of \\"Hachi\\", Richard Gere meant little to me.  His portrayal of the master of \\"Hachi\\", though, was moving, sweet, and ingratiating.  Mr. Gere is the most prominent actor in a fine cast, which helps to make this movie transformational.  The story depicts with love and sensitivity the strong and indelible bond between man and his eternal best friend, the dog.  Hachi is a loving akita who is loyal to the character played by Mr. Gere, seeming to always remember that it was Gere who rescued the lost pup at a train station.  Originally intending to find the rightful owner of the dog, something which did not ever happen despite significant initial effort, the two quickly become inseparable, devoted companions.  Theirs was a devotion which transcended death.  Following the sudden and untimely passing of the character played by Mr. Gere, Hachi continued to wait at the train station at which he would greet his master when he returned home from work each day.  Certain scenes and premises are implausible, such as when years after his death, the master's widow returns to the area the two had lived in together, surprised to see Hachi at his daily perch in the town square, as he had done for years.  The bittersweet and moving reunion between the two renders the implausability of the scene unimportant.  This movie is all the more powerful in consideration of the fact that it is based on a true story from Japan, in which Hachi lived in the 1920's and 1930's.  Hachi is honored with a statue on the site of his daily vigil, and is memorialized by Japanese dog-lovers every year to this day.  The story of Hachi is one that I cannot get out of my mind, and it shall always be dear to me.  At a time in which our world is becoming increasingly coarse and uncivil, how wonderful to find an uplifting and inspirational movie like this, and it is rated 'G'!  Everyone who loves and is sensitive to animals, everyone with a heart and soul, should see it.  You will be glad you did.  You should be prepared to be overcome with emotion.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|Some years back when I first heard this album on vinyl I wasn't sure if I cared for it too much. Because it didn't contain any big blockbuster hit songs that burst out at me it seemed like something that was all too easy to ignore. When I recently listened to this album over again on the remastered CD I have a new opinion on it. Already haven taken the step to begin adding new elements to his sound,particularly a heavy soul and funk influence on his previous album [[ASIN:B00014TJ6G Thirty Three & 1/3]] he then took the time on this album to bring in the usual musical charges such as Gary Wright,Clapton along with Steve Winwood for an album that was a true departure for him and a very liberating musical experience. This album doesn't contain as much,if any at all of the melodic pop/rock style of The Beatles that was very common on his earlier albums and makes an effort to alter the nature of his arrangements to accomodate a different style. As illustrated by the soft focus photo of George on the album cover this album is by and large a rich,glossy and melodic affair with songs that are generally mid to lower tempo. \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\" sets the stage as a sweetly grooving urban R&B type groove that,as with everything here is a big counterpoint to the disco and heartland rock dominating radio during this time. \\"Not Guilty\\",the one Beatle era tune here is presented with a relaxed Caberet type jazz arrangement.\\"Here Comes The Moon\\",\\"Blow Away\\",\\"Faster\\",\\"Soft Touch\\",Your Love Is Forever\\" and \\"If You Believe\\" all have a glistening,optimistic late 70's singer-songwriter vibe to them. Producing the album along with Russ Titelman really added to the heavy sheen the music on this album contains. George's slide guitar is played down here as he strums pretty much in the style he probably used while writing the songs and some of his riffs are mildly more jazzy than usual. The likeminded \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\" is a kind hearted,loving type of musical wedding present to his second wife Olivia and I am sure she more than appreciate the gesture because it's one of this album's highlites.\\"Soft Hearted Hana\\" of all things takes a note from Paul McCartney type of musical hall pop and,being somewhat different in that respect is truly a highlite here as well. The demo of \\"Here Comes The Moon\\" is here as the bonus cut and is a pleasant unplugged style version of the tune that really gives you something of a peek into how Harrison composed his songs. While bearing little resemblance to what came before and after it,as well as being George Harrison's least obviously rock styled efforts this album is actually one of George's most individual and in every respect has well stood the test of time and changes on the pop music front.present to his second wife Olivia and I am sure she more than appreciate the gesture because it's one of this album's highlites.\\"Soft Hearted Hana\\" of all things takes a note from Paul McCartney type of musical hall pop and,being somewhat different in that respect is truly a highlite here as well.

B0012GMVG2|5.0|In a lot of ways 1982 was a key year in pop music. The mission of a lot of groups and musicians around this time had a lot to do with the fact they were all basically trying to create blockbuster albums that were still very much in the spirit of their classic sound. Now for a group of huge and very talented session men Toto hadn't really done too bad for themselves after their excellent self titled debut-basically as a somewhat rockier version of Steely Dan or Pablo Cruise in the general sceme of  LA pop/rock groups. What really locks this album down musically is the Porcaro brothers,particularly Jeff on drums.  Perhaps it's just personal bias but considering the talents of these precision based musicians but after the lack of success accorded to their previous album [[ASIN:B0012GN32I Turn Back]] that when it came to producing rock songs their tight studio based sound made some of the simplistic riffing usually associated with rock n roll sound kind of stiff. True it can be done but,to be honest Toto's technical prowess tended to flatten out rockier songs here such as \\"Afraid Of Love\\",\\"We Made It\\" and \\"Lovers In The Night\\". These are all great compositions and the music is impeccable but when Steve Lukather breaks out the hard rock electric axe on these songs there just isn't the kind of spark that someone like Walter Becker or Larry Carlton could achieve when doing a rockier riff. Much better to me on the rockier front is \\"It's A Feeling\\",a tune with a poppier jazz field where Steve is playing in a more acoustic style with a nicely chorded jazz-pop style tune. \\"Make Believe\\" and \\"Good For You\\" both have an old timey R&B shuffle to them and some great harmony vocals,adding to the magic created by singer Bobby Kimball. Now you know me;a lot of the times my favorite songs are the ones that never became hits but in this case the two hits here are the ones that made me take notice of Toto in the first place. \\"Rosanna\\" is one of those pop songs where the drumming is one of the most important parts of the songs and is given plenty of space to be heard. \\"Africa\\" is perhaps one of the best tunes Toto ever did,with it's super percussion,great jazz-funk-pop groove and amazing hook-just a song where everything works. I know a lot of people aren't too into this song but \\"Waiting For Your Love\\" is in fact one of my favorite tracks on this album. With it's lite jazz-funk groove this song to me actually epidomizes a good direction for this album to have gone. Bobby Kimball was a huge vocal asset to Toto and his presense would be missed after this,considering he was part of what made the best songs here even better. Even if there are some songs here that will hit different audiences differently that was the point;to reach out to a broad array of people rather than a particular audience.where the drumming is one of the most important parts of the songs and is given plenty of space to be heard. \\"Africa\\" is perhaps one of the best tunes Toto ever did,with it's super percussion,great jazz-funk-pop groove and amazing hook-just a song where everything works.

B0025X4PL0|5.0|This could be called progressive rock, but not if you think of prog as cheesy late 70s music chock full of dated-sounding mellotrons (although Oceansize does, at times, use mellotrons), lyrics that might as well be excerpts from The Lord Of The Rings, and endless guitar solos that sound like they belong in porn movies. Frames, the latest album by Oceansize, is progressive rock in that the music progresses. Sounding like a group of theoretical physicists who double-majored in music, Oceansize put out complex harmonies, rapidly changing time signatures, and polyrhythms that Einstein couldn't understand    But enough about how complex the music is, Frames is strikingly beautiful, even in the most intense head-banging metal moments. Refusing to conform to pop standards seems to be the group's goal. Only Twin, one of the album's best, is a song that no other group in the world could pull off; the song has a 3/4 time signature, so naturally, when the drums and guitar arrive in 5/8 time signature they'll seem out of place. After listening for a while, you will start to understand what's going on, and that it works. That's the thing about this band, is that behind the bizarre math-rock exterior, for those who pay close attention, it WORKS. Savant is a breathtakingly beautiful song with surreal lyricism that introduces a string section and gradually removes the rhythm section to create a baroque sounding string-piece at the end. Unfamiliar shows how Oceansize are excelllent at using hooks without abusing them to the point where you want to puke. No song on this album has a verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure, making the album a surprising, adventurous affair the whole way through.    Do not be deterred by the fact that I only mentioned only a few tracks. There are no \\"fillers\\" here. Only moments of pure genius that keep you starving for more. Since Oceansize transcends profiteering conformities and catchy singles, you won't even have to think about reaching for the skip button. For those who listen to highly produced chart-porn, don't even think about buying this album. You need to have an attention span, and an open mind to appreciate the true genius of Oceansize.
B002LL13BQ|5.0|I am not a professional musician and lack the skill to critique each turn of phrase and musical subtlety.  I am a devoted listener and observer who wants to be moved by the characters and music.  This stage performance achieves that with great impact.  The principals look right, they sound great and the staging gives the characters the background they need to bring the story and music home in the best light.  It isn't necessary to suspend belief and imagine that over-age, over-weight singers are something they are not.  This isn't the only excellent video presentation, but it is near as a person is likely to get to attending and outstanding live performance.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I occasionally will try watching a show starting from the first season and catch up to where I can continue watching it on tv. I did that with this show and am very pleased I did. I like shows like Lost, Stargate & Stargate Atlantis, South Park, Simpsons, King of Queens, House, Bones, and Csi(Vegas).    I love playing Oblivion, which is pretty much like this show, I just didn't realize I would like a Medieval Type show because I'm not a fan of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. After two episodes of this show I was hooked.    The characters are pleasant to watch and the story lines are always extremely interesting and never fail to keep me wanting more. The scenery is absolutely beautiful and the actors are wonderful. I hope this show will bring many many more seasons. Give this show a shot, I'm sure it'll grow on you, like it did on me.
B00102F5WK|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I fully expected the director, Gavin Hood, to dish up the same kind of bland Hollywood moralizing as he did in Crash. Instead, Hood's treatment of this politically charged subject was thoughtful, accurate and well told.<br /><br />The subject matter is, of course, rendition--the policy of seizing an individual and transporting him (usually a man) to a foreign country so as to circumvent US law (which would require due process). Once extradited, the individual has no rights. He can be tortured and held for an unlimited period of time without any formal accusation. He can be killed.<br /><br />Without going into the plot of the movie, which has been covered by other reviewers, I would like to say that based on my personal experience with the \\"disappearance\\" of individuals for political reasons, this movie was highly accurate. The only difference between Argentina's policy of disappearing \\"delinquents\\" during the Dirty War and our policy of doing the same to \\"terrorists\\" is terminology. Whether you call your enemies \\"delinquents\\", \\"communists\\", \\"terrorists\\", or \\"Jews\\" the end result is the same--the total destruction of the rule of law. What is so disturbing about this film, and the current policy of rendition, is that the damage is no longer limited to national borders. By transporting individuals to secret prisons all over the world, we have, in effect, created an international dictatorship in which no individual of any nationality has a right to due process. Once that notion takes hold, the law of the jungle is the only law there is. Those who are hired to capture, torture and transport \\"terrorists\\" will do so indiscriminately, and according to their own notions of what constitutes a threat to international security. (For example, I have heard members of the Guatemalan military claim that all Mayan Indians are \\"born terrorists\\".)<br /><br />This film is for those with strong stomachs, but if you find that the torture scenes are too tense for you, don't simply put the movie away. Be sure to watch \\"Outlawed\\", the documentary included in the special features. This was Hood's reason for making the film. Not only is the documentary deeply moving, it gives an absolutely clear argument for why rendition has made a mockery of everything the United States stands for.on't simply put the movie away.

B002KGKH5A|5.0|This video is an adventure. It's the second White Stripes live DVD, following the concert-only Under Blackpool Lights. This DVD, however, is more of a documentary with live shows thrown in, rather than a concert DVD.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the Stripes, they are a Detroit-based duo of Jack and Meg White (whom Jack presents as brother/sister though they were actually married AND divorced before their second album was released). Jack loves novelties and is obsessed with the number 3, and the band's motif of red, white, and black. If you are a fan of most types of rock, you will love them (or at least some of their assorted songs, there's at least one for everyone). I watched this with my parents (my mom loves Elvis and my dad is a Zeppelin fan), and immediately afterward they wanted me to add the White Stripes to their computers/iPods.<br /><br />The movie follows the band as they tour each Canadian province and play shows, not only in concert halls, but in parks, on boats, on buses, in schools, and with native Canadians. It gives you a look into the day-to-day of Jack and Meg, and what their ambitions for the band and themselves are as far as the tour goes; Jack also gives great insight into what direction he follows and what creative process he uses for the band. Meg even talks, and they talk about why she never talks, to some laughs for those of us who know Meg as a shy, rarely-interviewed introvert. Interspersed as well are the novelty concerts that are paired with each major show, which show really not the novelty of each show but of Jack and Meg themselves, two oddballs with an idea that a band can be creative within the confines of an idea and a motif, and to explore this motif to its limit.<br /><br />Now, on to the concerts themselves: blown away. Jack's live shows are heartfelt performances, and he plays to each different audience as if it were a group of his closest friends, knowing exactly what songs to play, including the fa- favorite B-Sidecover version of Dolly Parton's \\"Jolene,\\" which always seems so passionate (even though it's told from the point of view of a woman). Each song is a concert-ready version of its album counterpart, generally not played the same way (\\"Fell In Love With A Girl\\" uses chords strummed individually with little distortion, as opposed to the ever-popular studio version), and you can see that they work to make each show special. They play without a set list, and so it's more of a jam session of your favorite White Stripes songs. When Jack plays the B-Side Black Jack Davey in a park with Meg on the tambourine, giving very little or no notice that they were playing there, it conjures images of Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. It's those small town where maybe they've never even heard anything the Stripes have done, only in name do they know them, maybe a rumor of their tour of Canada, but you can tell the people know something special is happening, and in each town a crowd gathers that is very substantial for how small the town itself is.<br /><br />By the end of the tour, you can see why they canceled their U.S. tour: they seem very weary and stressed out. And when the video ends with Meg crying as Jack plays piano and sings \\"White Moon\\", you can tell they've been stretched thin, but it seems like they loved the journey, and you will, too.
B002ZG4QB6|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.  I was at the 02 concert where this was filmed and it bought back so many memories.  It contains all of the hits and also some scenes taken at the rehearsal before the show.  If you are a Cliff Richards fan you will love it.  I also liked the two sets by the Shadows on their own with all of their hits.  Once in a while they scan the audience which I like.  The crowd was really enjoying themselves.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I felt compelled to join the chorus of praise. I just happened to watch the movie, Serenity, and only then discovered its source. Improbably, my local public library had the whole DVD set of the TV series, which I just finished watching last night. I am heartbroken that it's over and there's no more, we're done here. However, I am now going to buy a blu-ray player so I can watch it all over in that format (and the movie). What a shame the series was canceled, but my watching the DVD set was like a passionate but too-short affair. Better to have loved and lost...

Upon using them, I was pissed. Cheap plastic, no durability. Sound quality is terrible. I would rather listen to the game through my tv speakers, at least then I wouldn't get the annoying static that is always present. One week later I spent 80 bucks on Tritton 720s and haven't looked back. This product should be only for people who can't notice sound quality or have never used a surround sound system before.

So while the BBC edition isn't availble on Amazon.com until June 1'st, it's available now (even used) on Amazon.co.uk.    I recommend this route to anyone that wants to enjoy the show how it's meant to be enjoyed without having to wait till the summer to do so.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I've only watched about a half dozen clips or so on YouTube and I could barely even stand that. The footage is phenomenal, but Oprah's narration is SO distracting. I couldn't quite put my finger on why it was so off-putting until I read some of the other reviews here on amazon, and they're right, it's because she sounds like a kindergarten teacher when she narrates. Its way too simplified and made me feel like an idiot while I was watching it (I rolled my eyes many times).<br /><br />I don't understand why she's even narrating this in the first place, David Attenborough already did. Why attempt to replace the irreplaceable? It's odd that they left his narration on the Discovery Channel original broadcast of Blue Planet, (which was immensely successful) but then replaced him with Weaver for Planet Earth.<br /><br />He's been narrating nature documentaries for decades now, and he's not getting any younger. Discovery should be ecstatic that the legendary David Attenborough is still alive and well and willing to work, not replace him with a talk show host. It's disgraceful, and when you can buy the original Attenborough narrated version right here on amazon, I see no reason to buy this inferior (putting it very mildly) product.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I bought this movie because I like Christina Ricci anyway, but I fell in love with the story.  The story is so good that the moral is basically your own conclusion at the end.  You love Penelope for who she is just as she does.
0380820846|3.0|Was Romancing Mr. Bridgerton well-written?  Sure.  Was it pleasant?  Absolutely.  Ms. Quinn always writes well, and her characters are witty and charming.  Unfortunately, all the witty turns-of-phrase and arch glances in the world can't make up for an obvious lack of inspiration.
6305428522|5.0|I remember seeing QUIZ SHOW in the theater some fifteen years ago and being really impressed.  I loved the film just as much when I viewed it on DVD last night.  The movie may take a few liberties with the actual happenings of the quiz show scandals of the late 50's but it stays close to the facts while telling the story concisely and understandably to those who have little background about the events.  And the film nostalgically and genuinely portrays New York City in the 1950's.    John Turturro is excellent as Herb Stempel a nerdy young Jewish guy from Queens with an encyclopedia like mind and a nagging wife.  Because of certain attributes Turturro gives Stempel I can't help but wonder if Herb would now be diagnosed as someone with Aspberger's Syndrome.  Ralph Fiennes is equally good in his role as the White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, Charlie Van Doran, a Columbia University instructor who is the son and nephew of Pulitzer Prize winners.  Not quite as good is Rob Morrow playing Richard Goodwin the young government lawyer who goes after the quiz show cheats. I found Morrow's Brookline accent grating, perhaps because I am more used to hearing him without it on the 90's hit NORTHERN EXPOSURE.  Interestingly enough as of this writing the real  Herb Stempel, Charlie Van Doran and Richard Goodwin are alive and more can be found out about what happened to them by googling their names and finding their Wikipedia entries.  And YouTube even provides some vintage footage of Stempel, Van Doran and game show host Jack Barry on the game show, \\"Twenty-one\\".     QUIZ SHOW is an entertaining, thought provoking drama that can be enjoyed by a wide audience.  And I loved the two versions of MACK THE KNIFE that bookend the film.
1878424505|4.0|This classic book is short in pages, but contains a lot of strong ideas from old Toltecs, which have both soothing and empowering effect. The four agreements (there is no need to repeat them here as it has be done in many other reviews) together make compact package and I believe they create a very solid foundation of a philosophy for whole life.  Most interesting topics/ideas for me:  - How our opinions are formed during childhood and how we grow up used to doing things to please others and forgetting about our own desires.  - Clear communication (I want this, you want this, let's solve it) solves most of (all?) problems.  - Our harmful words damage more us than they damage those for whom they were intended originally.    If the topics were discussed a little more deeply, I would give it 5 stars...this way I give four.
0385528752|4.0|This is a fun, entertaining and informative book that succeeds in providing an interesting framework to define/analyze/effect \\"change\\".  Other reviewers have very ably summarized some of the key insights and the narration style.     Even though the narration and the use of well-chosen examples (not a surprise for repeat readers of Heaths) presents an seemingly convincing framework, one cannot help but wonder if there is a variation of what behavioral scientists call \\"confirmatory bias\\" in these discussions.  Clearly, the savior of the St Lucian parrots or the Vietnam nutrition activist and the countless other examples mentioned by the authors didn't do what they did thinking they will end up as Exhibit A in an excellent book.  They didn't have the benefit of the framework and yet succeeded.  So, perhaps, picking and choosing these examples to fit a pre-defined conceptual framework, shortchanges the concept itself. Who knows how many people tried similar or identical methods and failed! That could indicate that it is very dangerous to attribute a success (or a failure) to suit one's preconceived notions of any conceptual framework. This is not necessarily a knock on the book itself, but one needs to be aware of the limitations of cherry-picked examples, particularly with no counter examples.       A more serious reader may have benefited from a rigorous debate on the framework itself or what I think was one of the fundamental premises of the authors (buried deep in page 154, \\"thats why it is so clumsy when people reach for incentives to change other peoples behavior\\").  A recent book [[ASIN:1594488843 Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]] seems to argue the opposite - incentives work and they work best in terms of motivating changes.  Perhaps the truth is a composite of these two (and many other) viewpoints.  To me, this differentiation, and the discussion on identity/consequences model alone is worth investing in this book.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I first heard Last Request on Palladia TV and was blown away.  I thought, \\"why haven't I heard this song before and why does everyone in the audience know about it?\\"  I bought the CD on Amazon and it does not disappoint.  All of the songs have a similar ambience, so if you like Last Request you will love the whole CD.  No turkeys on this CD!  I like Paolo's voice a lot.  He has a sweet falsetto and a sweet lyrical, modern, soulful quality that is very nice to hear.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|I also attempted to watch this on Discovery Channel tonight.  Whoever made the decision to replace David Attenborough with Oprah for the US version should be fired immediately.  I'm extremely disappointed that they allowed Oprah to ruin what should have been an amazing program.

B000002H97|4.0|Metallica's 5th studio album, the Black Album or just Metallica is a good album overall. It's not as good as their '80 discography and it's far more accessible than And Justice For All. It was very heavy, technical and under-produced. The Black Album is more mellow and it's more hard rock than thrash/progressive metal. The songs are less complex, very polished and well produced and a more radio friendly and mainstream sound. It's their best selling album to date and it went 15x platinum in The United States. It's not as good as their older albums but Wherever I May Roam is my favorite Metallica song of all time, at least my favorite radio hit.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|The release of this DVD and Blu Ray is BS.  They have released other movies in 3D why not this one? Most recently Final Destination and Coraline were available in 3D. Because they can make money from the ill informed. They will be able to cash in on the initial release and then the holiday crowd in November. They claim that they want to wait until more people have 3D TV sets in their home.  Can someone explain to me why we need 3D TV's? I can go and buy a 3D movie and watch it on my current TV. Why can't they just broadcast in 3D format and all we need to get are the glasses. I see it as an upgrade in the future just like HDTV. I think they will eventually do this and 3D TV sets will end up like laser disc.  But I may be wrong.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This is an excellent album by Michael Buble'. He can do standards with pizzaz and rock standards and pop with enthusiasm and a new, unique twist making them totally his own. \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" is a catchy upbeat tune and \\"Cry Me A River\\" is dramatic and powerful. If you love standards and pop tunes with a different perspective and a wonderful voice to deliver them then this album is for you!
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is their worst of their '80s discography and it's very overrated. It's still a classic and all of the songs are amazing though. Personally, I'd take Ride the Lightning or Justice for All any day. Maybe since it was their last with Cliff Burton, it's so popular but even before he died it was when Metallica made their mainstream breakthrough and got really popular. It defines their sound a lot and the band matures here, more progressive than their first 2. Still  Battery, Welcome Home (Sanitarium) and Damage Inc. are some of their best songs ever.

0140277447|5.0|I just finished this, not 10 minutes ago. I started reading it this morning. This book is the definitive historical account of an event which likely started with the U.S. forcing of Japan's opening in the 19th century. Yes, that IS a radical statement. If Admiral Perry hadn't forced U.S. interests on Japan, Nanjing and the war in the Pacific likely wouldn't have occurred. It is time for people to look critically at the effects of imperialism and this book lists them in graphic detail.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for everyone. The details of the European theater are well known, but American and European centric views tend to put Asian atrocities in second class spaces. 19 million Chinese were killed in northern China during WWII, did you know that? You will after reading Ms. Chang's incredible research. Were you aware that between the Nanjing incident itself and the march on Nanjing that over 700,000 Chinese civilians died? Yep. Although she didn't calculate the totals, when you keep a running tally of the deaths, that's the number.<br /><br />Its time that people of European descent look carefully at how our own history is taught in school. I'm in my 40s, and this was not in my history classes. My son is 16, and it is covered a bit. As someone who has spent 20 years immersed in Chinese culture, I first learned of this from Chinese sources. I was stunned when my Japanese friends told me of their views that these incidents did not occur.<br /><br />Japan needs to atone for these crimes. The United States needs to acknowledge that our own imperialism played a key role and continues to play a key role in the deaths of millions.<br /><br />Read this book as one step toward viewing history on a global scale, not a Eurocentric scale.
0385737424|5.0|To put it simply, When You Reach Me was by far one of the best middle grade books I have read.     I did find myself confused at first. I was worried at first, but once I got the \\"feel\\" for the story, I really started to enjoy it. New York in the 70's was a fun setting. Back in a time where middle schoolers could walk in the city without an adult and some kids were even \\"latch-key kids\\" like our protagonist, Miranda.    I'm not going to even try to explain the plot, because it's great and complicated and I wouldn't be able to do it justice. But the story is contained with phenomenal writing. There really isn't one genre that fits this story. You could say it was historical fiction because of the setting, Sci-fi with the time traveling, a mystery with the notes anonymously left for Miranda that might prevent a death, and a coming of age story with how much Miranda grows and deals with throughout.    The characters were fantastic. They really came to life in my mind as I was reading. I love Miranda. She wasn't the cliche girl you usually see in middle grade novels. Miranda loved the story A Wrinkle In Time, which you hear alot about in the story. This seemed to be what alot of people enjoyed about the story, but since I have never read A Wrinkle In Time and have no attachment to it, it didn't really have an effect on me either way. But I did enjoy learning about the famous tale.     For such a quick read, When You Reach Me holds alot of excitement. It was a refreshing read that was like nothing I have ever read. For me, this one lived up to all the hype. I think you just have to remember that it is a middle grade read when you go into it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Written by my 10 year-old...    Hachi was the first movie in which I cried, but it was all worth it. The film is basically about a dog (Hachi) that falls out of his crate and is found by Parker (Richard Gere). Parker's first plan was to find Hachi's owner, but noone claims him, so he keeps him. Parker is a professor in music and rides a train to work everyday. Hachi soon starts coming to the train station everyday to wait for Parker when his train gets back from work. Then tragedy strikes. Parker does not come home, but Hachi continues to come back everyday. He is fed by locals who think that Hachi is a great dog because he is so loyal. Hachi seems to know that Parker isn't coming back, and starts sleeping at the train station, sitting in front of the train station's doors. This goes on for the next ten years. The real Hachi died in March of 1934. At the end it shows a flashback of Hachi and Parker that made me cry. I think it must have been very hard on Parker's family even though they didn't show it all. The family's daughter recently got married and is expecting her first child. Their son never knew his grandfather, but thinks Hachi is a hero.
0553382179|5.0|I just want to say that I found this book one day at a bookshop browsing.  I was pregnant with my first child.

0307454541|3.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo contains scenes depicting gruesome animal cruelty and hideous violence against women. If you are a cat or bird lover, do not read this book. You will not be able to forget the horrible things described here. The writer, Steig Larrson, had to be a very sick man to want to put these dreadful images in his readers' minds. It is upsetting that none of the glowing reviews mention that anyone who loves animals will be disturbed by this book.<br /><br />That being said, I did finish the book, even looking up the mispronouncable Swedish names of things. It is a compelling story with interesting characters, just like all the reviews say...but I do not recommend this book and I will never read anything else he has written.
B00275EGX8|2.0|I bought and watched the Hurt Locker (Blu-Ray DVD)weeks before the Academy Awards. I also watched Avatar at the local cinema theater before the Oscars. So when the entertainment reporters began naming the Hurt Locker as a possible pick to upset Avatar as the best picture of the year,I thought that would be an absurdity. Imagine my shock and dismay when the reporters were right in their prediction! My thought then was \\"WHAT A TRAVESTY!!! In no way did the Hurt Locker come close to being the best picture. My own feeling is that the voters of Academy members voted to spite Mr. Cameron who stood to make history by directing the two all time grossing movies - the Titanic and Avatar. They knew that Mr. Cameron was about to achieve a feat of titanic proportions and set out to deny him that. The Hurt Locker is as undeserving of the best picture honor as President Obama was of the Nobel Peace Prize. Is it merely a coincidence that, like Obama, the Hurt Locker promotes and glorifies militarism. If the members were looking to make history by naming the first woman to win the Best Director and Best Picture categories, they chose the wrong movie to make that history. Their choice fell flat, in my opinion. I am returning my purchase of the Hurt Locker to Amazon in protest. Avatar will always be the Best Picture of 2010 for me. Ms Bigelow meet President Obama as undeserving winner of an honor.!!!

B00275EGWY|3.0|With competition like the outstanding `District 9' and the visually stunning `Avatar' released in 3-D in 2009 (not to mention `The Blind Side'), it's difficult to understand how Kathryn Bigelow's film could justifiably be considered the best film of the year by the Academy. Life is full of surprises.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker of the title refers to a box of bomb parts, fuses and detonators which Sgt William James, the main character at the centre of the story, keeps under his bed. These are souvenirs of all the bombs that almost killed him, but didn't. The film has a few plus points: building of tension, the realism of the environment (filmed in Jordan with Iraqi ex-pats playing Iraqi citizens and insurgents) and conveying the lethality and horror of the work the EOD team do. However there are too many shortcomings for this to be a great film, and classic status is an unlikely future.<br /><br />First of all, there is no real plot or development of character and the story goes nowhere. From a straw poll of people I know who have also seen the film the audience does not easily warm to the three main players and frankly doesn't much care what happens to them. I certainly didn't. The characters are only one step beyond cardboard cut-outs.<br /><br />Secondly, bomb disposal teams in the real world do not risk their own lives and those of colleagues recklessly by defusing lethal ordnance by hand when small robot vehicles are perfectly capable of doing the job, as shown in the first scene - not more than once anyway, without facing serious disciplinary action. The `maverick hero challenging staid authority' theme, a favorite staple of Hollywood, is pushed to incredulity here.<br /><br />Thirdly, even a viewer who has not served in the military can see many of the anomalies which make the whole film look sloppy. Three guys in an EOD team repeatedly alone in a potentially hostile environment, with no supporting infantry or cover? Come on. The new pixelated uniforms are anachronistic for 2004, when the film is supposed to be set. When the main protagonist James - a serving US Army sergeant no less - hijacks a shady DVD-seller's car by holding a gun to the guy's head and orders him to drive to the house of a murdered young boy's family, well, at that point I'm afraid suspension of disbelief went too far. The whole scene was utterly preposterous, pure fantasy, unreal: the very worst of Hollywood is no less believable than this. The three's subsequent race through dark alleyways in Baghdad at night with flashlights on their helmets searching for suspected bombers (LIGHTED FLASHLIGHTS ON THEIR HELMETS FOR GOD'S SAKE!) well, Kathryn, you lost my interest. That's just plain stupid. Then the leg-wounded Sergeant Eldridge is evacuated in an ancient Vietnam-era Huey helicopter. In 2004. Yeah.<br /><br />Why not get these details right? It's not difficult. Because these numerous gaffes are not compensated by plot, storyline, script or anything else to hold the viewer's interest, boredom and impatience set in so that the anomalies come into sharper focus.<br /><br />Considering the relatively modest (by current Hollywood standards) budget the film does look gritty and real. It actually looks like Iraq. Competent direction and editing ensure the film is a white-knuckle rollercoaster of tension for much of the running time but because of insufficient episodes of light and shade the tension paradoxically starts to become monotonous and loses its edge. The hand-held camera work, used so effectively by Spielberg in `Saving Private Ryan' to convey chaotic, combat-urgent realism, is appropriate but hardly original and has been done better by others. And who were those Brits disguised as Arabs in the middle of the desert supposed to be? Mercenaries? Special Forces? We're not told. They seem to be featured to remind American viewers there are other foreign forces in Iraq and so it's confusing, and this particular crew's main function seems to be to get shot dead in the fire-fight to add to the drama.<br /><br />On the positive side, the film is refreshingly apolitical and does not (unlike `Avatar') preach to the audience and tell them what they should think. The political views of the writer/director are not put into the mouths of the actors, and the viewer is left to make up his own mind what he thinks about the wisdom or folly of the conflict in a broader geopolitical context.<br /><br />The short scene near the end of the film with James back home with his wife and young son, engaged with the banalities of everyday suburban life like cleaning leaves from rain drains and shopping at the supermarket, is understated and well, OK. However, we have no feeling of the relationship between James and his wife or why he should choose to leave his infant son and return to his lethal work in Iraq except the premise that `war/life-threatening danger is a drug, an addiction.' Yeah, profound. This could have been a rich and powerful dramatic scene if handled well but the opportunity is lost and the theme is not convincingly explored.<br /><br />Dare one suspect the Academy's best film and best direction awards decisions were guided by sensitivity to the essentially worthy subject matter of `The Hurt Locker' and the feeling that to pass over this film might be seen as an insult to the serving soldiers in Iraq? That to award the Oscar to Bigelow's ex-husband's `Avatar' might be seen as confirmation that Hollywood is just about escapist entertainment spectaculars and simplistic, PC-driven new-age platitudes? Maybe the Oscar was awarded to Bigelow on gender grounds to have a female director win for the first time, even though the film itself barely deserves it. We can only speculate. Not a good decision on artistic grounds because although `The Hurt Locker' is not an outright bad film, it's not very good either. A better film with this subject matter might have been made. The other major war-themed movie of 2009, `Inglorious Basterds' although containing all Tarantino's violent fantasy-comic-book excesses, nevertheless has a tight and clever plot, strongly defined characters, superlative script, wicked black humor and an outstanding denoument which puts it way ahead of Bigelow's thinner offering as a satisfying viewing experience.drama.

B000EMG9EU|5.0|This album has always been a great companion for \\"Daydream Nation,\\" and the band had actually wanted the two records be released simultaneously. Someone close to the band wisely encouraged them to release \\"Ciccone Youth\\" a few months later so as not to detract attention from their masterpiece, \\"Daydream Nation.\\"<br /><br />But that doesn't mean \\"Ciccone Youth\\" isn't a masterpiece in its own right. It's simply a much more playful recording, being, in its own strange way, a tribute to Madonna (though only two Madonna songs are actually covered, one by Sonic Youth, and one by Mike Watt of the Minutemen, by himself). In one sense, especially in this rerelease version with the extra tracks, this album is more \\"traditional\\" Sonic Youth than \\"Daydream Nation\\" simply in the sense that it is far noisier. In another sense, however, it is unlike anything by them, as there is an emphasis in various songs on dance rhythms and sound manipulations.<br /><br />If you're primarily a fan of earlier, darker Sonic Youth releases, don't be scared away by the term \\"dance rhythms.\\" Just listen to a sample of the sludgy version of \\"Into the Groove(y)\\" to understand how Sonic Youth uses, and undermines, dance rhythms, on this record. On the occasions in the record when they employ such rhythms, they appear to be both mocking and embracing pop culture at the same time, something for which they are uniquely suited.<br /><br />All in all, one hell of an album.
0345495004|4.0|I read this book for my book club.  We haven't reviewed it at a meeting yet, but I think most of our members will say they enjoyed it.  It seemed well-researched.  The novelist imagined how Mamah would have felt during the years of her affair with Frank Lloyd Wright.  I think she did an admirable job of bringing the era and the characters to life.  It was a page-turner for me.  I was interested in the characters through-out - and the ending was a big surprise.      I would recommend this book for people who are interested in Wright's architecture and intrigued by his reputation.  The author seemed to know her subjects well and did a creative job presenting the story of their love. It is a book I will remember.
B002U33GUQ|5.0|This album represents Brad Mehldau's fine ability as a composer,player & orchestrater.  Mehldau is joined once again with producer Jon Brion who's first record with Melhdau 2001's Largo in my opinion was a semi success.  I believe this time around with Highway Rider the nine years of experience & several classical pieces Melhdau has written have given him the right tools to tackle a wide ranging project such as this.  Highway Rider presents the listener with a wide variety of musical settings, solo piano, piano trio,trio with orchestra, & trio with orchestra with guest saxophonist Joshua Redman.  Mehldau is working with familiar personal his regular working trio with Larry Grenadier on bass & Jeff Ballard on drums.  Drummer Matt Chamberlin worked on the Largo album returns to add his touch to a few tracks & after a long hiatus Mehldau brought sax man Joshua Redman in on tenor & soprano.  After several hearings I'v come to conclude that this album is a watershed for Mehldau a definite artistic peak.  This music flows in a continuos suite sort of way, each tune picking up where the previous left off & building to the climax of the album which in my opinion is the first track on disc two which happens to be the albums longest piece clocking in at 12 minutes.  My only problem with this album is I wish the tracks especially on disc 1 had been just a bit longer, I feel they could have been developed alittle more but that is just me.  This music falls in line with stuff like Bill Evan's album Symbiosis or Danilo Perez's Across The Crystal Sea but I think this album surpasses those as far as continuity & I like the way Mehldau uses Joshua Redman out in front of the orchestra as a soloist, it's not a sound that is featured very often.  Redman rises to the challenge and his playing for me is a highlight of the album.  I also hear some elements of Chick Corea's writing especially his use of hand claps & voices & foot stomping, this percussive element really enhances the music for me giving it a earthy funky feel which is such a cool contrast alongside the strings.  I highly recommend this album to anyone with a open mind & a appetite for fresh good music.  Enjoy!for me giving it a earthy funky feel which is such a cool contrast alongside the strings.

0743497465|2.0|For those who have already read the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, this book is a severe let down.  This is one of the first books that Dan Brown wrote and it shows.  The story isn't developed nearly as well as the Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons.  Angels and Demons is where the reader can really tell that Dan Brown is becoming a good writer.  Dan Brown wrote the Da Vinci Code after he finished Angels and Demons.  In the Da Vinci Code I think he perfected his craft.  You can see errors that he committed in Angels and Demons that he fixed in the Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />Deception Point is about cryptography, but if you like a story about a subject such as that I would much rather recommend Body of Secrets by James Bamford.  It's a much more interesting read.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Not that there was anything to not like about the \\"bubblegum\\" Madonna of the early/mid 80s, but on this album, Madonna shows a much deeper and more spiritual side of herself that many people probably didn't know was there at the time. \\"Deep, dark and haunting\\" is probably the best way to describe many of the songs on this album, especially \\"Oh Father\\" and \\"Promise To Try.\\" Of course, Madonna doesn't completely abandon what made her famous in the first place, and songs like the title track, \\"Express Yourself,\\" and \\"Cherish\\" show that she was well able to incorporate her new lyrical maturity into the breezy, upbeat pop settings that served her (and us) well so many times before.

Police Department, beautiful mysterious movie look-alikes, a quirky dirt magazine reporter, smart quick dialogue,perfect ensemble, and unexpected traps in every corner.<br /><br />Director Curtis Hanson does a fantastic job showing the two-faces of Los Angeles.  His view of the city and the perfect tone of the dark, exciting story grab you at the start.  The city of dreams is caught as well as the dark side.  The beginning is narrated by Danny DeVito who elaborates on L.A. glamour, sun and fun, ritzy homes and Hollywood celebrities and hopefuls.  Danny plays a reporter for \\"Hush-Hush\\" magazine so he also shows the duplicity of L.A. with its high-class hookers, murders, and corrupt cops.<br /><br />L.A. Confidential shows how hard it is to know who you can trust, who is watching your back or the criminals.  There are three detectives (Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey) who are smart and clever in their own unique ways.  They are investigating a coffee-shop mass murder and as each thread of evidence unravels, they discover more and more corruption in the Police Department.<br /><br />The three detectives use their own unique personalities and tactics to delve into the investigation of a mass murder at a small coffee shop.  The tenor and quality of the movie holds up throughout.  The pacing is quick and the viewer needs to give each scene total attention as the threads of evidence and relationships are tightly and well woven.<br /><br />Kim Basinger is fantastic as the Veronica Lake look-alike prostitute.  She knows how to deliver and it gives the film a integrity that is hard to replicate.<br /><br />All the actors do a top notch job - Basinger, Crowe, Cromwell, DeVito, Strathairn, Spacey, Crowe and Pearce.<br /><br />A standing ovation for the perfect screen version masterpiece mystery!
B002TYZKIM|4.0|Even though it represents the name of the concert tour, the film's title is a bit of a misnomer because it's more accurate to say this could have been it. Nine months after his death, Michael Jackson is unlikely to move anywhere close to obscurity soon. As the first post-mortem tribute to his legacy, this 2009 documentary, filmed at the Staples Center in LA and directed by choreographer Kenny Ortega ([[ASIN:B0000DIXDR Dirty Dancing]]), is testament to an idiosyncratic talent driven by an even more amazing level of dedication made up of equal parts anxiety and intuition. In fact, it is his perfectionism that will remain in your memory more than the quality of his performance here, which was never meant to be in a commercial film. For the most part, he sings half-heartedly in order to save his voice for the real shows, but what we do see is Jackson as the master orchestrator of the concert experience.<br /><br />Throughout the 112-minute running time, Jackson never looks like he's taking any aspect of his performance for granted. Rather, he becomes a rather human presence who knows when the music is off a beat or when a dance move is not quite right. A particularly insightful scene occurs when he stands over the keyboard of the show's musical director and tries to coax a specific note out of him. If Barbra Streisand said \\"I just want to hear it the way I wrote it\\", she would have been accused of diva behavior, but Jackson manages to say it without malice in a way that shows how little it takes for him to make such a demand. There is no doubt who is in charge of the concert, and Ortega often seems to kowtow to Jackson like a personal assistant until the performer's enjoyment on a cherry-picker brings out the watchful parent in the director.<br /><br />Judging from Jackson's clothing, the footage appears to capture him on three separate occasions during the rehearsals, and you can see him rethinking each familiar song with something new like a proposed fiery ending to \\"Beat It\\" a la Jimi Hendrix. Even though some of his performances are ragged, even unpolished, there are key highlights to savor such as Jackson's a capella version of \\"Human Nature\\", a genuinely edgy take on \\"Black or White\\" complete with a sharp guitar solo from Orianthi Panagaris, and the film noir treatment of \\"Smooth Criminal\\" with his fedora-wearing character melding into archival footage of Rita Hayworth ([[ASIN:B00004XPPK Gilda]]) and Humphrey Bogart ([[ASIN:B000FFJYA2 The Big Sleep]]). In fact, several of the numbers come with mini-movies like a Tim Burton-influenced take on \\"Thriller\\" and a bucolic fantasyland for \\"Earth Song\\". Interview snippets featuring musicians, singers, choreographers and costume designers are interspersed throughout.<br /><br />In the end, the film feels like an elaborate home movie of a worshipped performer who refuses to rest on his laurels and instead wants to show his relevance for the next generation. Although painfully thin and with an overly reconstructed face, Jackson doesn't give any indication of his pending death in the footage, and I'm sure that was quite deliberate given his family had approval of the final cut. It's worth seeing for what could have been quite a sensational concert comeback. The 2010 DVD contains six featurettes that focus on various aspects of the production; showcase two of the mini-movies in their entirety, \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\"; and present a post-mortem tribute from those who worked with him in those final weeks.mi Hendrix.

0312370849|3.0|Caution: plot spoilers.                    Sarah's Key includes an afterword with book group questions. The following questions were not included.      Does Julia seem unusually introspective? Does she gaze at her navel or does she live? Does she think of others as persons or as relationships? Why did she pursue Sarah's story beyond the bounds required by a magazine article? Why did Julia try to find Sarah? Do the reasons she gives for these actions seem plausible? Is this something someone would actually do? Should one be sure of the results of one's hands on another's life? Julia ponders the question.     William discovers that his mother - dead now for thirty years - had a tragic past that drove her to suicide. He becomes distraught. His marriage crumbles. It takes William years to accommodate the discovery. Julia brings him this discovery. She decides on an abortion to save her marriage. At the last moment, she decides to keep the child. She realizes this is the right decision. Julia's husband is a cad. Julia's search for Sarah leads her to her to William. They are soul-mates.        One of the questions to Ms. de Rosnay from the afterword is, \\"How did it make you feel?\\" (This with regard to research on the Vel'd'Hiv roundup.) What does the question say about possible attitudes toward self-absorption?

0439023483|5.0|This is the first in a series of books by Suzanne Collins. I was recommended this read by a dear friend and family member. I was so impressed by this read. I haven't been this excited about a series since Twilight. LOL.<br />The Hunger Games is set in North America where there are 12 colonies. There were 13, but they rebelled and are non existent. The main character and protagonist Katniss is a 16 year old girl. She is a illegal hunter in her district, feeding her family in a very poverty stricken district.<br />The Capital is a what we as Americans would call The Man... Or a communist government set up in a place that all their needs are meet while a dying people suffer and try and fend for themselves.<br /><br />There was a rebellion in the colonies between them and the Capital. So, in their peace treaty The Hunger Games where birthed. The Hunger Games is a form of punishment and a way for the Capitol to remind the people that they are in control. Each year at the same time one boy and one girl from all twelve districts are chosen to participate in a yearly competition to the death. It is done by lottery for children ages 12-18.<br /><br />There is also a few love interests in the story. Katniss is torn between her best friend and another companion along her journey's. A romance that always leaves the reading wondering.<br /><br />I hope everyone I know reads this, not just for the excitement in reading such a great story. But, also for us to remember what all we have and how great we have it here in our country right at this moment.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Yes, Sade has done it again! My freinds tease me and refer to Sade as (Sad)e, especially after her last album, but she does it for me every time. She is one of the last artist that speaks true to her emotions, relevant to the time in her life when she makes her recordings. I believe her recordings are a biography of her life. Each album is a snap shot of her life. Her albums are like calling a friend that you have not talked to for a while. When you call the person they may be having the time of their life, or they may be going through some ruff times. Her albums reflect her life. Some  reflect good times, some reflect not so good times. This one, I believe, reflects her emerging from some not so good times. She reflects her maturity, after having been through some personal challenges in her life. For those who are around her age, and I am one of them, we can relate to what she has been through. It is in the music, if you really listen. She reveals a lot of herself in the recent NY Times article, and then you can understand what she has put into this album. So, yeah, I wish this album had more up tempo songs, but that's not where she's at in her life now. Maybe, her next one will reflect more of an up tempo in her life. But that's what I love about Sade, she pours herself into the music, regardless of what others think she should be doing. Her truth is in the music, not into what the pop culture or the record company wants her to do with her music. That is refreshing. So I'll take (Sad)e every time.
B0000AC8LR|1.0|A universe existing along side ours where Frank comes back as a rabbit to warn Donnie Darko that closure of the other world occurs within 28 hours (give or take a few minutes) and will take our universe with it unless Donnie, savior like, uses his supernatural powers (we don't know where they came from or what precisely they are) to stop it before the plane engine kills Donnie in Universe A to stop Universe B from taking us, with the water spout giving more nebulous information, is too much to take.  The subplot involves a pervert.  Let's go make a movie on the seat of our pants.  I have a better plot: a tea cup breaks and the universe is going to end unless the owner of the tea cup can find the superglue within 28 hours.  A puppet which looks like Obama keeps giving the owner of the tea cup grimm warnings which all come to pass.  No matter where the owner of the tea cup hides, this puppet makes its appearance: on the radio, on televion, on nonstop infomercials, and last of all, the toilet.  As it pokes its head out from under the tiolet seat, the out of control puppet continues to torment the owner of the tea cup.  The owner of the tea cup discovers that destroying the teleprompter that the evil puppet is reading from is key to stopping the realization of any more ominous omens.  The story ends with the universe A of the puppet imploding when an airplane engine falls on the puppet as the puppet is giving a speech to an audience of gullible people who live on every word of the mad puppet.

B002VECLVO|5.0|Tom Ford has taken what is arguably a simple story, moved it into a modern connotation while fully realizing its period visually. Mr Isherwood's novelette leaves so many holes that Mr Ford so wonderfully fills. One is like the events took place, and the other is the fairy tale (Grim's) of those events, or how we wish they would have happened given that situation (given our modern concept of love, especially between two men). In the book it is George who decides not to go and see Jim's family in Ohio (not the Colorado family's decision George not go as in the movie); which I somehow find truer to a 40 year old \\"English\\" homosexual in the early 1960's. Its is George that gives up Jim's animals ( a nod to Isherwood's Heinz, and their life in Portugal, whom he lost to Nazi Germany. Though Heinz didn't die actually, he did get sucked into the war machine and was lost to Christopher) unlike the dog's mentioned in Ford's film. However, it is these moments ... the phone call between George and the family, the loss of the dogs... George's comment to Charley ( Moore) about his love being more real than anything she has ever known.. that take the film to a new level about gay men, and gay men in love, that, had Isherwood's George been in a fuller understanding of himself in 1962, he would have been likely to feel, how he should have reacted to the loss of Jim. There is a scene in the movie in a parking lot where George runs into a dog, the same breed as his own lost pair in Jim's accident, that could  have been so cheesy and sentimental, and yet Ford's understanding of  complex relationships between hope, loss, need, connection, is so wonderfully prefect, and well organized that instead of schlock one is moved. Anyone gay or straight, who has lost, ended without contact, removed oneself from a relationship in a finial complete manor before they were ready, when it is a shock... understands these moments Ford so perfectly organizes. The use of color, the use of camera, the ticking clocks, all of these weave a tapestry of emotion evoking the senses... And then add to it Ford's innate understanding of the period visually, make for a wonderful, Beautiful, moving tale of love, loss, connection, Isolation, and the finite reality of life.ing clocks, all of these weave a tapestry of emotion evoking the senses...

The songs are extremely well written, and show us that the KISS machine was rolling along just fine at the time of its recording. It also shows the band writing more complex music than just the first three albums. You can't always stay in the same musical style that got you \\"into the business\\". Don't get me wrong, I treasure each of those for the \\"intro\\" to KISS. But getting back to \\"THE ELDER\\", it is the album that actually gave the KISS listeners something to think about.

0375704027|4.0|Norwegian Wood is completely different from Murakami's other books. It is a straightforward story of a young man's coming-of-age and his relationships with two main women and two others who are secondary yet also important. There is nothing of Murakami's trademark surrealism and paranormal in this book. In an afterword from the author, he tells how there was an uproar in Japan when this book came out. People felt betrayed by it, accusing him of abandoning his unique personal style for commercialism. But Murakami says that he wrote the book as an challenge to himself, to prove that he could write in a realistic style as well.    And he does succeed at that, although I did miss the creativity of his usual style. As the title suggests, the story takes place in the 1960's when the Beatles were at the height of their popularity. Toru, the main character, is a university student in Tokyo. It was a time of unrest and student takeovers of campus buildings in Japan as well as in America (which surprised me - I had thought that the student rebellions of the 60's were due to the Vietnam War which Japan was not involved in.) Although student unrest is always included in descriptions of the book, I felt that it didn't really play a large part in it.    Toru is a quiet young man, mostly a loner. He is closely involved with two women - almost-girlfriends - and loves all four of the women in different ways. But with each of them, there are obstacles and he never really gets a true intimate partnership going with any of them. Two of the women are mentally ill (he meets one as the roommate of the other in their mental hospital.) The mental illness is an interesting aspect of the novel, but it is very vague. Except for the suicide attempts of one woman, they didn't come across as mentally ill to me. The suicidal one was somewhat detached and depressed, but within normal range, and her depression seemed to be a normal response to grief rather than clinical depression. Also, the mentalinstitution was really more of a utopian community than a hospital or institution. I felt that these were women who preferred to withdraw from the world to live a serene life of contemplation, rather than patients suffering from mental illnesses. Perhaps in another place and time they would have been cloistered nuns.    I admired the respect, and even tenderness, that the author showed in his treatment of one the of women who was much older than Toru. She was portrayed as equally desirable and worthy of being loved by a young man, as the young girls. Beautiful . . . and something you never see in Western literature.    Norwegian Wood is a quietly wise and deep novel about the subtle nuances of relationships and how complicated - perhaps impossible - even the simplest and most fundamental relationship between a man and a woman can be.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I have been anticipating the showing of the Life series on the Discovery channel for the past few weeks, but after watching the first two installments tonight I was more than disappointed. Oprah is a terrible narrator. The editing is very poorly done, and even the soundtrack was not fitting. I didn't learn anything new with Oprah narrating - she lacks the passion and knowledge of David Attenborough.     I will definitely be going with the David Attenborough version of the series - from the few clips I've seen, it appears to be an entirely different show. The footage is basically the same, but there are HUGE differences in editing that really impact the way the story is told. And Attenborough has a gift for bringing excitement and life into whatever he is narrating.    This version of the series is actually quite Lifeless.

0316017922|4.0|In typical Gladwell fashion, this well-researched book explores many factors that make people successful... or not. Sure, talent helps. Hard work helps (10,000 hours of something to excel at it). But there are plenty of other convenient factors - some in people's control but many of them purely fortuitous - that can make the difference.<br /><br />I have always been big on the idea of meritocracy... and still am to a large part. However, Outliers really makes you realize that there can be more. As an adult I now look back on the circumstances that may have helped me get to where I am (for better or worse). As a parent, I now look at the circumstances that I am surrounding my own children with. Read the book and you will understand why.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Clean. Transparent. Natural. Touching. Breathing. These are adjectives that I would choose (if asked) to describe this incredible score.<br /><br />Lord of the Rings was undoubtedly a commercial movie. A blockbuster, yes. Yet somehow, deep inside it touched every single person who saw it. Even if they don't know it themselves, it did. I'm sure of it. Partly because of all the subtleties of Tolkien's vision. Partly because of the simplicity (and yet the unfathomable complexity) of the plot and interpersonal relationships between the main characters. Partly because of Howard Shore's music. For me personally this latter part is among the things that I love the most about Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Yes, it is a Hollywood-type score. It's dramatic; it's bombastic; and at times tear-jerking. Yet, like the film itself, it is also sincere. And that (for me) is what makes it stand apart from other scores of the same league. The music lives and breathes. What is more, I see some parallels between Shore's organic score and Tolkien's perception of a tree. Both feel old and timeless. Both grow. Both feel alive.<br /><br />The music itself is shrouded in mist. Yes, that is the feeling I get. And through the mist here and there like trees in a forest simple yet poignant melodies show their pale faces. Be it a soulful whistle or a noble cello, they all paint extraordinarily beautiful pictures in water-colors. From the sad monologue of the string section on Amon Hen to the yearning mood of Breaking of the Fellowship to the tranquil quasi-silence of Enya's May It Be, we can see a tree growing before our eyes.<br /><br />I truly believe that this is one of the masterpieces of modern music. With the current minimalist trends in popular and film music Howard Shore's work stands on its own ground borrowing from both yet bringing so much more to the otherwise stagnant genre.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I've read hundreds of reviews from a wide diversity of people.  And for the majority of detractors, I think they have limited imagination.  This film is great, I enjoyed it immensely!    I saw many clips and trailers, read critical reviews that chopped Avatar to pieces and sneered at its creator and people who generally enjoyed it; all before I went to cinema to see it myself.  Yet, I saw in two trailers what many harsh critics fail to even mention.  And what I saw stirred excitement to see this film, to experience it myself.  So, I went, I saw, I laughed, I felt anger, I shed tears and I felt joy.  My disbelief suspended, I was carried away by this story as much as any good book can do.  And that's unusual for a film to manage.  That one neglected thing is the emotional impact the acting has.  The visual and audio experience is stunningly beautiful. The acting IMO is superb.  The story is simple, easy to get along with, doesn't jump around with plot twists and normal story devices many film makers and authors use.  It doesn't need them.  Some will naturally pick up on and hold political issues they feel they see.  They are simply story elements, carrying a 'normal load', without intent to make political statements.  There are two stories being told here.  Really, one is Jake and Ney'Tiri's relationship.  The other is the technical wizardry involved in making this film FEEL real and natural.  The relatively simple storyline is still filled with action, adventure and emotion.  And that emotion comes across in so fluid a way you believe it.  The second real story is what you do not see that is actually what brings the performances out so very well.  A method of motion capture that allows real time LIVE playback of ALL performances, live actor and 3D CG, just as it would appear in the film.  The director and actors could all see exactly what their performances were, even while actually performing.  \\"Instant Feedback\\" is what we call this.  And clearly, its a help for everyone involved.  YES, I thoroughly enjoyed the film in cinema, I will go enjoy it again in cinema, and I will buy the film on DVD as soon as it's out.  And I will gladly watch it again and again and again!  I do highly recommend seeing Avatar at the cinema, even in 2D it is stunning.  And frankly I feel sad for those who seem unable to immerse themselves in this story and film.  I think they missed out on something very special.    Michael  \\"McGrandpa\\"

0385528752|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read on both individual self-improvement and organizational change.  Any person who is attempting to implement major structural improvements and changes to their organization, either small or large, should read this book.  A very important contribution to the field, and very easy to read.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Get out the kleenexs, this is a certain weepy for any one who likes dogs, moving stories or a well-made movie. This is the story of a man and his dog and the bond that the two of them created.<br /><br />Richard Gere is well, Richard Gere. He comes off very well in this film but the main star is the dog Hachi.<br /><br />It is simply a nice tale of devotion, loyalty and love.

B000XTLUW0|5.0|Although I've never been that impressed with MUSE's studio recordings, I was blown away by the live music video included in the special features section of the Twilight DVD.  Was this the same song, the same band I've been hearing endlessly on local radio stations?  Not to me.  This live recording made me want to seek out a DVD of the entire performance and led me to acquire H.A.A.R.P., a beautifully performed, filmed and edited capture of what must have been the show of a lifetime for those lucky enough to witness one of these two-night Wembley performances first hand.  Intense histrionics of guitar, voice, classical and electric piano.  MB, please save some talent for the rest of the world.  You have too much.
B00006JJ51|3.0|All the criticisms made by the 'kid's review' dude are valid. Using the 'plausible deniability' of a so-called 'work of art,' these guys confess to murders on these raps, and not only that, they brag about it. They also express a willingness to force themselves on women (and men, they call them the punk mfs in prison lingo), steal the property of and shoot and kill anyone they want with very little justification (they do play the race card often but they certainly do not consider themselves 'victims' in any way, except to a certain extent, former victims to police brutality who are victims no more), especially Police.<br /><br />I can't imagine how many middle-class folks of all colors in the suburbs dumped in their pants and bought extra guns and ammo when they first heard this. I'm one of those guys. Here was the ultimate blaxploitation in its rawest form. But this wasn't a joke and these guys weren't Shaft or Superfly. These aren't actors here acting a part in \\"Goodfellas from the Ghetto,\\"  based on real events, these are the actual gangsters themselves (well, at least 2 or 3 of them for sure), glorifying violence,  bragging about being completely ruthless, Ill-tempered, backstabbing, merciless jerks with no honor whatsoever. This album and hundreds of gangsta rap albums after it, cannot be morally justified in their lyrical content. Even Chris Rock admitted this. They certainly do more harm than good in society at large, in the short and long term, when art that imitated life is imitated in turn by life again and so on and son, the cycle continues.<br /><br />More people got murdered in the inner-cities pursuing the ruthless, macho ideal glorified on this record and its legion of imitators, more blacks than ever ended-up in the prison system and more middle-class whites lost their manners and minds and got in trouble also, went to prison and experienced rectal discomfort. And yet, despite all this, despite being an immoral work,  glorifying a harmul and degenerate attitude no decent or respectable person would or should imitate, it remains a work of art, a very powerful and skillfully constructed and performed, raw work of explosive and poisonous-as-an overdose-of-China-white-Heroin-if mishandled poetry , and hence, its undeniable power to influence. This is the glaring paradox which is the fascination of all 'gangsta rap,' the reason why this genre of rap remained popular while the others faded away.  Most people will not analyze it but nevertheless sense this.  How can elements that are harmful create a thing of ferocious and ruthless beauty?  How did the synthesis occur?<br /><br />Should S.O.O.Compton be officially censored because it does more harm than good when many so-called adults subconsciously take in its message and act on it to alter their behavior for the worse, like children would? Absolutely not.  All works of art are pieces of a vast puzzle that illuminate different aspects of the human condition and this is just one piece. Those who see the one piece as the whole puzzle are the problem. What is needed are intelligent consumers who can understand, criticize and discern the many elements presented by a complex work and put it into context, rather than just accepting it wholesale as 'good' on a gut level. Works of art made by mass-murderers (Churchill), killers (Phil Spector), prostitutes (Judee Sill, Xaviera Hollander, Janis Joplin, Madonna, Billie Holiday), Thieves (Jean Genet) rapists (Polanski), pederasts (Proust, William Burroughs, Andre Gide, Allen Ginsberg), pimps (Iceberg Slim, Miles Davis), thieves/drug addicts (Chet Baker, Art Pepper and hundreds of others) and charlatans (that idiot on Oprah, Carlos Castaneda) all remain valid if they satisfy the main criterion of art which is an ability to communicate something new and fascinating about the human condition on a transcendent level, however wretched and low-life that condition.<br /><br />The ruthless feelings of Ice Cube expressed in the lyrics ofNWA are present in much less extreme form in most human beings or else how would they recognize it? No matter how much of a low-life Ice Cube is, he did what few people will ever accomplish in their lives, he created a genuine if dangerous work of art. Machiavelli expresses some of the same feelings and strategies in a much more refined but not necessarily more communicative way.  Machiavelli in the wrong hands is also very dangerous. Pascal has a saying \\"Man's greatness is so obvious, it can be proven even by his wretchedness.\\"  If \\"Straight Out of Compton\\" had no artistic merit then it would not be dangerous and no one would worry about it or be interested in it for very long. It would not spawn hundreds of imitators which the social engineers puppeteering behind the scenes, working for the five giant companies that own all media, very cynically and deliberately used, along with desensitizing violent video games and movies to condition the already systematically dumbed-down masses, both black and white, inner city and suburbs, for the worse.<br /><br />The social engineers realized that albums like \\"Straight Out of Compton\\" cause 'moral confusion' among people who are exposed to it for an extended period of time and then due to a lack of discernment and stupidity, they experience 'cognitive dissonance\\" and a resulting subconscious equating of 'good art' with 'good morals,' (even if consciously they realize, hey, what these guys are advocating is pretty obscene and wrong even under the extreme circumstances of war and ghetto life gangland warfare).  Loosening of morals, and freedom from morals is then sensed as an opportunity for a lazier, 'better' way of existing.  In other words, if the art is good and true and has ferocious beauty and strength, then the morals that go with it must be pretty valid too or beneficial to adopt or else how did these morals, however twisted and ruthless, manage to create the true art when other methods by Nickelback and L.L. Cool J failed?  This subconscious equating of the artistic with the moral is gradually exploited to the point where  like Pavlov's dog, the mouths of the masses start to water with the potential meat of \\"loosening of morals' at every ringing of the bell of anything 'gangsta rap' while the art (meat) has long been replaced with nothing, or mountains of completely or mostly harmful product with no redeeming value.<br /><br />Nabokov said that creating a work of art is like composing riddles with elegant solutions. Once the elegant solution is found, the work transcends and remains valid and strong despite any other potentially harmful aspects such as unsympathetic, perverted characters.  Well, that's what NWA did on this album, they somehow found a most vulgarly elegant and most direct solution to the riddle of how to express \\"the strength of street knowledge.\\" They were not the first to do so, Iceberg Slim, Jim Carroll, Jean Genet, Edward Bunker and many others came before them. But they were one of the first to prove that 'vulgar elegance,' a seeming contradiction in terms, can be made to exist through art based on their life experience.ss extreme form in most human beings or else how would they recognize it?

B000086EOB|5.0|I love The Last Command.  It is one of the best W.A.S.P. CDs along with The Headless Children.

I own A Hard Day's Night and Magical Mystery Tour, and I paid less than 10 bucks each for those. Coincidentally, I saw Help last night on TCM, and while the song segments are great for Beatle fans like me, the movie itself is a rambling and ridiculous disapointment. what were they thinking...or smoking, rather. I will wait for a better price on Help and hope that the added features will be worthwhile.
B002YIHO7I|3.0|Sade has been around for 25 years- starting with 1984's \\"Diamond Life\\". Although she has a quarter century under her belt, her musical output is sporadic at best. If you don't count the greatest hits album in 1994 and the live album in 2002, she has only done six studio albums. Because of the time lapses in recorded output, numerous Sade clones have emerged over the years- the most obvious being Esthero, Dido and Corrine Bailey Rae.<br /><br />In 2010, Sade returns with \\"Soldier Of Love\\", her first album in a decade. The album starts off with the ballad \\"The Moon And The Sky\\" and later leading into the title track. \\"Babyfather\\" features background vocals from Sade's daughter, Ila Adu. Even Sade longtime video director Sophie Muller appears on a couple of songs as well. What this new album suffers from is boring ballads, which is ironic considering that is Sade's trademark. It's a decent record, but one would have thought that she would have done something better regarding the time she's spent away from music.
0385523904|5.0|Nothing to Envy is a spellbinding and detailed account of daily life now and during the worst of the famine in North Korea.  It is so well sourced and the facts so well cross referenced that the reader gains confidence in the truthfullness and accuracy of the eye witness accounts.  As the horror unfolds as told by eye witnesses, the reader is captivated by the intricately woven accounts translated and told in a thoroughly readable and fascinating manner. A \\"must read\\" for those interested in the world outside the USA.

B000Q7ZND6|5.0|Not a bad movie, a bit confusing towards the end, very nicely done graphics, acting is good.  The story line has some detective suspense effect in it, some horror and scary moments.
B002Q9MZF6|3.0|The voices are beautiful, the actors play their roles well, but I am not a fan of film vs. stage in Opera.  I was disappointed.  Film makers think they must add to the work with comlicated scenes, lots of \\"extras\\" and it's simply not necessary.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Good news, I checked with BBC. The version that says narrated by David Attenborough is in fact narrated by David Attenborough and if you like Oprah that version will be available as well. It is not a misprint on Amazon and apparently the person at Discovery was mistaken when she told the other reviewer that you could only purchase one narrated by Oprah
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Books and movies have different strengths and weaknesses. What works in one medium may very well not work in another. The pacing is also different - books can read at the pace of the reader; movies are watched in one sitting.<br /><br />I have read the book but it was five years ago when it came out. Frankly, I wouldn't be the best person to ask how well the movie follows the book. I do think the movie captures the essence of the book quite well. The major themes of the book seem to all be there. I think it's only fair to judge the movie by how well it succeeds as a movie.<br /><br />The movie (like the book) has the difficult task of setting up the grand finale while being entertaining in its own right. This it does brilliantly. New cast member Jim Broadbent is outstanding as the inherently decent but weak Horace Slughorn. The returning cast are also at the top of their game. Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy really shines here. He plays the anguished and conflicted Draco Malfoy for all it's worth. Draco seems to be a lot more sympathetic here than in the book. This is no doubt the filmmaker's intention; we'll have to wait to see how this plays out. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore is also great. The \\"three\\" effortlessly handle their roles. Radcliffe and Grint are especially good when \\"under the influence\\".<br /><br />The only reservation I have about recommending this movie is that the previous five installments should be watched to get the full impact of the film. Otherwise only the Harry Potter fans who can't tolerate any alterations and/or omissions from the book have any issues with this fine film.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|It was by chance that I discovered John Adams (HBO Miniseries) during a Google search for something unrelated to American history. Well, thanks to Google's not-so-perfect search algorithms, I got the chance to view this poignant portrayal of one of our founding fathers and the second president of the United States.<br /><br />I must admit, with some reservation and shame, that I know very little of this man, because I am a product of my generation, which is one of ignorance and complacency. Though this miniseries did inform and entertain, I'm not sure where fact ends and creative license begins. However, I take some small comfort in the hope that Mr. McCullough's input, if he had any input at all, steered HBO's writers on the path of historical accuracy.<br /><br />As for the acting, kudos to Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney, and Stephen Dillane for their amazing acting performances. I don't think they could've done a finer job, especially Giamatti, who I never liked for some reason, but now I have a new-found respect for him. I don't think he's ever done a part that has challenged him as much as John Adams has. I guess he just needed to be given the chance to shine. Good for him.<br /><br />Now I'm off to read David McCullough's bestselling biography so I can be sure I fill those gaps in my knowledge concerning Mr. Adams' political career. Now that I think about it, I should've read the biography before watching the series. Regardless, better late than never.
B00005QBUK|5.0|I have used many different sets of headphones over the years but this is by far the best sound for the dollar. I have 5 sets and all still work perfectly after years of use. All still sound good and remain comfortable to wear. There are expensive headphones that sound better but, not proportionally to cost and none of them are as comfortable as the Sony.
0201633612|5.0|The other books on patterns I've read (Head First, Design Patterns Explained, Applying UML and Patterns) and articles around the net are just quoting this book and trying to introduce new examples with varying success. But the examples in this book are better and first-hand. The other ones are like \\"this guy said that this guy said that the bridge pattern is like this because other guy said they read it on Design Patterns: Elements of...\\" At first you may have misgivings about reading an old book, but the newer ones aren't just any better; they are just rehashes of the old one, so they are as much in fault. If you find the book unclear, you're not going to find any better elsewhere.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Plot/Storyline: 4 3/4 Stars<br /><br />Reminiscent of Stephen King's The Running Man,this was an incredibly fast-paced book that held my attention throughout the entire thing. Even though I wanted to find out what happened at the end, I didn't actually want it to end.<br /><br />The world created by Ms. Collins was rich with imagination and just the right amount of detail. Readers weren't bogged down with having to learn and memorize a new history of the world. Instead, small portions were delivered a little at a time within the story.<br /><br />The action, while horrifying at times, still remained on the subtle side of goriness. There was a little bit of blood and guts, but it was definitely handled tastefully and not just thrown in for shock value.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed by the ending as it was almost one of those \\"I'm going to force you to buy the sequel\\" endings. I say \\"almost\\" because this book did have an ending and a resolution of the greater portion of the plot. So, it was definitely okay as a stand alone.<br /><br />Character Development: 4 Stars<br /><br />Katniss seemed a little too naive, even for a teenager. I would have thought that a teen growing up in such poverty would be a little more `people saavy'. Also, at sixteen, I would think that hormones would take over at least a little; however, she is completely oblivious to not only Peeta, but any male.<br /><br />Writing Style: 4 Stars<br /><br />Ms. Collins chose to write her novel in present tense. In my reading experience, I have found that this is one of the hardest tenses for an author to write in. While most of the time, the tense was appropriate and made for great storytelling, there were errors where the wrong tense was used.<br /><br />The descriptions were excellent. I was happily surprised at the common language used in the dialogue. So many authors who write about `alternate futures,' force readers to learn a whole new language while trying to enjoy a story. Ms. Collins only throws in a few new words here and there, and those were easily pronounced, making for smooth reading.<br /><br />Editing/Formatting: 4 3/4 Stars<br /><br />There were some changes in font with the letters going from big to small and back again that made for some distraction. It didn't happen often, though.<br /><br />The editing was of professional quality.<br /><br />Rating: PG-14 for Violencenced, making for smooth reading.    Editing/Formatting: 4 3/4 Stars    There were some changes in font with the letters going from big to small and back again that made for some distraction. It didn't happen often, though.

0743298039|4.0|One day when I was browsing the New York Times Bestseller list I came upon this book. The book had many five star reviews and much praise, so I put it on my wishlist. A couple weeks later my mothers birthday was nearing so I opened up my wishlist to look for a book that I could give to her. This book caught my eye I hurried over to Barnes and Noble and purchased it, along with a few others. I set this book on my coffee table and every day I was tempted to pick it up and read it, well my temptation got the best of me and I started to read the book. Mind you I had done a lot of research on this book before I bought it. I read amazon reviews, barnes and noble reviews, New York Times reviews, and many others; therefore I was a bit surprised when I came across a couple sexual parts. I don't really mind reading a little of that, but my mother is a little more conservative. I wish someone would have mentioned this in their review. As I continued reading the book I kept wondering why those sexual parts were even included in the book, it wasn't until the very last chapters that it all comes together. Other than that, I loved the book. At the end of every chapter I had to continue on to find out more. I had to force myself to put the book down at night so I could get some sleep. I would highly recommend this book.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|If even half of what Michael Moore presents is even half-true, our politicians and their controllers in the insurance & healthcare industries should be indighted for aggravated assault, abandonment, inflicting intentional harm, psychological and physical abuse, homicide, you name it!<br /><br />That Americans continue to swallow the lies & mistruths spewed by corporate profiteers and government mouthpieces while European and other nations provide their citizens universal healthcare as a basic human right is astonishing.<br />If Mr Moore does take some liberties in making his point, they can be nowhere near the lies liberties taken by insurance and pharmaceutical companies who have gouged us for years with unwavering focus on their bottom-line.

B002XTBEDI|5.0|I loved Cranford, and the only complaint I have with Return to Cranford is that it is too short!  I hope there will be more to come!     This is one of my husband's favorite period pieces, along with The Inheritance, Jane Eyre, and Mansfield Park.  We both love most of the period pieces we've purchased, to be honest, but Cranford and Return to Cranford is at the top! Great story lines and well-cast!
B002VECM4A|5.0|The charming Gabourey Sidibe delivers an inspired and uplifting performance in her first film role as the lead in the much discussed \\"Precious\\". The role celebrates the formidable inner strength of character within Precious allowing her to survive the daily avalanche of brutal abuse by her chillingly damaged,rabid-pit-bull of a mother. A mother who makes Mommie Dearest look like Mother Teresa...  Miss Sidibe,if anyone, deserved the 2010 Oscar for best actress...perhaps...perhaps for daring to upstage Mo'Nique's camp performance with subtle, understated mesmerizing acting!  Mr.John Waters' should write a potty-mouthed film just for Mo'Nique,full of ironic venom. Revisiting his  tawdry roots could be very funny and BRILLIANT!   The sophisticated cinematography, editing and juxtapositioning of fantasy sequences in the midst of scenes of horrific child abuse makes the film actually bearable to watch. The raw reality of poverty, lack of education, denial and escapism is presented unflinchingly....and believably.Just don't expect the genteel world of \\"Architectural Digest\\".LOL.  Mo'Nique's one-note performance as the mother, unfortunately, sounds like much of her tedious and tired stand up comedy routines where unrelenting profanity and hostility takes center rage...I mean stage. \\"Liberating\\":maybe...mind-numbing:most definitely!  The BIG question is, will the unstoppable Miss Mo' ever be allowed to speak without harsh expletives in her professional work?  As a much, much welcome relief,the classically beautiful, elegant and sensitive Paula Patton plays the kind hearted Special-Ed teacher, Miss Rain (a traditionally feminine lesbian) very effectively....and in doing so, provides the much needed support, shelter, affection and encouragement that Precious is starving for...and pushes her to take charge and rise above her hopelessly desperate circumstances.
B000NHG7BQ|5.0|I had seen this movie many years ago and remembered thinking it was wonderful and heartbreaking at the same time. It did not disapoint.    CJ
B000B8QG22|5.0|Beware the Spoilers.<br /><br />\\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\" is a wonderful movie. From start to finish, you never doubt that it is set in 1965 Saigon, with the Vietnam War not yet at the pitch it reached with the 1968 Tet Offensive, but definitely heading in that direction. The unconventional, hopelessly unmilitary Airman Adrian Cronauer, fresh out of Crete \\"With women that look like Zorba\\", gets off an airliner and is greeted by the seemingly perpetually-happy PFC Eddie Garlick, who never stops calling Cronaeur \\"Sir\\" even though the Air Force radio DJ has no rank whatsoever. Assigned to AFRS- Armed Forces Radio Saigon- Cronauer rides in a M151 MUTT through Saigon's crowded streets. The ride is entertaining even before it begins: PFC Garlick forgets the MUTT is already running and tries to start it, causing it to emit a noise everyone, car fan or not, will surely dread. Airman Cronauer meets one of his soon-to-be-coworkers at AFRS over the radio before he meets him in person. Dan \\"The Man\\" Levitan, a friendly but appallingly bland radio jockey, rambles on as Garlick drives. A dismayed Cronauer remarks, \\"That guy's as boring as whale ****.\\" It is an act of true kindness on Cronauer's part that he never tells Levitan this in person. We soon meet the rest of the AFRS staff, some of whom are enthusiastic, others indifferent, and still others hostile to Airman Cronauer's arrival. Chief among the last bunch is Sergeant Major \\"Where is this man's paperwork?\\" Dickerson, who was allegedly shot in the *** while on a combat patrol. Dickerson hates Cronauer with increasing passion and outright glee as the film goes on, despising his politics and finding nothing funny about anything he says. The station censors, two unnnamed twin sergeants played by Don R. and Don E. Stanton, are the indifferent crowd. All each of them says in greeting to Cronauer is a nod, a blank look, and eventually, \\"Hiya.\\" I found one of Cronauer's remarks about their jobs quite funny- \\"Oh, yes! Censor, censor, censor! Join the Army and mark things!\\" Soon, we find Cronauer going on air for the first time. There is a moment of uncertain silence. We in the audience are uncertain, the listeners, the staff, even Cronauer himself seem unsure of what will happen next. Then he cuts loose with a joyous cry of \\"Gooooooood morning, Vietnam!\\" and nothing is ever the same again.<br /><br />Airman Cronauer is hated by the bureaucrats and loved by the soldiers for the same reason- his manner is totally unconventional, entirely unpredictable, and he starts a wonderful tradition of busting the bureaucracy's rules by tossing the bland music selections aside and blasting across the airwaves with modern rock and roll. The first song he hits us with is the magnificent \\"Nowhere To Run\\" by Martha Reeves & The Vandellas. Yes! Going off the air, Cronauer spots one of the pretty Vietnamese girls he saw on his ride to the station earlier. He buys a bike with metal wheels and chases her across Saigon, leaving the hapless and distressed PFC Garlick to attempt to keep up. Seeing her go into an English class, Cronauer wonders what he can do to meet her. Garlick insists there is nothing that will work, that the cultural differences between Americans and Vietnamese are simply too much. But being the happy-go-lucky soul he is, Cronauer goes for it anyway. But what does he do? He walks into the class and buys it from the Army sergeant already teaching. His equally unconventional and hilarious way of teaching the class provides some of the greatest scenes in the movie. His first conversation with the class is this- \\"First thing I'd like to know is, what subject this is.\\" A kindly middle-aged Vietnamese woman puts her hand up. \\"Is it English?\\" \\"Yes it is, thank you so much for playing!\\" It is after the class that we are introduced to Trinh and her brother, Tuan. The relationship he attempts to create with Trinh, and the friendship he does create with Tuan, are immensely influential in deciding the outcome of his tour in Saigon.<br />This movie is hilarious- just about knocked me dead when I first saw it. But there is far more depth to it than if it were simply a comedy. It has very sad and thought-provoking moments as well as happy ones, and does not shy away from the senseless horrors of war. More and more, it appears that Vietnam is a world gone mad, and that the insane folks are the ones who make the rules.<br /><br />The degree to which SGM Dickerson loathes Airman Cronauer becomes apparent later on, when he has Cronauer kicked off the air after he violates regulations and reports on a bombing at Jimmy Wah's bar. Cronauer yells that Dickerson just wants everyone to think everything is fine in Vietnam when the opposite is true, and that the war is a couple of blocks away at most. Dickerson bellows that it is none of his blankety-blank business and replaces him with the horribly bland LT Steven Hauk. Cronauer is soon back on the air, to the tune of thousands of letters and calls from furious and bewildered GI's, who cannot stand to hear Hauk's awful comedy routine and the polka music he insists on choosing over rock and roll. The scene in which Hauk is fired as a radio DJ is one of the most significant in the movie, and has a surprisingly touching line from Hauk. Deeply hurt by Brigadier General Taylor's declaration that Cronauer is better at comedy than he is and *will* be reinstated, LT Hauk salutes and says, \\"Sir, in my heart I know I'm funny.\\" Dickerson, still carrying on his vendetta against Cronauer, vows \\"This is not over yet.\\" as he leaves. Dickerson sends Cronauer and Garlick into an area he knows is VC-controlled, hoping to get them killed, and only the intervention of Tuan prevents this. But even then it's not over- upon his return to AFRS studios, Cronauer meets with a gloating, triumphant SGM Dickerson, who gleefully informs Cronauer that he is gone. The reason? Tuan is not who he claims. He is a VC terrorist, responsible for many bombings in Saigon, including Jimmy Wah's. He was able to rescue Cronauer and Garlick because the guys hunting them were his friends. Dickerson has Cronauer beaten at last, but even then the Airman has the last laugh- he delivers one of the funniest lines I've ever heard in farewell to the good Sergeant Major, and as Dickerson pursues he is stopped by General Taylor. Why? Taylor, who has always loved Cronauer and is deeply sorry to see him leave, though mercifully with an honorable discharge, has at last had enough of Dickerson's unrelenting seriousness and hostility, and informs him that he, too is gone- SGM Dickerson, who had once boasted of his talent at sending people he hates to places they never even knew the Army had personnel in, is going to Guam.<br /><br />Cronauer's confrontation with 'Tuan', his final softball game with his English class, and the goodbye he and Trinh give one another are beautiful.

Garlick readily acknowledges that playing the broadcast could get him in trouble. Having learned from Cronauer and become increasingly bold and outgoing through the course of the film, he says that Trouble is now his new middle name.<br /><br />\\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\" is everything it promises and so much more- it makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you think about many things, and in the end, if you appreciate the movie as I did, you will walk away loving it.

Seeing how the former VP is such a VIP, shouldn't we keep the PC on the QT, 'cause if it leaks to the VC, he could end up an MIA and then we'd all be put on KP.\\" Genius.aigon.  This movie is hilarious- just about knocked me dead when I first saw it. But there is far more depth to it than if it were simply a comedy. It has very sad and thought-provoking moments as well as happy ones, and does not shy away from the senseless horrors of war. More and more, it appears that Vietnam is a world gone mad, and that the insane folks are the ones who make the rules.     The degree to which SGM Dickerson loathes Airman Cronauer becomes apparent later on, when he has Cronauer kicked off the air after he violates regulations and reports on a bombing at Jimmy Wah's bar. Cronauer yells that Dickerson just wants everyone to think everything is fine in Vietnam when the opposite is true, and that the war is a couple of blocks away at most. Dickerson bellows that it is none of his blankety-blank business and replaces him with the horribly bland LT Steven Hauk. Cronauer is soon back on the air, to the tune of thousands of letters and calls from furious and bewildered GI's, who cannot stand to hear Hauk's awful comedy routine and the polka music he insists on choosing over rock and roll. The scene in which Hauk is fired as a radio DJ is one of the most significant in the movie, and has a surprisingly touching line from Hauk. Deeply hurt by Brigadier General Taylor's declaration that Cronauer is better at comedy than he is and *will* be reinstated, LT Hauk salutes and says, \\"Sir, in my heart I know I'm funny.\\" Dickerson, still carrying on his vendetta against Cronauer, vows \\"This is not over yet.\\" as he leaves. Dickerson sends Cronauer and Garlick into an area he knows is VC-controlled, hoping to get them killed, and only the intervention of Tuan prevents this. But even then it's not over- upon his return to AFRS studios, Cronauer meets with a gloating, triumphant SGM Dickerson, who gleefully informs Cronauer that he is gone. The reason?

B0030Y11XS|4.0|This is a very humane, well-crafted documentary on the effect of predatory capitalism.  While people may argue over whether or not the title is accurate or whether corporatism and not capitalism is to blame, Moore does an excellent job exposing how rigged the system is.  For those who find this documentary compelling and want to go down the rabbit hole even further, any of Alex Jones' more recent documentaries would be a great place to start.  Moore hasn't quite come around to transcending the left-right paradigm that the Powers that Be use to keep people distracted, but he comes very close.  There are a few things Moore could have explored in more detail. For example, Moore didn't address the issue of corporations versus charters.  He didn't tackle treating corporations as persons, nor did he attack usury, what may be the single most important element in the whole system.  While it's nice to see Moore embrace his Catholicism, too bad he apparently hasn't read Chesteron or Belloc on distributivism -- it may have given him more food for thought.
1423101472|5.0|The Last Olympian   Rick Riordan  Book Review    The Last Olympian is about the battle between the demigods and Kronos's army for Olympus. If you haven't read this series, a demigod is a half god half mortal child, a child born of a god and a human, and Kronos is the strongest titan who got cut up by the olympians and thrown into the pits of tartarus and is trying to get revenge. Percy, the son of Poseidon and Beckendorf from the Hephaestus cabin boarded the princess Andromeda, the Titan lord Kronos's ship, armed with explosives and blew up the ship. Percy escapes the ship just before Beckendorf set off the explosives, but Beckendorf didn't get so lucky. Percy finally gets to visit his dad's underwater kingdom (not in the way he thought he was going to visit it) and comes to see it being turned into an underwater battle ground against the ocean Titan Oceanus's army. Percy went into the underworld with Nico, the son of Hades, and bathed in the River Styx to become invincible when fighting Kronos. Kronos's army walked towards New York and Olympus with an army that had a ratio of about twenty monsters and brainwashed demigods to two Camp Half Blood campers and Artemis's hunters. All while this is going on, Kronos made a distraction for the gods, a monster that lived in a volcano until Percy stirred it from its sleep. Percy has to find the hero and stop Kronos before he destroys Olympus and the world!   I absolutely loved this book. It was written just as good, if not better, that the other books in the series. The author Rick Riordan used a ton of details to make it feel like you are in the story, witnessing what is happening. I could never put this book down! He didn't just write things like Percy hopped onto the scooter and headed towards the harbor. He would write it more like Percy hopped onto the silver moped and zipped off towards the New York Harbor. He also added some humor in the book, to keep things funny like when everyone crammed into the empire state building's elevator to catch Kronos. It was a really suspenseful moment, but the mood was sort of lightened when the elevator music came on. It was speechless piano versions of real music on the radio!  It's also funny how he has the Greek gods represented. They all have a more nowadays type of look, not some toga wearing people.   On a scale of one to ten, I would give this book a perfect ten. The book was a perfect balance between the mortal and immortal worlds, funny and serious. I haven't read any other books or series like this book but I have read the whole Percy Jackson series, and I think this is the best book out of the whole series. This last book has a ton of action and surprises, the other ones had action but more in the middle of the book and maybe one or two surprises.  I think anybody would be interested in this book, but if you haven't, I would suggest reading the whole series, if you want to be able to follow what is happening. You should definitely read this book, even if you think you won't like it, `cause who knows, you might like it.      Hannah
B0030BYWKU|2.0|I allowed my 13 year old daughter to buy this CD based on what songs of his I had heard.  It's general bubble gum music that kids seem to like know days. However, I was shocked to find the catchy \\"Going Solo\\" song includes the s*** word.  There were no labels on the CD saying it include profanity.    And if you have moral issues, Love Hangover is pretty risky as well. I would have thought it funny if he would have mentioned waking up with an STD or a pregnant girlfriend, but I guess that would not sell as well.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|This album is really good. It has some great songs and some really good ones and I would say there is not a bad song on the album. If you compare it to lady gaga or Kesha, Pink has the better song and a sweeter voice.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|I can not believe they had Oprah narrating this amazing series. The production is fabulous, the science behind it is superb, the stories are breathtaking but then the narration just makes the whole production to become a dull, high school biology class boring kind of video of which you feel required to write a report. It is a crime, is Sir. David Attenborough too British for the American audience? please...
B001AXNGX4|5.0|Definitely my favorite Dream Theater album... Probably my favorite album by anyone, ever.    If you love great drummers and / or cutting edge (for its time) progressive hard rock / metal, you should already have this album. If you don't, buy it right now. Seriously.

B002AOWXO0|5.0|If you're a Pete Yorn fan then you won't be let down with this CD. When I first took a listen to the sample songs I wasn't all that impressed...nothing struck me like Yorn's early songs like \\"For Nancy\\" or \\"Closet.\\"  Yet, I was hooked on the first track \\"Relator,\\" which just reeled me into making my purchase.  In addition, I was at first a little skeptical about Scarlett Johansson teaming up with Yorn, but the marriage of her velvety voice, his croon and pop hooks are perfect.  Since the day I received the CD I've been listening to it daily (um....that's going on a month, can't go a day without \\"Relator\\" or \\"Search Your Heart\\").  So for all those Yorn fans out there, put it in your shopping cart!!!!
B002JVWQXC|5.0|It was Thursday night in September. The weather was nice, not too cold, not too warm. TV on the other hand, well, at that point its Thursday line-up had a lot to be desired. So I turned on Wheel of Fortune to see if the woman who was up $10,000 would hit the bankrupt slot or guess that the answer was \\"Granny's Homemade Apple Pie.\\" Usually I would flip through the channels during commercial breaks, but like I said there was nothing else on. And then I saw a commercial that caught my attention. Popping up on the screen of my television was a 20-some odd girl with big blue braces, red glasses, and frizzy hair. \\"Ugly Betty! The world premiere at 8/7 central!\\" the narrator declared. And I decided to watch. 9 months 11 months later I found myself purchasing [[ASIN:B00005JPII Ugly Betty - The Complete First Season]] and then 14 months later I purchased [[ASIN:B0018CWEXA Ugly Betty: The Complete Second Season]] and then a year and a half later I purchased [[ASIN:B001L1S1SK Ugly Betty: Season 3]] and then I found myself watching season season 4.<br /><br />  And it wasn't too long before I found myself reading on Wikipedia that the brilliant, award-winning show was cancelled by ABC. Once again, ABC cancelled a great show. At least we got four seasons out of this one. But before I continue I just have to put this out there, SPOILER ALERT! In season 4 we open up with Betty getting her braces removed, but of course it was just a dream. We see her getting her new job has a junior-editor. We see her getting back together with Matt (with whom she broke up with in the season 3 finale). And as we go on further into the season seeing her house burn down. We see a lot more, and with only four episodes left, I just hope that \\"Ugly Betty\\" ends as good as it began.<br /><br />  And now to the DVD. The box set will most likely consist of 5 discs. Special features will probably include commentary, either video or audio, featurettes, and webisodes of \\"Mode After Dark.\\"
1423119509|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I like Mythology, and thought it was a great idea for the author to incorporate a series of books where kids are also taught about mythology in a fun and exciting way.  Don't buy the book thinking it will be the movie, because it is not.  The end of the 5th book left an opening for more to come if the author felt like writing them, or he could also end it here.  I would like to see it continue with the same characters. I must confess that I bought these for myself, not for young kids.  When my 20 yr old daughter has time, she will read them as well. I do like the boxed set that comes in a chest-like box with the lagniappe at the bottom. The box chest was shipped to me with absolutely no tears whatsoever.  It is difficult to get the books out, but holding the box upside down and shaking does the trick.  I highly recommend this for \\"older kids\\" as well as younger kids.

Very relevant, current, and easily to become connected and emotionally drawn to the characters.  (just like all Sparks books)  But the story line of this book is SO deep.  Wonderful wonderful book.     Thanks again Nicholas....
B001OQCV2E|1.0|This is like a family movie - only with 'f'bombs galore, people being cut in two, and terrible terrible acting.  Well the acting thing may be a stretch...it stinks in family movies too.  Seriously though to watch a limo jump a falling building was so over-the-top and ridiculous I had a hard time making it till the end.
0307387151|2.0|I absolutely loved the first part of this book. McEwan poses troubling and probing questions about what children see as reality, and whether an incomplete picture of the world can result in a full understanding of truth. It was gripping and intellectually stimulating, and I couldn't wait to see how he would answer these questions.    He didn't.     The book changes pace in Part II and never regains ground after that. McEwan hides behind the sweeping and emotional backdrop of a World War. Yes, it's exciting, but I put it on par with the emotional puppeteering of Danielle Steel. You'll get wrapped up in the excitement and tragedy of the War, which are emotions grounded in the WAR, not the book itself. Great literature gets left behind. It's too easy to use the war to propel the story, and for me the substance completely melted away.      The book ended for me feeling no vindication or catharsis. Briony seems to have no remorse, nor does she learn anything from her terrible judgment. I know very well that I am in the minority, but this book began with such incredible promise and left me feeling completely deflated.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler is a great deal on price to performance scale. At only $30, you get what a lot of coolers give you at half the price. With the money you're saving, definitely buy a second 120mm fan to push/pull the cooler for better performance.    It's very easy to install. Any reviews saying it's not are doing so because you'll probably have to remove your motherboard to install on socket 1156 or 1366 systems, even with a motherboard tray that has backside access. That's the case for nearly every cooler that is not the stock cooler. If you're thinking about cooling beyond stock, you have to expect such things.    The toughest part of the installation is getting proper thermal compound contact on the CPU surface, due to the direct touch heat pipes. Be sure to fill the grooves on the block with thermal compound and scrape smooth, then run 3 short lines on the aluminum block lines between the heat pipes to allow for expansion when pressure is applied. If you do this, you'll get excellent contact on the CPU. I tested this a few times to be sure I had a good pattern, after the first install gave temps above what was expected.    I would recommend 2 higher CFM fans (R4s work well, cheaply, without too much noise) set up in push/pull to maximize cooling. The extra $15 is well worth the gain you'll get.    The performance was very good, but my goals for overclocking were more aggressive. I ended up replacing this cooler with a Corsair H50, which improved temperatures by quite a few degrees. At a little over 2x the cost of the 212 Plus, it performed better, but your definitely paying for it.    You can't beat the price of this cooler. It's cheap versus the top end coolers and gives you performance that is very compatible with most other air coolers. It's truly a great deal for the cost.

B00028HBKC|3.0|I was put off by The Passion because of not knowing who most of the people were. I could suppose which character was Pontius Pilot, but could only guess who was King Herod. I could figure out which character was Jesus' mother Mary, and which was Mary Magdalene, but not if Joseph was even in the movie. The movie began right before Judas betrayed Jesus so it passed by a lot of material covered at the beginning of Jesus Christ Superstar. The movie ended right after Jesus' death while I had wished it would continue to His resurrection. However much Gibson had shown of what was physically done to Jesus, other than how he showed the depth of love both Mary's showed for Him, it left too many holes for me. I expected the violence, having read many reviews prior to finally seeing the movie for the first time Sunday, March 21, a week before Palm Sunday. I won't go into a rundown of the plot since that has been done innumerable times, but if the movie showed Judas' suicide, I must not have been looking at he screen. I did enjoy the glimpses of Jesus' ministry work where we could see what he looked like before the Roman soldiers began having their fun. I also enjoyed the scenes with His mother and how much she loved him while a young boy, and now as a grown man put to unbelievable torture. I wondered if the soldiers' intent was to scourge him to death until an officer stepped in to stop them. I was pleased I could be mesmerized by Gibson's film without missing the songs that made up Jesus Christ Superstar. I also enjoyed hearing another language spoken though I had forgotten it was Armenian until I reread a review that reminded me of that. Despite the daring viewpoint of how much savagery was displayed by the punishers, little was made of how much He suffered during the crucifixion itself, though certainly the long walk, the driving in of the nails in His plams, and especially for me the attaching of His legs to the post were thoroughly co vered. When Jesus gave up His spirit to God, the storm that ensued well described God's way of communicating the great importance of what had taken place -- that His only-begotton Son had died for man's sins. Even so, I will still favor the more-watered down versions of this epoch.o God, the storm that ensued well described God's way of communicating the great importance of what had taken place -- that His only-begotton Son had died for man's sins.

081297963X|4.0|I do not regret buying this book.  Through the photos you get a chance to see her personal life, especially her relationship with Susan and her parents.  And these personal photos are so telling..love...pride...respect..sorrow. I almost felt that the few celebrity photos really didn't belong.  The reason for the four stars is the placement of many of the photos, caught between two pages. It is very distracting and you lose so much when they are presented that way. But really, this is a wonderful collection of a life as seen through a camera.

1594133379|5.0|Being a stroke survivor myself, this book has a wealth of information.  Although a couple of chapters are simply scientific information and need waded through, doing so provides considerable knowledge.  The writer of the book obviously had a huge struggle with rehab, but what she writes rings so true with me and my stroke.   Additionally, she write compellingly about what the stroke survivor needs and wants.   This book really needs to be required reading for the families of stroke victims as well as nurses and other care-givers in the medical field.   I'd like to see it be required reading for those who work on neuroscience units.  If a nurse, nursing student interested in neurology, medical student interested in neurology and associated areas is wondering about reading this book - I'd say READ IT DEFINITELY!!!!!  Well worth your time!!
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|This movie was so much fun, and I mean talking to the screen fun (for my A.A. folks..you know who you are..talking during the movie LOL). I didn't think it would be that good sense I didn't like the American version at all, infact the audience laughted most of the time during quarentine, I almost fell asleep.  Not so with REC..they got it right. Maybe it was because it was a foreign language film that made it more believable or the actors gave a good performance...whatever it was, this was the horror movie I have been waiting to see for about 10 years now.  THANK YOU SPAIN!****Update there is a 2 disc set available....they are selling it on here for a penny!
1400076943|5.0|It's one of those wonderful stories that can broaden your perspective while being incredibly emotionally engaging. This is an amazing first novel from such a young writer with her heart and soul in it.It's a vivid, beautifully written novel about a 14 year-old girl named Kambili growing up in a stifling Catholic household in Nigeria. The story pairs the collapse of the family's strong patriarch who frequently physically abuses his family alongside with the deterioration of the Nigerian society's infrastructure as it undergoes a military coup. Kambili is a very sheltered child who is incredibly insecure because of the repressive regimen her father forces her to follow. Yet, she is looked down upon by her peers and initially scorned by her outspoken cousin because she is viewed as a privileged snob. When she visits her aunt and cousins she learns how to assert herself and become a more independent individual.   Adichie knows the language of the abused child and speaks simply, directly to her audience. She garners an audience of survivors who respond to personal empowerment, wrapped in hope.This powerful, yet subtle novel is striking on two levels: one is the subjection of society to the tyranny of the chaos that results from a political coup; the second is the role of family in the formation of children's lives.

B002VECM4A|5.0|It is reviewed by a lot of people that it is \\"okay\\" , \\"intense\\" or etc. after I watch this dvd (I didn't buy this dvd directly from this site) I understand why because too many people don't want to face the facts that they are in abusive enivorments or sick world like News shows. But that is what her movie reflects, I am not ashamed to say but I like it! I am the one who can face the facts that we all are not perfect living in very extended vicious ill-mannered world , where a family may be pretend to smile outside then at home they abuse a child or agrue too much with husband. Why dislike the movie? If you don't like that movie, it must mean you are not ready to deal or resolve your situation. You might never will. I just watch it and will point out \\"Yes mom, that woman act a little like you when you are angry\\" I am not scared because we all don't have 100% normal perfectly family . If I watched, it must means that courage built up inside me and I am ready to move on.

B001BPJJ82|4.0|The Fall is a movie you could use to prove someone wrong if they said they didn't think film could be art. This movie is absolutely beautiful, one of the most visually compelling films I've ever seen. The story is simple, but interesting. Most the movie takes place in a fantasy world where a man is telling a little girl a story. That said, there are some (purposeful) plot holes, and the characters change without warning as the story develops. That's not bad, it's just different and something you should know to expect.     The Fall is a hard movie to categorize because it's truly unique. The only fantasy film I enjoy as much (a bit more then, really) then this film is Pan's Labyrinth. The real difference, though, is the consistency. What makes Pan's Labyrinth 5 stars to me is beautiful visuals with realistic characters and an amazing story. The Fall is beautiful, it has perfectly realistic characters, but it's story and style waiver a little. Pan's Labyrinth is dark, truly disturbing. The Fall starts off light hearted, as a children's story. When it's end takes on a tragic tone, and shows, unflinching the most graphic impaling I've seen on film, it really catches you off your guard. The Fall is a good movie, but it's an inconsistent movie. I loved it, I hated it. There are parts that make you want to laugh, parts that make you want to cry. Is it a perfect movie? No. Is it a movie that every film student in the world should watch? Certainly. The Fall is a piece of art, and that's more then I can say for most films I've seen recently.     It's hard for me not to give The Fall 5 stars based sheerly on it's acting and beautiful style, but I can't do that in good conscience. The Fall is an odd movie. It starts out more family friendly then most movies in the world, ends with a hard R. I don't mind hard R movies, my favorite films are District 9 and Pan's Labyrinth, both hard Rs. What does bother me is the abrupt, awkward change in tone that you see in The Fall. The Fall ending as it did would be like The Spiderwick Chronicles ending with a sudden burst of obscenity from the main character before he graphically dismembers the main evil character. It simply wouldn't fit. I don't exactly understand what changed the end of the movie from the style of the beginning, and wish it had wrapped up better. I recommend the Fall to everyone who's a fan of beautiful art and appreciates good acting, but I would be wrong to call it a perfect movie.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|I can't say I have really cared for most of the Jane Austen movies that I've seen on Masterpiece Theatre these last few years, but this movie is an exception.  The acting is good, but more importantly, the characters' personalities haven't been changed.  Yes, a few things aren't quite right (including Mr. Knightly's age, but he is so lovely!), however, the movie is very entertaining.
B000L212HW|1.0|Reign of Fire aspires to be great. It puts a high mark for itself, and falls utterly short. The total of a movie is the sum of its parts, and the parts I sum up are its characters, its story, and its visuals. Most the time, you get at least one really good element in any movie. Avatar might lack story, but it's visuals are unbelievable. Moon might lack deep characters, but it's story is amazing. Inglorious Basterds might lack breathtaking visuals, but it's characters drive it incredibly well. Reign of Fire fails in absolutely every category. It's visuals are absolutely terrible, with some of the worst effects I've seen in my life. The fact that Bladerunner or Starwars, made more then two decades before Reign of Fire, both have highly better visuals is absolutely unacceptable. If they didn't have budget for CGI, then use something else. I was shocked how fake the dragons looked. And for a movie with the word \\"fire\\" in its title, the fire effects in this movie are absolutely awful. This is easily the worst fire I've ever seen. They should have used stock footage if they couldn't manage to render it right, but alas, they didn't. I can't even stress how awful the computer generated effects in this movie are. This is 2002, not 1999. If you're going to have CGI, there's no excuse for it not looking real. Who worked on this movie, high school students? Even the rather disappointing Outlander has far better effects then Reign of Fire, and actually was done by college students.     Regarding the story and characters, Reign of Fire falls even flatter then it does in the visual area. The characters are unbelievably badly acted. Reign of Fire makes Christian Bale's performance in Terminator Salvation look Oscar worthy. Matthew McConaughey does what he can with his terrible written character, but there's just not that much that he can do. All the supporting characters are flat, and there's no one you can really sympathize with. Bale's character is painted as wrongly driven... asif surviving is a bad motive. MacConaughey is the stereotypical idiotic fighter who runs into battle without a shirt on, swinging a sword in an age when people generally use nuclear armaments. Children's cartoons have deeper characters then Reign of Fire.    Though the visuals are disappointing, the characters flat, the story is by far the worst thing in Reign of Fire. The writer must have purposefully tried to lace it with holes. Why can dragons see perfectly well in the bright day, and in pitch black, but not in mid-light? That doesn't even remotely make sense. How is there only one male dragon? What single species on earth has only one male period? Sure, we have bees and ants who have one queen per hive, but there are thousands of males and females in any species that wants to survive! The idea of one male is simply absurd. What drives any of the characters? What's the point of the movie?    I wish I could find anything good in Reign of Fire. I really try to review movies fairly. I gave Outlander three stars. It might not be great, but there are good action scenes, a few well done effects, and the middle of it actually has some interesting characters. I wish that Reign of Fire had any interesting characters, any good fight scenes, or any good effects. But it doesn't. You would have to look pretty hard to find a movie worse then Reign of Fire. If you really want a decent B-movie about dragons, try Outlander. It's not good, but at least it isn't utterly terrible.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I own every movie made of \\"Persuasion\\" and this is absolutely the best.  While Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are too old for their parts, they are so wonderful that you'll forget.  The story line is changed a bit with Mrs. Smith and Mr. Elliot (for no apparent reason), however, the movie is still wonderful.  Enjoy!!
B001AVCFK6|4.0|Great movie. I love all the extras on the disc's.  I would have given it a five star except that when   I purchased the disc's it was suppose to come   with a model of the enterprise. I contacted amazon   and they informed me that they were out of them.  Although that was not a deal breaker, It would  have been nice to know they were out. So if it shows  a model with it dont count on receiving it.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|It's not a complex or avant garde film - it is not about that.  This is just an American rendition of the story of the famous dog from Japan, Hachiko.  It is simple, but poignant.  If you like dogs, or animals in general, you should love this film.  If you are not such an animal lover, you may even like it.  It tugs at the heart, and without having  to \\"say it\\" in dialogue, this film is an allegory about how gestures really display your love.  This film is a small reminder to us about how loved ones, pets, and the little things in life are best and most important.  I really enjoyed this film but was weeping for about half of it - be warned.  They were good tears though. :)<br /><br />The movie itself was well made, with good production value, and did the nice balance of not being too cheesy, and digestible for adults and kids.  The acting was good too for the genre.  When you think family dog movie, you think corny and cheesy acting and cliched items, but this film really does a good job of having elegance and not being too kitschy.  I like how the writer(s) and director stayed true to the Japanese real life story while adding the American touch to it.  Furthermore, the showed the story, used actions and gestures to develop the sentiment and strength of the emotion running in this film; i.e., they did not \\"tell\\" it.  As much as this is a story about Hachi, the film was about the family, friends, and the town, and I like how the story and scenes were put together to give the film depth and emotion.  In a time of special effects and over the top plots, this movie was a welcome change.<br /><br />As much as dogs and animals are part of our fabric it is hard to avoid kitsch, but this film is one of the best dog movies ever, and a good film in general.  But it should not even be analyzed like that.  It is meant to be a popcorn eating and watch the show movie.  It does the job, and does the job well.  Movies like these are treasures, because they snap us out of our hectic and consumer driven lives and remind us to live.  For art and for movies like this, I am grateful because even the best of us need a reminder once in a while.  Hachi is a sobering reminder that family, friends, and pets are what makes us.  As an aside, this is coming from a man whose list of favorite movies include Apocalypse Now, The Godfather II, Goodfellas, Heat, Snatch, Pulp Fiction, and Inglorious Basterds.  That says something.  I think you'll love this little gem as much as me.driven lives and remind us to live.  For art and for movies like this, I am grateful because even the best of us need a reminder once in a while.

B0034JKZ8G|3.0|This is not one of the best Disney animated movies out there, nor is it the worst. It kind of just falls right in the middle which is why I give it 3 stars. The movie starts out with a lot of promise but then gets bogged down and slow half way through it with by going off track just so they could add a few more songs. There are some scenes that may be too scary for younger kids (2-6) with themes about selling your soul to the devil and sacraficing lives which is a complete 180 from their main theme which is that you can acheive your dream with hard work.<br /><br />Even that theme gets bogged down with ideas like marrying into money, and money can still get you happiness over hard work. I think the Prince actually had the \\"best\\" life. He was able to enjoy most of his life mooching off his parents. Then he found the love of his life, and was able to settle down with her and do what he was passionate about(music) without having to learn much about hard work....so Luck> Money > hard work> day dreaming?

0385504225|4.0|I'm a fan of The DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons. I liked Digital Fortress and thought The Lost Symbol would be equally exciting.    It was the best and worst of Dan Brown. His chapters are incredibly short, some are only 2 paragraphs which makes you read more in one sitting, and they usually end in a cliff hanger.    Brown's Robert Langdon is back and this time he's racing around Washington D.C. Langdon is invited to be a guest speaker for a friend from the Smithsonian Institute but when he arrives, the adventure begins.    Taking us for a ride through the monuments and historical D.C., Brown reveals some secrets of the Masons, Christianity and other ancient religions.    Like DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons, Brown takes snippets of religious ideas and tweaks them to create a thrilling post-modern tale of codes, clues, twists and turns.    I found Angels & Demons to be more thrilling and The DaVinci Code to be more interesting, but The Lost Symbol is most certainly worth the read. Get together with friends who like to talk and debate religion and philosophy all night, and this book will be a great guide.    Love him or hate him, Dan Brown knows how to stir up controversy and keep you turning the pages.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Watched this movie today with my 8 year old, we were both crying for at least 30 mins. You may want to keep a new box of tissues handy. I have had an Akita and already knew the story but it still brings on a flood of tears. We loved the movie.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Loved it. Waiting impatiently for the third season to become available for purchase. These characters are funny and wonderful.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I'm thankful the Basterds at least won one oscar.  Christoph Waltz is a phenomenal actor, and his performance never gets old as I watch the film over and over. He won best supporting actor for this role in 2009, and without him in the film, I doubt the Oscars would be paying so much attention to this flick.  Inglorious Basterds does not top Tarantino's previous films, but it sure does come damn close.  It definately surpassed his most recent films, being Kill Bill and Death Proof.  This movie sits nearly neck and neck with Pulp Fiction, because it's an instant classic of the Tarantino brand.<br /><br />This was a script he took a lot more of his careful time with.  I felt gratified that I waited so long for another film of his, because he put all that time to good use.  He created an original story that does not follow any guidelines or traditions.  Basterds is incredibly intelligent but at the same time it's horrifying.  It's as if Tarintino's statement is, no one tells me what to do.  Brad Pitt gave us a role that makes Tyler Durden go unnoticed.  I was proud to see him show what acting really is, and how much Hollywood never really acts.  Along with Pitt, all the actors are amazing in this film.  With a Tarantino script and A-Grade actors, nothing can go wrong with this film.<br /><br />However, some have criticized the film for various reasons.  They claim there's major innaccuracies, but I don't believe Tarantino made much of an effort to be accurate rather than tell a story.  Inglorious Basterds is not a History film, it's just a great story and that's all I can really say.  The violence I somewhat agree with.  It doesn't bother me, but I think Tarantino could have had more luck at the Oscars if he left it out.  I think Eli Roth has a little too much influence over him, and their type of gore really does not have much value in terms of filmmaking tools.  It was a little interesting, and made it feel barely realistic, but at the same time it felt extremely out of place with all the talent flowing.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release is ok.  The special features felt a little short but sweet.  There's no commentary, which is a little bit of a letdown.  They did not add in U-Control to this Universal disc to my delight, but they did throw in a slew of Live Features, which I wonder if anyones really using.  As far as a blu-ray disc goes, the package gets a 3.5/5.  As far as how good the film is, I always skip hesitating and say it's a 5/5.l the talent flowing.    The Blu-ray release is ok.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|I don't think it's necessary to repeat a review of the production itself; that has been done more elegantly than I can create and I will defend the 5-star rating to anyone. As an illustration:<br /><br />I first showed this production to my older parents and my teen aged daughter (and friend) starting at 9:00 p.m. one summer vacation evening. At 1:00 a.m. we had only seen 3/5 of the film and I suggested we wait until the next day to finish. \\"NOOO!!\\" arose from everyone, even my father (who loves to sleep). We finished by 3:00 a.m. After sleeping for ~6 hours, still morning, I came downstairs to check on my daughter and her friend; they had already begun what would be their second of three viewings over the next 24 hours!<br /><br />What makes this product distinctive is the BEAUTIFULLY REALIZED TRANSFER TO HIGH DEFINITION. The quality of the PREVIOUS DVD has been NOTORIOUSLY BAD (washed out colors & a look as if a worn-out tape was used as the source). If the production weren't so wonderful it could have been a tragic product altogether. With this transfer ORIGINAL COLOR AND QUALITY IS RESTORED! Honestly, I first saw this on VHS in standard definition, so this is actually the most beautiful I've seen this landmark production.<br /><br />The DVD extras are excellent, with a fascinating series of interviews with original cast and production personnel relating the excitement and controversy surrounding the project. I could only have been happier if Jennifer Ehle were included; she was apparently unavailable to the documentarians. I would also have enjoyed a commentary track with the director/writer and/or actors.<br /><br />I have stopped buying DVDs and BDs for the most part in this digital age where everything is becoming available over broadband, \\"on-demand,\\" and physical reproductions aren't necessary. I make an exception only for things I consider classic and precious; A & E's Pride and Prejudice qualifies easily.

0553582461|5.0|SPOILERS  To all those of you who are upset that Fitz ends up with Molly:  Yes, you're right.  She's hardly enough of a prize for all Fitz has done and been through.  She didn't even like Nighteyes, or ever understood Fitz's relationship with him.  I think Fitz is just choosing her at this point because he needs some peace and quiet.  But the Fool is coming back, no doubt about it.  The carving he leaves for Fitz, says \\"I've never been wise.\\"  If you start to wonder what that means, and why the Fool would let that be the last word, it all becomes clear:  It is not wise for the Fool and Fitz to be near each other, since this could send the world spinning out of control, but the Fool has never been wise, and neither has Fitz for that matter.  So, I think the Fool is saying that he will be back, and when he comes, Fitz will leave Molly and run off to some new adventure.  Let's hope I'm right!  I'm giving 5 stars because despite the disappointing ending, this is still one of the very best fantasy series ever.

B000AXSN5G|3.0|2005's Prairie Wind was widely praised by critics and received two Grammy nominations but immediately struck me and some other hard-cores as minor and overrated. Critics were undoubtedly glad that Young dropped the experimentation of his prior few albums for an ostensible return to his strengths but clearly let enthusiasm run wild. Prairie was touted as a country rock entry like Harvest and Harvest Moon but has little in common with them; its closest antecedent is the somewhat similar Comes a Time, but it is essentially unique. This is good in that it is in Young's lower midrange; he released many better albums before it and has since released more. Those not usually keen on him or who like only his more commercial side may find it worthwhile, but otherwise only hard-cores should bother.    It does resemble the Harvests in being acoustic; only \\"No Wonder\\" has electric guitar. However, it is only marginally country; the steel guitar that dominated them has a small role, and there is no banjo or other country trappings. Most songs have simple acoustic riffs, and there are quite a few keyboards plus a few horns. \\"No Wonder\\" aside, the songs have a very mellow, laid-back feel that is very calming. This is definitely easy listening and very far from Crazy Horse; it could even be pleasant background music. The real twist is newly prominent backing vocals, primarily by Young's wife Pegi. Young himself also tries out new vocal stylings, notably an increased falsetto.    The real problem is that Prairie takes the simplicity motif too far. It is refreshing and charming at first but soon grows thin; the songs simply lack substance, and a few are downright trite. There is a distinct lack of the solos that are always highlights of Young's music, and the simple melodies are not enough to carry the songs. Many long-time Young musicians - Ben Keith, Spooner Oldham, etc. - are here and play as well as ever, but he gives them very little. The vocals are also a downside. Young's signature emotion is here in full force, but his new falsetto is so bad as to be near-embarrassing; I say this as a major fan who has followed Young for years and owns many, many releases. He presumably uses it to achieve greater intimacy, but all it really does is annoy; he has thankfully not returned to it, perhaps belatedly realizing the error. His vocals are thankfully very strong otherwise; he has lost very little of his voice, especially compared to other singers his age, and his phrasing is as good as ever. This is reassuring but makes the falsetto all the more regrettable. Even worse are the backing vocals; a major part of nearly every song, they are extremely distracting and a major detraction. Young is known for having excellent backing vocals, but these are unprecedentedly bad; they clash greatly with his voice and are terrible in themselves. Pegi is unfortunately the main problem. Anyone who knows anything about Young knows how great their relationship is, and she is admirable in many ways besides being a frequent muse, but she simply cannot sing. He is apparently unable to see this, having used her prominently ever since - a truly disturbing development of which this is the first major instance. Most of the other singers are not much better.    Another major problem is the words. Young is one of the all-time great lyricists, but one would not know it from this; these are not only among his worst lyrics but would not be good for anyone. They are cliché-ridden, sentimental in the worst way, and simply trite; many seem like rough drafts. It is as if Young did not try to write good lyrics or dashed them off with little thought; he often does not even bother to rhyme. Worse yet, many songs are very repetitive, making already weak lyrics seem even worse. This is all the more sad in that the subject matter is greatly interesting. Young was diagnosed with a life-threatening aneurysm shortly before writing the songs, lost his father, and had his youngest daughter leave for college. All this turns up in the songs, which deal with both childhood and mortality and are laced with autobiographical references. Young is one of the most intensely personal of artists, and such material would presumably make a good album, but this simply fails to hold up. He may have been too close to the events to write of them meaningfully or judge the material objectively. No one can begrudge him turning anguish into art - he has practically made a career of it after all -, but it would have been better not to release work of such middling quality.    There are two major exceptions (\\"No Wonder\\" and \\"When God Made Me\\"), excellent songs with every mark of a Young classic. The former is the only uptempo cut, mixing electric power chords with energetic acoustic strumming. It also has some of Young's most interesting lyrics; written in his signature stream-of-consciousness style, it encompasses everything from his childhood to a 9/11 telethon to hunting ethics. At once personal, political, and surreal, it is a song only Young could write and all the better for it, though backing vocals undercut even it. On that note, \\"When\\" has Prairie's only effective backing vocals courtesy of the legendary Fisk University Jubilee Choir. A gospel song with a Young twist, it has beautiful piano, thought-provoking words that only he could pen, and a truly heartfelt vocal. Diehards will want the album just for these cuts, and everyone else should at least download them.    \\"This Old Guitar\\" is the next best - a slight but enjoyable song with characteristically quirky humor. Emmylou Harris' backing vocals will not convince her detractors, but they are better than nearly all others on the album. \\"It's a Dream\\" has potential; the piano is beautiful and the vocal highly touching, but is just goes on too long; there is too much repetition and generally not enough substance to justify being over six and a half minutes. It could perhaps have been good if cut in half. \\"He Was theKing\\" is somewhat funny and even quite fun but also far too long; it could have been an enjoyable minor cut if half its length or less. Young at least understood this with the decent \\"Far From Home,\\" which does not try to be more than it is. The same unfortunately cannot be said of the seven and a half plus minute title cut, which has interesting words and music but the worst backing vocals of all - so bad they would ruin an otherwise great song, much less this one. Repetition then kills what little potential it might have still had. The other three songs - including \\"The Painter,\\" which was inexplicably the track most touted in advertising and also Grammy-nominated - are among Young's worst. Musically uninteresting and lyrically asinine, they are best forgotten and indeed forgettable.    Nearly everything Young has released in the 2000s has been hotly debated by fans, but Prairie is in my view one of the weakest among them. Some may disagree, but it is certainly not the instant classic so many critics claimed. Though not without moments, one should have several dozen Young albums before even considering it.
B00275EGX8|1.0|To begin I have to say that I like every genre of movies.  This is the very first time that I noticed so hard that the academy awards are politically oriented and not artistically and to tell you the truth I am shocked not from the movie unfortunately but from the academy itself !  Please keep in mind that this is the very first time of my life that I make a written review of a movie because I found it very frustrating that they cheated on me and stole my time for watching an endless collection of psychological abnormalies from the director and the script writer or I do not know who else.  There is no conection with the reality and on the other hand this not a movie with a different meaning or a movie with a second analysis.  The only reason that this movie got 6 prizes is because is trying very hard to convince every one, that we all that we are living in the U.S and the E.U are the Good guys and when we by mistake do something very bad we are thinking very much about it so we are not so bad finally !!  Do yourself a favor and keep away from this movie is a complete time waste.  Even if you have a taste for war movies this has nothing to do with war or anti-war.  Its just poltically correct !  If you want to see this movie only from curiosity try not to spend any money for this.  The thought that someone will buy this movie especially in Blu-ray is very pathetic !  Academy awards for me were never be the same after this movie.  It is very strange that they took the awards away from Cameron and swifted them to his ex wife.  At least if nothing else Avatar is a honest movie !!

1439170045|3.0|Anyone who has ever been around someone with Alzheimer's disease or dementia should read this great book. Everyone should   read this book because at sometime we will all encounter someone wrought with this disease.  The book is written with compassion and grace. Careful if you are not prepared for the emotional upheaval you will find yourself in.    On the negative side I want to mention the hopelessness illustrated when it comes to medical solutions. I miss the fact that scientist worldwide   have come already to a solution about the real cause of this terrible disease. There are very practical solutions on how to treat it when already in progress as well as how to protect yourself against it. The name of the \\"game\\" is inflammation. The so-called   nun study ([...]) has proven that Alzheimer's is a disease of inflammation and as such treatable. Studies with mice have shown that Alzheimer's  in mice could be reversed when anti-inflammatory medicines   were mixed among their daily foods. Many Alzheimer scientists therefor believe that the real cause of the disease is inflammation. The nun study has clearly demonstrated that plaques - as the pharmaceutical industry wants you to believe - is not at all the cause of Alzheimer's. In connection with these findings, scientists (most and foremost Prof. Pat McGere) have contacted all large rheumatism centers worldwide, asking whether their rheumatism patients get also sick with Alzheimer's, which would be common thing to expect. The result was shocking: there were almost no Alzheimer patients to be found in rheumatism clinics because these people use anti-inflammatory medicines on a daily basis.   Same scientists have asked the pharmaceutical industry to produce an anti-inflammatory medicine for Alzheimer's that can be taken on a long-term   basis without causing side-effects. The pharmaceutical industry was not interested since their present medication for the disease is based on the belief that plaques is the cause of Alzheimer's - despite better knowledge and despite the evidence obtained from the nun study they do sell medications against plaques which are patented and highly profitable. However, anti-inflammatory medication cannot be patented.  The good news is that there are already herbal medications for Alzheimer's available that aim to treat exactly this very root cause   of Alzheimer's, which is inflammation and not plaques. More on these scientific findings, the background of the nun study and why the nun study has proven once and for all that plaques is not the cause of the disease you can find at: [...]  You will find there the scientific experiments made, you will see documentary movies, you will listen to the interviews with respective Alzheimer scientists involved and you will learn about the    the refusal by the pharmaceutical industry to produce a medication based on these findings. On same website you will also find a herbal medication that suits the needs.     From this view point, which sheds a very different light on this disease,  Alzheimer's does not have to be as hopeless as it seems in Lisa Genova's book Still Alice.     There are millions of Alzheimer sufferers around the globe who have a right that scientific findings are taken seriously by the industry and transformed into a suitable medication, even such a medication is not that profitable as a plaques medication is.

B0017I1FNK|3.0|I first heard Emmylou after purchasing a copy of her 'all the road running' cd she did with Mark Knopfler. That cd influenced me to purchase this cd as I really liked Emmylou's vocals.    I must say this cd reminds me so much of Dolly Parton's bluegrass cd ('the grass is blue' and 'little sparrow') arrangements. Similar in that there is a lot of dubbing and background vocals. I consider this is only necessary to compensate for a vocalist's shortcomings. Emmylou has a superior voice to Dolly's and there really is no need to compromise Emmylou's vocals with this unnatural sound.    So, I am a little disappointed with this cd but I will continue hunting for another cd from Emmylou in the hope that one has been produced with a more natural sound.
B003AYDPYQ|5.0|I started watching Breaking Bad during the first season on AMC. At first, the advertisement drew my interest for the series but I was cynical and doubted it would be very good. I've was hooked after I watched the first show and I loved the story and the acting is excellent.

0140157352|2.0|This book had some interesting information but nothing groundbreaking.  Like the conclusion chapter says, there's probably nothing in the book you didn't already know on some level.  I was having particular trouble with a landlord that didn't want to negotiate(despite trying to sell me at a price $100/mo over the advertised price).  In the chapter on how to deal with people who don't want to negotiate, the main example is of a rentor/landlord negotiation.  However, its a complete fairy tale.  I attempted all the techniques to get them to discuss the issue based on its merits but they wouldn't budge.  I tried to work with them to bring in independent standards but they dug in further.  I tried working up multiple fair solutions so they had options to choose from without losing face, they grew hostile.  To preempt the question, I had also brought all my market research and the advertised price was in fact fair, but the asking price was at least $75/mo too high.    I've also read [[ASIN:0553371312 Getting Past No]], and its really just an expansion on the points of the chapter in Getting to Yes.  Bottom line, what works at Harvard amongst people working on negotiation techniques doesn't work in real life when you have an actual person using positional bargaining and knowing no other type of negotiation.  This book is great in theory, but falls far short of the mark in practice.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|Where to begin..? I was stung by (the) SCORPIONS when \\"Tokyo Tapes\\" was released in the states. Then I went back to get the 5 albums I needed to properly learn about this fairly new band. I had the great pleasure of meeting Klaus, Herman & Rudy on the \\"Blackout Tour\\". They are the coolest guys. I rocked hard (and shed a tear) with their great catalog of music and today, the 23rd of March I recieved in thier last studio LP, \\"Sting In The Tail\\". A very bittersweet day in Rock for me. If Klaus is reading this post, let me say, \\"SLY\\" touched me like no other. I feel I am in the same situation with my son. I could not have said it better. You want the sting of your offspring growing up and onto thier own lives but they never seem to understand how hard it hurts you.<br />I sure hope you come to Rhode Island on the farewell tour. So far, the closest is Jones Beach and that is too far. OK, we are all men, but Klaus,Rudy,Matthius, Herman (ze German), Francis, Uli & James will always be \\"Here In My Heart\\"! My best to you all!

0393072231|5.0|I, for one, am QUITE upset that *my* preferred format is not supported.    (My favorite way to consume content is in depth and challenging conversation with those better informed than myself.)    I would be happy to pay at least as much as standard Kindle prices, but I want the author to come to my home to discuss the content with me. I would get a lot more of out it than having to read the entire hard cover book by myself.     Amazon should, at the very least, set up a book club made up of smart people who have read the book and are willing to meet at *my* convenience. Considering how long book clubs have existed, this hardly seems unreasonable.
0756405890|2.0|My review may be a bit off as a result of my having just finished the first 6 books by Salvatore that involve Drizzt (The Dark Elf Triology and the Icewind Dale Trilogy).  I say this because I very much liked all those books and with the reviews that The Name of the Wind has gotten, I expected much action and excitment - of which there is very little.    I very much liked the beginning of the book - but that is all I can say that I liked about it.  This is a 700 page book that lacks advanture, action or a good plot.  I am not sure why this book has gotten the reviews that it has.  It was a chore getting through this book. I knew less than half way though that this book was not going to be very good but with the reviews I kept hoping it would turn into something. It never happened.  Don't continue to read this book hoping something exciting will come near the end - it does not. Don't expect answers either - you will not find any.    This book also lacks character and background. You never really get a feel for where you are at any given time. The surroundings are not explained.  There is not much magic in this book so the comparison to Harry Potter is just wrong.  There is no comparison and yes, I have read all the Harry Potter books. None were this bad.  The characters are also not developed well.  The main female character is Deena.  She is very ood. I don't know if she is good or is a prostitute. She comes and goes all the time in the book so the relationship between Kote and her never really develops.        If you have not read my review on Moby Dick, look at it and then you will know why I finished it. Many are so looking forward to the next book. I don't think I will be picking it up any time soon or shortly after its release.  If the next book lacks the character building and action that this one did, then it is sure to disappoint.  The only reason that this book did not get a 1 star is because there are some good chapters.  Out of 93 chapters, I would estimte that maybe 25 are good.    If you like fantasy books, I would recommend Terry Brooks, David Eddings, R.A. Salvatore, and J.V. Jones.  Please don't waste your time on this book - life is too short and there are so many books out there that are better than this one in this genre.

0743298039|2.0|(Spoiler alert-several plot points are revealed in this review.)      I kind of liked the first half, and was curious about Margaret and Vita, but then story started to drag at Dr. Maudsley's and supernanny Hester's scientific interference with twins, and rapidly went downhill from there.      The author hits us over the head with Jane Eyre references so often (19, I checked.), it's tiresome and insulting, yes, we get it, you're enraptured by and paying homage to Jane Eyre.  But Diane Setterfield is no Charlotte Bronte.  Setterfield's idea of romance leaves the reader cold.       Every relationship in the book is so warped and, well, just depressing - the older brother Charlie's incest of younger sister Isabelle; Isabelle coming on to the neighbor girl, Sybilla, at the picnic; Isabelle detachedly seeing Roland; Charlie raping first Sybilla and then all the neighborhood girls; and Adeline and Emmeline's way-beyond-sisterly obsession with each other. Despite hints, absolutely nothing develops with Aurelius and Margaret, and Dr. Chilton and Margaret oddly hitting it off at the end is apparently based on her dedication in recording Vita's story.  That's love?  The writer hasn't a clue.  The closest she comes to intimacy is the platonic relationship between Mrs. Dunne and Mr. Digence, 15 years her junior, and Margaret's comfortable routine with her father.  If she was writing a satire of a romance novel, I'd get it, but no, that's not where she was going with it.     The real Jane Eyre has her pride, self worth, wit, and personal growth set in a clearly defined era where basic freedoms are denied a woman.  I found none of these themes in the 13th Tale.  Really, the only part that really resembles Jane Eyre is a secret nut setting fires in an old English manor.  The story's mostly current setting with modern conveniences such as light switches and cars leaves the reader guessing, where's their cell phones when it snows and the lines are down?  When is it supposed to takeplace?  It starts out current, but then you start to doubt it.  Is she saying that in this time and place, the Charlies of the world can run around raping women with no consequence?  In England, just one generation ago?  Really?    There's too many mental cases.  That's such a cheap device in a novel, it lets the author introduce any random act as part of a character, because, \\"hey, they're nuts, must be reasonable.\\"  Charlotte Bronte wisely limited herself to one lunatic in the attic.      Finally, it's just not believable.  No twins I've ever met even slightly resemble these characters.  She hasn't created a world that's consistent in itself.  And how did abandoned, filthy, so-hidden-from-sight-she's-almost-a-ghost urchin Vita Winter learn to produce such popular, extraordinary books with zero education?  When did she even learn to read?  From who?      In the end, it's just an unpleasant, unlikable, forgettable read.    Don't buy it.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Critics call Gran Torino a Dirty Harry movie. Not! You must be confused or uncaring to align Gran Torino with Dirty Harry.<br /><br />Dirty Harry was licensed violence with an unbeatable never say die spirit protecting the American way of life from the underbelly scum of life.<br /><br />Walt Kowalski is a defeated, deformed & hate filled balloon of self-pity hiding behind a mask of uncaring obscenities & the assurance of his own rightness.<br /><br />He's been hurt in a very real manner, by the war, the American society's rejection of him & his buddies, by the ability of those \\"gooks\\" to follow him across an ocean. He's hurt by the kind of kids his family has grown up to be, by how that growing up dishonors his memory of his wife (the greatest woman in the world).<br /><br />The death of his wife who was the great love of his life & the only love of post Vietnam era life he viewed as the final betrayal of life itself. Other women would be off limits as they couldn't possibly measure up to the best woman in the world.<br />It is what makes his don't come near me behavior completely unbending.<br /><br />Enter Sue Lor: He did his best I'm a foul mouthed, gook hating, no good American war vet act & she: well she wasn't shocked or repulsed or scared. She's just disconcertingly straightforward & quietly persistent. By god, she's a little mystifying. She's, She's sorta like the best woman in the world. It was these qualities that attracted his positive attention & allowed Sue to restore his faith in women along with the Hmong family restoring his faith in society. Remember the line, \\"By god I've got more in common with these gooks than I do with my own family.\\"<br /><br />He says to himself: Self he says (sorry I couldn't stop it), we need to check this out closer. Hope is reborn! He thinks, what she likes will be worthy of liking, what she loves will be worthy of loving & what she dislikes will be dishonorable. He still understands & believes in honor & dishonor. It's the only thing that has kept him from descending to a beast.<br /><br />The Hmong had everything that he wanted in a person, a family & a society except maybe bravery displayed by action. He now has a cause & a purpose. THIS AIN'T DIRTY HARRY. It's Romeo & Juliet without the sex.<br /><br />From my great enemy is sprung my great love. Just because it's a thought from a Vietnam vet about a Hmong family does not reduce the truth & wonder of that statement. Once again, remember the line: \\"My god, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do with my own family.\\" I would add their society also.<br /><br />The most un-Dirty Harry like thing of this show (it's huge) is the fact that it starts with a man that has given up on life. His wife is gone, his kids suck & his health is gone. This isn't the kinda guy that lays in bed waiting for the grim reaper. He is looking for a way to commit suicide without dishonor. If you didn't pick up on the suicide bit early maybe you were Dirty Harry befuddled too. His sacrifice at the end was his honorable cause.<br /><br />The first time he coughs up blood I told my wife, \\"He's a suicide looking for a place & a reason to happen.\\" The only value he had retained at that point was honor so he couldn't sit down & \\"eat\\" his rifle. Having found another best & honorable woman he felt he could follow her to a suitable cause. His relationship with Thao was instigated by Sue not the attempted theft. He then found his cause through Thao. The giving of his life reflects his rediscovered belief that life is worthwhile & something to die for is good. He had that going to Vietnam & lost it there.<br /><br />Now he is full cycle: From disillusionment & hate back to hope & love. He surely loves the people he gave his life for & hopes it improves their life.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that the beating & rape of Sue didn't unhinge his mind again (the suicide was already planned folks).It was as if he finally understood THERE ISN'T JUST ONEBEST PERSON IN THE WORLD THERE ARE MANY. His faith was restored.<br /><br />Tremendous show!

B000PMGS8G|5.0|Here's a hint on how to proceed when watching this film:  THIS IS A MELODRAMA!  Dino de Laurentis said as much while promoting the film when it was first released.  Every costume, every facial expression, and much of the dialog was meant to be over the top (and it is).  de Laurentis wanted the film to be like a comic book come to life.

Easily 5 Stars.<br /><br />I don't need to post a detailed review - many others have done it.<br /><br />However to see a bunch of crybaby Kindle users giving Michael Lewis one star makes me sick to my stomach.  This is a review of the book not of your opinion about whether it should be on your kindle.  Take your bitching to where it belongs - and that's not in the review section.<br /><br />Personally I've been on the fence about getting a Kindle. However I feel that an electronic book should be much cheaper than the hardcover version - I don't even think they are cheap enough yet even on Amazon.<br /><br />If you want to bitch about pricing them look at APPLE who is allowing publishers to charge full price for a digital copy.  Amazon is ON YOUR SIDE and your ripping on them.  You should be angry at Apple not Amazon.<br /><br />Because of the IPAD you are all going to be paying much more for digital books because Steve Jobs took what little power Amazon had about pricing away just to get publishers to his little new device.  It's the greed of Apple that's hurting you not Amazon.<br /><br />Amazon is a great company - selling books at extremely good prices with reasonable shipping.  Who would like to go buy an $800 IPAD to read a more expensive digital book on a device that doesn't even read as well as the kindle.<br /><br />Instead of wrecking a great book like this you should be taking the fight to Apple and the Publishers where it belongs.

1416562605|2.0|I've read other Indian authors - Salman Rushdie, Rohinton Mistry, Vijay Singh, Manil Suri - and this guy is not in their league at all so I cannot understand why he won the Booker Prize.  Yes, he has the modern-snarkiness down pat and while it was an interesting read, and the character's voice was clear and fully realized, he lost me when he had his character remark that \\"..only four men in history have led successful revolutions to free the slaves and kill their masters...: Alexander the Great.  Abraham Lincoln of America. Mao of your country.  And a fourth man.  It may have been Hitler, I can't remember.    Hitler?  Thrown out as a comic aside?  Not cool - even from a snarky guy.  And this, \\"White men will be finished within my lifetime.  There are blacks and reds, too, but I have no idea what they're up to - the radio never talks about them.  My humble prediction: in twenty years' time, it will be just us yellow men and brown men at the top of the pyramid, and we'll rule the whole world.\\"    Funny - the Indian writers here do not like this book so much, but the English do - irony is dead?

0316010669|1.0|I have never written a review before but I owe it any unsuspecting reader out there to tell you.....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY -- THIS BOOK IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!! Seriously someone published this guy? The book was a bunch of antidotes that didn't deserve the page space that they received. There was maybe a small nuance of a point but it was so minor that it wasn't really a point at all. This is highway robbery. I wish desperately I could get a refund. I read about 50 books a year and this is hands down the most horrible waste of time and worst book I have ever read!!

B000PFUAO6|4.0|I think this is one of DT's best albums they have put out but you simply cannnot compare or expect this album to be another early 90's images and words album thats been done with. These guys will not go back to making another images and words album weather the fans like it or not because they changed for the better.<br />Ok now for my review this album was not really as bad as the whiners say it is, It has 6 songs but very long songs and I guess my only complaint is the lack of vocals in every song (if thats correct) but the music was top notch with neoclassical style guitars from john petrucci and wizard style key boards from jordan rudess makes this album worthy for every true DT fan.<br /><br />Overall I rate it 4 stars!
B000002IGV|4.0|This one is a must have.  I listened to this hundreds of times when I was a kid.  For me though it's a little like Quiet Riot's Metal Health.  My least favorite songs on the Stay Hungry disc are the two big hits \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\".  They are decent songs but kind of too over the top for me.  I understand these are what made the band and album make it but they dumb down what I think is a great rock/metal album otherwise.  Everyone who claims to be a rocker or metalhead needs this album.  Listen to the whole thing, not just the two big hits.  The album has more substance than it is given credit for.  Just my two cents, I give this a solid 4 out of 5.

B0036EBARO|3.0|Seventh Tree, Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory's fourth album, was a bit of a detour from the glossy, `80s pop sheen of their last couple of records, drawing more from Brian Eno-inspired soundscapes, nature, and pagan worship than your typical electro-diva effort. Predictably, it also sold less than Goldfrapp's previous work, so it should come as little surprise that their fifth album returns unabashedly to the roots of Goldfrapp's [financial] success. I could say that Head First combines the up-tempo, synth-heavy electronic dance of Supernature and Black Cherry with some of the ambient, folkier sounds of their superb debut and Seventh Tree, but that sort of mixture is more often the exception rather than the rule. No, Head First rather brazenly throws everything to the wind and kneels to its glam-pop influences without an ounce of shame.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is catchy as hell. Gregory has always shined brightest when the beats bumping behind Goldfrapp's airy vocals are pulsating, oscillating glimmers of sound, usually making liberal use of bass and space-age synthesizers. One listen to \\"Believer\\" will have that chorus stuck in your head for days, and while jams like \\"Alive\\" and \\"I Wanna Life\\" are so disco, so shiny and slick that it almost feels wrong to listen to them without dusting off a polyester pantsuit and platform shoes, there's something refreshing and exhilarating about such straightforward retro pop. There are plenty of synthesizers and effects, but it enhances rather than obscures Goldfrapp's inviting voice, and many of the hooks here, particularly the dark, glitchy rhythm of \\"Shiny and Warm,\\" blow away most current Top 40 material.<br /><br />That's hardly an excuse, however, for just how dated some of the sounds come off. Lead single \\"Rocket\\" is the perfect example: just the kind of smart, toe-tapping songwriting one has come to expect from Goldfrapp and Gregory, but trapped under the weight of synths that sound as if they came straight off the rack at your local Sam Ash, circa 1984. Perhaps that was the sound Goldfrapp was going for, but on too many songs here the effect comes off as cheap, dated, and more than a little off-putting. It also causes much of Head First to bleed together, resulting in something like the ninth circle of hell for those who hate John Hughes movies.<br /><br />Luckily, the duo mixes it up enough as the record winds down to prevent any sugar overdose. There's a Seventh Tree throwback on the haunting, vaguely threatening \\"Hunt,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Shiny and Warm\\" tops most of the earlier, more immediately accessible dance tunes. Closer \\"Voicething,\\" meanwhile, is such a 180-degree shift in sound and mood that it's as if Goldfrapp had just thrown her hands up in the studio and said, \\"Well, **** it, I like everything we did on Felt Mountain better.\\" It's surprising how relaxing and revitalizing the continued layering of Goldfrapp's many soft whispers and murmurs can sound on top of the record's most restrained beats, and it's a near revelation in just how versatile Goldfrapp can be after the nonstop party that precedes it. Head First is nothing if not a party album, especially if said party has a retro theme, and on that count Goldfrapp have outdone themselves once again. But where Seventh Tree was inconsistent, Head First suffers from a lack of much of any substance, and even the occasional toss into left field is notable only for its extrinsic nature.

B000E5N62U|2.0|Let me make this short, I have played this CD twice, and am very disappointed. The songs sound like they were churned out by rote, and not written with a concept theme. There is no spirit to this collection of songs; It lacks the wit, innovation and thoughtful mood creation of Steely Dan's early releases like \\"The Royal Scam\\", \\"Pretzel Logic\\" \\"Gaucho\\", even the rough hewed and uneven \\"Can't Buy a Thrill\\" Fagan's 'The NightFly\\" is far superior. The musicanship of \\"Morph\\" is first rate, but does not carry this album. Finally, the title is dumb. Donald Fagan needs to regroup.
0393072231|5.0|It's hard to conceive of a book more informative, entertaining and timely than The Big Short. Ignore the one star ratings from people who are angry that it's not yet available on Kindle - those ratings don't apply to the book's content.     From the first page, this book reads like a fast-paced thriller, complete with complex characters, unforeseen twists and turns and diabolical villains. What made it even more compelling for me were the moments of startling clarity where I realized this is not fiction; it is the reality we are still living today.    The only caution I extend is this: if it hasn't already, your heart will turn cold at the mere mention of \\"Wall Street\\" after reading this book.
B00007LTIC|4.0|I had previously heard cuts from this album on FM, but never owned either the LP or first issued CD. My favorite YES issues are \\"Close to Edge\\" and \\"The Yes Album.\\" I saw the group in concert several times. I need to play this CD more times to get a true read on its quality. Nevertheless, Track one: \\"Going for the One' is glorious in its dynamics and innovation. You can hear the roots of their later albums in this piece. Overall, I think this is a great remastering job, and demontrates to those unfamiliar with Yes, the power and virtuosity of their playing. Surely, years ahead of some of the pretentious and syrupy garbage that passes for music today.
0061438294|5.0|This book basically consists of Navarro explaining the significance behind a few dozen common body-language expressions.  The sections are divided up by body part/area, with all sorts of interesting anecdotes thrown in throughout.     Reading through this book, I was struck by the number of motions I found myself engaging in without even realizing--e.g., 'pacifying' myself, displaying high or low confidence, etc.  And every time I found myself engaging in the behavior, I found that I was feeling the emotion that Navarro described as well.  Truly eye-opening.    This book is useful not only to learn how to analyze and understand others, but also to transmit positive and confident body displays yourself.  Looking vulnerable or insecure is never a good idea, and once you know what behavior displays those feelings, it's easy to prevent them.    I highly recommend this book, and look forward to reading Navarro's next.

B00005K9LM|4.0|I love this album from Priest.  The riffs on here are wicked.  \\"Freewheel Burning\\" is one of their best openers, it really gets the album going.  \\"The Sentinel\\" and \\"Night Comes Down\\" in my opinion are two of the greatest Priest songs, and they both always seem to never get mentioned very often by Priest fans.  The downside to this album is at the middle it falls apart for a couple tracks.  \\"Love Bites\\" is laughably bad and \\"Eat Me Alive\\" is absolute filler.  As a whole it is quite strong, and I could say something good about the rest of the tracks that I didn't speak of.  This is the essential 80's Priest album.  Make sure you get all their seventies offerings as well.
0792843584|3.0|I never knew what reviewers were saying about a poor transfer from film to DVD until I watched this DVD. They must have used a poor quality print to transfer to DVD, as more than 50% of the film is nearly all brownish. The wonderful roller skating scene is ruined in the middle by a nearly sepia print. The transition between one reel and another is jarring, from a brownish color to more full color. The quality after the \\"Intermission\\" is full of tape edits and blue dots on the print. I know there is a better quality print out there: I saw it on Turner Classic Movies!  Let's hope someone uses what TCM used and makes a Blu-Ray.
B000002J03|5.0|This is one of my favorite Zeppelin albums, but in reality everything they did until Houses of the Holy is absolutely essential.  Who doesn't love the solo to \\"Whole Lotta Love\\"?  \\"Heartbreaker\\" is one of the absolute iconic riffs of all time.  \\"Moby Dick\\" is a great showcase of one of the most important drummers in rock music ever.  It is almost hard to talk about Zeppelin because you almost feel like everyone already knows everything about them, they are just great music no matter what genre you prefer.
B0002EXH40|4.0|After \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" Dave and company realized that they were onto something with that formula and decided to take it to the next level.  In my opinion they once again succeeded at creating another great album.  \\"Reckoning Day\\" is a monster of a riff.  \\"Addicted to Chaos\\" might just be one of the most underrated gems in the entire Megadeth catalog.  There is much to sink your teeth into on here.  This was the last truly great Megadeth album and it is about time it is at least recognized as such.
B002PEP4HI|4.0|I bought this book as part of a book study. I had never read one of Mitch Albom's books before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I did enjoy the book and liked how the author paralleled the two different lives. The book made me stop and think as I was reading, which is always a good thing. I recommend this book.

0743298039|5.0|I do a LOT of reading and love authors like Alice Hoffman and Carol Goodman, Wally Lamb, and Nicole Krauss just to name a few. I must say that I can't wait for Diane Setterfield to publish more novels akin to this one. It is absolutely one of my top ten favorites and I have already purchased copies as gifts for friends. You'll find that you lose yourself in the characters and the beautifully detailed settings. The story stays with you and the end makes you want to go back to the beginning and start reading it all over again.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|My husband and I watched this Documentary Film from our Time Warner Cable Pay-Per-View over the weekend. My husband and I LOVED THIS FILM!  Michael Jackson, SUPERB and looking healthier and happier than we can remember seeing him!  What a WONDERFUL Tribute to the Legacy of the KING OF POP, for his three children to remember Michael, their father, as the KING OF POP! We had to buy this DVD. Michael WAS in the PRIME of HIS LIFE and his death will forever be a tragedy but we THANK THE LORD for sharing Michael with all the World for 51 years! I will miss him more than my husband, who is 5 years younger than me. I am 6 months younger than Michael and grew up with the Jackson 5 and ALL OF THEIR GLORY. MICHAEL JACKSON WILL ALWAYS BE ALIVE IN MY HEART AND HE IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ENTERTAINER THAT EVER LIVED. And thanks to modern technology, we have all those great years on tape, rather video or audio! GOD BLESS YOU MICHAEL, AND YOUR CHILDREN, BE PROUD, HE WAS A DECENT AND GOOD MAN! THE HEAVENS HAVE NEVER SOUNDED SWEETER THAN WITH MICHAEL, THE KING OF POP AND ELVIS PRESLEY, THE KING OF ROCK!
B002UNMWAG|1.0|My wife and I were eagerly waiting for this to be released and finally watched it, or part of it, a few nights ago.  After thoroughly enjoying the original, we lasted only 15-20 minutes through this weak excuse of a sequel.  No stars would have been a better rating.  VERY disappointed.

B000002H92|2.0|To all of you devoted Doors fans out there, this is written tongue in cheek.  I have been a fan of the Doors since I first began listening to them on AM radio when I was in high school.  I have continued to listen to their music for more than 40 years as I do not think that there have been many individuals or groups since that time that have been as talented or creative.  I have never thought that any of the Doors individually were great muscicians.  As a group however they were incomparable, except maybe with the Jefferson Airplane, their contemporaries from the same time.  The live performances of the Doors on this recording are a big step down from the studio work (ie, Light My Fire).  What I do like about the live sets is the antics and unpredictability of Morrison.  Often I thought the music seemed uninspired.  Some of the performances remind me of some of Morrison's writings.  His behavior and presence on these recordings are reminiscent of what is described in some of the books later published about the Doors.  Don't get me wrong...if they were still together performing today I would go see them.  There was an energy and a mystery that no other performers could evoke like the Doors.  I have listened to this several times...and then I remember the day that 'Back Door Man' came alive for me, cruising down the highway on a sunny day with the windows down.
B001HN694K|3.0|I was not too excited about the upcoming 3D adaptation - continuation of the classical books by the English Math Professor known to the world as Lewis Carroll about the adventures of a young girl named Alice in the Wonder/Under-land. I consider the best adaptation of the book, the closest to its spirit directed by Jan Svankmajer in 1988. I went to see Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton in 3D because I remembered how wonderful it was to see Avatar few months ago in 3D. The 3D features in Alice are nice addition to the film, and I would never say that the Burton's film is not beautiful, and the Wonderland he creates is not magical and entertaining but I felt that something was missing. I wanted to be amazed, fascinated, to be changed constantly like Alice herself but it did not happen. While watching the film I was thinking, oh, it is so much like The Wizard of Oz for 21st Century - the Good Witch, the Wicked Witch, and the brave girl who returns to the world she visited once and can't forget. Then, during the final battle Alice transforms into a Jean of Arc - like warrior with the magic sword in the shining arms. The story of the grown up Alice that bookends the Wonderland visions seems to be written to make Alice who is not a child but a 19 years old in the film, an inspirational young woman, the early feminist. It's been a long time since I read fabulously twisted Carroll's stories but as far as I remember, their charm is in the captivating words games, in the unexplained and extraordinary strange situations and deliciously absurd characters. It is also in the ability to look on the same event from totally different perspective. Just remember how many times and how suddenly and instantly Alice changes her size and perception of unreal reality. Tim Burton and his screenwriter tried to give some logic and explanation to the world of dreams, fantasy and absurdity. As a result, the film turned into another version of the struggle between good and evil, which closely resembles the story of the girl named Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. I felt like in the struggle between Tim Burton, a highly creative, imaginative Artist who is at his best while producing the dark visions, and the Disney studio that financed the film, there is no convincing victory. For the film that was made to include the young children as the target audience, Alice is too dark, complex, and scary. For the older viewers open to any complexity coming from the union of Burton and Carroll made in the cinematic haven, the film is strangely dull, slow, and boring. It could be easily described by one simple equation, Barton + Disney = Cheshire cat without a smile. It is really strange because the production values of the film are very high, and the actors enjoy playing weird and creepy characters. It was pleasure to see Johnny Depp as a Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous big-headed Red Queen but I think that Crispin Glover deserves special mention as the Knave of Hearts, the personal assassin to the Red Queen and her confidant.<br /><br />I don't regret seeing Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland at the theater but next time I want to see the cinematic equivalent of the Carroll's book, I'd pull from the shelf DVD Jan Svankmajer's Alice which is still my favorite Carroll's adaptationosely resembles the story of the girl named Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz.

0735619670|5.0|This is one of the best books on Software Construction I've ever read. If you wanna name yourself a good software engineer, you better have this book in your shelf and it better shows some wearing :-)    Seriously, I thought that I'm a good programmer and software constructor, and I still think I am. BUT this book offers some insights into why you are doing things the way you do and how to do them best. It covers nearly all possible topics of software construction, but also takes into account a lot of maintenance issues, and this is one of the points which make this book special.    This book is highly recommended to all Software Engineering/Informatics students and also all selfmade-programmers. Instead of finding some things out for yourself (in painful night sessions) better read this book and follow the suggestions McConnell gives. And if you call yourself an experienced programmer, use the checklists provided by the book to make sure that you really didn't forget something.

B002UNMWAG|4.0|In 2000, \\"The Boondock Saints\\" which was written and directed by Troy Duffy received a limited release in only five theaters in one week.  Critically panned, one would think the film would fade to obscurity.  But this was not the case.  Similar to Kevin Smith's \\"Clerks\\", \\"The Boondock Saints\\" amassed a huge underground following and had become a cult film grossing $50 million in domestic video sales.<br /><br />The first film revolved around three Catholic Irish anti-heroes - Poppa (played by Bill Connolly) and his two fraternal twin sons Connor (played by Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (played by Norman Reedus) MacManus who are vigilantes that take on the Russian mafia with their way and their style of vigilante payback.<br /><br />A decade later, with the popularity of the first film, \\"The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day\\" is backed by Sony Pictures and given a nationwide theatrical release in 67 theaters and due to fan demand, more cities were added to the release.  Once again, the critics were not so supportive of the film but yet the fans have once again come to support the film and the film made over $10 million in the box office but now Blu-ray and DVD release will be unleashed to the masses and I have no doubt that once again, \\"The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day\\" is going to do well.<br /><br />In \\"The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day\\", eight years have passed and after the three men murdered Giuseppe \\"Papa Joe\\" Yakavetta (and countless members of the mafia).<br /><br />When a priest was murdered, someone tries to frame the Saints and now the police (especially the Saint's friends on the inside) are worried that the Saints who have been quiet are back to cause more mayhem.  The public is still divided on their feelings towards the Saints.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Saints are called in for their help and to avenge the death of the priest.  As the two travel back to the U.S. by boat, a man named Romeo (played by Clifton Collins Jr.) who has idolized the Saints wants to be part of their crew and needless to say, he has to earn his place amongst the group.<br /><br />As for the police, Greenly (played by Bob Marley), Duffy (played by Brian Mahoney) and Dolly (David Ferry) worry that their friends may be back and with the FBI sending one of their top investigators named Eunice (played by Julie Benz) to assist them, they worry that the FBI may find out that the three detectives assisted the Saints back then.  Eunice is not only intelligent and sexy (easily catching the attention of the three detectives) but she can easily come up in her mind of what happens at a crime scene plus she's also known to be very good with her gun as well.<br /><br />While the Saints look for who killed the priest, the FBI and police looking for the Saints, the media hype has attracted the attention of Conzezio Yakavetta (played by Judd Nelson) who wants revenge for the Saints murdering his father on public television.  So, once again, the Yakavetta family are planning to get their revenge against the Saints.<br /><br />Who will end up victorious?<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Cinematography by Miroslaw Baszak did a pretty solid job with the overall shots.  The action sequences are well-done, enjoyed the lighting of several of the sequences.  Those well-lighted scenes are vibrant while certain scenes are cold and bluish.  I didn't notice any artifacts, nor did I notice any DNR.  The picture quality has a fine layer of grian, blacks are nice and deep and overall, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment did a solid job in terms of picture quality for the Blu-ray release.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day\\" is presented in English, French (Par) and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As expected with a film that features guns ablazing, the film does feature a good amount of surround channel usagewith the gun shots and bullets zipping through the air.<br /><br />For the most part, dialogue and music is front channel driven but the action sequences definitely put your surround channels to good use and there is also some use of LFE as well.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day\\" comes with the following special features in Standard and High Definition with English Stereo and optional Spanish and Portuguese subtitles:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary with writer/director Troy Duffy, Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus and Billy Connolly - An entertaining commentary by Troy Duffy and the main cast discussing the film and just having fun discussing the film.<br />  * Audio Commentary with writer/director Troy Duffy and Willem Dafoe - Interesting commentary since Willem Dafoe is not seen throughout the majority in the film but it's like listening to two friends having a discussion while watching the film.  But they do touch upon the messed up treatment from the first film and how things were much better in the sequel.<br />  * Deleted Scenes - Featuring two deleted scenes: Detectives Mourn Death and Romeo Plays Chess<br />  * Unprecedented Access: Behind-the-Scenes Featurette - (25:49) Behind-the-scenes of the making of the film and the director, producer and talent talk about working on this second film.<br />  * Billy Connolly & Troy Duffy: Unedited - (9:22) Troy Duffy and Bill Connolly hanging out and Troy explaining how he wanted Bill to become Don and more.

Yes, there is a storyline but for those expecting something deep are probably not going to find it in this sequel.  The performances of the talent may seem off at times and I'm sure many will have issues with the Irish and the Southern accents used by the talents.<br /><br />If anything, I expected nothing butan action-packed film featuring a lot of gun fighting, plenty of action and profanity but I really enjoyed the addition of Clifton Collins Jr. as Romeo and Julie Benz as Eunice.  Collins brings the comedy portion with his character and Julie Benz brings the sexiness.  And both characters definitely kick ass!<br /><br />The Blu-ray release is absolutely fantastic although I can see some fans who have not upgraded to Blu-ray being a bit upset that the Comic-Con featurette (and two other featurettes) are only Blu-ray exclusives but as this is a Sony Pictures  film and there is a move by the industry towards Blu-ray and Blu-ray exclusives not featured on a normal DVD release are to be expected.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day\\" was an enjoyable action-based film.

1591843162|5.0|I loved this book so much, I wrote Seth personally:    Dear Seth,    When you wrote Permission Marketing, it inspired me to leave the Newspaper industry.  I actually met you while working for ExactTarget when you spoke at their annual conference.  Shel Israel's Naked Conversations inspired me to blog.  I helped Chris Baggott start Compendium Blogware a couple years ago (I loved your comment that most corporate blogs suck - I'm trying to change that with my book, \\"Corporate Blogging for Dummies\\" in August).      I left Compendium (still a shareholder) and started my own agency about 6 months ago.  I left a great salary, benefits, a great company, the inner investor circle... and started a company with no cash.  I'm a single father of a son at IUPUI (who is blazing a trail as a Mathemetician) and a daughter in high school.      Everyone thought I was nuts.    I didn't want my kids to see me work a cubicle for the rest of my life.  As I read Linchpin, it reinforced all the decisions I've made... and at 41 years old it wasn't too late. I have 3 large clients already because I'm honest, passionate, and love to share my gifts.  I got a book deal.  All after I quit.  I'm happier than I've ever been and making enough money that I recently paid off my credit cards.  Now I'm shopping for benefits and will be providing them (100%) to my first employee - who starts Monday.    I just finished Linchpin this morning.  Thank you for writing such an amazing book.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|Walt Disney films have been known for their 2D, hand-drawn animated films for nearly a century but within the last decade, there has been more of a focus on CG animated films.  With the last 2D film from Disney being \\"Home on the Range\\" back in 2004, Disney talents wanted to work on a film to bring back the hand-drawn animated style and the film is titled \\"The Princess and the Frog\\".<br /><br />The 49th animated feature film, the film is directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, known for their work in \\"The Little Mermaid\\", \\"Aladdin\\" and \\"Hercules and features music composed by Randy Newman.<br /><br />\\"The Princess and the Frog\\" which was budgeted at $105 million was released back during the Thanksgiving holiday week and was quite successful, earning $246 million worldwide and was nominated for eight Annie Awards and also three Academy Awards.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />With what we have seen from Disney when it comes to animation in the past decade, they have set the bar quite high in terms of animation and especially within the past several years of what one can expect from a Blu-ray release.  When you have a good number of significant animators from Disney working on this film, you're going to expect quality and nothing less than that.  Fortunately, they deliver with this beautiful, vibrant film.<br /><br />\\"The Princess and the Frog\\" just boasts of wonderful colors and impressive detail for its artistic backgrounds.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:781 aspect ratio), we see the details from the plants, the tree trunks in the swamp area, the beautiful surroundings of the La Bouff mansion and beautiful detail in terms of the character's movements.  I personally didn't see any artifacting or edge enhancement during this film.  Overall, Disney has once again gave us a film that looks magnificent on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Princess and the Frog\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and also French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital. It seems like it's been quite a long while, but the film boasts an exciting musical with fun and entertaining jazz music courtesy of Randy Newman and musicians.  Dialogue and music are crystal clear from the front and center channels and a good amount of surround use and LFE for the more dominant action scenes.  Every character has its share of contributing to the soundscape with Tiana and Prince Naveen hopping through the swamp, Ray buzzing through the air and Louis jamming on that trumpet. And of course, any scene that features a crowd is nicely heard through the surrounds.  A good dose of musical and action scenes that keeps the soundscape quite immersive.<br /><br />Overall, magnificent lossless audio for \\"The Princess and the Frog\\".<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Princess and the Frog\\" comes with a few special features presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1), audio in English 5.1 Dolby Digital with English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.

It's also one of the most modern animated films from Disney as the female lead is not wanting to become a princess, nor is she looking for her knight in shining armor.  Tiana is an independent, hard working woman who wants to start her own restaurant and she wants to become a business owner.  She's an intelligent character and for the most part, I also enjoyed that Disney has created an African-American, female lead character for this film.<br /><br />Also, I found it quite exciting to see Disney return to its hand-drawn animated roots.  Not to say that I'm not enjoying the CG animation from Disney/Pixar but it was great to see John Lasseter and team working together in bringing those magical and music Disney hand-drawn animated films back.  Using today's modern technology and today's animators, they were able to create a film that just looks magnificent and also a soundtrack that is just incredible, fun and energetic.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, this is a solid release as you get an awesome Blu-ray filled with special features but also included is the DVD of the feature film and also a digital copy that works great during those long commutes (and also to keep the children busy).<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" once again achieves another masterpiece and creating a film that will no doubt become a classic.

0345314522|5.0|[[ASIN:0345314522 The Mists of Avalon-Trade]]   This book arrived within the time alloted.  Very pleased. It has been a very good read - into the lst 100 pages. Thank you!
B0030IIZ56|5.0|In November 1999, the sequel \\"Toy Story 2\\" was released in theaters and the $90 million dollar film like its predecessor did extremely well in the domestic and worldwide box office making over $485 million.<br /><br />What is interesting was that the film was originally not intended for a theatrical sequel but a direct-to-video release.  When Disney execs were pleased with the results, Pixar Animation Studio staff literally were on overdrive as they had only 8 months to finish the film, when the usual animated film by the company takes four years.  Needless to say that while the making of the film was stressful and even some the film's animator's suffering repetitive stress injuries for working nearly 40-straight hours (rarely any sleep) shifts, the company made what was impossible...possible.<br /><br />And now with a third film to be released in the Summer of 2010, 11-years-later, both \\"Toy Story\\" 1 and 2 films will be released on Blu-ray.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Toy Story 2\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The first thing one will notice (especially after watching \\"Toy Story 1\\") is how much detail is included in \\"Toy Story 2\\" (and after watching the special features, you'll see how much have improved over a decade later with the sneak peak of \\"Toy Story 3\\").<br /><br />For the most part, \\"Toy Story 2\\" has improved animated-wide by including much more detail and textures as seen during the close-ups of Mr. Potato Head (you can see the texture as you would see from the actual toy), the plastic covering on the package of Stinky Pete, the detail of Rex the Dinosaur, more shading and the scenery of the outdoors, from vehicles to the store, the trees, the ground and everything you can think of, looks much better than its counterpart.<br /><br />And of course, on Blu-ray, you see the detail and the amazing clarity.  Colors are absolutely vibrant,  you can see details and textures which come alive on HD and for an animated film that came out in 1999, even over a decade later, this animated film looks much, much better than a few of the animated TV shows and films that we today.<br /><br />Also, the movements of the characters are just well-animated.  From the characters of \\"Woody's Roundup\\" dancing, the toys and their walking movements.  The movements were very good on the first film but they improved on it for the sequel.  Very impressive.<br /><br />Overall, wonderful picture quality for this sequel.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Toy Story 2 \\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Maser Audio and English 2.0 DTS-HD, English DVS 2.0 Dolby, Spanish and French Dolby Digital EX and I was amazed by the lossless audio quality for the first film on Blu-ray but for this sequel.  WOW!  Lossless audio is amazing.  Just the first few minutes of the beginning of \\"Toy Story 2' as we see the Buzz Lightyear video game sequence, we are treated with an immersive soundscape with the center, front and surround channels being utilized as well as LFE.  The film has a good amount of action sequences as Buzz Lightyear #1 takes on Buzz Lightyear #2 along with Emperor Zurg.  We hear the Cheetos snap when Woody steps on them and much more.<br /><br />Sound is crystal clear and overall, another impressive lossless soundtrack.<br /><br />As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Toy Story 2' includes the following special features:<br /><br />  * Characters: An Exclusive Sneak Peek At Toy Story 3 - (4:00) A sneak peek at the new characters and the talent voicing the new characters for \\"Toy Story 3'.<br />  * Director Commentary<br />  * Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs:<br />  o Episode Two: International Space Station - (3:43) Buzz reports back about his adventure to the International Space Station.<br />  * Paths to Pixar: Technical Artists - (4:24) In this series of shorts, Pixar artists talk about their career path and share advice to aspiring filmmakers and animators.<br />  * Studio Stories: A series of amusing anecdotal shorts about life at Pixar.<br />  o \\"Toy Story 2 Sleep Deprivation Lab\\" - (1:25) This short featurette gives audiences an inside peek into the intense time pressures under which the Toy Story 2 editors found themselves.<br />  o \\"Studio Stories: Pinocchio\\" - (2:15) This short featurette shows an impromptu competition between the animators to decorate their workspace by throwing toys into the ceiling.<br />  o \\"Studio Stories: The Movie Vanishes\\" - (2:32) This short featurette tells how a mischievous technical error almost erased all of Toy Story 2 from the computer system.<br />  * Pixar's Zoetrope - (1:58) A look at the creation of the live-action zoetrope that Pixar created to capture the principles of animation in a live sculpture.<br />  * Celebrating our Friend Joe Ranft - (12:46) A tribute to beloved Disney and Pixar story man Joe Ranft, regarded as one of the industry's most gifted story artists.<br />  * Making Toy Story 2 - (8:10)  A featurette on the making of the film, talking with director John Lasseter, crew and talent.<br />  * John Lasseter Profile - (3:02)  Crew and talent talk about working with John Lasseter.<br />  * Cast of Characters - (3:28)  A featurette on how the talent bring the characters to life and the new talent who provide the voices for the characters of  \\"Toy Story 2'.<br />  * Toy Box -  This section features outtakes (5:27), Jessie's Gag (1:00), Who's the Coolest Toy (3:19), Riders in the Sky Music Medley (3:11) and autographed pictures (:45).<br />  * Deleted Scenes - (4:11) Featuring deleted animation intro (:47), Godzilla Rex (1:28) and Crossing the Road (1:56).<br />  * Design - A featurette on the design of each character (Galleries), the 3D-Visualization and the colorization of the characters.<br />  * Production -  Featuring Designing Woody's Past (2:50), Making Woody's Roundup (1:51), Production Tour (2:31), Early Animation Tests (3:04), Special Effects (1:38) and International Scene (1:47).<br />  * Music & Sound - Featuring Designing Sound (5:38), Making the Songs (3:25), Woody's Roundup\\" Music Video (2:17) and \\"Jessie's Song\\" Randy Newman Video (2:48).<br />  * Publicity - Featuring Character Interviews (2:05), Trailers (3:24), TV Spots (2:12), Posters (:50) and Baseball Woody (:18).<br /><br />EXTRA:<br /><br />Included in the \\"Toy Story 2\\" Special Edition is a DVD of \\"Toy Story. The DVD is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 16×9 Televisions and is in English 5.1 EX with English SDH subtitles.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Having gone crazy for the Blu-ray release of \\"Toy Story 1\\", I can easily say that this Blu-ray release for the sequel is equally impressive and a title definitely worth owning and worth having in your Blu-ray collection.<br /><br />Although, I enjoyed the storyline for the first film much more, I enjoyed the second film because of the additional characters and the animation showed great improvement nearly five years after the first was made.  But since the release of the film on VHS and on DVD (multiple times), I have owned each release because these films are both magnificent.<br /><br />The voice talent and acting is top notch, the storyline is well-written and Pixar Animation Studios set the bar higher then and they continue to set the bar higher now when it comes to CG animated films.<br /><br />And so far, every Pixar Animation Studio release on Blu-ray have been nothing short of magnificent.  From the Blu-ray releases of \\"A Bug's Life\\" and \\"Monster's Inc.\\" (and yes, we are still waiting for that Blu-ray release of \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"The Incredibles\\") and their releases from \\"Cars\\" all the way up to their 2009 film \\"Up\\", when it comes to new releases that are Pixar related, so far we have been given awesome picture quality, awesome lossless audio and plenty of special features.  \\"Toy Story\\" 1 and 2 are among those films that just look and sound fantastic but alsoadditional content to keep any animation fan happy.<br /><br />I will say that if you own the \\"Ultimate Toy Box Set\\" that was released in 1999, you will want to hang on to that set because although the Blu-ray's do have new additional content, a lot of content from the Ultimate Toy Box Set are NOT included on the Blu-ray release.<br /><br />\\"Toy Story 2\\" is just an enjoyable family film that holds up well today, over a decade later and will still produce plenty of laughs and even in today's world of awesome CG animation, you can't help but see this vibrant film and just enjoy it on so many levels.  Just seeing the detail and texture and how much the film had improve within the last five years from the original film is incredible.  And the fact that the employees busted their heart and soul to get this film done in eight months vs. the usual four years is equally impressive.<br /><br />With the release of both special edition \\"Toy Story\\" films on Blu-ray, these are the definitive versions of the film to own and for those like myself who have owned several versions of \\"Toy Story\\", the upgrade to Blu-ray is definitely well worth it and highly recommended!\\" Music Video (2:17) and \\"Jessie's Song\\" Randy Newman Video (2:48).      * Publicity - Featuring Character Interviews (2:05), Trailers (3:24), TV Spots (2:12), Posters (:50) and Baseball Woody (:18).

B0030IIYWA|5.0|When it comes to animated classics, \\"Toy Story\\" is definitely one title that is among a great group of titles.  Also, it was the first film for the CGI animation company Pixar, who would become the tour-de-force of creating animated CGI hits such as \\"A Bug's Life\\", \\"Cars\\", \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", \\"Finding Nemo\\", \\"The Incredibles\\", \\"Up\\", \\"Wall-E\\" to name a few.<br /><br />And set for launch on June 18, 2010 is \\"Toy Story 3\\" and to celebrate the upcoming film, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment will be releasing \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"Toy Story 2\\" on Blu-ray.<br /><br />The first \\"Toy Story\\" was co-written and directed by animator and Pixar Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter who has worked with Disney since 1983 with \\"Mickey's Christmas Carol\\" and co-written by Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft.<br /><br />Released in 1995, \\"Toy Story\\" was a major success as the $30 million dollar film went on to make over $361 million worldwide.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Toy Story\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  For a film that was created back in 1995, \\"Toy Story\\" still looks beautiful on Blu-ray.  Sure, the detail is nowhere near what we see on the \\"Toy Story 3' teaser (included on the special features) but the film just looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  For example, seeing the detail that was made for Rex the Tyrannosaurus, to the threading of the chairs, the vibrant colors of the film, the detail of the road and again, even for a film that is 15-years-old, it still rivals a few of the CG animated film and TV shows that we see in the present.  The film looks absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Toy Story\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Maser Audio and English 2.0 DTS-HD, English DVS 2.0 Dolby, Spanish and French Dolby Digital EX.  And again, for a 15-year-old film, \\"Toy Story\\" sounds magnificent on lossless.  From dialogue and Randy Newman's music coming from the front and center channels, surround and rear surround channels for the effects and LFE during the booms.  Audiophiles will be pleased that the lossless audio is quite immersive.  So, expect scenes such as Sid blowing up his action figures, the rocket on Buzz's back ignited, fallen toys and toys being scattered and much more.  I was very impressed by the lossless audio.<br /><br />As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Toy Story\\" includes the following special features:<br /><br />  * The Story: An Exclusive Sneak Peek at Toy Story 3 - (2:02) In this short featurette, \\"Toy Story 3' director Lee Unkrich introduces viewers to new characters that will appear on the third film and the all star cast voicing the new characters.<br />  * Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs:<br />  o Episode One: Blast Off - (3:27) Buzz reports back about his adventure to the International Space Station.<br />  * Paths to Pixar: Artists - (4:49) In this series of shorts, Pixar artists talk about their career path and share advice to aspiring filmmakers and animators.<br />  * Studio Stories: A series of amusing anecdotal shorts about life at Pixar.<br />  o \\"John's Car\\" - (1:27) A short story that recounts how Toy Story director John Lasseter refused to stop driving his beat-up car even after the film's success.<br />  o \\"Baby AJ\\" - (1:38) A short story that tells the hilarious story of how important Halloween is to the Pixar team and how one Pixar employee dressed up as the over-sized baby from the short Tin Toy to win a prize.<br />  o \\"Scooter Races\\" - (2:16) A short story which takes the audience on a rousing scooter race around the studio with John Lasseter and other employees.<br />  * Buzz Takes Manhattan - (2:13) Spectacular footage from Buzz Lightyear's premiere as a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon.<br />  * Black Friday: The Toy Story You Never Saw - (7:34) The Toy Story filmmakers discuss the early cut of the film that very nearly shut down production entirely.<br />  *Filmmakers Reflect - (16:35) A special feature shot in 2005 with the filmmakers John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft talking about their experiences working on the film.<br />  * Making Toy Story - (20:17) Filmmaker looking back at their characters and ideas used for making the film, the making of the film from design, movements and more.<br />  * The Legacy of Toy Story - (11:42) Filmmaker, critics, stars talk about why \\"Toy Story\\" succeeded and their thoughts when they watched the film.<br />  * Designing Toy Story - (6:12) Animators, character designers, story artists, painters, etc. talk about designing for \\"Toy Story\\".<br />  * Deleted Scenes - (9:50) Ten deleted scenes.<br />  * Design - Featuring Character Galleries (4:05), 3-D Visualization (5:41) and Color featurettes (7:54).<br />  * Story - (13:56) Various story and Film comparisons.<br />  * Production - (13:41) Discussion on production tour, layout tricks, animation tour, multi-language reel.<br />  * Music and Sound - Featuring the music video for \\"You Got a Friend in Me\\" (2:15), Designing sound (6:35) and Randy Newman videos.<br />  * Publicity - (10:46) Character interviews, trailers, TV spots and more.<br /><br />EXTRA:<br /><br />Included in the \\"Toy Story\\" Special Edition is a DVD of \\"Toy Story.  The DVD is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 16×9 Televisions and is in English 5.1 EX with English SDH subtitles.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Toy Story\\" is one of those films that is just a must-own in whichever format its released in and now that it will be available on Blu-ray, \\"Toy Story: Special Edition\\" is definitely worth it. I was impressed by how this 15-year-old film looks on Blu-ray and how much of the detail still pops out today.  As mentioned earlier, despite its age, it still looks better than a few CG animated TV shows and even some films that were released in the last five years.<br /><br />Everything about this film still holds up today.  The CG animation, the voice acting is fantastic and overall story is well-written.<br /><br />\\"Toy Story\\" is where the Pixar magic all began.  This film catapulted Pixar Animation Studios as the most well-known animation studio in the planet and since then, every film created has been successful domestically and worldwide.<br /><br />I know for many owners of the previous DVD release, one must wonder why must they upgrade again.  It all comes down to picture and audio quality.  And like most Pixar Blu-ray releases, this special edition Blu-ray release is full of special features.  This Blu-ray release is a no-brainer, in fact, you want to own both \\"Toy Story\\" BD releases because they are both quite worth it and watching it on HD was much better of an experience than I expected.<br /><br />I will say that if you own the \\"Ultimate Toy Box Set\\" that was released in 1999, you will want to hang on to that set because although the Blu-ray's do have new additional content, a lot of content from the Ultimate Toy Box Set are NOT included on the Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Granted, I know this will be a bummer for many, but the picture quality and the audio quality is so much better on the Blu-ray release plus you get new additional content.  So, the Blu-rays are definitely worth owning.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Toy Story: Special Edition\\" is a fantastic film and because it is a pretty impressive upgrade, the Blu-ray release is the definitive version to own at this time.  Definitely recommended!ete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft talking about their experiences working on the film.      * Making Toy Story - (20:17) Filmmaker looking back at their characters and ideas used for making the film, the making of the film from design, movements and more.      * The Legacy of Toy Story - (11:42) Filmmaker, critics, stars talk about why \\"Toy Story\\" succeeded and their thoughts when they watched the film.      * Designing Toy Story - (6:12) Animators, character designers, story artists, painters, etc. talk about designing for \\"Toy Story\\".      * Deleted Scenes - (9:50) Ten deleted scenes.      * Design - Featuring Character Galleries (4:05), 3-D Visualization (5:41) and Color featurettes (7:54).      * Story - (13:56) Various story and Film comparisons.      * Production - (13:41) Discussion on production tour, layout tricks, animation tour, multi-language reel.      * Music and Sound - Featuring the music video for \\"You Got a Friend in Me\\" (2:15), Designing sound (6:35) and Randy Newman videos.      * Publicity - (10:46) Character interviews, trailers, TV spots and more.

I was impressed by how this 15-year-old film looks on Blu-ray and how much of the detail still pops out today.  As mentioned earlier, despite its age, it still looks better than a few CG animated TV shows and even some films that were released in the last five years.    Everything about this film still holds up today.  The CG animation, the voice acting is fantastic and overall story is well-written.    \\"Toy Story\\" is where the Pixar magic all began.  This film catapulted Pixar Animation Studios as the most well-known animation studio in the planet and since then, every film created has been successful domestically and worldwide.    I know for many owners of the previous DVD release, one must wonder why must they upgrade again.  It all comes down to picture and audio quality.  And like most Pixar Blu-ray releases, this special edition Blu-ray release is full of special features.   This Blu-ray release is a no-brainer, in fact, you want to own both \\"Toy Story\\" BD releases because they are both quite worth it and watching it on HD was much better of an experience than I expected.    I will say that if you own the \\"Ultimate Toy Box Set\\" that was released in 1999, you will want to hang on to that set because although the Blu-ray's do have new additional content, a lot of content from the Ultimate Toy Box Set are NOT included on the Blu-ray release.    Granted, I know this will be a bummer for many, but the picture quality and the audio quality is so much better on the Blu-ray release plus you get new additional content.  So, the Blu-rays are definitely worth owning.    Overall, \\"Toy Story: Special Edition\\" is a fantastic film and because it is a pretty impressive upgrade, the Blu-ray release is the definitive version to own at this time.  Definitely recommended!

I had to go back and read the 1421 to continue the saga. Service from this vendor was excellent as well. I got the book in three days and it was in excellent condition.
1593081308|5.0|In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.<br /><br />But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.<br /><br />Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.<br /><br />Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.<br /><br />And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.<br /><br />As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.<br /><br />And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.<br /><br />Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.<br /><br />Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece.powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets.

B00375LMHK|4.0|I've always been a huge fan of massive series. Having read Glen Cooks \\"The Black Company\\"  nearly a year or so ago, I wanted once again to take on a huge feat and once again jump into another mega series. I chose Steve Erikson's Books of Malazan series. Having read a very positive review from Mr. Cook himself I decided to give it a chance. WHAT WAS I THINKING !!!!      Upon arrival, I saw the huge glossary that was within the book and I got a bit nervous. Characters upon character names. I thought to myself \\"Wow, can this book really contain them all and the most important question, will it hold my attention?\\" I soldiered on, and found that it actually did.       Inside this book is a massive world based heavily on political and godlike beings. All seeking out their own agendas. While no actual character had the \\"main character\\" headline, I found it interesting hop scotching between characters ever other page. It makes for a dazzling read I might add as opposed to a one sided point of view from a character.      What I found awesome was that Mr. Erikson gets straight to the point in this novel. He doesn't spend countless moments detaling every single thing surrounding our character at that moment. Everything has its purpose; The Story. Other series i have reviewed had me losing my mind about character outfits, temples, markets and such. This like i mentioned just now GOT TO THE POINT.      Great start to a new series i am about to delve into. I already have the next four books in line to read. MY ONLY COMPLAINT ? This book in large print. I found that so irriating. Its dimensions were 9 inches in length. I prefer the 6.8 diamater length. If that is my only flaw with the book than, well, thats not really a story line flaw but a publisher flaw. Anyways. Thanks for reading!
B003CN5B6K|4.0|I don't think I've ever quite heard of a show quite like \\"White Collar,\\" a clever new mystery show in which the FBI decides to employ a brilliant criminal to help them bust other \\"white collar\\" criminals. While it has an intriguing new twist on the odd-couple cop show, it also has brilliantly witty writing, a murky conspiracy within the FBI, and some excellent actors with plenty of chemistry -- and it promises to get even better.<br /><br />While searching for a thief known as the Dutchman, FBI agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) hears that gentleman thief/conman/counterfeiter Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer)-- who he put in prison -- has escaped, only to allow himself to be recaptured. Caffrey is desperate to find his girlfriend Kate, and so he makes Burke an offer: free him from prison, and he'll help him catch the Dutchman.<br /><br />Though he's dubious about Neal, Peter reluctantly agrees. After only a few hours out, Neal has a new wardrobe, a luxurious apartment and a wealthy landlady who doesn't care that he's a former thief. And he's working for the FBI.<br /><br />Together, the odd partners tackle a bunch of tricky white-collar cases: data hidden in a designer dress, a priceless Bible stolen from a mobster, a painting with a dodgy trail, smuggled Iraqi artifacts, clashes with Interpol in Chinatown, a jewel robbery, infiltrating Wall Street, real estate fraud, an illegal organ-trafficking ring, priceless wine bottles, and a kidnapper who is gunning for Neal. And as Neal tries to unravel the clues that Kate has left him, he and Peter become entangled in a shadowy conspiracy within the FBI...<br /><br />The first season of \\"White Collar\\" is a lot like Neal Caffrey -- elegant, smart and charming, to the point where you don't really care that it has some painfully unrealistic moments (trotting their only witness onto a rooftop party with the KILLER nearby?), and a few slow spots. Fortunately, the writers seem to be smoothing the lumps out.<br /><br />And the writers have a knack for winding together the one-off cases with an overarcing plot about a corrupt FBI agent who is conspiring against Neal and Peter. There's plenty of hilarious dialogue (\\"It's a loft, seized in a DEA bust -- fifteen hundred square feet, service elevator. It's perfect!\\" \\"Is that a chalk outline?\\" \\"I'm sure they've cleaned that up by now\\") and suspenseful little scenes where Neal and/or Mozzie disguise themselves to infiltrate secure places where the FBI can't go without a warrant.<br /><br />But the show's heart is DeKay and Bomer. DeKay is a snappy, sharp-edged FBI agent who is willing to bend the rules to get the job done, and respects Neal more than he'll admit. And Bomer is a sort of 21st-century Remington Steele: boyishly handsome, clever, charming, refined, and a little bit rakish. At the same time, you really feel sorry for him because of the loss of Kate, and the hints that she may be in on the plot against him.<br /><br />There's also a solid supporting cast -- Tiffani Thiessen as Peter's loving, long-suffering wife, and Willie Garson as the hilarious Mozzie (\\"I just said that to a guy who enjoys killing people with his bare hands!\\"). Also good performances by Diahann Carroll and Noah Emmerich.<br /><br />It sounds like just another odd-couple cop show, but \\"White Collar Season 1\\" has the benefit of excellent writing, acting and some grippingly suspenseful plots.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|We love this series and enjoy the humor that is involved.  We are excited for when season two comes out.
B0036EBARO|3.0|I've given up on trying to figure out what signature sound Goldfrapp is going to embrace next -- they've gone for quirky electronica, robotic club dance, and delicate airy pop. So what do they do in \\"Head First\\"? Well, they've drifted back into dance territory, except that this brand of electronica is saturated in retro beats and swooshes.<br /><br />The sound of a blast-off heralds \\"Rocket,\\" a bouncy synthpop tune full of random tinkles and squidgy keyboard melodies. \\"Ooh oh oh, I got a rocket/oh oh oh, you're going on it/oh oh oh, you're never comin' back!\\" Goldfrapp sings gleefully in the middle of the song.<br /><br />Things get a bit more downtempo in \\"Believer,\\" in which the melody flows swiftly around the stacatto beats. And after that, we get a steady stream of bouncy, colorful synthpop that reeks of the 80s -- the icy vocal core of \\"Alive's\\" flittery pop anthem, the hard dancy flavor of \\"Dreaming,\\" the delicate nighttime prettiness of the titular track.<br /><br />The one thing I really, REALLY couldn't stomach: \\"I Wanna Life,\\" a perky pop song that sounds like it was cribbed from a bad eighties musical. But there are also some interesting inclusions that are hard to classify -- they introduce a twisting electronic soundscapes of \\"Hunt,\\" where Alison's vocals play second fiddle to the music. And the final song \\"Voicething\\" lives up to its title, dispensing with typical vocals, and instead embracing a ghostly eerie exploration of sound.<br /><br />\\"Head First\\" is definitely not Goldfrapp's best work -- it's fluffy, radio-friendly pop music that only occasionally takes a twist into the unknown. In fact, it's kind of weird to have a band that has done so much cutting-edge music go back to eighties synthpop -- it's completely soaked in that 80s vibe (much like M83's \\"Saturdays = Youth\\"), and it left me wondering, \\"... is that it? They don't have anything new here? It's so... predictable.\\"<br /><br />For the record: the music is not bad, just predictable and relatively lightweight (compared to the brilliant \\"Black Cherry,\\" \\"Felt Mountain\\" or \\"Seventh Tree\\"). Heated dance beats, shimmering layers, and undulating swathes of synth that buzzes, tinkles and whooshes like a spacebound rocket. And they dabble in some darker, more experimental songs in the second half, especially in \\"Voicething\\" -- it's a musical synth journey that drifts from one plateau to the next.<br /><br />Alison Goldfrapp's beautifully chilly voice adds a distinctive sound to the album -- and she does some wonderfully weird stuff, like an entire song filled with inarticulate noises. No words at all. And the lyrics are sometimes even more vivid than the music: \\"Look at the trees in the dark/bending like a bony finger/Cry for the face on a little moon by the tree...\\"<br /><br />\\"Head First\\" is a sleek, warm synthpop album that reeks of nostalgia, but that nostalgia also bogs it down -- it lacks the magical brilliance of Goldfrapp's prior works.e brilliant \\"Black Cherry,\\" \\"Felt Mountain\\" or \\"Seventh Tree\\").

B001GKJ2FW|4.0|I love this movie. So what if all the adult actors look far beyond their 40's, which is the range of the Mother's age in that stage musical! Meryl Streep along with Julie Walters and Christine Baranski clearly make up for poor Pierce Brosnan. Heck, who ever said he could sing? I don't care about that bit even. I love Pierce and he can do no wrong! Granted I do have to sort of cover my ears when I'm watching the movie and he's singing...but so what. He took the role to work with Meryl and, after all, who wouldn't? If you have the chance, catch the stage musical! However, if you can't afford a trip to New York, then grab a copy of the film, which is the next best thing. This is a delightful movie to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon with a vintage bottle of wine with some crackers and dip!
B00328G4V6|5.0|One of my biggest complaints about Hendrix's recordings is their mediocre audio quality.  Even the best recordings seem to have poor dynamic range and muddy treble.<br /><br />Not so on Valleys of Neptune.  Kudos to McDermott and the post production team here.  It sounds like it was recorded yesterday.<br /><br />As for the songs, they range from mediocre revisits of Hendrix's experimental psychedelic vocals on Electric Ladyland, to riveting guitar work, to roots rhythm and blues numbers.  The Title Track is not as gratifying as the hype around the album might suggest, but it's also a forty year old experimental number.  I expect that even the lowest points on the album will grow on me, much as his others have, with repeated listens - much as one learns to admire a friend or lover, even the imperfections.  And the high points of the album grow on you immediately as you progress through the tracks... peaking with \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" and \\"Lover Man,\\" and never letting you down after that, either.<br /><br />I really appreciated the sleeve insert, with the photos and McDermott's notes that give a glimpse into the creative process for Hendrix, Redding, and Mitchell.  It's rare to find anything beyond the CD and a track list inside a CD case anymore.<br /><br />Add to that the sheer awe of the time capsule nature of the album, and it's already a treasure in my collection, imperfections and all.
B003CNQPNS|4.0|It's about time they finally released this short-lived 13-episode high-tech drama out on DVD about a former motorcycle cop & former amateur dirt-bike racer named Jesse Mach(Rex Smith)who was secretly chosen to test a top-secret project-all terrain attack supercycle capable of speeds up to 300 MPH that even outclassed the Knight 2000 on KNIGHT RIDER after Jesse got injured in the line-of-duty & lost his police partner(Marty)in the process just like Michael Knight(David Hasselhoff)lost his police partner Muncie(Herbert Jefferson, Jr.)in-the-line-of-duty on his last police investigation.<br /><br />Backing the supercycle was a computerized command system that allowed its operator to provide the supercycle's rider with real-time information from various sources & to autopilot the Street Hawk motorcycle during its high-speed runs after clearing traffic along the intended route and had weaponry like AIRWOLF had that KNIGHT RIDER didn't even have either which even made KITT look pale by comparison, especially since KNIGHT RIDER started getting overshadowed by STREET HAWK during its short-run on ABC since KNIGHT RIDER lost a lot of viewers thru STREET HAWK since STREET HAWK stole KNIGHT RIDER's thunder & Jesse stole &#34;The Man The Machine&#34; motto away from Michael Knight(David Hasselhoff)among many other things, despite the rumor that STREET HAWK was a rip-off of KNIGHT RIDER.<br /><br />Norman Tuttle(Joe Regalbuto)who was an engineer employed by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration of the Department of Justice, was the designer of the Street Hawk supercycle & reluctantly chose Jesse to test it out which contributed to Jesse living a double-life as a public relations officer from the fictional Metropolitan Police Dept. in L.A. in the daytime & anonymous crime-fighter at night-time kind of like the ornery deputy director Michael Archangel(Alex Cord)provided the reclusive Vietnam veteran Stringfellow Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent)and his faithful one and only pal since Nam Dominic Santini(Ernest Borgnine)protection in exchange for flying missions of national importance for the FIRM.<br /><br />Additionally, STREET HAWK was originally scheduled to premiere in the Fall of 1984 on Mondays at 8PM, but then ABC had changed their minds when the short-lived Summer series from 1984 CALL TO GLORY did well & STREET HAWK was delayed to mid-season which resulted in STREET HAWK making its debut in the Winter of 1985 at 9PM on Friday nights instead, but then STREET HAWK flopped after only 2 months since it was already apparent that they weren't going to have a 2nd Season underway for the Fall of 1985 since this show wasn't getting the ratings that ABC wanted, despite the fact that STREET HAWK had developed a cult fan base like KNIGHT RIDER and AIRWOLF did since STREET HAWK was an instant smash when it premiered on ABC for the very first time on Friday January 4, 1985 and seemed to be more popular than AIRWOLF and KNIGHT RIDER were, despite the fact that STREET HAWK didn't even last since STREET HAWK hit a speed-bump all of the sudden by the Spring of 1985 since people were perhaps getting bored with watching too much of the same thing every weekend like another reviewer stated about this supercycle series since STREET HAWK was too similar to KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF along with the fact that ABC had STREET HAWK on every Friday night, CBS already had AIRWOLF every Saturday night, and NBC already had KNIGHT RIDER every Sunday night giving people too much competition & redundancy, despite the fact that STREET HAWK had stole KNIGHT RIDER's thunder during this shows brief run along with the fact that the creation of STREET HAWK was inspired by the creation and premiere of both KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF, especially KNIGHT RIDER which also inspired the creation of AIRWOLF.<br /><br />In addition to what helped lead to this shows abrupt cancellation; STREET HAWK's 9PM time-slot on ABC conflicted with DALLAS's 9PM time-slot on CBS every Friday night alongwith the fact that STREET HAWK premiered too soon after AIRWOLF and KNIGHT RIDER both did too since this show debuted only a year later after AIRWOLF did and 2 1/2 years later after KNIGHT RIDER did since STREET HAWK made its debut on ABC in the Winter of 1985, AIRWOLF made its debut on CBS in the Winter of 1984, and KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982, along with the fact that STREET HAWK was more expensive to produce than AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER were.<br /><br />Therefore STREET HAWK was outlasted by both AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER and perhaps started overshadowing STREET HAWK and after the &#34;Murder Is A Novel Idea&#34; episode of this show was shown on ABC on Thursday March 7, 1985 was a good sign that this show wasn't going in the right direction & that the next episode wasn't going to be shown until 2 months later since STREET HAWK was already cancelled in mid-March of 1985 after only 10 weeks of being on ABC, but then ABC had brought STREET HAWK back on the air temporarily in May of 1985 to finish off STREET HAWKs remaining last 3 episodes of this short-lived series before ABC had cancelled STREET HAWK permanently in the Summer of 1985 when KNIGHT RIDERs 4th Season was underway for the Autumn of 1985 on NBC & while AIRWOLFs 3rd Season was in the works for September of 1985 on CBS which was very similar to what CBS did with THE INCREDIBLE HULK in it's last season after it's 4-year run on CBS since THE INCREDIBLE HULK was cancelled all of the sudden in the middle of the Hulks 5th Season on such short-notice in mid November of 1981 despite its strong ratings, due to budget cuts and a change in management at CBS which contributed to the Hulk's 1981-82 Season being only half a season with only 7 episodes in the can, but CBS had cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK after its 5th 1981-1982 Season episode which was the &#34;Triangle&#34; episode which original air-date was Friday November 13th, 1982; but then CBS brought the Hulk back on the air temporarilyin the Spring of 1982 to finish off its remaining last 2 episodes in May of 1982 which were &#34;Slaves&#34; and then &#34;A Minor Problem&#34; and then CBS axed THE INCREDIBLE HULK permanently in June of 1982.<br /><br />STREET HAWK was also the bomb on Friday nights in the Winter of 1985 just like KNIGHT RIDER was the bomb on Friday nights from the Fall of 1982 thru the Summer of 1983, especially since STREET HAWK had K.O'd KNIGHT RIDER in the ratings, but on the other hand this show had its share of problems, flaws, & disadvantages too like KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF did since STREET HAWK's rider didn't have total control of the STREET HAWK supercycle as opposed to the Knight 2000 & the Airwolf superchopper since Mach always needed Norman's help in controlling it while on a mission which also makes you wonder how was STREET HAWK able to never accidently hit anything in its way while hitting hyperthrust mode, but unlike Mach, Michael mostly had control of KITT & Hawke mostly had control of AIRWOLF aka &#34;The Lady&#34; along with the fact that STREET HAWKs disadvantages were often overlooked & overshadowed by the disadvantages that Airwolf & the Knight 2000 had on top of that, especially since STREET HAWK practically beat KNIGHT RIDER to a pulp.<br /><br />In addition to what made this show an over-the-top smash, STREET HAWK was the hybrid of KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF since STREET HAWK was like a cross between AIRWOLF and KNIGHT RIDER with its supercycle spectacular capabilities that KNIGHT RIDER and AIRWOLF both had & didn't even have, despite the fact that STREET HAWK wasn't as successful or as everlasting as AIRWOLF or KNIGHT RIDER were since STREET HAWK didn't even last since it bit the dust after only 2 months.<br /><br />Overall, I still like KNIGHT RIDER the best out of AIRWOLF, STREET HAWK, and KNIGHT RIDER and I like AIRWOLF the 2nd best out of the following 3 too along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER was the most successful and longest lasting of those 3 Universal Television high-tech futuristic dramas.<br /><br />STREET HAWK also had some interesting guest stars like<br />*George Clooney in the &#34;A Second Self&#34; episode before he was even a star, especially before his co-starring days on E.R.<br /><br />*Bernard White in &#34;The Adjustor&#34; episode before his co-starring days as homicide detective(Sgt.

Vince Novelli) on MATT HOUSTON<br /><br />*Belinda Montgomery in the &#34;Murder Is A Novel Idea&#34; episode during her co-starring days as Crockett's ex-wife(Caroline)on MIAMI VICE<br /><br />The bonus feature also tells us about the experience & joys Rex Smith, Jeannie Wilson, & Joe Regalbuto of doing STREET HAWK & how they ran this show by using at least 5 different motorcycles and quite a few stuntmen in Jesse Mach's black STREET HAWK outfit to do the stunts just like they used at least 4 Trans Ams to do the series KNIGHT RIDER since they had to use a stripped down version & model of the STREET HAWK motorcycle for a stuntbike to do the jumps and leaps just like they had to use a stripped down version of the Knight 2000 Trans Am for the stunt cars to do all the impressive stunts on KNIGHT RIDER by using a stripped down version of the '82 Pontiac Trans Am.<br /><br />Additionally, the bonus feature explains how this show ended up being axed even though its ratings seemed high enough to kick off a 2nd Season in the Fall of 1985, but somehow I think STREET HAWK would've ended up lasting longer for at least a 2nd Season if STREET HAWK made its debut in September of 1984 instead of January of 1985 since STREET HAWK was the biggest smash on prime-time since KNIGHT RIDER back then & was an even bigger smash than AIRWOLF was too which reminds me that I think the producers of this show had to give Rex Smith's characters last name as Mach instead of Hawk even though this shows title was STREET HAWK due to the fact that Jan-Michael Vincent already had the last name Hawke for his character on AIRWOLF which debuted the year before STREET HAWK did.<br /><br />Therefore you could say that STREET HAWK was one of the most popular short-lived classic TV shows of all times, at least from the 1980's along with the fact that STREET HAWK was the biggest high-tech phenomenom on TV since KNIGHT RIDER back then.<br /><br />Something else that I noticed about STREET HAWK is even though there was an episode when a deadly laser rifle was used and stolen in which was the &#34;Hot Target&#34; episode, this show never had an episode with STREET HAWK being shot at and disarmed by a laser as opposed to the episodes on KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF where Michael(David Hasselhoff)and Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent)were sent on a mission involving stolen lethal laser rifles like the &#34;Knight Strike&#34; & &#34;Knight & Knerd&#34; episodes of KNIGHT RIDER and like the &#34;Annie Oakley&#34; episode of AIRWOLF which resulted in Airwolf & KITT being temporarily damaged, disabled, short-circuited, and/or weakened leaving the Knight 2000 and Airwolf barely being able to function and solve their missions at the end, but I guess the producers felt that STREET HAWK was worthless battling a laser & would've made Mach(Rex Smith) a lot less protected & a lot more prone to being hit by the laser rifle than Hawke & Michael were which would've resulted in STREET HAWK getting burned or short-circuited & even more damaged than KNIGHT RIDER or AIRWOLF did when they got hit by a laser and/or the producers of STREET HAWK just simply didn't make enough episodes to show an episode like that since this show didn't even last as opposed to KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF.<br /><br />The thing that sucks about this STREET HAWK DVD box set is it doesn't provide any Closed Captioning mode on it to display the subtitles on the screen in case you have difficulty understanding what they say plus this DVD box set doesn't even posts the original air-dates to any of the episodes either, unlike Universal did with KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF & all the other DVD's made by Universal, which I suspect is perhaps due to todays sluggish economy, but I hope somehow that Universal re-releases STREET HAWK on DVD in order to provide the Closed Captioning & subtitles that KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF have on theirs, especially in DVD mode which would be awesome.<br /><br />For instance, the original air-dates & titles to each STREET HAWK episode on ABC were<br />1/4/85-THE PILOT EPISODE<br />1/11/85-A SECOND SELF<br />1/18/85-THE ADJUSTOR<br />1/25/85-VEGAS RUN<br />2/1/85-DOG EAT DOG<br />2/8/85-FIRE ON THE WING<br />2/15/85-CHINATOWN MEMORIES<br />2/22/85-THE UNSINKABLE 453<br />3/1/85-HOT TARGET<br />3/8/85-MURDER IS A NOVEL IDEA<br />5/2/85-THE ARABIAN<br />5/9/85-FEMALE OF THE SPECIES<br />5/16/85-FOLLOW THE YELLOW GOLD ROAD(aka Final Episode)<br /><br />So now that Shout has STREET HAWK in the works to be released on DVD this Summer, I'm hoping to see other classic favorites released on DVD soon like CHiPs-Season 3 and MATT HOUSTON-Season 2.<br /><br />In the meantime, I'm really looking forward to STREET HAWK being released out on DVD on Tuesday July 13th, 2010.
B003AYZBGQ|5.0|The Big Short's subtitle is \\"inside the doomsday machine\\" but it should have been \\"liars Poker - the consequences\\" as he explains the massive consequences of Wall Street bond investment banks' utter incompetence.  Lewis tells the tale in his usual cinematic, fast-paced way.  He masterfully uses the perfect amount of detail to paint the picture is peerless.     Lewis opens his tale with the perfect quote from Tolstoy:    \\"The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.\\"  Like many situations in Wall Street, the \\"experts\\" know so much and are so deeply involved in what they are doing that they cannot see the forest for the trees. During the subprime debacle, it must have been nearly impossible for a bond trader to concede to himself that there was something wrong with giving $750,000 loans to migrant Mexican berry pickers making $15,000 per year. In a culture where most consider the size of their bonus proportional to their own brains, the hubris of these overpaid scoundrels was stratospheric.  When the whole thing goes down in flames, Lewis writes \\"For more than twenty years, the bond market's complexity had helped the Wall Street bond trader to deceive the Wall Street customer.  It was now leading the bond trader to deceive himself.\\"    The result is the big investment banks, led by incompetent CEOs, allowed their high and mid-level employees in the bond departments to lose billions of dollars and escape financially unscathed while taxpayers picked up the tab.  Low income borrowers were complicit primarily in their lack of sophistication.  By getting the criminally incompetent ratings agencies to call all of these poor quality loans AAA, the investment banks created huge bonuses for themselves.  When the music stopped playing, every major investment bank had billions of losses because they had started to believe their own bulls---.  Meanwhile, the US government assessed the costs to the taxpayers by handing the banks a gift of billions of dollars, without reforming the system in any way.     Michael Lewis' tale centers on a handful of smart investors who saw what was happening and had the foresight to bet against these fools.  Even the winners dealt with horrible unintended consequences.    The \\"heroes\\" of this story are the brilliant investors, mainly a rag-tag band of Wall Street outsiders, who made common sense statements like \\"A Home without Equity is Just a rental with debt.\\"  They were naturally skeptical in their dealings with Wall Street, asking their salesmen \\"I appreciate this trade, but I just want to know one thing: How are you going to f--- me?\\"        These investors knew that investing could not be reduced to a formula.  One of them was a one-eyed man with Asperger's, Dr. Michael Burry.  He said \\"the more he studied Buffett, the less he thought Buffett could be copied; indeed, the lesson of Buffett was to succeed in a spectacular fashion you had to be spectacularly unusual.  I love this quote from Burry: \\"If you are going to be a great investor, you have to fit the style to who you are.\\"  Investing is something you have to learn how to do on your own, in your own peculiar way.    The irony of his success is that the troubled genius Burry earned his clients a fortune, beating the S&P by a massive margin, for ungrateful clients. Instead, he was hassled because his subprime short took almost 2 years to play out - which was exactly what he said would happen.  He was able to beat the market indices by impossibly wide margins, all from a small office in California, far from Wall Street, mainly by reading detailed company filings from a 10-K service that cost only $100 per year.  His style wasn't an easy ride, as his typical trade \\"goes up by ten times but first it goes down byhalf.\\"       There is much to learn from this remarkable man, including his thought process on communicating his investment ideas.  He said: \\"I hated discussing ideas with investors because I then become a Defender of the Idea, and that influences your thought process.\\"  In his first five years running money, the S&P was down 6.84% and in the same period, he was up 242%.  He assumed investors trusted him enough to let him invest the way he wanted - but that was wrong.    After the subprime mess did indeed explode, he had more than doubled his clients' money that final year of his fund. At the end of the whole ride, his founding investor Gotham Capital pulled their money out of his fund.  He sent them an unsolicited email that said only \\"you're welcome.\\"   By June 30, 2008, any investor who had stuck with Berry from his beginning on Nov 1, 2000, had gained 489% after fees, while the S&P 500 returned only 2% during the same time.  In 2007 alone, Burry had made his investors $750 million, yet due to redemptions, he ended up managing only $600 million.       Lewis writes: \\"What had happened was that he had been right, the world had been wrong, and the world hated him for it.\\"    Michael Lewis accurate descriptions of the sleazy bond salesmen on Wall Street appear to be hyperbole but are instead spot-on. Anyone that has met these creatures will instantly recall real-world examples that look and sound exactly as he describes them.     Lewis writes of the perils for investors of buying this mortgage-backed paper: \\"An investor who went from the stock market to the bond market was like a small, furry creature raised on an island without predators removed to a pit of pythons.\\"  \\"The bond market customer lived in perpetual fear of what he didn't know.\\"  (I worked at a hedge fund for a few years that was routinely sodomized by a sleazebag bond salesman.  Finally, at one point, I could no longer be in the same room with him when he pitched his ideas to the fund's principals, because I couldn't stand to watch the rape in progress - it was like watching a snuff film).    The physical description of one of the bond traders that copied Burry's idea of shorting this paper was perfect: \\"He wore his hair slicked back, in the manner of Gordon Gekko, and the sideburns long, in the fashion of an 1820s Romantic composer or a 1970s porn star.  He wore loud ties, and said outrageous things without the slightest apparent awareness of how they might sound if repeated unsympathetically.  He peppered his conversation with cryptic references to how much money he made...\\"  \\"He was a walking embodiment of the bond market, which is to say he was put on earth to screw the customer.\\"     One of my favorite passages in the book is how Lewis describes a meeting in Vegas between the loser/patsy/criminally stupid Wing Chau, who is buying the CDOs (bad loans) in size and Eisman, one of the hedge fund guys who has taken the other side of the bet.  The boob Wing Chau earns millions by \\"managing\\" CDOs, which is another way of saying buying any and all that Wall Street creates.  He says with condescension: \\"I love guys like you who short my market.  Without you, I don't have anything to buy.  The more excited that you get that you're right, the more trades you'll do, and the more trades you do, the more product for me.\\"  Eisman later grabs the bond salesman that put the meeting together and says, \\"Whatever that guy is buying, I want to short it.\\"  Of course, Wing Chau's is proven to be completely wrong, but like everyone in the right place in this debacle, he emerges unscathed with millions in bonus money.    Some of the most delicious quotes by Lewis in this book have been well reported already, but bear repeating:     On the subject of John Paulson, a hedge fund manager that ended up making billions of dollars shorting the subprime garbage created by Wall Street.  A quote by a Goldman Sachs client:  \\"I called Goldman Sachs to ask them about Paulson, they told me he wasa third-rate hedge fund guy who didn't know what he was talking about.\\"     One of the hedge fund managers said this to the CEO of Moody's, who claimed his company's ratings were correct: \\"With all due respect, sir, you're delusional.\\"     After a meeting with Ken Lewis, CEO of Bank of America: \\"I was sitting there listening to him. I had an epiphany.  I said to myself, Oh my God, he's dumb!  A light bulb went off.  The guy running one of the biggest banks in the world is dumb!\\"     Then, about Merrill Lynch: \\"We just shorted Merrill Lynch.\\"  \\"Why?\\" \\"We have a simple thesis.  There is going to be a calamity, and whenever there is a calamity, Merrill is there.\\"  (This turned out to be true, and ironically, Merrill sold themselves to said \\"dummy\\" Ken Lewis of Bank of America)     When fighting about values of CDOs broke out and Deustche Bank demanded collateral from another bank: \\"Dude, f--- your model.  I'll make you a market.  They are 70 to 77.  You have three choices.  You can sell them back to me at 70.  You can buy some more at 77. Or you can give me my f------ $1.2 billion.\\"       Maybe the best quote of the entire book, is Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack responding to a question on an earnings call.  He was asked how just one little desk on the bond floor could have lost $8 billion.  He said: \\"One, this trade was recognized and entered into our accounts.  Two, it was entered into our risk management system.  It's very simple.  When these got, it's simple, it's very painful, so I'm not being glib.  When these guys stress loss the scenario on putting on this position, they did not envision... that we could have this degree of default, right.  It is fair to say that our risk management division did not stress those losses as well.  It's just simple as that.  Those are big fat tail risks that caught us hard, right.  That's what happened.\\"  This type of verbal diarrhea is commonplace on earnings calls.     Michael Lewis writes some statements that I love:    \\"The BigWall Street firms, seemingly so shrewd and self-interested, had somehow become the dumb money.  The people who ran them did not understand their own business, and their regulators obviously knew even less.\\"     \\"What are the odds that people will make smart decisions about money if they don't need to make smart decisions - if they can get rich making dumb decisions? The incentives on Wall Street were all wrong: they're still all wrong.\\"     \\"No investment bank owned by its employees would have leveraged itself 35:1, or bought and held $50 billion in mezzanine CDOs.\\"    \\"The people in a position to resolve the financial crisis were of course, the very same people who had failed to foresee it: Henry Paulson, Tim Geithner, Ben Bernanke, Lloyd Blankfein, John Mack, and Vikram Pandit....\\"     \\"All shared a distinction: they had proven far less capable of grasping basic truths in the heart of the U.S. financial system than a one-eyed money manager with Asperger's syndrome.\\"       \\"The $306 billion (TARP) guarantee, nearly 2% of US GDP - was presented undisguised, as a gift.  By early 2009 the risks and losses associated with more than a trillion dollars' worth of bad investments were transferred from big Wall Street firms to the U.S. taxpayer.\\"    \\"The problem wasn't that Lehman Brothers had been allowed to fail.  The problem was that Lehman Brothers had been allowed to succeed (in the first place)\\"     \\"This new regime - free money for capitalists, free markets for everyone else - plus the more or less instant rewriting of financial history vexed all sorts of people...\\"    He ties the whole story up so elegantly, with a quote from Gutfreund, the original bond trader, the first villain of \\"Liar's Poker\\" who says:     \\"It's laissez-faire until you get in deep sh--.\\"
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Mumford & Sons is an incredible collection of folk, story telling, rock and roll, and incredible instruments. It has hints of punk angst and maturity beyond it's time. Listen to the demo and experience just a taste of the incredible lyrics and moving music. Oh, one last thing, these guys are still so new to the music scene that you can see them live for $8-12 per ticket. I'm going to see them at a bar in Solana Beach, CA for $8. Incredible! I feel like we've discovered the next Coldplay!
B0039UTDA6|5.0|Even though many reviewers are giving this product negative review because of Oprah's narration, I think that it is time that someone wrote an honest review about the product.  After watching the first two episodes last night, I must say that this series is simply AMAZING!  The footage was entertaining and educational at the same time.  This is the same reason that Planet Earth has been so successful as well.  When I show the Planet Earth series in the class the kids actually cannot wait to watch it.  They always ask when we are watching it again.  Like Planet Earth, Life tells a great story in every episode and we get to see things that often times we have never seen before.    All those complaining about Oprah being the narrator are missing something.  When my students are watching a series like this, a narrator they can identify with helps them relate to the subject matter even more.  You should see the kids when they realize that the narrator from Planet Earth is from Avatar.  They make the connection, and they can relate to the narrator.  David Attenborough may have more a \\"scientific\\" background than Oprah Winfrey, but my students and many other non-science folk cannot relate to him.  If he were the narrator of this series on Discovery, many might quickly view this as \\"too scientific\\" and move on.  If you don't like her narration, buy the other version.  I'm buying this version to show my students because her voice makes this interesting educational series even more appealing to them.    If you like a great story with great characters, then you need to check out this series.  Words cannot describe how awesome it was to see a \\"Jesus Christ Lizard\\" running across the water, monkeys using rocks as tools, a toad that tenses up its muscles to become \\"pebble-like\\" and roll down a mountain to get away from a predator, or three cheetahs working together to take down an ostrich!  Another fantastic series from BBC and Discovery!!
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Wonderful (disturbing) information--I'll never eat a burger out again. Great motivation to eat healthy. I had one major issue though. Mr Hirshberg (Stonyfield) blamed business & capitalism for the disgusting industrial monopolies and the damage they are doing. Mr Hirshberg, you are a businessman and a capitalist...the wonderful Mr Salatin from Polyface Farms is a businessman and a capitalist. Capitalism is NOT the problem. Greed and corruption are the problem!
B002VWNICW|4.0|I bought the Blu-ray Disc from Amazon.com, and was very happy when I got the film very quickly. On the frontside I read \\"Includes Exclusive Interactive Features Plays on Playstation 3 and Blu-ray Players\\". I have the Playstation 3 and would like download from the BD-Live Center Access the promised even more bonus content.  I hope to see e.g. Deleted Scenes and other interesting features. Now I am so disappointed, because I cannot do that, as BD Live is not available here in Germany, only in US.    The movie and the story, so the actors all too, are my favorite!  Forgive me my terrible English!    Johanna from Germany
B002RML5QM|1.0|I waited and waited and waited on the conclusion of this book it NEVER came.  What a huge waste of time!  He never got to the point.  He explains over and over and over and over and over the same thing.  Yes the brain can rewire itself.  I already knew this.  But HOW is the question what can we do to help our brain rewire itself.  What exact exercises can we use.  HE NEVER ANSWERES THIS QUESTION.  Save your money.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is one handy little sharpening tool.  I keep several of these handy, one in the kitchen, one in the tool box, and one in the emergency kit for touching up cutlery between sharpening.  Two or three swipes with the ceramic stone resets the blade perfectly.  This isn't the tool to use for industrial grade re-sharpening, but to reset the edge quickly this guy can't be beat.  It's size makes it handy to take along on hunting and camping trips as well, stays out of the way until it's needed.  The fold out round stone is also great to have with you when chain sawing wood.  Ever touch the blade into a bit of dirt, or nick a hidden rock?  This will reset the edge on your saw teeth with no fuss, and get you back in business in minutes without ever leaving the log you're working on.

B0036BP6XQ|5.0|This is one of those rare movies with a positive message that can make you laugh and make you cry and keep you riveted from start to finish. I rented this movie and regret that because I'm going to want to see it again and now I'll buy it too. I'm cheap and I buy very few movies but this is one I'll want to see again years from now. And yes, Sandra Bullock was superb.
B002UJIY70|4.0|Cat and mouse games.....who is who....will the real married couple please stand up!  Ok, so the actual story line has been used before.  So what.  What matters here is this movie entertains.  There's enough going on to keep you guessing through out the movie as to whom is whom and what in the heck is going on.  Ok, there are a few predictable parts.  However, there is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat as well.  Nice sick twist at the end to boot.  To some degree once the twist has been learned it sort of takes out the main thrust of this movie...to a point.  Again, it comes down to entertainment value.  This movie keeps the sail raised in that category!

1400063515|5.0|This book really makes one contemplate and doubt his own knowledge.  Taleb's writing style can be, at times, biased and rambling, but he makes up for it with his easy to comprehend explanations of complex concepts.    I strongly recommend this book to literally any one.  It is applicable in so many ways.
1401219268|5.0|Watchmen is a graphic novel but don't let that frighten you. You say \\"oh no, it has pictures, that's kid stuff! I can't be caught reading that!\\" Just relax, we'll get through this. Yes Watchmen has pictures but that doesn't make it any less a novel. In fact, Alan Moore, the primary author or the book, claims that twenty two pages of Watchmen is equal to 135 pages of text, dialogue, and description that he handed in to his collaborator Dave Gibbons. That's about one graphic page for every 6 written pages. If Watchmen were a traditional novel with full descriptions the 419 page book may have been nearly 2000 pages long! Yes, Watchmen is a graphic novel, a comic book. And, yes, Watchmen is about superheroes. But the book explores the superhero genre in a way that questions it and it does so in a very interesting and entertaining way. It defied comic book conventions, depicting very violent people and gritty themes in a time when Batman still had shark repellent on his utility belt. Watchmen explores the basic superhero archetypes from the vigilante adventurer to the near omniscient super powered man. It looks at these characters' codes of justice and tactics and attempts to make sense of them relative to reality. Watchmen asks who among us would really be willing to put on a mask and pursue this brand of justice, and why would a man with god-like abilities bother to fight crime?<br /> Watchmen depicts a set of very basic superhero archetypes; There is the enterprising adventurer, like Batman, or Doc Savage the rich, intellectual idealist who strives for change. The vigilante type like Zorro, the Lone Ranger, or the Punisher with their uncompromising, black and white view of right and wrong.  There's the  femme fatal, enticing criminals into submission. And the super powered man, the benevolent god among us, the superman sent to protect us all. Watchmen shows us these characters set against the backdrop of the cold war, a very real time in our history when the prospect of total destruction was very real. The characters become rounded as the authors shape them and reveals them as people with real issues in this terrifying world. The authors recognize the horror inherent in human nature and the idea that just because a person puts on a mask, they are not exempt from it. Some of the characters are repressed schmoes, others sexual deviants, others are narcissistic, some are just confused, and some are even sociopaths. Watchmen posits that perhaps those who would choose to pull on a mask and a pair of tights and adhere to a strict, black and white idea of justice may not be the best, brightest, most altruistic among us, but could very well be mentally and emotionally unstable. The story suggests that some may even be so obsessed with their code that they may be willing to do horrific things to achieve their idea of what is right. Even when an act of congress attempts to subvert the heroes' obsession with justice, some persist, even grow more determined. One character goes so far as to brutally murder his foes rather than hand them over to authorities and be forced to reveal his identity. Another allies himself with the US government, reveling in the opportunity to feed his hunger for violence and to be payed to do it. Still another uses his status as a former hero to gain wealth and  influence and perhaps use it to reshape society into his image of what it should be, regardless of who or what stands in his way. The authors of Watchmen boldly propose that, yes, superhero crime fighters could exist, but we probably wouldn't want them around if they did.<br /> And what of the super powered god/man? Watchmen's depiction of such a character aims to bring to light the fallacy of the assumption that such a being would naturally fight for \\"truth, justice, and the American way\\". So often, Americans want to believe that god is on our side but would he be? Should he be? Why would a god among us care about our ideas of justice or morality?

Maybe he would grow out of touch with humanity as he begins to feel as though he is no longer a part of it or perhaps never was. In one famous line from the book, a TV program misquotes a prominent physicist as saying in response to this god-like character \\"Superman exists and he's American\\". Later this misquoted character authors an article that is one of several articles that Watchmen's  authors have inserted in-between chapters to further develop the universe that the characters live in. In the character's article he points out the misquote saying \\"What I said was 'God exists and he's American'\\". With this idea firmly in place, Watchmen shows just how our country and its leaders may attempt to exploit such a being, even become dependent on him. With this character, the book is able to illustrate just how dangerous such a situation might be and if a man were given such immense power, a country or even the whole world may be at the mercy of this man and his loyalty or apathy toward humanity.<br /> Watchmen explores the major characters in the world of superhero pulp fiction and attempts to give the reader an idea of the machinations of these archetypes in a real world setting. The book looks at these characters and how they have been grown and shaped out of our ideals. The authors attempt to take a step back and look at these ideals in contrast with human nature. The conclusion seems to be that ideals are nice, but you can't change human nature. And if you could give a man super abilities and change his nature, it would be futile because he would cease to be a man. It is a wonderful read and is every bit as exciting as it is thought provoking. I highly recommend this book for anybody, whether they are fans of the genre or not.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is great, sheath too. (Had an SRK and the plastic sheath stretched and broke, this one won't, built different.) Taped a hex wrench to the sheath and now the hollow handles hold matches and fishooks/line and some foil. I carried it in the Pacific, hollow handle is  waterproof if tightend. If yuo carry a wrench to take off the handles, you can also turn knife into a spear by tying through the handle holes to a big stick. Use a constrictor knot cause the knife is heavy. The stock grips, though not as pretty as the micarta ones, are very, very sturdy so save your money.
0393072231|5.0|Yes, there are other books on the subject.  Yes the analysis and coverage and documentation of the sub-prime mortgage debacle of the 2000s has played out relentlessly for the past few years.  But forget about everything you heard, saw, and read.  Michael Lewis breaks it down from \\"the other side of the trade.\\"  He gives you perspective from all angles, you almost feel like an insider, looking into the window of the rooms where these backroom deals were dreamed up, executed, and sold.  The story captivates you from page one, is unbiased, and masterfully weaves all the stakeholders together into one full bodied work of literature.  If you don't like this book, you simply don't appreciate great storytelling.<br /><br />AND TO ALL YOU KINDLE USERS OUT THERE WHO ARE BASHING THE BOOK BECAUSE IT IS NOT ON THE KINDLE YET: I am a kindle user, have been since day one, and have had/owned all generations of the kindle.  I understand where you're coming from!  But, please, if it is THAT important that you read it now, before the publisher makes it available electronically, BUY THE HARDBACK.  Or get it from the library.  Its simply wrong to bash the artist/author for something that is not entirely in their control.  Think about it.  So pony up, you'll be glad you did.
0141442468|5.0|This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch.

0393072231|5.0|In the run-up to the housing collapse of 2007-2008, houses weren't merely expensive, they were insanely expensive. Yet just when it seemed that prices couldn't go higher, some fool would come along and pay an enormous sum for a glorified hovel. You didn't have to be a genius to realize that American real estate was overvalued. It did, however, take something special to figure out how to make money off the madness. A group of between ten and twenty people did just that, making the bet of a lifetime that author Michael Lewis calls [[ASIN:0393072231 \\"The Big Short\\"]]<br /><br />The cast of characters in Lewis's highly readable chronicle of the collapse (and what led to it) includes a misanthropic former medical resident, a money manager who saw himself as Spider-Man, and a pair of men in their thirties who started with $110,00 in a Schwab account they managed from a backyard shed in Berkeley, California. \\"Each filled a hole,\\" Lewis writes. \\"Each supplied a missing insight, an attitude to risk which, if more prevalent, might have prevented the catastrophe.\\"<br /><br />Ever since he left Salomon Brothers to write [[ASIN:039333869X Liar's Poker]], the classic 1989 account of his years as a bond salesman, Lewis has been waiting for a day of reckoning. Little did he realize that the Wall Street he once knew now seems quaint. By 2007, it had morphed into a financial Frankenstein, a \\"black box\\" filled with hidden risks on complicated bets that could destroy its creators, but only if the government allowed it to do so.<br /><br />The first to figure out how to use the system against itself was a man named Michael Burry, who once described himself in an online personal ad as \\"a medical student with only one eye, an awkward social manner, and $145,000 in student loans.\\" Burry possesses an intellect so unusual that Lewis turns his journey of self-discovery into a fascinating subplot. While working the grueling schedule of a medical resident, Burry started writing about stocks in an online forum. (He also took apart his personal computer and put it back together between 16-hour shifts at Stanford Hospital, prompting his superiors to send him to see a shrink.) When he quit medicine to start the hedge fund Scion Capital, admiring investors tracked him down and gave him money.<br /><br />When Burry started buying insurance in 2005 on nearly two billion dollars' worth of bonds backed by lousy mortgages, his investors thought he had gone nuts and nearly mutinied. But in 2007, when the housing market began to crumble and Burry's bet paid off, everyone realized that his predictions weren't crazy so much as a sane interpretation of a market gone mad.<br /><br />Burry might have set the trade in motion, but he was no salesman. The one who took his idea and ran with it, the \\"Patient Zero\\" of this tale, was a bond salesman at Deutsche Bank named Greg Lippmann, who went around telling everyone he could that the end was near. Only a few took his advice, but most who did became extremely rich. (John Paulson, who made an astounding personal profit of four billion dollars, is the subject of another recent book on the same theme, Gregory Zuckerman's [[ASIN:0385529910 The Greatest Trade Ever]].)<br /><br />The reader can't help but root for this gang of financial renegades as they take on a corrupt and rotten system. Still, The Big Short lacks the pure narrative drive of Lewis' best-selling sports books, [[ASIN:0393324818 Moneyball]] and [[ASIN:039333838X The Blind Side]]. The new work draws its energy from a different source, a palpable undercurrent of anger at the excesses of Wall Street the author shares with his subjects. Lewis is justifiably outraged at the behavior of Wall Street and what its trillion-dollar subprime-mortgage business truly represented: a means of extracting money from the bottom of America's social pyramid and moving it to the top. The problem isn't that Lehman Brothers failed, he shrewdly observes, but that it was allowed to succeed in the first place.<br /><br />Lewis reserves special scorn for the biggest banks. Goldman Sachs was selling large volumes of bonds backed by subprime mortgages and, at the same time, betting against the junk it was peddling. [[ASIN:0393072231 The Big Short]] also tells the little-known tale of how Morgan Stanley allowed a single trader to lose more than $9 billion.<br /><br />It's appalling, but not much has changed. Most Wall Street CEOs who set a course for the iceberg remain in power today. The blind are still leading the blind. At any rate, as Lewis observes, they still can't see things any better than a one-eyed former medical resident.rn for the biggest banks.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|If you are looking at any of the Becker BK&T Knives by Ka-Bar, this is the one to purchase.  This bad boy is a 5.25\\" bundle of big hurt.  The blade is 1/4\\" thick, and the steel is 1095 Cro-Van which has extra Chromium for stain resistance, and extra Vandium for hardness (edge retention).  It is NOT STAINLESS however-but it is a damned good steel.  I suggest going and getting the Micarta scales for it as well.    Great great knife!!!
1439190275|5.0|I'm an Atkins old hand, but I was surprised at how different The New Atkins was from earlier books, in part because it includes the most recent research. It's good to know that Atkins is perfectly safe and can even reduce your risk for cardiovascular disease.    The best thing about this new and easy-to-read book is how flexible it makes the diet. Atkins has never been about eating no carbs, but this book explains which are the best carbs to eat: vegetables, berries, nuts and seeds, and other whole foods. You can pick from more than 80 vegetables from the start and have at least five servings a day.     Big change: You don't have to eat red meat (or any animal products), if you prefer. Check out the vegetarian and vegan versions. You can start in Phase 1 or later if you prefer. There is even a way to avoid the \\"Atkins flu\\" that some people experienced when they started the diet. You also learn what you need to do to avoid weight regain.    I wish I had had this book years ago.
0802798225|3.0|I've sworn to stop reading YA romance a million of times before. Just like adult bodice-rippers, I find the genre too formulaic and predictable. Unfortunately, \\"Perfect Chemistry\\" is no exception.<br /><br />There is really nothing wrong with this book except for its utter unoriginality. This is a story that we all have read before - a rich, popular and beautiful cheerleader and dangerous (but hot) gang member are thrown in together by fate, or, more specifically, a chemistry lab seating chart (I am coming to a conclusion that this is how 99% of high school couples find each other, based on YA literature I've read). The guy makes a bet to get into the virginal cheerleader's pants, and sparks start to fly. Well, you can predict the rest as well as I did.<br /><br />\\"Perfect Chemistry\\" however is not as bad as I might have made it out to be, hence my 3-star rating. It is an extremely engaging and fast read (about 3 hours for me), not overly cute and sweet or dumb as some romances I've read in the past, but not really special either. It doesn't take you anywhere new emotionally or creatively, it is not grounded in reality and relies heavily on physical attraction. The book is just OK, a decent read which I suspect fans of YA romance will enjoy much more than I did.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|This album is exactly that. You should listen to it from start to finish. I like this somewhat better than their last album because it is more tied together.

The thought of paying more for a hard cover book that I don't need to have, that takes days to get to me on a book that I won't know if I like until I read makes no sense.      Kindle gives me instant access, it's price is right (even if I end up hating the book), I don't kill trees, and I don't have a book lingering about that I will more than likely never re-read.

B002UXRH10|5.0|Knowing the Rihanna everyone has seen and heard sice her first album, this album was a suprise to me and a lot of others as well. Rihanna steps up and delivers a dark, haunting, artistic album here, let out the angry side of her personality. And it worked quite well I would say. With standout tracks like \\"Wait Your Turn\\", \\"Russian Roulette\\", \\"Hard\\", and \\"Rockstar 101\\" with Slash of Guns & Roses and Velvet Revolver in tow, Rihanna kicks out an impressive piece of work here. Would definitely recomend this album. Not my usual thing but I found it as an infectious and entertaining deviation from Rihanna's pop good girl persona.
B00328G4V6|3.0|When I first listened to the 30 second clips of this CD it blew my mind how good the recording quality was and I thought, \\"this is going to be great!\\"  Until I listened to the album and the entire thing just sounds over-produced and remixed and really doesn't sound like Jimi.  There's hardly any feedback on his guitar which to me defines the \\"Hendrix sound.\\"    What bothered me to high heavens most is that songs like \\"Lover Man\\" \\"Bleeding Heart\\" \\"Slow Version\\" and \\"Trash Man (best song on the cd)\\" all fade out right in the middle of the jam.  If there's anything I want more from this cd it's to hear Jimi wail and this cd just keeps him in a cage.

Not sure why it got some bad reviews on here... maybe people were expecting some hidden treasure to be found in some ancient Iraqi ruin to add a sufficient level of cheese to it.  This movie was powerful and does a great job reminding us of the dangers the men and women in the military face abroad.
067182449X|5.0|The Diary of Anne Frank is the most poignant story ever told, in my opinion.  I think you can read all the factual books about the horrors of World War II and the holocaust, but Anne Frank's story makes it so personal.  You will fall in love with her spunk and sweetness.  You will hate her oppressors.  Anne dreamed of becoming a famous writer one day, and, sadly, she reached her dream in a way she never imagined.  You must read this book!

I recommend this to everyone. Voices done by many famous stars, you'll reconize many as you hear them. Also a few Star Wars jokes, & James Earl Jones does one of the voices also, the one he is most famous for.

0439023483|4.0|Normally I am not a fan of science fiction novels, I tend to lean towards fantasy. The idea of futuristic worlds tends to zone me out at least in literature. So I shocked myself when I decided to get this book. I had read some of the reviews and thought well its got a lot of wow from people so I thought I would give it a shot. And, man am I glad I did. Not only did it get me to think about societal issues, but I really was left pouring over the last pages eager to learn how it ends. Without giving to much away all I can say about the last chapters, is that it left me saying \\"You have got to be kidding me, that is one twisted world.\\" All in all a exciting read, and if it can make a avid fantasy reader go nuts wanting to read the second book, then it has to be good.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Amazing stories told by a great writer.  Very moving.  Makes one realize how thankful we should be for all that we have.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Absolutely awesome concert - loved the likes of \\"High Water Everywhere\\" with the two drummers and acoustic guitar.  Something about saving the best until last and watching the DVD extra \\"Wake Up Dreaming\\" track - which probably is the most amazing acoustic performance I have ever seen.       One can only imagine how it was to realise a 20 year dream to play the Albert Hall - and it was a flawless performance to be savoured often.
B001FB5634|4.0|Someone asked me if I liked The Road, upon watching it. I had no answer. The Road is just one of those films that is too hard to describe. Is the movie good? Well, yes it is-that is a far easier question to answer. I have read the book and must say that the film really does it justice. It is bleak, dreary, utterly depressing and flawlessly acted.     Viggo Mortensen is a man with no name, who, alone with his son (also no name) is attempting to survive what seems to be some sort of apocalypse. We never see what transpired-we only see the aftermath. We are not given a timeline, though you can judge for yourself how long man and son have been attempting to 'live'. Mortensen carries the entire film on his weathered and weary shoulders. I cannot gush enough about his performance-in any film really. But here, you only have to look into his eyes-so full of soul and despair to realise that not only is this man acting, he is really and truly transformed. Just incredible really.     The atmosphere is grainy and desolate, without color of any kind and as you watch, you slowly go mad envisioning what you would do in such a situation. The film features horrors that include cannibalism and at one point, you see the father teach his son how to properly kill himself if anything should ever happen to him. Very disturbing.     By film's end, you are mentally exhausted. This is not a fast-paced film at all. It is purposefully slow-going and I believe that was done with the intent to transport you inside the film itself, and in my mind, it succeeds. After the credits started to roll, I found myself depressed for the rest of the day. This is probably one of the most desolate films I've ever seen, so I would avoid it if you like your films with satisfying ending-because this isn't it.

B002VECM6S|4.0|First things first. I like Sandra Bullock enormously, but this was NOT an Oscar-winning performance. Not up against Helen Mirren or Meryl Streep. She did a great job -- it's a warm, very positive story and I'm glad she fought to produce it. The rest of the cast is just as good, including the young man who plays Michael. Let's hope we see more of him, too. It's definitely a feel-good and yes, family, movie and there's nothing wrong with that. Could we all be as open-hearted and accepting as the Touhy family -- tho' it didn't hurt to have money! Not the point -- all around a fine film. Don't miss it.

B0033AX26I|5.0|The saga of the San Patricios - an Irish/Catholic/German volunteer unit that crossed the line to bravely fight for Mexico during the 1846-1848 \\"Mexican War\\" is one of many fascinating little-known stories of gallantry and desperation in history, but Ry Cooder, a splendid musician and story teller, went a wee bit over the top in his song \\"Sailing to Mexico.\\" He portrays the Irish immigrants who crossed the river as conscripts when, in fact, the United states relied on Regular Army soldiers (who volunteered to serve for a specified term of enlistment) and volunteer regiments raised by specific states. The real story does not need to be embellished - the Irishmen who deserted and joined the Mexican army were mistreated by their American officers, NCOs and fellow soldiers -  there is plenty of evidence of nativism in the U.S. at this time (history repeats itself, does it not?) but those brave boys of Erin, just like like the Irish immigrants who made up much of the U.S. Army during and after the Civil War, were volunteer enlistees, who made the best of a bad lot. Remember, Garryowen was and is the song of the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment.    Still, I applaud Ry Cooder for his latest opus. This is very good work - beautiful music by many first-rate musicians, a delighttful synthesis and a little-known story that begged to be told.
