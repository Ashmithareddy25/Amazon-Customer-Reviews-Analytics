1401232590|5.0|At first i was a little skeptical about reading this one but when i finished it i was thrilled. This book is so adictive that now i need to find more books made by Loeb. I still can't forgive him for Marvel's Ultimatum but i'm really pumped up for reading things like spiderman blue. Great work by Loeb and excelent art by Tim Gale.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is great for people that LOVE horses like me my horses name is sady. you should get this app and its free!
1401216676|4.0|Great art by Bolland. I really digged the art on this one. The story was good but not great as many people points out IMO. The backstory to the joker was the part i enjoyed the most. I would recomend it!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The show was recommended to me by a family member so I thought I would give it a try and now I am hooked. I am watching every episode starting with the first one and I am sure that I will go on to the subsequent seasons. I may be late to the party but I am having as much fun as I would have if I arrived on time.<br /><br />Great show, great characters and each episode has a very interesting and addictive plot.
B009NY43NY|5.0|What a great resolution to so many story lines and characters. I was sad to see Eric go away, but Pam has always been a favorite  - so &#34;Go Pam&#34;!! Some of us always thought that the guy in this story was always the right guy for Sookie.. Charlaine - THANK YOU for all the hours of enjoyment  watching these wonderful characters sort out their very complicated lives!! They make our worlde seem so much easier t manage.. Can't wait to see what you have for us next!
B00AR83PN4|5.0|Although it is difficult, it is awesome! I used to play a simple one and loved it, but that is easier. This is not that simple and easy, but interesting. Move on!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and fun. Really got the brain juices flowing.  I look forward to more levels. Entertaining for the whole Family.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I believe this book is free from Amazon Publishing, It is an excellent book that I will be referring to in the next few days. I will begin to publish my books. There are gobs of step by step tips and gobs of sites for more help. I ofter refer to the book for different reasons. A good book to have in your Kindle.I found it to be very helpful. I have published 6 Ebook and it was so easy.DELLAROSE
B005544V6A|5.0|Awesome show, i'm absolutely hooked! I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who likes smart story lines and well written dialogue.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I attached this to my motorcycle side-view mirror arms and it hasn't moved since.  It comes with two U-shaped bars of different shapes so it should work on a variety of objects.
B005R32L66|1.0|was of no use on my Kindle Fire, can download it but not use it. Deleted it the same time.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Fun game with different challenges on the levels. Very well put together. Would definitely recommend for anyone! Big fan of the different characters.
0345803485|1.0|I didnt even want to give 1 star....got bored & amazed the author kept using key phrases over & over! I was not impressed......
B003GK22PW|4.0|An author with a nice and interesting style of writing keeping the interest from start to finish with lots of suspens
B004M5HUXE|5.0|This book is classic erotic from a time when erotica wasn't so mainstream. I haven't finished it yet but look forward to the completion of a great novel.
B009KCUX3S|1.0|I suppose some people like  this style, i prefer old fashioned text book. A summary of main features of Java would really help
B004VD3YIM|1.0|this and the free version reset every minute or so, and cause zoomed in local network webcam to unzoom and stop playing audio. This happens on both Sony Xperia t and first gen kindle fire. Kindle fire also frequently completely locks up when running this program. Also, Amazon AppStore has old version of program.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|After finishing the first series, I'm ready to know more. I have a feeling this series will just keep getting better! Though I put the series down for brief interruption by another author (a very poor decision on my part as my time was better spent here) I came back and am glad I did.
1430308001|5.0|I'm involved in local board and card gaming groups, but recently got interested in getting into chess beyond the basics.  I had always been overwhelmed by chess books and software, like 550 page books on chess openings for black.<br /><br />I discovered Ward Farnsworth's web page and was blown away by his statement that most of chess play is tactics.  He maps out a learning plan to start with tactics and then later work on chess openings and the end game.  Although his website is free, I went ahead and purchased this book.<br /><br />I really like his teaching style.  It's just great.  He gives tons of examples from real play that become progressively more difficult.  So, the book is just fun as a chess puzzle book.  But, he also explains what you need to be looking for and what though process you need to be using.  The book is also structured so that you can choose any chapter and start working on it - so it's flexible to individual needs.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book had all the sex in it like the other two but there wasn't much of a story line. Plus I didn't like the way it just ended and not knowing when another book is coming out but when it does, I will be buying it. Curious as to what happens next
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great novel about teens and cancer. I loved the insight of the characters and the wording.  The main characters were wonderful to know.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|best game ever played son likes it for on the bus. it the best for long car rides or when waiting for the bus to come and every thing
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was beautifully written and a surprise with the twist and turns of the characters.  The harshness of life was raw and the kindness was real. I enjoyed all the connections and missed connections.
0061122416|4.0|Great things really do come in small packages. This small novel was captivating and addictive from start to finish! A life-changing masterpiece that I will treasure.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|It was well told through the eyes of the servant with many surprises in the plot, but the main mystery was rather obvious.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get the game. My brother and I love it. We play Minecraft. My brother called it minercraft. SO GET THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Le Carre's best book in a long time. The novel is very current -- he sensed the whole movements in security and intelligence that is taking place right now.
030758836X|2.0|I found this book very intriguing in the beginning and it did hold my interest but that was mainly because I wanted to see the bad guy get what he deserved. Yet, the ending was so unsatisfying... it felt like such an injustice. I don't want to reveal any spoilers but if you attempt to read this book, expect to be biting your nails in irritation and have a good book ready to erase any lingering annoyance.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|My target audience, a 7 year old girl and 9 year old boy were waiting for this movie. They really enjoyed it, but they felt the first was better. I loved Lucy! :-)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Thought provoking and challenging but not impossible!<br />Much better than I expected.  I hope they continue to more and more floors.  And somewhat quickly because I am already on the 4th floor!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I SO FAR Like twitters app through amazon sense i cant get google play store through my tablet yet cause it's not one of there listed devises.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|That says it all, for someone wanting to take charge of their lives once and for all this is the book for you
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Highly recommend for folks who are WW III buffs and who know airplanes!  It was a slow read for me because I only ride in air planes.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|I didn't really watch The Avengers because I expected a great movie, I mostly wanted to test Amazon Prime streaming to compare it with Netflix. So the movie was just OK for me (I'm pretty much tired of and too old to enjoy the plethora of movies built around blowing things up). Anyway, Amazon streaming is more than acceptable; I give it a solid B grade. Takes longer to load up and doesn't have all the features of Netflix, but the picture is very good. I ended up buying Prime. I assume Amazon will continue to build its streaming library and improve its features. Besides, I buy quite a few things on Amazon and I think that in June I save almost enough in shipping costs to pay for Prime. Love Amazon.
B003B02O3C|5.0|I enjoy all of his well written books.  This was riveting from start to finish.  I had a difficult time putting it down.
0307730700|4.0|Very well done biography that was a fast and exciting read. Overcoming adversity in unimaginable situations time and time again is the theme of this book.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|This was the first season of True Blood.  I really became addicted after just a few episodes.  Be sure to buy the entire season at one time.. it's much less expensive.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What a season...oh my! Love this show & being able to watch it nonstop is quite enjoyable. I'd recommend this show to anyone!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is so much better than the TV shows.  I'd rather read about the action and create my own pictures instead of watching someone's else's interpretation of the book.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Sitting down for a Game of Thrones marathon...can watch all the episodes without interruption...this set was a birthday gift and has been enjoyed completely!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really worth 7$ but it could use some enderman and the end in pocket edition and make dimonds A LOT EASIER TO FIND other than that i luv it
0062238868|5.0|This is a wonderful book written by a wonderful Texas man.  I read it in one day.  Thank you doesn't even began to cover it!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|A  good lawyer show set in Chicago where political corruption abounds. It helps you understand why Obama is such aliar.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just when you think it can't get any better alas, it does! A surprise, a new intrigue, whatever you didn't expect happens.
B008XFJEE2|2.0|No story line that makes sense, bad acting and poor writing.  Would never suggest this to a friend...an enemy maybe.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It was a great movie. I love dramatic comedies, and this delivered everything! I will watch this again and again!!
B009CF3MEK|4.0|Would have been better if someone else has played the Mia Farrow role, but still a good adaptation of the book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent characterization<br />Couldn't put the book down.  It provides poignant insight into Afghani culture.  Marvelous read from start to finish.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Pretty good movie. Interesting story line. Good characters. Some parts were intense and hard to watch. I would recommend it.
B008Y73940|4.0|The Lincoln Lawyer is a very nice and class movie. I shall recommend this movie to other friends as well.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|If you expect non-stop action, you'll get that.  You won't get a lot of twists or turns.  I like that John is showing his age and accepting it.  It is different that he is a side-kick to his son's mission, utilizing his experience and earning the respect his character deserves.  The story takes place in Russia, and that was different but it was a little annoying reading the subtitles from the Russian characters who clearing spoke English.  There isn't a big villain as in the previous Die Hard movies.  The interaction between John and his son worked better than I expected.  Overall, you will get what you expect from a Die Hard movie.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The voice of death tells the story of life. Living on the page is surrounded by so much dying in the margins. The prose is story sprinkled with so much poetry. We all survive so much in all different ways but we each go by way of the same exit sign...death. a truly remarkable story of life, loss, love and war that can be told today, nothing ever changes but the names, places and dates.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is always classy with marvelous costumes and settings.  The actors are superb and well casted.  I could watch this program repeatedly to appreciate the depth of the characters and their relationships with each other.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|ENJOYED THIS GAME SO MUCH!  But you need to add more floors though. Once I got started I didn't want to quit playing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was hard to get into but worth reading. The ending was not what I expected. Now it has been made into a movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very easy to use, and fun also. I like that it doesn't require WiFi to play, and it also uses realistic scenarios. This is an app worth downloading!!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This is a great read for almost any age. An interesting yet scary concept is portrayed that could very easily be the worlds future. A must read.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Iam using it to help me do a mini workout every day. aA mini work out is better than none. And I can do it at work.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Definitely worth a read. Great third book. But just a bit of a bridging book. couldn't put it down. Highly recommend.
1400052181|5.0|The book is really about three intersecting women -- Henrietta Lacks, her daughter Deborah, and the author.  Though a journalist, Skloot has been willing to include her excitement, reactions, exasperation, sorrow, and affection as she recreates a long research project and her sudden understanding of the effect of her work on those she was researching.  The book club includes many who grew up in the south during the time period described and others who have moved here, and it led to a long and revealing discussion about our past, present, and future race relations.  There is only one hero in the book, and I will leave it to the reader to discover him/her.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|An  excellent series.  Well written and well acted.  The costumes and backgrounds are authentic and beautiful.  The plot is well thought out.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Anyone who likes dogs ( at all ) will love this book. Easy read, very heart warming story. Makes you want to read more.
B009H5IS1W|4.0|I like how they left the episode open ended for the series! At the time they thought this was the last season to be produced! Can't wait for the 9th!
B003YL4L0W|5.0|This is a very real, and down to earth story. Very easy to read,and keeps you involved. Love her books.
0761169253|5.0|This book vary good , you can read many things about creative, it have somrthin new, fuuny, and you will love it
B001EBWISG|5.0|Don't know how much is fact and how much is fiction, but this movie tells the story of a group of 1960's New York mobsters in fine fashion. A great, lighthearted retelling with an excellent flair for humor of a lifestyle that was anything but a joke to these men and their significant others. DeNiro and Pesci are at their best. If you haven't seen it, see it now. It's an offer you can't refuse !
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Feel good and clever program and its a nice trip back into time when TV was a more uplifting experience
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Sixto Rodriguez is a legendary musician and singer in the genre of Dylan. The only problem is... he was not aware he was a legend for 20 years until a documentary being produced on his life discovered he was not dead, as was commonly believed, but very much alive and well in the USA.<br />This  is a true story of a construction worker who became famous in another country while remaining unknown in his own.
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|Great classic to share with the younger generations.  Watching my children's faces as they watched E.T. for the first time was priceless.  Another great memory to go along with the memory of being 11 and watching it at the theater with my family.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was very good it surprised me a lot and was very good<br /> It is to bad there are only three
015206396X|5.0|This book has more to it than words can describe. Katsa is a spunky and hilarious heroine who despite her Grace, keeps an innocent heart and tries her best to right her wrongs. She not only finds her freedom, the truth of her Grace, love, and adventure, she also finds herself and more friends than she could ever hope for. I recommend this to anyone who wants a book that not only holds all the things mentioned above, but also one that keeps your mind active. The book arrived in wonderful condition, and I was more than pleased when, after reading it, realized the pages were well kept and stain free. I definitely recommend this book for a read and this provider for other people to consider purchasing from.
B00000064E|5.0|Beautiful music by an artist that I am enjoying getting to know.  Just lovely stuff!  I'll probably be getting more of his music.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just love Downtown Abbey.Once you start watching you are not going to be able to stop.Cant wait until next season come out.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I will be waiting for the TV release of this movie. The profanity that goes on through the whole movie takes away from the plot. It could have been an interesting story with a semi believable plot but it becomes harder to concentrate the longer it goes on.
0684824906|5.0|I love the background on the other central characters this books provides to show how much Lincoln's presidency changed the world.  Doris provides a great deal of personal information and historical reflectiveness in the central figures and does a great job of contrasting the differently personalities and how they might have acquired the traits that helped them lead during trying items.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Having memories of the event still fresh made the movie ARGO interesting to watch. My only negative is there is a lot of use of the F word through the whole film. The movie is fun to watch, very edge of your seat and interesting to say the least. I would recommend it but not for the whole family.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|This movie does not follow the book at all and I'm big about holding true to the original work. If I hadn't read the book first, it would have been ok. Overall, it was a waste of $5.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Amazing movie great when I was a kid still awesome now. Jim Henson and his studio very amazing job. Not to mention animation and animatronics well beyond the times this movie was made.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I've tried a lot of different sudoku apps, but this one is by far my favorite. It has all the features I want, many of which were lacking in other apps I've tried. I just play Classic mode, but there are many other for folk who like something a little different.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love puzzle games like this. It was challenging but not to the point of getting frustrated.  Interface felt a little clunky on the fire but wasn't horrible.  Ran out of levels too quick can't wait for more.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Could not download properly at first, I had to restart my kindle. I started three puzzles and each time an error note came up and the game crashed. The puzzles I started were completely gone. I had to start over again. I just removed it and am downloading one more time to see if it happens again.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I forgot how much fun it is to do the auction portion of buying things. This app is great. It does the count down when your in the minutes of your biding!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am in love with Pinterest. I get in trouble with my husband because I spend hours and hours looking at projects and then I do them and he gets sick if it! LOL!
B001CTGQBK|5.0|VERY interesting to watch this movie years later... The actors are decades older than your average high school students... Why the hell didn't everyone notice that when it first came out? But the songs are still classic. Certainly captures a moment in time and makes it exciting.
1619692368|1.0|Was not funny, I expected to laugh out loud and I did not, thought the book was lame and I really am a fan of Ellen.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Not much to say about this one... A good cast wasted on a lackluster film that is not memorable but suffices for an hour or so of average entertainment.
0525478817|2.0|I think when you read a book that everyone LOVES, sometimes expectations are not met.  Maybe its better not to read too many glowing reports?  If you don't love the book as much as the others, you begin to wonder what you have missed!!!<br /><br />That's the case here.  I liked the book.  It was a different story of 2 teenagers who have cancer and their relationship with each other and those around them over a period of time.  Hazel was a deep thinking teenager with some fight about her.  Augustus was a bit too pompous for me to really enjoy the character....but there seemed to be lots of forced witty dialogue that I couldn't imagine teenagers speaking like that?  In that sense, it all felt a bit contrived.<br /><br />As for recommending it?  I can't.  It just didn't hold my attention or make me want to turn every page to see what would happen.  I don't regret the time reading it but I forgot a lot of it, the minute the story was ended.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Missed Seasons 1 and 2 when they were on tv.  I am loving all of the DA programs!  Nice to see the beginning!  Some shockers!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As someone with a sister i couldn't bare to lose, this story resonates in me. The whole time i read, i felt like a puppet moving with the feelings from Katniss. Who wouldn't try to start a revolution, to save innocent people, to speak for those who couldn't? It was not a choice for Katniss, but i doubt anyone could have<br />taken the role so well. I ate this book and the first two like someone ravenous, and now that i've finished, i feel like crying, and i'm not sure why. Either way, i'm left with a good feeling, if not a little bittersweet.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I found this to be an engrossing read. (Not a pun) to me it makes the whole thing more probable, read less like a work of fiction, even as you realized the utter lack of probability. I also enjoyed the movie which I saw first. Entertaining in its own way, and of course completely different. Brooks is very clever, gee where did he get that from?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enjoyed a family show with great stories, complete period details ans wonderful actors! Can't wait to see what's in the future.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Terrific product.  Great balance and very comfortable.  Highly recommended by my businessman husband who has large hands.  Looking to purchase another.
B003M2DWE4|5.0|Very nice alarm clock! Super cute and affordable. Amazon always has the best prices. Highly recommend it. Variety of colors.
0345803485|1.0|I don't type a lot of reviews, but I read a lot.  A lot.  I am not using hyperbole when I say that this is the worst book I've ever read, and think that the author should be ashamed for having written it.<br /><br />There are some wonderful 1-star reviews on this site so I won't go into detail.  I'll just say that  1.) I don't even practice BDSM but was totally offended at the way she portrayed the lifestyle.  2.)  The writing is so terrible.  It's a fanfic and reads like one.  I always explain that I'm NOT a book snob - I love romance novels and read them all the time - but this was just unreadable.  In fact, I stopped reading it 2/3 of the way through and instead read hilarious, snarky recaps on a blog.  3.)  The inner goddess.  I just...I just can't with this.  4.)  I don't understand people that say that this is nothing like Twilight.  When I was reading this all that I could think of was how similar it was to Twilight!  I'm sorry - if you read Twilight and read FSoG and don't see the blatant similarities, something is terribly wrong with your reading comprehension.  5.)  Straight. Up. Abusive. Relationship.  6.)  BDSM is practiced by lost souls, but it's okay because you can heal your man with love.<br /><br />In conclusion - I hated this book with a fiery passion, but am so glad for all the glorious snark that it's inspired on the internet.  The mockery by bloggers - who unfortunately have far, far greater writing skill than EL James - has been a comfort to me that not everyone is totally insane in this world.  Also, it has opened up discussion about erotica, BDSM, and abusive relationships.  So while I don't think it's a TOTALLY horrible thing that it's happened, it IS a horrible book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive and very fun. With many different characters and themes, this game rates five stars in my mind.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I love the author's writing style but I kept hoping for a main character to emerge.  The were a lot of good characters but none seemed to have their complete story told.  I was left wanting to know more about them.  I definitely enjoyed the book but not as much as his first two books.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|this has re-kindled my enthusiasm to be a better entrepreneur! As an insurance agent, I need to keep myself focused, but also need to self-motivate to keep making progress and always drive “new” sales!
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Will be happy to see other episodes when available on Prime.  I know A wants me to rent or buy more episodes but for $79 annual fee, I think they should be included.  Have noticed that the &#34;free&#34; shipping offers are only available for approx. same final price as those on which shipping is charged.
B000002H48|5.0|The Boss, Jackson Browne, Carly Simon, James Taylor, and so many more. Singing solo and togerther, great concert. I really enjoyed this. The Times they are a changin, great rendition,
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is a very good read. The story's characters believable. The scenes masterfully described. I try to think if I was a resident of one of the Silo's,what would I do.  Kudos to Mister Howey. Will be reading the whole series now.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Probably the most under rated band and progressive rockers of their time. This album was their master piece. Though critics panned it but if you are a fan you must have it in your collection.
B008220BLG|5.0|Isaac Marion was extremely genius to come up with this concept.  The book was great and they did an equally great job with the movie!  Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer make a cute couple!  I can't wait for the book's sequel!  Hopefully they will continue with the films.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I's my first Harry Bosch story and I guess I could read more, but not my favorite book of the month.<br />the premise and time span were interesting.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|Great way to introduce a series.  Maggie Q is spot on as Nikita!  My favorite version of Nikita by far!
B006N0YWGY|1.0|Made my kindle unstable so I deleted it. Kindle still unstable. The graphics were great and looked like a fun game. No speed control. Only one speed,very fast. Unable to control it so it wasn't fun for me.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I never read the books by L.J. Smith and I don't think I ever want to.... because this show is amazing!  THe cast are a perfect fit and really portray the characters well.  Can't wait to see more!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|More of the same awsome story, with even more complicated characters and incomplete cliff hangers and head scratching moments. But after all that....is it worth reading if its going to take 4 years from the time this book was written to the time book 6 comes out? AND another 4 to 5 years before book 7. Me personally will have to re-read before getting the next one as these stories are so complicated i will have forgotten most of the &#34;details&#34;. If you havent started the series i would say wait,if you have well then get your fix and wait like the rest of us hungry suffering dogs.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|This is an awesome TV Show!  The best version of Nikita I think!  The CW was genius to pick this up.  Season 2 ended well but Season 3 was pretty crazy and ended so sad!  So I cannot wait for Season 4.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|To start I'm a big John Torturro fan from his work with Spike Lee, but these three actors have a great on screen rapport.  I'm always a little wary of period pieces set in the 20th century south but I think the Coen brothers brought the right mix of comedy and larger than life characters to re-tell the Odyssey.  This is a must watch strictly based on the amazing soundtrack!
B003L77GH4|5.0|This season did NOT disappoint!  It was great!  Cool storylines and twists for sure!  MORE MORE MORE!  Team Damon baby!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|It is a show that always keeps me entertained, love all of the characters and story lines.  Wonderful cast and Special guest appearances.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I totally fell in love with this series.  It is so amazing to see new takes on classic fairytales.... and having them live in the real world, genius!  I am so excited to see more of this!
B0036S4C6G|5.0|I really like the way Jennifer Egan plays with time in this collection of linked short stories, moving the reader seamlessly from past to present to a future that uses social networking in unusual and interesting ways.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I've read other books by Dan Brown and have to say all of them are very similar. This book wasn't bad but to long. After half becoming kind of boring because to many unreal situation going on and they are reapiting constantly.<br />The end is positive but after all the action I expected something more.
1449437524|5.0|I love The Oatmeal and his comics. When I heard one of my most favorite comics \\"My Dog the Paradox\\" was going to be made into a book I knew I had to have it. Yes I had read it several times before on The Oatmeal website, but having it in book form was just too fun to pass up. I have since passed this around to several people and told them to take ten minutes and read it. Everyone has loved it! Great conversation starter about our loveable pets and their quirks.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Good TV Program I wish I could find more seasons word word word word word word word word  these are words cuz this is a pain in the butt
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is an excellent read. Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful author. He has a way of making the characters come alive. You feel the emotions with the characters. You get excited, angry, laugh ,and cry with them. I could hardly put the book down. I'd read late into the night fighting to keep my eyes open because I just wanted to finish this page and that would turn into wanting to finish this chapter. Until I realized I was reading the same sentence over and over. It's hard to find a book like that.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Was very impressed with the overall simplicity yet available advanced functions.  Was not bothered by the &#34;nag ware&#34;  Overall, an excellent utility for the &#34;price&#34;.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My son and I, both like to play this game. Surprisingly it is helping to make my son to be more detailed oriented,  he now spots subtle differences and insignificant decoration hoping they would clues to help him escape in his real world environment.  This game is highly addictive so be careful.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|The book is a good read but not the best. My experience is that most characters seems to exhibit similar behavior to some extent like the choice of words used in dialogues.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great show that is well written with great acting. I would watch more prime time TV if the shows on the networks were even close to the quality this show is. I can't wait for the next season.
B003719GGS|3.0|Its not a very exciting book to read but the points mentioned are worth the time spend. Mostly its basic common sense but its nice to have it in a book.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Would have liked a little more info on exactly how things ended up for everyone, but all in all a good finish to the series.
B00D2ZF24O|5.0|In an age of broken relationships between father's and their children, it is always nice to see a movie about the healing between a father and his son. This was undoubtedly a  good movie, despite what critics say. Albeit it did not have the usual Hollywood checklist; explosions, sexy girl, betrayal, soap-opera drama, glitter... But perhaps the reason for the animosity toward the movie is not so much its style, as its uncomfortably familiar insight (early on anyway) into the father-son relationship of many of us today.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone.  It is well done and the acting is very good.  Loved the story line.  It's a feel good kind of movie with a little bit of mystery and intrigue thrown in the mix.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season leaves you wanting more! I am so glad I started watching this series. The last episode is a cliff hanger! Wow, can't wait for the next season.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I love the show. It was funny and cute. All the characters seem real and I could relate to all of them in some way.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game.  you can spend hours playing it.  It is fun to play when you have idle time to pass the time away.  I love the graphics and easy on the eyes.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|This CD is fantastic.  Each song is unique but they all blend together so the album has a great flow.
B005EHILV4|1.0|When reading most reviews for this product, people indicated that this pre gave you \\"bang for your buck.\\" I have found that to be untrue. I was severely disappointed when this junk preamp, even when attached to the cloudlifter, still gave off a VERY noticeable analog white noise hiss on my Shure SM7B. So all in all, my Blue Yeti USB condenser was FAR more reasonably priced then what you will end up having to pay for the Shure SM7B to be noise-free, and deliver on all of it's upside. For that, step number one is a quiet preamp with tons of CLEAN gain to activate the naturally quiet dynamic mic... This preamp/mixer was DEFINITELY not that! Severely disappointed- packaged and returned today. Not worth the $500 fee you will need to pay for a good pre, so picking this up on discount for about $50 was reasonable, and in my price range. But, you get what you pay for. Bye bye garbage mixer.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|I did not encounter any of the problems others mentioned so perhaps they were fixed....the only problem I had was at first I didn't notice there were two different yellows one that lookers kind of glowy and one that didn't....it takes a little bit to figure the controls out but all in all if you like this type of game it will entertain you for hours I am sure....only giving four stars because I can't honestly say I love it
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I needed a platform to write my thoughts and ideas as they come to Me and this was perfect, the ease of use and navigation components made this my favourite tool on my device. It inspires me to put my thoughts down. It also has an amazing data back up system.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I'm dissappointed in this game. There aren't enough directions in the beginning of the game. I'm not able to unlock the combination to the safe and everytime I go out of the game and come back it doesn't save what I've done. I have to start all over again. I haven't totally given up on the game yet, but I don't think I'm too far from it.
B007IK44CK|1.0|Every sequel movie that uses the same concept as the original movie is worse than he original movie. This movie is no exception. And I did like the original movie and even the TV series.
B005ZKYXZI|1.0|I sent the movie back because it was suppose to be a two disc set. Blue Ray & DVD but the DVD disc was missing.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Not a fan of all comic book movies, but this one was VERY well done. Great story, good flow, no lagging parts, perfect amount of comedy relief. Loved it. Dare I say I would watch a part 2.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|You start off with a Fantastic set of music and then you set it all in a Wonderfully Historic place and bring all together with Musicians who are at the Top of their game and you have &#34;Live in Gdansk&#34;. Great Music, Great behind the scenes--FABULOUS!!!  I would have liked a bit more Behind the Scenes stuff, but since I also have remember That Night, it is Okay.<br /> Really Enjoyed this DVD!!!
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|If only this thing could remind me to use it<br />I know it would be great since it works on my macbook and my iphone<br />But alas...
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This is a Wonderful DVD and I have watched it many times over!! I will watch it many more--Great Concert--Gilmour is the BEST! The Special Features are Such a Bonus--I Laughed SO Hard and shed some tears as well. The album &#34;On An Island&#34; is his Best Work as a solo artist and the Concert is just Spectacular.<br />I Highly Recommend this DVD for ALL Pink Floyd/David Gilmour/Music Fans. I Wish I had known about this album/DVD 3 years ago before my Mom died--she would have Loved Music!!!
193700788X|1.0|Unsatisfying mess. Glad HBO is veering away from original plot. My love for the author has vanished. If you like this book, then you weren't in love with feisty Sookie or any of the other Southern Vampires. You just liked reading about a woman who complained and settled for boring.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great Show!  I'm glad I'm streaming the episodes so I don't have to wait so long to see what happens next!
B008Q0AZVK|2.0|I thought this movie had potential, but was strongly disappointed...  The acting was so, so...  The story, ehhh...  Yeah, was a big waste of my time.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is my second time through this series and I like it even better than the first time. We ought to have more quality shows like this one that features 3-dimensional characters and challenging story lines. Three cheers for this series and I hope it continues for a good long time
B005U9RE1Y|5.0|I love this movie.  I, also, love that I can get movies on my kindle fire and not take up a lot of room in my house.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a subject that interests me.  I found it to be very enlightening.  I would recomend this book to people of &#34;like&#34; interests.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I really like this game.  I like games where you can grow things virtually and perform tasks.  This is a fun game.
B00BXHE0CI|1.0|It sucks. If I wanted pointless white noise I could go make it on my computer for a lot less than what this album costs. Their guitars sound like they aren't even tuned correctly which they most likely aren't. These guys are probably more of those losers who think it makes them so br00t4l if they tune them wrong. The vocalist is straight up terrible and the drummer is par at best. You can't even really tell there's bass because the monotonous detuned guitars drown it all out. If you want good metal, go listen to The Black Dahlia Murder or even Toxic Holocaust. The latter might take a little getting used to, but in the end it is 100 times better than this poor excuse for a metal band.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|The emotional layers in this novel reduced me to tears and also filled me with such a sense of joy.I could not put it down.
030789701X|5.0|I played Skyrim when it was first published, but left it some time after due to lack of time to playing it. And so I never had the time to playing it again. That is where I missed and wasn't aware of the 3 expansion packs, until quite recently when I found that there is the Legendary Edition of the game that includes the main game + all the 3 expansions in one box! So I placed an order for it and after that found that there's even an official game guide for that very Legendary Edition that covers-- Well...EVERYTHING! :)<br /><br />This game guide covers everything you need and don't need to know about this game! Including details about creatures, places, maps, secrets and much more! And that is why it's quite heavy!! If you like to learn more about its size and weight, then I suggest you to go and check YouTube for unpacking videos. In addition, you get an unlock code for an interactive e.guide that now includes Solstheim and additional Dragonborn content.<br /><br />I choose the Collector's Edition of this guide because I prefer the Hardcover over a regular Paperback. Besides it looks and feels awesome when you hold it in your hands. Like an old and powerful magic book. ;) And besides it's only $8 difference. It also includes 2 ribbon bookmarks (only in the collector's edition as long as I know). I think that the Paperback edition has only 1 ribbon bookmark.<br /><br />There's much more to tell about this fantastic guide but I can't cover everything here. The book is over 1,100 pages!<br /><br />I recommend this product for everyone who wants to learn everything that the world of Skyrim has to offer.
B00B769XB8|5.0|awesome 3d, awesome movie and spectacular all the way trough. I highly recommend this movie. especially in 3d. thank you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Wonderful ideas and inspirations!  It's my new hobby.  I need to work much less in order to Pinterest every day!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The author did a good job of building the characters, some better than others, and then taking the story to a crescendo near the end, only to let it all unravel at the end. I don't know if I'm picking the wrong books to read, but it seems so many of them have the same trait.
B002KLOPF8|4.0|I have seen this movie at least 4 times since it came out. The language is pretty rough but true to life I suspect.
0446547638|3.0|Generally enjoy Nicholas Sparks and check out his books when looking for something engrossing to read.  This one was too much.  One tragedy or impending tragedy after another.  Could only read a few pages at a time as one sad event piled on another.  The entwining of the lives of all the characters was not believable.  One gets used to suspending disbelief when reading Sparks' books but usually not to this extent.  Dawson deserved better.
B007ZYJMU8|4.0|I'm having a hard time wrapping myself around this film. It's exqusitely filmed, scripted, and acted, and the director does a marvelous job of painting unsympathetic people sympathetically. That in itself is a kind of artistic marvel.... But I was profoundly troubled by a few scenes in the movie, which were far more intense given the nature of the characters involved. I would have given this film 5 stars were it not for those scenes; they left me a bit scorched, I would say.  That being said, however, I do not think anything in this movie was extraneous; i.e. the director and scriptwriter have made use of each scene and each event in the lives of these characters in a masterful way to draw the viewer further into this dark world and make it partake of what one author once referred to as possessing the inner consistency of reality. That they make bad choices and live to suffer the consequences of those choices only reflects the truth about a broken humanity that is powerless to save itself: the human person must look to another for the way forward into integrity and the fulness of life.<br /><br />I am particularly fascinated by the way prayer was handled in the movie--a typically improvised prayer (offered in somewhat rote fashion, as such prayers often are) spoken over a man in flight from his own broken self is received as a pronouncement of ultimate hope and light that reveals to him in stark terms just how far away from all that he truly is. That such a religious moment is not resolved in a superficial conversion that makes Life All Better speaks volumes about the depth and insight that is offered here.<br /><br />All the same, I could've done without the truly ugly parts that hang about me like a cloud, weeks after viewing it.
B0012HQKZE|4.0|The bluray is good, a noticeable uptick in audio and video rez from the now ancient DVD, but there are still no extras and this film has an epic production story. Just read Art Linson's book and later film &#34;What Just Happened,&#34; to find out the ridiculousness that went on behind the scenes, mostly concerning Baldwin's beard. Apparently from this and his current Viking Capital One ads Baldwin likes beards.<br /><br />Isn't this film old enough that we can finally get the story without hurt feelings or impacting Baldwin's current gig as corporate whore.<br /><br />Anyways, I consider The Edge to have temporarily closed the book on wilderness adventure movies. Not a frequently visited genre anymore, and strangely after this movie (it wasnt a hit) because this pretty much covers the philosophical, primal struggle of man in the wilderness. Not much left to cover on the subject. Top notch writing from Mamet with near every other line quotable, career peak acting from Hopkins and Baldwin (before he switched into permanent Jack Donaghey mode), Jerry Goldsmith's chilling response to John Williams' Jaws score and Tamahori's absolute best directing effort of his spotty career.<br /><br />If you haven't seen The Edge because it always looked like two dudes in a Hemmingway impression fight to the death, than you have been missing a great film. Instead of watching the latest slog of bloated budget awfulness, give this not too old survival flick a chance, they don't get much better.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book for book club and I am so glad I did.  It is a very wonderful book!
B00AATFJK2|4.0|Fully expecting to have to shut this off when the cheese got so sweet it would hurt my teeth, I was pleasantly surprised how sly Crichton was even back in the beginning.<br /><br />The first half-two thirds of the movie are cheese, but that is totally the point. Crichton was satirizing Disney and like the protagonists, lulling you into a consumer, theme park complacency, before he cinematically punches you in the face. The sets, the acting, the special effects, especially the music are all goofy to serve the story, it's not because they didn't have the budget, it's supposed to be like that. Think about Disney World and the early dark-rides with the cut-out Toads and plastic Peter Pans. Once things start going wrong at the park, things drastically change, as they should. The film coils up like a robot rattle-snake and when Yul Brenner calls out Brolin, Westworld strikes and the film kicks into overdrive. Well 1970's overdrive, not Michael Bay-blowup-the-world, nor even Jurassic Park overdrive, but Westworld, I think, is just as effective.<br />The camera work changes, the score changes, it's an awesome payoff, and shocked me how well it holds up.<br />It's like the precursor to the post-modernist Charlie Kaufman and clearly where Cameron got his vibe for Terminator. Listen to those spurs and tell me Cameron didn't rip that off.<br /><br />Disc has good pic quality and sound, definitely better than the early days DVD. Unfortunately there are limited but yet awesomely vintage extras.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was a great book.  Touches on so many emotions. It had me interested from the very beginning and kept it until the final page.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|viewing on Amazon Prime was a breeze - I love this show and it will be hard to wait until January for the next episodes - have caught up on all 3 current seasons in the last couple of months by watching on Amazon Prime.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know, but it has a lot of good information. Especially for those new to the topic.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My 6 year old offered to pay my 4 year old all the money he had in the car to play this game sooner.  Didn't want to wait for his turn.  My 5 year old said &quot;Thank you for getting this- it's sooo fun.&quot;  All for free.....enough said!!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Even if you didnt care for the plot itself, no one can deny how absolutely gorgeous the world Cameron created here is. The extra minutes dont take anything away from it.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Didn't see this series during it's original run.  Ordered all episodes and binged on them all weekend.  GREAT.  I found this series similiar to Dexter.  Highly recommend... even if you need to
B009K86D86|5.0|Great movie documents. It really makes me want to rethink my protein source. It's so disappointing to see how money drives morals. It's very sad.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Great music. Definately a different from some of his prior work but well worth purchasing.  I would highly recommend this one.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the various characters in this book,.and how they link together a story of the afghan people, past and present.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|This made me want to go back and watch the old Wizard of Oz to see the similarities and differences. Love the Black and White start to bring you right into an OZ movie.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Too short to give the subject  adequate coverage. I would recommend this book only to someone wanting a brief summary.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I've seen this a couple times and laugh alot.  John M is just great.  Can't wait to see Red 2
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This movie has got to be among the top 10 of amyone's list, seems to me. I actually enjoyed it better than the book. Acting, directing, writing, photography all par excellence! A \\"must see.\\"
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I am forced to write this review by seeing so much negative going on for this movie.<br />Come on guys, this movie is not that bad. I was not expecting it to be a path-breaker movie or something extraordinary.<br /><br />I found chase scene including some other high point of this movie.. In fact on bluray it was so good that I watched multiple times.<br /><br />now what I did not like,  Jai Courtney fails as a son of McClane. He does not look like McClane and there are so many other good actors who can do a better job then him. Now I am not saying he is a bad actor, but not in a single frame he looked like McClane's son. I loved McClane's daughther in Diehard 4, but I am sorry for his son. I think most of the bad reviews are for his son and not McClane himself.
078322740X|4.0|Goldie Hawn is enjoyable no matter whenther the movie is good or bad. Steve Martin is just another comic, actor or whatever IMO.  This movie started out really weird but it's worth staying with & turns out to be quite enjoyable, with a neat ending.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love the fact that this game makes you think and pay attention to every detail and the surroundings. Totally worth the $2 for a few hours of fun in solving the puzzles.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story and wonderful characters.  I can't wait for the next story line from one to the next to see what is going to happen.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Overall, I like the movie but it ran a little long.<br />I would definitely recommend the movie if you're a bond fan.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am enjoying season three.  I am not quite finished with it yet and will be sad for it to end.  Can't wait for season four to start.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|I usually love puzzle games but this one was too unresponsive to even play.  I was very disappointed in everything about this game.  The controls were difficult and really did not work.  Some of the colors are too close to each other in tone.  It is deleted already.  (I have a Kindle Fire.)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|By far my favorite show on t.v.  The only bad thing about it is that there aren't more Season 3 episodes!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I never had much of a desire to see this movie but did when I saw a preview for the sequel. It's a heartwarming story for the whole family with plenty of laughs for the grownups too. Definitely recommend it.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|This movie was entertaining and my wife would even consider watching it again, though possibly only if a friend wanted to watch it with her.
B00821OW8K|2.0|I watched 4 episodes and hoping it would get better but it's just boring over and over again.  It has very little actions but a lots of talking. It kept me wondering why the aliens didn't care killing those hundreds of people walking on foot in broad day light in the open????
B008HI7BMW|5.0|I listen to this album while I do computer programming. It is great for this purpose because the music smoothly transitions between tones and doesn't distract me.
B00AALX5SI|4.0|I nice mix of concert footage and behind the scene reality of what the artist had to deal with on a regular basis.
B000YHG72E|3.0|I appreciate this movie because it's pretty 'clean' (doesn't have much inappropriate content). The humor in it is a little on the stupid/goofy side, but it's still decently funny.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|This game is very epic .This game has very good graphics and has challenges that aren't just taking a couple of hits and punches it actually is very difficult. The controls are easy to use. My only complaint is that it is very,very,very difficult. I'm on a boss level and keeps on killing me . You should wait until the price is down to 99&cent; O.K
159463176X|4.0|My wife said that the book was entertaining but not as good the other two books that this author wrote. Most of the subplots and stories came together and were resolved in the end but some did not.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A real game that tests you power of observation and makes you think outside the box! I have never had to take notes to beat a game before! I loved this game!
B00004WIDQ|5.0|Classic movie whose computer graphics are surprisingly good, even though the movie was made years ago. The story is so engaging.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I love music.  the kind of music I like best is country music and classic music.  I also take piano lessons too.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This was an entertaining movie though some of it was rather predictable. The villain was decently disturbing (which is a good thing, as far as villains go). The story backdrop was pretty good and Daniel Craig did a decent job.
B003NS2T9G|4.0|Not as good as Dr. Who but I find find myself looking forward to the next episode. Captain Jack is a bit tough to figure out because he seems to be less of the happy go lucky adventurer than when we first saw him.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Be sure to play w/ wifi on to get the daily and weekly challenges.  Very fun to play, excellent time sink:-)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Each level was just the right amount of difficulty. Not to easy but not to long. Looking forward to new levels as soon as they are available.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|This movie has become a tradition with my daughter and me.  She wore out the VHS copy when she was four.  I even bought her an old key for our first birthday together, her fifth .  (I'm her adopted mom). Now at seventeen she still requests watching it together.  Watch it just before springtime. It's magic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although this book was about teenage cancer, it was a truly beautiful story about the courage and love that Hazel and Gus had for each other.  It was beautifully written. I would definitely recommend this book.
0823015017|5.0|Well explained, easy to understand, I do recommend this book for artists in general. Very good quality of the printing.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Although this story strays a little here and there from the facts, there is so much to like about it, that is just really doesn't matter.  For anyone who loves horses, enjoys thoroughbred horseracing, and watching a woman who has the fortitude to follow her dream, this is one that should be on your watch list.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|it passes the time, a lot of waiting but I will hang in there for a while tip I get bored. I like the builder games and this one isn't full of weird quests so I can deal with th waiting. its too had there isn't a consloe version of this, like it would be neat to make a monster rancher game with the jurassic creatures.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Bought this CD for my husband for his birthday along with tickets to see the Eagles on tour. The C D is great and I would strongly recommend it for any Eagles fan! We have watched multiple times in preparation for the concert. The music is fantastic and the history is very interesting!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|It seems Ms. Rowling is trying so hard to write an adult novel she forgot to write a story. I am not impressed, sadly. If I had not been reading this for a book club, I would have quit reading it.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This is exactly what a fantasy story should be - imaginative world with interesting and original rules, engrossing characters and story, good dialogue and character development... It's been a very long time that I have read its equal!  This will go down as one of the few books you'll remember fondly.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|My Grandson loved it. On rainy days I let my 2 grand children play games on my kindle, I,m so happy they have have quailty games for free.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Is relatively imaginative for a book in a series and keeps you on the edge.  On par with the original.
B0060D0OWA|5.0|what is not to love about jake gyllendaal?! the whole thing was really  great action and love hate  relationship with the stars. in my keeper bin!
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Please delete this review as i haven't read it yet (was for thr wrong book).  I will write a new one once i read this one.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I really like King and Maxwell.  This was a very good book. I didn't want to put it down.  I would highly recommend this book.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Couldn't stop watching, loved all the characters! Warning, when you start watching you won't want to stop! Thought Downton Abbey was good? Try this!
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Funny Baron movie. Less cringe worthy than Bruno but doesn't get the same laughs as Borat. A great movie to watch when there is nothing going on.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn is one of my most favorite writers.  I am going to miss him on the &#34;new book&#34; list.
B000FBFMZ2|3.0|Little slow at times but overall a good read.<br />Would recommend it for a good fun weekend or summer read.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I chose this book because I really enjoyed Gone Girl by the same author-Gillian Flynn. I liked it but it was not as good or as well written as Gone Girl. It is obvious that this is one of her earlier novels. I also read her book Dark Places which I thought was better than Sharp Objects but again, not as good as Gone Girl. Feel like I read them in the wrong order. Read this one first, then Dark Places, then Gone Girl.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|IT IS A VERY GOOD SHOW.  BUT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT HOW THEY ENDED IT. THE ENDING MADE ME VERY SAD
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Love this author but found this book jumped to too many stories.  Khalid didn't dig as deeply as he has in the past and the read wasn't as satisfying for me
B00459GJUM|5.0|I was watching this series on Netflix and with 4 episodes to go they DROPPED the Series!<br />NOT COOL!<br />Thankfully I was reminded of Amazon Prime and was able to finish the series. I will use my Amazon Prime even more now.<br />Thanks again!
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|Oz The Great and powerful was just OK. I wish it was a lot better. The wizard of Oz in 1939 was so great but this one was not good. James Franco could have been better.
B000PMG16U|5.0|It is nice to finally have all the movies on Blue Ray.  I don't know how many versions we have on VHS and DVD.  I know the movies are coming back to the big screen in 3D, looking very forward to taking my wife (the real Star Wars fan)to see them.
B008V41EIE|5.0|The Fog widescreen special Edition was very good. you also get some special extrs. The remake was very bad. Don't see the remake.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Descicable Me is a great movie to watch with the family. It is not complicated and is something that all ages can enjoy.
B0041P0MFI|5.0|Ghostbusters is a great movie plus Bill Murray is great in this movie. You have a all star cast. all good actors.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game! The levels are unique but not too challenging. I really hope they add more levels soon, ten is not enough!
B008BTC5E6|4.0|Throughout the book you will discover the life of a grate ultra marathoner with an inspiring story. Also you will get very good vegan recipes. Recommended to all runners.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|I don't know about you but I sure do miss old cartoon movies. With everything being computer animated/generated, either way, it's lost it's appeal for me.  I find myself putting on the &#34;old&#34; stuff for my kids who are loving them and are wanting to watch them again and again (yay cuz I love watching them too).  I love the making of their new family by adding onto their old family and ohana (sp?). I also wanted to be able to download it to my kindle for easier transport to boring appointments and waiting rooms.
B00B4ENTJK|5.0|A classic from my childhood love it. Audio and video looked great. HD remastered is a definite plus will certainly watch again.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Can be confusing glad it was unlimited hints didn't know what to do a lot of the game until you hit hint but at least it had a plot
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I'm really enjoying this game. It's a lot of fun. It gets you thinking. Each level gets more challenging. Fun. Fun. Fun.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|This is a good read, maybe not one of my favorites in the series but defenetly worth reading ! If you havent read the series -start with book 1 as this one containester spoilers
B00CL68NOG|5.0|There was something uplifting about this movie without being corny.  Comedy's no longer seem to be able to walk the line between sappy sweet, dark comedy or the vulgar. This one did. These two make a great movie pairing
B001XUPGLY|4.0|clearity is exelent and you can fast forward or rewind at any time so you dont miss anything .<br />so i think it should get a 4 star in classics.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's more addictive than popping bubble wrap. The first day, I lost 11 hours paying this game. 8 hours the second day. So this is a five star review and a warning lol.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Love her music and lyrics, again, what is there more to say except to recommend it to family, friends and co-worker.
B0006HC5HS|4.0|Marriage is a partnership.  Sometimes you have to compromise and do things that you're disinclined to for the one you love.  Me and my wife were at a used video store and she picked up \\"First Daughter\\".  My internal siren went off alarming me that this was a chick flick but I was doomed.  Not only did my wife purchase it but I had to watch it.  Having survived the film I'll say that for what it is it wasn't bad.  It's the old poor little rich girl story modernized.  Katie Holmes as the title character is quite charming but not really required to extend herself.  Final verdict is the film is decent fluff suitable for teen and pre-teen girls.  And my wife.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Love Justin's music!  Don't know what more I can say, except that I was told about it from a co-worker and couldn't wait to buy it!
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|As depicted in this film Mark O'Brien(John Hawkes) was an extraordinary man.  Despite spending the majority of his life in an iron lung unable to breathe for long stretches of time or being able to move a muscle he graduates from Berkeley and becomes a noted poet and author.  Mark is unsatisfied because at the age of 38 he is a virgin.  It's not that women don't love him because he is quite charming and has a self-deprecating sense of humor but he has not found one who is willing to consummate their love for him through sexual intercourse.  Undaunted Mark employs the service of a sexual surrogate, Cheryl Cohen Greene (Helen Hunt).  Now some would view her as a glorified prostitute as Mark's sympathetic parish priest (William H. Macy)initially does but Cheryl teaches Mark the mechanics of the sexual act but it's up to him to discover the responsibilities that go with it. \\"The Sessions\\" is a funny life affirming film.  Hawkes, Hunt, and Macy are all terrific.  A special shoutout for Moon Bloodgood who plays Mark's caregiver.  Bloodgood projects beauty, poise, and intelligence and hopefully I see her in future ventures.  Some may be turned off by the frankness of \\"The Sessions\\" but I would recommend it to the less squeamish and mature older teens who are prone to misinformation.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Jimi is awesome. I really like this cd. It works just fine and I am very happy with what I purchased.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Watching \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is akin to witnessing a court deposition with the Rolling Stones i.e. Mick Jagger testifying to their culpability in the wake of the Altamont free concert disaster.  The first half of the film is predominately live footage of the Stones Thanksgiving 1969 show at Madison Square Garden and mixing \\"Wild Horses\\" at Muscle Shoals studios.  These events go swimmingly because there is an element of control that wasn't present at Altamont.  The second half concentrates on the doomed concert.  Poor planning, change of venue at the last minute, audience that were either off their meds or self medicating, and band tardiness.  Throw in some pool cue wielding Hell's Angels acting as security and you toss the lit match at the proverbial gas tank.  Something you will never see is an obviously petrified Mick Jagger who is probably wondering how he got into this mess.  As a Stones fan I'm led to wonder how they allowed this damning film see the light of day yet they held back the release of \\"The Rolling Stones Rock 'N' Roll Circus\\" and \\"Charlie is My Darling\\" for years.  My best guess is the film serves as damage control, sympathy for the devil so to speak.  You never feel the communion between the artists and the audience that exists in Michael Wadleigh's \\"Woodstock\\".  The Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin do a terrific job capturing the atmosphere of the event.  That said there were 300,000 stories at Altamont and you feel that somehow this film is incomplete.
B005R32L66|2.0|A download fail message keeps popping up when I downloadloaded skype from the amazon app store. Would anyone know the reasoning why?

B00BUADSMQ|4.0|This film was exactly what I thought it would be. Guns, violence, bruce willis being bruce willis. I got exactly what I expected and I did enjoy it.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I could not keep up it.too many places,too many characters,and too many time zones.the actors played well in this movie and I especially liked the English and their humorbut I think I have to watch this movie for 5 times just to finally get the plot.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I love it because I love the show.  All these DVDs function properly, and have done so more than once.  If you like the show and want lots of it, I'd recommend buying it.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|It is a great game for your mind, and this app helps you exercise your brain. I love how you can change the difficulty!
B0053O89WY|5.0|All the DVDs work fine, so I love this because I love the show so much.  There is little else to say.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|For someone looking for a game with awesome detailed graphics and some brain exercising this is wonderful. If you like a good puzzle  for me this is the best game in years. I am not into the mindless killing games, so this is refreshing and complex enough to be mediative (its takes enough brain power to shut off all the other voices in my head.)
B0000AUHQT|1.0|Dvd was not playable on uk dvd the great gatsby did not state this when purchasing not able to watch
0812982622|5.0|Interesting and powerful read! The author's unique style tells a remarkable story of the life of an ordinary man in North Korea. Amazing insight, clever construction, and daring revelations all add up to an award winner. Certainly worthy of the Pulitzer Prize. This unusual work is not a quick read - it requires thoughtful reading, pondering, questioning and study as you find yourself fully engaged in every page. Well worth the investment - you will savor this reading experience.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Clicking on the tiles works flawlessly  even though they are fairly small and one has the option of choosing between two tile profiles and various configurations. It is not timed or at least I have not looked for it.
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|*Original Review 2013*<br /><br />None of our group of 9 people (adults & kids) had seen the trailer or knew anything about this movie, so we had zero expectations going into it.<br /><br />+ Yes, the visuals are perfect for the mood they are trying to create.<br /><br />+ Yes, the soundtrack adds to the mood of the scenes. I wound up getting my hands on the soundtrack later...great music.<br /><br />+ Yes, Jim Sturgess is great in his unassuming manner.<br /><br />- No, Kirsten Dunst didn't get a chance to do a lot of &#34;acting&#34; in the movie in my opinion, as she was more of a supporting role, so it could have been nearly any actress playing the part.<br /><br />+ Yes, the science/science-fiction was intriguing with the possibilities the script could have taken the story in could have been more and did in some cases. Some missed opportunity, but enough sci-fi that it adds to the plot.<br /><br />+ Yes, Timothy Spall turned out to be my kid's favorite character.<br /><br />- No, the movie didn't fill every plot hole...holes remained.<br /><br />- No, the &#34;renewed&#34; love between the characters seemed too sudden, as if they knew they needed to end the movie so the script accelerated things<br /><br />OVERALL: Beautiful movie to watch. Some tense moments. Good sci-fi / science elements. Could have done better without the rushed ending, but our entire group of five adults and some teens/kids enjoyed the movie a lot.<br /><br />*UPDATE 2015*<br />Have sense lent this movie out to others who had never heard of it. Everyone has come back saying, &#34;What a great under-rated movie. I really liked it!&#34;<br /><br />Yeah, this is not deep sci-fi, but more of a Romeo & Juliet story with some great visual futuristic dressing around it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|a great series characters are well developed and human<br /><br />becoming a bit like a soap opera<br /><br />overall ill be watching it again
B000E33VWW|4.0|The first of the two films made in 2005 about Truman Capote's writing of IN COLD BLOOD, CAPOTE got the lion's share of the critics' attention and won a Best Actor Oscar for Philip Seymour Hoffman as the eponymous writer who found the story that would make him rich in the murder of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas in 1959. Of the two films (the other being INFAMOUS, with Toby Jones), CAPOTE is the more self-consciously artistic: it has gorgeous cinematography by Adam Kimmel of the haunted and empty Kansas plains (Manitoba being used as that state's stand-in), and a truly unforgettable scene where Capote sneaks into a Holcomb funeral parlor and opens the casket of Mrs. Clutter, only to find her face (blown away by a shotgun) swathed in muslin like something mysterious and sacerdotal.<br /><br />The film is quite fine on its own terms, and has a superlative performance by Catherine Keener as the author Harper Lee, who accompanied her childhood friend Capote to Holcomb for his first long research trip and who listens with patience and forbearance to her friend's egotistical and insensitive rants. The film has a lovely sense of eerie slow pacing to it, and its focus is squarely on Capote's mercurial and conflicted character, and how his career was both made and ruined by the story, especially after he became emotionally entangled with one of the Clutters' killers, Perry Smith (an intense Clifton Collins, Jr.). Hoffman's portrayal of Capote was widely (and deservedly) praised, although he does emphasize the writer's cruelty and spoiled selfishness over his simultaneously capabilities for great charm and kindness. The filmmakers made a conscious choice to omit Capote's high life among Manhattan's cafe society, which is emphasized much more in INFAMOUS; the most grievous mistake of both films is to give any sense of life or humanity to the poor dead Clutters themselves, so that in neither film do we have enough of a sense of the monstrousness of their murders: one of the greatest achievements of IN COLD BLOOD itself is to make the Clutters almost unbearably human in the day leading up to their deaths.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|funny game can get old after a while. I wish there were levels to it, New backgrounds and area to explore.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Loved the book.  Great Characterization and I learned a lot.  I enjoyed Kite Runner but think 'And the Mountains Echoed' has many more memorable characters and it is beautifully written.  Fascinating to read the chronology of events and pair with what we know of the political climate.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Love this app! My one &amp; only problem is when I enter a text onto a picture it'll double the word and I have to discard &amp; restart. Fix this and I'll rate it a 5.<br />I'd love to see more stickers :)

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome game in the whole wide word&middot; And we want more rooms and bonus games .keep up the good work.
B004OC07F8|5.0|Some great tools in the book as well as a new perspective of the topic.  Yes, some of the thoughts are 'repackages' of earlier work, but the authors bring a fresh view of things.  I would highly recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Before I started Hopeless, I was seeing it everywhere! Every blog I stopped by was featuring Hopeless and everyone was raving about it and how amazing it was. Of course, after seeing how everyone was smitten with it, I had to give it a try. I'm sorry to say that it took me a long time to get to it, but once I did I was shocked. Like really, really shocked, so shocked I had to take a break between chapters. I honestly had not expected what I found. I was expecting a book about a bad boy meeting a good girl who pushes him away because of his tattoos or something like that.<br /><br />Hopeless was more than that, there is some pushing away but not because Sky is a good girl and Holder is a bad boy, even though he might seem scary in the first chapters. I don't want to spoil the book, because you have to experience all the feelings the book evokes. And dear good, there are a lot of feels.<br /><br />Suffice to say, I absolutely love this book! It's heart-breaking, it will no doubt make you cry your heart out, but there are moments in this book that will make you laugh out loud. I loved Sky and Holder together. Their humor, their wit and banter just added another flavor to the book. Them together was effortless, not effortless as in they didn't encounter any problems, but effortless as in they were so much alike, their relationship and feelings didn't feel forced but flowed easily and wasn't something I had a hard time getting used to. Now I'm going to sound corny, but they fit together perfectly and I loved it. It felt real.<br /><br />They both went through problem, devastating problems and discoveries that I had not seen coming. I thought I had everything figured out from the first half of the book and that I knew what the twist was. Well, what I had figured out was right, even though I didn't want it to be because it was just too horrible, but the real twist totally made me stop, cry for half an hour, and then go back to reading again.<br /><br />Hopeless is a phenomenal book and an emotional roller coaster with amazing characters. A must-read. I'm totally calling dips on Holder, the guy is just so swoon-worthy and amazing and I love him so much. He is so understanding even though he suffered a lot and went through heart-breaking things that would devastate most. So people, go buy this book! It's worth every penny!

B004JHYRDQ|5.0|Dr. Isaac Asimov has been my favorite author for over 40 years. All of his science fiction stories display brilliant insights into human nature, of which he wrote many non-fiction books. All of his fictional books are classics of the highest level and worthy of being read and re-read. They are wonderfully entertaining as well as thought provoking.

B008JFUPK8|4.0|A scientist (Russell Crowe) sends his son from his dying world to the planet Earth, where he is raised by a decent mid-Western couple (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and develops superpowers.  Self-doubting and lonely, young Clark Kent wanders aimlessly until a band of militarists, led by General Zod (Michael Shannon), arrive to subjugate Earth and use Clark in their plan to revive their dead civilization.  Superman (Henry Cavill) is born.<br /><br />This film was too long and the plot was too busy to rate a top score, but I quite enjoyed it.  Director Zack Snyder, with David Goyer and Christopher Nolan, really make an effort to get under Superman's skin here and make him more than just an overstuffed Boy Scout.  I think they are successful, but the rest of the cast, with the possible exception of his two fathers, is given little to do as a result.  Unlike many, I kind of liked the flashbacks to Clark's boyhood; we were already on familiar ground with yet another retelling of Superman's origin, and I didn't much feel like sitting through thirty minutes of his Nebraska upbringing.  However, you really can't leave Pa and Ma Kent out of it, so it seemed like a reasonable choice.  Cavill is a great Superman but it looks like we have to wait for the next movie to we see whether he is a great Clark Kent as well.  Despite going on too long, this movie presented the best representation of superpowered combat that I have yet seen.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Will not connect to Facebook. Keep getting an &quot;Error&quot; message. That is all it says is &quot;Error&quot;'. Other than that the game is fun.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|It is very good! A whole lot of information without comercials. I think it was worth buying it. I definately recomend it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Still alot of un answered questions remain and their love story isn't very passionate in this book.  Sylvia has stated they both have a lot of issues from their pasts to work thru yet.  Part of me thinks a book 4 and 5 are a bit greedy because bared to you and reflected in you were such a hit.  Why drag out the story.  I'll still get 4 and 5 most likely but compared to Shades of Grey - if a book 4 of Shades would come out now, I'd read it - even if there was a little termoil between them because I know they lived happily ever after in book three.  Book 4 and 5 for Bared to you series??  will they ever get together?  I'm not a book reviewee and I'm not an avid reader so take my review for what it is - guess I was just a little disappointed at the story line.  Maybe I should re-read it and pick up on things I perhaps missed.
B00BJZJXWG|5.0|Smooth mellow jazz-infused music that is an update from the Sade era of the 90's. From start to finish, put this on and prepare to relax.
B00B78AIV0|4.0|This book was a difficult read because of the subject matter, but well worth it.  The rich descriptions made me feel like I was right there throughout the novel. A somewhat surprise twist near the ends makes this book well worth while.

B0090KZDSK|4.0|I really enjoyed this 3rd book.  Only thing was it didn't develop the charactors any further and it was just finishing up book 2 with more of the same.  I am getting very sick of cliffhangers so nearly didn't buy the book out of spite but glad I did.

How long it lasted BEFORE being deleted from my Kindle Fire: 37 SECONDS (36 seconds too many).  Thanks for nothing but an overpriced FAOTD.
1451695195|1.0|The only thing I'm sure after reading this is that he is DEFINITELY WRITING A 2ND BOOK. AND I'M SURE SIMON AND SCHUSTER ARE RIGHT THERE ENCOURAGING IT!<br /><br />While I think his story is probably true and many of the elements inspiring, even encouraging, he does sound like a narcissist and just arrogant...\\"My NDE is different from all the others...\\" \\"I was really sick and my wife and sons were deeply worried...\\" \\"I was one of out of only 10,000 this would happen to...\\" I wanted barf.<br /><br />That said, I hope what he says is true, believe that it probably is...and I look forward to a spiritual journey similar to his but like religion, the only acceptable answer right now for me is \\"I don't know.\\"<br /><br />But, at the end of the day, this book and his motives, at least in part, and Simon & Schusters, in whole, is about making money.<br /><br />MARK MY WORDS, DEFINITELY A 2ND BOOK COMING...and I won't be reading it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|love it, best show ever, for a long while. will get the rest. can't wait to see what's next. Yay.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|I've been collecting Blu-ray 3D movies (except for the animations) and the 3D effect for this movie is so well done. This is a lot better (and lot cheaper for sure) than even a front row at a live show. For example, there are several underwater shots showing the actors after they jump in the water. You don't usually get to see these on live shows. Also there are a lot of slow motion shots (using high speed cameras) that are simply stunning. You definitely can't see that on live shows.<br /><br />The show itself is no less amazing. I've seen a lot of shows but there are a lot of new stunts and new concepts in this show. Half way through the show, I already came up with a list of friend whom I'll invite home to see this.<br /><br />BTW, my home theater features a 3D projector and a 160&#34; screen. I can't say how it looks on a much smaller 3D TV.

B009XIXVU6|2.0|I liked Hosseini's other two books much better.  I found this one hard to follow. I felt the plot &#34;jump&#34; around a lot.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|My wife and I got hooked on the books, and then once we learned that HBO made a show out of it we had to watch.  We watched season one in about a day and a half.  Then we had to wait sooo long for this to come out.  So worth it!  Just keeps getting better and better!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Blu-ray release has solid video quality (with tons of grain because that's the way the producers intended), sharp images, and no compression defects. The audio is as good as the video, and the special features are depth enough for the hardcore fans.<br /><br />Totally Recommended
0062059963|4.0|My rating: 4.25/5<br /><br />I really should have read this series in the correct order because I did feel a little confused about the selection and Americas background. But it was not too difficult to follow. I liked the idea of the competition to become the next princess and that it wasn't just about who looks the best for the prince. The tasks were quite interesting and I was especially proud of America when she spoke out about the unfairness of the castes.<br /><br />In terms of Maxon and Aspen, I was team aspen until the end. I couldn't help But doubt Maxon's character. Aspen is so genuine and understanding but then Maxon has so much responsibility and pressure on him so maybe that's why he behaves as he does. Plus he did take care of Marlee after her severe punishment and exile...<br /><br />I believe that America has the potential to make a change if she wins, she certainly has the drive and determination to want things to change but in order to win she needs to fight the odds against her, which includes the King's dislike.<br /><br />Celeste is clearly too scheming and manipulative. Kriss is sweet and it's sad she's in love with Maxon; she really would make a brilliant second choice.<br /><br />The Elite was definitely interesting, and had the reality-show-turned-TV-series feel to it. There was plenty of drama, and whilst most girls were fiercely competing for Maxon's attentions, America was fighting within herself to decide what she truly desires. Now that she finally realises the extent to which Maxon will suffer for her, I fear the evil king will do something to ruin America's chances.<br /><br />Favourite Quotes:<br /><br />\\"I know,\\" I said, placing a hand on his chest, letting myself forget for a moment all that we were risking. \\"But that doesn't change where we are or that I'm an Elite now. I need time, Aspen.\\"<br />He reached up to hold my hand in his and nodded. \\"I can give you that. Just...try to find some time for me, too.\\"<br /><br />Time. I was asking for a lot of it these days. I hoped that if I had enough, everything would somehow fall into place.<br /><br />In truth, I hadn't even thought about Aspen in the last week or so. I was so consumed by my mistimed words and mistaken guesses, I couldn't consider anything else. And here, while I'd been worried about Maxon, letting me go, Aspen had been worrying about me doing the same to him.<br /><br />\\"And if you don't get to be princess then, so what? That doesn't make you any less incredible. And you know...you know...\\" He couldn't get out what he wanted to say, and I risked looking at his face.<br />In Aspen's eyes I saw a thousand different endings to that sentence, all of them connecting him to me. That he was still waiting for me. That he knew me better than anyone. That we were the same. That a few months at the palace couldn't erase two years. No matter what, Aspen would always be there for me.<br />\\"I know, Aspen. I do.\\"<br /><br />I signed. \\"Actually, Mom, we argue pretty regularly.\\"<br />\\"What?\\" She gaped at me. \\"Well, stop it!\\"<br />\\"Oh, and I kneed him in the groin once.\\"There was a split second of silence before May barked a laugh. She covered her mouth and tried to stop, but it kept coming out in awkward, squeaky sounds. Dad's lips were pressed together, but I could tell he was on the verge of losing it himself. Mom was paler than snow.<br />\\"America, tell me you're joking. Tell me you didn't assault the prince.\\"<br />I didn't know why, but the word assault pushed us all over the edge; and May, Dad and I bent over laughing as Mom stared at us.<br /><br />He shrugged. \\"It's just the way it is. The sky is blue, the sun is bright, and Aspen endlessly loves America. It's how the world was designed to be...\\"<br /><br />I was determined to pour myself into this and hopefully produce something that might genuinely make a difference. Maybe I'd still lose in the long run; maybe I wouldn't even want to win. But I would be as close to a princess as I possibly could, and I would make my peace with the Selection.<br /><br />America, he'd said, I don't think you can change history. To which I replied, Sure we can. Besides, who'd ever know about it but you and me?<br /><br />I wiped the tears away and assessed the situation. I was done with Maxon, but I was still here. I was done with the competition, but I still had a presentation due. Aspen might not think I was tough enough to be a princess- and he was right- but he did have faith in me. I knew that. And so did my father. And so did Nicoletta.<br />I wasn't here to win anymore. So how could I go out with a bang?<br /><br />This was it. This was good-bye.<br />\\"You've changed me forever. And I'll never forget you.\\" I ran my free hand down his chest, straightening his coat.<br />\\"Don't tug your ear with anyone else. That's mine.\\" I gave him a tight smile.<br />\\"A lot of things are yours, America.\\"<br /><br />\\"...You were the one who changed us when you left me in the tree house; and you keep thinking that if you push hard enough, you can make everything go back to before that moment. It doesn't work that way. Give me a chance to choose you.\\"
B000HKYA1I|5.0|I think this is one case where the film version is better than the book for any number of reasons, though to be fair, the charismatic performance of Eugene Hutz gives the film an advantage from the start. Also, the parts that are deleted from the book don't hurt the story but rather help to give it more narrative and emotional focus.  I read the book first and liked it (although I am not a huge fan of the author's)and expected to like the movie, but ended up loving it. I have seen it about three or four times now and find it more moving each time. A lot of the credit for that goes to Schreiber, who is clearly not only a gifted actor but a skilled, creative director as well.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I never read the book,, so this was my first introduction to the story It was good I like it
B005ZO6NRA|4.0|We enjoy these kind of movies. There was plenty of action with a lot of gory sword fights. Didn't know many of the actors
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game! I found it challenging and fun. I am looking forward to new levels.  Give it a try!
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I've played many alaware games on my kindle fire HD but this one has been the most frustrating. First, it's CONSTANTLY crashing, which is bothersome. Then it took forever to download (is this a new thing? I didn't have this problem with BOC or ST, etc...) when it finally started it took 3 taps for those butterflies to appear.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Really enjoyed this story.  The characters were interesting and easy to become interested in how each life interacted with another.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a very touching story. After reading it, u  realize that there are some people out there who aren't as fortunate as us. U should be thankful for what u have.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This review is for the free app.  Doesn't have as many sounds as the paid app and has ads, but the following review still stands.<br /><br />This is a good app with many variations to help anyone sleep or even just to relax.<br /><br />This app has a many sounds and there's even a screen for adjusting the binaurals beats (beating tones between ears) for relaxing or sleeping and which type of sleep your looking for.<br /><br />Whether you're looking for Deep meditation, Dream sleep, Dreamless sleep, concentration, relaxation &/or pre-sleep, you can set the binaural beats to your specific needs.<br /><br />Once you set up your binaural beats and the sounds (and individual volume levels) you can save them for later use. It also comes with a few already set up for you.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to everyone, young and old, it doesn't matter.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I find this game very refreshing to my brain, great way to use the logical side of your mind. this is a must have
B000VYNYN0|5.0|Tho I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with many a laugh I do prefer Army of Darkness.<br /><br />This is/will be one of those campy cult films that have you relaxing while watching and laughing til you cry.  The effects (tho said on IMDB, you can see wires)  I don't watch movies to pick them apart, tho I do enjoy reading the trivia from IMDB while watching movies for (sometimes) interesting facts.<br /><br />This movie along with it's sequels really doesn't really require any thought process, it's more of a kick your feet up, sit back and vegg out movies and enjoy for what it is.<br /><br />It is best to watch them in order to better understand the characters.  Even still I highly recommend this movie for some laughs especially with friends over to help with the chuckles, they may see something you missed while wiping your eyes.<br /><br />Enjoy !!!!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|MAGIC MIKE...I watched it and I liked it...BUT...ahhh, I'll tell ya'll later. (lol) I can see why the ladies enjoyed this one...Channing Tatum, Mattew McConaughey, Joe Manganiello, and the rest of the crew...pretty much ALMOST naked. (lol) While watching this...I felt chubby and that I needed to visit the gym soon. (lol) MAGIC MIKE kind of reminded me of BOOGIE NIGHTS...instead of porn...it was male strippers.  Now dudes! I'm talking to you. It's just not a male stripping movie. It's got hot chicks, boobs, drugs, AND the beautiful Olivia Munn...which was a total surprise to me. A very nice surprise. (lol)<br /><br />Dudes...if you haven't seen it with your girl yet - do it. You just might get lucky. (lol)<br /><br />NOW...for what I didn't like. THE ENDING. Yep - be prepared...I thought the ending totally blew. It just ends. I was like, \\"WTF?! It's just going to end like that?!\\" But...I hear their making a Part 2 so...I guess it'll start from there. (lol)<br /><br />I give MAGIC MIKE... 3 out of 5 popcorns. It's a fun, raunchy comedy.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This review is for the paid app.  I paid the small sum to get the extra sounds.<br /><br />This is a great app with many variations to help anyone sleep or even just to relax.<br /><br />This app has a great many sounds and there's even a screen for adjusting the binaurals beats (beating tones between ears) for relaxing or sleeping and which type of sleep your looking for.<br /><br />Whether you're looking for Deep meditation, Dream sleep, Dreamless sleep, concentration, relaxation &/or pre-sleep, you can set the binaural beats to your specific needs.<br /><br />Once you set up your binaural beats and the sounds (and individual volume levels) you can save them for later use.

Luv the purring kitty sound, I feel asleep with the Kindle on my chest and could almost feel a kitty sleeping and purring away, lol.
B008220D5K|4.0|THIS IS 40 - just like the DVD cover says... \\"Laugh-Out-Loud-Funny\\"....that person was right. I laughed from the beginning...all the way to the end. If you're a fan of KNOCKED UP...you should watch THIS IS 40.<br /><br />Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann are great together. Leslie Mann...HOT. HOT. If you need more hotness...Megan Fox is in this. HOT. HOT. HOT...and she does good. THIS IS 40 is definately worth a watch - it's a funny movie.<br /><br />I give THIS IS 40... 3 1/2 out of 5 popcorns!
159463176X|5.0|Riveting plot  told with masterful skills of story telling.  It will break your heart at times and challenge you to ponder deeply about your relationships with those you love.  &#34;And the mountains echoed&#34; is truly another triumph by Hosseini.

B0084U0IEG|1.0|About half way through the book i realized the main character is a dimwitted and boring, the story is superficial and absurd and the book is a waste of time.  I found the ending gimmicky and dishonest and that the author is more focused on trying to be &#34;creative&#34; that writing a good book.

1781162646|5.0|I'd been looking for a good, NEW crime novel written during one of my favorite time periods: the early-70s. The references to pop culture and the simplicity of those old carnivals that used to travel around the country back then brought back the smell of popcorn, sound of rides and laughs of kids. I related to Devin Jones on a personal level, because when I was 20, I had a very similar falling out with my \\"first love\\". I feel that King understands the torment of being someone unwise to the ways of life in your early 20s. The characters were loveable. It took a little long for the crime aspect to start taking off (roughly 100 pages in it becomes more prevalent), but it was hard to put down. Now that I've finished it, I'm looking for more books in the Hard Case Crime series to pick up.<br /><br />Joyland reminded me of why we all have gone into at least one Stephen King phase in our reading lives, it was good to see he can churn out a straight-forward, moderately long story on par with his earliest work.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is so awesome as Sherlock. Stylistically it's gorgeous. I don't think I've ever seen a better adaptation. Brilliant!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Interesting account of the some of the people on all four sides, both before and during WW II in Europe.
1451695195|5.0|A very enjoyable and educational read.  Hard to put down.  I read it twice and bought a copy as a present.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Good diversion from the real world that shows how Star Trek evolved over the years. I saw the show creator, Gene Roddenbury in college and was convinced that he was half Vulcan.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|He did it again.  This book is a TEN!  Fast paced action from page one till the very end.  As we all know, a lot of books can get somewhat descriptive making the avid reader skip paragraphs or pages.  Not this book.  Did not skip a word.  So fast moving.  Wish they would make a movie
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This program is great because of the acting.  There are no broadway-type performances - the actors are never \\"playing to the balcony.\\"  It makes a big difference to the viewer if you never have to ask, \\"who talks like that?\\"  A comparison: in the program \\"Body of Proof,\\" the main actor over performs her role, she is not believable and, as a viewer, you just don't buy her in the role of a well respected doctor.<br /><br />The Good Wife has a solid cast and terrific guest stars.  Example, Mamie Gummer is fantastic as the ditzy blonde lawyer who is ultimately not ditzy at all, and Carrie Preston deserves an Emmy for her role as lawyer Elsbeth Tascioni.  She could WAY overact this role, but she plays it just right.  The occasional guest appearances of Michael J. Fox are a guarantee of a lively courtroom battle between he and Julianna Margulies.<br /><br />If your not currently up-to-date with the Good Wife, get Amazon Prime and watch seasons 1-3, which are included in a Prime Membership.  Warning!  You're gonna get hooked.
B001FA0NZ6|5.0|Bobbi's experience and talent definitely comes through in this book of hers.  I've actually met her and this book puts into words the talent, methods and techniques she displays on her clients. I would recommend this book to anybody, whether you are an expert or just getting started as a young person learning to apply makeup.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|My kid's enjoyed it, they thought it started slow but kept them watching. My wife and I enjoyed it as well.
B0052UYJDC|1.0|While intellectually I understand why some people may feel the need to divest themselves of everything they own in the name of minimalism to satisfy their emotional needs, this book goes beyond what one wants to read about.  I thought I was purchasing a book to help me downsize a little, but this books literally preaches that one should nearly get rid of everything you own.  It propagates living like a miser or a pauper and not in a good way.  Not at all what I wanted to read about. I have no desire to live like a monk.  Thank you very much.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|First off I was as put off as many on the whole \\"extending the storyline\\" ordeal. I signed up for a trilogy in 2010 and I dont appreciate the extension. BUT when I actually read the story it wasn't as bad as I thought. I can deal with a HFN for Eva and Gideon. But truth be told I could not possible care less about the rest of those people. Samantha Young did it right, she did a SPINOFF... this is what should have happened, novella style preferrably. Dont force people to endure characters, let your fans decide if you sold them enough to care about their stories. FYI No I wouldnt buy a single one of those stories, I signed up for EVA and GIDEON, the end. So with that being said the CROSSFIRE TRILOGY is just that for me, I wont be buying anymore because for me the story ended with I DO.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I loved this book.  It made me laugh, it made me cry, but always made me think.  After reading this book, I realized how supremely accurate the author is when is describes how different people relate to love.  It had never dawned on me before how certain people respond to certain ways of expressing love.  For that matter, it never dawned on me until I read it, what, exactly, makes me feel most loved.  I would recommend this read to anybody who is breathing.  Everybody in the world should benefit from learning how to appreciate and love somebody else in a way that *they* feel appreciated or loved.  I think we'd have fewer wars, fewer divorces, and a lot more peace if this was required reading in school.  It's not a religious book; it's not preachy at all, but is God based.  However, no matter what your belief system is, or if you don't even have one, this book is strictly about how learn to treat people around you, not what to believe.  I highly recommend it.
B008220DGE|3.0|I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, and I don't feel like any of them were very well developed.  I enjoyed some of the performances nonetheless.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So far this is a fun game. Not too difficult that you want to throw your Kindle against the wall, but keeps you searching for the clues.
B006ISJQ26|4.0|I enjoyed the acting, and although the storyline was routine, the characters were quirky enough to make it a bit unique and enjoyable.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Excellent book!  Just saw the movie and knew it would be different, but I loved the way that the book set the movie up so I knew what was going on.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|I love the mystery about this story; and I enjoyed the performances.  It's one of those films that requires that you stick with it until the end.
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|I don't review music I lack the poetic vocabulary.. But after listening to this album I felt I needed to say something about it. These guys have been around and they have seen the world and experienced it fully perhaps too much. I believe they have something to say about their lives and what they have seen this time around. I cant say they are virtuoso's but they do it with the skills and voice they have. There was no need to wrap this up in some phony glitz to sell it.. This album is a warning to those who are willing to listen and learn from the older and wiser. The production is simple and solid. Your world view is gonna get rocked.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery ate the best!!!  Was excited to finally see this one and give it to my son!!!!
B00328G4V6|3.0|This one is a fans-only recording. It's Hendrix and the recording is pretty clean but that's about it. Yet another previously unreleased version of Red House that's not too shabby but it's more of a practice jam than a song anyone is going to be playing again and again. Sunshine Of Your Love? Really, why not add a track of the band tuning instruments? Some familiar riffs in there that Hendrix fans will be able to match with the tunes they belong to. Bottom line, it's a jam that happened to end up recorded and is now an new album. Or not.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited 6 months for this book to come out and when it did, it's such a disappointment because it's not the last book in the series and appearantly there are 2 more books after this book. She wasted haft the book explained what happened in the first two books. Every thing was so redundant in this book.  Furthermore,  I hate the fact that the publisher selling this series as trilogy when it's not at all!!  I love the first two books and was hoping that she will finish the series in this book but that is not the case :-(
B008JFUR10|5.0|For someone who likes action films, this is serious end of the world realistic acting on a level worthy of saveing the human race.
B000TDDIC0|5.0|The fidelity on this download was fantastic. Timeless music from one of music's most creative and talented performers. In my opinion, one of Bowie's very best works.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I think this game is really cool and fun.<br />I think this game is fun because it is really hard and kinda easy.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|A funny, light movie.  Barbara Streisand was fabulous; she such a good singer, I had forgotten how funny she can be.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is the best white the new update there is a new hero/New maps and it is freaking awesome
B005LAII12|1.0|This is exactly what I expected from Seth MacFarlane -- a film with a completely uninteresting plot, uses racist remarks for shock value humor, poorly written jokes (that rely to much on the fact that a stuffed bear is delivering them) and other forms of ineptitude. The only thing that makes this watchable is genuine concern that MacFarlane would mishandle solid performers like Joel McHale and Mark Wahlberg.
B0091REZMW|4.0|just started this game. so far it's a good game. loaded it on my kindle for a 4 yr old to play to keep him occupied.
B00881PTRC|1.0|Isn't the old hangman I am used to. Don't enjoy this version. Don't like it. Would love to know how to get  this off my Kindle.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Having barely survived a number of losses in the past two years, i can sense just how true these extreme (and obsessive) behaviors are after a loss.<br />My friend who recommended it wondered if I might be too deep in grief myself to enjoy it.  But i absolutely loved it!  Watching these wild & wacky antics was very cathartic for me.  Moreover, i think it rings true with anyone who has suffered a deep loss.<br />So for anyone looking for entertainment, from light-hearted romance and comedy to serious probes into obsession and loss, this one is a must see.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4! Didn't think PBS could create a drama in a British setting with such draw. Well done!
B007W8S2MG|4.0|I've been playing video games as a serious gamer for 30 years and have never liked RPG at all, until this game. I've been playing this intensely for about 2 weeks and even though the combat mechanics are confusing and repetitive (and remind me of everything I hate about RPG), the storyline itself is fascinating enough to keep me going. You play as a high school student whom you name yourself and, together with up to 7 other playable characters, try to solve a series of murders. The story takes place from April 2011 to March 2012 but all but a tiny part of the story is done by Christmas 2011. Like all good RPGs you get different endings depending on the choices you make. You spend a lot of time passing the days doing chores or earning money or talking to friends. The gameplay is repetitive but there's enough variety and humor to keep me going, and I'd never imagined I'd be hooked on an RPG!<br /><br />The game is massive and totally worth the price and time.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Not a better show on tv right now. I look forward to season 3, but the unlimited streaming version! Pumped!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like the convenience, although the initial downloading instructions were confusing and frustrating. However, now I'm up and running and it's great! I love my tablet and this app just makes it better.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game wasn't to confusing and wasn't to easy. it was just between the to. but there were a couple of levels that were hard.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Was very surprised by the plot line and kept you in suspense all the way through.  Never figured out the end game until I got there.  A very unique book since it investigates what happens after the bad guy wins
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|If 5 is perfect than this movie is close.  A good family movie.  The language and scenes were not offensive.
B000W176VS|5.0|Joni Mitchell's 14th album Night Ride Home is one of my all-time favorite albums alongside Van Morrison's Saint Dominic's Preview, David Bowie's Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust, the Beatles Abby Road and Sting's the Soul Cages and Mercury Falling. It is an excellent June/July album in particular because of the title track Night Ride Home, originally titled \\"Fourth of July.\\"
B00CF34B2I|5.0|i love this game don't have any friends to play anymore so this is amazing if you play at all then i would totally recommend this game for anyone
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This wasn't in the theatre for long so I wasn't sure it would be any good. I thought it was a very fun movie. The characters were nicely balanced, which is something you don't usually see. (Example: the king had his flaws, but he also had his good points. I hate when writers create 1-dimensional characters). The heroes were likable, the plot was interesting, and all-in-all, it was an entertaining couple of hours.
B00571F26Y|5.0|What the recommendations in the book did result in for us was that we simply feel better and the weight loss is gradual.  I strongly recommend another book to accompany this one; &#34;The Virgin Diet&#34; by JJ Virgin<br />-<br />Dr. Davis makes a strong argument for starting out by eliminating wheat aka gluten in your diet completely for life.  There is a lot of information out there for wheat flour based recipe substitutes that aren't bad tasting and more are surfacing with the proliferation of knowledge regarding what Monsanto et al have done to this once innocent grain and it's effects on the modern human gut.  We have been &#34;wheat free&#34; for only two weeks now and the difference is profound.  Some long standing aches and pains have disappeared completely and we simply feel better overall.  The aging process is bad enough in and of itself without a catalyst like wheat eroding you from the inside out.<br />-<br />It's a couple of bucks for something that could improve your quality of life and extend it.  I strongly recommend this to anyone who is simply feeling &#34;run down&#34; despite living and eating healthfully.  Maybe it's the whole grain goodness!  5 Stars plus 1.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|...but this movie left me feeling that something was missing. Lincoln is by far my favorite president, and the acting and cinematography were superlative, but I thought there were far too many &#34;this is a great speech&#34; moments, and not enough storytelling. Maybe that was the whole point...to highlight the man himself. If that was the point, it was a success. It just wasn't necessarily as interesting to watch as some other historical movies I've seen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun time waster. use clues to advance. not super hard but does challenge at times. looking forward to new levels.
B001UGDYO2|3.0|I had already seen it and accidently ordered it to own tryed to get help online but there was none!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Loved it. I don't personally care about the old or new Star Wars divide. It is a well made series.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|Random thoughts:<br />some of the acting is quite good, some a bit over the top.  Some of the sex is explicatory, some gratuitous.  What makes this hard to watch is that I don't find any &#34;heroes&#34; just a lot of basically unethical, villainous, greedy, conniving people.  Thomas More has principles, and sticks to them at the cost of his family's lives as well as his own, and his willingness to stick to principle is admirable, until one considers the principles themselves (Rome trumps England in religious correctness) as suspect, and his view that he will be rewarded in heaven as a detraction.  Katherine is at least a sympathetic character, but basically a wimp.  It would be nice to root for someone instead of not caring what harm (and it is mostly harm) befalls a character.  Maybe this is just what English royalty and courtiers were/ are about, in which case this displays it quite well.  But I enjoyed learning about this watching Downton Abbey.<br />And thought the More story better done in the Wind and the Lion.
B000002KOQ|4.0|You could say this was the last of Joni's \\"naive hippie waif\\" records.  The next year's BLUE would be a quantum leap forward...into Bohemia.  That's not to say that LADIES OF THE CANYON is without its very real charms, but by the next record, those sunshiney ladies with their hand-woven clothes, fat babie and fresh baked brownies would be replaced by Bohemian drifters and rogues and other denizens of those \\"dark cafes.\\"<br /><br />The Woodstock dream so clearly articulated in Joni's 1970 anthem of that name would be replaced by a more worldy skepticism when 1971 found her \\"sitting in a park in Paris, France..\\" and realizing that \\"they won't give peace a chance/that was just a dream some of us had.\\"  But it was a NICE dream while it lasted, and Joni (who famously did NOT go to Woodstock) expressed the vision of a Woodstock Nation about as well as anyone could.<br /><br />LADIES OF THE CANYON was then something of a transitional album.  It was also something of a grab-bag.  She finally put down a version of \\"Circle Game,\\" a song recorded several years before by folk luminaries such Tom Rush and Buffy Sainte-Marie.  She wound up throwing in a track written for a film (\\"The Arrangement\\") which didn't make the cut for the acutal film, but she opted to include it here (maybe not the wisest decision after all, but that's just me).<br /><br />The record also boasts another two songs that were destined to become touchstones in Joni's career--\\"For Free\\" and \\"Big Yellow Taxi.\\"  They are both instantly likeable, perhaps for different reasons.  \\"For Free\\" is one of the earlier expressions of liberal, hipster artistic guilt over actually playing for MONEY.  It's a theme, Joni would revisit on MINGUS and elsewhere.  But \\"For Free's\\" naivete is particularly affecting.  It has the hallmarks of a recent realization--no real jadedness about it.<br /><br />\\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" maybe doesn't hold up quite as well, maybe just because it's been done to death by other people.  And I NEVER cared for the forced laugh at the end.  But it was another step forward for Joni thematically.  It's as though she were beginning to get that it wasn't just a matter of seeing things from both sides now.  On this record, she was starting to view things from SEVERAL sides.
B005DD7H50|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  The acting was not great but it was good and the storyline was very entertaining.  Several twists and turns added to the entertainment.  Never quite sure how it would turn out until the very end.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I've read plenty of NA books, but this is one of the great ones. Drew is hilarious, hearing a man be so honest about being a pig. I think he is a good guy DEEP down, look at him with Mackenzie. That relationship between uncle and niece- priceless. Kate is ambitious,beautiful ,pretty much perfect. Together they are hot,hot. Loved this book!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This is a lovely story and a beautifully filmed version. Bravo!  I'll be ordering the soundtrack as well- the music will be wonderfull to paint by,if you loved this....make sure to see, Wuthering Heights with Juliette Binoche.
B009VB97EY|3.0|It was okay, not my cup of tea. I would not watch this again. I'm more in to syfi. Later.
B00CAJMGDI|4.0|As mentioned, I'm not really a fan of classical music, but Stirling's got major talent and great sound, and I forget to miss having lyrics to sing along with...
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I wouldn't download it again. Might watch it on TV though. It was predictable, the one twist was the making of the wicked witch.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|good. fun. avoidence game like temple run. my son loves it even though playing it while kindle is charging slow the refresh speed at times
B005544V6A|5.0|Fun, smart drama, with cool characters and a lot of action although not true to reality...law just isn't that interesting.
B008Y7DV70|3.0|Interesting but not the mind bending, make you think scifi I thought it would be. The acting was good but I like scifi shows that force you to be still thinking about them the next day.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|These guys are always cutting edge and great sound.<br />Their first album was great also and they have a sound that stands out from the crowd .
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Simply the most well-though out and organized workout I've ever read.  This book is also the most universal workout I've ever seen since it applies to you whether you can't do a single push-up (there are wise ways of working up to that) or whether you are a hard-core athlete who wants to do the most intense, impressive feats of strength (like one-armed push-ups and pull-ups).<br /><br />I'd recommend it to someone in their 70s or anyone in their 20s.<br /><br />The only thing missing in my mind is cardio –– that's not the focus –– but for a guide to strength-building this is genius!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game. Can't wait for the rest of the rooms.<br /><br />This game was a lot of fun. Finding clues. Solving puzzles. Room 10 took some figuring.<br />Can't wait for more rooms to be released.
030758836X|3.0|This was a decent read. A little wordy but it was so suspense filled that it was one of those books that you really don't want to put down. This author does a great job at tying every thread together. That's why the end was a disappointment. The end was not a full blown cliff hanger nor was it a solid statement. Vague.It's not that it was a bad story, I just think that there was so much built up to the end, that I expected more. Overall it was ok.
B00CO52NLI|1.0|I  downloaded this app earlier today , and immediately after installing it , my LG Optimus android phone froze and died.<br />This app turned my phone into a useless brick.<br />Please beware, I would caution anyone who values their phone to not download this app!!
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|Very well done. Definitely not a disappointment. Very gruesome just the way we like it  Can't wait for evil dead 2
B009R659L8|5.0|I have always loved Mary Higgins Clark's books and this one is no different. Good characters, good plot and story, great ending!
B00969PR18|3.0|I am having a hard time navigating the app. I have read the help information and still can not find the rout information in print, only the map with a line on it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Missed the first three seasons on PBS; have watched each episode of all three seasons. Love the costumes and the evolution of thoughts as the years pass. Isn't that what we experience in 2013?????
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Addictive, I will recommend it to my friends. A great way to pass time when I am not busy.<br />My wife plays it too.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Again this is great interactive item, my grandaughter loves it. its like her own voice talking to repeat everything she says, her laughter is a joy for me to hear
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham is a very skilled  author he writes his stories with twists and  Turns it keep you on the edge of your seat
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Exciting series with unexpected twists and turns.  At the end of each program I tell myself &#34;I'll watch just one more.&#34;
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Too obvious , too invasive and Damocles' sword hanging over your privacy,<br /><br />It exposes you , your family and friends for no good service..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is one of the best games I play. I thought this game was going to be bad but one of my friends said I was going to be good.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Kevin Spacey!!!!!  While Ian Richardson was so devilishly good in the original, Spacey really fleshes out the part.  You actually root for his evil party whip character.  Robin Wright and Corey Stoll are terrific.  The musical score by Jeff Beal is haunting -  I bought it for my iPod.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Good job on this one Child. Reacher is one bad A and I hpoe to read many more . Keep them coming..
B002X4OKRK|2.0|The original Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory was much more believable in the real life scenes.  And Johnny Depp was a bad choice for Willy Wonka.  I really like him in most of his other movies but the part he played in this movie was poorly written.
B00BY1F8UQ|3.0|The item delivered came in excellent condition. The product output was a disappointment. The song selections and renditions by  Keith Jarrett and his trio will be on the low end of my Jarrett collections.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Premise for story was interesting and the whole time I was kept guessing as to how it would turn out.
B00BXUG0KU|3.0|I love the way Elias plays (piano)  but her singing can be a turnoff. She has limited success with her voice but when she puts her fingers on the keyboard she's a genius with unlimited talent.
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|Having read the book I wondered how they would edit the story to fit but I was not disappointed.  I am curious how somebody would rate the movie if they haven't read the book. The movie is filmed as a sort of play/movie hybrid that I actually enjoyed very much.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It's well written and a wonderful story. Can't put it down. Looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Loved it more then any of his others.  Read it and research it yourself.  The stories about our contries landmarks are realy true.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Still watching.  Rose and Martha are my favorite companions..not sure about Donna tho.  Starting on the next season (5) soon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a great book but I do not recommend it to kids under the age of 11. It has a surprising ending and it has a lot of scary details for little kids. But overall, it is my favorite book.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over. It's one that I will pick out to see again and again. The actors play their parts with excitement and makes the movie intriguing at every turn!
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I love all Ms. Singh's books but this one is a masterpiece. I loved the storyline and was much moved by the characters.
B006FE83UE|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird Bird is a classic.  Everyone should see it!  The DVD is great and included bonus features.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Feels like older king from the 80's -- which is a good thing in my opinion.  Fun plot line and great characters.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I love, love, loved Bared to You and really enjoyed Reflected in You. I looked forward to the completion of the series in Entwined with You. Was I disappointed! This book throws in a bunch of new twists that totally detract from the story, only to string it along further. Ugh! Now I feel used and insulted; used for my money that the publisher wants me to spend on buying more books to complete the series and insulted that the publisher thinks that it's ok to string me, as a romance novel reader, along. Well, you've lost me now, Penguin Publishing. Happy?
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game achieves what few other games ever have: it is both interesting and relaxing. I can enjoy it almost any time and place. It makes a nice distraction when you have a few minutes to relax. Highly recommended!
B000007WOP|5.0|This is one of my favorite records of all time. I love every song on Urban Hymns. There is a feeling you get when you listen to this that's hard to explain unless you've heard it.<br />And to now have it on vinyl is the icing on the cake. It sounds fantastic and I would recommend this to all you other audiophiles out there. It truly sounds incredible!<br />This is easily one of the best records of the last 20 years and will be a classic.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game kept me busy on my flight. Pretty good and addicting. Appreciate the developers for this game and easy to use and enjoyment
B003O97J26|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much when I saw it in the theater that I bought a copy. Unfortunately I somehow misplaced it & discovered it was missing when I sat down to watch it.  So, I had no choice but to buy another copy.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Great game! So far all of the g5 games have been fun to play. I just wish you could go further in the game before having to fully purchase.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Schwarzenegger still can't act worth a crap (sorry) but it was still a very good movie. I think he tries to hard to spit a line out...I wish he'd relax and just say the line...even if it isn't perfect English!<br />That aside...I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie...very entertaining. One part that did irritate me was: Why does a Sheriff \\"have something special\\" just because he KNEW and SAW a bridge being built? They acted like that was such a \\"discovery\\"..he WITNESSED something...whoopty-doo! That small piece made them look stupid. Yes, I'm nit-picking...but it irritates me how they will put something so stupid (however minute) in a good movie like that. Anywho...I hadn't planned on watching this (cause Schwarzenegger can't act) but the reviews drew me in....and I'm glad I did.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This calculator has made so many of the things I do so much easier. So many of the things  I do require math sometimes in multiple ways it has made such a difference. From adjusting  my recipes,  figuring out needed stitch count for my knitting and crocheting, or  measurements for jewelry and sewing creations.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|A lot of action in this movie! More of a man flick! Although my hubby and I both enjoyed it!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|These songs bring back great memories of how I used to groove to them as a kid and by the way my son reacts when I put them on, he will probably probably build similar ones.  It's just timeless music!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great depiction of the period, excellent acting by all the cast. Just a very good series! Hope to see more like this in the future from PBS.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best show's to hit USA's shores. Funny, Charming, and enjoyable for the whole family. Can't wait for season 4.
1603427244|5.0|A book that has been needed for a long time. I will need it by my side everytime I start a new project
B0076DELIG|4.0|When Bosch decides to pursue a case, he's like a bulldog that won't let go.  While some of the twists are a bit contrived, it all comes together in a satisfying ending.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Rating is simple... Bon Jovi does not put out a bad cd ... Its a great mix of ballads and rock and roll!
B00CISC2DA|4.0|The sixth release from this Scottish duo, and their first in eight years, finds them still firmly<br />  entrenched as avant-progressive bleepmeisters.  These are dark, hauntingly experimental<br />  electronic soundscapes that evolve fluidly into epic ambient beat journeys.  It's an alien world of<br />  beauty and wonder that's more than a little scary, made of unidentifiable sounds that project a<br />  simultaneous sense of quietly tumultuous chaos and a brittle-but-warm, inviting fragility.  Recalls<br />  artists like Aphex Twin, Four Tet, Sigur Ros, Shackleton, The Future Sound of London, Benoit<br />  Pioulard, Plaid, Explosions in the Sky.  Sort of like strolling barefoot, with angelic confidence and<br />  authority, over a desolate, ice-painted wasteland.  Gorgeously eerie.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This move is a shocker and I love the twist invovling the well know green skinned bad witch.  I would tell every Wizard of Oz fan to watch.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|Not the best Reacher but good.  Slower than most Reacher but plot different and engaging. Worth the read for continuity.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love it, kept me glued on sofa... The characters are well developed, overall a Must watch! Harvey Spector seems real...
B00A757EFW|5.0|I tried beating the game it has no point. It's just a stupid game. all you ever do is eat cheaper this sucks.I'm telling all my friend add not to buy this I t thought this was a good game bad game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A little bit of a challenge, should take you around 30 minutes to complete. Only 12 levels so far. Should be getting more soon
B00CW665VI|5.0|An easy, enjoyable, funny read! One of the funniest books I've read! I'm looking forward to more from the Tangled Series!
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|This book presented me with several &#34;aha!&#34;, moments when Taubes explained the relationship between carbohydrates and fat storage.  His studies of long ago cultures and the weight and nutrition factors that kept those people overweight but malnourished also bear scrutiny.  The low carbohydrate regimen of eating is a way of life that I personally am seriously considering.  I have read the latest book out on the Atkins Diet and this book does it's best to make low carbohydrate eating as simple and painless as possible - but no doubt I'll be craving mashed potatoes by the 3rd week!
B00AK57N00|4.0|a simple game but yet so addictive. the wind and gravity makes the game interesting in a way yet it gets so annoying at times
B008C20TDG|4.0|This is a good book to get you inspired to eat and live a healthier lifestyle. I couldn't do all of it but it gave me a lot of ideas on how to eat healthy.  I browse through whenever I get a craving for processed foods.
B005K17RU0|4.0|great weather app! but i wish the app had more colors to distinguish the icons for rainy days, sunny days, cloudy days, etc.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I immediately loved this series. The story lines draw you in and make you feel like you really know the characters. I watched all three seasons back to back.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best app ever I could play it all day because I love it so get this app
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Absolutely love it, each level gets a little more difficult and I challenge myself to get the perfect score before moving to next level
B007SGM084|5.0|Not only was book sexually erotic it has this level of romantic intimacy that anyone would want. Loved all three books and can't wait for the movie!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|We haven't been able to open it for at least a week now. I would delete and 're add but wouldn't lose everything???
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I decided to read all the trilogy before watching the first movie and I do not regret. Very catch story! I just could not stop reading until I finished the 3 books. The end of the story was a bit underrated.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|This app will allow you to print from your Kindle to an HP e-printer.  Just like other printing apps though, there are some things you just cannot print from your tablet.  This is, however, the best printing app I have tried for my Kindle HD 8.9!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I decided to read all the trilogy before watching the first movie and I do not regret. Very catch story! I just could not stop reading until I finished the 3 books. The end of the story was a bit underrated.
B0002MRPDQ|5.0|It's been a long time since I saw the movie, and my memory of the exact sequence of Marricone's music is hazy. I don't know if this is the exact sound track or a collection of the music that supports the movie.<br /><br />Does it matter? The music -- especially the main theme -- in unforgettable.<br /><br />If you liked the movie, you will love this CD. It is like much good music: a main theme echoes through many  similar passages in various guises.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I decided to read all the trilogy before watching the first movie and I do not regret. Very catch story! I just could not stop reading until I finished the 3 books. The end of the story was a bit underrated.
B005PTYP70|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law and she loved it being a big Tom Cruise fan.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is just like playing the movie, the graphics are great and the quest not too hard to rate for the whole family.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Great show. I love all the characters! Looking forward to more seasons. Everyone can relate to the perils of being an adolescent.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|As with all his books, Paulo Coelho always writes with such passion and wisdom. This book strives to answer some very important questions that many people face in life. Very inspirational.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|This film portrays a lot of the image that Lee Child puts in his books. I am an avid reader of Lee Child and his Jack Reacher series. Although Tom Cruise is not the same physical appearance that is seen in the minds eye when reading the series the ways that Jack Reacher worked in the movie does the character justice. I have read the basis of this movie and find it very close to what Lee Child wrote. In the future any more episodes a larger more frightening individual may have the avid reader of the series more willing to view them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|First one I've completed,  challenging but extremely fun and entertaining.  Great  puzzles in each level  within each level  awesome to play and kill time with  we'd more levels
B007VUCAVO|3.0|The summary page shows a &#34;plug&#34; to indicate the charge is on, but this does not show.  Ads are also suppose to go away, but I still see the small banner at the bottom of the screen.  Calibration, well, that runs forever regardless that it states the run is 90 minutes.  I gave 3 stars because I got a response within hours asking if I had removed the free version, but no other advice.  I have removed the  free version and also deleted and reloaded the pay version with no changes.  Had I actually  had to pay $2 and not points I would have rated this 2 stars.  I feel bad for anyone who had to pay $2.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I can see most of my facebook stuff with this app. At first I was happy with it then I started having trouble if I go to a link I can't get back to facebook without shutting it down.  But it is free.  I tried another similar app and it was worse so this is what I use for now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game easy to learn and it is challenging at times to get to the next level.  I would try it againy
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This series is absolutely amazing!  Recommended for anyone who even has the slightest interest in Sci Fi.  I have never watched a show that does such a good job of mixing silly, serious, heartwarming, and dramatic all together.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it seems so boring yet its so fun! I love the thrill of killing the monsters and surviving! I also love to build towns on creative! Its awesome and so worth the money!!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kepte really interested all the way through. I was a little disappointed in the end but overall a good read!
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I have always purchased games like these hoping they'll be fun and entertaining, but most of them fail :( this one I could honestly play for hours! (I have actually XD) so you should get this game. well because it's free and fun(: you'll thank me later!!!!!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Enjoyable and easy to win without being too easy. Keeps my attention and interest for quite awhile.  Good graphics and layouts.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|This movie is very sad and will be quite depressing to some people. The beginning until the part with the plane is boring but it has meaning like every scene in the whole movie. As some seen from the trailer, wolves will be playing somewhat the main role in the movie. They will be done with very good special effects, and they will be far from the wolves you see in real life. They will be very cruel. While I don't like this part because it promotes hatred towards animals and these species in general I liked the fact that humans in general will get their soft places kicked real hard. It's a good addition to today's movies. Finally it goes the other way around than what we used to see on Tv. The characters are likable. The movie falls perfectly between a good and a bad movie. It's a fine movie (3-4 stars). Since the movie is quite dark and depressing it's not surprise that in general it's rated 3 stars. The movie is really good, but I don't like depressing movies. Anyway it's a movie that I recommend but not to everyone. You might get something useful out of it, that is if you like thinking of course. Needless to say, acting was quite good!Really I can't recall anything being wrong with the movie. Last but not least, it's important that you know that it is rated ''R'' for a reason. So be ready if you're going to watch this movie!
B006BXT4TI|5.0|Love love love this album. Black keys just keep getting better and better.  The more I hear, the more I love.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|While Arnold S. is an old actor now and he isn't what he used to be, he still is a great actor. I liked the film. I think it was really entertaining. I liked the plot and actors. I liked also how many people spoke with accents. Pretty cool movie, but it's not a super-amazing movie. It's just a good action movie! Give it a try!
1451695195|4.0|If this were not written by a neurosurgeon I might have dismissed this.<br />Very detailed and believable; the recognition of those he meets make this especially thrilling.
B009MO5ES8|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, few special effects and the whole bike riding thing. I think actors were really good and I would definitely recommend this movie. I also like how it had nicely mixed action and comedy parts.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Very suspenseful and filled with great characters.  I couldn't put it down.  A friend reread it because it had been years and enjoyed all over again.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I bought this a few weeks ago looking for a new series to occupy my reading for a while.<br /><br />It's a very engaging story right from the first few pages, though Child's characters do &#34;shrug&#34; an AWEFUL lot.  :)
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Unfortunately, the writers style is not for me.  He is too detailed in his story telling.  The first 4th of the book was characters walking down stairs and up stairs - way too many pages dedicated to that scene.  The story did not pick up until 70% and then it ended abruptly.  I wanted to find out what happens next to the other silos - but I will not read from this author again.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love the changing allegiances that make you root for a character one season and wish them the worst the next.  Watching the whole season at once is the only way to keep me sane.  Now I just wished I'd waited to closer to the start of season 4.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day does it again....not thrilled with the ending but she left me excited for the next book as always.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is such a good way to take your mind from other things.  I have enjoyed this game .  But need more levels to keep you guessing. But I like it. Bring more. Penelope
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is very empowering and sad. The book was very good and I recommend it to everyone. I loved this book.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|It has multiple sounds that you can mix together to make a specific sound perfect for you.  It also drains very little of the battery on the Kindle, even when used overnight and without being plugged into the charger.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great fun that makes you think! will provide long lasting entertainment and put your clue seeking abilities to the test!
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I think that the book was great,it's a great book for people who would like to learn about other<br />Cultures.but don't bother to get big textbooks
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book.  Charlaine Harris has pretty much forgotten how to write or just doesn't care.  I guess she knew that every Sookie fan would buy the book anyway so why bother.  There is no romance, Bill and Eric are hardly in the book. I was disappointed with the last book she wrote and this one is even worse.  No satisfaction in the ending.  Ask someone for a summary and don't waste your money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|yeah on my I phone the update came on and is for &agrave;pple but not for kindle I really want realms I am going to buy it so hurry up with the update and it still doesn't work with the beta for realms
0307730700|5.0|Read the book and have referred to anyone who will listen.  This is the ultimate \\"Gut Check\\".  In a society of celebrity based on mostly the wrong reasons, the courage, character, and devotion of Adam and his family is what should be front page.  I am reminded of 2 Timothy 4:7  \\"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith\\".  God bless Adam's family, God bless the USA,and God bless all those serving our country both home and abroad.  Well Done!
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|I selected this rating because the app was easy to adapt to. I had no problems operating it to accomplish what I need it for.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is pretty cool so far. I'm on level 4 but it makes you work to get those items to get you on to the next level. Like it so far.
1476715904|3.0|I am not going to put a spoiler in this review, but if you will watch the 1965 tv show, Gidget, Season 1, Episode 17, \\"I Love You, I Love You, I Love You, I Think,\\" you will see the major plot point for Slammed, unfold before you.  I thought it was familiar but couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|The title of my review says it all. Awesome action plus defense game I love it very sexy cool units and skills
B008XG1X18|4.0|Fun to use, encyclopedias of information contained on those pages.  Navigation could be a bit simpler though.  None the less, a fun way to look at recipes, craft ideas, decor, etc.
B001XV09UG|1.0|Such good actors will not help a stupid movie with a stupid plot, stupid dialogue, stupid music. Let me make myself clear in case you haven't had your coffee yet, the movie is &#34;STUPID!!!&#34;
B001XUH69Y|4.0|Fun to see this old movie that I've always heard quotes from.  Interesting characters and a bit of history to learn from it also.
B0061US58C|4.0|It was relaxing and enjoyable to watch! Just needed a fun relaxing evening and a movie like this did it:)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The writing, acting, and filming are all excellent. But, it's the first of these that lets the rest happen. This show has true wit. So now I segue to my favorite character, Lewis Litt. Rick Hoffman is having the time of his life playing a character whose flaws, foibles, and feelings are a complex weave. I wouldn't call him a \\"bad guy\\", I'd call him an excellent ethical bastard. As proof of this watch the scene in season ones Sucker Punch in the bathroom with Harvey.
B001KPYNR0|5.0|Given the cover, you get what you expected ,a beautiful arrangement<br />of songs that soothe the soul ,year round and you won't find this<br />everywhere..
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|The performances of Hoffman and Phoenix were outstanding. One thing that bothered me was that I could not understand what Phoenix's character was saying (Phoenix was acting a speech impediment). While that might have been realistic, it was hard to understand.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great interface, user friendly with good graphics. Has a good tutorial program. Try it you will like it very much.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Only 10 levels, so far.  The rooms were challenging, but not too hard.  I can't wait for more levels' please update soon.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|They did not remake this movie.  No.  NO.  Tell me they did not remake this movie.  Please tell me.  Tell me it's not true.  Tell me that Hollywood - as terrible as it is - did not remake this stinkbomb of a movie.  I simply refuse to believe it.  No one could be that stupid. No.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Awesome awesome game! I played the second one for hours, and so far this one  isn't any different. I thought the 3rd installment wasn't that we'll put together because  of the whole wave fighting over and over, which easily gets boring. But Gameloft, made it seems, made this one very polished so far. As slot of apps are today you can play to win in this one , but I choose not to because it's looses its luster in my opinion. All in all this is a vast improvement from th  second installment, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|The game is too hard the video was a pro don't buy!<br />I played it and the controls are all wonky
B008LXZFH6|5.0|This is such a silly movie, it has so many of my favorite actors, and it’s too funny. I can’t wait to see anchorman 2 I love Will Ferrell and Steve Carell.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I love the series and am watching it for the second time now.  I am just sorry that they didn't continue with it for several more seasons.<br /><br />On another note: I am also still looking for BABYLON FIVE series. Please get it on your list.<br /><br />We are also enjoying the New Amazon Prime very much.<br /><br />Thanks, Roger Bailey
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|this movie was action packed I really expected it to be better, no such a great story line a lot lacking. not at all a bad movie I have watch much worse.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. not too easy and not too tough. I would buy this game again. I can't wait for the new levels!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|As a word game author and kindle user, I enjoy playing and trying different games on my kindle. Free Flow is nice divergence and break from working on my word game books. I Find it very mind clearing and it helps put me in a good frame of mind to work on my word game books &quot;SHakespeare Sonnet Word Games First Fooler&quot;
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I don't know how he does it, but he makes a story a work of art. Rick perfectly combined love, action, ancient myths, and humor to make this awesome series. Can't wait till the next book.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As with all of Neil Gaiman's books, I found myself devouring it too fast while trying hard to savour every word. Fantastic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you enjoyed Season 1 and Season 2, then Amazon can provide Season 3 for less than others! Great show!
B0059WTMLW|4.0|All the features and styles you need to have some fun and be able to play for a long time should you like to. well laid out menus and options and a nice variety of difficulty levels.
B0000062FL|5.0|This is to replace the wornout vinyl and cassette tapes. Perhaps the best album of all time--Abraxas is solidly wonderful throughout--simply no bad or mediocre songs. In Carlos's soaring riffs, you can hear him addressing the angels and aliens.
B00AK57N00|3.0|This game is decent as a time waster like when your waiting to do something but not as a game that you play cause it's so fun . This game starts to get repetitive after a few minutes, so if your looking for depth your not gonna find it here.
B000002KDS|5.0|Cooper has one of the best rock voices. These are good party tunes, and depending on how creepy your party is, Dead Babies will make your skin itch.
B00746O3X8|4.0|I got it a couple of days ago and I have not use it yet but the product is as described. So far I like it very much.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent show!  I love how they incorporate the lives of the staff and the family (upstairs - downstairs).  When I first starting watching, at the suggestion of my mother-in-law, I didn't think I would like it since it was a period piece; I can't believe how wrong I was.  It draws you in so you have to keep watching it to find out what happens next.  The characters, the era, and the acting are excellent, the BBC should put more shows out like this.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Amazing actors/actresses, completely incredible plot line, the make up and clothing are insane, and it's the best show I've ever seen! Five stars definitely!!
B009RH9J7W|5.0|Classy looking leather and well made.  Works well in all aspects.  It also wears well.  I enjoy the elastic strap that holds it closed.  Great price for the features.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|The beginning / intro of the movie was good/exciting but I was disappointed to find out the entire movie was about an alcoholic/drug addict. Some may have loved it but it just wasn't my kind of movie.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Fully featured and easy to use.  Passwords can get to be an annoying necessity with the rules of password creation changing from website to website.  My wife and I use many of the same websites and passwords.  LastPass makes it easy to securely manage her passwords as well as mine from my laptop.<br /><br />Software works very well on our Droids and Kindles in addition to the Toshiba laptop..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is the the best animal app I have used. Everything you could really do for a horse is in here. It is a great time burner. I really recommend getting this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|While it does have ads in the beginning but they only appear once so it is tolerable.  Games are tough with fewer winners than Microsoft solitaire, but it does provide a challenge.  I found this game to be a tremendous improvement over other &#34;free&#34; Solitaire offerings.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great book would recommend it to anyone who wants to expand their mind and realize their full potential to do great things with their life rather than coasting it and hoping for the best.
B005H29GSI|1.0|... you have to experience it for yourself.<br /><br />I suppose, in fairness, this game is probably vastly improved if played on a hardwood floor, but on a carpeted floor it becomes an exercise in frustration (due to the way the \\"wood\\" pieces are made), and on a table you're forever having to get up to retrieve parts that have been knocked off or dropped.<br /><br />Of course, that all assumes you've got a catapult that works. I suspect that's the biggest issue - if you get a \\"good\\" catapult it would be a different experience. Ours was made with all the care and attention I would expect from the very worst of Chinese factories: as others have mentioned, it \\"shoots\\" no more than a couple of inches (so much for shooting from \\"at least a foot away\\" as the instructions suggest).<br /><br />Life's too short to waste time like this, so I will be returning ours.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I'm little so I don't like the language but still GREAT game i  totally think u should get this game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game.It is so so so fun!!!My besty showed me this when the first one came out and i just loved it!!!This is my favorite game!!!&amp;)
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner was dramatic, detailed, and kept me on the edge of my seat. No boring parts, I was hooked right away! Once one thing happens, it's followed by another shocking event or revealing. I would definitely recommend it to ages 13 to 18; it's a great read for teens. The end is a great cliff hanger/ironic twist. I'm about to start the second book, The Scorch Trials. The Maze Runner is a must read!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books were like a roller coaster ride. They had me up , down and twisting for a thrill ride I never wanted to be over.
B006M3JVD6|5.0|This was a great autobiography She is a woman of great spirit I wish her and her family all  the best
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These book had it all laughing , crying and holing my breath. I became totally investing in these books that I read all or them in less than a week.<br />I really wish this writer would write another set like this these I was so sad that I was finished.
B002O2THRO|4.0|Solid action, the  screenplay so good the new version is almost a mirror image with new actors. The sets in the new version are much better, but this version is my pick of the two.
1781164266|5.0|I got this as a gift for my boyfriend for his birthday and he absolutely loves it. With every turn of each page the artwork just got better and better. Any hardcore Dead Space fan would appreciate this book.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|This should have gone straight to DVD. Compete worthless movie. Machine guns against witches. Over long. Acting poor to fair.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I love this movie. We bought it used which I highly recommend. It saves so much money and we've never had a problem.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Great car chase in Russia. Story ok. Better than a lot of the action movies this year. Do not pay more than $4 to watch.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I was nervous to buy a used DVD online but I'm glad I did. It is in great condition, no different than buying it new except we saved a lot of money. We love watching this around Christmas time together.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game but I wish it would give hints. I am not very good at puzzles. But it is different type of game.
B00BTHWFBK|1.0|This cd sucks there are no memorable songs and it pains me to say so for I'm a huge sabbath fan there is nothing here that would make me want to listen to it again buy kadavar's new cd if you want to here the cd sabbath should have made.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I am an old fan of Sherlock Holmes from my youth.  I was sceptical about how the story might survive the 21st century but in this case it did very well.  I rated it equal with the original series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this second installment of a fantastic series. I was not expecting the way it ended but that's a credit  to the author.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Cancer, death and teenagers. I gotta say that I would never have read this book if these three words were listed in the book description's first line. But, I decided to read the first page of the book which turned into the first chapter and, before I knew it, I had downloaded the book to my Kindle and was devouring the entire thing. The writing style is sometimes sarcastic and witty, but very poignant and I was sucked into the character's world and life. Many tears were shed while reading this book, but it is a must-read. In fact, I'm going to read some other books by John Green soon.
B00AG297GK|4.0|I liked it. It made me laugh. I liked the ideas in the movie as well. Good but not hilariously good.
B00400NHRO|3.0|Humor , yes.. but a bit too vulgar in places for my liking. Still a very good read. Things must have changed in internships since this book was written.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I did not like Google search. It is planned to direct you to Apps, news and purchases in which they have an interest.<br />The screen which greets you lists: Apps, News, Web, Books among others. I found that although the Apps they offer are free, they have buttons next to the play buttons which when clicked conclude a purchase. One has to be very careful or one purchases them. It would be dangerous for children to be let loose in the Apps store.<br />The news mixes relevant and irrelevant items, and includes a number of stories which have to do with Google, or are favorable to Google. It is not an unbiased site, but rather self-serving.<br />The Book icon when clicked offers books which unless one is careful, you wind up purchasing. The free books link inside is awkward to use.<br />I removed the App from my Kindle Fire HD
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Spoiler alert:  I HATE the way the last episode ends....EVERYTHING else about this show is fantastic.  You relate to the characters, the acting is superb, and Dame Maggie Smith has all the funniest lines and delivers them like a pro.  Cannot wait for next season, despite how horrid the seasons ends.  Horrid!
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read; almost like being there... almost... I recommend it to anyone interested in Vietnam...
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Does the job asked!  Works fine; I always know the time I have left on my Kindle for various tasks.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day does it again! I am borderline obsessed with these characters. Both Gideon and Eva have been through so much before finding one another and it seems like they just can't catch a break even after finally finding their soul mates in each other. eagerly waiting book 4 as the drama continues and unfolds! ...weeee!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I'm able to make out my to do list, bills owed,bills paid & shopping lists out on my kindle and not lose any sticky notes to myself on what I need to get done!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Always something to look forward to! I cant wait til season 4 comes out. Many twists and turns.. Never know what's next.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Saw it in the theater and bought the blu ray/DVD combo. I look forward to the sequel. Can't wait. The movies in this series are so much fun.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is making me pull my hair out and I love it. Great for making you really use your brains I wish it was longer
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|not my favorite season just sort of all around sad and I think the solutions are a little simple, problems dont wrap up that neatly.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A typical Grisham novel with an intricate plot and a satisfying ending. Very readable. I highly recommend it to you.
B0010T0QNQ|4.0|While I prefer the classic crocs, my job requires that if we wear them, they can't have holes. Also, I like the no-slip bottoms on these. They're very comfortable! My only issue with them is that they're a little tight at the top of the foot. Everywhere else is roomy, but right at the top of my foot it's so tight that if I wear these without socks they make an embarrassing sound when I walk. So even in the summer I have to wear socks!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love this series.  With twists and turns in every episode we can't stop watching one episode after another.  Claire Danes is fantastic!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love all the new suits and how you can upgrade them game is kind of like a temple run game but who cares its ten times better than temple run
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Most gurus and self help experts miss the mark and have you asking, &#34;did I miss something?&#34;  James doesn't, he doesn't over promise, but he delivers real steps you can take to improve your life if you want to.  Thank you James!<br /><br />Oh, and he's not charging hundreds of dollars for his advice.  You will not be disappointed in the investment. Now only if I can get my daughter to read it!
1451696191|5.0|My daughter loves this book. She has a number of her friends reading it. Highly recommend for a teenage girl!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|One iOf the best book in the series  it brings back all the other  characters  and it has a great suprise at the end. This is a great read
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game and surprisingly little lag on kindle fire but bottom two bingos when playing four cards have to hit bingo just right or multiple times costing me bingos on several occasions. Perhaps make it possible to shrink game just a tiny bit so bottom two bingos don't hang off page.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|Crichton  only started this novel. It was clearly written and finished in a manner that was nothing like the scientific Crichton we knew and loved. Really boring and shallow.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Much of the experience appears to be compatible with Buddhist thought. True truth is in the realization of beliefs, even without a belief in the power of a divinity.
067144901X|5.0|I like this  board book for it's lighthearted approach and the sturdiness of the pages. Bought it for my two year old grandson.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|An interesting view of a timeless dystopian future, of a State run amok, thinking that it has the power & right to control it's citizens anyway it chooses.  I can't wait to start Book OK.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This app is so much fun!! It is so addictive too! I play it when ever I'm bored and best of all, it's doesn't need WiFi so I could take it wherever I want!!! In fact, I'm going to play it right now!! :)
B003HI3MSE|4.0|Saw these guys in concert and their sound was consistent with the CD - always a good sign for me.  I thought the guitars and vocals were tight, recommended if you're a fan.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game keeps you guessing.  Definitely not a game for a casual gamer!  Fun and challenging, l would recommend this game to everyone.
B00C0QOZP8|4.0|Still good, and I'm a Stone Sour fan, but I'm not crazy about Part 2.  I thought Part 1 was much better myself.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a pleasure to watch at multiple levels. Great writing, acting, directing, and venue.<br />Totally addicted to it.  A must watch.
B009FOBMBI|4.0|Remains to be seen how they sound after changing lead singers, but I was surprised how good this CD is.  Shouldn't have waited so long to download it.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I liked the first season.  It has smart writing and good support characters.  But over time, the idea that the main character is a hypocrite starts to wear down the story, and makes it hard to believe.  Not so sure I would watch a 3rd season .
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a page-turner!  I did not want to put it down - very well-written and easy to read!  I will definitely buy more of his books!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A well-written mystery with fascinating plot and thought-provoking characters. It was hard to put the book down. I highly recommend it.
B00AQ2G7D6|3.0|This movie is For Steve McQueen fans. Not bad, but not great. One of the few times I thought the newer version with Pierce Brosnan was better, even though I like Steve McQueen better.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I can't tell the difference between the free version of this game and the one that costs  99 cents.  The icons look the same, the game seems to work the same also.  So why buy the 99 cent version?
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Lean In is an excellent account on several levels.  Sandberg has been fortunate to have experience in government, upper management and the Silicon Valley.<br />She maps our her mistakes and outlines a reasonable way that others can avoid similar pitfalls. And she's a good writer-story teller.  It's a must read.
B002VEEAYA|5.0|Is a great b-rate movie.  Moves right along with a good mix of suspense. Shot on location in Kauai so the views are great.
B0063M22QO|5.0|my mother showed it to me I thought it was stupid but grew to love it now I am addicted to it! LOL :P
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This movie was better than expected. The storyline had good depth and action sequences. Would definitely recommend this movie to friends.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game to play have to figure out puzzles and find objects some are hard to find in the game
B001NA6096|3.0|3/4 boring fluff, picks up a little steam till the final 30 minutes or son.  Strictly rent, don't buy a ticket.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|It is a good mixture of spiritual and materialistic insights, a jolt of fresh air for a person stuck in their current situation before a new leap of faith into their next self.<br /><br />This book is exactly after my own heart. Thank you, James!
B005IQZB14|5.0|What an inspiring story about love, loss and letting go. Life is surely an adventure and Cheryl Strayed has reminded me of how all the uphill climbs and daring descents we have faced and will face are all things to be thankful for. Reading this was a needed spiritual journey for me.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Keeps the great story line going. Enjoyed this addition and waiting for the next book in the series to come out!
B007N8RULO|4.0|This is fun to play. You are always trying to do better than your time before.<br />You can still move at your own pace.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good but needs more than 10 levels. Not too hard to be frustrating but not too easy to be boring.
B0026QC0TA|1.0|Was watching and enjoying it paused with notice of &#34;loading&#34;.  The download kept dropping down until it was near zero.  Gave up, went over to Netflix, found the movie and was able to pick it up where it had left off on Amazon, and played through fine with no interruption.  Great movie, really enjoyed it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|She is quite a role model! Doesn't every mother dream to be like her? The cast is good and the dialogues pleasant. A nice series.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Loved the book and story and cannot wait until the final book comes out.  Very good wordage, great story telling...
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This entire movie was a Tim Burton-style (yes, that's a bad thing!) showcase for special effects.  What we get is a barrage of color-popping highly dynamic scenes with little bits of plot thrown in to get us to the next effects-laden high-speed chase/swim/float/baloon ride/fall through the admittedly lush, pretty and color-laden landscape.  But below the shiny veneer is... nothing.  And maybe the entire film was a meditation on and symbol for the nature of the Land of Oz itself:  much as (in the original) the Wizard behind the curtain ins't really there (or at least, he isn't a wizard), the same can be said about this film.  To quote Gertrude Stein:  there's no \\"there\\" there.  Pull away the color overlay and you've got decay.<br /><br />I expected more from Sam Raimi, though I'm not sure why; since Spiderman (the first), everything he's done has been pretty craptacular (\\"Drag Me To Hell\\" being the notable exception), and this was no different.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|...the main story (chasing and finding out more about who killed the main characters parents) is not much talked about.  I am sure it will all come together in the next book, but, I believe it was a little too winded (1000 pages).  Great writing and I enjoyed the book, but that is the main issue with the book.  I would recommend it anyway.
0439023483|5.0|This is a fabulous book.  I have read it at least 4 times and have watched the movie 3 times.  Suzanne Collins is a great author and this book is a great start to the series.  Love it!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Ok, Tangled is a little different than what I am used to reading since it was done from a mans perspective. It was perfect! Emma is a man trapped in a womans body. She was able to portray Drew exactly the way I envisioned him.<br />Drew was funny, sexy, stubborn and amazing! Great book with minimum angst.
1423101472|5.0|Rick Riordan writes amazing books and this is one of them.  Be sure to read the entire series.  My grandson and I read all of Rick's books and discuss them.  It is a fun activity and I highly recommend these books.
B00CZF87TY|5.0|This is a great, enjoyable soundtrack; it accompanies the movie perfectly! The Minions are, without question, one of the best parts of this soundtrack --tracks 2 (\\"Another Irish Drinking Song\\"), 5 (\\"I Swear\\"), 6 (\\"Y.M.C.A\\"), and 24 (\\"Ba Do Bleep\\") are just really fun to listen to. Hearing track 10 (\\"The Fairy Party\\"), I was reminded again of how this movie combines humor, compassion, and selflessness to make a wonderful movie.
1419705849|5.0|This book stays true to the other Diary of a Wimpy Kid books.  The boys in my struggling reader class enjoy all of these and will pick one of these books up for independent reading when time allows.
B00DHNBY02|5.0|Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell have out done themselves with this remake.  An excellent addition to any horror collection.  I highly recommend it.
1423113381|5.0|This is definitely the best book in the Kan Chronicles Series and was thoroughly enjoyed by my grandson and myself.  Also, students in my class at middle school rave about it.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This is a great product for making any kind of mathmatical conversion or calculation. I also use it daily to look up food nutrition and it is faster and more accurate than using books. Just type or speak the food and the amount and it gives the complete breakdown of calories, carbs, fat etc. This is a great product !
0545265355|5.0|My entire family has read this series and loved it.  We all own a copy of the books and the first movie.  We are awaiting the production of &#34;Catching Fire&#34; that should be out in the Fall of 2014.
B00AGDW8II|4.0|This thriller makes me wonder how easy it is to murder. Good cast, and interesting locations. A favorite of mine.
1423101499|5.0|Great series and a good book.  Rick Riordan is a fabulous author and my grandsons and I read all of his books, then discuss and move to the next one.
B00DJXSKWU|5.0|Lots of structures, weapons, and armor, tons of upgrades for your units. Overall simple and fun. Get this game AIs are intelligent as well and a challenge.
0679809015|3.0|Gave this as a gift and have not heard if it is liked or not.  If it was GREAT, I am sure I would have heard so maybe not a good investment.
0439023491|5.0|My wife loves it.  She read this is a couple days and was on to the next book.  I'm waiting for the movie. xP
1423140605|4.0|All of Riordan's books are good.  We started with the 39 Clues and are now reading this series.  If the books were published closer together, it would help with the continuity of the story but they are all good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never read and Amazon Self Published book before, I decided to give it try with WOOL. Why not? The book has amazing reviews and fitted perfectly on the type I was looking for, dystopian science fiction, thriller, etc.<br /><br />The truth is that his book is simply AMAZING, you loose yourself completely since the first chapter. I wondered if I should buy only the first part but the whole compilation was so much worth it. I think what makes it so addicting and unpredictable is that it hasn't been on the hands of a professional editor, that pushed the book to be something it wasn't meant before. The unexpected plots and twists, the different writing order, the time changes, startle you over and over again, and,  without realizing, you find yourself reading in every possible part of your day.<br /><br />I dont want to spoil any surprises, so, if you like science fiction, apocalyptic fiction or psychological thrillers this is the book you have been looking for.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for providing the platform for this great masterpieces to arrive to us, and thank you Hugh Howey for taking the chance of writing it.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like the free version of this clock so I decided to buy it. I like this  u can set the music and the sleep feature. Kinda wish that th  music would stay on when I closet cover on it. Over all great clock! :)
B005EVVESM|2.0|I purchased this CD because \\"Moves like Jaggar\\" was supposed to be \\"featured\\" on it.  It was NOT. I am very disappointed not only with Amazon but with A&M/Octane Records of NYC.  I will think twice about making future purchases through Amazon.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Storyline keeping me interested enough to look forward to season 4.  A little slow at times, but just when I started to glaze over, it picks up.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Running Barry through the course, jumping and flying his jetpack to collect tokens is my 9 year old granddaughter's funnest game!!!
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Video quality was great. No problems with download speed. Stream was flawless. Can't go wrong with any season of SG-1
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I just love this show. I can't believe that there is only one more season. I don't know what I'm going to do after it ends.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Maybe I'm just dense, but I am stuck on a beginning level, and I am going to uninstall it. Four days trying to get past one level, I give up.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|I really liked this movie, it was a whole lot better than I thought it would be. I thought it was going to be just as bad as Twilight but I was mistaken. You should really give this movie a chance.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game is super addicting and you are still able to do lots of stuff without having to pay real money or wait long time for stuff
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The twists and turns never stop. I am hooked. Cant wait for season four. My only complaint is that the episodes are a little shorter than season 2.
B00BSBXA98|3.0|It seems to me that they could have done a better job with making a story line.  It was very thin, more like a ballet than a movie.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|A great replacement for my built-in flash (Nikon D40) that no longer works. Easy to use, automatic, etc. Definitely would recommend.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The plots and characters continue to be strong! Always the right twist of social justice! Love the emotion and tight shots of actor's face during stressful moments. Great TV drama!
B00846F1YW|3.0|A fun little game.  A great way to relax your body.  Game is divided into little sections so playing at appointments  is good
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love the feminist subplots! Also love the risks the writers take at showing people as real, vulnerable and even not so nice from time to time. The the sexual tension between Kalinda and everyone continues to be steamy. And kudos for maintaining the Will and Alicia tension and angst! So great to see such strong female characters! I want to grow up to be Diane Lockhart, lol!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book really makes you think about how your actions and words can affect others. A truthful and painful story with a powerful message
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice because you can modify certain aspects of the game.  Never had any bugs or glitches. If you stop in the middle of a game,you can pick up when you return.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|How can anyone not like this new singer? He somehow manages to bring the band back to its roots, while at the same time elevating the music to a new level!<br /><br />This CD has been in my car player on repeat ever since I received it! Every song is excellent! I highly recommended!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|The game is very fun but it keeps crashing! When ever i want to play it, i usually &quot;click or push&quot; the icon, the screen goes black, and goes to home screen! Please Fix...
B004ZNB12O|5.0|This CD has some wonderful music by Pink Floyd.  I don't care for the Wall, as I kept changing the lyrics to &#34; kids leave those teachers alone&#34;.  28 years of teaching could be why.  Best line, &#34; By the way, which one's Pink?&#34;
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I bought this to use as a reference in the recording studio, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  The songs have a cool retro feel, and there are actually real melodies in some of the songs.
B004ZY0VHY|2.0|This author spends way to much time reflecting on what she thought and  did in the past. No one could remember to the degree that she claims to do. I read one-forth of this book and had to quit. I kept telling myself she would get the important lesson she is writing about, but she didn`t so I gave it up.

B00AR83PN4|2.0|If you had forgotten why having \\"trial\\" software was a good idea, this app will remind you why you want to try something out before buying it.  It's been a while since I deleted a freebie within 10 minutes of installing, and this bad boy lasted just over five.  Despite the only permission is the network permission for the leaderboards (which don't seem to work), and the only ad is for its previous FAOTD Cubistry (a much better game), I couldn't give this a good review.<br /><br />The game is built on Unity.  Some of the most beautiful games in the appstore are created using Unity.  Here, the opportunity isn't merely squandered, it is as if the developer took it as a challenge to create the ugliest, most garish possible game out of it.  The graphics and sound emulate what you'd find in the Atari 2600 era.<br /><br />The text and numbers are in that \\"space\\" font so popular during the first Disco era.  To make matters worse, the text is almost intentionally camouflaged in the background, making it difficult to discern what's there.  Men have a more difficult time with colors than women.  Fortunately, my color vision has always been near the top of the scale, but I can see an entire population, especially an aging population, that is just going to be frustrated and unhappy with the fonts and color choices.  The color of the blocks can be an issue; for example the orangy yellow and the shiny yellow are NOT the same color.  Why not a true orange?  Doesn't make sense.  The developer certainly chose to ignore color blindness, and after five minutes with this app I almost envied that condition!<br /><br />The game play is simple enough, though there is not enough information, documentation, or tutorial to cover the surface area of a postage stamp, and what is there is confusing and not accessible once the game starts.  So maybe this will help you before you start playing:<br />The blue arrows at the bottom right spin the platform left or right.  The swap button makes the falling column flip.  The drop button drops the blocks, like in Tetris.  You can use your finger to help place the falling blocks where you want on the platform.<br /><br />The problem is both the spinning of the platform - the arrows just don't move it fast enough and are inconvenient - and the placement system, which is really, royally screwed up.  When the blocks start getting more complex, the app has a hard time telling where you want the block, and frequently places it where you don't want it.  Granted, the controls are not as problematic as the Zen3 game, but the other issues make it undesirable to play.<br /><br />Cubimania got a second star because it doesn't have any permissions other than the network permission.  Other than that, it really isn't worth having even for free.ling column flip.  The drop button drops the blocks, like in Tetris.

B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|If you are not ready for innovations, do not buy it.<br />If you stubbornly believe that all great classics should be performed in a particular way, still do not buy it.<br />If you are a granular purist fixated on details instead of a big picture, all the more so, do not buy it.<br /><br />However, if you are neither of the above, this is your recording.<br /><br />It overhauls everything in Norma  - mezzo replaces soprano, soprano becomes mezzo; period instruments replace modern, modern tempos replace periods'; recent updates replaces the traditional score, the traditional score is upgraded. The standard cover picture of suffering women with deep sorrow on their faces displays now a Harley Davidson biker, etc.<br />Singing is also remarkably different on all fronts. Norma is coloratura mezzo with a strong deep-chest vibrato, Pollione is a light and vary humane tenor with excellent pitch and phrasing. The rest of the cast is equally impressive. Conducting is violent, powerful and focused. The orchestra responds with fire and devotion. Decca's sound is absolutely first class, very upfront and submerging listeners directly into the abyss of music. Any comparisons with the great singers of the past are meaningless, as this Norma is fundamentally different.<br /><br />To sum, this recording is strongly recommended for all open-minded music lovers.
159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver is one of the most famous statistician, thanks to his blog FiveThirtyEight, among others. He correctly predicted detailed US elections in 2012. Nate recently wrote a book about prediction, very well summarized by the subtitle: why so many predictions fail - but some don't. The book is a journey in the world of statistical prediction through topics such as earthquake, weather, politics, chess and poker among others.<br /><br />The books gives both examples of prediction successes and failures. As Nate writes, in the age of Big Data: \\"[...] even if the amount of knowledge in the world is increasing, the gap between what we know and what we think we know may be widening\\". The only critic I can make on the book is one from a European reader. The books starts with heavy chapters on US politics and baseball. We need to persist a hundred pages before reading about non-US related topics. Also, most of the text focus on domain description rather than statistical explanations (which is in fact normal for a statistician author).<br /><br />The book contains excellent advices for data miners, for example about the importance of communicating about uncertainty. Nate also warns against the effect of predictions: \\"In many cases involving predictions about human activity, the very act of prediction can alter the way that people behave\\". The often read topic about correlation/causation is of course discussed. To conclude, Nate's book is a journey in the real-world of statistical predictions. Although (or because) the book covers complex subjects in details, it is worth reading it!

B001B3MCQK|5.0|This was his first album and what an album!  The guy is a master poet who can wrap his words wonderfully to the music arrangements.  The style is very much 70's and has an edge to it.  The songs are very powerful and can still apply to the troubles in  current societies.  I downloaded it three days ago and cannot stop listening to it.  Every time I listen to it, I hear something new.  The guy is great and so glad he is getting the recognition he deserved.  This is a must have for any music collection.  Also, be sure to check out Coming From Reality.  The songs are a bit more developed along with a couple of wonderful ballads!
B00B5P37IG|1.0|This is a waste of my coins.  So disappointed.  There are no good channels to speak of.  AND its not Live.  News channels and religious channels. Thats about the sum of it.  Nothing against either.  Just a misleading app. that's all

B001NLKZUA|4.0|I am pleased to announce that I have been thoroughly sucked into another franchise, this time a knowing, self-aware and enormously entertaining one known as \\"The Mortal Instruments.\\"  City of Ashes is the second book in the series, and like its predecessor (City of Bones) it simultaneously embraces every single cliche in every fantasy novel ever written (with visible tropes from JK Rowling, Philip Pullman, Anne Rice, Bram Stoker, Jonathan Stroud, Neil Gaiman, George Lucas, Orson Scott Card, JRR Tolkien, the Twilight books, V.C. Andrews, and so many more I can't even begin to list them all) and mocks them.  Cassandra Clare never takes herself too seriously (which would have doomed the entire enterprise) but instead focuses on entertaining us with a fun story while manipulating archetypes in the background so that we can also appreciate the Easter egg hunt for in-jokes.  Our heroine Clary (and her \\"brother\\" Jace and putative boyfriend Simon) are once again facing the war between angelic demon hunters and a fallen leader who seeks power and revenge, while showing us the underworld of magical New York City.  This is not \\"original\\" (you will not find the deeper resonance of the best YA or fantasy fiction here) but it is instead a wild, cackling embrace of everything derivative, with witty dialogue to match.  Already started on book 3...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show its the best on tv. I would like to see more great shows, finally something good to watch!

1401235425|5.0|The New 52 reboots Batman as the capable Caped Crusader but this time around he has some blind spots in thinking he knows everything there is to know about Gotham City.<br /><br />Enter the urban legend of the Court of Owls. Batman doesn't believe they exist (because he couldn't find any indication of them when he was an investigator boy so talk about a blind spot) and ignores the talk until the urban legend begins to reveal itself as it targets Batman.<br /><br />\\"Beware the Court of Owls, that watches all the time, ruling Gotham from a shadowed perch, behind granite and lime. They watch you at your hearth, they watch you in your bed, speak not a whispered word about them, or they'll send The Talon for your head.\\"<br /><br />Batman's hubris puts him into a bad spot which leads to a torturous and extended arena  scenario in which he discovers he has underestimated the urban legend. Purists of the old Batman may take issue with this outcome.<br /><br />Artwork was excellent not just because of how it was drawn but the choice of presentation, especially when a whole page would divide up man panels and then one page would have only one incredibly large panel with great impact. I especially liked when a few pages at the end were upside down on purpose.<br /><br />A script of the pages 21-24 is in the back.<br /><br />Spoiler info below.<br /><br />ARTWORK PRESENTATION: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus; ACTION SCENES: A minus; BATMAN MYTHOLOGY/FOCUSES: B plus; CLUE TRAIL: B plus; WHEN READ: end of May to early June 2013; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus<br /><br />SPOILERS: it's interesting that the tale opened with Batman taking on several known villains as if they were physical imbeciles and perhaps implied that Batman has them figured out but not so much the Court of Owls.<br /><br />Nice touch when the DNA of a murderer is Dick Grayson and you find out it's one of his ancestors.<br /><br />The madness maze and gladiatorial duel were nicely done (arguably my favorite part). Urban tales linking one of Wayne's ancestors to the Court of Owls makes it more personal.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun and exciting game for me and my family to play wherever I am I will always play this game most of the time I play it in the car it is just so fun
0446580848|4.0|MINI REVIEW: Corey is back. Maybe not better than ever but if you're a fan like myself then it's fun to revisit with the character. This time around he and his wife are being used as bait to catch a terrorist leader nicknamed \\"The Panther\\" in the Middle East (Sana'a, Yemen which is one of the most dangerous spots for Americans). Corey is his usual wisecracking and musing self but he does it so much at the expense of the plotting that you sometimes realize 50 pages have passed and you're still in the same spot. It's a good thing the book is long and arguably it would have been a better plotted book if it had trimmed off about 200 pages. That said, if you love hanging out with Corey you'll be more forgiving of such meanderings. Action (when it's there) is good to very good and the setting is excellent. Tension was slack for me because of the meanderings but I am far from giving up on John Corey so don't worry. OVERALL GRADE ON THE SHANNON SCALE: B (less if you got irritated with Corey but then why have you read so far in the series then?).
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game a lot and the armor is amazing and this game is like temple run but better<br />woo woo woo you know it
B000CNESU8|5.0|I can't figure if the screenwriter, the amazing Paddy C., is smiling from beyond or spinning in his final rest.  This nightmarish vision of television, which was (to the public eye) truly fiction at the time the film was made, has come way too close to full-on reality today.  Great performances and at least one truly iconic scene in this film.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I really loved it and I'm not a fan of rap at all so I was really happy I enjoyed it.
B00004XPPE|5.0|One of the truly great films, told in a dead-pan almost documentary style.  Exceptional cast.  Fine DVD transfer.  A real time capsule.  Folks today forget sometimes about the Cold War and its calculations - and risk of miscalculations.  Pair watching this film with DR. STRANGELOVE, from the same year.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This is kind of a short story. Interesting enough. It won't change your life, but I don't think that was intended.
B00136S11U|5.0|Whether you like blues and have never heard Keb' Mo' play before, or you're one of his biggest fans...you will definitely find this to be a wonderful addition to you library.

0345803485|5.0|I thought this was a very good book. I thought it more romantic. and about what two consenting adults do with their sex life. I cant wait to read the other 2 books
B00AMEZDPG|5.0|There is only one original Romeo and Juliet and this is it! No other remake of this does it justice.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Love the show and glad it is on Amazon Prime for FREE!!!  That makes it even more fun to watch!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love reading about this era and did not want to put it down.  I liked the perspective of the white indentured servant and how that even after granted freedom it is hard to fit in either social status.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app makes you think in chronicle order forcing you to use common sense. A great mind game that deserves 5 stars! :)
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Their words:  I like the cool things the new birds can do but do not like that they cannot do what the old birds could do.

0756686970|5.0|My 8 year old daughter purchased this and LOVES it.  She loves sharing this interest with her daddy! It keeps her reading!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. Con only 10 levels. Can not wait until more levels are released. Hopefully sooner rather than later.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am a fan of Khaled Hosseini and pre-ordered this for my Kindle as soon as I saw it was coming out.  He does not disappoint if you like is other 2 books &#34;Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; .
B0080BFVPU|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies and now I'm excited to have it on Blu-ray. John Cusack is adorable especially when he sits with the little boy. I watch it over and over.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Never knew about the Orphan Train and found the book interesting as a novel based on an actual event in history.  I did have trouble attaching to the young girl in foster care, but it did not derail me much rom the story.  I then read &#34;Orphan Train Rider: One Boy's True Story&#34;  to learn more facts about the Orphan Train and was please with the as well.
B003L77GRO|2.0|I purchased Season 5 and discovered that viewers are forced to watch Showtime promos every time the DVD is played. It isn't possible to fast-forward through the promos.  Each time the fast-forward button is pressed, the viewer is punished with another replay of the promos. For the first six episodes, the high suspense cat and mouse games vanished; replaced with predictable, no-suspense scenarios; insipid dialog, flat performances. The pace does pick up half-way through the season; but not enough to make it comparable to seasons 1-4.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Game is good, and you can change the level of difficulty.  Nice thing to do before going to bed.  Ran out of puzzles rather quickly though.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Love the show and really enjoyed watching first season. Getting to know the characters from onset has been enjoyable. Video selection from Amazon.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie and I have to say that it was one of Tom's best in my eyes. Highly recommend this film.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Really worth getting this app.  Lots of choices of play and although repetitive the game has skill and is quick and satisfying.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Now, this is a AS movie that warrants everyon'e attention. He is back in this movie and I enjoyed the H____ out of it! Go Arnold!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is one of my wife's and mine favorite shows.  We make sure we never miss an episode.  It's very entertaining with alot of twists and turns.  With a light hearted humor from time to time as well!  Don't miss it!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|THE MOVIE WAS REALLY GOOD. I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD BE. GOOD STORY AND GREAT ACTION. WAY TO GO HANSEL AND GRETEL.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|the game is pretty fun. it gets the mind working. i wish that there were more levels to play though
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read it at least 5 times now! So so good! All the copycats out there can't compete. This is the best!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A pretty good story but I found the end lacking. Probably because I thought this was the last book. I look forward to the next one.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is amazing.  The puzzles are challenging but not so much that you can't figure it out on your own and even if you do need a hint or two, the ones that they give you just point you in the right direction, not give you the answer outright.i definitely like this game! Can't wait till the next.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Couldn't` put it down. The characters seem like kids everyone knows. Five stars all the way! I can't wait to start  \\"City of Ashes\\".
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Beautiful and Hypnotic!<br /><br />Playing around with the settings allows you to create some very beautiful designs. Still having fun exploring it, but so far.. 5 Stars :)
B00BKTFABE|3.0|It is not clear where the pictures go for storage. Sometimes they go to one place, then other times to another place.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|Similar to a lot of android puzzle games. What's there is well executed and generally fun to play.  The cute animations are a nice addition to dress up the game.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Just like on my phone except easier to see because of the kindle being larger. Would recommend this to others.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Sorry, I really can't rate this product because I never got it on my HD Fire.  I'm new<br />to Apps and it could be me.  The weather app I downloaded has never pulled up my location.  I didn't make a big deal out of it because they are free and I wanted to try<br />free ones until I was comfortable using them.<br />Jim<br /><br />Most of what I see in these apps are games
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book is now on my list of favorite books, ever. I love the writing, it reads like a memoir to the point you have to remind yourself that this didn't actually happen (or at least I would hope not). The twists and turns of the book make it impossible to put down and the ending had me in tears.<br />I read this book for book club and look forward to the discussion. I highly recommend it!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|nice. keeps my cpu cool at 20c does its job I highly recommend this to any one who dosent wanna spend too much on a cpu cooler
B002WBTRBI|5.0|Gene Hackman has moments where his role is just astounding.<br />Like when he calls Bones, from his office.<br />The entire cast is superb.  And, of course, James Gandolfini<br />is also brilliant-as was usual for him.
1423113454|5.0|The book was realistic enough to be very entertaining without being completely implausible. The ancient Egyptian mythology was very interesting and kept me captivated. If you enjoy fantasy novels and have an active imagination, then you will love this book.
B001JI72AI|5.0|Great movie for young and old alike. With blu ray I can see things didn't notice before, like a river bed on the moon? Is that from a real photo? Is it a lava flow? Check it out.
B00CHILW64|5.0|It was and fantastic movie...hard to believe its a true story!! I would give this your top rating!<br /> a must see!
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|In my last review I had said I didn't like it. That was only on a first listen. Well I let it grow on my over the past few days. I love it now. The only 2 songs I don't like are Juliet and Scream and Be Free. Other than that overall good album! If you don't like it at first keep on listening to it.
1419705849|5.0|Our kid loves all these books. It's good to have things that keep them interested in reading and something other than t.v.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Perfect! The final battle. I almost screamed from the suspense. I also cried because these characters are like my own family. Love this series and I'm hungry for more
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The book Feast for Crows and Dance of Dragons was originally suppose to be one book so the author wrote so much it had to be split in two. This made it a little awkward but the story was still great.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Great action-packed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat for all 2 hours; don't cringe when the &#34;classics&#34; get mashed either cause they &#34;go&#34; for a good cause!!
3836501899|4.0|Full of naked people so people with kids beware. It's somewhat artsy.. but I think it could have been better...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and yet hard CAN also frustrate you. Can't wait for more levels to come so I can play again
0810993139|5.0|Our kid loves all these books. It's good to have things that keep them interested in reading and something other than t.v.

1419702238|5.0|Our kid loves all these books. It's good to have things that keep them interested in reading and something other than t.v.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was skeptical about this game initially, but because it was free I gave it a shot. It totally exceeded my expectations! I was disappointed at the lack of rooms, but there should be new ones soon.
0792165020|4.0|This movie was based on the first of five novels (`the Ripliad'!) written about the (fortunately fictional) psychopath Tom Ripley by Patricia Highsmith. Like the movie of her first novel, Strangers on a Train, it probes the psychology of her characters. Ripley (Matt Damon) is a talented piano player who earns money as a con-man. He is asked by shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) to go to Italy to persuade his wastrel playboy son Dickie (Jude Law) to come home. Actually, Ripley soon finds he enjoys the life-style too much, especially the company of Dickie's girl-friend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), and joins in with Dickie's activities. The smooth flowing of his new persona is disrupted by his meeting with a real heiress at the airport, Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett), and a real friend of Dickie's from Princeton, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman). To Meredith, Ripley has already passed himself off as Dickie Greenleaf. Then a local girl that Dickie has made pregnant drowns herself. For the rest of the movie Damon has sometimes to be `Dickie Greenleaf' for Meredith and others, and at other times himself, Tom Ripley, for Marge and Dickie. Eventually Ripley and Dickie fall out and Dickie is killed: Ripley tells Marge that he has simply gone off to other parts of Italy, but Marge never really believes him. This is an intriguing characterful thriller and, though long, is really entertaining. The director was Anthony Minghella.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|My granddaughter loves it. she's into dress up with her mom's clothes and make up so this gives her a creative mind
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This book may be geared towards younger readers, much like Hunger Games, but 'tweens, teens and adults will love this trilogy. Action, heartbreak and love are entangled in this story. A must read!
B0010T56J0|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Shine. Geoffrey Rush portrayed the main character David, quite nicely. David who developed traits of a psychological disorder was an astaunishing piano player... It was very nicely done.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Dumb game.  I can't see why it became so popular.  Parents, teach your children to tie their shoelaces instead of playing this game.  You will give them a better life skill.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|The entire series could be good if it did not intoduce so many characters OR if they put the list of characters at the beginning of the book so you have ready reference.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Blondie greatest hits pretty much sums it up. Songs I know and recognize but did not know the artist until now.
B000FC130E|5.0|Very interesting and imaginative. Good character development and a satisfying ending. I will be looking at other Neil Gaiman books
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Get summer movie by J.J Abrams filmed in Weirton, WV mostly. Film about friends and their movie they are filming on (you guessed it) Super 8 millimeter film.
B009X01C64|4.0|I had some real heartburn about spending this much money for a case/cover for my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;, but I begrudgingly ordered it anyway because of the swivel feature. The unit is solidly made and holds the tablet securely. The swivel feature has been very good, so my heartburn has subsided..for now.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|This game is great for styling hair however you want it. So the people that have always wanted to shave someone's head, this is YOUR kind of game. But it's great. You can change the color of hair, and, there are NO goals! It's freestyle! But I would have given the app/game 5 stars if you didn't have to buy certain hair colors and models. It gives you 2 models to choose from: a little girl with orange-ish hair, and a adult with purple-ish hair. But there are 2 other people. But you have to buy them for $3.99 EACH!!!! Now THAT'S ridiculous pricing!!! But overall, if you like cutting hair, THIS is YOUR game!<br />  Thanks for reading my review.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|My son is a big fan of the old French Tin Tin cartoons, so he was very excited to watch this. I reluctantly sat down to see it with him, and it took a solid 3 seconds for me to be impressed. We had a blast! Fantastic computer animation - the best I've seen yet. Great adventure, and very close to the original story lines, or so my son told me. A bit on the violent side for the younger set, but for older kids (and adults) it was fun from beginning to end.
B002M87V0A|5.0|THIS MUSICAL WAS GREAT. I LIKE THE WAY THAT THIS MUSICAL CHANGED A MAN FROM BEING GREEDED TO BEING GREAT. IT ALSO HELP THE LIBRARIAN BECOME SOMETHING MORE THAN A COLD FISH. SHE BECAME HAPPY AND WONDERFUL TO BE WITH. I ALSO LIKED SEENING THE LITTLE BOY OVER COMING HIS TO BEING SHY OF SPEAKING. WONDERFUL MOVIE FOR A FAMILY TO SEE. A MUST FOR CHILDREN SO THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT OTHER CHILDREN TOO. HAVE A BOWL OF POPCORN TOO.
B003UESJFG|5.0|Love the movie and the voice actors. This is great for family and friends of all ages to watch and enjoy.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|The spelling mistakes I made before were crazy. The set up however was disappoints me . I would rather pick my letter that I'm looking for. I mite as well us dictionary.com. I don't always have Internet however. Make the changes and I will continue to use it.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Great for re routing around traffic! Saved us a ton of time on our recent vacation.  Fun for passenger to keep up with notifications.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|The movie is really pretty good. Fun and entertaining although not a classic, it is enjoyable. Even the kids like it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. I laughed and I cried. Hopeless was an emotional roller coaster. My heart breaks for the things Sky went through and Holder made me melt with his raw passion to make things better. Definitely a story that stays with you long after the last page.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I relly enjoy this movie. The plot is a little thin but it always is in these kind of movies. Lots of action, very funny (Puny god ROFL) and good performances by the cast. Enjoyable with freinds and family.
B00DD49R0E|2.0|I was really disappointed with this movie. I thought it was a plot like the first one. Not a lot happens, you really don't get anywhere, and the movie mostly focuses on the minions. Which was fine, if it had more of a plot. I also thought the purple minion were kind of scary for little children. They are in-destructible restores that will eat anything, including people. No one gets eaten, but purple minions with large teeth chasing little kids cuz they want to eat them will set some little kids off. It was cute and had some laughs, but nothing that really gets your interest.
B005DD7H50|4.0|I have no trouble connecting the plot (which I don't wish to give spoilers!) to the many nuances that led up to it and solidly recall the actors, they were good. The film was done admirably both in light and sound and it's got &#34;the best story around&#34; going for it in a way the twists fit.
B008JFUO36|2.0|In the previews, the movie looked very interesting. Of course they always do, but when you see the movie...it's not what you expect. The movie was awfully boring and there wasn't a lot of action. I was confused a lot and had to keep up with all the different copies of Tom cruise. The ending was ridiculous and not very thought provoked. There was so much more they could do with this movie. It was very long and very boring, and I was happy when it ended. I only give it two stars cuz even though e movie was boring, the storyline was a little interesting, but like I said, the director could do so much more.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|An enlightening tale of a death of a young girl and the effects on her family! A masterpiece of intertwining stories that lead to one thing: letting go.
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|This movie was ok. I thought the movie had more will smith in it, and he actually went out in the jungle with his son. That is not the case since will smiths legs are broke and he's stuck in the crashed ship. The movie is all about fear and how to face it, which I enjoyed. There wasn't a lot of action, but enough to keep you into it. I did also enjoy that will smiths son was in it and it was one of those father son bonding times. This more of a movie that you would see once and it will be enough.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This a game that you can spend hours on and never really get tired of playing.  It is a very interesting game.
B0067EKYS6|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It had a lot of symbolism and the visual effect was excellent. I didn't enjoy Leo saying old sport every other sentence, but I have read the book and he does it say it a few times in the book too, so it wasn't that bad. I thought it followed the book pretty well, there were some missing parts but they weren't that important and they also added some extra scenes that the book that didn't have and it did not screw up the movie at all. It was a really enjoyable film, but a fair warning, nothing with action happens. It's a drama romance, with a twist if you haven't read the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun app that is challenging without being frustrating.  Great game for couples to do together.  Can`t beat the price!  Recommend you get it.
B008JFUMDS|5.0|This was an excellent movie. It was well thought out and the characters sucked you in. I was always guessing what the magicians next ploy will be to steal money and they do it well thought out ways. This is a movie I would spend 9 dollars to see again and even buy it. There is a pretty big twist in the end, that makes you keep guessing through the whole movie. The dialogue was superb and the acting meets your expectations. This is a movie I would deffiently recommend to anyone who loves magicians and trickery.
B000NMW6M0|2.0|This movie has a great cast who seemed genuinely concerned about getting their message across. The environment was overly central. Too many scenes seemed featured for the message \\"hot, dry, dirty.\\"
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game is okay. I think it take much in coins to clear new areas and when not buying coins it take a while to collect enough of them. Can only gift very small amount of friends each day.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not too difficult, not too easy. makes you think and use logic plus memory. hope you put more levels on this soon.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very nice app. Simple,reliable,interesting design. I like how it's changing colours as it is discharging. I like it because it is not only showing how much battery is left but also how much music you can listen to or how much browsing you can do, etc. On my Kindle Fire HD it works perfectly and looks great!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album i've been looking for it every where I tried all Wal-Marts and nothing . I've been wanting this CD for a Very LONG time im happy I got it for a very good price and very great time it took to come in.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love all of them. I can't wait for the 3rd season to start! And yes I would recommend this to all my friends and family!
B005723JSQ|5.0|Fun and refreshing read! I found myself getting attached to the characters and didn't want the book to end! First time I read Kinsella but will definitely read her again.
B004UPANGM|5.0|Not as scary as the first film with more of an attitude of humor that really made the Evil Dead series into a cult film series. This was my favorite in the series for years, but over time I have shifted to Army of Darkness as my top choice. Either way, you can't go wrong with Bruce Campbell. He enhances every project he is party to, whether Ash or Bubba Ho-Tep, or as a caricature of himself. Even Oz the Great and Powerful was better because of him, orange and unrecognizable as he was.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was pretty challenging but I wish it was longer.  I love games like this.  I would give it five stars if there were more chapters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so worth getting.Best game ever.Everybody should own it.The around the world part was a really good idea.It is hilarious because the police officer is so big and his legs are so skinny.
B006QSLBC6|5.0|My grandson, sixteen, have seen this twice. We love it. To some it might seem a bit slow, to us it just unfolds.<br />Jack Black is wonderful.
B002SJ8FH6|5.0|This film shows that Hitchcock could take a terrible book and make it into a great movie experience. It is in my top 10 and I have watched it at least 100 times. While  the stars - Madeleine Carroll and Robert Donat - are wonderful, it is the actors with the small parts that I enjoy the most. Peggy Ashcroft is amazing as the crofter's wife, but, of course, she is probably the best actor in the film.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wow this season was great, cannot wait for season 4!<br />Starting to like O'brian, she is not as evil as she appears!
B004LROUNG|5.0|I bought this to read on the plane and didn't want to arrive at my destination.  I would highly recommend it .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a page-turner of games. Each level has a different way of linking clues, and it's hard to put it down! A brilliant boredom-buster.
B003B02O7I|5.0|This book hooked me immediately.  I enjoyed it and could not put it down.  It had funny parts and lots of human nature.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Not only did this help me sleep but I sleep deeply and awake energized. This is a fab way to calm the mind. The sound quality is very good. Easy and fun to create my perfect mix.
1608871452|5.0|This book is a must for anyone that loves Supernatural. Love all of the behind the scenes stories and fun pieces that they put in,
1594746036|4.0|Ransom Riggs is a very creative man. He has taken dozens of wacky old photos and built a story around them.<br /><br />Jacob's grandfather was a Jew who escaped Nazi Germany as a child. He was sent to Wales to live out the war. When Jacob was a child, Abe (his grandfather) told metaphorical stories about the monsters who killed his family and the fantastic children's home to which he escaped.<br /><br />He also had all these strange old photos that he made up stories about - like the cover photo: a girl who could float.<br /><br />But were they just stories?<br /><br />This is a tale in a tale - Jacob trying to find his grandfather's truth while also trying to find his own. I was extremely taken with the entire story, which I think is good for middle school level.<br /><br />I subtract a star because the story does not end cleanly, and there is a quite-too-obvious pitch for this to be 1 in a series. I don't like that. Write a story and finish it. Please.<br /><br />Anyway. I enjoyed this quick read.<br /><br />(*)>
B009CF7GRY|3.0|I grew up with Footloose so I am a little more critical of this.  Thy did a good remake, making it more modern but still like the old one better.
B0059WTMLW|3.0|like any other sudoku except that the interface is limited. I would like to see where i went wrong, have a little guidance.<br />Perhaps as I play more I will figure out that the game does that for the player, but right now I cannot find it.
B001QD5OSS|4.0|Love movies based in true life!  This was good and really enjoyed it and love the actors in this movie!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I take objection with the fact that they are pulling off the secret for so long but hey, it's television, and as long as the viewer embraces the unrealistic nature of such a secret, the TV Show is well written with lots of twists, turns, and outcomes that make it fun to watch.  Oh Yea, I like the casting too.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|All the other games purchased through Amazon have downloaded perfectly.  Try as I might, this one refuses to download.  I have sent requests for help to Rovio and still not have had a reply.
B0068Y4MPG|1.0|This dvd was not worth the $5 I paid for it.  Don't waste your time.  I could not find one redeeming quality here at all.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|How would Judaism use this German? Give him a conscience and make him a hero. A tip of the hat to the director.<br /><br />Americans were bad-ass too. In the days of slavery. The movie, and this is a movie not a film, brandishes its stylized violence and wraps it around the story of a man wanting to be reunited with his wife. But it's slavery versus what the Germans did in world war two. Inferred, implied and implicit. Loved it.<br /><br />Intellectually fascinating as well as hugely entertaining as a movie experience. Beethoven's F&uuml;r Elise once again gets associated with bad deeds as in [[ASIN:B002YCVX5S Inglourious Basterds]] a film which I found unappealing. But mixed in with the cool, verbal heroism of the German and his expert bounty hunting techniques, the music does jar as a stunning contrast to the gruesome scene-end.<br /><br />Nothing like my favourite Tarantino output [[ASIN:B007JNWQZS Kill Bill: Volume One / Volume Two (Double Feature) [Blu-ray]]] but certainly recommended.
006178480X|5.0|While I don't think this was my very favorite of all the stories, it was a great read!!!!! Lots of action, suspense, old friends, new friends, unexpected twists...a definite must-read! I was a little saddened at the direction the storyline took in some parts but I guess it was inevitable. I look forward to see where the storyline goes next!!!
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a book that is a story you can't get enough of! I read The Ugly Truth thinking I wouldn't like it, but I caught on very fast and had to see how the story all came to be. This book will not disappoint anyone!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is great. This is the most addicting game I have ever played. Once you start its very hard to quit playing.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Great Album!!!! Love it!!! Love it!!! I love the musical transitions & the length of the songs. The production freaking amazing!!.  JT did a great job.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|it is twitter on a kindle. not much more to say. if you like twitter, get this app for your kindle.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I had watched this on and completely enjoyed it once again.  I would definitely recommend it.  You will  not be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I thought I would really like this game but when I went to play it the instructions were so poorly written that I couldn't figure out how it was played.  Would I recommend this to someone..NO.  The only way I would get this game again is if the instructions were more detailed.  If the instructions were updated I probably would recommend it.  It looked like a fun game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|the plots were fine in general, some not good as the others. the conversations and acting earned all the stars I can give.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|If your a fan or just like a few songs, this album has all the hits and more. Lot of music on one cd.
193700788X|1.0|The author's writing style and skills were noticeably lacking in this book. Her earlier books created a great world, with great characters and character relationships, but her more recent Sookie books have been going downhill, and this last one was definitely the worst. It was almost like she just wanted to write the final book to get it done with, and didn't want to bother with pesky things like the characters and world she had built up in the past books.<br /><br />The other \\"Most helpful\\" reviews on here point out the specific flaws in much more detail than I could, such as the massive inconsistencies in this book against the established world rules, main characters appearing for no apparent reason other than to tell you how their lives are, and the utter change or assassination of some characters and their nature, so I won't repeat all of them here and recommend you instead just sort the reviews by \\"Most Helpful\\" and read the top ones.<br /><br />I was actually OK with Sookie's final choice for a guy (although it wasn't my choice) since he did suit her best, but couldn't you have built up just a bit more of a romantic relationship between them in previous books, or even in this book for that matter? Even something like \\"OMG seeing you dead made me realize just how much I want you to be a part of my life!\\" instead of \\"I'm too busy worrying about my vampire boyfriend to consider what's going on with you\\".<br /><br />Personally, I thought that much of the book was extremely boring, and plenty of times I was left scratching my head going \\"What? That doesn't make sense.\\" or \\"That shouldn't be the case because of [insert previous book reference here]\\" or even \\"Why would he/she do that? It doesn't make sense with their character\\".<br /><br />And the whole series is about Vampires. Every book title as the word \\"Dead\\" in it. A huge part of the stories is vampires \\"coming out\\" to the rest of the world. The vampires felt completely missing from this book, and I thought itwas sad that the most satisfying vampire \\"action\\" I got was Barry relaying the vampire community gossip to Sookie.<br /><br />To summarize, I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this book, and I wish I had read a summary instead since it would have been just as (un)satisfying, and wouldn't have wasted my time/money.
B001AW156U|5.0|These triggers solve my biggest complaint with the PS3 6 axis.  The bottom buttons are too small, but adding these the remote solves that problem and make the use of L2 and R2 easy in the heat of battle.  A must have for every gamer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I've played several versions of this game and this one is my favorite. Great brain workout!!! Some versions left me dazed and confused. Clues didn't make sense as the levels got harder. I love a great challenge, but not one that exhausts me.
B0057VDGNK|3.0|The instrumental songs which comprise the majority are boring to listen to after the first play.<br /><br />Night Call and A Real Hero are the only songs I replay.<br /><br />Not 5 star.  Those reviews are bogus.
B008JFUMDS|4.0|my mom and i saw this movie with my aunt today. we really enjoyed it. it is the trick is to go to see the movie with a sense it is just for fun. i really enjoyed it. it has some great actors and actresses in it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I just started into the world of Dr. Who and I am completely hooked! The writing is very clever but what would you expect from a fifty year old franchise? Bring on the next season!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Loved almost all the episodes...did not love the last 3. The show is at its best in the episodes highlighting Castle and Beckett's fun side.
B008KPDYQY|5.0|I don't see how this is a 3 star movie.<br /><br />This film has captured the random chaos of love for this generation.  Putting things off until their \\"right,\\" and always finding a reason to postpone vs a shotgun wedding and making it work.  I feel I've seen this story play out all around me.<br /><br />Not only being incredibly true in tone for this generation, the characters are honest and real.  Even the bit parts are acted out with fully developed characters.  Everyone knew who they were.<br /><br />Maybe it was the tone.  Maybe it was the honesty.  Maybe it was the acting, but I laughed hard, out loud, many many times while watching this movie.  I give it my highest recommendation.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|This reminds me of a couple of other books/films about old blokes who go out their front door and find themselves.  It is optimistic, a good story and a nice heart warmer about love, life, relationships and coming to terms with your life.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Great story line and characters. The first two sections were thrilling and suspenseful and then......a TERRIBLE ending!  Such a disappointment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games I have played so far! This game keeps you alert and on your toes! Have to always be aware
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|This game is pretty good l like how it has music. Another thing I like about this game is the cute little animal thing
098478280X|4.0|I did like the book and I feel you will get a lot out of it. It is just one source of information though and as I never got asked any of the questions on an interview at least it gets you to think in terms of solving problems which is usually what these companies try to do on an interview. You have to also know what types of questions are applicable for the particular role, company, and industry you are applying for.
B004FEFS5E|4.0|It is a good book but doesn't live up to all the hype about it. I did learn some things but expected more from it.
B00847KFDS|5.0|we both love john....been to a few concerts.....awesome.
B00BI745AA|4.0|Only give it four stars because it kept stopping,skipping and sound repeatedly went out. Unfortunately, I did not get to watch about the last half hour of the movie because the signal was lost and kept getting a try again later message. That sucks. In a nutshell,it was a great movie,but not a good experience because of technical difficulties . Still haven't seen the ending!! Hope to get a credit to our account from AMAZON.
0307730700|5.0|There are so many books to read these days that it can make your head spin as you narrow your selection. It is only fitting that I finished reading \\"Fearless\\" by Eric Blehm on July 4th. The book focuses on Navy Seal Team SIX Operator Adam Brown.<br /><br />The book drew me in initially due to the insight it provided to the elite fighting force known as the Navy Seals. Amidst the recent movies and fanfare over the last couple of years, including my own interest in military matters, it stood out from everything else on the rack. After all the Navy Seals maintain a high level of secrecy into their teams and for good reason. My curiosity was peaked as to just what extent the author had been allowed inside an otherwise guarded area. What I didn't expect to find was such a vivid glimpse into the life of a true American hero, Adam Brown.<br /><br />Right from the beginning I connected with Adam. His passage from boy to man reminded me of many of my own thoughts and choices during that same period in my life. As the story continued to unfold I found myself connecting even more. The desires, the struggles, the searching for your place in life...it all rushed back in an instant. I found myself right in the story with Adam. Every accomplishment and every setback he encountered hit me as a man in my own journey. I had stood at that same crossroads with some of the same baggage.<br /><br />The more I could tell you about Fearless the more I would take away from the experience that comes from reading the book. While it does provide a lot of great military insight it provides a greater insight into the human heart. While the story will inspire anyone who reads the book it will resonate with every man even more. It is a story of courage, struggle, redemption, failure, faith, sacrifice, reflection and compassion. I walked away wanting to be a better husband, father, son and friend. More importantly I walked away wanting to be a stronger man of faith.<br /><br />At a time when our world so desperately needs good role models you will find the story of Adam Brown. His story, while not blemish-free, reminds us all that God uses the good and the bad in our lives for a greater purpose. Realizing that purpose and living it out on a daily basis makes a greater impact than we can ever realize.
B00COHIFQS|5.0|This is one of the best &#34;scary&#34; movies I have ever watched! It actually had a real storyline that made you care about/sympathize with the characters. The story was well told and the characters were relatable. It would be so amazing if there were more movies out there like this one. It comes close to renewing my interest in the HORROR Genre. Most horror movies out there now have no real storyline. They consist of someone who had a bad experience that blew their mind and they go off on a bloody rampage slicing and dicing anyone in their path,end of story. Thank you to those involved who made this movie an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this one to anyone who enjoys a good scary movie that actually tells a story. It gets five stars from me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is GREAT!!  They have done a wonderful job of developing characters so that the viewer feels like they are a part of the series.
B0065CCM76|4.0|Harkened me back to my teen years, and made me feel young again. Classic late 70's, early 80's rock and roll.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is very informative and helpful!  Good guide for submitting my own book.I wish I would have had this book sooner.
B00D1X0576|1.0|The expectation is that one will see a dial or gage indicating Internet speed but that is not the case at least on the kindle edition
B006M4F67A|4.0|Ive downloaded a lot of mahjong games over the years, and this one is fun and enjoyable. It worked fine on the kf
B00133KFGW|5.0|This storyline is highly improbably...but who cares? I watched it because I knew it would have a happy ending...isn't that what chic flics are about? Jonathan Rhys Meyers is fantastic as always...and the little boy is so adorable. When he spoke to the social worker...my heart came up in my throat. It's great and the music is excellent
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love this series!  I hope Mr. Martin will continue this series.  I have read book 5 and am patiently waiting for book 6!  PLEASE publish another in the series!  Your characters are wonderful!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As an adult, I can be very set in my ways and my likes and dislikes.  I have favorite types of books, clothes and foods.  We can get very stuck in our set ways and many of us are not very willing to travel outside of our comfort zone but every once in a while I get bored and need to try something different!  This is how I decided to read this book and I could not be happier that I did!  I feel like I have opened up a whole new beautiful world!  What a magical and enchanting ride!  I finished this book in only 2 days and then got in my car and went straight over to the library where I checked out more Neil Gaiman books!  Change is good!!!!
0345536886|4.0|excellent condition johm grisham is a good writer  and writes a good book.  Would recommend as good reading.<br />will read more of his books
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|For the first few chapters, I had a difficult time keeping up with the story.  The main character tells her story and jumps around from past to present.  I was also very unclear where this story was going or what the point was. But I am so glad that I kept reading!  Once she reveals her secret the story starts to come into focus.  The timeline can still get confusing at times but at the end of this book it all comes together like a giant puzzle and the results are facinating!  If you are a physchology lover then this is the book for you!  This book is so unique and so smart!  What a treat!
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Lots of action but as expected story line is well what you would expect.  Much better as a comic book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I highly recommend it. The steamy romance of Eva and Gideon leave you wanting more! Hopefully the next book will be out soon.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Bacon brings an intensity to his role that makes him SO watchable!  Scary, creeeepy for a tv show!  (not for kids)  I hope they do a 2nd season!<br /><br />Great spooky, and creepy serial killer show!  With a &#34;cult&#34; element that will keep you looking over your shoulder for the bad guy.  WHO can you trust?
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Awesome but I wish it had more levels like 50 or even 24 it tuck me 3 days to complete the game but I can steel play on multiple player
B002RXMG00|5.0|Even though this was shot back in 1960 it still creeps you out to this day!  One of my all time favorites films!  &#34;Norman Bates&#34; is a screen icon!  Who doesn't know about the &#34;shower scene&#34;?<br /><br />The Grandfather of ALL thrillers!<br /><br />Hitchcock's finest work!
B004GYY714|5.0|did not realize I could carry and listen my favorite radio stations everywhere I go now I do love it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show!! I like the costumes, the story, the drama, the accent... In one word: amazing!!! I highly recommend Downton Abbey, I'm anxious to see what gonna happen in season 4.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  Simple to do and understand.  Enjoy it greatly as a time consumer.  Very fun play.  The story line on the game is very interesting.  Only irritation with the game is the fact they want you to pay money for some of the better units but the ones that you get for in game money are pretty good.  The best units cost out of game ordeal money.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited 8months for book 3 to come out, and I was completely let down. There was way to much filler going on and not enough REAL story. Not sure if I will continue on reading this series. Completely disapointed.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Wow! Those Marines sure are tough to kill!<br /><br />James Cameron (\\"Titanic\\" and \\"The Abyss\\") spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this project and in my opinion it's worth every penny! It has a solid serviceable story with a beginning, a middle and an end. It has LOTS of blowie uppie stuff. It has two worthy adversaries... both of them Marines. It takes place on an other-worldly planet that is meticulously realized: with fantastic flora and fauna; populated by blue-hued humanoids (yup, excellent CGI) with their own language and mythology. It has plenty of humor (the first time our hero has to wear a thong...you'll laugh). And it has a sweet romance... boy meets girl...you know....<br /><br />The 3-D is so good that I automatically took a casual swipe at a pesky gnat that flew within my periphery, and the dust motes in the air are simply a realistic touch, no issue is made of them. In addition, I felt pangs of acrophobia as the characters ran atop a high tree branch or inched along a cliff's edge. This might be worth a 3-D player from Amazon.<br /><br />The terrific cast includes:<br />  * Sam Worthington, who impressed me in \\"Terminator Salvation\\" (which was actually made after \\"Avatar,\\" as this film has been over 10 years in the making). British born, Australian bred, he makes my socks roll up and down. He always starts slow then wins me over when it counts. Watch this guy!<br />  * Sigourney Weaver (\\"Snow Cake\\") is the queen of high-class Sci Fi (note the \\"Alien\\" franchise).<br />  * Zoë Saldana is a blue humanoid, so you don't get to see her wonderful face. Just remember Uhura in 2009's \\"Star Trek.\\"<br />  * Stephen Lang (\\"Men Who Stare at Goats\\") provides the leavening for the dough. Just as Othello would be just another disgruntled Moor without a cunning Iago, our hero would be just another paraplegic Marine without this kickass opponent!<br />  * Michelle Rodriguez (\\"Fast & Furious\\") is there when you need a tough chick on your side...<br /><br />I'm sure you'll be fascinated by the tiny jellyfish-type floatie things that pulsate through the air, but do NOT drink too many liquids before starting this viewing, as this thing lasts over 2.5 hours and there is no dull interval where I can suggest a visit to the litter box. Time will fly, but not if you drink too many liquids!<br /><br />Notes: 1) An avatar is an alter ego adopted by an on-line gamer, an image that embodies his/her philosophy and/or desired physical attributes. 2) Be sure to suspend disbelief!ure you'll be fascinated by the tiny jellyfish-type floatie things that pulsate through the air, but do NOT drink too many liquids before starting this viewing, as this thing lasts over 2.5 hours and there is no dull interval where I can suggest a visit to the litter box.

B00BDAP66E|1.0|This app takes the user in a loop. You download and when you try to open it brings you right back to the download page. Kindle Fire users...don't bother with this app.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|This is an okay app which is necessary if you want to use the camarea on your kindle fire.  The resolutions is a bit grainy, but if you are just looking for a free app to use your camera, this one will work.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Engaging characters make this a winner. Ready for season four. I enjoyed the season one and two summary as well..
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great read. Thank you for writing this. I had a great time reading this and it helped me continue to take steps towards my dreams. I am forever grateful.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This series draws you in. Great stories and amazing characters. I highly recommend it. I cannot wait for season three to hit prime videos.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|very good writing to keep many plots going. Amazing to see how they lived just 100 years ago. Good entertainment.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I am very upset that I purchased this item to do what I needed for work and can not open the app. Please explain why?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A great story!  Full of surprises.  I wish the book had been twice as long.<br />I'm was so sorry when it ended.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Great movie, musicals r great! Kids (all ages) love watching this movie!  I still have the cup.song in my head days later.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|The controls really are horrible, especially to place the blocks.  And as far as I could tell, there is no way to rotate the blocks like there is in tetris.  Graphics are acceptable for the type of game.  Uninstalled after one round, that I rushed half of just to finish it.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I has loooovedeeeeeedddd this thing you should read it it is a great thing just think about it byes guys NOT I hated it
B00846REIS|5.0|Clear your calendar and lock the door, you won't want to put this one down once you start it. Yum, definitely a keeper you'll go back and read again and again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers. I recommend this game to anyone. This game is awesome. This is one of my favorite games on my kindle.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|You absolutely have to buy all three Crossfire books and read them in order. This is the next best thing to Fifty Shades and some readers even like it better. You'll be on the edge of your seat as you bear witness to Eva and Gideon's wildfire romance. You'll have difficulty putting any of these books down.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Well deserved awards for this movie! You rock Ben - looking forward to other creations of yours - you're so multi-talented!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ms. Day has finally hit her stride with the Crossfire books. Better put your oven mitts on ladies, this one is a scorcher.
1603580557|5.0|This book is a very thorough yet simple introduction to systems thinking. It presents the fundamentals of systems thinking and helps the reader understand how to make sense of complex systems. A great introduction to a complex field of knowledge.
B003W5C0VW|1.0|I bought several DVDS Queen, Eagles which the audio quality was excellent. This DVD Ladies & Gentlelmen audio is bad quality not enjoyable at all, I had to put my CD  GRRR album in the background and mute the sound of the DVD.<br />Don't waste your money!
B005R7DAWG|5.0|One of the best books I ever read, by far (and I read a lot ...). A gripping tale of revenge and redemption, skillfully crafted by a master of writing, a masterpiece.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|This game is ok but not overly exciting or addicting.  It's ok if you have to pass some time waiting some where, having one and five minute timed games that are easy to play.  It doesn't have enough variety or features to hit four or five stars for me.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This was an interesting thriller with fine performances by all the actors. I had expected it to be about big pharma hiding bad test outcomes but it was so much more. Enjoyed this film very much
B00881VLCE|4.0|Just the thing to keep a toddler busy in the car or a restaurant! Both my grandson and granddaughter like it!
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|This could have been an interesting story but the story line was bumpy and often had odd connections. A few characters seemed to have been added at the whim of the production and did not add anything to the story, not even interest. I kept thinking, while watching this, that this could and should have been a much better film if a little control had been exercised.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My granddaughter loves to play dressup...so she really likes this game! She thinks the dresses are SO pretty; and likes the many choices for hair and makeup.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|i was very disapointed with this app. there was only one option...a silver like mesh weave that you could move around with your fingers.  the downdload was flawed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is the perfect balance of a challenge, and an entertaining game. The only downside is that there are only 10 floors, I finished in a couple of days on and off.
B001EBWISG|5.0|One of the best films ever made.  Well shot, great acting and dialog.  Excellent sound track.  Scorcese at his finest.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun little game. The first five levels are a little too easy, but the last five involve a lot more thought. Can't wait for more levels. All in all a great game.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|It only lasted two seasons, which is unfortunate. It was an interesting romp through the Terminator universe with a lot more potential than the studio bean counters gave it.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|You should get this game this is one of the best games that I have ever played and it is badass
B005HED11Y|5.0|It's truly amazing how good this show is and how well it stands the test of time.  My nine-year-old daughter watched this episode with me and found it genuinely interesting and entertaining.  Plus, she now gets all the &#34;Mr. Spock&#34; references on other shows.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like the game ,it is very easy to play. There are a lot of puzzles so you never run out of options.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Not much more to say.  The entire family loved this movie.  My nine-year-old daughter has seen it multiple times and was looking forward to seeing it again.
B001XUPH9K|3.0|The original Star Trek movies were a huge disappointment to me. That said, the Wrath of Kahn is one of the better ones. One of the main reasons is Ricardo Montalban, who plays Kahn. Even though he spends most of the time chewing scenery, he does a good job of it. He makes a good protagonist to Kirk and the gang, Worth watching if you are a Star Trek fan.
B008602KQI|3.0|Don't waste your time on this movie.  Watch &#34;Battle Royale&#34; instead (basically the same story--but much darker and more exciting).
B005H9B44A|1.0|I like Kenneth Branagh.  I like all the actors involved.  But the movie is really, really terrible.  Do not watch.  It is bad.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This show is such a fascinating combination of vibrant characters, settings, and situations. The acting, props, and setting are quite well done.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|What a great app. I got it non a free day, but it's well worth the money. Create favorites. And easily mix and match different sounds.<br />I use it every day.
B00006879E|5.0|This is my favorite Maroon 5 album EVER. The CD itself came packaged nicely and not broken or anything. This is a must-have!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|of the park.  He just needs the rest of the Blues with him.  Not that this isn't a very, very good single release, but there was something about the chemistry with the other Moody Blues that brought out the best in him - IMHO.  He does a great job here - his voice is as good as ever, and his delivery is top notch.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|The CD came nicely wrapped. And of course since it's maroon 5, I have to give this a five star rating. This is my second favorite Maroon 5 album. I'm obsessed!! &#60;3 You guys should get it.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Man, he STILL has that voice but with some age, wisdom, heartache to add to the mix.  I cannot recommend this CD enough.  As a matter of fact, I recommend ALL of his CDs.  If you put your &#34;way back&#34; machine in place and listen, starting with The Animals and progress to this one - you will hear a true artist.  I really like to put a couple of his latest CDs (including this one) in with some of Merle Haggard's latest, and wow!  Magic happens.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that Eric Burdon was part of the British Invasion oh those many years ago.  Where many of his peers have gone to the wayside (or gone to the great beyond), he is still doing original stuff.  Oh, I suppose he could have fallen back in his laurels, but he has a lot more to say - and he says a lot on this recording.
B00B5A9FLY|1.0|Although I have posted a review on this several times and it is no different than the good reviews I;ve posted, it seems that as long as the review is positive it will be posted while negative reviews have some sort of problem that Amazon. The only problem with this item is getting it delivered
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I have been a fan of his since the 70s.  And like some other great artists of that era, he just seems to get better.  Too bad you don't hear more of him on the radio - and I mean his latest music.  Oh sure, you hear a ton of stuff from Silk Degrees (and for good reason), but he didn't stop there.  He is STILL putting out some great, great music, not just doing the &#34;oldies&#34; type deal.  If you were hesitating about purchasing this CD, don't hesitate -  GET IT.  Put it in, sit back, relax, and enjoy.
B009VYF5E2|1.0|I have written two reviews expressing my discontent with delivery of this item and whereas all of my positive reviews for other items have been posted this one keeps getting refused. If they ever deliver it I may change my opinion
B004X75RCW|4.0|Cleaver story line, well done and Sandra Bullock is wonderful as always. I would recommend this movie to others again
B004HWYTP4|1.0|Lots of stars, guns & fireworks; but poor plot, slapstick humor, waste of time. Would not recommend this to anyone.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|This is a great series. Especially anyone interested in dancing, writing, directing, the theater.  I could go on and on but suggest u see for yourself. You won't be disappointed
B0058BI896|5.0|Are fantastic actors and actresses. Never before (Except seinfeld) have I enjoyed seeing a robotic hand show. Shared that one with friends.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Absolutely kept our attention. Great movie with a great cast. Tom Cruise is a wonderful actor full of talent. Loved this movie.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|All the songs you are looking for are here. Awesome CD.Great value for the price. A must for any collection.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Great story, second half was my favorite..slightly too slow in the beginning but well rooted. Inspiring to be a life-giving woman.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book the best of the series!  Ending brought seriousness, sadness and a smile. Definitely the darkest of the three books.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love the alarm, especially the gradual volume feature. Also love the fact that I can have the alarm wake me with my favorite Pandora music station!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am particularly intriuged by the characters and their interactions, the twists and turns  of the theme, and the cass distinctions of the period.
0307719774|5.0|This is an easy journal, with simple questions everyday.  Questions are fun, interesting, and life issue questions.  Easy to commit to write in daily.
B000JVSUS4|1.0|If I could give this bunch of garbage 0 stars I would have.<br /><br />Seriously, this is an insult to the men and women who served and/or lived through the Pearl Harbor attack.  What?  There wasn't enough drama in the REAL story so they had to make up this bunch of garbage?  I think the producers knew it was garbage too, because even the theater trailer gave no hint to the garbage that this movie was.  The trailer focused on the actual attack which, although visually done well, seemed to be an afterthought towards the end of the movie.  So, I got tricked in to going to see the movie in the theater and walked out of the theater feeling like I was actually dumber for having seen this garbage.  By the way, did I mention that this movie is garbage?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.  Preserve your intelligence and avoid this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is super fun unless you get a nous mad and then ut gets destroyd this game is wxelent for a passtime
0061124958|5.0|My niece read this book over and over again.  We also purchased the audio version, read by E. B. Webb - we both loved listening to him read this awesome story! &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really thought this was the end of the series, so that is where my main disappointment lies....I have to wait for another book!  The story didn't offer as much as book 1 & 2, but if you liked those, I recommend this.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Enjoyed this book. Learned a lot about orphans and their lives during this era. I would recommend reading this book.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|if your into all the super hero stuff, this is definitely the movie you must own. there is no other like it, in fact you should get the whole avengers movies, from the hulk, to iron man 1&2 and the others in between. all great movies.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|One of the few war movies with a German perspective. I saw this movie originally in the early 80s. It was great then, it's great now. There were two version of this film, one in German, with subtitles, and a version with English dubbing. The German language version is the best. Even though you don't understand the words, the emotions come through. Not so much in the English version. I read that the movie was shot on a set the size of a submarine so as to give the audience the feeling of close quarters. Subs are called pig boats, and you can practically smell the stench of the crews' quarters and feel the oppressive heat of the engine room.<br /><br />I've been pleasantly surprised watching it on the Kindle Fire. The small screen doesn't take away from the sense of being there. In fact, it probably adds to the closed-in feeling of the sub.
B004B63M1S|5.0|movie was good, had all kinds of s*** going on. bunch of hooters all over the place all that was needed was Jessica albas to be shown.
B0002BO05S|5.0|awesome movie i had seen this movie many times before and it's a great Christian classic and the price is great dvd is like new no problems here
B0090SI42Y|5.0|movies was great, you got a lot of action and fight scenes. if that's what your into then this is definitely the movie for you, not to mention the have some good looking women too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a most engaging read! I really enjoyed it! It kept me interested throughout. The plot was sort of crazy but mostly believable.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|thought this would be a chick flick, turned out it kind of was but man the chicks in this movie are bad ass. I would let them kick my ass any day. great movie, don't watch it with you chick if she isn't to sure about herself, don't watch it with your girl if she tends to get violent, she will try to kick your ass once the movie is over. on the plus sided, good looking girls full of action, gun fights, girls looking like hoochie mamas, great movie.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|All the bits were there; good actors, good production values, but it just didn't gel into a great flick.  Watchable, and with good direction, a sequel could pull it out of mediocracy.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|movie has all kinds of great actors, im a big fan of Robert rodriguez so therefore I had to buy this movie. movies is great has good action and lots of women.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard but not too easy either. My girls and I had lots of fun trying to find all the clues.
B004S699LI|5.0|movie is bad ass, if your into all that vampire s*** and people shooting and half naked women dancing. movie is definitely a must, and you get to see salma hayek in nothing but her chonis.
B008D36INE|5.0|This film is alluring in the form of slow and intimate heartbreak. It is not over dramatized and is rather more real with the type of emotions involved in affairs and poisonous relationships. I believe this film is honestly beautiful from start to finish. I can understand why others wouldn't like it though because of the fact that it is so slow, but sometimes you need to pay special and slow attention to the greatest works of art to fully understand its honest beauty.<br />I've watched this film many times now and each time it strikes a chord with me.<br />Magnificently done.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This was a terrific book.  So often the weeds of life choke off our ability to breath.  It is high time to tend the garden.  I badly miss the smell of fresh basil, and wax beans.  Thank you for the inspiration.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|This movie is so awesome.  Not really suited for the very young child.  As an adult love the fast pace action!
B005DJREJS|3.0|It was watchable, but definitely for teens not adults. There were a few funny scenes, however I could only watch about 3 episodes...
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|I always loved this movie it is the epitome of crime mob dramas well scripted directed and masterfully acted  I am a real film buff and this movie should be in anybody that calls themselves a movie specialist top 5 the best movie ever!
B003LQ3YXU|2.0|Didn't make it through the first episode. The acting was so bad it was distracting. Don't understand why all the high ratings!? Maybe it's me.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This one ties all my emotions in a knot , its touching and sexy in a dangerous way the characters intermixed so smoothly . Can't wait to read the next book . Bought this one for my birthdat wow !
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I guess I have to assume I'm different than all of the other reviewers that loved this book. I just found it to be...okay. Not much too it, a little lacking, in my opinion. Quick, easy read.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Honestly, the best album I've ever bought. I typically prefer to buy songs individually, but she's got an amazing compilation of music all in one go here. Mad props to her.
B00AEUPOVQ|3.0|Too slow and needed more explanation on the plot of the show.  I would not recommend it.  No explain action on the ending.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|it was a cute movie....well as cute as a zombie movie can be, my niece picked the movie that night and we both enjoyed it.
B008MM9630|5.0|Not a bad game bit low graphics but fine for a little mindless building. Not much else to say but have to type x amount of words. Lol.
B00AIBZM40|5.0|Very entertaining to watch. If you like thrillers this one is good and highly recommend you see &#34;Mama&#34;. Enjoyed the twist and turns.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|I loved this movie! Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play such roles they never have before! My favorite part of the movie is his last memory of her in the house on the beach. What a great story! Makes you wonder how many times they have erased their memory in the past!
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Ok, so more reviews were posted negatively about this movie. But since I am a Die Hard Bruce Willis fan I believe this was another nice hit in the Die Hard series. I'll admit the classics were a lot better in the die hard series, but this one is good too. If you enjoy some Bruce Willis action I recommend giving this a chance!!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Is was fun while it lasted. I could've done without the cheesy soundtrack and poor story. I hope the next one sticks more with just solving the puzzles which is for the best thing about it
B000008GHW|5.0|AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH, The CD was great The hype was more fun ...... and yeah, so I was walkin to the yellow brick road....
0446541478|5.0|Wonderful Wonderful Book.  Would highly recommend it for everyone!!!
B00466HM28|5.0|My son purchased this keyboard for making music for his students films. It has worked great and so far he has made great use of it. Good quality and I would recommend it again.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like this Facebook app. It is so convenient which makes it quite a bit distracting from my work, though.
B00338QENI|5.0|I read this book for summer reading because it was required by my high school for me to read it. It was definitely an intense and interesting read. I learned many new medical terms, vocabulary words, and scientific information. It was a challenging book for a ninth-grader such as myself.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Buy the CD, this kid is amazingly talented, its been a while since a new artist has been this raw.  I'm certain that we are witnessing the birth of greatness, perhaps one day someone will write a song titled \\"I let J. Cole down.\\"<br /><br />Tired of waiting, would somebody please crown the new KING!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I like games every once in awhile that make you think--enjoyed the Mist game and figured this was similar.  The graphics were awesome on my Kindle Fire HD. No problems loading or crashing. The music and background sounds kinda creepy and mysterious, but that's the fun of it, right? It was just complicated enough to not get discouraged and I avoided the hints except for once--I had the sound turned off (late night in bed) and the hint was 'what was that clicking sound?' Well, kept the sound on after that and invested in earbuds. I was disapointed at the end because I expected to enter another level or another room, but it was over. I hope there is a sequel or a Room 2.
B001J2WNE4|4.0|Full disclosure, I love John Legend, he is a truly special artist and this CD has some bangers.  I still prefer his first CD but you can see the maturity and growth in this CD.  Just wish this guy would put out more music, more often.....please....
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is addicting. Only one finger required to play so I played it a lot while breastfeeding. Especially at night, helped take my mind off how long it takes to breastfeed in the middle of the night
B005OYKIJ0|5.0|This was very entertaining. I really enjoyed it. The story was good, the action sequences are unbelievable Hollywood style. Still it is what is it, action packed, decent plot lines, good acting and eye candy for the ladies or guys. A bit of everything for everybody especially action junkies. I would recommend if you enjoy the thrill of car racing and reckless stunts.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|have been using this case on my Kindle for 20 months of daily use and it still looks good and seems like good protection- the Kindle has been dropped a few times and no damage. the stand is easy to use and works well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I recommend the book. It's a quick easy read. The story is entertaining, suspenseful and has some humor in it. The only downside is that I'm left wanting to know what happens next!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can not wait until the next book come out. I just hate it for it is almost to far in between books. I will just have to wait on pins and needles. Thank you Silvia Day I love your books.
030758836X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read this year. A page turner. Great read. Highly recommend it.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't watched it yet. Its an awesome series, one of the best I've watched
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Free bingo! What else can I say? Although: as with any app : you need to empty your cache on a regular basis. If u don't...there will be problems ...slow to load and freezing.  That's the worst thing about this game. Otherwise its great!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Awesome Series once of the best I've seen.<br /><br />I got hooked on this the first time I watched it, I'd recommend this to anyone
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It was an interesing read. However it was very hard to follow because of the characters.  The mixture of generations of different families made it difficult to maintain continuity.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this show...the characters are interesting, unique storylines, beautiful sets and costumes and the actors' work is outstanding and top quality.  I will miss Matthew tremendously though. Can't wait for Season 4.
B00CVCG87O|4.0|The ONLY reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I think the singer gets a little boring at times, because he doesn't stray much from the long notes he holds out, but on a couple songs you can hear that he does show his versatility, just wish he did that more. Also, the bass is mixed pretty heavy and it would have been cool if the bass was a little more complex. Other than that the melodies, the mix, I like how the vocals were not mixed so much as the forefront and sound more like a blended instrument rather than most rock and pop albums, may not work for every style of music, but it really worked here! Either way buy this album, you wont regret it!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|One problem i am having a hard time learning it. How to get from the book your reading back to the books you got. you cant make a library like on the Nook to make shelf of what is new and what you read. so gonna be hard to remember.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I very much enjoyed both books.  I always look forward to Dorthea Benton Franks new books.  Her books are always a delight to read
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! It really works your brain :) &amp; it's pretty challenging but keeps me occupied ! I can't stop playing it until I've been able to solve it. It was a great choice for a download.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Sword play is a little slow but graphics are nice background is creative. Wish and hope boards on higher levels are just as colorful.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|game I can't put down haven't stop playing since I downloaded it I recommend for everyone who like stuff like this
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great game...made so u don't HAVE to spend MONEY, also great for strategists.<br />although u do have to put some time into it, it climaxes very quickly, don't abandon it after 5 minutes!!! give a couple hours and you will like it.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|really like it; it makes me think a lot. It is challenging and I really play a lot. I'm glad I selected it.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Adichie  quickly draws the reader into the life of a complex,intelligent,assertive Nigerian girl who studies in Nigeria and then in the eastern US,eventually in a fellowship @ Princeton. She develops a successful blog as a sideline that presents wonderful observations on being black in the US,on the lives of African American women in the US and eventually about being Nigerian in Nigeria..She is funny.engaging and serious about these 2 cultures and their relationships to the larger cultures in which they live.<br />There are many engaging characters and situations,and occasionally the book seems to contain short stories,but eventually they all tie together.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Both my grand-daughter and I like to play it. We see who can advance first. It is usually her though.
0374290024|3.0|This book is interesting in the author's structured approach to historical patterns.  However, it could use a total rewrite with a giant step away from the academic style of the author.  He's clearly incredibly knowledgeable, but he might want to dumb it down a little to set forth his thesis for the educated, but non-academic reader.  I got very confused when he was busy disproving some hypotheses to support his point.  Just when he had built up the point, he intended to disprove it, making this reader frequently ask, where and how are we going with this.  I realize this is what academics do, and how they do it, but a book that seeks an audience beyond the Ph.D. committee should make its point in a straightforward path to its conclusion.  His next book will need a strong, clear editor.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I really like it for keeping in touch with my friends and relatives.It is so easy and quick. I'm glad I signed up.
159420411X|5.0|Strong on the technical underpinnings of statistics, but very readable!!  I loved this book.  It's timely with regard to elections but also timeless in its presentation with great examples. Everyone who follows the news should take Nate Silver's book very seriously and apply it to the tons of journalistic nonsense out there!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|A good way to burn time. The graphics are awesome. Combat is simple, monsters are challenging. Really had a lot of fun.
1781162646|5.0|After all these years, I thought I could get closer to how his mind works, but failed again.  This book had me interested from the beginning.
0764169742|5.0|This book is beautifully illustrated, and detailed enough to help me get acquainted with colored pencil drawing.  I'm looking forward to assembling the materials suggested and exploring the techniques.  I've got a huge number of flowers and vegetables around my house this year that I'm eager to sketch and feel that this book is a great catalyst and resource to make it happen.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|SPIELBURG VERSION OF LINCOLN. Hated the movie. Boring. Dull. Missed the history. Waste of time all around. Do not understand any critical acclaim or the raves other than the libby loos love it.
B00634UVX8|5.0|Working for food scraps from the kitchens of restaurants during the great depression and other lessons about &#34;the more you pay for food, the more you are sure it has been miss-handled by disgruntled kitchen employees!&#34;
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Waiting for Season 3 to be uploaded.  Amazon should work on uploading more USA Network shows.  Also more free episodic shows in general should be added to the library for &#34;Prime&#34; customers.
B004K6M0OO|4.0|Very good biography of a news reporter in the trenches of a revolutionary civil war. Important reading in view of recent events in Libya, Syria and Egypt! Fairly unbiased view of the political forces within the Republican camp. The Popular front tactic used by the Communist party and conservative Republican forces actually erode the revolution and it's gains from within.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Castle has to be one of the best shows around. It's an adventure-mystery detective show that you can watch with your whole family. One thing the writers should remember, allowing the major characters to &#34;find each other&#34;, is the prelude to cancellation.
B009R659L8|5.0|Awesome! It was a great book,interesting and a kind of book you can't put down. Would recommend this book for sure.
B008602KQI|3.0|I am an avid reader of the Hunger Games series, and was very excited to see the movie. The very first day I could spare the time I rushed to our local theater and got in line to see the long awaited movie. And...I waited. And waited. And finally, after nearly an hour of sappy shallow teenage-girl heart flutters twilight-style, we finally get to the games themselves. Yay! And after a bit of great action-packed sequences, (and some more shallow smooching idiots, we reach the grand climax, which is well done. And then....BAM! It's over.<br />My major issue with this movie is the shallowness. Now, I admit to being somewhat of a romance hater, but this was just poorly done. I can sit through some romance scenes, but these were awkward, broken, and more boring that twilight.<br />So, overall, there was nothing special, some flaws, some excellent parts, but certainly not on par with Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.
B0094M2ITG|4.0|This movie has been around for a while and many have seen it.  If you havent, I suggest you give it a try.  It is worth watching this movie with families.
B000HAB4KS|4.0|This is classic dystopia projection into the future of current trends. Amazing special effects, decent character development. Hard to believe it took me so long to get around to seeing it!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is one of my favourite albums of all time. It never gets 'old'. It is truly a timeless album. What can i say that hasn't already been said? Buy this album, you won';t be disappointed!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game kind of challenging I just wish there were more levels to it. Smooth pictures and it isnt an in app purchase app so thats awesome
B007REV4T8|5.0|This Bond movie is one of my favourites of the long running franchise. The performances are all solid. I have been really happy with EON's choice of Bond Girls, sticking with fairly unknown actresses with talent. These girls don't disappoint here! Nor does Bardem's baddie. What a frightening yet charismatic villain. You'd want to hang out with the guy but you'd be scared to death all the while. I was reminded of past baddies created by Fleming and how they appeared in the books, and was strongly reminded of a few classic guys with Silva. Judy Dench finally got a meatier plot-line and it was wonderful to see. The ending, the ending of Skyfall made me giddy and it did what a Bond film should do entertain and make you excited for the next film. Mission accomplished!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I picked this rating because I am always playing this game before others.<br />It is challenging and fun, while I am always trying to remember the road. I think that anyone would have fun with it.
B00AYHK7RU|4.0|I wanted to be completely in love with this album. Unfortunately, although I do like it, I don't love it. It is solid, the performances are flawless. The quality is there no doubt. Perhaps it was because I for years wanted an album again and so I probably made it 'bigger' in my imagination and maybe nothing could live up to that. There was just too many shades of Hours, Heathen, and Reality. Being so used to Bowie being the one leaps ahead of the game, this album felt behind the pack. Is it a poor album? No absolutely not. It's good, but not as great. But even a 'good' Bowie album is better than most of the music out there. This is a good album for newcomers, but I suspect long time Bowie fans might be a touch disappointed. But only just a touch,
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This added another piece of information for my mind to contemplate. I found this comforting as I have just lost my Mother and am watching my sister battle with ovarian cancer to the inevitable end. As for whether it is true or not, I guess we will all find that out, in time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very good! I enjoyed the whole season! Can't wait to watch more.  I will recommend this to all my friends and family.
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|Awesome and challenging! Would give this game 5 stars but force closes after every other level on my kindle fire.
0345529057|5.0|He enjoys the TV show and wanted to read the books.  Nice set for the money.  He is enjoying the first book now.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was expecting more from this.  I was excited to be reading the end just to find out it was not the end.  Although I liked some of what happened I really am disappointed it is being drawn out... It really was not worth waiting so impatiently for.
147674355X|5.0|Okay, I'm struggling to put my thoughts together for this one.  I had no clue that that's what I was getting myself into when I started the book!  The story is about a teenage girl, Sky, who has been sheltered and home-schooled all her life and is about to go to actual high school for the first time for her senior year.  Her adoptive mother also doesn't believe in technology.  So, Sky has never experienced texting or Facebook or any such things.  One day, Sky meets a boy, Holder, who is immediately drawn to her and she to him.  You know this story, right?  Unrealistic and a bit too much to handle at times (albeit enjoyable though).  However, Hopeless isn't what you are thinking it is.  There's an actual reason why these two are drawn to each other in such a powerful way and we spend the whole novel exploring it, while getting bombs dropped on us left and right!<br /><br />This story was so powerful and full of emotion and conflict.  I could literally not put it down at times.  I just had to keep reading to see what was going to happen or to find out what the hell happened to Sky/Holder/others involved.  I was so incredibly wrapped up in this story.  Hopeless grabbed me right from the beginning and wouldn't let me go until I finished it!  Talk about an emotional roller coaster.  Hoover is nothing if not an amazing story-teller.  She portrays emotions onto the reader like nobody's business.  I was right along with Sky in everything that she went through and felt it all with her.  Hoover also (and I don't know how) managed to add witty -- and, at times, humourous -- writing in there with all the drama.  It was lovely and refreshing.  I found myself laughing out loud on minute and crying the next (okay, not really crying.  I don't cry.  There has only been one book that made me cry and it was only for, like, a second).<br /><br />The characters were also really good and very well-developed.  The story is told in first person from Sky's point of view.  Sky is strong and stubborn, but has a soft side of course.  She goes through A LOT in this novel and is able to hang in there.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that handsome, sensitive, \\"bad\\"boy, Holder is by her side throughout everything.  Both great characters.<br /><br />I would definitely, highly recommend this book to any lovers of romance, heart-felt, heart-shattering, dramatic novels.  I'm glad that Hopeless was able to live up to my expectations, because it does have a 4.55/5 star rating on Goodreads after 56,916 ratings!  I'm glad that I was able to enjoy this one as much as everyone else!stubborn, but has a soft side of course.  She goes through A LOT in this novel and is able to hang in there.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|Easy to connect my Kindle to my TV (as long as you have the TVs with HDMI port). Able to watch movies that were in my Kindle in my TV. Very happy with it.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Surprisingly  I really enjoyed it.  very fun show.  Cannot wait to sea more.  Will wait for season to be on Prime
B001P7HUF0|5.0|We had read the book before watching the movie, John Grisham is a favorite author, the movie was a brilliant adaptation of the book.Very entertaining.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I got addicted to this show after watching season 1 on netflix... I couldn't get enough! I watched all 3 seasons and can't wait for season 4 (although I can't say I love what happened to certain people).
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|I was completely hooked by the previous season, but this one is even better. The story starts showing more complexity when now it's not only a matter of surviving the walkers, but also the conflicts among the living are taken to the next level. As the group led by Rick leaves Atlanta, we get huge amounts of thrills, a bunch of gruesome scenes and an enthralling story line.<br /><br />I am pretty much unable to stop watching these, I am already into season 3 and looking into getting the graphic novels so I can see ahead in what happens when the season ends. This is one of the best shows I have ever found, full stop.
B00004XPPB|3.0|Al shold start to choose his roles more carefully and diverify a little further than just adding a few differenct words in his vocabulary here and there.<br /><br />Overall, based on a real story both Pachino and Depp do a great job in portraying the overall theme of the movie.... even though it is obvious what each next scene will be.<br /><br />It is worth a purchase on the discount shelf.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I've been waiting on this to get to rental ever since it was released. It takes the Grimm fairytale of Hansel and Gretel, and lets you see them as grown up witch hunters (instead of kids escaping from cannibal witches who live in candy houses). As for children viewing it, well, if you would read your kids the true original Hansel and Gretel story, then this is definitely not any worse than that - or them watching the fight-action in GI Joe. As for the movie, the acting is great, some of the tongue-in-cheek lines are hilarious, the dialog in general is very good, the cinematography is top-line, and the story is very good and flowing, with a great finish. I give it 4-stars because of a couple of things that happened in the movie, that were 'too formulaic' to a tragic adventure that I thought didn't 'have to' happen, but did. Just my perspective, I don't think that would affect everyone who watches it. Don't believe all the 3-stars and less, I think there are a lot of 'hard-core-horror' fans out there watching this, then bashing it because it is 'soft'. It isn't meant to be horror, but adventure. IT is DEFINITELY worth the rental!
6305910324|5.0|Anyone....Anyone of all ages should not only be able to enjoy this movie but can also learn personally  many of the true values in life.<br /><br />The acting is so natural you just get caught up in the movie forgetting it is a real movie.<br /><br />It is exciting and humbling the entire movie and you will find yourself and other members of your family viewing it over and over again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its amazing!!! And its cheaper than a real horse too. ahhhhhhhhhh I love it so much because I have always wanted a horse and now I have one.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|The fours disc set continues to set the bar on this relatively inknown series.<br /><br />It just needs more attention to viewing eyeballs searching the networks to stumble upon it or find it in some other ways.<br /><br />Once viewed, the consumer will struggle how to see more episodes.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This is a fun game and more challenging than I thought it would be. It's fast-paced and can become addictive.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|What can I say.<br /><br />Denzel continues to shock and amaze me with his ability to bring to life seriously difficult roles actors have to portray.<br /><br />Denzel continues to just get better and better and this film is no excemption.<br /><br />It just doesn't get any better than this.<br /><br />In turn, I have gone out and purchased all of his major roles (Man on Fire - his best movie to date in my opinion- ,Training Day, Philidelphia, Safe House...etc)<br /><br />Denzel is one of the best actors in the world today continue to collect his DVD's while he is still in his prime.  It is up to Denzel however to continue picking the best movies to suit is far ranging skills.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read the book in a day and couldnt put it down at all. Very witty and insightful. Full of true emotional characters being honest and demonstrating such maturity and wisdom.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Rather poor way to try and use science and make it a game. Not worth the time to download the game
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|This is the first Preston/Child book that I haven't liked...at all. Secret Nazi experiments, Brazilian hideouts, the wife returning for about 10 seconds and an almost frantic rushed ending!  The whole story line was just ruined. I got \\"hooked\\" on the series because of the oddness of Pendergast, the interesting cases and the interesting cast of characters. It's like the authors needed to have more pages so they threw in every cheap storyline they could.<br />OK so let me guess...next book will have Corrie running around sticking her nose into other people's business instead of concentrating on school. Then  (haha! surprise) Alban will be doing bad things for 3 books like Uncle Diogenes am I right? Then the authors will probably write separate books until they figure out how to end the series--that is if anyone cares by that time!!  Sorry guys you really disappoint on this one.
B003R0MF5I|3.0|This season wasn't entertaining as other seasons. Was not engaging as the other seasons were. Was boring, hard to stay interested.
B002KKCWP4|5.0|This is my second pair of Teva sandals just like these.  I wore the first pair into the ground after several years, and my second pair is now doing great!
B00005JMEW|5.0|My daughter could not find this movie to finish her &#34;Kill Bill&#34; collection...so I found it for her and gave it to her as a surprise! She was VERY happy!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Best book I ever read wish there was a book 4. Can't wait for the next 2 movies to come out
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|great childrens movie had all the good values and lots of fun for the kids to watch would recommend for the family
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|I thought the organization of the book supported my learning. I liked the numerous specific examples and belittled summaries on the chapters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is well worth the play. Some levels are a little odd, but mind boggling enough to be entertaining without full on frustration.  A definite keeper in the tabs list.
B005GSZZ1A|2.0|I didn't realize it was so short and it was not as in-depth as I was expecting. many more out there that are more in depth.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|A thought provoking book which should be read in conjunction with the Richmal Crompton books and the book of Revelations. Worth reading several times to savour the two authors' brilliant humour and plot.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Compelling, shocking, intriguing and beautifully written! I feel as if I know these characters. Their twisted yet rational thoughts are so credible it shakes me to the core.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Bruce does and says what you expect- outside of that- nothing too exciting. Bruce looks good. I'm glad I waited to watch on video.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|the movie was very good the actors was great the story was about the furture hallie and tom were good
B006LSZECO|2.0|Didn't like the ending.  Will not recommend to any of my friends, Will not read any of her books if they are similiar.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The free game seems really great with its hints and arrows.  I like that someone occasionally speaks. And the under water scenes are cool. This is the first big fish game I have played.  If the full version is not too expensive  I will buy it.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|If you still think that university education is they key to success - you might be wrong.<br /><br />This book covers lot of James failures and life stories, but only at the beginning of the book you can understand why it has happened to him and lot of Americans. You can get a view of a bigger picture of what is coming in the future.<br /><br />Here you can find answers how to perform and what to do in your life to be successful in new world where no one is going to take care of you.<br /><br />The writing style is too emotional but covering few good points.<br /><br />Guess it has happened to lot of people, but only few have written books about their fails.<br /><br />Those who succeeded don't even speak about that, they are just doing things right.
B004N6369Y|2.0|I have been a Danielle Steel fan for years and have become disappointed in the writing. I used to preorder the books because I was so excited but now I find that I will order them only if I find them on sale. The writing has declined for example in this book it felt like the first three chapters went on and on describing characters and not getting into any type of plot. This book, like several of the more recent are good books to read when you are multi tasking. You do not have to pay attention to detail.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is an intelligent show that is funny and has a twist to solve problems presented in each show. There are multiple story lines and you really get to know each of the characters' personalities. I have just started season 2 and I can't wait to see what else develops. Love this show.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo game out there. Great fun. Would be better if the would offer more specials and quick reducing power ups.
B008M721MS|5.0|Chose rating because fun to use enjoy talking to family and friends when you can see them. O would recommend to my friends
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|This app does not load everything. Calendar will not work at all. The email does not open attachments  i deleted it from my kindle.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Great songs, the best Queensryche since the 90's. The live show is better than ever also! LaTorre fits perfectly with the Ryche on both the new album and the entire catalog. Rockenfield is better than ever!
142312166X|5.0|Great book also great appearance no scratches or tearing I love it and so does my grandson this was a great gift for him for graduation.
B004K6LJ3W|1.0|I had purchased the set and was very upset when I found out the do not work on United States DVD players. I contacted Amazon but I had waited to long and they will not return it.  It takes a special dvd player.  I have five different ones and it won't work on any
B00A6RCSKC|2.0|Cool game and fun but it goes like 10 stages being moderate difficulty then all the sudden levels are impossible unless you spend cash on items to give free lives or extra starter gold.  I'd expect that from a free game but this game cost $2 and that is unacceptable to charge for a game AND make it freemium to the point you have to spend money to play.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|IT'S FUN AND ADDICTIVE! But they made changes lately that make it impossible to bingo and collect items. You MUST have teammates to complete rooms because there is always just one item in each room room that you can't get on your own...someone else must provide it.
