B00DZVKQGY|5.0|Throughout history, all the greatest novelists construct a complex world of human events in what seems like an inhumane world that offers little or nothing for young girls.  To just emotionally survive requires a struggle to undergo wanted and unwanted life changes.  Jams N. Roses adeptly provides us with a novel that bonds us with the character Amanda, during her life journey, as she finds her feet.
B000QJM8Z0|4.0|Such an amazing book. Love the romance and the characters. Could read and watch the move a thousand times. V.G. Book
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Interesting twists as well as some more obvious and expected. All in all not a bad read. Looking forward to the next installment.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Although the book is better, which is usually the case, the movie does a good job of staying true to the book.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Really appreciated the care the author took in developing the characters and bringing India to life.  Would recommend this to my friends and book groups!
B000FP2OPY|4.0|I am going to be honest and admit that I wasn't all that in to this series after the first four episodes. In fact it wasn't until half way through disc two that I even really started liking Dean and Sam and the shows. Why? I thought they were a little cheesy and then, then, they just started getting good. I don't know if it was the action, the acting or just the creeptastic affect the shows took on but either way, I was in love by the end of disc two (8 episodes in), now I am hooked! I love how funny Dean is and how protective of Sam he is. I love Sam's abilities and can't wait to see how they develop over the course of the show. The brother dynamic is awesome and very real feeling.<br /><br />The ending on this one was a killer and I can't wait to dive into Season Two. Warning though, even though I thought these were slightly cheesy in the beginning, they do get better and definitely more creepy as they go. In fact some were downright scary and I love every minute of it!!
0064430227|3.0|I purchased this book under the assumption that it was \\"new\\". When it arrived, it was bent and scratched and was no way possible in new condition. The only upside was there was fast shipping...
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|these 'kid' animation movies have plenty of adult humor in them and my kids enjoyed it also....mostly....the guy with the big nose kinda freaked my 5 year old a bit.

B007GE2H3G|4.0|I thought this movie was fun, face-paced, humorous and mostly clean.  I did not like how the Captain had to have alcohol like Pop-eye needed Spinach. Non-the-less, it's fun entertainment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Since I have received YouVersion Bible it has given me the motivation to step up my devotions. Great convenient app!
0385523394|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time. It is both an in depth perspective into the deep flaws in the US penitentiary system and a beautiful story of women from all walks of life dealing with the consequences of some bad decisions and getting to know themselves when every single thing, person, and life distraction is removed from the equation. One of my favorite quotes was \\"...our current criminal justice system has no provision for restorative justice, in which an offender confronts the damage they have done and tries to make it right to the people they have harmed. I was lucky to to get there on my own, with the help of the women I met. Instead, out system of \\"corrections\\" is about arm's-length revenge and retribution, all day and all night. Then its overseers wonder why people leave prison more broken than when they went in.\\"

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Good story, fantastic scenery, and for once Cruise died (kind-of) in a movie.  Excellent supporting cast and good explanation of who/why/what happened to create the story

B001NVIZ3E|5.0|Classic adventure film- great costumes, fun acting, Great family movie, clean romance, even the violence has touches of humor. Real good guys vs bad guys. I love this movie.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I LOVE IT BUT I GUESS I JUST DONT NO HOW TO GET AROUND IT.  I TRIED TO LOOK UP  A PLANT NAMED QUINCE DBL TAKE SCARLET.  AND WENT ALL AROUND THE PLACE.  NEVER GOT A PICTURE OR ANYTHING.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This is the best documentary I've seen in a long time. Anyone who lived with the music of the late 60's, 70's and 80's, even into the 90's will really appreciate this documentary.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Great acting, delightful characters - eveyone felt so REAL!<br />Great music...and wonderful cinematography!<br />Dustin Hoffman's direction was great!<br />This movie is highly recommended!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I bought the CD based on one song it contains but love all the contents. I highly recommend this CD for Guns n Roses fans and more.
B00B8YSIMY|4.0|Okay, so I'm going to be truthful... This isn't my usual genre of preferred reads. Normally I try to avoid thrillers (and mystery), so the fact that this did entertain me enough to read slightly shocked me. I am giving it four stars out of five because of the fact that it was a little on the slow side and some things seemed stretched out.<br /> Now the story it did leave you screaming `what are you doing'. Multiple times. It pulls you into a reality that can and does occur. Being a drug book, I don't know if this was the point it was aiming for, but it really did make you hate all the characters. In a good way, not bad.<br />The character Jimmy is the idiot in the story, yes idiot. He's talked into a drug business after seeming to not be interested. Jason, he's just crazy. Loco crazy. Those are the only to characters I'm going to mention as they are in the summery. But there are two others that also lead the story on an opposite side.<br /> There is lots of violence and dark scenes so I don't recommended this for the light reader, but everyone else that likes violent thrillers this is your book
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|My Sr. Pastor once asked me, in a time of my faith crisis, &#34;What if Jesus had never lived. Would you be or act any different?&#34; Maybe the question should become, &#34;What if the Jesus that lived is not the Jesus you were raised to believe in? Will you become something different?&#34; Reading this book will become a very personal experience, unique to each individual. Do you dare take a bite from the apple of knowledge?!<br /><br />Just as theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking's &#34;A Brief History of Time&#34; help reduce certain Physics concepts down to understandable, non-scientist levels, Reza book here takes the vast works of biblical theologians and scholars (including Dr. Aslan himself) and boils it down to a very readable and understandable study of The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this book in a &#34;book club&#34; like format, with friends and family who embrace the search for knowledge and aren't afraid to have their faith comfort shook a little...maybe a lot!
B00A285OOW|4.0|This is a very good book.  It kept me interested unto the very end and had a surprising ending.  Enjoyable.
B0002IQMKM|3.0|remembered this because it was the music I took on vacation.<br /><br />was not as good as I thought, only a few songs
B001EC0OPO|5.0|I loved this film and had to share it with my grandson.  He is 11 but was able to really enjoy it with me.  Glen Close and Jack Nickolson are just the beginning of a great cast.  This film is a winner.  It does have one or two slower spots but as films go I thought it was terrific.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is one of the more peaceful, (a lot less banging and explosions) and respectful shows. It moves along at a respectable pace and leaves us thinking that life could, in fact, have been lived in this manner 'once upon a time'.
0307352153|5.0|My introverted Tai Chi teacher recommended this book. I loved getting the viewpoints of Introverted people and appreciated understanding my teacher more.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Had no idea what to expect when I bought this book but i was very pleased with it.  I couldn't put it down😊! It does not feel like the book is over 500 pages, you just wanna continue to find out what happens between Christian and Ana.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is really good. there is a battle and lots of people die. i liked the whole trilogy. but mockingjay was the best.

B000SW2F8K|5.0|This movie is best suited to adults.  This shows how some people feel about love & romance.<br />Very good actors.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|The ginger can act but, the world is really doomed if there are three bazillion Toms cruising over head.<br /><br />But really folks, Tom destroyed this movie.  He couldn't play a love scene if (you fill in the blank)...<br /><br />AND even if Morgan Freeman was only in the movie a few seconds (they should have called it a cameo), he was unbelievable.  Really, you can't believe it's even him much less the character he's playing.<br /><br />It is however, no wonder they didn't develop his character.  I mean, all Tom Cruise movies must have TOM CRUISE in every moment of the flick.<br /><br />Three stars for the adaptation of the Moon plot for Tom.
B004V9MU86|5.0|I was hooked on this book from start to finish.<br />I love books set in this era that focus on an individuals journey and the hardships they face.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it makes you think. It will help you if you ever got locked in a room and couldn't get out.

8466320709|5.0|As always, Arturo Perez-Reverte wrote a wonderful novel. You want to keep turning the pages to see what comes next.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|My brother told my I just had to read this series and I have to say, my little brother was right! It is a great story along the lines of my favorite authors of Tolkien and McCaffrey! It is written in a very authentic style, each chapter is devoted to a specific individual. It is definitely a challenging read but I have not been able to put it down and have to plug my kindle in nightly!! I would recommend it highly!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|It's not great......you need points to play which sucks......and it is only finding things in a picture which gets boring......Azada is way better
B000FBJHZS|3.0|Even though it is still an entertaining book, I had higher expectations for Dan Brown. It is still worth reading it as it captivates your attention. However, if you are looking for a book that will captivate your attention done by  Angels and Demons or the Davinci Code, then lower your expectations a notch.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game really need to use your imagination and be aware anything yen can be a clue.  Fun to play with multiple users because everyone finds different things first.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|My husband and I are hooked on the Borgias - thoroughly enjoyed both two seasons and looking forward to the third when it comes out on DVD.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|It takes a while to get into but it was a pretty good book. So if you are reading it you should keep reading it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I choose this rating because it was a captivating story. The only thing I didn't like about the book was how disturbing it was but I still loved it and would highly recommend it for a book club
159463176X|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read. His first two books were excellent and that is why I bought And the Mountains Echoed. I will not spent another dollar on future books he is going to write, sorry. I am so very disappointed-what a mess it was.

B0031RS42K|3.0|Nothing unusual. Quick read predictable plot. America wins always. Can skip it, unless you want to read every Dan Brown book
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is a great game where you upgrade and maintain your hero. Hacking and slashing your way to victory. Meanwhile picking up valuable items your vanquished enemies drop at your feet.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This movie is a Christmas classic and the visual of this film is fantastic.  Tom Hanks is amazing in every role and I appreciate his superb skill and the writing and directing of this film wins, thumbs up.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This was very easy to read and put into action. This year it will be my go to for birthday gifts. It really makes getting in touch with yourself and the universe as easy as using a cake mix to make a birthday cake.
0064471837|5.0|Never really liked to read.  In high school I had to read Harry Potter and I thought they were great, but when I moved onto College a friend gave me Sabriel to read.  I didn't really want to take the time, but I was sick and I read it.  As I graduated from high school to college, so did I graduate from Harry Potter to Sabriel.  I couldn't put it down, fantasy about necromancers, magic, a kingdom under duress, and how a non-magical world deals with it with either denial or belief and readiness.<br /><br />Good necromancers, bad necromancers, the walking shambling dead, a petrified hero, a caged anti-hero always trying to escape, a villain with a master plan, and a quest to save another and 2 kingdoms.  Very well written with teasers here and there that make you want to read on to find out what happened and what will happen.  Also one of the best things is the fact that it is also part of a series, so when you want more you have 2 more books after and a 3rd one coming soon.  Also book on tape too with a great collaboration with Tim Curry in one of its versions.
B009G41CG2|2.0|I enjoy Jackpot party slot game its challenging and the graphics are great.  I will recommend this game to family and friends.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great flick. Blu-ray is great and sound effects are incredible. Hoping Daniel Craig signs on for one more Bond film!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The best book I have ever read on heaven written by a professional in today's English.  It is believable due to its author's journey and knowledge of the mind.
0689853491|5.0|My 2 year old daughter loves this book - a fun quick read for before bedtime. Its a childhood favorite.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very mixed emotions on this book. Thought it would have more explanations. Overall, an excellent well written trilogy. Can't wait for the movies!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton Abbey is a delight to watch from the piano solo opening, until it closes.  The attention to detail, the character development is wonderful.  I certainly hope that all is well in the Crawley household after all this...
B00127RAJY|3.0|This work out wasn't for me. While I like the 20 min time for the workout,  I found Jillian too pushy and demanding for my taste.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|First of all idk why youtube doesnt work on my kindle fire hd. I got this to watch videos online. It is incredibly slow, freezes, and has to be opened  up in a seperate place from internet. I honestly just want to watch youtube. I did give it three stars because it download  videos fast and that part works.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I watched the show first and then quickly bought and read the book because I wanted more. I was delighted to find how different the book was from the show. Highly recommend!
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Love it, it like Black Sabbath never stopped playing.  The song writing is still as good as it was before and after 30 years apart they still sound the same.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|Really great story and one of the best of the series. I really liked the interwoven characters and how Mr. Baldacci uses the talents of the Camel Club in new ways.
B00506NRBS|5.0|I read countless books and articles on starting a business, identifying your passion. For the most part these books have left me feeling hopeless as my dreams seemed further away than ever. There were always too many steps to just getting started and so like others, I'm sure, I abandoned my dream until a later time when something would remind me of its dormant state.  This book, Anything You Want, read like a loved mentor taking me by the hand and showing me that I already have everything I need, to do what I want and do what will bring me happiness. That this book warmed my gut is an acknowledgment that Derek Sivers', a millionaire entrepreneur, words are truth. His ideas (business is not about money but about making dreams come true for others and for yourself; only answer the call for help; you don't need money to start helping people) are my own.  This book has become like a trusted friend, one I keep close by and one who continually encourages me not to give up but rather to keep trying. Thank you Derek Sivers for sharing your inspirational account of getting what you want out of life. I'll forever hear your claim of having enough when others aspire to have everything.
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|I have played this cd over and over again, and really enjoy listening.  The songs are very catchy and ring in my head.  Just wish that the song &#34;Home&#34; was on there, that is why I ordered it. :)
B00DULWFZE|4.0|This is a strange album indeed- more of the old, only aged. Much like a sub-par bottle of wine, you can enjoy it, but can't help feel that there is something better out there. That being said, there is nothing technically wrong with the album- it is well sung, with original material (a welcome relief) that works well for them. Not revolutionary, but far from a stinker.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|This was a fun read and I couldn't put it down. The concept that there's a plot of land near the White House overseen by multiple agencies and this mystery occurs under their very noses was really, really fun. I don't know if the location really has that issue but it set up a great no-man's  island where all of the members of this conspiracy converged. Once again the Camel Club ride(?) to the rescue but it's hard to tell who will survive up to the end. Great storytelling.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book keeps you on your toes.  It is sad to think about what happens in families and how events in life can so quickly alter your entire existence.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Now that u bought the best thermal paste there is, don't mess it up but applying it incorrectly.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Read it out of curiosity, not in to romantic novels, the ending was amongst the worse, basically it doesn't end and I imagine that you must read all three to find the conclusion of the story, which I have very little interest in doing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very awesome game, big fan of the movies and hope more games are made in the near future. Fun way to pass the time!
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I decided to read Wuthering Heights because I have been trying to catch up with classic reads.  The book is obviously well written but I was quite depressed even with a relatively happy outcome.
B00ACP3OOM|2.0|Received my Neptune on 11 Aug 2013. Proceeded to charge it to full power and load songs. Tested it on land and it worked fine.<br /><br />Hit the pool on 12 Aug 2013. Fitting the Neptune onto my goggles and swimming cap was fairly easy, and they stayed on. I swam the breaststroke, which meant that my head was out of the water a lot. Yes, the sound is a lot better underwater but personally speaking, I did not have an issue adapting to the alternating sound quality in and out of water. I was just pleased to be swimming with music, and still be able to hear what was going on around me so I don't crash into other swimmers and can hear who's coming up behind me.<br /><br />I did not however realise that the music could be heard by other swimmers underwater. Is that the case? My volume was at 20-25.<br /><br />While resting after 20 laps of a 50m pool which is only 1.8m at its deepest, the Neptune started to play by itself (I had paused/turned it off while resting)! It took a number of attempts before I could get the Neptune to stop. Less than an hour later, as I was on my way home, the Neptune again started to play by itself!! And once again, I had to press the pause/power button a number of times before it would stop. The Neptune appeared dead by then. Later the same night, when I tried to connect the Neptune to my PC, it could not be detected. I tried a reset by pressing the back button under the pause/power button but it did not work either.<br /><br />I quickly contacted Finis' online support team which responded promptly, and after a little troubleshooting, I was told to raise a support ticket and proceed to request for an exchange. I also found out that I had to bear the shipping charges to return a *DEFECTIVE* item - Finis would only bear the charges to send a replacement set.<br /><br />Considering that I had paid $30 more for express shipping, and now have to bear further charges to return a *DEFECTIVE* item which died after just *ONE* use, I am obviously not happy. I am very disappointed that a product which had won an award for design otherwise scores so poorly in terms of quality and reliability. To be fair, what guarantee do I have that the replacement product won't be *DEFECTIVE* as well? I should not be subjected to a game of chance and have to pray that I would be one of the 'lucky' ones who receives a 'good' set.<br /><br />Looking at the other negative reviews here, I am taken aback that more is not being done for service recovery. Having to 'share' a cost for a problem which is *NO* fault of mine is really quite offensive.<br /><br />The Neptune is otherwise promising and I would have scored it 4 stars, but for the lack of quality and reliability, and poor service recovery. What a pity.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|As with the other Mahjong....  What can I say.  My mind isn't getting younger and I enjoy anything that keeps it active and alert.  Yes, watching girls on the beach would do this too, but this one doesn't get me smacked in the head by my wife.  Besides, I can do this while everyone else is watching the Disney Channel.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love the fact that I can keep up with my Facebook page on my Kindle Fire HD, but I am really disappointed that I can't play my Facebook games.  That really bites!!  Can't something be done about this problem? I know I'm not the only one requesting this. I have seen other comments.
B00D6C0D42|4.0|This film still holds up - the sets are amazing and still look creepily futuristic after all these years. You'll be humming &#34;Brazzzzill...&#34; all the next day.
B00008438V|5.0|This movie is the original with the original music.  Great show, would recommend it, very funny.  Young boys would love it, and men would remember what it was like to be 15 again.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I am probably not the right person to rate this.  I don't like to use portable devices for internet use as I don't have anti-virus programs for them and don't want to risk losing information.  Wrong generation, sorry.
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|There is a certain sense of pride, which I awaken within, each time a favorite artist steps up in his game. There is a certain sense of nostalgia, which overtakes, when I look back at the earlier memories of discovering a d&eacute;but of the then unknown name. Here it is, the very first vinyl pressing, of the album I cherish. Here he is, playing the piano on a video, or speaking for the very first time. Here he is, in front of me, shaking my hand after a performance, a musician which I've watched (and heard) slowly grow over the last five years. Here comes his first film score, his first collaboration, his first tour. I feel like I'm living these memories through him, vicariously, empathetic. I feel like his conquests are my feats, his sorrow my pain, his music my soul's song.<br /><br />The protagonist in this story is none other than &Oacute;lafur Arnalds, an Icelandic multi-instrumentalist who I've been following since 2007. With multiple past releases on the independent Erased Tapes Records, this year Arnalds gets picked up by the much bigger label, Mercury Classics, which has been launched in April of 2012 by Universal Music. With this move, Arnalds lands a support of a powerhouse, representing contemporary classical artists such as Andreas Ottensamer, Yundi, Milos and even Tori Amos. As such, his third solo album, For Now I Am Winter, is backed by an international campaign, global tour, and a full orchestral arrangement by Nico Muhly performed by The Icelandic Symphony Orchestra. Also, for the first time ever, the music features vocals by Icelandic singer Arn&oacute;r Dan Arnarson (member of the Icelandic band Agent Fresco), taking on a more commercial appeal. The latter I intend to mention with a positive note, as with such reinforcement Arnalds receives an even wider audience, which, after all, has always been the point of this story.<br /><br />On the album we still find pensive piano keys, gentle atmospherics, sparse electronic treatments, and gorgeous soaring strings. This time, however, the instrumentation feels grander, like a soundtrack to the film of Arnalds' tale. This metaphor is hardly surprising, since &Oacute;lafur has recently scored Broadchurch, a British television crime drama, which Mercury Classics has released as well. The pieces still carry sentimental elements, perhaps for something lost, perhaps for new beginnings, perhaps for simpler times of music in a living room. The title track introduces the first appearance of Arnarson's voice, slightly falsetto, slightly crestfallen, slightly forlorn. My mind skips up on the content of the lyrics and instead holds on to the melodies and chords. And these are ever and eternally sublime.<br /><br />\\"My music tends to be quite melancholic and dark, but I always try to never leave a song without a sense of hope. There's always light after the darkness. Incorporating vocals and especially the lyrics [...] was a challenge for me. Being an instrumental artist, there's this thing that I really like about the music being open to interpretation. There was a big challenge to balance [the lyrics] and not tell people too much, so we tried to treat the vocal as just another instrument.\\"<br /><br />Performing at many sold out concerts, Arnalds is slowly but surely getting the recognition he always deserved. Which, as I mentioned at the start of this article, is where that certain sense of pride comes from. I feel like I've been there all along, and now, after numerous listens of For Now I Am Winter, I'm happy I came for this ride. To traverse his journey, I put on Eulogy For Evolution (2007), I play through Variations of Static (2008), I drown in Another Happy Day (2012), and I suggest you do the same. All feel like small and carefully placed steps for the larger leap which is still yet to come. And I can't wait to bask in all the glory. Make sure you try and catch &Oacute;lafur's live show at the upcoming 10th Annual Decibel Festival [you know I'll be there!] taking place in Seattle on September 25-29, 2013 [Arnalds is playing on the 27th, at Optical 2 with Peter Broderick]. He is also performing in New York on October 8th, at Le Poisson Rouge! And don't forget to check out Broadchurch!9, 2013 [Arnalds is playing on the 27th, at Optical 2 with Peter Broderick].

B001GKJ2DY|4.0|I don't usually buy DVDs. But this one I had to have because of the music and the price. I ordered the widescreen version by mistake, not realizing there were different versions. I'm going to order the full screen and sell this one. I advise everyone to double check the version of the DVD to be sure it's the screen size you want.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I'm still reading this book and it is interesting to me because of the time period and I like the way Ken Follett writes.  It is obviously well researched and reads easily but the characters in this one just haven't grabbed me.  I preferred &#34;Winds of War&#34; and &#34;War and Remembrance&#34;  over the first two novels of this trilogy.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Once again, something I downloaded thinking it would be a great idea, only to discover that I also had to download my email info, then being to paranoid about potential virus' to do it.  I'm certain it would be great for someone more computer savvy than I am.
0812550706|5.0|Great depiction of characters. This book probes into important and sometimes disturbing questions. The characters are admirable and one immediately feels admiration and empathy for Ender.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love these books!! Could not put them down! I would recommend them to everyone!!! Great buy to!  All 3 books for less than $20 on my kindle!!
B000IZ8DZQ|5.0|08-11-13 Great movie, cast, direction... Ex-cons committing a heist w/out guns, w/out innocent by-standers being slaughtered or blown-up- fantastic!... If only movies today could be like this...
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|What can I say here?  It is one of the best pdf readers around.  Handy to have when you need it and like all other tools takes up space when you don't.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I got better than halfway through before throwing in the towel.  The combination of the annoyingly terse sentence structure, Americans using British colloquialisms, and totally two-dimensional, cardboard characters were enough to convince me to stop reading.  In addition, I'm from Georgia an I cannot express just how ridiculous the setting described here is.  I'm told that other Jack Reacher books are better.  I'm afraid I'll never know.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is pretty fun. I am a mystery buff, so I enjoyed playing it. The graphics were good. I like the fact that you can replay in an advanced mode for a different twist.
B005ZOCF5E|4.0|No fantasy here.  This hard science fiction with no apologies.  I felt the stry slowed as it got bogged down in minutia but quickly reverted to excitement as the story progressed.  Very inventive with new technology and its effects on human society.
B004GYY714|3.0|Another spontaneous decision that I regretted.  Just don't want to run down portable device batteries when I can use plug in devices.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game to play but you will lose track of time. Not sure if I'm going to purchase whole game yet or not.
B005544V6A|5.0|I started watching Suits as a replacement for those boring summer reruns and I absolutely love it!!! Not just the two guys, but every cast member. The show is character driven rather than plot driven, and the characters are strong. I love seeing Toronto sub for New York. I'd like to go there and get a bagel from the cart outside their office building!!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|As I finish each chapter I say &#34;I can't believe that just happened&#34;,this is really a great read although really long.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Another mind-numbing game for the kids during short around town trips.  Not overly fascinating if you can read above a fifth grade level and like books over redundancy.
B008220D5K|5.0|I thought the shipping time was really fast and I did not have to wait weeks for the movie. I bought it because I have seen it and really liked the story line and characters. I would absolutely use this seller again. Thank you for the movie.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I started watching Suits this summer as a replacement for the summer reruns that are so dull and boring. I love this character driven series. I used to watch Stephen Macht--Gabriel's father--in mini series years back. Gabriel is even better than his dad, and I loved his dad. All the series regulars are strong characters and move the storylines along. Tension is always present.Plots are not as convoluted as in some legal shows and are easy to follow. I enjoy all the Canadian actors that populate our TV screens. Most of all, I love seeing the Toronto setting, even though it is supposed to be New York. Toronto is beautiful. Makes me want to go there and get a bagel from the cart outside their office building!!!!!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|No long drawn out critique here. Good flow. Pretty well acted. Nice twist on the ending. Awesome audio and visual effects. About three different plots rehashed into one. Probably wont buy it but don't regret renting it. I enjoyed it overall.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|I started watching Homeland out of curiosity over Damian Lewis. I had seen him in the Forsythe Saga and hated his character; thus I hated him. I hadn't seen him in anything else, so it was just curiosity over the actor that had me fire up my Kindle Fire and watch Homeland. WOW!!!! Was I ever surprised. I think Damian Lewis is one of the finest actors on the screen today. And Clair Danes is simply magnificent. She has never been better. The supporting cast, especially Mandy Patinkin, is great. But then Mandy has never been less than great. Every episode keeps me spellbound from start to finish and gives me pause to consider our governments role in the war on terror. Homeland is for thinking people.

B00AK77WPE|2.0|The packaging we used to send all 5 CDS / DVDS by mail, was not correct and broke the 5 boxes, I think for this type of shipment, have to pack them in a cardboard box.<br /><br />The music, songs and videos of Juan Luis Guerra are excellent
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I am a BIG Lecter fan and was very skeptical of this when I heard NBC was doing it. But I was also somewhat excited. I have to say that, short of NBC getting Hopkins to play Hannibal, I think the series is as good as it could be. Well done NBC! Can't wait for season 2!
0061906220|5.0|Beautiful bold pictures and sparse but intentional wording teaches toddlers (and adults) that life is all good, if only we change our perspectives.  I bought this (and the stuffed toy) for my very sensitive and somewhat melancholy great-nephew.  He loves it as much as I do.

B00E9ZATJO|4.0|Monsters University, the sequel/prequel to 2001's highly popular Monsters, Inc., is entertaining and fast-paced enough to keep you from being bored. The problem is that you won't be surprised either. It's probably a film more to be enjoyed by kids who haven't seen all of the movies that MU draws - heavily - on and who aren't familiar with the well-used formulas that seem to make up most of what passes for plot. Don't get me wrong. MU isn't bad by any means. It does entertain and it does provide some interesting background for the characters - mainly \\"Sully\\" Sullivan and Mike Wazowski, but also their nemesis-to-be, Randy Boggs - that we remember from Monsters, Inc., and introduces some new characters as well. The only problem is that we've seen it all before and so nothing really surprises.<br /><br />The plot of MU is how Mike and Sully (voiced perfectly once again by the inimitable Billy Crystal and John Goodman) first came to meet before they went to work for Monsters, Inc. The film begins with a very young Mike going on a school field trip to Monsters, Inc. Wanting to see everything - which is hard when you're the shortest guy in the class - Mike ends up getting an unexpected experience of seeing close up what it's like to be a Scarer. And is immediately hooked, knowing what he wants to do in life. And where he has to go in order to learn how to do it: Monsters University.<br /><br />Things flash-forward a few years when Mike first sets foot in the hallowed halls of MU, where he meets - and quickly becomes rivals with - James \\"Sully\\" Sullivan, already something of a celebrity as he comes from a long line of famous scarers. They are the classic odd couple. Mike is manic, nerdy and a control-freak, while Sully is the MU equivalent of a legacy/jock: laid-back, over-confident and content to coast on his reputation. How they go from being bitter rivals who can't stand each other to being an inseparable team is the rest of the movie.<br /><br />It all flows well enough, but time and again I found myself realizing that I'd seen it all before, many times. Mike's life-forming childhood experience was drawn from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The fraternity parts were drawn from Revenge of the Nerds. Sully and Mike's odd-couple bickering-to-bonding plot was a well-worn formula from any number of buddy movies. Even the best new character, the highly intimidating Dean Hardscrabble (imperiously voiced by the equally inimitable Helen Mirren), was strongly derivative, down to the expression and even body language, of the Grand Councilwoman from Lilo & Stitch. About the most original thing in MU was how Randy (voiced once again by Steve Buscemi) was taken from actually being a meek bespectacled nice-guy anxious to make friends and turned into the vicious underhanded nemesis Mike and Sully had to contend with in Monsters, Inc.<br /><br />Part of the reason why Monsters University fails to reach the level of Monsters, Inc. is almost certainly due to the differences in the creative forces behind them. MI was directed by Pete Docter (who also directed the marvelous Up and the funny short Mike's New Car and wrote not only MI but also Toy Story, Toy Story 2, WALL-E and Up). MU on the other hand was directed by Dan Scanlon and was apparently his first feature film.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who liked Monsters, Inc. in particular and for anyone who likes well-done animation in general. Just don't expect it to be as original as the original., but time and again I found myself realizing that I'd seen it all before, many times.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a very well made movie, very touching and cute and goes to show even bad guys have hearts.
B005HSL626|5.0|slice up some fruit, score up some points.<br /><br />watch out for the many different bombs, though. one wrong move, and they explode.<br /><br />three different way to play, and it's fun. the more points you score, the better upgrades you earn. get this app, and slice up some fun.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|It wasn't that good wish I bought something else so I'm going to regret buying this and it was long and boring

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|my friend, Sherryl, has a thing for a game called Bejeweled. this game may not be that, but at least the diamonds in this game are shinny.<br /><br />match sets of 3 gems, or more, and score high points. if you keep it up, without breaking the chain, you get some sort of a fire effect. what that's for, I don't know, but it's probably to increase more points.<br /><br />anywho. this game is one interesting diamond in the rough. try it, and see how impressed you might be. cause you might be surprised.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Great game. Absolutely no problems with it. Can't believe it was free. I would have paid for it. Perfect game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series, i give it a 10+. The characters are wonderful, the acting is superb, not only in season 3 but in all three seasons. Cannot wait until season 4 in January.
1119962846|4.0|A friendly introduction to R, easy to understand, I put 4 because you would need some knowledge from the beginning to take the most out of it, but is approachable even to start from zero.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Pop a pattern of round bubbles, and help set free some Baby Kittens that have been imprisoned.<br /><br />As described in the title (or whatever it's suppose to be), this game plays like the Facebook Game, Bubble Safari. the only difference is it's played with a Cat instead of a monkey. despite being a bit similar, this game's pretty fun.
B00631VJIC|5.0|music is great. love the cd. did not realize that Segal did some of the singing. love all the songs
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|8-11-13  This was an Amazon Daily Deal.  It was a terrific value.  I once bought a &#34;complete set&#34; of this TV series on DVD from Amazon.com.  The discs turned out to be bootlegged copies and 3/4 of them didn't play.  I love buying this kind of thing from Amazon because they will make it right if there is a problem.  I let my husband have THIS set early, before my 30 day return ran out so he could make sure all the discs played.  They are AMAZING! The shipper packaged them well and they arrived on time and in perfect shape.

B00985E3UG|4.0|The insights given into the business of processed food are awe inspiring from a management perspective and terrifying from a consumer perspective.  A must read if you are responsible for feeding children.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|To much dealing with points and inside purchasing.  Can't play without buying or waiting for&quot;free&quot; points.  Just want to play the game.....
B001BR7CZW|5.0|My husband has this on DVD but not on Blu-ray.  I was surprised at how many scenes were clearer even though this is not an animated movie or one with a lot of special effects.  My husband sat down and watched it as soon as I gave it to him.  It arrived so early that I was able to give it as a birthday gift!
0345525558|5.0|I felt like the characters in this book were so well developed and the story was so real, I found myself laughing and crying at different times
0061148512|4.0|It is a bit hard to read, but it is interesting in the end. This book has many themes, and the themes are for you to find out.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend because he's just starting to get into video games and I wanted something that wouldn't be too brutal on him and also wouldn't insult his intelligence. This game was perfect!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great version. Love to play the winning deal so there's always a solution. If I miss a play and don't win, I can go back and just federal the same game and try a different path to solve.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I love Nicholas Spark books and films and this film was good but not great. I did not like the pairing of these two actors. I like them individually but didn't see the sparks or chemistry between the 2 that's needed in a romantic drama. However, it is still worth seeing, but it's not like Dear John or The Notebook. Truthfully, can any romantic drama top The Notebook? I doubt it.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Just the way it is supposed to have begun. MacGyver Season 1 is an excellent way to get to know the series! Definitely recommend, if you haven't seen it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Sweet,sad, and with an underlying bit of philosophy.  You don't have to love dogs to enjoy the story but  it helps.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I don't think the author has a real grasp of the &#34;sandwich generation&#34; when the parents are the wife's. She's stuck.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|They have such an original sound, I always worry rather i will like their newest work. They keep coming through though. I enjoy every song on the album, and can listen to it over and over.
B001P06GX4|4.0|This is the classic game that families with children of 5 or above can play together. It is fun.  The game pieces are a little flimsy but it is ok
B005HSL626|4.0|I really like this game it is great for all ages. I really like that it is not boring and very fun. The only problem with it is that for me adds pop up after every round.
B00AC8ZIXO|1.0|The high-mark reviews on this are likely from fans of Sci-Fi channel garbage; it is low budget, terribly acted, zero storyline fanfic idiocy.<br /><br />The characters are shallow and unbelievable, the overacting is flatulent in its pomposity and the script is laughable.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.
B003AKLFAG|5.0|Oldboy is definitely one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen, but it is also one of the best. It has plot twists (although they aren't totally impossible to guess for astute viewers), weird and morbidly interesting characters, and scenes that are shocking and emotional... moreso than any other movie I have seen so far in my life.<br /><br />The first thing to address is the disturbing part. It is a recurring theme in the 1-star ratings of this movie. Before you watch any movie, it's best to read the synopsis and some of the reviews that don't contain spoilers. Obviously, you should know some things about the movie (whether it has violence, gore, sexual scenes, drugs, scientific or psychological themes) before you even decide to watch it. If you can't handle blood or violence, this movie is not for you. If you can't handle sex scenes, this movie is not for you. If you can't handle disturbing subject matter, this movie is not for you. Basically, if you watch movies under a similar genre to psychological thrillers, it will most likely appeal to you. If it's your first time into psychological thrillers (especially Korean ones), there are milder ones you can watch first. People shouldn't be bashing a movie just because they feel uncomfortable with the themes in it. Lastly, I thought the ending was fairly straightforward though it seems some people think otherwise.<br /><br />Another thing I admired about the movie was its characters. They stuck to their character throughout the movie. There was never a moment of uncharacteristic behavior. Oh Dae-su is supposed to be kind of dumb. That is obvious at the very beginning by the fact that he got drunk and acted like a moron on his daughter's birthday and subsequently, his actions adhere to his personality. It explains some of his more foolish decisions in the movie, such as who he trusts and his reasons for doing so. The villain is supposed to be hypocritical. It could be that he wants to blame and punish someone else for what happened to him. It's a pretty normal response for people when they don't want to admit they were wrong. His actions could also have something to do with losing face in a big way. It doesn't matter that what happened to him was a product of his conscious actions. Ultimately, it was someone else that caused him to lose face.<br /><br />Finally, the scenes in this movie were amazing. This is one of the first movies I've seen that doesn't use martial arts or especially fancy fighting styles to make a fight scene. It uses raw power and endurance. Another cool thing about the fighting is that you can see everyone involved getting tired. It seems like a small detail, but when you think about it, most other movies don't accurately portray the limits to a normal person's endurance. The people fighting the protagonist in most fight scenes are either nobodies swept aside like nothing by the hero or the hero is shown with just a sheen of sweat on his body and a little heavy breathing... really? Oldboy's fight scenes are much more realistic. Another thing I found interesting about this movie was the consistent references to the time elapsed during Oh Dae-su's imprisonment. There are tons of things that pass people by if they are outside of society for 15 years. This movie is consistent about his ignorance to the world around him after he is released. But more than anything else, the dramatic scenes in this movie are strangely fascinating. He does crazy and unbelievable things that some people said were \\"cheesy\\" or \\"soap opera like\\", but I have to disagree. They are weird and kind of awkward sometimes, but also very disturbing and heart-wrenching. Seeing someone eat a live octopus, for example, is not \\"soap opera like\\".<br /><br />There is much more I could say about this movie, but I would just be repeating what other reviewers have already said.lse for what happened to him.

B0017SWPXY|3.0|I enjoyed the book for what it was, but found that some of the writing and the plot progression was over-simplified as it might be in a book for tweens.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Well written and easily understandable book about the man that became Jesus Christ. This is definitely a must read for someone with an open mind and ready understand the intubation that might have prevailed in Judea during the time of Jesus the Man. All in all a riveting book
140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan, has a well rounded narrative which is a summary of his own Academic Research. This Book highlights the geopolitical and social changes in the environment, which led to the rise and eventual crucification of Jesus.<br />While much of the context is explained, with a logical sequence what would be interesting to see, is more of matter related to the Political forces and the hypothesis behind the creation of the religion. Would encourage Researchers to shed more light in this Area.
B005HSL626|4.0|I really like this game, but sometimes when I hit a bomb it completely shuts down the app. I mean you would expect that out of a free app LOLZ:) I like playing this app when I am stretching. I stretch for 2 hours minimum everyday and it gets boring when I am like sitting there in the splits so I play a quick round of this game, definitely makes it more entertaining.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I haven't seen the movie but from speaking to people who have, the book bears little resemblance to the movie.<br /><br />A well ordered read, logical and progressive narrative. I enjoyed it very much and found it hard to put down.
B00E193TM2|5.0|I was waiting for this CD for quite a long time, so I may be a little biased.  If you're a knuckledhead, this is a must have.  If you are just shopping around for some great rock, give 5FDP a listen.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I read it all at once...the writing is beautiful and the writing within the writing is beautiful. I wished I could read An Imperial Affliction, but then I thought maybe I was. At one point I was convinced this book would stop mid sentence. The characters are interesting in that they are both young and old at the same time, they possess a maturity that I suppose is a result of coming to terms with your mortality, but they are still teenagers - rash decision makers, tantrum throwers and true love believers. I reached the end without knowing it was the end. I suppose I could have followed the lives of the characters forever...just to see how it plays out...<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it was a little fairy tale for me. A little too perfect, sort of romantic comedy feel at one point. But that is no fault of the story or the writer, simply a personal taste issue. Also I suppose it was pretty predictable, but I suppose, in the end, all stories are predictable.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A great zombie read in between seasons of Walking Dead.  Very little connective tissue between the book and movie.  In hindsight, the movie was a stand alone project, sharing only a title - - noting else.
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|I started competitive swimming to improve my triathlon swim times.  Unfortunately,I bought into the &#34;barely there kick&#34; theory, and never developed my swim kick.  The snorkel has helped me become a stronger kicker, which has dramatically improved my swim times!
B00CW665VI|3.0|This was the first book I've read by Emma Chase so I didn't know what to expect. The characters were okay, but I wasn't clamoring to find out what happens next. I don't know why, but I just couldn't connect with the book. Overall the book was okay, and I would probably read the next one in the series but I won't be rushing to download it.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Constant updates that don't appear to be very well thought out and the fact that this game freezes so much make Bingo Blitz too challenging to truly enjoy anymore.  I just checked out Spambook.com and BB has a number of complaints from users who have lost $$$ playing the game.  Their last update (forced by the developers) won't install on my andriod device because of a &#34;parse&#34; error.  That means the last update (for Kindle Fire) isn't compatible with other devices.  You would think the developers could have figured this out ahead of time but in the constant push for more money from users, they seem to not take the time to do any testing of their own.<br /><br />It's really too bad.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|It's ok it's just that u can't have friends unless it on Facebook which is the only reason y I don't like it
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Ok I must admit I was a bit confused on exactly which box set of Battlestar Galactica Complete Series Blu-ray to purchase. One of the reviews I read mentioned that the silver box set included Razor (in the same case as season 4) and The Plan (also mentioned as being in the same case as season 4).  I purchased the silver box set with the Blu-ray stripe around the top and it just arrived today. I opened it right away to make sure everything I thought was included was, in fact, there. Yep. Here is what I found and I hope it helps someone else who is a bit confused on what to purchase.<br /><br />My box set, again in the silver box NOT THE BLACK BOX, had Razor included as a separate Blu-ray disk and was found in the season 4 case.  The Plan was included in a separate case all by itself.  So everything was there but whomever packages this series has changed it up a bit again as, in my set, The Plan was not included in the season 4 case.  But The Plan was there albeit in a case by itself.<br /><br />I have not started my Battlestar Galactica marathon yet so I cannot comment on the quality of the picture and/or sound. But since it's Blu-ray I'm expecting it to be up to Blu-ray typical standards.<br /><br />In closing I will say that I must have purchased this when Amazon was having a special sale day because I paid only $89.99 for my Blu-ray series set. I had put this in my wish list back in the summer of 2012. Last week I logged into Amazon in order to purchase some other items and I saw the tremendous drop in the price so I ordered this right away.  I noticed today in writing this review that the price for this Blu-ray series set is back up to $178.99.  If you want this set, and are willing to wait a while like I did, you may want to put this item in your wish list and keep a daily eye on the pricing.
B0031KE9C6|5.0|This was a great series and to watch it again and see all the guests stars that went on to a big career is great. no problems watching it the first or second time.

0060574216|4.0|The only problem is that I truly understand the book, but my husband still can't understand me.  I purchased a book for each of us.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game i could play it all day but it could really use an update where there are more vehicles and more tracks to add more variety and flavor to this game.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|it was a fun challenging puzzle game. the only problem I had is it was not long enough for me.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Here's an author who knows how to tug at your heart strings and make you feel for each character he introduces in this book, sprawling generations and continents. And The Mountains Echoed is beautifully written and if I have to describe it in one word, it is 'heartbreaking'.<br />He offers a range of emotions, from unconditional sibling love, guilt, unrequited love, loyalty and most importantly the pain of separation.<br />This is one author who understands human emotions really well and is able to make you feel and experience what his characters are going through. I highly recommend this book.
B005K17RU0|2.0|It was confusing to set up personal locations at first, and I really only used it to check the weather for the day or week, and for any trips out of town. I stopped using it for merely a few weeks, but it was already due for an update. When it finished, I had to keep putting in my locations. It constantly did that to the point where I used the app so infrequently it was too much effort and the updates took too long when all I wanted was to check weather.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|As always Justin is amazing!  Some of the songs are a bit longer than they need to be but still amazing.
B009GJBEF6|5.0|This was a great movie, I chose it because I not only like Pierce Brosnan, but 007 movies. Kept you on the edge of you seat.<br />Would recommend to anyone who likes James Bond movie's.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I was reading this book lazily with a few pages every day till I hit a point where I just couldn't keep it down. I finished more than half the book in one sitting as it involves you completely. You are in the head of the two main characters or they are in your head! It is a very well written thriller that doesn't fail to surprise you till the very end.
0316228532|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my daughter who is a JK Rowling fan.  Arrive new and on time.  She was happy.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|I have been a New Kid fan since the beginning and this album reminded me why I love them all so much!!!!  So excited to have them back.  Even my husband loves several of the songs!
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Fast action and another winner for Bruce. I have not been disappointed in any of the die hard movies. I wonder what the next movie will be like. I guess we will have a whole selection of the &#34;RED&#34; and now &#34;RED 2&#34; with Bruce. All are good and lively moving movies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I wish the game was longer, but it was great while it lasted. The game provides those genuine \\"aha\\" moments that are often absent in real life. Waiting for a sequel.
1455526959|5.0|Harry Bosch takes it upon himself to solve a murder from 20 years ago during the L.A. riots following the Rodney King verdict.  Very intriguing story line involving a foreign reporter (the victim) and a close-knit set of individuals who had been in the National Guard serving in Desert Storm and later as peace-keepers during the riots.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|A wonderful world war two spy novel.  Ken's ability to get your attention on the first page is in the writing as well. Loved it from the first page to the last.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My children and I have enjoyed playing this game.  Unlike, 100 Floors, these floors can be solved with some thinking.  I found myself always &quot;cheating&quot; when I played 100 Floors.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very challenging, really make you think. Also very addicting, find myself staying up way to late at night<br />Would recommend to everyone.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|i was a lucky one and got the unit within the first week of release.  For the price I couldn't pass it up just to try and out and play with it. Well truth be told we use this more than we use the Netflix app on the tv, or my Xbox. And it works so much better than using the menu on Comcast to rent movies. Google Play is so simple to use wit my tablet or phone, or laptop. My girlfriend can easily stream from her Iphone and while the movie is playing we can still make phone calls and use the phone for text messages etc<br /><br />using this device to play music streamed through my home stereo works so much better than using Bluetooth also, I don't have to worry about being too far away.  I can't wait to get 2 more devices for the other tv's around the house.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The kind you look forward to getting back to.  Seems there aren't too many like that.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Pleasant short read with some signature King moments of discomfort. Did not like the ending, but will give no spoilers...

0449014509|5.0|This is book three in Rick Riordan's second series about the Greek demigods and also includes Roman demigods as well. For those who loved the Percy Jackson books his second series is just as great and the third book does not disappoint. Book 1 The Lost Hero  introduces new Heroes. It also includes Annabeth and mentions Percy Jackson. The second book is about Percy Jackson at  the Roman camp. Book 3 Mark of Athena joins the heroes in book 1 and book 2 and together they go on a quest. The books are great for kids, teens and adults. I love them as much as my kids do. My son who is ten owns all the audio books and listens to them while cleaning his room, doing his chores, and on long car rides. He loves the books so much he listens to them over and over. We are anxiously awaiting book 4 Son of Hades.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|my favorite actor is the phantom, because of his singing, and the very best actor for this role, always and forever.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a must read!!! Beautifully written, and chemistry between the main characters makes this a page turner! The storyline is one that will move you to tears. Colleen Hoover does a fantastic job with this one!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it was the perfect combination of action and romance. It was not overly done on either end
B005544TRQ|4.0|This is a really intense series. Lots of controversy and egos among the characters. Many perplexing complex problems to solve.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great if you are a fan of temple run. It adds a lot of new items and is great when you are bored. I highly suggest you get this game.
1476733953|5.0|I read Wool because a friend told his Facebook followers we really had to find it and read it.  I trusted his judgment and gave it a try.  Can I just say that the only thing I didn't like about Wool is the fact that I began it on a Hawaiian vacation.  I HATED putting this book down to enjoy Hawaii, and yet, in part because of the issues faced by the people in Wool, I did enjoy my Hawaiian vacation anyway!<br /><br />I'm not a sci-fi reader usually, but this felt so different from sci-fi anyway.  It felt like just fiction, and yet--frighteningly--so true too.  You'll read just a little and then go \\"wow\\".  Then you'll read a little more and you'll say, \\"holy crap\\".  Then you'll keep reading and find yourself saying both of these phrases and more.  You'll have trouble putting the book down.  You'll stay up later each night than you intended to.  By the end, you'll be ready to throw the book across the room.  Please don't.  Cherish it.  Enjoy it.  Then immediately move on to his other Wool books.<br /><br />Jealous of you if you haven't read it yet.  Seriously, buy it now and thank me later!!!  Enjoy!!!
1594746036|4.0|In Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs, Jacob Portman is a teen in search of himself. Oh, he knows he's the only son in a wealthy family with a future in the family drugstore chain, but, as he shared with his grandfather, he wants a less mundane life full of adventure. Jacob's grandfather had shared stories of his own childhood when he was a war orphan at a strange home for peculiar children with special abilities, but then, his grandfather also worried about the monsters so Jacob thought it was all just a fantasy.<br /><br />\\"I felt even more cheated when I realized that most of Grandpa Portman's best stories couldn't possibly be true. The tallest tales were always about his childhood, like how he was born in Poland but at twelve had been shipped off to a children's home in Wales.\\" (Page 9)<br />More fantastic still were his stories about life in the Welsh children's home. It was an enchanted place, he said, designed to keep kids safe from the monsters, on an island where the sun shined every day and nobody ever got sick or died. Everyone lived together in a big house that was protected by a wise old bird--or so the story went. As I got older, though, I began to have doubts.\\"<br />(Page 9)<br /><br />And I really did believe him--for a few years, at least--though mostly because I wanted to, like other kids my age wanted to believe in Santa Claus. We cling to our fairy tales until the price for believing them becomes too high, which for me was the day in second grade when Robbie Jensen pantsed me at lunch in front of a table of girls and announced that I believed in fairies. It was just deserts, I suppose, for repeating my grandfather's stories at school but in those humiliating seconds I foresaw the moniker \\"fairy boy\\" trailing me for years and, rightly or not, I resented him for it. (Page 16)<br /><br />It wasn't until a few years later that my dad explained it to me: Grandpa had told him some of the same stories when he was a kid, and they weren't lies, exactly, but exaggerated versions of the truth--because the story of Grandpa Portman's childhood wasn't a fairy tale at all. It was a horror story. (Page 17)<br /><br />When his grandfather is murdered under suspicious circumstances he gives his last instructions to Jacob:<br /><br />I asked him what happened, what animal had hurt him, but he wasn't listening. \\"Go to the island,\\" he repeated. \\"You'll be safe there. Promise me.\\"<br />\\"I will. I promise.\\" What else could I say?<br />\\"I thought I could protect you,\\" he said. \\"I should've told you a long time ago ...\\" I could see the life going out of him.<br />\\"Told me what?\\" I said, choking back tears.<br /> \\"There's no time,\\" he whispered. Then he raised his head off the ground, trembling with the effort, and breathed into my ear: \\"Find the bird. In the loop. On the other side of the old man's grave. September third, 1940.\\" I nodded, but he could see that I didn't understand. With his last bit of strength, he added, \\"Emerson--the letter. Tell them what happened, Yakob.\\" (Page 33)<br /><br />Jacob has nightmares about his grandfather's death and ends up traveling, with his father, to the island his grandfather had talked about for years and spoke of in his dying breath.<br />I thought mom would object--three whole weeks!--but the closer our trip got, the more excited for us she seemed. \\"My two men,\\" she would say, beaming, \\"off on a big adventure!\\" I found her enthusiasm kind of touching, actually--until the afternoon I overheard her talking on the phone to a friend, venting about how relieved she'd be to \\"have her life back\\" for three weeks and not have \\"two needy children to worry about.\\"<br />Page 63<br /><br />And that is how someone who is unusually susceptible to nightmares, night terrors, the Creeps, the Willies, and Seeing Things That Aren't Really There talks himself into making one last trip to the abandoned, almost-certainly-haunted house where a dozen or more children met their untimely end.(Page 99)<br /><br />Ransom Riggs has throughout the books old photographs to illustrate the story, which is what made Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children create such a buzz when it was initially released. It's a unique concept and the photos add a delightful creepiness to the story, however this is more a mystery/fantasy rather than a horror novel. Actually, it becomes a genre-bending novel in the second half. There are some plot holes, especially in the second part of the novel, when he's on the island.<br /><br />Viewing the photos might bother some people if you're reading this as an eBook. If desired, you can look online to see the photos larger/clearer. It didn't really bother me on the Kindle. (Actually this has bothered me more with nonfiction books.)<br /><br />The narrative actually started out stronger than it finished, but all in all I'd highly recommend it. There is a sequel, Hollow City.<br /><br />Other Quotes:<br />\\"I didn't know you could fry toast,\\" I remarked, to which Kev replied that there wasn't a food he was aware of that couldn't be improved by frying. (Page 72)<br />\\"When someone won't let you in, eventually you stop knocking. Know what I mean?\\" (Page 84)(Page 99)<br /><br />Ransom Riggs has throughout the books old photographs to illustrate the story, which is what made Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children create such a buzz when it was initially released.

B002X3V4P2|5.0|No problems with the mp3 download.  Would like for the album to keep playing when I shuffle but it doesn't.  Bummer!
B00BSZZA3I|4.0|This case looks great and protects my phone well.  No major drops yet, so can't report on that, but it protects against keys, etc in my bag/purse.  I love the stand feature, I just wish the HTC android build made more use of the landscape rotation!  So far it has been worth the extra money.  Fits securely and is easily removable.<br /><br />My drawbacks: I have a universal car charger that also serves as a hands free display.  When in the case, the adjustable cradle for the phone doesn't fit well, so I have to take it out of the case when driving.
B004UPANAI|5.0|I've seen this movie before but I wanted to own it and I found it for a great price on amazon. It's a great movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Have watched all the seasons of Downton Abbey. Love them all. Can't wait for season 4 to see how the story line goes

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If u saw the movie of this game on or around 7/3/13. U will be saying  like those people are addicted to games. &quot;THIS game is MAGESTIC&quot; or shh leave me alone im trying to be a BOSS (I LOVE THIS  GAME)  :)
0375760024|5.0|Kind of written in an old manner but hey sherlock is old. It's a great book each tale is about 20 pages long so just read a tale a day and you won't get burned out and you'll finis in a month or so.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved loved loved this book I am going to read the rest of the series this author is amazing. I have read a lot of his books
B00CWY76CC|5.0|GREAT CHALLENGE AND VERY CLEVER. Love it! Even the music is elevator. Probably a cinch for more experienced game players.
B0041D843M|1.0|Suggested this book by Chinese / Herbal / Acupuncture treatment providers.  Started off informative but then just went on and on.  If you are really into Nutrition and Study may be of benefit.  Ended up skimming only
B0068THAGY|4.0|Being a child that grew up in the 70s, this movie brought back a lot of memories just because of the set design and costumes.<br />The story line was solid and I really enjoyed it.  I wish the cast had been a little more diverse.<br />Overall good movie.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book was deeply moving to me, and to many others. I appreciate that I was given a chance to read this book
B008B1BL4E|4.0|Extraordinarily well researched, with seemingly unbiased conclusions. One hopes that some lessons for today's world can be drawn from this analysis of a confused and conflicted past.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Really enjoy these &#34;cans&#34;, had a set of 'em years ago and feel confident this one will last me just as long.  SOLID buy!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I have sons, so I am aware of all types of comic book heroes.  The Avengers was a combination of the really popular ones.<br />It was action packed and surprisingly a good story line.  The Hulk is still my favorite!  Too bad there is no diversity among heroes....just Samuel.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A story everyone should read. The characters are beautifully drawn. Love, pathos, suspence, Reality at its best.A feeling for the country and the times.
B006PKV2QU|5.0|As a parent, an educator, and a writer myself, I can appreciate a good picture book. A lot of kids don't like to read and most of the time, it's because they and their parents can't find good books that entertain and engage. Too  many books for kids try to teach a lesson too obviously, to preach, to lecture. And who wants that? Definitely not a young kid. Kids learn by playing and imagining, and that's what they will do as they read \\"I Think It's a Rock\\" by Peter Collier.<br /><br />The book starts with a simple, easy-to-relate-to problem: a kid has something that feels like a rock in his shoe. Of course, he asks himself what it could be. At first, the answers are logical. Maybe, gum? Maybe, a bee? The line \\"That's what he thought, but maybe it's not\\" at the end of each of these pages will make the kids think about the possibilities. It will also create a desire to turn the page and find out, and that's what will keep them reading.<br /><br />With each turn of beautifully-illustrated pages, the answers get wilder and funnier until Mom has to interfere and bring a sense of reality to the situation that is quickly descending into an uncontrollable giggle-fest. She thinks it's just a rock. But the author is a kid at heart, so the last page of the book shows a picture of a mischievous little dragon-like creature, with just one line to finish the book, \\"...but maybe it's not,\\" leaving the kids to ponder all the wild and creative ideas presented in this book. Highly recommended!
B00CS74W0C|4.0|the writer captured a wonderful character in Eva.  She was realistic in her with holding of information from her dad and the concept of coming from a split family was dealt with well.  The intensity of the novel's was great and watching the on and off again relationship was good.  Steamy scenes and fun parties added to the plot.  Really enjoyed the murder issues too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging!!!!I do love a good challenge !Hopefully you get more rooms over soon. I will be looking forward to hearing from you !!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This program is much better now. Before the mapping was spotty and now it updates quicker and is clearer.<br /><br />Thomas
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I've been watching this show since the day it first aired. I'm so glad people are finally catching on! This show has amazing actors/ actresses (Donna Rocks!) and never disappoints. It's one of those shows you actually can't wait a week for.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This product did not address specific levels so it was of no use to me for the level I cannot pass through.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the first time that I have ever finished reading a book, actually the series and started all over again!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this is one of those games you don't always get on tablets so this is awesome has very good gameplay too!!
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Great, great, great CD.  Classic songs.  Numerous songs.  Love to work around the house, or just down and relax and enjoy these hits!  Recommend to anyone who loves the Bee Gees!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Heroism at its best. The liberals and their media just do not understand. Thankfully there are Marcus Luttrells and others like him out there.
B008I34YYY|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! It makes fun of everything across the board, and usually, there is something to offend everyone. A crazy take on the idea of the Nazis fleeing earth to the moon. I love this as much as The 5th Element. Nice style, and fun movie. Never gets old!
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie. I made a point of purchasing the product with a digital copy just so I could rewatch it easily on my iPad. Unfortunately whomever setup the Digital Copy flyer did a crappy job, not making it obvious that you have to choose between UltraViolet or Digital Copy.<br /><br />I will state for the record that I don't use UV and make a point of avoiding movies that only have the UV option. That said, I've still noticed that on some movies you have to activate the UltraViolet code before you're able to request the Digital Copy. Not so with this movie. If you activate the UltraViolet copy (which is at the top of the flyer), you prevent yourself being able to access the digital copy. ***** There is NOTHING on the flyer saying you have to make a choice between the two options. *****<br /><br />The only recourse you have to try resolve any digital issues is via Paramount's website. I've sent them two (2) requests one week apart via that method. I told them that the flyer didn't say anything about choosing between the two, that I didn't want it on UV, I wanted to have it in my iTune library so I could play it on my laptop & iPad, and they could delete it from my UV account. NO RESPONSE FROM PARAMOUNT at all. :(<br /><br />Needless to say I'm upset (understatement) because I really wanted to be able to play the movie on my iPad. AWESOME movie. Am actually hoping Tom Cruise makes more of these. HORRIBLE customer service from Paramount.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game was very entertaining. The hidden object scenes were thoroughly depicted. The puzzles were challenging. I wish more hidden object games were as good as this one. This game is a cut above the rest.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game. It is challenging and a little card to solve at times. Can't wait for the next room. Great sound affects. Good clues. Thanks for a great game!
0670026638|5.0|Buddhist Cosmology presented in a modern-day topical narrative.  Very readable and extremely enjoyable.  Fully annotated for reference to Buddhist and other sources.  Edifying. I'll never hear or use the phrase &#34;..for the time being&#34;  the same way again.
B00280LYIC|5.0|A great story for lovers of mythology, Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief is a book about two demigods, (children of gods and humans) Percy and Annabeth, and their protecting satyr, Grover, as they journey across the United States to look for Zeus' (the Greek god of lightning) master bolt which has been stolen. The Lightning Thief is the perfect bridge between a tween's book and mythology. (You know, the stuff that you thought was boring and are now like &#34;Oh my gods, I love this stuff!) The book is also good for teens who are interested in mythology and adults who want a good mythology book with a twist of interesting fiction. Percy Jackson has a good amount of emotional backstory (e.g. Thalia Grace's story) and the (not so) occasional joke that keeps the pages turning. I recommend this to anybody who's interested in mythology, be it child, tween, teen, adult, or even elderly. Oops, Chiron's coming, I don't need him to see me using my iPad. Bye!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I think this app is great, but the fact that you need Wi-Fi to download/start the game, and that it takes aprox 5 minutes to boot up the game and start playing makes the game really sucky. Other than that I think it is great.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|It is an okay game.  As in many of these games, you have to buy extra stuff in order to advance in the game quickly.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|A more mature sounding Paramore. A creative leap for them that's equally if not more enjoyable than before. If you're like me and  loved their sound before ..you'll definitely love them again.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I rarely get to read books set in Ireland and this one is so firmly set in the country. While some parts of the story were disturbing, overall, it is a book full of hope and there were many bits that made me smile.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Excellent Read Damian Stevenson!<br /><br />I read this instantly gripping page turner in one afternoon. The main character Dana on her way to Oklahoma to live with her sister Zoe seems scattered from the beginning of this fast paced thriller. Her boyfriend is missing from the Motel and there is no sign of him anywhere. She never gives up looking for him in this little community where her sister lives.<br />Everyone seem to live in complete harmony here, but there are strange things going on in this house and everyone seems a little to happy that Dana has come to live with them.<br />Thank-goodness she has her cat Alice.<br />There are plenty of mysterious happening going on all over Oklahoma and with the Solstice just days away who knows what sacrifices will have to be made.<br /><br />If your after a great non-stop action, page-turning book, I highly recommend reading Solstice and be careful what town you end up in. You never know what sacrifices you will have to make.
B0011Z1BSS|5.0|Take me back to good times.  This was the first album I bought when I was a kid. Awesome, great.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|This is an easy to use app that I'm learning to depend on.  I prefer to use it over going to Google Calendar in my laptop.  It's much easier to use.  Thanks.
B00C2IPBBQ|4.0|Very good compliant to Japanese Language and subtitle.<br />Of course good quality of vision and sound.<br />I recommend to Japanese users !<br />But delivery from US to Japan is so late (compare to AMAZON UK, from Euro to Japan).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is very addictive and a great game to pass time. It doesn't need internet connection so u can play it at anywhere at any time! I would recommend it to you! Enjoy this game!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|not a bad way to pass the time. fun and entertaining. good graphics and game flow. my kids love it.
B000050HTO|5.0|THE CD CAME ON TIME. THE MUSIC IS GREAT I LISTEN IN THE CAR ALL THE TIME IT BRINGS BACK ALL THE COLLEGE DAYS, IT HAS A LOT OF MEMORIES.
B00BPJ5Z96|3.0|Good contents. But Blu-ray case is so soft and weak...<br />This is 40th Anniversary edition, so I think that Warner have to release this edition with stronger and more gorgeous case  or steelbook case in same price !
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read, beautiful writing characters well filled out and plot good.A good look at Afghani life with sympathetic attitudes.Would read this book again
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Yep, definitely still crying.<br /><br />If you have any time at all, read this book. Put some perspective into your life. Life is beautiful. This book is beautiful and this author is a genius. The symbols, the metaphors, the love. I just can't even express the way this book unravels other than, you need to read it.<br /><br />Also, if you do not cry, you're a robot and heartless.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|This book rambles on for hundreds of pages before it gets to anything worth reading.  I could not even finish it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is so great for showing you everything you need. It shows music playback, how long you can browse the Internet, and SOO many other things. Perfect for a Kindle Fire
B009X2CVXA|4.0|A great book if one wants a book for a holiday read, I also liked the style of writing,it had a great plot and I was keen to keep reading, I would resommend it to a friend.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Friends and family had urged me to watch the three seasons of this show and now I know why.  Each show holds your attention and you are eager to see what happens next.<br />I enjoyed watching how the relationships in this family unfolded and intertwined with each other.  I was suprised to see that as aristcrats you might have expected them to feel above the servants that they employed, but they truly felt they were their friends and were fair in their treatment of any issues.<br />I can't wait for Season 4!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|a problem with the game is it freezes but biside that it is a great game and the most fun part is wen I'm mimicking minion buts
B001F4UHEE|5.0|Sam Mendes and his cast are genius in capturing every human emotion, as they explore contempt, desire, oppression, and more.  A must-see film that deserves the nominations and praise it was given in its time.
0062060554|5.0|This was a thriller, and well written. It was a difficult to put down read with twists and turns, despair and questions--worth losing sleep to read.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|This camera on the kindle is absolutely horrible!  I have not even been able to take a quality photo.  disappointed!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Ordered this for a present.  It's strange to me but good.  However, this will be the only Adele I'll buy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really nice virtual game to play and beneficial taking-care-of-your-horse games the only complaint I have is that buying another horse cost to much for me. Maybe there could be something where you can breed with a friend's horse
B001KL0WJW|4.0|It's a bit heavy with exposition, but overall a lot of fun to watch. A great glimpse of NYC in a grittier time.
B00DDZM0GQ|2.0|Just not my cup of tea. I like tower defense games. Okay for folks who like tetris type games but not for me.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|It was a nice way to wrap up the episodes that were produced for the series, while allowing for future possibilites with the universe.  I would still like to see a follow-on movie, even given the current successes of some of the actors (Fillion)...
0743435729|3.0|Given the amount of positive reviews Weber gets for his Harrington books, I assume this review won't be well received, but I just have to say it.<br /><br />Throughout the book (I chose the Audible edition), I kept asking myself whether this was intended for young adults rather than a more mature audience. I've been reading Sci Fi for a very long time, and this book, more than others, represents that which I tire of the most.<br /><br />First, the childish fascination with totalitarian governments as being chivalrous (which, I suppose they are, by definition).  A monarchy has little to differentiate itself from a dictatorship or autocracy, and even with the smattering of legislature presented in the text, it still belies a rather primitive approach to governance.  Am I to really believe that by the time humanity becomes an interstellar spacefaring race, that monarchy will be the best government that the \\"good guys\\" can come up with?<br /><br />Second, the rather pointless diversion in the form of the straw character who was the token peacenik.  The guy served as little more than a one dimensional whiner who by weak argument ends up supporting the author's clear belief that War is Wonderful, and that armed conflict should always be the first choice.  The peacenik could have been a more nuanced character, but instead we get a jawless caricature that serves no purpose other than a receptacle for the author's scorn for peaceful settlement.<br /><br />Of course, to do this, he has to paint people with religious zeal to be unidimensional nincompoops.  Understand, that I am not, nor have I ever been a religious person, yet I was offended by his treatment of religion.  The Graysons are portrayed as \\"more reasonable\\" simply on the basis of being less devout.<br /><br />Finally, one would be hard-pressed to find a fully three-dimensional characterization in the entire book.  Yes, we like all our protagonists to be staunch lantern-jawed butt-kickers, and Harrington's character certainly \\"racks-up\\" when things get tough.  I can forgive one all-too-perfect protagonist, perhaps, yet there wasn't an ounce of nuance in any of the supporting characters.<br /><br />This book is not at all unique in deserving these criticisms, but it does seem to be particularly effective at distilling those very properties that drive me up the wall.  And, it isn't really science fiction.  It's Horatio Hornblower with spaceships and kill-o-zap rayguns.  The author might better serve his readers by writing directly to that market instead of putting the veneer of space-age on what's otherwise a traditional swash-buckling genre.certainly \\"racks-up\\" when things get tough.

0143036556|5.0|This book covers so much of the materials that we see in the news today. It allows us to see what we could be doing to the environment of the world, as we continue our movement toward overpopulation that could cause our extinction.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|slow starter;picks up and moves fast;highly recommended;u will not be dissappointed if u like action and twisting plots;cant wait to continue the next series
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|For those of you that enjoyed Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, and also enjoy action/adventure, this is your movie.  It has multiple layers of meaning that anyone can enjoy.  I don't agree with the statement at the end, (I can't really discuss without spoilers), but regardless, I still enjoyed it tremendously.  The female heroine was a nice touch.  Good casting all around.  Nice seeing Jaime Lannister from GoT too for a small part.  He had a lot of gravitas and presence in the screen time he did have.  Overall: great movie.  Only wish I had bought it instead of spending $7 renting it in HD.  Ah well such is life.
B000AP04L0|5.0|I live this movie every day, that's why I think it's so funny. I even made a Halloween costume of Post-it man. I also have a red Swingline stapler at my desk....now if I could just unscrew the cubicle walls and knock them over so I have a view......
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this in connection with Muziq Library, however all of a sudden pop ups started appearing at the bottom of this app. This is the ONLY app this happens to. They include saying that my phone  (which I do not have internet on) is going to crash; that I have a virus that will cause my Kindle to quit working). I tool my Kindle to Best Buy and they installed anti virus software, so I am secure, but these pop ups are still appearing whenever I get into Tube Mate.  I was told to just ignore them, but it is hard to do when they constantly appear. Plus, DO NOT CLICK on them at any time. It could cause serious problems.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I liked the game a lot but I do wish it was a lol longer. It's hard but it's not to hard over all it is a good game
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|This version is a lot darker and more gory than the first . Don't be fooled into thinking its a comedic horror film
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It wasn't helpful at all w/ the level I was stuck on. I finally passed the level on my own.
B008602KQI|4.0|When the movie came out, I was not interesting in seeing it.  Now that I waited so long to watch it, I should have watched it sooner.  I think it was very entertaining.  I enjoyed watching the leading actress do her thing.  She was excellent in that role.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read especially for those who are new to the subject matter.  HOT book!  Am on my fourth time ready the trilogy.  Can't get enough and can't wait for the MOVIE !!!!

B00CPCERPA|5.0|Not sure if Guy Clark is capable of making an album I wont love. His lyrics are beautiful. Got the vinyl with free MP3 and it was WELL worth it :) Highly recommend this album for anyone who loves music.

B0098QBEXO|5.0|Makes you think about what is really important in life. Benedict is perfect in perfoance, class act all the way. A little hard to follow all the dialog with the background music. Could have done without it.
1416955070|4.0|I have not read much of this book yet, but when I do read it I'm mesmerized. The wording of it is fantastic and there is a great story line to it.  This book is definitely a must read and I plan on reading all of the books in the series!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book about a really serious subject but written in a way that is light and comical at times. Definitely recommend this!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading most of Ken Follett's novels.  This one flowed smoothly and the plot kept me engaged throughout the story.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|As with almost all Dan Brown novels, this was quite enjoyable and a great way to spend an afternoon or two...great premise and actually quite thought provoking, although the fun and excitement and twists and turns you would expect are still there...highly recommend...
B005LAIH2C|1.0|if you're into that type of thing then you will enjoy this film. I however, am not and did not.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book was an interesting read, but I only rated it 4 stars because it was not a plot that drew me in to the story.  I could put the book down and pick it up a few days later without any urgency to find out what happened next.
886613175X|1.0|Part of the months are out of order and didn't see it until I got to the month the issue started with. Then at that point, I couldn't trash it with out losing some of my data in the planner - normally the Moleskin is a great product but this one has major issues and I could not find a way to address this issue with the exception of this review which I feel is inappropriate form.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The Alien Series is a classic movie series that everyone should have in their collection. What's great with the Anthology pack is you actually get 8 films (each movie comes with the original theatrical verson + some sort of extended/special edition one) + two extra disks for the Mu-th-er Mode extra features. The Blu-rays do a great job of cleaning up the picture that even the original print from '79 looks sharp and clean. My only complaint is that the disks are very difficult to remove. They sit inside carboard pages of a book setup instead of having the normal secure plastic locks like on other DVD/Blu-rays. Half the disk is covered by the carboard page, which makes it very difficult to put your finger in the center hole, and makes it impossible to pull the disc straight out like normal. Instead you have to wedge it out with two hands, which causes the bottom of the disc to scrape against the side of its sleeve. So far this hasn't caused the discs to become scratched yet, but I'd feel much better if the discs would lift straight out like normal. Whoever designed the unique design to this way of packing DVD/Blu-rays should go back to the drawing board.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love this game! I used to play this in college with friends. It was a great, safe way to pass the time. I would give this 5 stars,,,were it not for the Ad interruptions. Really is fun! I didn't get on the candy crush train, this is a nice alternative, especially to something familiar.
B009DH2PP4|4.0|The book covers what you need to know about brewing. You might also be able to skip some of the more detailed chapters for later when you start tweaking your recipes.<br /><br />If I should give some criticism. The units are a bit annoying, sometimes there is a conversion for metric and sometimes not. In my opinion it´s better to have both oz and grams, or just one of them. Differing between having one or both clutters the text.<br /><br />Otherwise, happy brewing!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Music wonderful and a surprise twist in the story, Now we know where he disappeared to. Andrew is so talented and brave to continue the story
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is fun, but the challenges get old, and there's not enough time to get limited time things. I don't recommend it for smaller screens.
B0053KWDES|4.0|I am not using this in a standard way. I have a Sansa MP3 player mounted on my motorcycle handle bars attached to a a pair of amplified bullet speakers. I was looking for something to give me a little more volume when on the highway, and to clean up the sound. I am happy with the unit. It was the perfect size to fit with my player. I installed it using velcro so I can remove it easily. I tried it with my Iphone and Bose quiet comfort headphones and it works great there as well. I will be able to get double duty when I travel.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was an easy and quick read. Very enjoyable. It really  makes you think about family, loyalty, and love. Read it!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Everything is just fine except the pics are way too large. I am not used to it. It seems disproportional.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|Kubrick at the top of his directorial craft; acting tour de forces on all parts; visually eye-popping despite the urbanities conveyed; deep, dense theme, symbology, and mise en scenes abound. A feast for Kubrick fans to devour and digest across many viewings.
B00821OX98|3.0|Just another stupid TV series. Slime fest with lots of creepy<br />things. If you hae something better to do ...do it.
0380713802|5.0|....and after twenty years it hasn't lost its power to make me laugh out loud. Ok, folks, don't take any of it too seriously; it's satire - just enjoy it! If tears of laughter don't course down your cheeks when reading his experiences at Spa - then I'm not sure why you'd even bother with this book. He has a marvelous sense of humor, *THE* veneer for statements that under another pen would be eyebrow-raising at best or downright offensive at worst. Let's just say he's mostly wrong most of the time; just an opinionated generalizer, happy to stay so.<br /><br />Bryson went to Europe pre-disposed to find proof for all the stereotypical and universal views many already have about \\"foreigners\\" and make the most of them to fill this book. The French are rude, the Germans humorless, the Italians anarchic, volatile and disorganized and so on, and so on...Personally, I could tell you that the French are kind, helpful and very polite. That the Germans I've met in Germany are exceptionally eager to make you feel at home...and that Italians are my favorite people, but so what? Bill Bryson is a stand-up comic who uses the written word for his stage performance perhaps because he can reach a wider audience while staying safely out of tomatoes' reach this way. You instinctively know he's the one \\"innocent abroad\\" Mark Twain forgot to take along.<br /><br />But if you take him seriously, then Bryson is the dumbest schmuck ever to set foot outside his comfort zone without a chaperone!<br /><br />Why would anyone?
B00CATSONE|5.0|This was a short an to the point read, I love everything and anything Tesla, it is a very sad an disturbing story they way people destroyed an took advantage of his life. He is a misunderstood an mostly forgotten man who deserved better.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I stay entertained for long periods of time! Not like most that get boring after a while. This game will keep your attention.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I have never followed a fad diet or any diet other than my own careful balanced diet and exercise.  I'm a physician, and I don't tend to buy in to diet fads.  However, when my partner told me to read the 4-hour body, the intro hooked me.  Tim Ferriss is clearly brilliant, if a bit hypomanic, and had the time, energy and resources to investigate all the scientific aspects to fat burning and exercise.  He backs up all of his suggestions with the studies behind them, plus all of his crazy self-experimentation.  The bottom line:  his plan works, is easy to follow, one is never hungry (!) and there is splurge day to remove the guilt of eating those taboo favorites (for me it is a baguette and cheese).<br /><br />If you can read more dense scientific material, try &#34;Body By Science.&#34;  The essential message in that is similar.  But most people won't enjoy that one.  Tim Ferriss is fun to read.<br /><br />Try it!
0811879542|5.0|I love this book and so does my 3.5 year old toddler!  He wants to read it over and over again.  It's taught him to follow direction as we turn the pages.
0785814531|2.0|For the price I understand I didn't get it in better conditions. But I was promised a good cover and decent appearance which isn't what I received.

B005MLOKXA|5.0|The characters are dynamic, the tension is palpable, and the story is so well conceived that I just can't stop watching!! Do yourself a favor: Block off a week of your life and watch every episode back to back. You won't be sorry!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I'm not good at games.  My son show me and still I'm just not into the games.  What can I say

B00AATFJK2|4.0|A movie we remembered well from years ago! The ideas are still good; the network control center laughingly archaic. Yul Brenner is absolutely , relentlessly evil in this flick!
B005LAIHQS|4.0|The show is GREAT! I like all three of them. That's not the issue. The problem is my Blu Ray player doesn't have EXACTLY the right software in it to play this movie without errors, it plays the other two, go figure. At least that's what Sony Picture Home Entertainment says. It seems there are layers of encryption that change from different developers, and reworking DVDs into Blu Ray causes mismatches with static programming of your player so your latest player may not play some old re release as it isn't an exact fit. In my case that meant backing up and restarting when the audio would magically quit. I even tried to get updates for my player from the manufacturer but they didn't have anything for the model I had. Maybe mine is just old, out of date, and obsolete, but isn't that the definition of any electronics the day you buy it?
B004KBSQOW|5.0|such a beautiful soft voice caming from such a large man.  learned about him while on the big Island so I have to hve all his work love him
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|I purchased this for a Father's Day gift. Arnold is getting a bit craggy, but carried this action film off nicely.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|This prequel to the Wizard of Oz had some good acting and reasonable CGI effects, but Didn't generate as much excitement in my family as I expected.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A little slow in areas but on the whole a good read! The narration by Death is interesting. I would recommend this book.
B001684L0A|5.0|I enjoyed this realistic portrayal of John Adams. It shows his strengths and flaws, and reveals the strength of his wife, Abigail..
B007IK44CK|4.0|We liked it enough to watch it again when family from out of time visited.  Riveting and well done.  Would recommend it.
B009RX7IX8|4.0|Another strong season of a show that survived the \\"Moonlighting\\" curse.  Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was the out-of-left-field federal job offer for Beckett and the total focus on nothing but Beckett in the last few episodes.  Not much more character development you can give her, time to go back to Castle or one of the supporting characters.<br /><br />Waiting impatiently for season 6.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This is the only time I like to cook. It can be a little challenging but very fun. Trying to get the right color setup is the key.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I almost finished it in one day...just couldn't put it down. Not only do you quickly come to care deeply for the central characters, but become completely swept up in the eerie tale of realms just outside our own.
B003KUSUG8|1.0|When eminem first stepped onto the hip-hop scene back in 96' he's skill back then you could say was a bit below average to down right laughable when you listen to his early material like \\"foolish pride\\",\\"poo bear\\" allegedly of 88' or 93' and \\"yellow brick road\\" and you'll see what i'm talking about. However as time has progressed eminem's skill has improved a little bit releasing classic albums like the \\"infinite\\", \\"slim shady\\" lp, \\"marshall mathers\\" lp and last but not least the \\"eminem show\\" of 2002 which i will definitely say is his last great album before fell off and sold out all together.  In 2009 eminem releases a new album the \\"recovery\\" which was a pop album disguised as a hip-hop album, and while this album did have a few good songs like \\"25 to life\\" and \\"seduction\\" this album overall was trash...this album would be best described as an old saying of how the mighty have fallen, and his lyrics today have really degraded but to blunt eminem has never had much vocal game to begin with his skill was quite limited when he was good during the \\"slim shady\\" era all he had going for him was finesse, delivery, speed, word play and that was it then in the 2010's precisely in 2013 eminem skill is no where to be seen. I would figure for a so called greatest rapper of all time to show these new cats in the game how it's done but no he sells out instead by collaborating with acts he long ago himself would have written diss tracks about drake, minaj, j.cole, kanye and wayne to name a few. I guess ICP was right about eminem all a long but what is worse in the hip-hop community is when a rapper like eminem is considered the greatest rapper of all time by mindless posers of the hip-hop community let alone a legend, Real legend's in hip-hop go above and beyond the call of duty and eminem hasn't stood for anything at all or for that matter written or rapped about an anything relevant and as of lately it seems the eminem fanbase really make you hate eminem more by making this rapper even more overrated than he is right now...this here is truly a garbage rapper that needs to retire.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Omg its the best I mean u have to unlock a lot of things but its totes worth it! I'm nine and its perfect for nine and under u gotta have this app!
B003U51D58|5.0|Followed all the episodes from session one through six, was unable to see season six until just recently<br />Loved trying to figure out the direction the show kept changing to, all the suspense and mystery.<br />For me it was great acting and fantastic scenery.
B0072OFM28|5.0|HAVE ONLY SEEN THE FIRST TWO EPISODES OF SEASON 2, I LOANED IT TO A CO-WORKER LAST WEEK. I WAS VERY SORRY TO READ THAT ANDY WHITFIELD DIED, BUT LIAM McINTYRE IS EXCELLENT IN THE ROLE. THE VIOLENCE SEEMS ON PAR WITH SEASON 1, BUT THE SEXUAL CONTENT MAKES SEASON 1 LOOK PG. THIS COULD DEFINITELY BE TONED DOWN A BIT, BUT FOR A HISTORICAL PERIOD SERIES LIKE THIS, WITH GLADIATORS AND THE CORRUPTION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, YOU CAN'T REALLY MAKE THIS &#34;FAMILY VIEWING&#34;, YOU KNOW?
B004GGM444|5.0|If you like Skrillex you will like this. It hits all the highs. Full of bass. No suprises for you here.
B007REABAG|5.0|I must say that this is it. All the best Cheap Trick in one package and they all sound great. The remastering is pure and flush on all CDs. What a great band. America's answer to the Beatles. Sure, there are some rough spots, The Doctor and Busted are not up to par with the rest of the discs but there are still a handful of good to great tunes on both. I just wish that Woke Up with a Monster was included which was there only release on Warner Bros that came out next. I recommend this to all who love thios band even if you have most or all of these discs.
B00B92ZO3G|3.0|The book gives an explanation of the modern style of selling, it does a good part of doing that, sometime it feels that the book is dry in some chapters, overall it's a great book if you want to understand how to sell.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like freecell better. Entertaining but odds not always in players favor. prefer games with more strategy.  why do you lock me in to a number of words when sometime I can sum it up in two?
B000HN3340|5.0|If you like blues rock than you have to buy this album. This is by far one of there best albums
B001FA0WI4|5.0|Fascinating book, well written. Through the personal story of Sashenka, history comes alive- how Russia transitions from the tsarist regime through thr idealistic Bolshevik revolution  to  the repressive frightening Stalinist era.
0394818237|1.0|This book was probably great 50 years ago.  For a 3 year old living in the 21st century, it's a bit hard to relate.  Not to mention the pages are a bit crowded-not visually pleasant.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Best book ever!!!! Never read anything like it!!!!! Love love love it!!! Good job Rick Riordan you're awesome!!!! Love the book!!!
B00B4Z5GDQ|4.0|Good movie an gives a nice history behind the making of a bunch of classic rock records.  Plus, Dave Grohl is a rad dude and as a musician I understand his obsession with the Neve board.  Solid flick
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I began watching Downton Abbey at season three after hearing so many positive things about it from friends and news sources.  I felt like I had to see the first seasons to fully appreciate the story and I was not disappointed.  The acting, set, clothing, all of the production is very well done.  Looking forward to season four!
B003MC5N28|2.0|This book moved slowly to me it was  hard book to read and listen to but that's just me so you might not think so*
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Great product. Could benefit from a small LED light but the product is clear on its purpose of not having one. Fast charging. Aesthetically clean. Great warranty, no complaints. Anker stands behind their product.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book has been on my &#34;list&#34; for quite some time, and I can't believe I waited so long to read it!  Wonderful examination of human relationships, culture, and everlasting impact our past has on our lives.  Heartfelt, heartwarming, heartbreaking... I couldn't put it down.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Enjoy it just as much now as when I was a kid! Don't like how long you have to wait for free game, though.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This game crashed on me almost immediately, I can't say I hate it because I never got to play it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Easily the worst-written book I have ever experienced...  Iunderstand the need for female escapist fantasy, but at least make it SOMEWHAT approachable and believable...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Finally got around to reading this and was not disappointed. Could not put it down!!!  What a  Great read!!!  Highly recommended
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This story evoked strong feelings of nostalgia for some of the magical times in my youth.  It has the same imaginative quality of John Knowles' A Separate Peace.  Reality and fantasy become intertwined in a way that the reader enjoys the mix, has no intention of changing it, and wants to go back and reread the tale to revive the pleasure of the story's unfolding, and ending with such a satisfying interpretation of the events.  Neil Gaiman weaves fantasy into reality in a way that make his writing as hard to put down as any I have read.
B002APU580|5.0|Beautiful movie. You will not be disappointed! Enjoy the scenery and period costumes and escape for a while. You will love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE MINION RUSH! IT IS A MUCH BETTER VERSION OF TEMPLE RUN. THIS IS THE ONLY GAME I PLAY!!!!!
B007PJFIU6|5.0|Super fun game! I would recommend this game to anybody!  Its different every time you play it!  I like how 6 can play at one time
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Unexpected.  This story goes in many directions.  They got away with it.  When there is extra time, one contemplates. Such a bait and switch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it so much I love love love love it it is so fun it is like the classic temple run but with a twist I will tell my friends to get it!!!!!!!:)
B003KRLKHC|5.0|I loved a good apocalyptic movie. The plot-line is solid and interesting. Lots of great action without relying on that to move the story along. This is more of a character study story and hinges on the actors actually acting and everyone plays their roles well and function as a well-oiled machine to make the movie interesting, believable, and very entertaining. I loved the plot twists and the undertones of cool exuded by Denzel. Rockin' movie all-in-all. Also, I must say that its rare anymore that I'm able to watch a movie multiple times since so few are written well enough these days to handle multiple viewings. This is one of those movies I've enjoyed several times.
B000PHVZNE|5.0|I find it hard to believe that there is somebody out there that hasn't seen Castaway. Except for the sappy love story line this is a gritty movie about survival. This came out before Survivorman, and TV shows like that. I wonder how Les or Bear would have survived on Tom's island. Especially with a very bad wisdom tooth.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|I've read all the books and the movie was like slapping the same title on a different story, but if I hadn't read the books, this movie was great! I'd watch it again anytime.

B000IVW25M|3.0|Movie came promptly. But I don't think it was a digitally remastered video seemed old and hard to hear. need to pay attention to details
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|It has eliminated a lot of the side ads that take up a lot of cell phone recources.<br />It was very irritating when the page would refresh every time a new ad pops up.<br />This app has reduced those occurrences considerably.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|It was a very good purchase and I could here the song clearly. It was a very good use of money.
B000000NN1|5.0|The music on this masterpiece is beyond anyone's description. All I can add is the fact that I hope that \\"Heaven & Hell\\" is the last thing that reaches my ears before I pass on ( Hopefully after another million listens).
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining and informative books about travel that I have ever read. Bill Bryson's humor will blow you away. It is small and yet, full of interesting details about Australia and its people. A must read for anyone interested in visiting or just knowing more about what is it like Down Under.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an absolute fantastic book that is beautifully written. The character development of Hazel and Gus is extremelly well done. I can't recommend this book enough.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was hard to put down. It was very descriptive which might bother some people. Makes you stop and think.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I enjoyed Hopeless, it was captivating from beginning to end.  I would suggest it to all my friends as a must read!
B0011U5E1S|4.0|Let's be honest, Kurt would probably never approve of something like this (neither did the rest of the band). But at least the final result we got was tasteful, if not a little on the short side.<br /><br />The album opens strong with the never-before-released track You Know You're Right. In my opinion, this lost gem is worth the purchase alone, but the album has other merits as well.<br /><br />Next we have all the major singles released by the band over four of their hit albums; Bleach, Nevermind, In Utero, and MTV Unplugged in New York. Though there is one glaring issue; Nirvana's very first single is missing. Yes, Love Buzz was an important single for Nirvana during their early days as a band. It's also notable that the single version has never been properly re-issued aside from the now collectable 7\\" single. This CD would've been the perfect opportunity.<br /><br />Next from Bleach is About a Girl. Never released as a single, and it was actually the MTV Unplugged version that achieved chart success, but no complaints here. Still an amazing song worthy of being grouped with Nirvana's best.<br /><br />The song Been a Son was not really a greatest hit. In fact, it's a bit of a rarity, coming from a rare UK exclusive EP, Blew. Still, it's a nice track to include because it is the only track that hasn't been re-issued in some form or another (Stain was previously released on Incesticide).<br /><br />The rest of the singles really need no introduction, this is just classic Nirvana at their best. Though the one thing worth mentioning is that the mix used for Pennyroyal Tea is a rare remix previously on the cancelled single.<br /><br />Honestly, I think this CD could benefit from more Nevermind tracks, but then again, compressing the legacy of Nirvana down to one CD seems like a sin. In short, this CD's great for newcomers to the band, and even has a thing or two for the hardcore fans. Though if you really want to hear the BEST of Nirvana, stick with the original albums.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Has a lot of different characters doing alot of different things at one time.  Never gets boring but jumps around alot.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is good if you wanna pass time or just board but they realy need to update often but its still good
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing Bingo and this app is exactly like the game on Facebook. Can play in every Bingo room and slot room. Highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The Game itself is fun, but it is way hard to get coins and to have to spend $ to get them is ridiculous. I feel like you keep playing the same levels over and over again and don't get anything for it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is so fun and I play this everyday and its challenging and the minions are the cuties of all there. voices are so cute
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is a must read.  I bought it because my granddaughter's teacher required it for summer reading, and I wanted to be able to discuss the book with her.  I loved it.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|An interesting tool to following trends and  latest developments in your field of interest. Easy to use if not familiar with social network.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I absolutely loved this documentary on George Harrison.  I had seen it 4 times on HBO and I just had to own it.  I loved this man and his music.  He was my favorite Beatle -)  This is a must own if you are a fan.  He was an extraordinary man with so much zest for life.  I found out such interesting things about George I never knew.  We lost a great, talented man.
B000FBFMZ2|4.0|I kept getting interrupted, because of being on a family vacation. I felt guilty about it, but couldn't help stealing away and hiding to read more. Couldn't stand waiting to find out what happened next.
B004J4WLB4|1.0|I thought the author over-romantcized the recovery course of the protaganist and did a serious diservice to neglected and abused children who have spent thier life in the systam. There was way to much use of floral symbolism that had nothing to do with the tragedy of the story. The narrative was lose and ill constructed with too many illogical premises. It is beyond comprehensionthat all those people involved in her life would have allowed her to be alone with a new born and no material or psychological support. I think I understand her intention to draw attention to the lost children of our country, but in my opion she missed the boat seriously.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|this movie is so inspirational and uplifting. I cried, I laugh with it and can't not get enough of it. I would recommend everyone to watch it

B00123KDMO|5.0|This was the last good thing to come from Van Halen. The songs were a continuation of what fans would have expected, but not stale and used. This was  truly good rock and roll. If you want to add a Van Halen album, it should be this one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|so i got season one first loved it and had to get season 2 and guess what ? i also had to get season 3.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|I like this game better that some of the other guess a word games. It's challenging but not too much that you can't figure out the answer
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|so i got season 1 first then after looking at it had to get 2 and 3 now i am waiting for the new season to start. The show provides great acting, drama and a time in history
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I think QT looked at the issue of the \\"n\\" word and found a way to have people say it enough that the rest of us do not ever have to. Sheesh. And when people were shot in the film, they exploded like water baloons, which was at once gory and fairly comical. Put that together with your typical Hollywood super badass who kills hundreds of well armed opponently who magically forgot how to shoot at all and a six gun that shoots 10 rounds before running out in convinient moments for the story and the 2:45 minute runtime got a little tedious at times.<br /><br />That said, there were provacative parts to the film in a good way. The true horror of slavery was shown in a way that most shy from. There is a decent love story behind the film. It was worth renting for me. I do not need to see it again.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Now that I have updated to this new version of Kindle for android I am unable to read ANY kindle books on my phone.  I have other book readers and PDF books with work just fine, but the Kindle app update has been horrible.  When I first installed Kindle on my phone I was excited to read my kindle books while waiting in line etc.  Now every time I the run Kindle app my phone completely locks up and I have to remove the battery.  I contacted tech support, but they were no help at all.  If you plan to read on the go you will either need to invest in and carry a Kindle or buy books from another service.  I love Amazon, but they refuse to listen to feedback on this topic.  All they had to do is let me keep using my older fully functional version of Kindle.

0425263924|3.0|Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales.<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: Another steamy erotic installment, but with elements that seemed to repeat itself.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: New York cabbies were a unique bread.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Love stories come and go. Romances will make or break your heart. But erotica, it will hurt you in such a way that it will be memorable. Sylvia Day's latest installment of her Crossfire series is Entwined with You.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva has gone through so much together, but could they get through something like [spoiler]? There is still yet so much that Eva does not know about Gideon, and it feels like she is only making a scratch at his very guarded exterior. But one thing they both know is that they cannot live happily without each other. They both have risked so much for one another, could they risk one more for their love?<br /><br />The relationship between Eva and Gideon is somewhat at a standstill. At times, I feel it starting to regress. There was a forward momentum of the characters, the story, their relationship that my mind was starting to prepare for the end. The many scenes, steamy or not, are beginning to overlap and mirror each other. Gideon is still as guarded as ever, and at times it is frustrating. But in the latter half of the book, I saw change in him. He knows that he wants Eva, and will change how he is to prove to her just how much he does. Eva, on the other hand, has become to second guess herself. I can understand her thinking, because I know I've been in that place, but after a while, she needs to stop being stubborn and learn to open up.<br /><br />But Eva and Gideon wasn't always the main focus of the story. Cary has his own issues, as well as Eva's parents. It's nice to have supporting characters with a side story, but at times I thought they took over. And maybe it plays into the bigger storyline. And maybe, I just wanted much more of Eva and Gideon than I was already getting.<br /><br />I was excited for a resolution, but I didn't feel I got one. While normally, I love for series to extend into eternity, the story was starting to change its course. The writing was on the wall at the end of the last book, and I was worried with where Entwined with You would take me. To me, it felt like Eva and Gideon were starting to slow down in a manner of progress. I have many questions, and when the story gets stretched a little, the pacing begins to change. I can understand why Day changed the series layout, but I only wish that there were more resolutions in this book that could tide me over.<br /><br />But if I step back, remind myself that this is no longer the end and begin to think this is a mid-point in the series, only then I can make sense of how Day wrote the story. I can then start to believe that everything that has happened is there for a reason. It just feels like a lot to think about for a story that just wants to be told. (Did I mention the angst is starting to get to me?)<br /><br />Despite my qualms and complaints, I did enjoy reading Entwined with You.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: Berkley Trade/Penguin provided me with a copy of Entwined with You.  No goody bags, sponsorships, \\"material connections,\\" or bribes were exchanged for my review.I was excited for a resolution, but I didn't feel I got one.

1455502626|5.0|I think the guys will really like John Corey...I am not sure how the ladies like him.<br />I particularly enjoy DeMille's writing style of a lot of dialogue.  Really makes you feel that you are there for the entire episode and see everything develop as he does.  Almost a &#34;real time&#34; story!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game, could use to have a hint ir two available. Also wasn't too impressed with not being able to advance until I rated the game. overall, fun game and a nice challenge
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|My wife and I watched this one evening when we were too tired to read. Jeremy Renner peaked with The Hurt Locker because of the superior material. Unlike a star, he can't really help elevate this movie to anything beyond direct-to-video.<br /><br />The story idea is clever but the execution is not.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|This series has good writing, is well paced and keeps the viewer interestet. It's more entertaining thistorical and i am thoroughly enjoying the ride.  recommended
B00CATSONE|2.0|The author forgot the first rule he proposes in his book: he did not spend 10,000 hours working at this. The biography of Tesla proposed is more poor than what you find on Wiki, there are no sources quoted, no bibliography, no original thinking, no reading of original sources, no analysis of the patents, no discovery of how the patents are linked to each other. All this is important if you want to track how a genius works. And as there were no women in Tesla's life, there is nothing much to learn.<br /><br />It seems that the intention of the book is to encourage our creativity. Tesla may not be the most encouraging example as people cheated on him and made him miserable all his life. It is like saying: we should all be musicians and then talk only about Webern who was killed by mistake in 1945. Or tell us to become a philosopher followed by a list of all the philosophers that were murdered through history. The example does not make sense in context. But of course Tesla's name attracts readers.<br />The idea that everybody could be a genius is not true. The idea that imagination and the capacity to make links between unrelated notions suffice is not sustainable.<br /><br />I credit the author with a generous mind: he would like everybody to be bright, that is a rare quality. His ideas deserve more real research.
B003730LRY|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this on my Kindle. The picture was very clear! Great movie! A classic for it's time!

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I purchased this mouse after my old gaming mouse broke, and my expectations weren't necessarily high until I began reading the reviews for it. I must say it is a very quality mouse with well thought out button design and grip. It will take a while to get used to how the thumb buttons are laid out, and accidental clicks may occur for the first week or so, but once the mouse begins feeling more comfortable this problem will cease to occur. The on the fly DPI switching and profile switching come in handy. The change of colors is actually more important than most may be lead to believe, as each profile can be set to its own color, making it easy to determine which profile is being used at the time, and though it's true your palm will be covering the color, it is still a very handy feature. I was also pleased with how quickly it shipped (Though this will vary for you). They must have shipped it out of my state or something, because I had it within a few days even with the long shipping option ticked. Regardless, it is a very solid mouse that should definitely be considered if you are on the fence about getting it due to it being so new and so cheap, as it blew away my expectations.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Profile switching on the fly<br />Intuitive button layout that you will get used to<br />It does everything it says it'll do and it does it well<br /><br />Cons:<br />Doesn't feel right in a mousepad that has a wrist rest<br />No stickers, Anker?<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Get it
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Couldn't stop watching it.  Love Steve Buscemi.  Writers were not afraid to kill off a main character.  Loved the costumes and real life characters written into the show.
0547564651|5.0|My wife is a high school educator.  I am a small business owner.  When the book arrived I read it and was amazed at some of the insight.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I love politics - the good and the bad.  It makes for great drama.  Kevin Spacy and Robin Wright are wonderful together.  I did not like the reporter though.  She was too unbelievable a character.  She was too young to have developed the leverage and knowledge of Washington that she did.
0066620996|5.0|Some reviews were not so great on this book, however I really enjoyed it.  Jim Collins is an easy read.
0375413405|5.0|Love the original book. It looks like it's vintage with the blue paper cover. Great recipes that are sometimes difficult but ALWAYS a hit!
B002YRZ1VA|5.0|Chaka at her best and just a great collection of amaxing songs in one cd. This is a must have for music lovers.
B008JFURII|5.0|I saw Red and Red 2 and both are excellent movies.  The acting was great. The cast was excellent and the movie was funny.  I can't wait till it comes out on DVD.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zita-Jones were a great addition to the cast and blended well with the original cast.  The ending was not what I expected but was great.  It is worth seeing again--both of them.
B00634GHJA|4.0|this app really works well.  I wanted to transfer my photos and videos from the computer to the Kindle and back without needing the cable and this app did the job.
0399162097|4.0|Witty, insightful and lovely.  I loved the imperfect narrator and the beautiful unfolding of this odd and believable story of being a sister in an imperfect family.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|You have to concentrate hard to remember all the characters, but it's worth the effort because it is so interesting.  Now to buy the next book!!
B0090KZDSK|3.0|...its like reading a repeat - same old, same old and we get nowhere.  Books ends only to discover that one now has to wait for book 4.... never ending....<br />not great at all :(
B00B97TMIE|4.0|Imagine Dragons is a soulful amalgamation of pop, rock, electronic and ethnic folk, and surprisingly, its a blend that works. Some tracks on Night Visions are stronger than others, granted, but it's an all around solid release. The band's sound, both lyrically and sonically, is upbeat, introspective, and motivational, often all at once; it's a refreshing combination. If you're looking for some new flavour to expand your music collection, give Night Visions a try.<br /><br />By the way, the music video for Radioactive is hilarious fun.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I like how  you can pay with other people. Lots of fun !  I do wish they would start you out with more play coins and give you more ways to earn coins but altogether really fun
B008220BP2|5.0|Yes, it's not your 'traditional' zombie movie, so if you consider yourself a zombie purist (because, of course, fictional species only work one, maybe two, ways) or only a horror movie fan, then you're likely to be disappointed. But, it is a well-made zom-rom-com that reminded me stylistically of Princess Bride; if you're a fan of that movie, give this one a try.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Third book in the series A song of Ice and Fire, and so far my favorite.<br />The first book set the tone. The second book seemed all downhill for the readers' favorite characters. This book seems balanced, and is more enjoyable. As usual there is a lot of descriptions, however the storyline is still great as the drama of the feuding families continues to unfold. Best start with book one however, and after book two you will have to continue to 3 and probably 4...

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Beautifully done. Great story and awesome ideas. I love the crossbreeding it's a lot of fun. I wish it was easier to get peanuts though.
B007V65R54|5.0|It took me quite some time to get through it mostly because Silver goes into a good deal of depth on each of the topic this book covers. If you're interested in how statistics and predictive analyses factor into every thing from earthquake and weather prediction to sports betting and politics, then this is a must-read, in my opinion. Silver really breaks down the intuitive and rigorous methodological application of a central concept of probabilistic analysis, Bayes' theorem, in all types of common scenarios where accurate and precise prediction are crucial. Every story presented in each chapter is really quite interesting, and it's clear that Silver did plenty of research. As I said, &#34;The Signal and the Noise&#34; is a must-read that I think that most people interested in hot topics of big data analysis will enjoy.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The update to the weather channel app is a huge step backwards.  I find the pictures distracting and the light colored wording hard to read.  Because the picture is full screen, the local details are in a balloon that will not get larger effectively making it much smaller to read on a small screen.  There is nothing I like about the update and I am looking for alternatives for my weather information.

Excellent.<br />Direction?  Excellent.<br />Cast?  Perfect.<br />Acting?  Hilarious.<br /><br />Tim Robbins is couldn't have been better in his &#34;Mr. Deeds Goes To Town&#34; simpleton role; but adds an element of physical comedy that is hard to find these days.  His facial expressions and clueless stupid, remarks are always well timed.<br /><br />Paul Newman is the perfect jerk executive in one his last starring roles, and was quite a find for this cast - sure, sure.<br /><br />Jennifer Jason Leigh does a fair job of mocking-up Catherine Hepburn, but can still pull-off the pouty little girl just as well.<br /><br />Also loved Bill Cobbs' role of Ole Moses; both in narration and onscreen.<br /><br />Tying all of the acting and script writing together is the direction of the Coen brothers, who have succeeded in bringing a bizarre, surreal, cartoonish bent to a movie that is a pleasure to watch, listen to and laugh at!  See it.

B00B10HAO2|4.0|--Before I begin I would like to warn you that this review may contain spoilers.--<br /><br /> First, I really enjoyed this film. The first time I watched it I wanted to learn more about the great, one and only Alfred Hitchcock. I wanted to re-watch 'Psycho'; that film being the subject the story revolves around. Now, 'Hitchcock' is about more than Hitchcock's search for his next film or the filming of 'Psycho'.  'Hitchcock' explores the relationship between Hitchcock and his films, his worries, his actresses, and (most importantly) his wife, Alma.<br /> In terms of casting, Anthony Hopkins is the perfect Alfred Hitchcock. From the opening scene when we are first introduced to Hopkins' character and greeted with Hitchcock's signature line, \\"Good Evening,\\" from his television series, `Hitchcock Presents', the essence of Hitchcock is captured. Helen Mirren plays Alma Hitchcock. Mirren is a phenomenal actress in every part she plays. This is especially true of her portrayal of Alma. She flawlessly captures the love, doubts, insecurities, and longings of her character.<br /> The story of 'Hitchcock' focuses on the search for the next Hitchcock film and the filming of 'Psycho'. Hitch has just had a successful premiere of 'North by Northwest' and is asked by a reporter, \\"...but you're sixty years old. Shouldn't you just quit while you're ahead?\\" This leaves Hitch with doubts and a desire to find his next film that will prove his ability to continue to be a part of the industry he influenced so much. That is how Hitchcock came across the novel \\"Psycho\\" and decided it was just the thing he was looking for.<br /> One of the things I enjoyed most about the 'Psycho' aspect of this film is how scenes and interactions between Hitch and Ed Gein are added. The opening scene depicts Gein and his brother working on their farm and Gein's murder of his brother. Hitch appears in the scene informing the audience of some of Gein's history and how that influenced and was directly responsible for 'Psycho'. In another scene, Hitchcock is dreaming, confessing all his worries and insecurities; Gein is the person Hitch is speaking to. In this film, Gein represents the darker side of Hitchcock; the side Hitchcock suppresses and expresses only through his work.<br /> The relationship between Hitch and Alma is another aspect of the film. The devotion and gratitude that Hitchcock felt toward Alma are a big part of the relationship between Alma and Hitchcock in this film. The insecurities of both characters are shown through Alma's struggle to accept Hitch's obsessions with his leading ladies and Hitchcock's jealousy over Alma's friendship and association with Whitfield Cook. When Hitchcock is bedridden and Alma takes over directing a scene in his place so that they may get back on schedule, the film is paying homage to Alma and the genius that Hitchcock believed her to be. They worked together on Hitchcock's film and most of Alma's contribution was not acknowledged.<br /> Overall, 'Hitchcock' is a film that is about more than Hitchcock's struggle to make 'Psycho' and in the way he intended. It is more of an acknowledgement of Hitch and Alma and their contribution and mastery of the film industry. All parts of Hitchcock are explored in this film, from his obsession with his mother and his actresses to his humor and his love and appreciation of Alma. While many things have been exaggerated for the sake for entertainment and to depict Hitchcock in the way the director viewed him, the film stays true to the important parts of Hitchcock and his history. I think that all the different sides of Hitchcock were portrayed in this film in a way that honors Hitchcock as a man and director. I would recommend this film, because as I mentioned, it made me curious to know more about Hitchcock and re-visit the films created by the master of Suspense.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is wonderfully written and researched. It provides a story of the decline of a great mind and the effects on career and family with compassion and insight.
1452115567|5.0|I love Maddie on Things.  It is heartwarming, funny and inspirational.  Some pictures made me laugh out loud, but it's the overwhelmingly positive story of a man and his rescue dog that stays with you and makes you get up in the morning and totally live your life.

B0012GTZC0|4.0|Liked the story. Writing was well done. Will try.more of this author's works. I like world war era stories. Wish some parts were not as predictable as the were.
B008469DGY|4.0|Nothing like real golf, but still really fun! Flick Golf rocks! Great game for all ages! Super fun! Only reason for only 4 stars is I wish it was free.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The reader is brought immediately in to the drama of the unhappy girl but through constant love and the language of flowers she softens enough to allow others to be close to her instead of her usual running away from intimacy..
B0043WHRWA|1.0|The screen jumped throughout the entire video making it difficult to watch.  At other times it just froze for a few seconds also making it difficult to watch.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This is a wonderful, un-selfconscious collection of music and culture rescued from obscurity.  It reminds me of my high school days -- even though the orchestration is not dated.  Rodriguez has a voice with qualities a bit reminiscent of Jose Feliciano, but he is much more relaxed.  The real value and charm is in his thoughtful lyrics.  Shipping experience was good.
1439102813|5.0|Certainly sad and no happy ending tied up with a little red bow, but a strong telling of the descent into Alzheimer's Disease.  The book is believable and helps to find the compassion needed to deal with the subject.  It also serves to help us not ignore &#34;the elephant in the room&#34;, but instead to address those afflicted.  Like Alice's family, we tend to talk around the victim and not make every attempt at keeping them engaged.  A lot of insight as well as research went into this book.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Finally a free game that you can play as much as you want without having to pay for it.  This game is very addicting.  Love that it is playable on my Kindle Fire HD.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Could've done without the instrumental and I always find myself skipping &#34;Neon Cathedral&#34; but otherwise, I can put this on and not skip a song. The non-radio songs are SO much better than the radio ones so definitely give it a chance.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|the subject of this book is very interesting.  I personally found the book entertaining and will read other books by  this author.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have kids but I still make time every now and then to spend a few minutes on this book.  I am automatically taken into another world!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an insightful look at how young people handle cancer. Entertaining and I loved it...even though it was sad at times. There were some humorous times as well. I would definitely suggest it to others to read!!
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|Quality and realism very good for it being free , pretty impressed so hope to see a full simulator in the NEAR future.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The best part is that this is more than a Zombie series.... its more about the human drama in the midst of a crisis. One thing though, season 3 has started to remind me more and more of &#34;Jericho&#34;..... Don't get me wrong, I loved Jericho..... but seeing its fate, I hope TWD does not follow suit.
B001DM1VXE|4.0|Darren Aronofsky's Pi is a sharply written, tightly paced, brilliantly acted, economically filmed, twisted, mind-bending, thought-provoking, tense, suspenseful, difficult, but excellent debut psychological thriller from one of America's most distinct and ingenious talents.<br /><br />This is a film for thinking audiences who want to exercise their noggins. This is a film for fans of David Lynch's early work, or for low-budget, twisted, ingenious neo-noir, psychological thrillers such as Christopher Nolan's [[ASIN:B004H05V0I Following]] or Lynch's [[ASIN:B00A5IXYR8 Eraserhead]]. Often Kafkesque in its strange but endlessly fascinating subject matter, and so smart and mind-blowing it will give you migraines, Pi represents a stunning debut by Darren Aronofsky, later to be famous for films such as Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, and Black Swan.<br /><br />Pi was made on a shoestring budget of $60,000, shot on cheap high-reversal black-and-white film, starring many actors known personally to Aronofsky, who also wrote the screenplay and the story, produced, and directed the film. It further marks the first of several profitable collaborations between actor [[ASIN:B000RZAENG Mark Margolis]] and composer [[ASIN:B00004Y6Q5 Clint Mansell]], whose dark, edgy score brilliantly fits the disturbing, claustrophobic, cerebral tone of the film.<br /><br />Pi encompasses themes such as numbers, patterns, the Torah, algorithms, codes, secret languages, obsession, paranoia, fear, self-destruction, and the dangers of knowledge; in short, all my favourite themes. In a world where most thrillers have buff heroes running from huge explosions or punching/shooting each other for half the running time, it is comforting to know films like Pi exist; smartly written, quietly tense, effectively acted, low-budget films for a smart, thinking audience.<br /><br />We need more films like 3.141592653589793238462...I could go on. It's PI. Five stars out of five!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Interesting movie.  Good story, good special effects.  Don't like the idea of a child at the end.  Why would the aliens create fertile clones?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I think this game is fun and keeps thinking. It kept me entertained and interested through the game. I found it . Addictive and well worth the money I spent for this game'm e. I recommend it for everyone to play.

0316201545|5.0|My daughter had heard about the author Chris Colfer from his book \\"Struck By Lightning\\", and how he writes in his free time. He has had a lot of free time since being cast on the show \\"GLEE\\" that he has written a few books . Now my Daughter is on the hunt to read them all! He does have a unique style to his writing that is second to none.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|So worth the money for this collection!  The movies were clear and just as I remembered them.  The price for 6 movies together is about the same as renting on On Demand, but these movies are mine!  Great buy for great movies!

0736092269|4.0|I've been struggling with my muscular 3D character sculpt for quite a while but after purchasing this book I managed to fix my characters main back muscle errors in less than an hour. This book is wonderfully illustrated, showing muscles in action from all kinds of angles and highlights the muscles used for each movement which makes it easier to understand how the muscles interact. Definitely my favorite anatomy resource so far.

1609611543|1.0|First of all, don't shoot the messenger.  If this approach (removing wheat from your diet) works for you I am very happy.  None of us should be fat, and anything which gets rid of the crap that Mad Men sell to us is a Good Thing.  But I'd like to post a contrary opinion to this process (and, more importantly, the book) in the hopes it will also help people.<br /><br />A little background -- I was *very* fat at a very late stage in life.  Retired, tipping the scales at 235 with a waist of 46\\" I was a prime candidate for all the nasty things that happen to people when they let themselves go (I think my salvation was being plenty active -- I play tennis 4 or 5 times a week and even at my heaviest I got a lot of exercise).<br /><br />I did get the weight off (lost 70 pounds, waist to 32 inches, off all the medicines that keep a fat person alive and their heart still working) and it took me about 9 months.  I've kept it off for the last three years, mostly by just eating healthy and all the reasonable things you might expect and read about (#1 tip though -- ditch ALL the caloric drinks.  Trust me, guys in particular, these are the killers.  Stick to unsweetened tea and water and that's almost all you ever need do).  As healthy as I am, though, I'm always on the lookout to improve so I picked this book up, read it cover to cover, and gave the precepts inside a shot.<br /><br />The book is the biggest problem -- you don't need this book.  Basically it's one argument, repeated again and again, based on ONE study (and a flawed study at that).  He even admits the study isn't completely relevant to weight loss per se, but then goes on to say it is and... well, just says it over and over.  There are a *few* recipes included, but the bottom line is this: if you buy for even one moment that you need to kick the wheat habit, then don't bother with this book (if you don't buy it this book will be unlikely to convince you).<br /><br />My own personal feelings is there are many people who WOULD benefit from stopping wheat entirely.  Many, but not all, and perhaps even not the majority.  I tried it for three months, was completely faithful (cooking my own \\"bread\\" with both coconut flour and almond flour -- actually pretty tasty and I enjoyed both but a lot of work) and did not eat ANY other crap -- no cookies, sweets, no artificial sweeteners (I deplore those as well), only raw or healthy foods in reduced calories that has stood me in good stead for these last three years and kept my weight -- and waistline -- where it needs to be.<br /><br />The results?  After three months I actually gained about 2 pounds.  However, this isn't statistically significant, as my weight now in the last three years fluctuates five pounds (if I keep it in that window I don't get fanatical about it).  So I stopped all the non-wheat bread making and cooking and went back to MY diet (which does include wheat, although only 100% whole grain wheat) and ended up losing five pounds in the first month (again, not statistically all that significant EXCEPT in relation to the comparison of being on the diet and off it).<br /><br />IOW, being \\"wheat free\\" did nothing for my weight and, frankly, made me FEEL a lot worse.  (For one thing, I was more constipated -- and I eat LOTS of fiber.  But I just wasn't getting the easy and \\"good\\" fiber I think I get when I eat whole wheat).  Again, I realize there are folks who will feel better not consuming wheat, but I ain't one of them and if you aren't either you shouldn't feel bad.<br /><br />I think everyone ought to at least give a wheat-free diet a try IF they are overweight or otherwise feeling poorly.  It certainly can't hurt and it does make you consider a lot of things about what you consume.  But don't spend the money for the book (unless you just have lots of money -- in which case I'd be glad to accept donations :>) and don't feel bad if it isn't the cure for you it seems to be for others.  We're all special, in our own ways.<br /><br />Stay healthy and stay thin!br /><br />Stay healthy and stay thin!
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|I'm a little late to the bandwagon of praise for this singer, guitarist and album.  Glad I made it.  She's a fine blues singer and a great guitarist.  I enjoyed all the songs and her duet with Sandy Landreth on Slideshow was just that.  I had no problem with any Serbian accent because I didn't really hear one.  Just great music. I will be buying more of her music in the future.  Happy to recommend this to any blues fan.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I actually worked on the visual effects crew for this movie and you would think that I would say nice things about it.  But to be honest it is slow and boring and does not capture the essence of the original TV show in any way whatsoever.  This director's cut version does fix a number of flaws in the original release that Robert Wise was uncomfortable with due to the lack of time.  I remember working 18 hour days on the visual effects for the last several months of production and we barely got everything done that I was assigned to do.  There is no question that this is a classic Star Trek, and this director's cut version is must-see for any diehard Trekkie - especially for the special features.  It's just that ultimately it is a long slow movie with endlessly drawn out special-effects with actors sitting there with their mouths open staring at visual effects or the very sexy new enterprise in its drydock.  Let's face it, the original TV show almost always had fight scenes, direct confrontation with weird alien creatures, and Kirk or someone had to have at least one love interest.  And hey, there were no red shirts to be expendable in this movie!  So as a movie it completely misses the mark in the whole Star Trek TV series canon in my mind.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Such a great movie. Anne Hathaway really does an amazing job, as does the Wolverine. The Gladiator's voice takes a bit of getting used to, but it's fine.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Mr. McConaughey  is an excellent actor and I will remain a fan. There is a lot of violence. The young boy actors were excellent also.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Well written and absorbing account of politics and life in the time of Jesus.  Author does not dispute or argue religious belief, but offers evidence-based perspective on the Gospels and other New Testament writings.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is so fun to watch how the other side lives.  This family has drama, love, and problems, just like we all have to deal with.  It's just that there problems are a little different than what we have o deal with.  A great family!
B006O7XOOW|2.0|I bought this for my 7 month old son, who is in the stage where he likes to pull up on everything so that he can stand. The balls and lights barely keep his attention, but as I thought he likes to pull up on it. The only problem is that when he pulls up, it tips over. Maybe he's just \\"strong\\" but it's definitely not sturdy enough for him.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|While the stage doesn't rotate, the considerable and different strengths of the cinema are skillfully applied to make this a memorable experience for the discriminating viewer. Not all voices are superb, but all the acting is.
B0019TYQ38|5.0|An amazing movie!!  If you love the classics, Pride and Prejudice,,,, you'll love this movie!!  Excellent!! I highly recommend it to all!!
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Take the time to sit down for 65 hours (that's what my kindle said when indicating the time to read)<br />But don't worry, the story is great, the characters are interesting and well described.<br />There are hundreds of people that pass... that's difficult, but doable.
030758836X|2.0|I was looking for something different, which it was, and did read the reviews that said the ending was not great, but thought that other people's reviews on books rarely agree with my own. I should have listened to them. Because the ending was so awful, I wish I'd never read it. To be fair, the first 99% of the book was really great. I know that the movie rights were purchased, and I'd go so far as to say that if they &#34;fix&#34; the ending, I would see it in the theater just because I want to like it that much!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|This is my second Garmin GPS watch, and overall my fourth Garmin product purchased to date.  I love Garmin products in general, and I'm happy with this watch in particular, except for one annoying quality: poor battery life.  My last Garmin GPS watch would last quite a long time -- perhaps 2-3 months, with me using it actively for maybe 3-4 hours per week, before I would need to plug it in and recharge it.  With this watch, however, it will go from 100% charged to 0% within two weeks, even if only use maybe 1-2 hours per week.
B00D4GNN6A|5.0|The author's more than 15 years of dedicated study in this non-trivial subject of Jyotish Vidya by a western student is unparalleled. Hart has truly understood the multiple aspects that affects the accuracy of Jyotish.<br /><br />This is one of those books that one feels fortunate that it was written, such detailed & thorough study of a lifetime captured & synthesized in one book.<br /><br />It's not an easy ready, but for someone who wants substance... look no further.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|If you are going to read this book have tissue by you're side and be ready for an emotional rollercoaster. The only think I have to say that is bad is that John Green went a little crazy with the \\"big words\\". I don't know, I'm a 16 year old girl and I think I have never heard of some of the words in this book.  I mean I understand that Hazel is a lot more \\" grown up\\" then most 16 year old olds but still it just didn't seem very real to me. Other than that I absolutely loved the book props t John Green!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This mini series is very entertaining.  Manages humor, action, and has moments of poignancy.  I highly recommend this movie if you're into war films/documentaries/docudramas.

B008N9AASC|1.0|I enjoyed the beginning of this production, especially the dancers and the views of temples.  It did indeed cause me to feel serene and look forward to what other delights await.  I am a great admirer of Asian culture and religious expression. This otherwise mesmerizing presentation<br />then takes us to a huge chicken farm where hapless chickens are rounded up by some sort of<br />dastardly tractor and prepared for slaughter. We are then treated to seeing their innards cut up<br />on an assembly line.  Don't fall for the hype surrounding this dvd, I don't see how the wholesale slaughter and dismembering of chickens is relevant to the enjoyment of a beautiful \\"travelogue\\"<br />of parts of Asia.  Too bad...I may have to give up eating chicken as well as red meat.<br />On a scale of 1 - 10, I would give it a nonexistent minus 5.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|This is a very enlightening game. It gives you a first hand look into why the GOP base acts the way they do.<br /><br />I've always thought it funny that the Republicans have attached the American Healthcare system. And I now know why, There is no need for healthcare when all you need is a little \\"Snake Oil\\" to \\"make your leg feel better\\". Or how about their attempts to weaken the federal government and give more power to the states? Well according to the game local police are nothing more than Barny fifes who can easily be knock off their boats by slamming into them or making them crash up against rock walls. On the contrary though when the Feds come in they bust up your moonshine operation hence you get rid of the Fed's power and your free to do as you please. And that brings us to the last tidbit. Taxes, As every Red Blooded Republican will tell you paying taxes is un-American and if you have a small cash only business running contraband from place to place the last thing you want to do is contribute to society.<br /><br />This game will explain everything to you.<br /><br />Ok now that I have had my fun and have insulted half the population here is my real review.<br /><br />Game wise this is actually a pretty good time killer. Its a good bit of fun but it has a few things that \\"irk\\" me.<br /><br />For starters, As you go from race to race the amount of money that the gold and silver bags give you increase. So while a silver bag is worth $1 in the first race its worth much more 5-6 races down the road. The problem with this is they either need to start you off with lets say $2000 in cash or make it so that you can get more than $530 in the first race. My suggestion? just pick an amount that each bag is worth, lets say silver $20 and gold $50.  And stick to that for the whole game.<br /><br />Secondly There must be some sort of flaw in the game. Sometimes after a race you get a screen that says something like \\" so & so just broke trhe record for shine production, shine is at an all time low price\\" But I have played many a game when I get none of those screens and some games where I have had 6 or more of them. there is no consistency.<br /><br />Lastly I'd like to see more interaction. For instance why can you knock the cops off their boat, yet they can't knock you off? (same with other people on the river).<br /><br />How about losing money for damaging property? Or a destruction mode where you get points for damaging things. I think the cops should be able to arrest you if you get caught. I'd like to see more scenes have options for different boats or to buy upgrades. Definitly more challenges and LONGER races.<br /><br />My biggest complaint? Is the inconsistency between games. I can get EVERY money bag but yet if I get stuck with crappy market prices I end up with a low $ amount at the end. I don't understand how I can score $318 grand one game and $24k the next.<br /><br />With some more development this could be a great game.shine is at an all time low price\\" But I have played many a game when I get none of those screens and some games where I have had 6 or more of them. there is no consistency.<br /><br />Lastly I'd like to see more interaction.

B0071BGOJC|1.0|But the Kindle edition is hopeless.  Every time I close I need to record percentage of book read because it never syncs to the last page read.  Sometimes you need to shuffle thru hundreds of pages.  Finally got the paperback out of frustration which is less expensive than kindle.  Not happy with this. I expect more when I have to pay more for digital book than a tangible copy.  boo to you Amazon, bad performance here.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|By this book I'm skimming most of it because it's more description description description - for a tv series to make sure the set and costumes look perfect??? Good grief.  There may be closure with some of the stories somewhere but I give up and I'm very sorry I paid for all five books - too bad - book one was great but this has become silly and silly me for not realizing it by book three.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|I am not real sharp on the computer, but this program requires more in he head Davy than I have
B000FCKGPC|2.0|More description description description but less plot plot plot ... there is  no closure on this story and I'm hoping book five will do that.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I like the case and it fits the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; very well.  The only thing that I don't like about it is that when propping the case up on the side that it doesn't always stay there because there are no ridges to hold it in place.  However, I would still recommend it to anyone with the Kindle Fire HD because it is a sturdy case and if it should fall off a chair, the case does protect the Kindle.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|So simple in the concept, yet much harder than it looks. Graphics are pleasing to the eye.Good variety of options for play. Love it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I truly enjoyed doing these puzzles.  However, I didn't think there were enough puzzles and there should have been more.  Yes, I would recommend these puzzles to others if they are interested in this sort of game.  I looked for other puzzles like this, but was unable to find more.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|A very pleasantly written drama with a wide breadth of characters and issues. The writers manage to write from a diverse number of viewpoints and do not get mired in a one dimensional presentation of the class structure, and setting they have so elequently presented.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|This is one of a long series with a well-developed &#34;universe&#34;. This is the only one I've read, so I didn't worry too much about the backstory and just enjoyed the ride. Interesting sub-plots, fast pace, fairly humorous in general. Struck me as a bit old-fashioned, but that doesn't bother me.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is one of those rare books that envelops your every being as you read. Told from the perspective of the wonderfully smart, funny, and insightful dog Enzo, you will not be able to put this book down until you've read every word. Joy, anger, sadness, satisfaction, this book has it all and you will never feel the same after reading it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved the book and loved the film. Yes its a formula done many times before, and yes its a youth book and film; but the story is engaging and the film has been well cast and shot.<br /><br />Switch brain down a gear and enjoy!
0553057006|5.0|This book keeps things simple, but really gives you the tools to look into your life, your beliefs, your behaviors and your past to start giving the answers as to why you feel like you're less of a person than others. It also brings you the awareness to know that you aren't alone, that actually you're probably part of the majority of people out there who feel this way and are dealing with something similar.<br /><br />If your parents rule your life (as an adult), if you think that maybe this may be relevant to you, it's definitely worth looking at. It's not even all that expensive...
B0027MJU00|1.0|....however amazon did refund the purchase price. I liked 'gone girl' and was looking forward to reading this title too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy the game and the goals are always fun. I have to admit I was a bit concerned when the goals were met but didn't remove from my list. I contacted customer support and a rep named Max was able to help right away. Now I'm back to playing and having fun! Great game. I love the minions! And Awesome customer support! Thank you!
0486407217|5.0|I enjoyed this book and you can trace over the patterns and also make these outfits for dolls or enlarge them for human size.  It is great to read even from a historical look into fashions that were once worn even if you don't sew you may find this book very interesting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this book on a suggestion from my co-worker and have not been able to put it down. He kept me thinking and I was pleasantly surprised by twist at the end- never saw it coming! I am looking forward to starting the next one as soon as possible! Thank you Hugh!
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|The production values are astounding.  Joss Whedon filled the screen with a plethora of visuals and sound.  The sets are vast and the special effects are as good as you'll ever see in this genre. Evil beings try to rule/destroy Earth, virtuous beings get banged up but save Earth. I guess there were novel and clever exchanges among the super heroes but I couldn't tell you what they were.  If you're a super hero fan, you'll love it.  I'm not a super hero fan, so I didn't love it and thought it seemed long. And it is pretty long at around 2 1/2 hours.  The best thing about it from my perspective was that the end credits went on almost as long as the movie, meaning tons of people got paychecks.  Joss Whedon and Marvel are our best hope for salvaging the American economy and restoring the American dream.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Good game, kids love it. Little ones recognize the characters, older ones enjoy making a home for Nemo. Very good game for kids.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think it is a great game. This app works well and I would recommend it to others. It has given me hours of fun.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|So, the wonderful thing about Neil Gaiman is that he writes quirky books in which fantasy and reality are at a wary truce. .  Previous books I have read by him were beautifully started but often ran out of plot before the end, which is far more frustrating than reading a poorly written book.<br />In this book, however, Gaiman has his groove on.  It is wonderful and weird and absorbing on the things it does not explain as much as those it does.  At its heart is a pure love, not a romance so much as a deep friendship for which sacrifice is ultimately demanded.  I won't bother with plot--a popular book like this will have plenty of plot description reviews--but I will recommend this book with the highest praise.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Addictive game, anyone who loves tetris will enjoy this one, and it has its own intereseting style. Worth a try.
B00B935SUY|5.0|This is a really well done documentary about the legendary Sound City recording Studio and it ends with a great message: When people work together to create something, amazing things can happen. I love a quote from Mic Fleetwood at about an hour and 20 minutes in \\" I think the downside these days is thinking I can do this all on my own. Yes you can do this all on your own but you will be a much happier human being to do it with other human beings...and I can guarantee you that.\\"
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This is a pass the time away type game.  Something to do when you are really bored.  But the younger kids like it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's a great story,  it's also full of inspiration for your life. I loved it and i want to read it again and again.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun.  I really like it. I always liked Bingo and this adds the extra twist to it.
B0042X9L6A|3.0|Thought I would want this flash unit, but just don't shoot enough places that I would use it....got a Gary Fong Puffer and find it fine for most indoor shots.....and at $22, it seems to be a good compromise. Sentthe SB-700 back with Amazons no hassle return policy...they were great (as usual), and now I'm eying the newer SB-400 which is half the size and weight...
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Bought this same model for my son starting 8th grade middle school (3 years ago). He is now starting Junior year high school and finally required to replace after carrying heavy loads of books constantly. Hope Wegner has built to same specs because can't praise the first pack enough. The new pack looks identiicle. Won't go into detail about the technicality. Suffice it to say we agree with all the 5 reviews posted here.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|This is the &#34;Trinity&#34; version from AMD of their Accelerated Processor Unit architecture. For all of my clients that have custom systems from me, they are quite happy with these. For everyday basic stuff, like email, facebook, internet, etc., they work fine. If you need more raw processing power, like video and photo editing, you definitely should look at Intel's new Haswell architecture. But for those on a budget, this APU, paired with a Gigabyte A85X chipset motherboard...well you have a fine system. You can even play games on this without the need for a discrete graphics card (assuming low to medium settings depending on the game). It then becomes really easy later to add a Radeon graphics card from AMD if you want. With this APU, keep in mind it performs even better if you use faster RAM. I wouldn't recommend RAM any higher than DDR3-1600, because of reliability. Speeds above that are not as reliable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Didn't know I would like it so much!!  I highly recommend it!  I watched all three seasons and can't wait until January for season 4!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Typically I &#34;discover&#34; a great series after the fact.  After watching season 2 I realized that I need to see the entire series to fully understand the characters.  Destined to be a classic.
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|You need to type the word exactly right in order for it to work. I don't like the user interface either.
0226039331|5.0|Great for personal study! I use this resource as a quick reference tool!  It is easy to read and presented in a logical manner.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This idiots guide to building your book for publishing for Kindle is a great step by step guide.<br />The only thing that appears to be missing is how to write the content!!<br />Would have liked more explanation using diagrams, particularly about placing charts and images.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|This movie was hyped up as something very special.  No, it wasn't special.  To us it was just an okay movie.  One of the reasons we went for it was because it starred Denzel Washington and he hasn't been very focal for some time.
B004FHBO9K|3.0|i ordered the 2 LP clear limited edition and both records were warped i returned it and those were also warped.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I loved the book and knew this would be a hard story to transfer to the screen.  While it was very good in parts in other parts it changed the story line.  I was disappointed but knew the movie could not live up to the book.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Being a 'Die Hard' Merlin fan has been Thrilling!!!  The casting is a job well done; Colin Morgan was the perfect Merlin.  To me, the sad part is the fact that Merlin's identity has been kept a secret.  By the fouth season, King Arthur and Merlin should have been friends and working together.  Exciting adventures and quests could have been woven into the story line pitting Good against Evil.  A lot of the mystic and connections to the unknown seemed to be missing.  Merlin had great powers that were not taken into consideration in the story line, but it was still a great season and a must for viewing public.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|I believe all that was said, I'm just having a problem adapting it to my situation; as in How do I identify my target audience when the book is about sailing, scuba diving, skiing, sex, and love, spread over the Caribbean and the Mediterranean.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|first time I installed the update it ran slow and did not perform anything like the original. uninstalled it.<br />tried installing it 3weeks later and now it wont even run.  this time I will uninstall permanently and try some other weather program.
B005B19UPE|5.0|Great content and interesting style in this story about a little known aspect of the Holocaust -- that of French police officers cooperating with the Nazi occupiers in rounding up Jewish families.
1451695195|3.0|Although I found the book very interesting, I felt that what he said in a book could easily have been condensed into a shorter version -- think Readers Digest.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Super neat, interactive. Lets my 3yr old deal with shapes, sounds and identifying animals.<br />Love it!!!!!!!!!I would recommend this item.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Tom Cruise was his usual realistic self, great special affects, good plot, over all a very entertaining flick i give it 4 stars. Ed Koller
1484021851|4.0|I've read other books on speaking and this one was better than I expected. It is easy to read and understand. The author gives practical advice but then uses great excerpts from other speeches to bring his points to life.  I would definitely recommend it.
0812993845|5.0|I love this gals books. The are happy, goofy, enlightening and enjoyable and you tend to have maybe experienced<br />One  thing or another she has written about.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I now own two of these lights. The motion detectors seem to work well but one needs to place them in a good location to work properly. Good product could use slight improvement but does a good job of providing battery operated light.
1451626096|5.0|I am a book junkie and have lots to read. This is in my stack and I am sure I will read it within 2 days time.
159562015X|3.0|I was told about this book by a few people. I purchased it and took the online quiz...be advised the book must be new to take the online quiz since the access code can only be used once. Overall, I received insightful information but the quiz which is a huge part of the book that explains your results goes by fast and skips questions if you take longer than the allotted time (about 30 sec or so) to answer the questions. As a result of not being able to answer all the questions I wonder how accurate the strength assessment results are.
0385342071|5.0|I loved this book and you begin to root for your favorite character after the first few pages. Definitely a great read.
B003QSLW0K|4.0|This movie does not get the credit it deserves. My first grader loved it. It has a lot of quality lessons for kids but also keeps them entertained. It's also just a pretty cute movie. I strongly recommend it for kids and parents, especially if you haven't seen it before.
0807014273|5.0|Viktor Frankl beautifully explains the transformation he experienced in the Nazi camps, despite the ugliness and suffering that surrounded him. His life experience is truly inspirational and awakening. Highly recommend it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game will be fun for your whole family. Despicable Me takes a whole new twist on Temple Run 1 &amp; 2. I would chose this game over any other.  BEST GAME OF 2013
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is a fun game, but you cannot play unless you're on wifi.  So, for example, you cannot play it on a flight or somewhere without a signal.  Nonetheless, a very fun game and i'd recommend it.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|The Star Trek franchise was an endangered species by the end of the 1960s. Fortunately, it has proven more resilient than most. When a decision was made to tamper with original episodes, the plan by nature needed to be pretty good. With a little tasteful restraint, the producers have proven it is possible to make a fine old thing better. As others have pointed out, the remastered TOS gets rid of the scratches and graininess, throws in a dose of well-chosen CGI, and quietly succeeds where others have failed. I have watched the original series countless times since it first came out in the '60s. The remastering on these sets is nothing less than brilliant... and I am treasuring watching every one of them (even Season 3). So give away those old sets that do nothing to improve the quality and treat yourself to these eye-catching rebirths.
B009LDD22U|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is truly the best show on TV.  It's extremely funny and entertaining.  It's everything you would want in a sitcom.  Season 6 is my favourite season so far because it focuses on the evolution of the characters and how they are becoming who they are.  Great acting, great script, great show.  Period.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This season was every bit as good as every season of Dexter.  I won't spoil it for you but be prepared for a real cliff hanger in the last episode of this season.  I'm literally in pain awaiting the next season so I can find out what happens next.  HA HA!
0064471837|5.0|It is incredibly refreshing to find a fantasy adventure novel for young adults that is not only intriguing and unique but also well-written. Replete with strong characters, narrative twists and turns, and just the right smattering of romance, Sabriel is a must-have for any fantasy lover!
B007EECSFA|4.0|This author writes another lengthy novel, but the reading is worthwhile.Be patient to learn the twists and turns.The novel covers several social issues including the London bombing during WWII.The reader is also exposed to the Australian terrain.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This game in all its different permutations has given enough me hour  of relaxing fun. I am so glad I got the deluxe app.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|From time to time, all of as need a breakup, just to relax, not to think, not to talk, not to answer...<br />To look busy, to everybody  and simply push the monkey to jump. This is very good, very good,...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So cool that I want to hop in the game...........but I don't want to get hit by the trains I just want to keep running.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|If you like this kind of games do not look anymore. Just stop here, you are at the wright place. There are nothing more to compare with this. Just bay it and enjoy.<br />That's my opinion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is SUPER fun!!!!! I love doing the competitions!! I also love how real everything everything looks! Its TOTALLY worth getting!!!!!
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Fantastic show of a surprisingly relatable serial killer. Dexters charm is so entoxicating you cannot help but smile at every murder made.
0375842209|5.0|Get ready for some cliches, because this book was beautiful, sad, tragic, heartwarming, heartbreaking, funny, emotional... all of the above. It's also unique and very well written. Put simply, I loved everything about it, and my only minor complaint is that the author sometimes gets a little crazy with his metaphors and similes.<br /><br />I am pretty sure this is one of those books, which, along with its characters, I will never forget.<br /><br />9.5/10.<br /><br />\\"I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\\"
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I find it serendipitous that a neurosurgeon was able to deeply understand the realm of consciousness--for the benefit of all of his patients, if for no other reason. I enjoyed the book and his narration. An alternate and novel (to me) method of meditation is presented in Mr. Monroe's work. It seems there is much more to be learned on the subject, to say the least :)
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Nice feel good movie with good acting.  My wife and I enjoyed watching it.  Maggie Smith as well as the other actors did a great job!
B009WUBERW|3.0|A bit overkill with the scenes, and the attempt to give this movie a story line really did not work out...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really cool makes you think.  You should really check this out.  You will find yourself staring trying to figure it out
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who loves historical fiction.  I love the characters and the writing I just wish my favorites were not leaving.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I read almost all the reviews and some said it was horrible and others said it was great its amazing!
B00004YTIQ|4.0|On lazy days, didn't feel like messing with the ropes that keep it on. Elastic would have been great!! Otherwise just what I had in mind to keep our blow up pools clean.
B0043URV5U|5.0|All the songs are here, even Ramblin, Gamblin Man, which was not done with the Silver Bullet Band.  This two CD set is a must if you don't want to cycle through all your individual CDs to find the songs whose words you memorized.  Truly, \\"You Can Come Back, Baby, Rock and Roll Never Forgets.\\"
0670014893|4.0|I enjoyed the book, the plot is compelling and, for a le Carre novel, relatively easy to follow.  The characters are likeable. As he does in all his novels, he makes a strong case for the political/philosophical positions he advocates.  The only aspect of the book that prevented me from giving it 5 stars was the ending. I found it abrupt and unsatisfying. If the main character is going to be a continuing presence, as George Smiley, I would (will?) have a more positive feeling about the ending.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great app, I wish it had more puzzles, but for a free it has quite a few, it has some categories and you can select wich puzzle and with how many pieces.
B00E7PQVHK|1.0|I love this game but it wont load after downloading.....not a happy camper right now! please fix as soon as possible.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Liked this app until they &quot;upgraded&quot; it. Hate it now. My husband already removed it from his Kindle fire and I will remove it from mine as well. Even if it was free.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game for people of all ages who love horses. I HIGHLY recommend it for horse fanatics. There is so many fun activities and competitions to compete in
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Loved the book and now the series. Mixes action and some good humor. It will keep you reading. How can you not like a guy who loves the Earth, has a sense of humor and carries a big sword.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|As much as I loved Google Reader, I believe that I love Feedly even more.  The interface is slick, it is easy to find and add feeds, and it syncs across all of my tablets, phones, and computers.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have about Feedly is that it sometimes mixes up the order of the blog entries between pages.  I can tell when this happens because I see duplicate entries that I have already browsed.  Despite this problem, there is an easy fix:  just return to the previous page of entries and swipe to reload.  Otherwise, I have no complaints and I probably read more blog entries now than I ever did with G Reader.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Simply uplifting, a must read for absolutely everyone! I have read it at least a dozen times and still love it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved all the hunger game books. Couldn't them down. I recommend that everyone should read the hunger games trilogy.<br />Great books.
B0092AAVR6|5.0|I was delighted to finally find a copy of the account of a Belgian sister's interesting life as a missionary in Africa in the early years of the twentieth century.
B00DNLXDUW|5.0|I uplpaded this and it took little to no time. Works very well.  If you are familiar with Gail it is a petfect choice.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I liked the movie very much except for the end when after the Bond car is blown up, they still track down the escaping old timers and shoot M in the Bond family chapel. Here M dies of her wounds leaving the gap for another new M to take over. Also a younger Miss Moneypenny, as if the series is just starting rather the twenty odd shows. All in all art imitates real life once again.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Its interesting and does clarify the circumstances pertaining to life during the life of Jesus, which have never been  raised at any time during my religious upbringing. I do consider it worth reading.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game but needs directions to be available after playing the first time it goes away and it doesn't tell you again how to play the second level. Also requiring to pay real money to do certain things sucks. You need to play a very long time just to get anywhere near to use the special options. Wish you could just earn them rather  than having to spend money. I would rather pay $5 for a full game then having to pay for any of the special items.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I liked the way Follett interwove fictional characters with real historical ones to bring the World War I era to life.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Fast cleaning of cache including browsing history, emptying trash file in recycle bin to free up disk space etc. Would recommend the program to PC user to periodically clean up their disk drives.......
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|if you like complete random explosions with no real story this is it. I loved all the Die Hard Movies before this. There was no sense of direction for this movie. its just a bunch of explosions for no reason.
B005IQ5H7M|5.0|Excellent book simply put another Vonnegut masterpiece. This was an excellent read not as extreme as some other Vonnegut books  like Galapagos but still couldn't tear away from the story.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best books ever written. A wonderful story about love, life, family, and not taking a single moment for granted. Breathtaking.
B00BB8UJKG|1.0|This was a boring movie- no climax, just a 2 hour movie about life. I would not recommend. Do not watch
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Loved it from start to end. If you like sci-fi movies you will not be disappointed at all with Oblivion. Tom Cruise does a excellent job. Amazing scenery throughout movie.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Great album. This band is all over the place musically, but it works well! Listened to is so many times!
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Riveting and keeps one on the edge. In light of what has been written about, FBI, NSA and the CIA and their narcissistic minds, this is all the more believable!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|lots of fun...requires a little thought,  helps with memorization. it took me a couple of hours to get to level 10, now I cant go any further. would have given more stars if it went further
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Saw the movie first the started reading the books. Very well done. Books are always better than the movie, great movie awesome book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it so much! And I haven't played for long. It is one of the best games I have ever played.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It's visually terrific, and Tom Cruise carries the movie, but the plot and story was not always tight.  Morgan Freeman seemed to be somewhat of an afterthought, even though he's billed as a star.  Overall, it was still an enjoyable movie to watch.
B00DU74U74|2.0|This movie felt like a fast-forward version of the book. The unique love triangle was completely missed, the bond between siblings was ignored, and it veered from the book too often. If your not a big reader and still want to experience 'The Host', I suggest getting the audible version. Your imagination will far out weigh the waste of money and time spent on this movie.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I actually watched Lincoln twice - I thought I wasn't in the mood to watch it the first time around, so I watched it again the following morning (or at least tried too).  It's a well written, well acted movie that looks terrific, but beyond the last 30 minutes or so, I found it difficult to stay interested.  But in the end, much too much verbiage, and not my taste in movies.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Madonna improved more and more her career and her abilities, and this show touches all aspects between light and darkness. A complete show that I called \\"a must see\\". An spectacular music and a meaningful story created. I saw MDNA TOUR in Cordoba, Argentina, that happened to be her last show of the tour.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I have a very nice pair of Audioengine A5 speakers at home but was a little shocked that the only inputs on it were a 3.5mm headphone jack. Plugging in a typical 3ft headphone cord into the speakers created tons of system noise from my computer and other interference from other digital devices in my home office. I was ready to sell the speakers and get something different when I thought I'd just give this DAC a try.<br /><br />For only $25, this little device completely changed the quality and performance of my speakers. I can now listen at low volumes without system noise and static. The audio is also crystal clear and delivers the kind of quality the A5s were meant to have. I actually have punchy, well defined bass and clear highs.<br /><br />It was an investment well worth it and I was so pleased by its quality I purchased another DAC for work.
0547978847|4.0|It was an awesome book for my nephew. I originally read this book in Haiti in french. I thought it was a great read, so I decided to share my experience with my nephew and so far he has loved it very much.
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|In the end there is absolutely nothing redeemable in this story. The special effects are good ..but honestly..not Oscar worthy as most it is made up of a lot of washed over lighting to hide the obvious problems with the detail.<br /><br />The story itself is not all the great either and eventually falls into the twist ending category.<br />When you learn the true story you end up reflecting back on the entire story and cannot find<br />anything redeeming about the main character. This leaves this movie as one not worth owning under any circumstances.<br /><br />A few plot holes exist with the biggest being the owners of the main ship that sinks actually taking the time to listen to his story. They just want to know how the ship sank for insurance purposes..his story lends nothing to that end and they probably would have left in the first 5 minutes.
0345529057|5.0|B&N was selling this for 35.00 and I needed a couple of other books which my total turned out to be 100.00. Amazon total under 50.00 plus free two days shipping(PRIME MEMBERSHIP).<br /><br />As far as the books, I have yet to read any of them. I have been lazy to start them but I am sure I will get to it. The show is awesome though!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I used the fitbit one for the last 18 months and it was excellent!<br />It tracked my everyday steps, sports activities, sleep ( a bit rough, but understandable), calories (even doe a bit exaggerated) and after syncing with the tower and the website, I added the foods I ate and with the activity it helped me calculate the amount of calories to eat the following day and also if I \\"behaved bad\\" I immediatelly knew!!!<br /><br />but after my withings pulse arrived, I wore them both for 2 weeks, and I then realized that the Fitbit was a bit exaggerated/incorrect on almost every data it provided.<br />ex: steps: there were always 1000-1500 steps extra with fitbit, even doe I wore them on the same pocket and didi exactly the same thing.<br />  calories: fitbit showed calories expended even doe we were still, and the pulse only charges calories if you in fact move!<br />  sleep: the pulse shows exactly what we should know, the deep sleep, light sleep and awake time<br />  The pulse syncs directly to my iphone 4 and don't need the tower or Bluetooth 4.0 to be able to do it<br />  being able to measure heart rate with the same technology has the mio alpha<br />  the interface on the web with the dashboard is excellent<br /><br />So ending this long evaluation, the withings pulse is, so far, the best activity tracker in the market!!! (while comparing to the leader FitBit!)
B00B7PIRIE|2.0|The seller I'd rate as excellent.  The discs are not playing well.  I don't believe it's our dvd player.  I have to stop each disc, remove, wash/dust off and try again.  Then it has issues in a different spots.  I'm wondering if the set was a \\"reject\\" set. . . .
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great graphics...cool.....loads of fun...definitely a plus download to have when you want to just play around and pass some time.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Set up Mr. Washington's character of the pilot immediately and made no excuses for his behavior.  He was consistant throughout but makes you wonder if pre-flight procedures are thorough enough.  The film immediately reminded me of Rod Taylor in &#34;Fate is The Hunter...&#34; foibles, but ultimately a good pilot.<br /><br />I was surprised that for a Blu-ray film there was no other data, behind the scenes, out-takes, documentary...nothing but film.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I think now Tom Cruise flicks get a bad rap, just because you either love him or hate him.  However, this movie is more than Tom Cruise.  It was a great Sci-Fi flick, with all the right stuff. (space pun intended)  It was not as predictable as others have stated.  I was surprised a couple of times.  Worth the rent, or if you're a 'love him', then buy it.
B008UTV6S8|4.0|Paul Simon delivers the usual and is quite good.  He's almost boringly reliable in his delivery. but that's a plus in this genre.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I have been looking for a replacement for AVIA for some time now and this is it.  this is a great App!
0312641893|5.0|i got it in good time and it looks great. i love this book. i couldn't wait to have it for my shelf.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia Keys is fantastic.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|The authur did so much justice in writing this book.<br />As I read the book I found my not being able to put it down. The way Adam life was depicted with all the trials and tribulations he went through along with his family are expressed so clear that at one point it brought tears to my eyes.<br />most can relate with Adam experiences.<br />As I got close to the end and learned of Adam death and sacrifices again I came to tears. I felt as though I was not worthy of the life I have knowing of the sacrifices that so many young men and women in the military make to allow us the freedom we so cherish.<br />I am seaching on line to learn more about Adam and the Seal team members that he died protecting along with another book written by this author.<br />RIP Adam, though I did not know you I feel like I got to know you based on how the author wrote this book.<br />I hope some one in Hollywood makes a movie of the life of Adam Brown!!<br />Definitely makes you search your innerself to see how you can do this different to help others and the way you live your life.
B004PUG7MG|5.0|I got this album on sale, which makes it even better!<br /><br />I am not a good writer when it comes to reviews, especially on music. However, if you are a fan of her music, then this of course is a no brainer, just get it. You'll love it.<br /><br />If you are new to Avril, I can't say anything, because I do not remember a time without listening to Avril. Listen to the demo songs, put her on Pandora or iHeartRadio, see if you like her songs before purchasing.<br /><br />I know this is probably not what everyone was expecting for a review, but, this is the truth from my eyes.<br /><br />Happy downloading :D
B003YP7N9O|5.0|Virtually every Tull fan agrees Stand Up is a bona-fide classic. Not much more needs to be said there. This lp is probably their best in my opinion because it's their heaviest with strong rhythm guitar throughout most of the lp that makes tracks like 'New Day Yesterday, 'Back To The Family' and 'For A Thousand Mothers' some of the best songs they ever did. The live gig is great again because of Martin Barre's heavy power chording (in my opinon, the live rendition of 'My God' blows away the lame studio version on Aqualung). But at long last, the full length 6 min+ version of the non-US B-side Seventeen finally makes its digital debut. Supposedly Ian Anderson did not like this track, hence its notable absence from the 'Living In The Past' double lp but this was always one of my favorite Tull tracks (with its multitude of guitar overdubs). It was good to include mono 45 mixes of tracks like Living In The Past but Chrysalis blew it by omitting the mono 45 mix of Sweet Dream (which  has only a single tracked vocal and is superior to the stereo mix)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is fantastic, and even better without the sponsored announcements at the beginning of each episode found on other DVDs.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting and story line are first-rate.  I am very upset about Matthew's fate, however - especially after everything Matthew and Mary have been through and the fact that they are so likable.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Even now, hearing the first strains of the Downton Abbey theme music makes me ache for the ending of season three and impatient for the beginning of the next.  This is surely TV at its best. Thank you, Julian Fellowes and thank you to everyone associated with this fine production.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game, but wish there were more levels. Kept me thinking and were times I was stumped. :)
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|The products works well but it takes a lot of effort - I guess there's no real easy way to cut a glass bottle - The product does score the bottle but there's quite a process to get it to break.
B00634GHJA|5.0|it transfer the photos and videos very quick. The only little issue is that I had to use your browser to connect my macbook pro to the phone. I downloaded the app to my mac but it did not work to connect with the phone.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|The biography was general &#34;what happened in Steve Jobs's life&#34; which was ok. It was inspiring at times to see the qualities and the vices of such an influential man. A definite read for all those who was to be more than what they are.
B005K17RU0|4.0|when i first got this app on my tablet it had a widget on my main screen with the local weather, Alice's samsung has the widget also, but the version i keep finding do not include this, only an icon. can't find the right version, this is version 3 something. the one on Alice's tablet is version 12 something. took it off after i saw no widget on main screen.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I wish you didn't have to pay to play but over all its the best game ever! GET THIS GAME!
B004UPANAI|5.0|Great movie for marvel and x men fans, fits into the series, lots of actions, good story, overall it was great
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie was a funny, refreshing lexperience.  I really enjoyed watching this movie, it was not distasteful in any way.  I had to buy it so I can watch it again and again.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Great movie for marvel and x men fans, fits into the series, lots of actions, good story, overall it was great
B0038VPB5W|5.0|Another solid album by these guys. Looking forward to getting other albums to add to my collection. Very good for a modern metal band.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Great movie for marvel and x men fans, fits into the series, lots of actions, good story, overall it was great
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|IMHO the best album they have put out ot date. I first got &#34;Twilight of the Thunder God&#34; and went on from there. I have 5 or 6 of their albums, can't remember and this is by far the best. This isn't anything dark or evil in the music, it is where they come from and their history and heritage and they do it well. AWESOME ALBUM.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Great series! Even the first two movies look fresh in the new blu-ray format! I really missed these movies! Aliens is one of the bestowed of all time!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Have see all three of these movies and to watch them again one after the other was great. The &#34;Legacy&#34; was alright, shame it wasn't Matt Damon again but can see this progressing along as well.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great adventures for Holmes and Watson with a modern twist. The Great Game is my favorite episode of the three.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This was still a good movie despite the change in actors. Good continuation of the series...still lost on the blue and green pill thing, but defintely see this continuing.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Play with me. This game is fun and if u like dragons. This is the game for you. So come and play
B00BX3KZAS|3.0|I have only listened to it once and think I will have to listem to it several times for it to grow on me. I am huge COB fan and have all their albums but this one is missing something. As I said need to maybe listen to it a few more times. If you have never heard of this band this first album I would recommend would be their fifth album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game on the kindle! Add Redstone dust, levers, pressure plates, enderman, buttons, more spawning eggs, caves, pistons, slimes, sticky pistons, npc<br />Villages villagers, pumpkins, iron doors iron golems, and snow golems in the next update!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Finally got to see what all the hype was about. Great movies and definitely feel they left an opening for more in the future. Has a very modern twist no retro stuff like the previous movies.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|A really good book and I would recommend this book to other people who have just of a hard time like me.!
039472903X|1.0|I have to say, the product itself is terrible! The first day I opened it the pages started to get loose and when I started reading it the problem never stopped, the pages kept getting off. The size and shape are not very comfortable to read it either.<br />On the other hand, the text itself is pretty good. I just graduated from Advertising and is a great way to stay fresh on your acquired knowledge while getting a job in what you like.<br />I'm giving it a low grade because a product that defective can't have more than 3 stars.
B005ZI306S|5.0|Fantastic book about something we've all caught ourselves doing. Yes, I still avoid cracks in sidewalks. We love the author's stories! Highly recommend this book to parents looking for truly unique, creative and one of a kind story that is a joy to read. FIVE STARS!!!!
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|It is an adult story.  Sort of another version of &#34;Cocoon&#34;  Story of how some professional senior citizens live.  I really loved it!!
B00101ZOTA|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times since it was released in the theatre. The Usual Suspects is a solid and suspenseful movie. I can still argue about who Kaiser Soze is or should be.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Even though Clint Eastwood is nearing the end of his career as an actor he still has it when it comes to down to earth good o'l  family stories such as this. Just basic family good stuff. I'm glad I selected the purchase of this movie as it wasn't another boring beat them up shoot them down garbage. Well done Clint.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Wonderful story for all ages, I loved this movie. Maggie Smith can do no wrong. The acting, costumes, scenery, props and the fabulous home was outstanding.<br />We will be watchng it again, Time after Time :)
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another good one in the Reacher series.  Lee Child writes a very good story each time.  I'll continue reading these until I've read them all.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Enterprise is the best of the Star Trek spinoffs. It rivals the original series (but with better special effects and consistantly better story lines).
B0081336FO|5.0|Great modernization of a classic and you don't get better casting these days then Cumberbatch and Freeman. Plus there are more episodes to come
0553385461|5.0|There is a lot to absorb in this book. Hawking tries to dumb it down as much as possible which makes it enjoyable, but don't expect to understand everything right away. Especially if you're not a science reader to begin with. Most of it is a breeze and should be read to help understand the fundamentals.
B004G6009U|1.0|I am late on writing this review, but I am just now getting around to replacing this BluRay/DVD set.  I guess I take this risk buying used merchandise, but I expected a working product.  Neither the BluRay disk or the DVD disk works- both skip after about 15-20 minutes into the film.  My daughter has never been able to watch this movie through!  We have two brand new blu ray players and a high quality dvd player, so my equipment is not the issue.  Both disks have visible blemishes on them.  I would never buy a product from this seller again.
0425166805|3.0|I wanted to see what all the hype was and I couldn't take the history channel as my source. I wanted to read the book to see if anything was lost in the translation. I was bummed to see fiction disclaimer on the copyright page but after reading it I understand why. Interesting to read but make sure you understand that this isn't real whatsoever.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the first movie &amp; still need to see the 2nd one, but this game is fun &amp; challenging.
B00138GZAC|3.0|That's right, I don't think she has anything else worth listening.  Smooth operator brings me back to the 80s, when most of the songs were great and I was also in my youth.  She probably should have stopped after Smooth Operator.  Not sure if she had any success after that song.  But I guess she had to sing what she can do to make money.  Probably had a short career.
1582701709|1.0|This book should be given to starving people so they can just visualize some hamburgers for themselves, because they have a bad attitude about starving to death. Not my lines, they're Chapelle's but I totally agree.
B000HZD0CS|5.0|This is one of the best Star Trek movies.  A real pleasure to watch and be entertained<br />with this one.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Had hard time downloading this game.  When it finally downloaded, was unable to play the game.  Took it out of my Kindle.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I am really torn about rating this book because although I enjoyed the book, I felt that it was kind of a weak attempt to draw out a story that should be coming close to an end.  I've read there will be two more books in the Crossfire series, which I will most likely read for continuity, but I think Eva and Gideon's story could have ended by the close of this novel.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|If you like the book - Rework, you will definitely love this one.<br />Lot of common sense advice which we may have forgotten.<br />If you want to be creative, read this book and by the end of it you will be compelled to create something.<br />I enjoyed this book.
B00846REIS|4.0|Like the title says, there is very little about this book that is realistic, but I enjoy the indulgence of what it offers from the over the top characters to the intimate scenes that made you go hmmm....I read this book in two days and highly recommend it as a great escape from reality!
1612680011|1.0|This book gives you some general ideas, not a specific information. This book is good for people who have graduated from primary school. It is also an advertising platform to sell a game he has created called the Cashflow which he keeps mentioning it. Basically I feel like fool after reading his book. Not an ethical thing to do.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Good continuation of the first novel.  I read this book in a couple of days and enjoyed every bit of it.  I don't want to give too much away but if you liked the first novel 'Bared To You' you'll enjoy this as a follow on to Gideon's and Eva's love story.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The best out of the three so far. You fall in love with Gideon and Eva even harder.  And, despite their pasts, you want them to work it out - even despite what happens in the present.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was completely Hunger Games ignorant. Out of a desperate need for entertainment I chose the movie on Netflix. It was so good. I was complaining about the ending on Facebook because it felt so incomplete. A number if friends informed me that it was a three book series. Whaaat? I had no idea. They also assured me that the books were better.<br /><br />I bout he trilogy. It was awesome. The movie stayed very true to the book with a few inconsequential differences. This is an awesom, if not short book. It seemed fairly speedy to me for the length of the trilogy, I probably should have checked it out at the library and returned it in 4days... That being said, now it is a part of my personal library and one of my top four go to vacation books. It is a great read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The best of all three so far! You'll fall in love with Eva and Gideon even more. And despite their issues, you'll root for them and get tangled up in their love affair.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|From the first chapter to the last, it had me wanting to read one more chapter.  Looking forward to the sequel
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved this game  very challenging.  sometimes a little frustrating  but kept me coming back for more.  try it i think you'll like it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am 17 I do not cry a lot only when I feel lonely I didnt cry at my grandparents funerals but anyway the emotion in this book is conveyed in such a way it makes you stop Cry and think about it I became attached to Hazel Graze and her struggling story all I'm here to say is that this book is an amazing read and no thought should be taken just buy this damn book
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|The book started out with promise but quickly went down-hill.<br /><br />Yes, it's fiction but even so, some events in the book just made me cringe.  For example, the part where Robert and Katherine got fooled AGAIN by Malak and was tricked to come to his home to see Peter. HELLO!!!!  Peter was just 'allegedly' discovered in the home by security personnel and police officers, wouldn't they have whisked him off to the hospital?  After all, it's only his hand that was cut off.<br /><br />I was just dying for the book to end and was miserable as I got closer to the end.
B003ABZCX6|4.0|Reasonable price and fast shipping.<br />Good seller.The vinyl sounds as it should and it is in good condiction<br />The vinyl sounds as it should and it is in good condiction
B005MMY9A8|4.0|What's not to love by a 7 year old boy? My son loves all superhero movies. Please put up more.
1452000247|5.0|I was hooked on this book from the first page, engaged in Peter's world.. I was fascinated by the imagery the author created. I will recommend this book to my friends. Great Job, WIlliam!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I think it can use more costumes for lower prices to start out with. Also more places to run. That's my opinion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subways Surfers is really fun and the best app I've ever had.I wish they would have a way for you to create your own character.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show will suck you in! I couldn't get enough of it. Everything piqued my interests; the story, the characters, Violet's witty remarks, the scenery!  I am seriously having withdrawals now that I have watched all three seasons.  I have never wished so hard for January to come.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Makes me very grateful to live in the United States.  We  don't  realize  how much we have and how little others have.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|If you like puzzles and brain tests, this is a have for you! I am not really challenged by puzzles, but this game has me stumped more than once! Plus, it made me feel smarter whenever I finished a puzzle.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I like the historical aspect of the &#34;soap opera&#34;  programming. It has drama, yet adds history that some of us don't really know about the old English manors and lordships.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|I really am anxious for volumes two, three and more.  I am completely humbled by listening to this album.  I amazed by the talent of George Harrison's heart and hands and ears.  Most of all are first takes.  This album is great for taking a shower, doing the dishes, a candlelight dinner, long drives in the car and wiggle ball in the backyard.  So many songs that consume me one after the other.  This music is good for the heart and soul.  Has improved my meditative life!!  Thank you so much for relinquishing these treasures.  Truly looking forward to more.  Peace.
B00A9X7X6C|4.0|A lot of action in this movie. Futuristic fiction...actors work well in this movie. A lot of violence...would not recommend for younger ages, and the squeamish.
B000PMG16U|5.0|At almost age 40, how did I never watch these? I got this for my son for Christmas and we watched them all (plus the originals)within a few weeks. I fell in love and am now a fan.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I used to work out at the gym but my joints didn't precisely enjoy it. So finally I decided to try getting rid of weights. Well, after half a year I couldn't be happier. Convict Conditioning is really a great method to start practicing calisthenics. You need to be patient, though, and constant but it works. Plus the author explains you why calisthenics are a good alternative to weightlifting in a thorough and enjoyable way. Convict Conditioning really works!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I was going to hate this show. Surprisingly, I can't get enough of it. It always seems to end, right when you want it to continue. A finely detailed show. The characters are complex, and seems to amaze you with a new emotions, each episode. From the brat King Joffrey, to the tearful cry of Arya Stark tale.<br /><br />Each character has their own path to follow, although, it hard to remember who is who, and who is related to whom, and who killed whom, and why. I have to watch season 1&2 again.<br />The graphics are amazing, and the detailed writing, whoa what such amazing details.<br /><br />Also, very nice to see Carice van Houten, what such a beauty.<br /><br />My only dislike with the series is that there have been so many films with a similar plot, ideas etc, its really nothing different.<br />Its like every idea in fantasy, horror, drama is mixed up into one series. Additionally, sometimes its hard to understand the dialogue, ends up sounding like a lot of mumbling.<br /><br />Yet, the acting is so compelling that you grow to love the show just for what it is, and want to see how the story will unfold.
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|We turned it off 30 minutes into the movie. I believe seventh graders could write a better story. It was lower than juvenile. I can't believe I had to pay for that when I am a prime member.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is one of those movies that is really deep.  It is entertaining and gets one to think.  VERY deep.  Would watch it again.
030758836X|1.0|There isn't a single character in this book who is likeable or who I really cared about. The characters were all completely dysfunctional and selfish.  I couldn't help but wonder why so many people gave this book such wonderful reviews.  Is it because when we read a book like this it helps us to realize our lives aren't really that bad afterall?  Has reality TV caused us to believe this is normal and lowered our expectations of good literature?  There were also some glaring editorial mistakes in time.  At one point the author said she had been \\"sweetening him up for several weeks\\" when she had only been with the other person a few days.  My opinion, don't waste your time reading this book.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|this is a good starter RPG for people that have small amounts of time available to play. I like to play this.
0307386171|5.0|The entire action of the book involves just two people, and takes but a few hours, but this telling is consistently captivating. McEwan examines the few actual events (and there is but one key event) from every angle, a many-faceted examination of the hows whys and whats, both before and after, focussing on the internal perspectives of the protagonists. Poetry-like in its exquisite description of detail intriguing and enlightening.<br /><br /> A really fine (shortish) read from a writer on top of his game.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good games within the game, but wish it would enlarge more during ho.  Fun to play, but you do need to figure out the different rules.  LIKE THIS ONE...
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and liked it enough to buy.  Which was actually pretty surprising, since I cringed at the title...Cowboys and Aliens, are you kidding me?  Yet, I love Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, so I thought what the heck?<br /><br />Actually, this a fairly decent movie all things considered.  Daniel Craig's character, Jake, wakes up all alone and not knowing who he is.  Things rapidly go from bad to worse as he heads into town and finds he is a wanted man.  Harrison Ford's character, Col Dolarhyde, has a jerk for a son who also ends up in jail at the same time.  They are do to be shipped off for justice when...OMG, alien ships show up and \\"lasso\\" some of the townsfolk, stealing them for who knows what diabolical purpose.<br /><br />A possee is rounded up, headed by Col Dolarhyde and a reluctant Jake, who happens to have the only weapon known to bring down the bad guys, even if he doesn't know how he happened to end up with it.  Also included in the possee is a girl, a preacher, a kid, and a dog...and they later encounter outlaws and Native Americans.  There are gunfights and men and boys growing up and learning how to find their bravery in the face of terrible odds.  There is the wounded hero in Harrison Ford's character, who learns his own lessons along the way.  There is the love of gold.  There is honor and hope and hardship and a hint of humor and irony.  How much more Western can you get?<br /><br />Because this IS a Western, despite the aliens.  It also shows that, when the chips are down, human beings will band together against an outside threat no matter their previous differences.<br /><br />Daniel Craig does a great job in this as the stranger who has lost his way only to find it again.  Harrison Ford is even better, as the craggy old man who's seen too much death and betrayal, only to find he still has a heart of gold under it all.  The minor characters also have their own passages to undertake and it all meshes together along the way.<br /><br />This is not my favorite movie, I must admit.  But its not bad.  You have to love Westerns, though...otherwise this can come across as just a sf movie with a strange twist.
0920236162|5.0|book is a fun topic and an usual story.  I recommend it for ages 8 and up.  easy read and enjoyable.
B002M80918|5.0|It was nice to see a 4-star movie that we had missed in the theaters.  I would recommend it to everyone!
B00DURILJ2|5.0|A must see.<br />I loved Mud and so has everyone that I recommended it to.<br />A classic.<br />It was pitch perfect on every level.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|my original cable that came w/my Kindle Fire stopped charging the Kindle..was wiggling in the slot..<br />called and switched w/this..it is GREAT so much sturdier and heavier..works fab.  Absolutely no problems..best thing I ever did.  Was hesitant at first..but w/return policy it was no problem.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|AZADA IS a game of games. You have to solve several different puzzles -- in a time limit!-- to get to the next big puzzle which leads to more games! Love it! The time element really pushes you to think fast. There are limited hints and if you didn't solve in time, you can start that section over BUT you get new puzzles! Same kind of puzzle but a different one than before. Fun and addicting.
1616551631|5.0|A fantastic artbook that draws you into the setting.  A must for any SF or Gaming art & design fan!  An inspiration source for us SF artists!
0425263924|3.0|I haven't finished reading...but I can't get past the 1st couple of chapters because I'm looking for something more extreme.
B005HSL626|5.0|We love this game the people who wrote bad reviews are crazy because this game is AWESOME and i am going to upgrade me and cousin Jay love this game because you get different blades  and AWESOME backgrounds. And all you crazy people are wrong because fruit ninja is the best game ever. And all you crazy people are going to be crushed cause weve unlocked so many things the end.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a decent puzzle game that requires you to explore one or more rooms, gather and use objects, and solve various puzzles to advance from one floor to the next (the game has ten levels). Many of the puzzles involve unlocking items using combinations of letters and numbers that can be discovered in other areas of the room. Unfortunately, some of these locks require entering colors that match the colors of other items in the room, and if you are colorblind or have difficulty distinguishing colors, as I do, it makes solving those puzzles very difficult. I deducted one star for the color problem, but otherwise it's a reasonably challenging game, especially considering it's a free game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife is addicted to this show. It's 50% of the reason we got Amazon Prime. Now if only there was viewing app for Apple TV...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book...!!!  Even if you don't like racing, you'll love the story because it's not about racing, it's just what the main character does. The story is fantastic for all audiences (over the age of 18, in my opinion)...
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book has unexpected twists and turns but it's pretty dark. Read about 2/3 then thumbed through the rest bc I had enough. Characters are not likable and pretty tasteless comments about women. Disappointed in material and end was pointless.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I'm the photographer in the episode &#34;Fateful&#34; so I think it's a great program! Definitely for younger viewers, in their teens.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Perhaps you could make different levels that are age related.<br />All in all, it is unique game that I enjoy for hours.  Just let your brain free wheel.<br />Fun, fun fun.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a great piece of art.<br />My wife and I watched it together, and she being a native Korean, loved to see the close ups of individual sushi they presented.<br />We were both pretty disappointed in his views of women in a rather male dominated society.<br /><br />He would purposely give women less sushi, because he wanted them to finish synchronously with the men.<br /><br />That, and we find his work ethics, although pristine, lack family values and im being involved with his children's lives.<br />I would personally not look up to Jiro, or his dreams, but I do find this movie moving, and a piece of art.
0525478817|5.0|The teen characters are far more witty and saucy than any teens I have ever met, but the story is a poignant and honest journey into the darkness of life, death and God.

B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I love the Metal Gear series so what more can I say, playing through the whole series before getting MGS5 is a must for any fan. Only problem is there's no Portable Ops which is canon to the series, but I can understand why Kojima left it out. Also no Rising but it's a fairly new/easily obtainable game anyways. So if you're a veteran MGS player or want to start the series don't hesitate!

B004YW4L5K|5.0|I would have never picked up &#34;American Gods&#34; by Neil Gaiman had it not been for the ladies of the book club I attend. And to them I say, &#34;Thank you.&#34;<br /><br />This book defies classification. I haven't read anything else by Gaiman, so I don't know if he normally fits into science fiction or fantasy, but that's as close a genre as I can come up with for &#34;American Gods.&#34;<br /><br />On the surface, it's about a young man named Shadow who has been released from prison. On the day he's released, he learns from the warden that his wife has been killed in a car accident. And then he finds out that his wife was having an affair with another man, and was with him when the car crashed.<br /><br />So Shadow agrees to work for a strange character who goes by the name of Wednesday. They have several adventures and travels together -- and from what I can piece together, Wednesday is trying to get all the old gods together to fight the new gods.<br /><br />Author Gaiman takes names from established mythology and other cultures and mixes them generously. Some of the names I have heard before: Odin, Loki. But more of them are mysteries. It's a little like the TV show, &#34;Grimm,&#34; meets &#34;The X Files&#34; meets &#34;Highway to Heaven.&#34;<br /><br />Gaiman mixes everyday scenes with Shadow's dreams, and the combination is strangely compelling. Shadow's wife Laura comes back to him after he tosses a magic coin in her grave. When he sees her next, she is wearing it around her neck. The only problem is: she is still decaying, even though she appears to Shadow. And she would like to live again, if Shadow has any pull with the gods.<br /><br />The gods have strange new names and some of them occupy different forms or bodies. Laura helps Shadow escape from a couple of the new gods who want Shadow to come to their side. Mr. Nancy is actually Anansi, and Low-Key is actually Loki. Other gods have names such as Stone, Town, and World.<br /><br />And then there's the obvious Christ-like images in the novel: Shadow dies hanging from a tree. His mother becomes pregnancy with him when she's seduced by Mr. Wednesday. (He learns this much later in the novel.)<br /><br />And the version of the novel I'm reading is the 10th anniversary author's version. I can only guess what the originally published version was like. I'm confident it was much shorter. But better? Who knows?<br /><br />I just know I'm going to have a sleepless night when I get down to the end of this book. I'm not going to be able to put it down until I find out what happens and who wins the big battle.e's the obvious Christ-like images in the novel: Shadow dies hanging from a tree.

159463176X|4.0|Not as good as the former two books.  It went from one story to another without a preamble or introudction and was hard to follow.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This was another good series done by FOX. Interesting stories, charactors and story lines. I especially, like the continuing background story. The Forth Season is even better.
B0074PNCRM|4.0|i really liked this story. it was very interesting and had a great<br />story. quite sad though not at all uplifting
1592402690|5.0|Here, There, and Everywhere gives us a peak inside the studio while the Beatles were at work. It's well written, and told by someone who was there. You know the Big stories already (anyway, I'll bet you do if you're reading this review), but this book recreates the atmosphere at one of the most creative points in our history. If you're a Beatle fan, interested in the history of rock, or even interested in the creative process in general, you won't want to miss this one.
B0031RS3K8|4.0|i liked this book. it was  quick read and very interesting.<br />very sad to think about this story though :-(
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|It is a lot more interesting a movie than I thought it was going to be. Just thought it was going to be fair, but turned out a lot better to watch than I would have expected.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|You would think with this excellent cast of characters and director, the plot line could have been a lot better, with more thought behind it, an just based a bit on some fact and reality.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Lots of fun get it now fun for every one<br /><br />Get it now free fun lots of friends to play with<br />LOL ........................
B008IGP8RI|5.0|The music on here was amazing I think I've already worn it out from listening to it too much! Everyone that worked on it did an incredible job! Amazon took no time sending it to me.
B007XAYKX8|5.0|This was a very good video for those who love racing especially motorcycle racing.  You received some interesting insight into the world of GP racing.
B001R10BM8|5.0|I got this book for husband as a gift. He is a James Bond fan. It was an important dvd to complete his Blu-ray Bond collection. Of course, we loved the movie!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love the HBO series, but I'm tired of all the superior nerds on Facebook and Twitter telling me I should have read the books so I'd have known what happened at the wedding.  Well, fine! FINE!  I'll read the books!<br /><br />What I've learned is that HBO is doing a surprisingly great job of following the storyline, at least for this book.  I've heard there are some changes coming up.  Anyway, I love it so far and can't wait to move on to the next book.
1881273873|5.0|I received the book in a very timely manner, in great condition. Great book; lots of great advice and help in understanding your spouse and/or girlfriend/boyfriend. Thanks!
B004C3DLJS|5.0|I need to purchase this movie for my son. He loves the characters. It's a great film for kids and entertaining for adults as well.
B002LAAB1U|5.0|I am an Integrative Health nurse and play this CD for my patients to relax during chemotherapy or during sessions of Healing Touch.  The sounds of nature and soothing notes of the piano have been appreciated by all.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good but didn't make the lasting impression Hosseini's previous books left with me.  I was left wondering what happened to too many characters.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I don't purposely go see Tom Cruise movies, nor do I seek out sci-fi movies, but I thought the trailer was interesting and gave this one a chance. Absolutely loved it. Visually awesome with the right amount of action and romance.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It's a fun game. Just wish you could chat with players and play more rounds. Otherwise it's awesome to play.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I thought at first I would not like this book because it was in first person form but, by the middle of the book it held me captive . The story came to life for me . Knowing about the hardships of slaves and how badly the we're  treated  was so enraging to me that it was awful for them. The character s were extremely real . I like this book more than I thought I would .Great read!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Good balance of hidden object and puzzles and super story line. The story and graphics were really creepy! Was a lot of fun to watch the animated clips. Great job whomever made them. I have been playing a lot of these HO/puzzle games, this is the best so far.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|If you take the film for what it's worth you will enjoy it. Though short on character development, it is entertaining and even if Hansel and Gretel get their butt kicked often, they never give up. I like it for its entertainment value.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|When you watch this anthology you realize how things have changed in terms of cinema over the past decades. These movies are pieces of art. Some of the not-so-into-alien audience might get bored because of the &#34;slowness&#34; of the movies, or the lack of explosions and special effects, but the &#34;thriller&#34; concept in this movies is amazing. The movies would get a 4.5 stars from me. The packaging, even though it looks pretty cool, is a little taller because of the hard case than the rest of blu-rays, which makes it harder to store in a regular drawer-case. The extra features are not that good though, but to be able to have the original and special editions of all the films makes it a pretty good deal.
B007REV4YI|5.0|One might think, but in actuality, it does as all other Bond films do, leave it open for more. Daniel Craig is becoming the quintessential Bond and I look forward to seeing more.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a fun game to play for all. There are no ads to worry about when you are playing.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|The new series of Ian Fleming's James Bond 007 featuring Daniel Craig is a more realistic cloak and dagger spy thriller than previous Bond films.<br />Daniel Craig is awesome as the dark and deeply troubled James Bond. Very well done.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This application is great for children. My two kids cannot get enough of this very realistic looking horse care application.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|Continuing the James Bond 007 saga, Daniel Craig is once again fantastic in his role as 007. Still darker than the previous Bond films, it provides peak performances from the principle characters. Again, very well done.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I've been wondering why I haven't read it before! For those who want to know what a &#34;real&#34; vampire should be!
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Definitely worth reading. Enjoyed every bit of the story. For a book I have to read in college it's awesome. Only downside is that it's too short
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome, takes a little bit long to load, but awesome!  I would recommend this game to everyone
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I Love This Game It's Really Fun And Easy To Play. I Play This Game All The Time. It's Really Fun For Kids Too.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Such a basic concept, turned into a non-stop thrilling \\"cube runner\\" style game. No clipping with a fantastic challenge list and helpful rewards after all the effort. Bravo.
0061906220|5.0|I recently completed a student teaching experience in a class of twenty-five active kindergarten students.  Pete the Cat was one of the stories that this class found to be engaging.  Not only did the story maintain their attention, they enjoyed singing along with Pete's song.  This book shows an understanding of the concept of learning through music, as well as bright illustrations with simple text that children can read by themselves.  Is Pete the Cat a welcome addition to the long list of great children's books?  Goodness yes!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I uninstalled this app only because of the upgrade. Whoever was in charge of that choice should be let go. It's aweful and very User unfriendly. Change it back please! This was the best weather app before changes.
B00506NRBS|4.0|I purchased this book as ebook and added the audio book version. In the end I listened to the audio version only which is narrated by the author himself. The book is short and lays out the ideas and experiences Derek Sivers had while he built up his business, cdbaby. Even though a lot of the ideas can be found in a lot of other business books, this book presents them in a fresh way with a very personal touch. Worth reading or listening to.
B0015AARJI|1.0|The controller's top right trigger and button didn't work the moment I received it. Total waste of time and money.
044024613X|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. I could not guess the ending at all.  Once I started reading, I could not stop until the end. The characters were so complicated - very human. This one will stick with me for a while.
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|the album did not disappoint. if your a fan of LaBrie's work you should defiantly check this album out. Impermanent Resonance overal is a great album.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game &amp; a good way to spend time during your flights! Also good at the airport while waiting for your flight
B007MC8YLQ|1.0|This game is very hard to operate, slow. I wish I hadn't downloaded it. I will eventually delete from my kindle.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I use this in class when my middle school science kids finish early and do very well-they love it. It takes a while to master-even my husband enjoys playing with it:)
B008HK3XOU|2.0|Dont like that the product doesn't support the kindle as it should.<br />Product is not firm enough, it got misshapen very easily.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|A wonderful movie for teen girls.  Lessons of family responsibility and love of home are emphasized. Also, dignity and grace.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|At first when I downloaded this app I was disappointed that the no3 downloads wouldn't work. They would just show up in my music file as 0:00. So I immediately deleted the application in disappointment. But the a week or so later I looked into my videos and the two items that I downloaded were right there. Note to app developer's please fix the mp3 portion of this app
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is a great little cutesy collect the stars mobile game. It uses a new twist to good old fashioned slide puzzles, similar. Given that they're the same studio that created Cut the Rope (and Cut the Rope: Experiments more to this point) you can expect the same introduction of crazy gadgets to make it harder as well. It's got a cute art style and I imagine for children it would be perfect too since it's mildly educational (in that it gets them thinking outside of the box) but not bluntly in your face about it.<br /><br />My sole complaint with this game is that it has a pretty lazy difficult curb. I enjoyed it enough to get to the harder puzzles in world 4, but it was extremely easy up to that point. Once you get there though, the introduction of needing to create the monsters on top of just sliding them around makes things quite a bit harder. I enjoy a challenge though, so it was all in good fun.<br /><br />I think this game is worth a try. It's got limited replayability once you've beaten it but it's a solid experience and it has plenty of levels to entertain you in bite sized chunks for a few weeks at least. ZeptoLab is also very good about releasing levels after the fact, and usually at no additional charge.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The only thing I can say is...great show! Everything about the show is awesome...I highly recommend watching all 4 seasons.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|DVD arrived in good shape and has a good picture and the sound is good quality too. three more words required
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Guess the emoji is a fun game but I Think there should be a way to get free coins. If I were u I would definitely get the game :)
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Uno &amp; Friends is a really fun game that you can sit down and play for a long time. The only thing I don't like is that you have to use revives to play each time and the revives run out very fast. So you can only play like once or twice before you are out and then, you have to wait a day to get 2 or 3 more revives unless you want to waste your money buying 20 for $2.00. But over all the game is very fun.
B00E8B1358|2.0|Don't waste your time with this one; it's pretty bad and not even &#34;mildly entertaining&#34;. The first G.I. Joe was decent, but this one is a joke.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen lately, the story behind the story is awesome. Highly recommend it, is a must see.
0553565915|5.0|I have read about many life after death experiences but this one is truly the best. It gives the most clear description of what Heaven is like than anything I have read. There are a couple of things she says that I am not quite sure I believe but the overall is incredible. I, too, had a dream once where I met my daughter who had passed on in a place that I can still see today...it was the same description that she describes in her chapter &#34;The Garden&#34;. Amazing. I read it over and over to keep me in constant remembrance of the incredible love of God and the warmth of his presence...of the wonderful and exciting world that awaits us...and to remember that death is nothing to fear because we don't really 'die' we just graduate on to the next level of our spiritual life. I can't wait to experience the love of God, his compassion and forgiveness that awaits us on the other side--plus see all our loved ones that are waiting for us. I know that 'my mission' in this life needs to be fulfilled before I pass on and that only God knows when that mission is complete and its my time to go..I just need to trust in Him and know HIS TIMING for each of us is perfect.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Unpredictable story line. The writing felt very authentic as Sid the characters. Loved the epilogue!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I went into this with low expectations but decided to give it a shot. I was blown away with how much I enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to get to the next page.  Not only a great read but really makes you think about what our future could be like.  Main character is great and makes you laugh out loud with his thoughts. I ended up ordering all the other books in the series and haven't been upset.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Good for grandparents to watch with their grandkids. I liked the action and the story line. A fun movie for all ages.

B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|It's not often that I fall asleep in a movie and decide that it's not worth rewinding. I got bored and fell asleep the first time, but I figured it would hold my attention when I had company. Wrong. I woke up and my friend was looking at her phone instead. There is very little character development , if any. It's not good sci-fi at all. The drones are Star Wars throwbacks at best, and his hi tech bike is lame! Only Tom Cruise can fall several stories several times in a movie, but not even break a bone or limp afterwards. This is shallow nonsense. Just throwing Morgan Freeman in a movie these days is supposed to give it gravitas! Wrong. This was so predictable and lame -take a bit from Star Wars, Total Recall and The Matrix, take out the imagination, great or at least interesting dialogue and characters, and you get this plodding attempt at filmmaking. There are so many excellent sci-fi movies around now to settle for this lukewarm drivel. Determined to get my money's worth, I tried again, and forced myself to watch it. But then I realized that my time is worth more than I wasted renting this movie. I'm just glad that I did not buy it out right. As confusing as the Cloud Atlas was, it was at least interesting with characters to like or dislike. This movie was a waste on every level.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I have never benn compelled to write a review, but this book simply will not go neatly away. I can't stop thinking about it, and it leaves me hungering for more information, stories or insights on North Korea.  This book has made me so grateful for my own life, and so much more aware of the real suffering around us.  I believe it will have a significant impact for generations to come. A must read.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love it. had finished all my angry bird games with 3 stars in every level and was missing it, but thanks to the new rio i'm back at it. this one is just as fun and more challenging than the first. have fun!

B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|With much foreshadowing of The Wizard of Oz, suspension of the knowledge that Dorothy's entire adventure was actually all a dream made this movie great fun.  I'm glad it wasn't a musical--it made it all seem more real.  All of us want to believe Oz wasn't a dream anyway.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Most Amazing Book<br /><br />I gave this rating because it deserves it.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone because it is this amazing.
B007Y36K46|5.0|This is really a great movie! I'd love to see a sequel but Disney said that it was a flop in theaters, probably because there was very few commercials for it. But after watching it, it's an awesome movie that deserves 5 stars. It's funny, has action, sci fi, and hot marsian girls haha.

1781162646|5.0|Loved this new novel, NOT CrEEPY, just a character-driven mystery with a nostalgic feel. It had a Water for Elephants vibe about it. I hadn't tried to read any King since The Stand, but in hopes that this wasn't horror, I bought it and really enjoyed it. The cover has a \\"pulp fiction\\" feel; the novel wasn't like that so I felt a disconnect there. Get a new cover, Mr. King!<br />Much aloha<br />Toby Neal, author of the Lei Crime Series
B002SAUCBC|5.0|It was fantastic!  Such a great book!  It should be required reading for everyone who loves to read. :-) :-)
B008OOYALE|4.0|Loved this game, played it multiple times throughout the day for months...a few months back I was devastated when I broke my old phone and couldn't play but technical support was so helpful and helped transfer my storm id to a new device and I was thrilled. Recently I  got a new kindle fire HD and re installed all of my favorite games into my new device and suddenly it costs so much food to evolve my dragons I've just lost interest.....they made it impossible to progress any further and the new habitats are so much I've had to sell dragon eggs I've worked at getting for literally weeks and months....no fair guys I understand the new changes far as new dragons and habitats but not the feeding stuff....how can you change something that's always Been one way suddenly it's not fair and I'm over it
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|Until the movie came out in 1983, Scarface meant Al Capone to most of my generation. This was popular culture emanating from the Howard Hawks film of 1932, based on Maurice Coons' book about Al Capone, the notorious prohibition era gangster.<br />This book is about the 1983 box office smash hit, directed by Brian de Palma and starring Al Pacino, as the unforgettable Tony Montana.<br />Whereas the movie was great, this book is terrific. It is choc full of details; things one was curious about and many that we did not know enough to ask. Some may think that the abundance of such minutiae is over-the-top and even overwhelming, but for cinephiles and movie lovers it is a treasure trove. No stone is left unturned, from Oliver (Stone) to Miami Vice; the genesis of the script, contracts, negotiations, casting, locations, theme music and photography down to the angles and lighting are described.<br />The similarities with original Hawks film, the influence of Star Wars, the resentment of the Cuban community of Miami and the anti-Semitic undertones are all discussed. The book is evidently the product of extensive in-depth research ,with access to primary sources, by someone who is very knowledgeable about the subject.<br /><br />It is a great movie guide and a film history book that should be included in every cinephile's library.
0385349947|5.0|Great book about modern day women's struggle for and keeping leadership mindset. Its a great read for anyone wishing to move their own leadership skills to the next level.  Also a great book for men to see what all the hype is about women in leadership roles.

B009KG7EMC|5.0|Last Stand, RED, Expendables - all are recent, well-done franchise action movies for Boomers by Boomers. Love seeing our action heroes altogether as they approach their Golden Years in American-style action movies with no overt or covert Hollywood political statement being made. Just kicking butt with no one hogging an \\"ego\\" role. They must have had fun making these.

159420411X|5.0|Just a short note to say how much I liked this book.  It's all good, but I particularly appreciated Chapter 8 on Bayesian statistics. I took a full year course in college on probability and statistics, and I learned a lot new about the subject from just this chapter.  Anyone who's serious about thinking about predictions (which is pretty much everyone) should read this book.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|100% recommendation from me to any avid reader of literature.  Adventure, breath-taking and also true-life, amassed from histories and diaries of the British Navy from the turn of the 18th to 19th centuries during the war with Bonaparte. The mix is humor/friendship/adventure peopled with charismatic figures who live for the sea.  There is an odd poetic weight and rhythm to the passages of nautical description - some impenetrable to the non-sailor.  No engines, no horses, only men and the marine technology.  I have started re-reading this favorite series after 30 years and am delighted again.<br /><br />The main characters are all men but there is no male-chauvinism, and I noticed no racism.  Even a Frenchman could enjoy this book.

B0011MZOEI|4.0|I liked this movie.  I found it entertaining with lots of action and, for a change, not a lot of obscenity!  Rare to have a film in which the &#34;F&#34; word is used ever other word.  There are people in the world who can put together a sentence without using the &#34;F&#34; word; not many, but a few!  Not a lot of guts and blood either.  I feel that it touched on the pulse of our addiction to electronics!  Where would people today be without all their satelite-linked devices?  This world would come to a stand still.  I like the way that Bruce Willis' character reminds the computer nerd that &#34;the world&#34; involves PEOPLE not hand-held machines!  This movie is scary as it brings to the forefront our dependency on computers.  EVERYTHING is linked to computers!  Take down the satelites and electricity, and we're dead in the water.  No banking, no communication; heck, no gasoline pumps!  Everything runs on electricity in this day and age.  This movie should act as a wake up call to our society.
1582701709|5.0|This book helped me a lot when I was in my lowest point three years ago... It lifted up my spirit. I was a believer.. I acted as if I already had it, and I had tears in my eyes when I was believing it...<br />Then the miracle happened... I had what I always wanted in my life, what I thought I would never had, the most precious and beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life....<br />I am a true believer...and I still read the book sometime to remind me how important is it to keep positive and grateful....
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I have to admit, I didn't see this movie until I watched Red2.  I LOVED Red2 and my sister told me about Red.  I got a copy and fell in love with the movie!  Talk about action and excitement! I love the &#34;mature&#34; actors!  When Richard Dryfess appeared I just about died laughing!  What a suprise!  All I can say is, there's life in us old dogs afterall!  All these &#34;retired&#34; agents (Retired and Extremely Dangerous-RED) showing that they still got the stuff.  I don't want to give away the story, so I'll just say that if you like a good, action-filled movie without a lot of &#34;F&#34; words and gore, you'll probably love this movie.  The action doesn't stop from the time Ben's Christmas decorations get taken out until the final &#34;chase&#34; scene with John Malkovich (wearing a dress) riding in a handcart pushed by Bruce Willis!  A fun, lively, action-filled movie. Enjoy!

B000N3ST3Y|5.0|This excellent CD shows the musical evolution of the band Genesis from the band's early years with lead singer Peter Gabriel to later years with the drummer turned lead singer Phil Collins. All the songs on this CD were hits and show how the band went from a more avant garde feel to later becoming popular with their radio friendly rock-pop songs. When Peter Gabriel left the band in the early 1970's, Phil Collins took the band into its famous radio years beginning with \\"Follow You Follow Me\\", \\"Abacab\\", then the bands mega hit album \\"Invisible Touch\\" in 1985 with a lot of their hits like \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"Throwing it All Away\\", \\"Tonight Tonight\\" and many more to the bands last hit like \\"I Can't Dance\\".<br />Phil Collins announced his retirement from the band and from singing in 2011. Lets hope sometime soon that he will change his mind and reunite Genesis so we can enjoy them even more. However, if or when that happens, this greatest hits will remind listeners and fans of Genesis why they were at the top of the music charts for many years. Highly Recommended CD!
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I enjoyed this game. It kept my Interest and was alot of fun.it was a little scary and had some suprise moments. It had many instances that actually made me jump out of my seat. I played this game over a few days and it was pretty easy,but not so easy that I was annoyed. It was fun but honestly I kept forgetting what I was doing in the game, so I thought the plot line could have been clearer. I also don't like paying 4.99 a game, this game isn't a game you can play over and over. I played it and its done. 2.99 would have been a better price.

A delightful mixture of blues-rock, rock and roll,<br />  easy-listening popular music, the blues and music hall pop, Clapton serves up yet<br />  a special diverse combination, compared to the mighty rock and roll masterpieces<br />  and blues-rock persona he became internationally famous for, as the CD manage<br />  to become another of his finest albums.

But despite some mixed reviews,<br />  you will find \\"Clapton\\" to be a highly accomplished, yet stunning masterwork from<br />  The Guitar God, where it explores new phrases and stunning performances in his<br />  world class artistry, which is done with virtuosity and soul.

B000WT5J4Q|5.0|In 1974, a year after he made his comeback following his brief drug addiction that          nearly destroyed him, Eric Clapton released this highly praised masterpiece which is          unanimously hailed as his crowning achievement as it finds him exploring fresh new          exciting directions as it became a fascinating universal hit.  Highlighted by sweeping           guitar solos, harmonic artistry, high-rocking performances and outstanding compos-         ing, 461 Ocean Boulevard well-showcases The Guitar God in a highly sophisticated,          modem and a more progressive approach in his music while he maintains his trade-         mark cutting edge guitar perfection that bought him new audiences and outstanding          equal success.

What add to the landmark success of          461 Ocean Boulevard is that it bring the pop concessions of the album for which the          sleek production never detract from his high-rocking origins and artistic roots, as the          relaxed, friendly atmosphere sets the template for Clapton's uncanny career.  What          you will get on the Deluxe Edition are few highlights from two concert performances          he gave at The Hammersmith Odeon later that year, which makes this the definitive          edition of it's kind.  Thanks to Polydor (whom Clapton have recorded with from 1967          to 1981) and the Universal Music Group, we will truly enjoy 461 Ocean Boulevard in          a more comprehensive and up to date sound that makes this crowning achievement          an even more spectacular and enlightening music experience than ever since it first          came out.  Now this Is how this timeless rock masterpiece is meant to sound like!

B00AJMTZ50|5.0|While Eric Clapton kept on topping the rock and pop charts for the rest of the 1970’s<br />  and appeared at live venues on a regular basis, The Guitar God deeply impressed the<br />  music world in 1977 with this ambitious landmark album that not only became another<br />  great masterpiece, but what perhaps as his most sophisticated original album to date.<br />  Produced with world class excellence, finesse, ambience and richly diverse melodies,<br />  Slowhand highly showcases Clapton in his most original and sophisticated form as he<br />  offers a high fidelity mixture of enlightened music, which is peppered by dashes of the<br />  blues, mainstream rock, pop and country and western as they deliver it’s full house of<br />  bright intelligent notes from start to finish.

B004SF2YES|5.0|Released to sweeping international acclaim in 1970, the same year his long-awaited<br />  self-titled debut album came out, this groundbreaking blockbuster extravaganza brought<br />  Eric Clapton to a bold new artistic high point in his career where he gathered up a group<br />  of musicians consisting of several band members that had resulted in the making of this<br />  landmark recording.  As one of two albums he made with the short-lived Derek And The<br />  Dominos (which he headed) in the early-1970’s, Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs<br />  would become both a phenomenal success and his greatest hour where it showcased a<br />  powerful and explosive new artistic landscape for rock and roll, which deeply impressed<br />  the music world and his fans in particular.  Starting on the opening track I Looked Away,<br />  sweeping track set proceeds with other excellent songs, like Bell Bottom Blues, Tell The<br />  Truth, Key To The Highway, an electrifying version of Jimi Hendrix’ Little Wing and even<br />  the landmark hit Layla.  What makes Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs a powerful<br />  record is that Clapton simply tears through the songs with burning intense emotion, and<br />  what you will get on the 2-CD deluxe edition are a set of alternate takes on some of the<br />  original tracks (including a few they did live on The Johnny Cash Show) and other great<br />  classic takes on Mean Old Frisco and a winning instrumental-vocal jam finale on Got To<br />  Get Better In A Little While, which make it a more spectacular timeless masterpiece that<br />  will finally be immortalized in even greater in it’s remastered expanded format.

B00138JATK|5.0|While Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band remained popular and in high<br />  demand on record or live on stage, they managed to present their fans and critics<br />  with this special and engrossing hit CD from 2007.  Produced by Brendon O'Brien<br />  (who produced hits for Danzig, The Black Crowes, The Offspring and The Killers),<br />  Magic is a slight return to his songcraft he does quite well on Born To Run or The<br />  Rising and rock and roll virtuosity that made him a household name as The Boss,<br />  as Springsteen and The E Street Band gives us another set of high-rocking music<br />  done with utmost style. Headed by a stellar track set starting with the instant punk<br />  rock classic Radio Nowhere, it is proceeded rather well with other vigorous songs<br />  like You'll Be Coming Down, Livin' In The Future, Gypsy Biker, I'll Work For Your<br />  Love and the title track, as it showcases a dazzling blend that truly acknowledges<br />  the most personal, political and rocking aspects of Springsteen's music universe.<br />  With old friends, such as Clarence Clemmons and Steven Van Zandt on board to<br />  provide the energetic back-up, both fans and admirers alike are guaranteed a full<br />  force of rock and roll attack that has plenty of Magic.  Relatively speaking , it also<br />  gives a portrait of the artist who once again discovers the true joy of rhythm, rock<br />  and soul, while championing the human spirit.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I am already quite familiar with quite a bit of the music on this CD, however, I had never heard of Thomas Tallis until reading the Fifty Shades books. Amazingly beautiful.

B0028IHSV6|5.0|A Reptile, according to Clapton, is something of a bloke, as in some local character          you might share a pint with down at the pub. After entering the 21st Century in full force          and in great shape with the landmark duet album with B.B. King, Eric Clapton released          this follow-up album of the historic Riding With The King duet with this classic personal           autobiographal album in 2001. Once again, The Guitar God tops the album charts with          Reptile, which would not only gives us another of his best performances on record, but          briefly revisits his coming-of-age childhood on some songs on the hit album.  Featuring          another round of outstanding guitar stylings and fresh compositions, the solid track set          begins with the title track as it concludes with other quintessential classic compositions          Believe In Me, Find Myself, the J.J. Cale-written Travelin' Light, Modern Girl (not to be          confused with the classic Sheena Easton song), the chart-topping hit single Superman          Inside, Believe In Life, Find Myself and the superb instrumental classic Son And Silvia          (a track dedicated to Clapton's uncle).  Also added to this unforgettable merriment are          other classic standards, like J.J. Cale's Travelin' Light, Ray Charles' Come Back Baby          and a unique version of Stevie Wonder's Ain't Gonna Stand For It.  Also featuring Billy          Preston on Hammond organ and vocal back-up from The Impressions, Reptile serves          up another defining achievement that absolutely knows no volume-related boundaries          and bursts with high voltage artistry and energy to spare, which makes this a timeless          milestone that will remain as honestly fresh and vigorous, one that will truly live on for          the ages.  This one is a refreshing must for fans and admirers of The Guitar God!

B007CM9AMI|5.0|With Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band entering the 2010's as highly<br />  energetic and vibrant as ever, he delivered another highly lauded album in 2012<br />  that not only showcases his world class reputation as The Boss, but put another<br />  realistic spin on his compassionate artistry.  Containing a satisfying set of songs<br />  about hope, determination, bright moments and inspiration, Wrecking Ball offers<br />  a gritty and nonchalant performance that consists of dark moments or helpless-<br />  ness and how to provide a way out from any type of hardship while condemning<br />  bureaucracy at it's worst.  Packed with a solid track set, the 13 songs consist of<br />  We Take Care Of Our Own, Shacked And Drawn, Easy Money, Rocky Ground,<br />  Death In My Hometown, We Are Alive and Land Of Hope And Dreams, in which<br />  they showcase the drama, compelling tone and the hope for many.  So, with his<br />  songs about the possibilities of friendship and daily life just as rich as ever, both<br />  Springsteen and the band deliver another great masterpiece with Wrecking Ball,<br />  a challenging stroke of genius.  However, this CD also marked the last perform-<br />  ance of Clarence Clemmons, the band's charismatic saxophonist known as The<br />  Big Man, who died of natural causes and whose stunning solos had provide the<br />  heart and soul of The E Street Band, who's legacy will gracefully live on forever.

B001KWP5FC|5.0|As Eric Clapton enjoyed a brief commercialized period in the mid-1980's, The Guitar          God would soon realize that he needed to go back to his original roots that made him a          world champion rock star and his next album Journeyman would restore this reputation          in 1989. Signing his long-time record contract with Reprise Records, Journeyman gave          his fans and admirers the kind of relief on what they want to hear from Eric Clapton, as          this album topped the rock charts and became another masterpiece.  Featuring special          guest appearances by music stars such as George Harrison, Phil Collins, Chaka Kahn,          blues master Robert Cray and saxophonist David Sanborn, The Guitar God showcases          his world class guitar virtuosity, in which he gives it a vibrant and fresh mature listening          experience as it features a few classic hits including Anything For Your Love, No Alibis,          Bad Love, and the title track.  Again featuring mostly `new' original songs by songwriter          Jerry Williams, he sounds more convincing where his guitar playing contains a uniquely          muscular and his singing sound gritty as ever, while the track set feature another set of          standards that includes Hound Dog, Ray Charles' Hard Times, George Harrison's Run          So Far, Cray's Old Love and even Bo Diddley's Before You Accuse Me, while his guitar          playing demonstrates the consistently strong edge (`check out Pretending) which make          Journeyman his best studio album since 1970. Now get yourself a copy of this timeless          testament from Clapton's vast canon and put it in your MP3 set.

B001NZU7GI|5.0|As one of two great albums that Derek And The Dominos recorded in the early-<br />  1970’s, the high-octane live album In Concert, which first came out in 1973, was a<br />  true instant success, then 21 years later, it was released in a complete format, this<br />  time under a different title and a distinguished CD cover. When you look at the CD<br />  liner notes, Anthony DeCurtis calls Live At The Fillmore’s digitally-remixed version<br />  of Derek And The Dominos In Concert, with five previously unreleased live perfor-<br />  mances and two tracks that first appeared on the career retrospective 2-CD boxed<br />  set Crossroads.  We do know that changing the original album’s title- cover during<br />  it’s expanded or deluxe CD reissue is never to be tolerated, we would finally come<br />  to believe that this live hit did indeed deserve to get this type of remastered editing<br />  in a different manner (Remember: This cannot happen to any classic album which<br />  gets the CD expanded or deluxe treatment!).  Featuring its greatly enhanced track<br />  starting off with Got To Get Better In A While, the nearly complete live set proceed<br />  well on other classics like Key To The Highway, Blues Power, John Mayall’s Have<br />  You Ever Loved A Woman, Bottle Of Red Wine, Tell The Truth, Presence Of The<br />  Lord, Jimi Hendrix’ Little Wing and Let It Rain until ending with Clapton’s signature<br />  song with Robert Johnson’s Crossroads.  Even when the same live recordings are<br />  heard or used on Live At The Filmore as on In Concert, as noted to the remixes or<br />  been remixed and, as noted, re-edited, of this live performance that was recorded<br />  live at New York’s former Fillmore East in October of 1970, which was part of The<br />  Dominos’ only American tour, as five songs run for over ten minutes, and Live At<br />  The Fillmore showcases Clapton’s guitar playing with skill and provocation and its<br />  stark combination of blues-rock and rock that is done with unique style.

Released in 2001 as a         concert DVD, Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band Live In New York City         not only marked The E Street Band’s first live performance in 15 years, but this         spectacular live recording captures the high energy, the spectacle, the passion,         the sweeping music, a great audience and amour that Bruce Springsteen And         The E Street Band presented on this landmark live extravaganza (the live DVD         even went on to be selected as the Best Live Recording of 2001 in the general         rock music categories). With roughly four plus hours of great music and picture         perfect band performances, the concert event features some their greatest hits          including My Heart Will Never Let You Down, Atlantic City, Youngstown, North         Avenue Freeze Out, Born To Run, Don’t Look Back, Light Of Day and Thunder         Road, as well as their take with the Hank Williams classic Mansion On The Hill.         From the slow building intensity of Prove It All Night to the 20 minute joyful ver-        sion of North Avenue Freeze Out, Springsteen and the E Street Band gradually         maintains their precise dynamic control where they give their live performances         the atonement satisfaction where Springsteen and the band are still capable of         cutting to the quick with a lyric or leading a live on stage with the utmost crowd         pleasing moments filled with high octane virtuosity and high rocking landscape.         What makes Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band/ Live In New York City         such a tremendous diverse phenomenal success is that it includes the thought         provoking American Skin, a gut-wrenching allegory on institutional racism and         police brutality, the spectacular jamboree version on In The Land Of Hope And         Dreams where Springsteen The E Street Band sings and performs in grandeur         harmony and homespun perfection, while the DVD set serves up a exhilarating         round bonus tracks as the add to the finishing touch of the live event.  Plus the         DVD set even have the 15-minute featurette, entitled New York City Serenade,         where it consist of behind-the-scenes interviews Bruce the E Street Band gave         in such a brief and honest manner. However, I would truly have to recommend         this wonderful electrifying DVD concert event with utmost respect and honour,         where it will be immortalized for countless of ages as a world class celebration         of live spectacular music and band camaraderie.

B001KWN6ZS|5.0|In a move that would surprise many upon it's release in 1992, including his fans and          admirers alike, this live acoustic album Unplugged would feature Eric Clapton playing a          wireless acoustic guitar in front of a live audience as the live album became his biggest          selling album.  This `Unplugged' session would also be responsible for making acoustic          based music, and those unplugged CD's in particular, a hot trend in the early-1990's as          Clapton caught up with this `unplugged' trend at the right time when the public became          hungry for to hear how well those rock stars and their material can hold up of elaborate          production values.  By alternating between pop tunes and traditional blues songs alike,          the results was one of the most heartfelt and highly approved achievements The Guitar          God ever committed to the recording studio where it feature a set of tracks that include          the deeply moving soft-rock ballad award-winning Tears Of Heaven (it also brought me          to tears)--his heart rendering elegy to his son Connor who had fell out of his New York          apartment window because it had no window-safety bars. Eric Clapton even appeared          on a TV commercial pleading for apartment buildings to have window safety bars. Also          featured on the CD is an acoustic take on Layla, Running On Faith and fine versions of          acoustic blues classics like Rollin' And Tumblin', Alberta, San Francisco Bay Blues and          Malted Milk.  What you also get from the album's legacy is a Deluxe CD- Concert DVD          edition titled Unplugged: Expanded And Remastered, as the DVD contain over an hour          of unseen footage from the rehearsal and it includes early acoustic versions of later My          Father's Eyes and Circus Left Town. A Winner of Six Grammy Awards including Album          Of The Year, Record Of The Year (Tears Of Heaven), Song Of The Year and Best Pop          Male Vocal Performance for 1992, I may want to strongly recommend Unplugged from          Eric Clapton, and with a good time-honoured reason.
0307592731|5.0|Strayed is an open book in this memoir of her journey along the Pacific Crest Trail.  As one who comes from a different place in life, her directness reminded me that some of us can be quite sheltered.  But the author's raw and honest account of her own internal struggles kept me reading and waiting for resolution, waiting for healing, hoping for her sake that she would find some semblance of respite for her soul--and her feet.  If you're looking for a play by play, factually focused account of hiking the trail, there may be better choices.  However, if you're open to an account of a human being rocked to the core by events in her own life and trying to stay open to whatever the experience of hiking the trail might bring to her torn inner life, then I doubt you would find better.

B00EE3FVSU|4.0|The writing was wonderful.  I found myself drawn in by the characters, their emotional moments and the every day interactions.  In just one episode I found myself caring about these people and speculating about who they were and where they came from.  I enjoy intelligent television that can tell an adult story without graphic violence.  Broadchurch does it!
B000VWMUMS|4.0|In January of 1973, Eric Clapton would made his live comeback following his brief          year-long absence and rescued from drug addiction from Pete Townsend of The Who          after he was appalled of his drug habit, even though we have Townsend himself to be          thankful for rescuing Clapton from the drug habit, as this also led to Clapton's get well          performance.  Presented and put together by several friends that consists of the band          members of The Who and Traffic, Clapton would be given the all-star concert help he          needed as the concert at London's Rainbow Theatre became the instant success and          a goodwill ode for music camaraderie that is well-captured on Eric Clapton's Rainbow          Concert.  Beginning with the live opening take of Layla, the live track set proceed with          other Clapton classics like Badge, Blues Power, the exhilarating Roll It Over and Key          To The Highway, After Midnight and Tell The Truth, while Townsend (who mentioned          a social disease before introducing him onstage) gracefully performs with Clapton on          Presence Of The Lord, which help make this reconstruction of the comeback concert          something else.  Digitally-remastered in its own compete format and clocking in at 74          minutes, we will enjoy this Rainbow Concert session greater than ever where it turns          from a historic curiosity to a historical document of his comeback. The reconstruction          of the January 13, 1973 comeback concert by Eric Clapton was quite something else          for Polydor Records during the second time around, where the original album ran for          a measly 27 minutes and finally restored to 74 minutes which made it an even better          classic hit.  However, following this live comeback from 1973, Clapton had emerged          more powerful than ever for the rest of his mighty career while he has remained just          as phenomenal as ever sincehis comeback performance at the Rainbow Theatre.
1451627297|5.0|How Stephen King can manage to hold his readers riveted for 800 pages, I don't know, but I sure couldn't put this book down.  The whole time, I expected a lull in the narrative, a moment when I would definitely tell myself that this was going to get boring.  After all, I thought, the story of the JFK assassination has been told and retold countless times from every possible angle.  How can anything new come out of it? Well, Stephen King pulled it off with his usual brilliance.  Buy this book, you won't regret it.

B008JFUN6E|5.0|Fans of science fiction have been graced these past few years.  At a time when most of us have been too preoccupied with comic book heroes to notice-science fiction has made a stealthy but definitive comeback.  It wasn't giant sagas like Star Wars that kick started the resurgence either, instead it seems to have been brought on by smart, well written smaller budget or independent films.  As a long time science fiction fan, I welcome its return to relevance.<br /><br />I mention \\"District 9\\" in this review not only because it shares the same director-but also because I credit D9 as the beginning of the Sci-fi comeback.  With District 9, Neill Blomkamp gave us a wholy original, intelligent take on the genre and showed us something we hadn't seen before.  Subsequent small films like \\"Moon\\", \\"Monsters\\" and even \\"Attack The Block\\" (among others) solidified science fiction's triumphant return.  And though there has been a wealth of smaller quality Science Fiction films It didn't hurt that the big boys like the Star Trek Reboot films, Pacific Rim, Prometheus & the remakes of Total Recall and Dredd were also a return to form.<br /><br />Elysium gloriously keeps the resurgence going.  Though it shares a great deal of DNA with its older brother District 9-Eylsium benefits from a bigger budget.  Thankfully, that bigger budget always serves to ADD to the story rather than to detract from it and the film as a whole is a truly enjoyable experience from start to finish.  There's something about Blomkamp's directing (I can't quite put my finger on it) that gives his films a sense of gritty realism.  Though what you're seeing on the screen is make believe, it seems fully plausible and real, as if it really is happening right before your eyes.  I was in awe during several scenes of the film even though there were no giant space battles or marching enemy armies or anything even resembling such in sight.  There is just a sense of wonder and awe present throughout the film and it's allin the way the director presents the material.  This was true for District 9 as well but its even more evident in Elysium.  I'm not going to go into plot details or anything like that in this review-I really just wanted to say what a breath of fresh air it was to experience something so new amidst the summer bloat-buster season (Hey, I like the big budget stuff as well as the next guy-but there's still something to be said about story over explosions)<br /><br />I can't wait to see what Blomkamp has up his sleeve next.  I just hope it's another sci-fi gem like Elysium.  I could also see this guy becoming the next Guillermo Del Toro or Joss Whedon.  He's gonna do some big things in his career.
B0012216WG|5.0|What would turn out to be another time-honoured duet album from Eric Clapton,          he teamed up with longtime friend J.J. Cale for the recording on this very important          \\"shared project\\".  Containing mostly tracks composed by Cale--and two composed          by Clapton), The Road To Escondido is a breezy homespun masterwork that rocks          with passionate splendor and top drawer solos which gives this duet classic such a         exhilarating edge, in which Cale head the duet project with brilliance and rewarding          confidence.

Dedicated with          honour and respect to both Preston and Brian Boylance, here is a chance to check          out this free-spirited tour de force that ranks as one of Clapton and Cale's greatest          and most admired timeless masterworks as The Road To Escondido is destined to          live forever in pure infinity.

B008011XQQ|5.0|Inspired by Australia’s long-awaited decision to offer it’s collective apology to the         Aborigines in 2008 and the United States’ sweeping approval of the Native American         Apology Resolution signed by President Barack Obama in 2009, Carlos Santana and         his band have decided to make this inspiring album.  What is truly meant to be a part         of an encouragement to any nation that has not yet approved of their ‘First People’ of         a resolution approving of the resolution of their land and those who had already done         so, Shape Shifter is a powerful encouragement by Carlos as part of this international         effort, whom he recorded in an honestly told and rewarding manner.

Thanks in part to Starfaith Records         and Arista Records, Shape Shifter highly showcases the robust, but vivid, moral-lifter         to the First People who have finally received their resolution—both economically and         judicially—and others to receive there complete resolution by their own governments.         As another great and important landmark achievement, this compelling masterpiece         by Santana, one which is guaranteed to be another inspiring goodwill gesture for this         international movement to give first people communities the restoration to whom they         have waited for a few centuries—and the well-structured future that truly awaits them         with both pride and progress.
B001CFOPMQ|4.0|Reznor continues to not disappoint me. While others have fallen by the wayside, he continues to evolve as a person and therefore as an artist. While this album is not among The Downward Spiral or The Fragile, it's a well produced and emotionally satisfying album. Recommended.
B001L26THY|5.0|The blues may have played an important role in The Guitar God's development and          rise to international fame, Eric Clapton was eligible to take some time to record a blues          album from start to finish in late 1993.   For years, fans and admirers had waited for an          all-blues album from Clapton, and this CD have managed to re-create the ambience of          the Post-WWII electric blues era just right down to the bottomless thump of the rhythm          section. With the CD's ambience well-handled by Clapton's three dogs- Sock, Billy and          Treacle, From The Cradle, released in 1994, showcases a superb form of blues guitar          artistry which he performed with great success and sheer gusto, to which he take on a          stirring set of blues tracks that includes Blues Before Sunrise (also a hit for Stevie Ray          Vaughan), Third Degree, Reconsider Baby, Five Long Years, How Long Blues, Driftin'          (also not to be confused this early Herbie Hancock hard bop classic), Blues Leave Me          Alone, Someday After A While and Five Long Years, while it feature a series of classic          blues songs composed by Muddy Waters, Charles Brown, Elmore James, Willie Dixon,          Freddy King, Leroy Carr, just among others.

B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a typical Bruce Willis movie. It moves quickly with a lot of sarcasm and humor. Killings abound. It cannot be taken seriously. It is a great parody on other, more serious, action movies.
B001QD7SF0|5.0|As the 2000’s finally came to an optimistic, but a rather struggling end, Bruce   Springsteen And The E Street Band had delivered another time-honoured album   in 2009 done with just and challenging results.  Working On A Dream is not only   an aspiring CD that points to the hopes and optimism of the 21st Century, but it’s   designated to be a keynote for The Obama Administration, released just a week   after the inauguration of Barack Obama, the 44th President Of The United States   and America’s first African-American president, and not coincidently a little dash   of optimism within it’s 13 tracks.  What is ironic about this CD is that it delivers a   sense of hope served as a tonic to the despair and as a reminder that he’s still a   believer of the truth, where the stark track set begin with the woolly but sarcastic   opening track Outlaw Pete, where it’s well-proceed on My Lucky Day, Queen Of   Supermarket, What Love Can Do, Tomorrow Never Knows—one of his greatest   hits, Kingdom Of Days, The Wrestler (from the motion picture) and the exclusive   title track.  Done with elaborate and enduring production showcased by defining   virtue, Working On A Dream is a positive and compelling piece of music making,   told with brilliant storytelling and cunning artistry that can be also best described   another successful ode for those looking for a better tomorrow (you may want to   look out for the bonus track A Night With The Jersey Devil).  Plus, it even show-   cases one of Springsteen’s most stylistically diverse efforts which recalled some   of his earlier works as the uncanny chemistry made it a bonafide blockbuster.

B009LQKHIO|5.0|I actually enjoyed this book very much.  The author developed the main characters well and I found myself loving or disliking them depending on how nice or nasty they were.  The story line deals with some very human emotions such as happiness, sadness, sorrow, fear, love, trust, self-doubt.  It talks about hard subjects like spousal abuse, child abuse, murder, extreme possessiveness and unhealthy controlling personalities.  It does have detailed/explicit sex scenes as one reviewer pointed out, so if that sort of thing bothers you this book may not be for you.  I didn't have a problem with it as the sex scenes were not the predominant focus of this book.  Besides, if I find myself reading a book that does seem to have too many explicit scenes I tend to skip over them to get on with the story.<br /><br />Many of the characters have had hard, tragic experiences early on, and this book deals with how they helped each other to heal.  So in addition to the darker areas the book deals with, it also talks about the positive ways people can help others who are hurting and in need.  It talks about how a community can support each citizen and how family can include people who have no blood relation to us.  It talks about loyalty and commitment and true friendship.  It talks about the healing power of love.  I read this book because it was free and for the high star rating.  Now I'm going to read the others that are not free because I like this author and her style of writing.  I like the characters and want to see what is in store for them.<br /><br />Discovering Pride is Lacey's story and she is one of my favorite characters in the book I just read.  Go ahead and read Finding Pride.  I think you will come away with a greater appreciation for goodness, decency and true friendship.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|A little disappointed with a couple of things this being such a high profile application and the tie to much more income for the developer. I has often lost the page on my book. This is very frustrating as the book that it happens to most often is over 70,000 pages. I also do not like the book suggestions listed at the bottom of the home screen. Most are not relevant to me and many are offensive.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I suspect that's intentional, as the protagonist also ends up feeling duped at one point in the story. This rings as Brit Chick Lit and then grabs you and takes you through a journey containing tough moral questions. Just when you think you know where it's going to go, it veers in another direction. Unsatisfying, but real.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I use these to Skype all day long for work.  I have no complaints.  Clear sound and no one complains that they can not hear me.  I use them for gaming as well and they are awesome.

B000JLTRIG|5.0|I had already owned this.  This is a replacement for one lost in a house fire back in March of this year.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Couldn't get it to work. Unless you have a regular PC or laptop also to work along with android devices and kindle you can't find the IP address of wireless printer. Since I'm only using my phone and kindle now ,(laptop broken) I can't get my wireless printer to show up.

B00ECUARO8|5.0|My local theater did not show this movie but, they made sure to have Grown Ups 2. I was waiting for this one to come out. There was a lot of talk about McConaughey's weight loss for this picture. I thought it had to be a good script for him to put himself through that. It was worth it. The two boys in the beginning on the river reminded me of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. Then they meet Mud on an island and he is hiding out from some people. There are some twists and turns that involve a girl. It was not the same old predictable movie. I didn't think about what else I could be doing with my time or wonder when it would be over. I was hooked the whole time and wondered what was going to happen next. The acting was great. There was none of that type cast stuff, where the people had planned this same character in five other movies. It was a nice coming of age story about a boy who meets a fugitive.
145210655X|1.0|This is not a kids book, as advertised. It is not a story, but simply a collection of one-page comics that very few children would understand. Very disappointing.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's a great game, but if you DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OR GET RID OF THE BUGS it can take the joy out of it and will cause some frustration. On the other hand, when the bugs work in your favor... SCORE!!! So I suppose it balances itself out.<br /><br />Otherwise it's a ton of fun. It is a strategy game and will take \\"patience\\" . If you're inclined to want results NOW this game is not for you. Results can come from 1minute to 72hours, and the income/power reflect those time frames.<br /><br />So the adage \\"Good things come to those who wait\\" is true in this case.<br /><br />I've been playing the game since August, dealt with the glitches and moved on. Also, Gameloft WILL credit all loses you suffer, I know from experience. Still happily playing!<br /><br />Enjoy this game<br /><br />EDIT: I found the solution to losing your achievements ie, coins, buildings, battles, etc. However, I do this on my Kindle Fire HD and I stumbled on the answer by accident.<br /><br />While in the game, after you have gathered coins or battled or bought buildings or expanded land or any combination of the above, you need to \\"SYNC\\" your Kindle!! Do so by remaining in the game however, on the right side of the game`s frame you'll notice what appears to be a \\"sideways\\" equal (=) sign. Tap it. Your game frame will shrink somewhat. HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART! While your game is open, swipe down from the top of your Kindle and you'll notice the \\"settings\\" menu appear while your game is shaded dark. Tap \\"sync\\". Doing so will insure you don't loose any of your achievements.<br /><br />Once you've synced, swipe UP from the bottom of your Kindle and your game will reappear. In some cases, the sync will cause all your income buildings to pay out or if you're building aircraft/mechanical/weapons/training to suddenly be finished. Hey, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. It doesn't always happen but the glitch does work in your favor and doesn't disappear when you return to the game. What I do for insurance is to hit sync a second time. Then I \\"click off\\" the game correctly.<br /><br />Now if you've never shut down the game correctly, that may also be a problem. To do so go to \\"Tools\\", then at the menu bottom tap on settings, once that frame opens look at the bottom left corner of the frame. Tap the RED circle. You'll get one more prompt to insure you want leave the game. Once you've chosen YES, you've closed the game.<br /><br />TaDa! Believe me it took me a few months and an upgrade to a Kindle Fire HD to realize all I had to do was sync the game. Don't know how you can SYNC from a standard Kindle Fire tablet, but if you can, do so.<br /><br />Hope this has been helpful regarding this game. For Geekdominsurance is to hit sync a second time. Then I \\"click off\\" the game correctly.<br /><br />Now if you've never shut down the game correctly, that may also be a problem.

0802473628|5.0|I didn't read this book for a relationship, but to learn to love myself and what kind of love I value most. I bought this book for my sister and brother in law for their one year anniversary.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was a bit unrealistic. From a psychology viewpoint, people just don't behave like this. It was just okay, not great.

B00A429YF6|1.0|DVD was faulty and you wouldn't let me return it??!  I'm/was a Prime customer.  I tried to watch at my soonest convenience.  I tried multiple devices and players on which I play other DVDs regularly without problem.  Clearly this DVD won't load.<br /><br />What would you have me do with a faulty DVD that won't play?  One of your options was, &#34;sell it&#34;.  I won't do to someone else what you have done to me.

B000002LND|5.0|The Immaculate Collection does what many other pop best-ofs haven't done and does it incredibly well. It creates a new mix of all the hits, making them all sonically cohesive. It all ties well together, nothing feels out of place, and best of all, no song loses their essence. By remixing the songs to this extent, this collection doesn't fall flat like other Greatest Hits albums may. It's an album, not just a collection of songs sloppily tossed together.<br /><br />In addition, fans should buy this even though they may have the original albums with the songs featured here. The Immaculate Collection creates a heady experience no Madonna (or pop) fan should miss out on.<br /><br />The two new additions punctuate the album well. \\"Justify My Love\\" belongs on this effort. It offers the direction she was headed with the future Erotica album in an effortless way.<br />And here's a shocker: there's an underrated song on this album: \\"Rescue Me.\\" It closes the album on a high note with some of Madonna's best lyrics: \\"you bring me to my knees/while I'm scratching out the eyes/of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise.\\" It features some of her best singing too.<br /><br />Madonna, her team of producers, songwriters, mixers, etc. should rejoice. They've created one of the best pop albums of all time.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Good evening,<br />I already read Ender's Game several years ago, in my own language - that means in Romanian translation. We have in Romania a very good publishing house, Nemira, with a splendid SF collection - Nautilus - which gave us Asimov, Frank Herbert, Arthur Clarke and all the rest of the great SF authors. &#34;Jocul lui Ender&#34; (Ender's Game) was for me the first of Orson Scott Card titles and the book that made Orson Scott Card one of my favorit authors. So I have already bought and read &#34;Vorbitor in numele mortilor&#34;, &#34; Xenocid&#34; and all the others pieces of the puzzle: the &#34;shadows&#34; and all the rest. I love so much his books that I bought the first of them in the original language - english - even if I have all the titles in my library at home. And I think this fact alone tells a lot about my appreciation. I still consider Ender's Game the best of the series (as I consider Dune in it's series). Ender's Game speaks about the alienation of the genius children, that makes them so fragile and vulnerable, and also about their splendid solutions and ideas to overpass the day-by-day and the supplementary challenges. Orson Scott Card has also a message about the lack of responsability of the grown-ups, the ever escape liability of the adults. Ender's Game is one of the rare books that I read 3 times (maybe more) and I'm still interested to read it again in its original language.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is a very great game with no violence it can be enjoyed by anybody  my friend recommended it to me and I would recommend it anyone
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Amazing cast. High-quality production. Funny. Everything you want in a sitcom. The DVD packaging is nice and colorful and doesn't look &#34;tacky&#34; or cheap, like that of other box set artwork/boxing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was interesting to see terminal illness beneath the surface layer that the community creates around the person. I would highly recommend to anyone who knows of people and children struggling with cancer (so basically everyone).
B00170MYIS|5.0|Works very well and for the price it was definitely worth the money as it's nice to have a spare when shooting a lot of pictures.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is great as long as your device registers the movement properly but otherwise I love playing it is more fun than temple run
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Now that it has come out and not so expensive - wasn't about to pay the price when it first came out.  This is well worth the money.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I really liked this book, and first heard about it on Goodreads.com, and since I love the genre, gave it a try.  I wasn't disappointed.  It's a page turner, and the main character is pretty believable.  All in all a good &#34;light&#34; read.  I didn't give it five stars since there were some obvious hints early in the book about what might happen at the end.  It was like the writer got a bit lazy, and just wanted to end the book.  I did want to get to the end though to find out if my suspicions were right.<br />I have read better books, but if one is looking for a good fun read, this book should satisfy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love this game. Especially when it change country. It keep you focus. Great game! I will continue until I make a million which is very hard to get to.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|What is this?  Erotica?  Not as far as I'm concerned!  It was so hard to like the Mr Grey and so easy to wonder what in the hell was the girl thinking when it came to wanting to be with him?  I say girl, since she is never really described at all.  I had nothing to go on with regards to what she looked like, but dang if I didn't get tons of how handsome, built, hot, emotionally scarred Grey was.<br />There were sexual aspects of this book that disturbed me, and I would have quit it about midway, but I try not to quit things and think somehow it might get better.  It didn't.<br />I will say I skipped  the second one and read the third one, but I found the third one to be more balanced, as far as the characters were concerned, and the sex was not as horrid as in the first novel.<br />If I read about one more person comparing this book to Twilight, I will scream!  The Twilight Series were well thought out, the characters likeable and Meyer gives a great description, both physical and psychological, of each one.  The Twilight Series books are about love and adventure, unlike the Fifty Shades of Grey, which seemed almost childish and repulsive.

B00BR0SGN0|5.0|NOW WHAT? showcases the vast talents of veteran musicians who play with passion.  Songs are soundscapes of layered textures that take many listens to fully appreciate.  There's hard rock, jazz, pop, and even shock rock represented on this album.  The band is really enjoying itself, and it shows!

B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Tom Sawyer is a good book, but it is hard to understand because of abbreviations. Good for anyone who can speak old school.
B00932DCS8|4.0|The movie had an interesting plot, good story, surprising amount of action. I enjoyed it and think you will too.
B00B22IJXK|1.0|Exactly that:  Identical to &quot;PhotoEditor+&quot;, and not nearly as good as MS Paint!<br /><br />The interface is exactly like the photo-editor ready mentioned.<br /><br />The advertising is deceptive, showing results that this program itself actually could never produce.<br /><br />I've used MS Paint for several years and gotten results MUCH MORE impressive than what this program has done!  (At least with MS Paint, XP and 98 generations, you can do pixel art and even some gradients if you really use the Paint tools, such as Zoom and Custom Colors and the Draw Opaque options!  Think about that, Android developers!)<br /><br />One star -- because this app really sucks !!

1939416019|1.0|How can anybody write this: \\"\\"A breathtaking new epic fantasy series. Morgan Rice does it again! This magical saga reminds me of the best of J.K. Rowling, George R.R. Martin, Rick Riordan, Christopher Paolini and J.R.R. Tolkien. I couldn't put it down!\\" --Allegra Skye<br /><br />How can anybody in their right mind compare Morgan Rice to Tolkien and George R.R. Martin?? It is outrageous. It is overkill is is a lie.<br /><br />Morgan Rice has a fantasy out of control, I started on this volume, and got on till volume three, and found that exaggerations, poorly developed characters and exaggerations getting worse and worse.<br /><br />Morgan Rice needs a kind editor to help her curb her fantasy into something believable, with a sense of time and development of the story.<br /><br />The Hero comes from a field as a Cinderella boy character, who goes to the Kings Castle and in two days he is accepted as being the Kings ward, boyfriend with the princess and on it goes - Really! And in a few days he is accepted as the friend of everybody, after having been totally discarded in the first place. And it only gets worse. Avoid it, it may seem entertaining but you will end up disgusted if you have read and enjoyed Tolkien and George R.R. Martin.

B0058VW36U|1.0|Paid 99 pennies for this APP and it would not work on Kindle Fire.  Sounded like it could have been a game to occupy time.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Pros:<br />Sound is pretty good as expected.<br />Phones are comfortable but they do need some getting used to. Try them on for at least an hour to get used to them.<br />They have very good isolation and others can barely hear them.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The wire is kinda unwieldy and long and has tendency to get all tangled up.<br />The ear muffs does not seem to be of high quality. Need to see how long they will last.<br />They are big making it hard to carry them around for journeys and such. (They do not fit in front pouch of my laptop bag.)

B008476HBM|5.0|This story is beyond compare. It has all the endearing qualities one could hope for in classical literature as well as the accessibility of a quick paced novel. The story is relatable but far from tired, moral without imposition, and continually diverting with it's easy flow through the entirety of the plot. The underlying love story more than once invites sighs of admiration from its affected audience. We commiserate with the emotional turmoil experienced on both sides of the protagonists' affair, and are almost equally affected by the experiences of the lesser characters. The range of characters is wonderful, encompassing both the refined and the utterly preposterous. Something about the simplicity of this novel's time and place adds greatly to its effect, and amidst this simplicity a new, unfamiliar complexity of interaction, behavior, and expectation is unearthed. This is the most perfectly executed novel I have ever read. My heart gave way so readily to the characters and the enchantment of Longbourn, Netherfield, and Pemberley that I have  revisited, and continually enjoyed, the story three times now. I highly, highly recommend this book to you and anyone else who might be interested in reading a novel of substance. Please, enjoy.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I looked for something to use on my home network to play movies and music files wirelessly and this piece of software did the trick.<br />All I had to do was connect to the network from the kindle and then select LAN from the dropdown and it immediately found all the HDD just like on windows and it was up and making everything available.<br />You do have to have an actual player that will play the files but there are plenty of those around.<br />Es3 gives you the choice of player if you have several.<br />Great Job.

0399162097|4.0|I liked this book, I didn't love it. It was very well written and believable even though it was an unbelievable premise.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I know we all have those books that we wish would just go on and on and on. This is one such book. Though the subject matter is serious -- the German occupation of Guernsey and the subsequent cruelty inflicted on the residents of that beautiful island -- the manner in which the story is told endears each and every character permanently to one's heart. The story unfolds post-War as a series of correspondence between Juliet Ashton, a writer looking for subject matter for her next project, and various residents of Guernsey. Juliet happens upon the topic quite by accident -- one resident writes her asking for help getting more reading materials -- he has found her name and address inside a used book he has purchased. Thus begins a correspondence which grows to include a number of characters who lived through the German occupation and were all, for the most part, members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (I'll leave you to discover the origins of that intriguing title). I can't express how much I loved this book -- I'm presently on my second reading and envision reading it again and again as the years go by. Please get this book and read it, not only for the pure enjoyment of the story, but as a tribute to those brave souls who endured such misery during World War II and Germany's occupation of Guernsey. We must not forget lest history repeat itself once again.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|THIS SERIES IS ONE OF THE BEST I've read in a long time. I love the way it was written because it's not only about sex but building trust in relationships when you've had a dysfunctional past and learning to truly love and have faith in your relationship when you do find that special one.

1609611543|4.0|When I bought the book, I was more curious about what he had to say about wheat. And being a country girl, I new the wheat had changed in the years, but never had a clue on how much. He book well goes on a little long, but it makes you think. So the 1st of July 2013 I went wheat free. the first week was kind of hard but I made it threw. before the month was over I noticed my energy was good. Now I'm a 62 year old woman, very active and strong, but unable to lose any weight, weight watchers didn't help, or any other diet. by the end of the month I dropped 6 lbs which might not seem a lot, but for me it was, but my body changed big time I lost inches and my body got a lot stronger. so I still going wheat free, and this Aug. I will cut the sugar. and I will let you know how it's going.<br />It just wasn't that hard giving up the wheat, almond flour works great!!!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Enjoyed this movie start to finish.  I found a few issues with the plot(some things didn't add up, the reasoning for some things didn't make sense), but nothing to keep me from enjoying the movie.  Decent twist at the end.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm not a gamer but this was a great read so much fun! I really can't wait till Cline writes again.
1439156816|5.0|Wonderful book written in three parts...how Stephen King became Stephen King the writer...what he taught his students as a writing teacher...and how he felt after his near-deadly accident. (He was in the process of writing the book when he was hit by a drunk driver while taking an afternoon walk.) By the way, he's not the forgiving type. But he sure is the knowledgeable type. And inspiring. Just don't run into him with your car.

B006LSZECO|2.0|It seems to me that the author took the &#34;easy way out&#34; of this novel. I expect a real &#34;twist&#34; at the end that makes the read worthy, this one failed. I am recommending to my reader friends to skip this one, it only disappoints.

B0044DEAUA|5.0|Love this item. Easy to set up. Practically sets itself up. Up and running within minutes of out of the box. So easy to use. Once you figure out how it works. Simple, basic, instructions included. Going to get my daughter one.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I read this as the fifth one in the series so I am not able to tell you if it works as a stand alone.  The book was a great addition to the series and wrapped things up nicely.  The author does a wonderful job with her world building and in a genre that expanding exponentially, her books stand out as different and unique.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun to do on your spare time it does lag a little but if you have some good wifi then it is a lot of fun
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it and so do the Grandkids. They needed some prompting at the upper levels. Want more! When do we get an update?
B009AMAGQM|3.0|I had the opportunity to read the book series and found the movie to be very disappointing.  Pass the movie and read the books for a greater enjoyment!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app so much! I don't have a phone but I download this app on my Kindle it work's so amazingly. I highly recommend this app for people that have a hard time to send a message on their phone. Kik sends very fast which I'm very happy about.
0316286850|4.0|I kept hearing about this book so I just had to buy it.  I'm starting to get into wearing make-up and it had a lot of helpful tips...  I saw some reviews on here saying the book didn't really show them how to do anything...too many celebrities.. etc but one thing to remember w/make up: Make up is an ART & art has no boundaries meaning you can express yourself fully. With that in mind there are no rules to make up.. He's just showing you different techniques and ways to create different looks.
B009AMANBA|4.0|This is full of history, reflects political strategies well, and is generally a great movie.  More of a guy thing, I'd say.  I'd like just a bit more romance, but hey, that's a girl thing!  lol

B0092C2X7U|5.0|you have to land in the area where the orange cones are for all the places then you can move on to the next level
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|In my opinion this book was just mediocre.  I did not understand the significance of the supposed &#34;ocean(lake)&#34; in the story.  It was not a big deal.  The story was run of the mill, the characters never achieved any emotional realism, and I cannot understand the appeal of this novel.<br />I keep thinking that I missed something.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is awesome! But just because the minions move slow it makes it feel so much worst than Subway Surfers. Great game but it's no Subway Surfers and that's the truth. The whole truth. And nothing but the truth.
140006922X|3.0|The author has mixed the water of agnosticism with the wine of the Gospels and come up with an historical monstrosity of his own making.  The most serious lack is any knowledege of Second Temple Judaism, the historical period out of which Jesus came, of which the author seems totally ignorant.  Read my: &#34;The Jesus of History: The Need For a New Methodology&#34;, The Priest Magazine, August, 2006. The historical background to this book is wholly the product of the author's imagination, ecxept for facts already known, such as the Roman Presence in Palestine.  This book is simply a new form of trashing Christianity, with an appearance of scholarship and unbiased criticism. I would like to see the author's Bibliography of his methodology.  His is a reconstruction of the Gospel narratives based on his own ideosyncratic interpretation of Second Temple Judaism.  Who was he, based on the sources?  Something not touched upon in this book.    Where does one start?    1 - His entrance into history. 2 - The Historical Setting: second Temple Judaism. 3 - The Re-making of Human History.   4 - The Transformation of All things Human. 5 - The Redemption of Human Failure. 6 - The Transformation of the Human Potential. 7 - The Rebuilding of  the Human Endeavor. 8 - Seeds For an Unlimited Future. 9 - The Earthly Goal of Man. 10- Meaning Beyond the Visible Universe. 11-Death, Dying and Human Destiny. 12-Sacramentun Tremendum: the Undying Presence. Epilogue: &#34;Neither the Kraken nor the Lodestone Rock&#34;.  Father Clifford Stevens Boys Town, Nebraska....  .    Father Clifford Stevens Boys Town, Nebraska

B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I love Kevin Spacey as the totally opportunistic uberpolitician! As good as the original British series. Can't wait for season 2.
B008B1BL4E|4.0|I have a personal rule about topics of history.  Before commenting on a subject read at least 10 scholarly histories from various perspectives.  &#34;The Sleepwalkers&#34; would definitely be one of the ten that I would recommend on the subject of how the European nations drove themselves to one of the most dreadful wars in human history.<br /><br />This book's greatest strength, in my opinion, is also its greatest weakness.  &#34;The Sleepwalkers&#34; is focused almost entirely upon the political atmosphere of Europe prior to the Great War and my reading of history tells me that politics alone seldom leads to such conflagrations.  There were also social, cultural, economic and philosophical/theological issues at play.  For insights into those matters, the reader must turn to the works of other historians.<br /><br />My advice to the reader of this book would be to first turn to the introduction and then to the concluding statements.  Read those carefully before digging into the actual content.  In those passages the author stakes out his position, which, essentially, is that many modern historians appear to instinctively blame the Prussian-German peoples for all of Europe's 20th Century problems and turn a blind eye to the darker activities of the Russians, French and British.  The author sets out to prove (and does so quite successfully) that this &#34;Germanophobic&#34; view is utter nonsense, but most of us who read scholarly histories already know that.<br /><br />Still, I don't recall reading a history that offered such a clear portrait of the political atmosphere in Europe prior to the Great War.  The author paints a vivid picture of an elite ruling class in each of the capitals of the major powers making momentous decisions that would ultimately lead to the undoing of the very political and social systems that gave them power and authority.<br /><br />My greatest criticism of this work would be its title.  &#34;Sleepwalkers&#34; implies that Europe staggeredblindly into the horror that was World War I.  Such was not the case.  Many on all sides desperately wanted war; it was the cruel reality of it that came as such a shock.  Perhaps a better title, given the book's content, might have been, &#34;Europe Prior to WW I: A Study in the Human Capacity for Self-Delusion.&#34;

B003VPWX6K|4.0|Even though fiction it was still a very interesting peak into an era and attitude far removed from todays world.  I do hope Mr. Stevens made the best of his Remains of the Day.
